                                          Chapter 1

                      MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.1. Introduction. This instruction prescribes basic aircraft and equipment maintenance policy
and procedures used throughout the USAF. Any deviations from this guidance are prohibited
without Lead Command review and HQ USAF/A4L waiver/variance approval. For the purpose
of this instruction and development of maintenance policy, Lead Commands are Air Combat
Command, Air Mobility Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, Air Education and
Training Command, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, Air Force Space
Command, Air Force Global Strike Command and Air Force Materiel Command. As it pertains
to weapon system specific issues or requirements, AFPD 10-9 takes precedence. For the purpose
of this policy, the term AFMC Single Manager (SM) includes System Program Directors (SPD),
Product Group Managers (PGM) and Supply Chain Managers (SCM),
1.2. Organization. AF wings will organize according to AFI 38-101, AF Organization, or as
authorized by HQ USAF/A1M. Contractor and civil service maintenance functions are not
required to organize in accordance with (IAW) AFI 38-101, but will implement the organization
as outlined in their proposal as accepted by the government.
1.3. Aircraft and Equipment Readiness. Aircraft and equipment readiness is the maintenance
mission. The maintenance function ensures assigned aircraft and equipment are safe, serviceable,
and properly configured to meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include, but are not limited
to, inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment, troubleshooting,
testing, and analyzing condition and performance. All levels of supervision must place emphasis
on safety, quality, and timeliness in the performance of maintenance. The concept of quality
maintenance must be fostered by each supervisor and technician to ensure the integrity and skill
of each maintainer is not degraded. To the greatest extent possible, maintenance is accomplished
on a preplanned scheduled basis. Planning provides the most effective and efficient use of
people, facilities, and equipment, reduces unscheduled maintenance, and allows for progressive
actions toward maintaining and returning aircraft and equipment to safe operating condition.
Conducting a bench check of components and proper control of repair cycle assets throughout
the maintenance cycle are also critical elements of the equipment maintenance program.
   1.3.1. Preventive Maintenance. AF units must implement and manage the tasks specified in
   the scheduled program for their assigned aircraft and associated support equipment (SE).
   Preventive maintenance concepts are described in TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment
   Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
   1.3.2. Mission Generation maintenance activities must have the capability to launch and
   recover aircraft and sustain the preventive maintenance program. Generally, this means most
   units must possess a complement of equipment and supplies to perform on-equipment and
   off-equipment maintenance.
       1.3.2.1. Off-Equipment Maintenance—Maintenance tasks that cannot be effectively
       accomplished on or at the weapon system or end-item of equipment, but require the
       removal of the component to a shop or facility for repair.
 16                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       1.3.2.2. On-Equipment Maintenance—Maintenance tasks that can be effectively
       performed on or at the weapon system or end-item of equipment.
1.4. Maintenance Concept. Maintenance is organized into two mutually supporting networks,
Mission Generation Network (MGN) and Repair Network (RN), The MGN is optimized for
mission generation at the wing level and contains the minimum capabilities required to launch,
recover, configure, inspect and repair aircraft. The RN supports the MGN by providing
serviceable components/equipment and conducting inspection, repair, and modification of
aircraft and equipment.
   1.4.1. Requests For Assistance (RFA). If a maintenance activity requires assistance for
   evaluation and/or repair beyond unit capability, the request must be made IAW AFI 21-103,
   Equipment Inventory, Status And Utilization Reporting, TO 00-25-107, Maintenance
   Assistance, and TO 00-20-14, AF Metrology and Calibration Program, or automated process
   as approved by the mission design series (MDS) specific system manager (e.g., C-130
   AIRCATS, F-16 TAR). All requests for assistance must be coordinated through the Quality
   Assurance (QA) office and Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) Plans, Scheduling and
   Documentation (PS&D).
1.5. Maintenance Discipline. It is the responsibility of all maintenance personnel to comply
with all written guidance to ensure required repairs, inspections, and documentation are
completed in a safe, timely, and effective manner. Supervisors are responsible for enforcing and
establishing a climate that promotes maintenance discipline.
   1.5.1. Compliance Terminology. For the purposes of this instruction, the following
   definitions apply:
       1.5.1.1. Shall, Must, Will - Indicate mandatory requirements. (Will is also used to
       express a declaration of purpose for a future event.)
       1.5.1.2. Should - Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
       1.5.1.3. May - Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
1.6. Use of Technical Orders (TO) and TO Supplements. Use of the prescribed technical
data to maintain aircraft and equipment is mandatory.
   1.6.1. Units/Supervisors will:
       1.6.1.1. Strictly enforce adherence to and compliance with TOs and supplements.
       1.6.1.2. Establish and manage TOs and supplements IAW TO 00-5-1, AF Technical
       Order System
       1.6.1.3. Establish procedures for shipping TOs, E-Tools, and support equipment
       associated with E-Tools to support mobility requirements.
       1.6.1.4. Ensure all authorized technical data variances are kept with aircraft/equipment
       historical records until no longer applicable.
   1.6.2. All personnel will:
       1.6.2.1. Recommend improvements or corrections for TO deficiencies IAW TO 00-5-1.
       The AFTO IMT 22 prescribed in TO 00-5-1 may be submitted as an attachment to an e-
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        17


       mail to report problems of a TO. Official TO updates are the only valid authority for
       correcting a technical deficiency and implementing change.
       1.6.2.2. Continually assess the currency, adequacy, availability and condition of their
       TOs and supplements and be familiar with ETIMS, as they will use ETIMS to view eTOs
       in ETIMS eTO libraries.
       1.6.2.3. Ensure waivers to, deviations from, or additional technical data procedures are
       issued using approved official communication methods (e.g., signed letter, organizational
       E-mail, AMHS message or authorized automated TO 00-25-107 technical assistance
       request system, or applicable guidance from ALC). Ensure all authorized technical data
       variances are kept with aircraft/equipment historical records until no longer applicable.
   1.6.3. Lead Command will ensure any new or modified configurations or maintenance
   conditions are coordinated with, and approved by, the designated Weapons System Lead
   Command IAW AFPD 10-9 and the System Program Manager (SPM) responsible for the
   operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&E) of the systems and end-items prior
   to implementation.
1.7. Publications. Lead Commands will supplement this AFI. Units must tailor procedures to
the unique aspects of their own maintenance operation and publish directives (instructions,
supplements, and, for functional areas, operating instructions IAW AFI 33-360), for areas where
more detailed guidance or specific procedures will enhance operations. Units shall adhere to the
following procedures:
   1.7.1. Do not publish unit instructions or Operating Instructions (OI) to change or
   supplement TOs. Units must use procedures in TO 00-5-1 to update TOs.
   1.7.2. Coordinate directives with all appropriate unit agencies.
   1.7.3. Conflicts between administrative and technical publications will be resolved in favor
   of the technical publication.
   1.7.4. Conflicts between procedural technical publications and weapon system specific
   technical publications will be resolved in favor of the weapon system specific technical
   publication.
   1.7.5. Conflicts between Air National Guard/AF Reserve and AF publications are resolved
   IAW AFI 33-360.
   1.7.6. Develop, control, and maintain technical data checklists IAW Chapter 8 of this
   instruction, TO 00-5-1, and Lead Command instructions.
   1.7.7. Develop, control, and maintain functional checklists. Functional Checklists are not
   formatted IAW TO 00-5-1 and Chapter 8 of this instruction, but at a minimum are titled and
   dated. Functional checklists are required for use by functional area(s) during actions such as
   aircraft crash, mass loads, severe weather warning or evacuation, self-inspections, activity
   inspections, etc. Functional checklists shall not be used in place of or to circumvent
   technical data for operation, servicing, inspection or maintenance of aircraft, aircraft
   systems and all other equipment supporting aircraft and munitions maintenance. QA will
   ensure functional checklists are reviewed every two years for currency and document this
   review.

1.8. Waiver Request. MAJCOMs are not permitted to deviate from this instruction without
receiving written approval from HQ USAF/A4L. Units must submit waiver requests through the
Lead Command. Waivers should only be submitted when urgent or immediate action is required.
These circumstances are usually mission impacting and cannot be submitted as part of the
normal AFI change process. See Attachment 10 for template.
1.9. Field Supplements/Installation Publications. Official Air Force publications are the only
approved vehicles for issuing official policy and/or guidance. The MXG QA will be the OPR for
creating, IAW AFI 33-360, publications directed by this AFI. Units may create a Field
Supplement in lieu of individual Installation Publications mandated in this AFI.
   1.9.1. QA will review unit level publications every 2 years for accuracy, intent and necessity
   and document this review. (ALC the MXW Management Operations Office will perform this
   function)
   1.9.2. The appropriate Safety activity will review unit level publications affecting munitions
   operations or safety; including all locally developed checklists, instructions, supplements,
   plans, or operating procedures relating to nuclear surety IAW AFI 91-101, AF Nuclear
   Weapons Surety Program.
1.10. Performance-Based Activities. This section identifies the basic responsibilities for
managing performance-based activities (e.g., contract maintenance, Most Efficient Organization
(MEO), or High Performance Organization (HPO) except DoD High Performing Organization
Pilot program under section 337 of the NDAA 2004 (Public Law 108-136) which will follow
DoDI 4100). Additional guidance may be found in AFI 63-124, Performance-Based Services
Acquisition (PBSA) and AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program. NOTE: By definition, a
contractor, MEO, or HPO will be referred to as a service provider.
   1.10.1. Lead Command/MAJCOM Responsibilities:
       1.10.1.1. Designate focal points for organizational, functional, and technical questions
       pertaining to each performance-based activity program.
       1.10.1.2. Specify measurement areas and performance levels required for aircraft,
       systems, and equipment operated or maintained by performance-based activities.
       1.10.1.3. Specify the forms, methods of documentation, and frequency of reporting used
       to assess performance-based activities and ensures these requirements are included in the
       Performance Management Assessment Program (PMAP).
       1.10.1.4. Approve base-level requests that would permit a single Federal Aviation
       Administration (FAA) certified Airframe/Powerplant (A/P) contractor technician
       maintaining contracted logistics support (CLS) aircraft to repair and sign off their own
       Red X’s when sent to recover aircraft off-station.
       1.10.1.5. Identify the qualifications, training requirements, and responsibilities for QAE
       personnel assigned to surveil performance-based activities.
       1.10.1.6. Ensure units with assigned QAE personnel meet requirements of AFI 63-124,
       Performance-Based Services Acquisition, along with other applicable guidance.
       1.10.1.7. Ensure aircraft depot maintenance contracts, Statements of Work (SOW), and
       Performance Work Statement (PWS) are coordinated with the MAJCOM Munitions
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         19


       Functional to ensure munitions accountability and disposition requirements are adhered
       to.
   1.10.2. Unit Responsibilities:
       1.10.2.1. Designate a focal point for all functional, technical, and QAE matters
       pertaining to performance-based activities.
       1.10.2.2. Designate a MXG focal point (e.g., Environmental Coordinator) for all
       Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health requirements, compliance, and, as
       appropriate, worker protection issues affecting performance-based activities. The
       Environmental Coordinator will perform duties as outlined in AFPD 90-8, Environment,
       Safety, and Occupational Health/AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program and AFI
       32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.
       1.10.2.3. In coordination with the contracting officer and the MXG/CC (or equivalent),
       provide specific guidance to the performance-based activity to ensure proper maintenance
       discipline and flight worthiness of aircraft and subsystems.
       1.10.2.4. Develop and publish contingency procedures for support of continuing
       operations in the event of disruption, termination, or default of contract. This includes
       the provision of contingency procedures for the accomplishment of critical mission
       operations in the aftermath of natural or man-made events such as natural disasters, major
       accidents, and terrorist attacks involving chemical, biological, or radiological materials.
1.11. Modification Management. A modification proposal is a recommendation to change the
operation, use, or appearance of AF equipment. Modifications (temporary, permanent, or safety)
to AF aircraft or equipment are expressly prohibited without SPM approval. Refer to AFI 63-
131, Modification Program Management, for modification management procedures.
   1.11.1. (DELETED)
   1.11.2. Modifications to Munitions. All proposed modifications to aircraft-carried munitions
   shall include SEEK EAGLE certification (per AFI 63-104, The SEEK EAGLE Program). All
   modifications to AF nuclear munitions or their associated support/training equipment shall be
   nuclear certified IAW AFI 91-103, AF Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program. All
   modifications to AF conventional munitions or their associated support/training equipment
   shall be certified IAW AFI 91-205, Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board.
1.12. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS). MIS refers to automated maintenance
information systems that support and enable maintenance business processes. MIS will be used
to document maintenance actions and determine fleet health. The information entered into the
MIS will be accomplished IAW TO 00-20-2. MIS data entries do not have to be accomplished
by the same individual who documented the aircraft forms, but employee number/man
number/USERID of person accomplishing the actual work must be entered into the MIS. Red
Ball maintenance will be documented IAW Chapter 14 of this instruction.
   1.12.1. Units must use approved MIS portfolio which may be viewed by accessing the
   Enterprise Information Technology Database Repository located on the AF Portal. If a unit
   desires to use a system other than the authorized standard MIS the unit must submit a request
   to their Lead Command 3-digit Maintenance Management Division (i.e., A4M or A4Q).
   Lead Command 3-digit functional managers shall coordinate on all requests and forward
 20                                              AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   through the Lead Command A4 to HQ USAF/A4L for final consideration/approval. Upon
   receipt of A4L approval request for MIS systems procurement must be done through the
   AF/A4RB process.
1.13. Communications. Effective maintenance requires efficient communication. Radios must
be available to expedite personnel, equipment, material, and maintenance data throughout the
maintenance complex. Unit commanders shall develop communication plans according to
mission requirements.
   1.13.1. Lead Commands will develop guidance on the use and proper control of personal
   electronic and communication devices (i.e. cell phones, pagers, portable music/video players,
   electronic games) on the flightline, in munitions areas, hangars, and/or other industrial work
   areas.
1.14. Duty Shifts and Rest Periods. During normal operations, maintenance personnel will be
scheduled for duty based on a goal of a 40-hour work week. Maintenance personnel will have
their duty hours aligned to provide optimal mission support.
   1.14.1. Supervision at all levels will be equitably distributed to cover all duty periods.
   1.14.2. The following guidance establishes maximum duty periods and minimum rest
   periods for all personnel assigned to a maintenance activity. MXG/CCs may waive the
   following provisions during emergencies and advanced readiness conditions. Duty periods
   for crew chiefs and maintenance technicians traveling in their units’ aircraft are normally
   controlled by the aircraft commander.
   1.14.3. Duty time begins when personnel report for duty (this includes aircraft showtime)
   and ends when their supervisor releases them. A rest period is a block of time that gives a
   person the opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep in a 24-hour period.
   (NOTE: This rest period may not be waived for exercises or inspections.)
   1.14.4. Do not schedule personnel for more than 12 hours of continuous duty time. Provide a
   rest period after each shift. Time spent in exercise/contingency deployment processing lines
   and in-transit counts toward the total duty day, and may impact time available to perform
   maintenance at the destination.(This includes Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC), Mission Essential
   Personnel (MEP), Maintenance Recovery Teams (MRT), and normal deployment travel).
   MXG/CCs are final approval authority for exceeding 12-hour limit up to a maximum of 16
   hours. AC/Detachment CC assumes this responsibility in deployed/travel status.
   1.14.5. Personnel will not handle, load or perform maintenance on nuclear weapons,
   conventional munitions and/or egress explosives beyond a 12-hour continuous duty period.
   This requirement may not be waived for exercises or inspections; however, the 12-hour
   continuous duty period may be exceeded for shift turnover/administrative actions only and
   will be avoided to the maximum extent possible. The Group Commander or equivalent may
   waive this requirement during advance defense readiness conditions, actual emergencies as
   defined in DoD Directive 3150.2, DoD Nuclear Weapons System Safety Standards, or to
   resolve an unexpected event (e.g.; disabled vehicle, WS3 fault, hoist failure, etc…).
   1.14.6. In alert force or standby duty situations where facilities are available for resting,
   established norms may be exceeded. Adjust rest periods to allow for at least 8 hours of sleep.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                            21


   1.14.7. Ensure individuals are afforded adequate rest periods and breaks. Consider climatic
   conditions when determining work schedules. Stop anyone if fatigue may jeopardize safety.
   In all cases, aircraft commanders/supervisors ensure aircraft maintenance personnel are not
   required to perform duty when they have reached the point of physical or mental fatigue
   rendering them incapable of performing their assigned duties safely and reliably.
1.15. Maintenance Training. Maintenance training provides initial, recurring and advanced
proficiency, qualification, or certification skills needed by a technician to perform duties in their
primary AF Specialty Code (AFSC)/Civilian Job Series. Provide training in combat and sortie
generation skills not normally integrated into peacetime operations (e.g., munitions and external
fuel tank build-up, hot refueling). When balancing resources, (e.g., aircraft, support equipment,
facilities, tools, funding, personnel), maintenance training carries an equal priority with the
operational training mission. For maintenance training policy and guidance, refer to AFI 36-
2232, Maintenance Training and Lead Command directives.
   1.15.1. Cross-Utilization Training (CUT). CUT provides the unit internal flexibility by
   training individuals to perform tasks that are outside their primary AFSC. CUT is not a long-
   term fix or management solution for an AFSC shortfall. Ensure the training records of
   individuals receiving CUT are appropriately documented. Address questions regarding CUT
   to the applicable MAJCOM AFSC Functional Manager.
   1.15.2. For emerging weapon systems, extensive CUT may be necessary until proper
   workforce AFSC balancing and assignment is achieved. MAJCOM Functional managers will
   closely monitor the effects of CUT for adverse trends. NOTE: Prohibitions in this guidance
   do not apply to UAS (Predator/Global Hawk) weapon systems or other weapon systems
   where the AF approved maintenance philosophy dictates the merger of AFSCs.
   1.15.3. Weapons Load Training (WLT). Weapons standardization provides initial and
   recurring weapons load training and certification.
1.16. Maintenance Resource Management (MRM). MRM is a course designed to immerse
all personnel into the culture and knowledge of human factors philosophy focusing on the
importance, requirements, and implementation of MRM principles into daily maintenance
activities. Error reduction efforts through human factors will be used to improve processes,
reduce maintenance errors, decrease maintenance induced damage, and decrease on-the-job-
injuries. This will be done by integrating the technical skills of maintenance personnel with
interpersonal skills and basic human factors knowledge along with operational risk management
in order to improve communication, effectiveness, and safety in maintenance operations.
   1.16.1. To facilitate our common MRM culture, the Air Force’s Core MRM course will
   consist of a one-time, 4-hour block of instruction taught by a certified MRM facilitator using
   the mandatory course material currently documented at the MRM CoP,
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-AN-83. To meet the
   needs of our total force, MAJCOMS have the option of supplementing the course, in both
   frequency and duration, to meet unique unit and mission requirements. MAJCOMs can
   further delegate individual MXG/CCs the authority to supplement their MRM courses to
   address local, base-level requirements.
   1.16.2. MRM training is required at all stateside and overseas long-tour locations and will be
   taught to all military personnel serving in maintenance organizations. MAJCOMs will
 22                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   determine the applicability and requirement for MRM training for contractors, government
   civilians, and AF military personnel possessing a maintenance AFSC but performing duties
   in a non-maintenance role. Because of the challenges posed by wholesale manpower
   rotations, MRM training is not required at short-tour locations; however, these units will
   advocate MRM to the maximum extent possible in order to strengthen the cultural changes
   MRM requires to succeed.
   1.16.3. The AF/A4L appointed OPR will:
       1.16.3.1. Conduct annual course reviews to ensure currency of MRM course content.
       1.16.3.2. Coordinate course updates with HQ AF Safety Center AFSC/SEFO and
       AFSC/SEH for subject matter expertise, to include those areas such as human factors,
       fatigue, etc, and for current safety statistics.
       1.16.3.3. Ensure current course content is available on the MRM CoP.
   1.16.4. MAJCOM A4s will:
       1.16.4.1. Assign an MRM OPR and identify the OPR POC to AF/A4LM.
   1.16.5. MXG/CC
       1.16.5.1. Encourage training participation and attendance by other base agencies.
       1.16.5.2. When practical, ensure classes are populated with a mixture of AFSs, skill
       levels and ranks from across the MXG to maximize benefits of course discussions.
       1.16.5.3. Ensure course completion is tracked in the applicable MIS.
1.17. Maintenance Repair Priorities. Maintenance repair priorities are listed in Table 1.1.
This does not prohibit the Production Superintendent, in coordination with the Maintenance
Operations Center (MOC), from changing the maintenance repair priority when warranted.
Raising or lowering maintenance repair priorities does not necessarily require a corresponding
change in the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) delivery priority. During Operational Plan
(OPLAN) 8010 or operational exercise, the preplanned maintenance flow determines job
sequence. The maintenance repair priority and LRS delivery priorities are normally identical.
However, the Production Superintendent may authorize the use of a less responsive LRS delivery
priority.

Table 1.1. Maintenance Repair Priority Designators.

1.18. AF Munitions Policy. AF Munitions Policies are contained in AFI 21-200, Munitions
and Missile Maintenance Management, AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance
Management and AF Nuclear Munitions Policy is contained in AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons
Maintenance Procedures. Lead Commands will develop and provide policy and guidance on
managing and limiting munitions use as necessary . This will ensure munitions remain available
and in reliable condition and at the same time provide a realistic training environment and
support for exercise purposes.
    1.18.1. Live and inert missiles (or electrical simulators) of the same type must not be loaded
    or flown together on an aircraft for any purpose. Live and inert (to include training or
    practice) bombs must not be loaded in/on the same dispenser/rack or flown on an aircraft
    load together. Any request to deviate from or waiver to this policy must be coordinated
    through the WWM, and must be submitted via official message to the MAJCOM Munitions
    Division, Weapons Safety, and Operations Weapons and Tactics/Training Divisions. The
    MAJCOM Munitions Division is the sole approval authority for these deviations/waivers.
    Test organizations may load and fly live and inert munitions on the same aircraft for test
    missions only, as long as the flight profile is IAW an approved test directive that has been
    through a Safety Review Board process and flight clearance through the applicable System
    Program Office SPO/Seek Eagle office has been properly obtained.
    1.18.2. Request for waiver of, or deviation to, this policy will include as a minimum: 1).
    Operational Risk Assessment report and proposed controls to mitigate or eliminate hazards to
    personnel, damage to aircraft and support equipment or inadvertent employment of live
    ordnance, and, 2). A signed copy of the Test Requirement Plan, Test Plan, or Concept
    Employment Plan. Approved requests will remain valid only for the event requested and will
    not exceed 60 days.
    1.18.3. Captive Air Training Munitions (CATM): Safety pins/streamers for arming
    keys/safe-arm handles on CATMs may be removed for daily training/flying operations
    provided positive control and accountability is maintained for these items. (NOTE: AIM-9M
    CATM arming handles will be permanently removed). These components are only removed
    for foreign or dropped object prevention. Any CATM missiles used for exercises, Load Crew
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      25


   Training and inspections will be configured to the maximum extent possible with all safety
   devices and components to mirror the parent tactical munitions.
1.19. Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML), Test/Training Munitions List
(TTML). Operational units will use UCML’s, Test/Training (AETC and AFMC only (includes
ARC gained units in these commands)) will use TTML’s unless they already require a UCML
(i.e., NORAD Committed). The UCML/TTML is a list of primary munitions (PM), support
munitions (SM), and limited-use munitions (LM) necessary to meet unit operational/test/training
requirements and is published IAW this instruction. The list of PM cannot include more than 10
individual munitions or munitions family groups (MFG) combined per mission, design, and
series (MDS) aircraft assigned. The UCML/TTML also specifies the minimum certified load
crews required to meet unit requirements. MAJCOMS may supplement UCML/ TTML
processing, coordination and appendix requirements.
   1.19.1. As a minimum, UCML/TTML’s will be updated annually to identify all munitions
   tasked and/ or required to support test/training or OPLANs and Designed Operational
   Capability (DOC) statements. Additional munitions may be included on the UCML/TTML as
   SM or LM munitions if required by the unit or designated by the MAJCOM (A4M performs
   this in the ANG) to support test, training, or deployment. The UCML/TTML is the base
   document for aircrew and load crew training munitions forecasts, authorizations and
   operations. Units will start their UCML/TTML validation in July, and have a coordinated
   input to the MAJCOM Munitions Division in August. MAJCOMs will supply approved
   UCML/TTML to the units in September. NOTE: Specified months not applicable to ANG
   process.
   1.19.2. Unit changes to the UCML/TTML will be justified by Wing Weapons and Tactics,
   coordinated and processed through the WWM, Munitions Flight, MXG/CC and OG/CC
   before sending it to higher headquarters and MAJCOM.
   1.19.3. Standard Conventional Load (SCL) lists are not part of the UCML/TTML. They are
   stand-alone documents.
   1.19.4. The WWM determines the minimum number of certified load crews depicted on the
   UCML based on Unit Type Code (UTC) requirements identified in applicable DOC
   statements. The WWM determines the number of load crews depicted on the TTML as
   required to meet training unit syllabus and/or test unit mission requirements. (NOTE: WWM
   specifies in writing the minimum number of load crews required in aggressor units when no
   UCML/TTML exists).
1.20. Associate Unit Program/Total Force Integration TFI. The USAF employs the
Associate Unit/TFI program in some locations where active and ARC units are collocated and
share aircraft, equipment, facilities, and other resources IAW AFPD 90-10, Total Force
Integration Policy. Lead Command maintenance policy directives and enforcement as they
pertain to aircraft, equipment, and facilities are as follows: ANG/AFRC owns the aircraft in an
Active Association, ANG/AFRC maintenance policy will be followed by AD personnel, AFRC
owns the aircraft in an ARC Association, AFRC maintenance policy will be followed by ANG
personnel, AD owns the aircraft in an Classic Association, AD maintenance policy will be
followed by ANG/AFRC personnel.

                                              SAFETY

2.1. General Safety Guidance. Maintenance personnel are exposed to a large variety of
hazardous situations, machinery, equipment, and chemicals. Most hazardous situations can be
avoided by following procedures, asking for help when needed, and using personal protective
equipment (PPE). Supervisors must be knowledgeable of and enforce AFOSHSTDs, TOs, and
AFIs applicable to their operations and ensure personnel are educated on safety requirements
applicable to the job.
2.2. Air Force Occupational and Health (AFOSH) Guidance. Use AF functional directives
and technical data in conjunction with AFOSH STDs, see Attachment 1 for AFOSHSTDs
applicable to aircraft maintenance activities (this list is not all inclusive). If conflicting guidance
exists, the weapon system specific technical data will take precedence.
2.3. Hazards. All managers and supervisors must incorporate Operational Risk Management
(ORM) within the workplace. Identify, eliminate or control, and document hazards to minimize
risk associated with uncertainty in the decision-making process. Additional guidance can be
found in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management, and AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
Management Guidelines and Tools. When written directives are not available for the task being
performed, the supervisor, with safety staff help, completes a job safety analysis (JSA) to ensure
worker, equipment, and work environment compatibility. Procedures for JSAs are contained in
AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health
(AFOSH).
2.4. Hazard Abatement Program. Implement and follow the AF Hazard Abatement Program
in AFI 91-301. Document safety plans, actions, hazards, and personnel training with the
appropriate AF forms listed below.
   2.4.1. AF IMT 3, Hazard Abatement Plan; AFI 91-301.
   2.4.2. AF IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record; AFI 91-301.
   2.4.3. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report; AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
   Prevention Program.
   2.4.4. AF Form 1118, Notice of Hazard; AFI 91-301.
2.5. Safety Equipment. Ensure personnel are provided the appropriate PPE (when PPE is
required) for the hazard and are trained in its use, inspection and care. Contact the installation
ground safety or Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) for assistance in the selection of PPE.
Review AFOSH 91-501 for additional information on PPE.
2.6. AF Mishap Prevention Program. Implement and follow AFI 91-202 to protect AF
resources. Ensure all personnel receive safety, fire protection, and health on-the job training upon
initial assignment and whenever there is a change in equipment, procedures, processes or safety,
fire protection, and health requirements. Supervisors must document safety-related training on
AF IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, equivalent form or electronic database.
2.7. Safety Inspections. Accomplish hazard assessment and identification through the
application of occupational safety, fire prevention, and health inspections, evaluations, and
 28                                              AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


surveys. Supervisors will perform self-inspections to assess the safety environment of the unit.
Most AFOSHSTDs contain sample checklists for unit self-inspections. Also, use locally
developed checklists tailored to specific unit requirements.
2.8. Flightline Safety. Adhere to aircraft flightline safety guidance in AFOSHSTD 91-100;
Aircraft Flightline-Ground Operations and Activities, AFOSHSTD 48-20, Occupational Noise
and Hearing Conservation Program, TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
Grounding/Bonding; and equipment TOs.
2.9. Flightline Driving. All operators of vehicles on the flightline must first obtain training and
possess a valid flightline driving permit. Follow the general safety requirements for flightline
vehicle operations found in AFOSHSTD 91-100 and AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled
Vehicle Driver, AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, and local instructions. Supervisors will
familiarize all personnel authorized to operate vehicles on the flightline with the aircraft
marshaling signals found in AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground.
NOTE: see AFI 24-301 for AF vehicle operation requirements.
   2.9.1. Operators must receive flightline driver's training on driving conditions and hazards
   inherent to the flightline environment and obtain a flightline competency card prior to
   operating any vehicle or equipment operated like a vehicle (bomb lifts, club cars, gators,
   mules, golf carts, etc.) on the flightline, even though these equipment items do not require a
   driver’s permit or license.
2.10. Work Center Safety Guidance. Use the general work center safety guidance in
AFOSHSTD 91-66, General Industrial Operations and AFSOSHSTD 91-501, AF Consolidated
Occupational Safety Standard, equipment TOs, and local instructions.
2.11. Confined Spaces. A confined space is any area that is large enough to bodily enter; and
has limited/restricted means of entry or exit; and is not designed for continuous human
occupancy. CCs, functional managers, and supervisors must ensure all confined spaces that fall
under their purview are properly identified, and implement a confined spaces program as
outlined in AFOSHSTD 91-25, Confined Spaces. Also see AFOSHSTD 48-137, Respiratory
Protection Program, and TO 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks and Fuel
Cells, for specific requirements. Supervisors will ensure all personnel required to enter a
confined space are properly trained, equipped, and qualified and the training is documented prior
to entry. For assistance in establishing an effective confined space program contact the
installation ground safety office.
2.12. Munitions Safety Guidance. Use munitions safety requirements found in AFMAN 91-
201, Explosive Safety Standards; 11A-, 11P-, and 13A-series TOs (explosive and egress handling
safety); Chapter 16; and specific equipment TOs. AFMAN 91-201 contains safety topics, such
as, explosive safety program elements, explosive facility licenses, quantity distance criteria,
handling of aircraft, remotely piloted vehicles and drones containing explosives, fire protection,
storage and compatibility standards, transportation, etc. The 11, 11A-, 11K-, 11P-, 13A-, and
21M- series TOs deal with the specifics of handling and maintaining explosive items or
components. Chapter 16 of this instruction pertains to the handling of egress and escape systems
and personnel training, certification, and decertification.
2.13. Lockout and Tagout Concept. Use procedures to isolate machinery or equipment (in off-
equipment areas) from all hazardous energy. Instruct all personnel in the safety significance of
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        29


lockout or tagout procedures. Find complete guidance for instituting an effective program in
AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard.
2.14. Warning Tags. See TO 00-20-1
2.15. Danger Tags. Will only be used when an immediate hazard exists and specific
precautions are required to protect personnel or property or as required by TOs, instructions, or
other directed requirements. Tags will be placed on damaged equipment and immediate
arrangements made for the equipment to be taken out of service and sent to the repair shop. Do
not use the AF Form 979, Danger Tag, for on-equipment aircraft maintenance.
2.16. Contracted Operations.
   2.16.1. Refer to AFI 91-301, AF Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection,
   and Health (AFOSH) and AFOSH 91-100, Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
   Standard, for guidance on AFOSH applicability to contractors.
2.17. Safety “Knock It Off. ” Due to the inherent danger to life, limb, and property associated
with maintenance operations, personnel require a means to pause or terminate an operation or
situation which they perceive is unsafe or too dangerous. When crew leaders become task-
focused, junior personnel are often better able to assess the danger; however, deferring to the
experience and judgment of the crew leader, they may choose to remain silent, missing an
opportunity to break the mishap sequence chain. Operators have long used the call words
“Knock it Off” in their profession; maintenance commanders and supervisors should foster the
same culture in their units so that a simple, but recognizable “audible” from anyone can prevent
a potential mishap.
2.18. Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Management System (ESOHMS) or
Environmental Management System (EMS).
   2.18.1. All personnel shall complete Environmental Management System (EMS) awareness
   training. Commanders or EMS management personnel shall complete EMS Manager training
   (ref AFPD 90-8).
2.19. Environmental and Health Working Groups (E&HWG).
   2.19.1. Installation weapon system squadrons/organizations will participate in the periodic
   Systems Group and Sustainment Group weapon system environmental and health working
   groups or their equivalent IAW AFPD 90-8, Environmental Safety and Occupational Health.
   2.19.2. Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety. Nuclear-capable units will establish an
   intrinsic radiation (INRAD) program to ensure that INRAD exposure for all personnel
   conducting maintenance, on-load and off-load, transport, or storage of nuclear weapons is “as
   low as reasonably achievable” (ALARA). Find complete guidance for instituting an effective
   INRAD program in AFI 91-108, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety
   Program.

         4.7.12.1.1. Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) debriefer - The LRE debriefer will
         use a standardized debrief checklist to debrief the LRE aircrew. The LRE debriefer
         will monitor the SIPRNET Skynet database maintenance log for aircraft debrief
         information. The LRE debriefer will also review the SIPRNET Skynet database
         maintenance log when notified by the Mission Control Element (MCE) debriefer and
         during the debrief after the final aircraft handback to the LRE. During SIPRNET
         communication outages, the CONUS and OCONUS debrief sections will use IMDS
         screen 837 Log Book to communicate aircraft discrepancies.
         4.7.12.1.2. LRE Pilot In Command (PIC) - Review applicable aircraft and
         Launch/Recovery Ground Control Station (LRGCS) AFTO Form 781 series forms
         prior to launch and relay pertinent configuration data to the MCE PIC. The LRE PIC
         may request the LRE debriefer and a system specialist to enter the GCS for on-the-
         spot debriefing and fault isolation. Perform face-to-face debrief with LRE debriefer
         at the completion of every handover and landing.
         4.7.12.1.3. MCE PIC - Review applicable aircraft AFTO Form 781As and Ground
         Control Station (GCS) AFTO Form 781 series forms prior to handover from LRE.
         MCE PIC may request the MCE debriefer and a system specialist to enter the GCS
         for on-the-spot debriefing and fault isolation. MCE PIC will annotate all aircraft
         discrepancies in Skynet database maintenance log in SIPRNET under the description
         block. Discrepancies will need to be as descriptive as possible and should be entered
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      51


        at the time they occur. MCE PIC will hand-carry GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms
        binder to MCE debrief and perform face-to-face debrief with MCE debriefer
        immediately after aircrew changeover, Ku-to-Ku handover, or final aircraft handback
        to LRE. MCE PIC will document GCS discrepancies on GCS AFTO Form 781A.
        MCE PIC will be available during debrief to answer question(s) from the LRE
        debriefer or deployed technicians.

        forms and place in front of AFTO Form 781F in GCS forms binder prior to MCE PIC
        receiving GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms. Review GCS AFTO Form 781 series
        after aircrew changeover, Ku-to-Ku handover, or final aircraft handback to LRE.
        Enter GCS discrepancies into IMDS and notify affected work center. MCE debriefer
        will not enter aircraft discrepancies in IMDS since this is an LRE debrief
        responsibility. Instead, the MCE debriefer will verify that aircraft discrepancies are
        accurately entered in the Skynet database maintenance log by reviewing maintenance
        log entries with the MCE PIC and/or sensor operator. MCE debrief will fill out a
        standardized debrief checklist for each in-flight discrepancy and forward checklists to
        the LRE debriefer. If additional maintenance log entries are required the MCE
        debriefer will make them at this time. The MCE debriefer will then notify the LRE
        debrief section via phone or e-mail to review Skynet database maintenance log and
        ensure checklists for each in-flight discrepancy were received. If no Skynet database
        maintenance log entries have been made by the aircrew during flight or at final
        debrief, the MCE debriefer will make a Skynet database maintenance log entry to
        include ZULU date/time, aircraft tail number, ID number of GCS used to control the
        aircraft and narrative stating “No defects Noted during flight segment.” The MCE
        debriefer will then notify the LRE debrief section via phone to review Skynet
        database maintenance log. The MCE debriefer will keep a log of all contacts made
        with the LRE debrief section after every debrief. Log entries will include as a
        minimum ZULU date/time of phone call, rank/name of person contacted, and whether
        they acknowledged the aircraft discrepancy. If contact is made by e-mail, the e-mail
        address of the person contacted will be entered. During SIPRNET communication
        outage conditions, the CONUS and OCONUS debrief sections will use IMDS screen
        837 Log Book to communicate aircraft discrepancies. As a minimum the following
        information will be included: ZULU debrief date/time, aircraft tail number, ID
        number of GCS used to control the aircraft, code of discrepancy, description of
        discrepancy, first name initial and last name of MCE debriefer, and first name initial
        and last name of MCE PIC or sensor operator who provided the aircraft debrief
        information. MCE debriefer will return GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms binder
        with aircraft AFTO Form 781A including newly debriefed aircraft discrepancies to
        the respective GCS after aircrew changeover or Ku-to-Ku handover debrief.
        4.7.12.1.5. Multiple Aircraft Control (MAC) GCS Sensor Operator - Perform
        applicable aircraft and MAC GCS station face-to-face debrief with MCE debriefer
        after aircrew changeover, Ku-to-Ku handover, or final aircraft handback to LRE.

   5.8.1. Managers prioritize work to meet current and projected mission needs. MICAP parts
   receive priority repair (P1), Readiness Spares package (RSP) requirements are considered
   next and are prioritized by their demand rates and stock levels (P2). Peacetime operating
   stock restock items are normally worked as priority three (P3), prioritized by the demand
   rates and item stock levels. All other items will be considered priority four (P4).
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        85


   5.8.2. Two-Level Maintenance (2LM). 2LM restricts the level of repair authorized for
   avionics line replaceable units (LRUs). The following guidelines apply to organizations
   operating under 2LM. Refer to AFI 21-129 for further guidance.
      5.8.2.1. Avionics sections are authorized to perform the following maintenance actions if
      the required support equipment is authorized and on-hand. Repairs above and beyond
      those listed require approval from the appropriate approval authority (e.g., Lead
      Command, depot). 2LM flights will limit repairs to:
          5.8.2.1.1. CND or bench check serviceable (BCS) screening.
          5.8.2.1.2. TCTOs performed at wing level.
          5.8.2.1.3. LRU operational flight program (OFP) loads.
          5.8.2.1.4. Shop-replaceable units (SRU) cross-CANNs.
          5.8.2.1.5. Replacement of minor bits and pieces.
          5.8.2.1.6. High priority TCTOs or other circumstances may result in more workload
          than can be accommodated under 2LM. In the event the section cannot accomplish
          the special workload as well as normal CND/BCS screening, the following formula
          may be used to identify those 2LM LRUs that could be temporarily “direct Not
          Repairable This Station (NRTS)” without screening. The formula may also help
          determine LRU priorities in order to adjust workload to meet production. Index
          formula: Index Number = Percent of Base Repair (PBR) * EXCHG PRICE * Daily
          Demand Rate (DDR).
              5.8.2.1.6.1. LRUs with higher index numbers have a higher priority for repair
              compared to those with lower numbers. In the example below, the PSP would
              have the highest priority, followed by DMT. DFLCC may be a candidate to
              temporarily “Direct NRTS” until workload permits CND/BCS screening.

Figure 5.1. Example Index Numbers.
NOUN                            PBR*      EXCHG PRICE* DDR              = INDEX
PSP                             63        $33352.00  214412             450517348512
DMT                             13        $16521.00  21451              4607095623

   5.8.3. Historical Records. Section NCOICs maintain AFTO IMTs 95 on selected,
   significantly repairable, serialized components for which historical failure data would
   enhance repair. Historical records are mandatory for SPRAM LRUs, and items asterisked in
   weapons system Dash-6 manuals. Historical records will be maintained IAW TO 00-20-1.
      5.8.3.1. The record remains with the component anytime it is undergoing maintenance.
      5.8.3.2. Data is provided from these records, upon request, to the analysis function to aid
      in defining avionics maintenance problems and recommended solutions.
   5.8.4. Avionics Flights supporting 2LM, multiple MDS, and those organized under the
   combat support team structure are authorized to form functional sections below flight level to
86                                                AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013

6.1. General. The MOS is directly responsible to the MXG/CC for the administration, analysis,
training management, and programs and resources necessary to support the group production
effort. The MOS is comprised of the following flights, Maintenance Operations, Maintenance
Training, and Programs and Resources. The planning, controlling, scheduling, and executing
responsibilities of the MXG/CC will be met through the actions of these functions.
6.2. Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF). The flight is comprised of the following
sections: Maintenance Operations Center; Engine Management; Maintenance Data Systems
Analysis; Plans, Scheduling and Documentation; and Maintenance Supply Liaison (assigned to
LRS but may physically reside in Maintenance). This flight is the central agency for monitoring
and developing long-range strategies to sustain the health of the fleet. Fleet management is
defined as the effective utilization of available resources to accomplish the aircraft support cycle
from planned maintenance events to flying schedule execution. It is a disciplined and prioritized
scheduling effort that optimizes support to aircraft requirements such as flying events, ground
training events, scheduled maintenance inspections, aircraft configuration control, aircraft
modification schedules and aircraft recovery maintenance. Effective fleet management results in
consistent availability of quality aircraft to meet operational requirements. The MOF
superintendent position will be filled by senior NCO 2RXXX personnel, if available. (N/A to the
ARC.)
   6.2.1. MOF/CC/Chief (MOF/SUPT). In addition to general responsibilities in Chapter 3
   will:
       6.2.1.1. Develop and publish the wing flying/maintenance schedule in coordination with
       other squadrons and submit to both the OG and MXG/CC for approval.

        of the DIT include: (1) Ensuring the unit has complete and accurate data in the MIS
        and aircraft forms, (2) identifying and quantifying problems within the unit
        preventing complete and accurate documentation, and (3) identifying and correcting
        the root causes for poor data integrity. The DIT is established to
        evaluate/isolate/eliminate documentation problems in IMDS-CDB/G081. MMA is the
        OPR for the team, but is not responsible for correcting errors. The DIT will include,
        at a minimum, one representative from each squadron under the MXG. It will include
        participation from PS&D, MOC, MSL/LRS, EM, Debrief Section, and QA as
        determined by MMA. Lead Command will determine the frequency of DIT meetings.
        Representatives will be at least 5-levels and familiar with the unit’s assigned weapon
        system(s). As a minimum, the following weekly functions will be performed by the
        DIT:

           minimum of one aircraft per flying squadron, per week will be checked. Rotate
           selected tail numbers to ensure of all aircraft’s forms are reviewed at least once
           each year. For the selected aircraft, 100% of the previous weeks IMT-AFTO form
           781As will be reviewed against MIS. When the two differ, the responsible work
           center will be charged with an error and have it included in the error rate. Records
           checks do not cover this requirement.
           6.2.6.16.6.2. Compare all NRTS actions and turnarounds in IMDS-CDB/G081
           with those in the ILS-S to ensure they match. G081 users will request these
           reports from LRS. Work with supply to resolve conflicts.
           6.2.6.16.6.3. Run maintenance action review background reports for all work
           accomplished by squadron and work center.
               6.2.6.16.6.3.1. Audit the report by JCN/WCE to verify the corrective action
               narratives match the action taken codes used and the WUC utilized most
               accurately identifies the affected system.
               6.2.6.16.6.3.2. Identify suspected errors on the report by circling or marking
               on the report and give report to appropriate squadron for corrections. Identify
               and count the documentation errors. Use of automated processes is authorized.
           6.2.6.16.6.4. Develop a system to track the number of errors by work center and
           squadron.
           6.2.6.16.6.5. Establish a 5 day suspense to correct errors and report back to the
           DIT.
           6.2.6.16.6.6. Maintain cumulative uncorrected and corrected error rate databases.
           Analyze the error rate data and prepare reports of rates and identify where errors
           are occurring. Error rates and causes will be briefed to the MXG/CC monthly.
           6.2.6.16.6.7. Do not limit the scope of DIT to JDD.

       6.2.6.17. Analysis Functions. Analysts will use the following processes when analyzing
       maintenance data:
           6.2.6.17.1. Production analysis.       The production analysis function calculates
           maintenance metrics and compares unit performance against published Lead
           Command standards. In addition, they provide monthly airframe, facility and
           personnel capabilities (as required), attrition, and spare factors for use in planning the
           annual flying program. Compute attrition and spare factors IAW Lead Command
           instructions.
           6.2.6.17.2. Deficiency Analysis: Lead Commands will determine requirements for
           deficiency analysis. Deficiency analysts serve a dual role; they provide analytical
           support to the squadrons and maintenance managers, and also provide technical
           expertise for the MMA section.
   6.2.7. Responsibilities of Contingency/Expeditionary units (i. e. maintaining non-
   assigned aircraft). NOTE: this does not include AMC established en-route stations.
       6.2.7.1. Ensuring Fleet Health is largely the responsibility of units with assigned aircraft.
       Contingency units have fewer responsibilities as described below. Commanders of
       expeditionary units will ensure the intent of the guidance is met, when dynamic nature of
       a contingency/expeditionary organizations make adherence possible.
       6.2.7.2. Implement all MOC programs and duties as described in paragraph 6.2 and sub
       paragraphs.
       6.2.7.3. Implement a PS&D program IAW Chapter 7.
       6.2.7.4. Implement deficiency analysis program for deployed (gained/CHOPed) aircraft.
       Emphasis should be on ensuring accurate MIS documentation and analyzing maintenance
       metrics for trends (as opposed to meeting standards).
       6.2.7.5. DBM and MIS management will be provided by reachback to homestation units.
       6.2.7.6. Deployed analysts, where required, will coordinate access to the IMDS-CDB
       ELC with response to an access request memo generated from the requesting
       member/organization. Ensure that the requesting members have a current IMDS-CDB
       user-id loaded in the MIS. The access request memo must explicitly define an expiration
       date that is limited to the length of TDY/deployment or till access is no longer needed,
       whichever comes first.
       6.2.7.7. IMDS-CDB ELC Host DBM, where applicable, will maintain a listing of outside
       ELC users; update, add, change or remove ELC guest users upon access expiration date,
       re-assignment, separation, or retirement.
6.3. Maintenance Training Flight (MTF). (N/A to ARC) MTF will: Provide initial, recurring
and advanced proficiency, qualification, or certification training needed by a technician to
perform duties in their primary AFSC. Serve as the single point of contact for all training matters
affecting maintenance, including outside agencies such as emergency management,
environmental flight and the Training Detachment (TD). The MTF consists of the Training
management section and the development and instructor section. The MTF assists SQ/CCs by
providing Unit Training Managers (UTM) to manage the enlisted specialty training program.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        129


The MTF Chief maintains administrative responsibility for UTMs whether UTMs are centralized
or decentralized.
   6.3.1. Organizations that do not have a MTF must complete skill training in the individual
   work centers.
   6.3.2. Maintenance training is an essential element of improving and sustaining unit
   capability; it must receive priority treatment by SQ/CC and MOO/MX SUPT. When
   balancing resources (e.g., aircraft, support equipment, facilities, tools, funding, personnel),
   maintenance training carries an equal priority with the operational training mission.
   Accomplish maintenance training away from the production/test environment (whenever
   possible) to eliminate/minimize distractions.
   6.3.3. Training requirements may be satisfied through AETC in-resident classes, TD, MTF,
   Mobile Training Team (MTT), AF Institute of Technology (AFIT), CDC, AFETS, civilian
   institutions, Computer Based Training (CBT), Video Tele-Training (VTT), Regional
   Training Centers (RTC), Maintenance Qualification Centers (MQC), Advanced Distributed
   Learning Service (ADLS), the Environmental, Safety, and Health Training Network
   (ESOHTN),or any combination thereof.
       6.3.3.1. AETC TDs will be utilized as the primary maintenance training resource at all
       bases with an assigned TD. The TD will not be responsible to conduct ancillary training.
       The MTF will develop courses and supplement training when the training requirements
       are beyond the capability and timely response of the TD. The MTF will not duplicate
       training provided by the TD.
   6.3.4. For maintenance training policy and guidance, refer to AFI 36-2232 and Lead
   Command directives. Civil service and contract organizations shall perform training IAW
   their training plans as accepted by the government, their respective performance work
   statement (PWS) and Lead Command directives.
   6.3.5. Upgrade training waivers will be completed IAW AFECD and AFI 36-2101.
   6.3.6. Coordinate training course control documents (CCD) for explosive safety training
   through the wing weapons safety office annually.
   6.3.7. Ensure all maintenance personnel (AFSC 2A7X3/2A7X5 personnel are exempt)
   receive annual Corrosion Prevention and Control training. CBT training is available and is
   the preferred method. Additionally, annual training will include specific excerpts in regard
   to local/unique corrosion factors.
6.4. Programs and Resources Flight. Manages the manning, facilities, support agreements,
and deployment functions for the MXG.
   6.4.1. Develops, maintains, and coordinates all applicable AFI-directed programs and plans
   affecting maintenance.
   6.4.2. Acts as the resource advisor to MXG/CC.
   6.4.3. Conducts staff assistance visits (SAVs) within the MXG to assist each maintenance
   functional area.
       6.4.3.1. Administratively evaluate a unit’s ability to deploy IAW the DOC statement.

      6.4.3.2. Conduct and document SAVs at least annually. Units will retain documentation
      until the next SAV unless repeat discrepancies are Noted. If discrepancies are repeated,
      SAV documentation will be retained until the discrepancies are closed.
  6.4.4. Manages manpower authorizations for the MXG.
  6.4.5. Serves as the focal point within the MXG for management of facilities.
  6.4.6. Serves as the focal point for MXG deployment planning and execution actions. If
  designated as a UTC Pilot Unit:
      6.4.6.1. Coordinates with other UTC tasked units on cargo and equipment
      authorizations/requirements to develop and maintain a standardized package to meet
      specific mission capability requirements.
      6.4.6.2. Coordinates with the AS monitor on equipment changes and new equipment

                                           Chapter 7

      MAINTENANCE PLANS, SCHEDULING AND DOCUMENTATION (PS&D)

7.1. General. Maintenance documentation maintains historical documents and maintenance
data essential for the development of wing plans and schedules and is an integral part of all
PS&D functions. PS&D sections maintain historical maintenance data within the MIS. The
accuracy of maintenance document entries is a basic responsibility of the initiator and
supervisors. PS&D sections develop wing maintenance plans using MIS aircraft historical data
input by all maintenance personnel. Maintenance schedulers are centralized (physically) in the
MOF PS&D section. EXCEPTION: Engine Management, Nuclear Munitions, AFSOC units
will be centrally managed with decentralized execution. Units publish written guidance in an
OI/supplement to ensure standardized core scheduling practices across the wing to include:
   7.1.1. Automated and AFTO IMT 95 documentation requirements.
   7.1.2. Standardized aircraft jacket files. Develop and maintain a standardized master aircraft
   jacket file for use throughout the wing. Wing assigned aircraft jacket files must mirror the
   standard in organization and appearance. Slight variations in composition are allowed
   between different MDSs.
   7.1.3. Missing IMTs policy requirements and annual jacket file review checklists.
   7.1.4. Pre-dock and post-dock inspection meeting guidance to supplement this chapter and
   identify minimum required attendees. PS&D will attend meetings and notify the appropriate
   SQ/CC and flight supervisors of any recurring problems.
   7.1.5. Inspection requirements for historical documents at all decentralized scheduling
   activities IAW this chapter and Lead Command guidance.
   7.1.6. Management of the wing’s SI, TCI, TCTO and Aircraft Configuration Management
   (ACM) programs IAW this chapter and Lead Command guidance. Assign specific
   responsibilities for each work center involved (e.g., egress, aircrew AFE, and PS&D) and
   establish procedures to ensure configuration data is maintained during routine maintenance
   actions. TCI and TCTO procedures must outline the requirements for ordering hazardous
   materials (e.g., batteries). Units using MIS will not delegate suspense validation processing
   for TCIs installed on aircraft to the performing work center unless the written procedures
   include: a list of work centers and specific technicians authorized to process suspenses, a list
   of the specific suspenses authorized to be cleared and the method for notifying PS&D of the
   work completed (an audit trail). EM will process all MIS suspense validations for engines
   and engine components.
   7.1.7. Common formats for TCTO folders and monthly/weekly utilization and maintenance
   schedules across the wing. Folders and schedules will be standardized among the same MDS,
   but may vary slightly between MDSs.
   7.1.8. Freezing and consolidating aircraft and equipment records in the event of an accident,
   mishap or impoundment.
   7.1.9. Aircraft and equipment transfer inspections IAW this chapter.
 132                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   7.1.10. Accomplishment of an Aircraft Documents Review (ADR) checklist for home
   station and deployed units. This checklist will identify who initiates the ADR, reviewing
   agencies (to include the OAP lab), AFTO Form/IMT 781 entry requirements, agency
   responsible for completing the AFTO Form/IMT 781/MIS entry, and outline any
   configuration verification requirements.
       7.1.10.1. Maintenance personnel will correct all documentation discrepancies discovered
       during the ADR, prior to updating the ADR JCN.
   7.1.11. Verifying configuration items during aircraft phases.
   7.1.12. Procedures to update manual products in the event Maintenance Scheduling
   Application Tool (MSAT) and/or the MIS are not available for an extended period of time
   (more than 48 hours). Paper MIS products are not required when using MSAT (IMDS users
   only) or the most current AF standardized Aircraft Maintenance Scheduling Mission Support
   Application to facilitate the management of MIS data. The back-up plan will ensure access to
   the most current paper or electronic version of MIS products used in MSAT. The MSAT
   administrator will be assigned to PS&D.
7.2. Manage the following programs for assigned aircraft and equipment using the
following guidelines:
   7.2.1. Aircraft Document Reviews. ADRs validate and correct any errors on airframe and
   engine operating times and cycles, TCTO documentation, TCI component operating times,
   time remaining to the next inspection, backordered supply document numbers and open and
   deferred discrepancies. Aircraft AFTO Form/IMT 781-series for possessed aircraft, are
   reviewed by flightline maintenance functions (DCC or alternate), PS&D, EM and supply to
   ensure the accuracy and validity of entries.
       7.2.1.1. The MIS background product “Automated Records Check (ARC)” or on-line
       MIS products may be used to perform the ADR, however, ensure use of MIS products is
       standardized for all assigned units. Units using MDS specific MIS systems (i.e. IMIS)
       must develop procedures to ensure implement the intent of Aircraft Document Review.
       7.2.1.2. An ADR is accomplished at least every 60 days for units using fully automated
       AFTO 781-series (AFTO FORMs 781A, 781J, 781K, and 95 generated by the MIS will
       constitute fully automated series). Units without access to a MIS and authorized to use
       manual AFTO 781-series IMTs, must accomplish an ADR at least every 30 days. Also
       accomplish an ADR when an aircraft is transferred (including Queen Bee), deployed for
       more than 30 days, before and after scheduled inspections (PH or ISO), before and after
       storage and after fatigue tests. For CANN aircraft, conduct ADRs at least every 30 days.
       7.2.1.3. ADR Procedures:
          7.2.1.3.1. PS&D creates a JST for ADRs and ensures it is loaded against all assigned
          aircraft.
          7.2.1.3.2. Schedule the ADR in maintenance plans. An ADR is a scheduled
          maintenance action and counts in MSE computations.
          7.2.1.3.3. PS&D and EM validate applicable inspection, TCI, TCTO data for correct
          due dates or expiration dates, airframe and engine operating times (or flight times if
          applicable) and appropriate symbol entry IAW TO 00-20-1.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                           133


         7.2.1.3.4. AMU/AMXS supply runs a tail number inquiry to validate backorders and
         corrects any discrepancies discovered.
  7.2.2. Pre-Dock Meetings. PS&D will review planned aircraft inspection schedules and
  initiate an AF IMT 2410, Inspection/TCTO Planning Checklist, or locally developed product
  for each aircraft prior to the pre-inspection meeting. Lead Commands may determine if the
  pre-/post dock requirement for inspections with less than a 200 hourly or 200 calendar day
  cycle is required. If it is determined that a pre-/post dock meeting is not required, initiation of
  an AF IMT 2410 is not necessary. PS&D personnel will:
     7.2.2.1. Prior to the pre-dock meeting
         7.2.2.1.1. Review and list all known aircraft and equipment TCTO, TCI, SI and other
         major requirements to be accomplished during the inspection on the AF IMT 2410, or
         locally developed product
         7.2.2.1.2. Identify requirements for kits or parts
         7.2.2.1.3. List all DDs to be accomplished during the inspection on the AF IMT 2410
         keeping the original JCNs.
         7.2.2.1.4. Incorporate all requirements against the aircraft into a work package.
         7.2.2.1.5. List the agencies required to attend the meeting and any discussion items to
         be presented in Block 14.
         7.2.2.1.6. List specialist tasks required in addition to normal inspection needs in
         Block 15.
         7.2.2.1.7. Develop a list of items identified as out-of-configuration for
         verification/correction during the inspection. PS&D will request IMDS DBM process
         screen 942, Actual Configuration Set-up, using the ID number of the aircraft. Once
         accomplished, PS&D must run an IMDS screen 990. For G081 users, view screen
         8110. For non-configuration tracked aircraft, compile a list of missing serially
         controlled items and coordinate/forward them to dock chief for verification.
     7.2.2.2. At the pre-dock meeting, inform representatives of the inspection schedule and
     scope, including TCTOs, TCIs, SIs, DDs and special requirements to be accomplished.
     Agency representatives inform PS&D of limiting factors that might affect the schedule.
     Discuss aircraft configuration during all aircraft pre-dock meetings. Provide a copy of the
     IMDS screen 990 or G081 screen 8110 to the Dock NCOIC in the pre-dock package for
     verification/correction. The responsible work center will correct verified erroneous data
     and out-of-configuration items in IMDS prior to the post-dock meeting. Use the AF IMT
     2410, or locally developed AF IMT 2410 to record additional information discussed
     during the pre-dock meeting. Maintain the original AF IMT 2410, or locally developed
     AF IMT 2410 on file in the aircraft jacket file for use as a guide when conducting the
     post-dock meeting. Give a copy to the dock NCOIC or equivalent.
  7.2.3. Post-Dock Meetings. PS&D will hold a post-dock for all inspections that required a
  pre-dock meeting. At the meeting, the Dock NCOIC, PS&D, Production Superintendent or
  designated representative, Aircraft Section representative and other attendees (DCC, ADCC,
  etc) discuss open discrepancies, review any significant inspection events and identify any
  problems that may adversely affect future scheduling. PS&D will request the DBM to
134                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


  process screen 942 or a new screen 990 for the same aircraft and bring that product to the
  post dock to review/verify corrections with annotated IMDS 990 given to the Dock NCOIC
  at the pre-dock (screen 8110 for G081 users). The Dock NCOIC gives the completed
  inspection work package to PS&D for filing until it is replaced by the next similar inspection
  work package. (For example, an HPO1 will be replaced by the next HPO1 and the HPO2 will
  be replaced with the next HPO2, etc…, and the completed/verified copies of the output
  product (screen 942 or 990) must be maintained in PS&D until the next scheduled PH/ISO
  inspection for that aircraft. PS&D files a computer-printed listing of completed on-line work
  orders in the aircraft jacket file.
  7.2.4. Aircraft Configuration Management. ACM provides unit managers the capability to
  determine the actual versus approved configuration of an aircraft. The intent of configuration
  management is to ensure selected serially controlled and/or TCIs are properly loaded to the
  MIS database. Of major concern are accurate, approved part numbers, quantity per assembly
  (QPA) and next higher assembly (NHA) items by WUC/LCN. PS&D has overall
  responsibility for the ACM subsystem of the MIS and will provide assistance to maintenance
  personnel. The performing work center supervisor and PS&D must conduct supervisory
  reviews of configuration change, TCTO, SI and TCI events using MIS on-line capabilities.
  Individual work centers accomplishing TCIs are responsible for changing configuration
  information in MIS. Unless otherwise specified in local procedures, schedulers must process
  IMDS screen 128 for all removal, installation, TCI, SI and TCTO compliance updates for
  any items installed on the aircraft. EM must process IMDS screen 128 for engines and engine
  components
      7.2.4.1. The configuration tables (F-15s, F-16s, F-22As, CV22B, B-1s and B-2s) are
      electronically pushed to each unit from REMIS as aircraft configuration changes occur.
      Items not accessed or visible during routine field-level maintenance should be identified
      to Lead Command and ALC managers for removal from the configuration management
      table.
      7.2.4.2. Maintenance personnel discovering an item with a missing data plate, or one
      which does not have a serial number, will contact the Lead Command system functional
      manager and ALC item manager for disposition.
      7.2.4.3. For those aircraft that do not currently have an established configuration table,
      use IMDS screen 810 to validate the installed items against the data in the MIS.
      7.2.4.4. PS&D will coordinate the daily resolution of configuration management notices
      utilizing screen 690 or applicable MIS screen. Discrepancies must be briefed at the daily
      production/scheduling meeting and forwarded to the appropriate maintenance section for
      corrective action.
      7.2.4.5. When out of configuration items or missing serially tracked items are
      discovered, establish a single DD for out-of-configuration condition. Add an IMDS WCE
      for each WUC/LCN and part/serial number item requiring verification to that single DD.
  7.2.5. Major Maintenance Work Processing. PS&D will:
      7.2.5.1. Coordinate on all TO 00-25-107 requests for AFI 21-103 reporting. The work
      center discovering the discrepancy is responsible for drafting the TO 00-25-107 request
      and forwarding the request to QA for coordination and release. PS&D is responsible for
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      135


     making the appropriate possession code changes in MIS when AFI 21-103 messages have
     been released. Depot level assistance provided by contractor support is accomplished
     IAW contract specifications.
     7.2.5.2. In conjunction with QA, develop procedures for routing all major maintenance
     requests to ensure all affected parties are informed.
     7.2.5.3. Upon arrival of the DFT, PS&D will conduct an initial meeting to validate
     maintenance support requirements are in place. Meetings will be documented on an AF
     IMT 2410, or locally developed product.
     7.2.5.4. Once work is completed, PS&D will ensure appropriate possession codes are
     changed and a completed copy of the work package is placed in the aircraft historical file.
     Document significant historical data on the appropriate AFTO IMT 95 IAW 00-20 series
     TOs.
  7.2.6. TCTO Management. PS&D administers and manages the overall wing TCTO
  program. TCTOs and AF, Lead Command or NAF-directed modifications and inspections
  provide units with instructions for doing a one-time change, modification, or inspection of
  equipment, (includes applicable FAA air worthiness directives, original equipment
  manufacturer service bulletins and service instructions, after concurrence by Lead
  Command). Use the MIS to process Lead Command and NAF OTIs or modifications in the
  same manner as TCTOs with compliance periods, remove from service dates and rescission
  dates IAW TO 00-5-15. Lead Command, NAF and local inspections are referred to as OTIs.
  TCTOs, with the exception of immediate and urgent action, are considered scheduled
  maintenance and integrated into maintenance planning cycles. Consider concurrent
  accomplishment of TCTO work with other scheduled or unscheduled maintenance (e.g., PH,
  ISO, HSC, HPO). Manage TCTOs using the MIS, TO 00-5-15 and specific Lead Command
  instructions.
     7.2.6.1. General Management of TCTOs. PS&D manages aircraft, AGE and commodity
     TCTOs. Munitions scheduling manages munitions-related TCTOs, and EM manages
     engine-related TCTOs. Armament and PMEL TCTOs will be managed by the owning
     agency however; PS&D still has the overall responsibility to monitor the effective
     management of the entire wing TCTO program. The parent technical training center
     manages and schedules all TCTOs for training equipment assigned to a TD or MTT.
         7.2.6.1.1. PS&D reviews MIS products weekly to ensure proper documentation and
         management by owning and managing TCTO agencies. When an error is detected,
         PS&D advises affected work centers and provides assistance when necessary to
         correct the discrepancy. IAW TO 00-20-2, annual TCTO status reviews will be
         accomplished. [ANNUAL TCTO RECONCILIATION] All units will reconcile
         rescinded TCTO using a REMIS Master TCTO report annually (NLT 30 Sep) and
         before deleting TCTO records from IMDS/G081. If REMIS access is not available,
         request a REMIS Master TCTO report from the POC identified in the subject TCTO..
         If TCTO status conflicts are identified, contact Production Management
         (schedulers/monitors) for status correction in REMIS. Once all status errors are
         corrected, field level organizations can delete the TCTO from IMDS/G081.

         7.2.6.1.2. Significant problems or potential delays in TCTO accomplishment will be
         brought to the immediate attention of the SQ/CC and MXG/CC. PS&D will brief the
         MXG/CC weekly on unaccomplished TCTOs that are within 60 days of grounding.
         7.2.6.1.3. PS&D will chair a TCTO review meeting attended by all TCTO owning
         and managing agencies after the monthly supply TCTO reconciliation meeting. These
         meetings may be combined. PS&D will discuss the supply reconciliation, supply
         status, scheduling factors, current TCTO status and anticipated problems for all active
         TCTOs. PS&D will produce minutes from the meeting and distribute to all affected
         agencies.
         7.2.6.1.4. Depot-level TCTOs, excluding commodities, are loaded and tracked in the
         MIS for auditing compliance and applicability. Depot-level engine TCTOs are loaded
         in CEMS only. Units shall ensure dual reporting of completed depot TCTOs is
         prevented. All field-level companion TCTOs for commodities must be loaded in the
         MIS.
         7.2.6.1.5. The reprogramming of passive/active ECM equipment is administered as a
         commodity TCTO for configuration management purposes. PS&D will coordinate
         with the operations electronic combat pilot/EWO before implementing any CPIN
         changes.
         7.2.6.1.6. When TCTOs are directed for items without serial numbers, assign
         permanent serial numbers IAW TO 00-20-2. If it is not feasible or impractical to
         assign a serial number (e.g., air chucks and pilot clipboards), use bulk quantity
         numbers. For example, if there are 50 air chucks, use serial numbers 1 through 50 in
         the MIS.
         7.2.6.1.7. Control and Transfer of TCTO Kits. Transfer aircraft or equipment, with
         any TCTOs still pending completion, with their applicable TCTO kits. Retain engine
         TCTO kits for engines installed on aircraft at depot locations if the aircraft is
         returning to that unit for TCTO compliance. Transfer TCTO kits IAW AFMAN 23-
         110, TO 00-5-15 and TO 00-5-1.
      7.2.6.2. Specific TCTO Responsibilities.

           7.2.6.2.2.1. Determine the total number of end items applicable to the TCTO.
           Items that are assigned with the same Mission Design Series, WUC, Part Number,
           etc., but are not applicable to the TCTO will be loaded in "22" status. This will
           ensure accurate accountability that all equipment has been verified as being
           affected or not applicable to TCTO.
           7.2.6.2.2.2. Chair a TCTO planning meeting with attendees from QA, owning
           and performing work centers and FSC/LRS (IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2,
           Part 2, Chapter 21). Minutes of this meeting will be recorded on AF IMT 2410, or
           locally-developed product and provide an overall plan to implement the TCTO.
           Minutes will include TCTO applicability by ID number (or applicable part
           number or serial number for commodity TCTOs), purpose of the inspection or
           modification, performing work centers, training requirements, scheduling
           parameters, remove from service date, a review of the TCTO procedures, IMT
           entries and any supply requirements identified before the TCTO can be scheduled
           for accomplishment. All attendees sign the AF IMT 2410, or locally developed
           product at the conclusion of the planning meeting indicating agreement with the
           conditions.
           7.2.6.2.2.3. Establish and maintain a TCTO folder for each active TCTO. The
           folder will include the basic TCTO and any supplements, completed AF IMT
           2410, or locally developed product, AF IMT 2001, Notification of TCTO Kit
           Requirements (if required), messages and the supply cover memorandum from
           QA. Once the TCTO has reached its rescission date, print a MIS product showing
           the current status of equipment and place it in the TCTO folder. Move the folder
           to an inactive TCTO file. The TCTO managing agency will maintain the folder
           until the TCTO is rescinded in the applicable TO index, MIS TCTO records will
           be deleted at that time. TCTOs will not be deleted from the MIS prior to the
           rescission date.
           7.2.6.2.2.4. If an initial TCTO load is not received from REMIS, notify the ALC
           to attempt a second REMIS push. If a second attempt is not successful, load the
           TCTO into the MIS. Lead Command will load TCTOs for G081 users.
           7.2.6.2.2.5. Use the ILS-S to order required kits/parts/tools IAW MIS manuals.
           When ILS-S is not available, initiate three copies of the AF IMT 2001. Forward
           two copies of the IMT with a copy of the TCTO to the supply TCTO monitor. For
           locally obtained parts, prepare an AF IMT 2001 listing each item by NSN, noun
           and quantity required. Assign ID numbers to kits as they are received. Use Part II
           of the AF IMT 2001 to manage kit/part assignment and track individual end
           items, date issued, document numbers and the number of kits remaining. The
           supply TCTO monitor will ensure kits and/or parts are assembled prior to release.
           The performing work center will order/maintain all HAZMAT required to comply
           with TCTOs and provide document numbers to the TCTO managing agency and
           supply TCTO monitor.
           7.2.6.2.2.6. Control and release TCTO kits from LRS.
           7.2.6.2.2.7. Notify appropriate Lead Command and NAF functional managers, by
           message, when local managers anticipate a problem with TCTO compliance
138                                       AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


         within prescribed time limits. The message should include the TCTO number and
         narrative, total units affected, total units complete, kits on hand, kits on order,
         estimated delivery date, requisition number and a narrative of the problem.
         7.2.6.2.2.8. Report status of TCTOs that cannot be reported under “HOW MAL”
         codes 793, 797, 798, 801, 802, or 911 IAW the MIS, and 00-20 series TOs.
         7.2.6.2.2.9. Report interim TCTO status on immediate, urgent or routine action
         safety TCTOs as directed by Lead Command.
         7.2.6.2.2.10. Schedule, track and monitor TCTO accomplishment. Prepare a work
         order in the MIS for each affected end-item, including spares. Agencies owning
         installed on-equipment TCTOs will coordinate with PS&D prior to scheduling on-
         aircraft TCTOs.
         7.2.6.2.2.11. Review suspense validation inputs prior to processing TCTO
         suspenses and updating the MIS.
         7.2.6.2.2.12. Update equipment/aircraft TCTO status as changes occur.
         7.2.6.2.2.13. Annotate back-up MIS products as changes occur..
         7.2.6.2.2.14. Ensure TCTOs are scheduled for completion prior to expiration or
         grounding date whichever comes first.
         7.2.6.2.2.15. Schedule all workable TCTOs for accomplishment prior to
         permanent equipment transfer or storage input.
      7.2.6.2.3. The Performing Work Center personnel will:
         7.2.6.2.3.1. Report all deficiencies in technical instructions and applicability to
         the TCTO managing agency and QA.
         7.2.6.2.3.2. Attend TCTO planning meetings. Review the TCTO prior to the
         meeting and request clarification of any requirements from QA and the
         appropriate TCTO managing agency during the meeting.
         7.2.6.2.3.3. Inventory TCTO kits for completeness prior to starting work. If a
         discrepancy exists, contact the TCTO managing agency to resolve shortages.
         7.2.6.2.3.4. Perform the inspection or modification procedures outlined in the
         TCTO and document results or findings in the MIS.
         7.2.6.2.3.5. If an inspection TCTO generates a requirement for parts, the
         performing work center creates a new JCN and enters the discrepancy in the
         AFTO Form/IMT 781A or applicable equipment record and orders the required
         parts. Inspection TCTOs are complete when the inspection is finished.
         7.2.6.2.3.6. Order and maintain all HAZMAT required to comply with TCTOs
         and provide document numbers to the TCTO managing agency and supply TCTO
         monitor.
         7.2.6.2.3.7. Validate technical instructions and data on AFTO IMT 82,

AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     139


  7.2.7. TCIs. PS&D has over-arching responsibility for the wing TCI program. Schedulers
  identify, monitor, forecast and schedule only those selected items specifically identified in
  TO 00-20-9, Forecasting Replacement Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly Time
  Change Items; applicable commodity TOs; the aircraft Dash-6 TO, AFI 21-201 or identified
  as FSG 13 and Materiel Management Code AQ Items.
     7.2.7.1. PS&D personnel will:
         7.2.7.1.1. Establish a JST for both the DOM and DOI for Cartridge-Actuated Devices
         (CAD), Propellant Actuated Devices (PAD), life sustaining, and other TCI items
         listed in the aircraft Dash-6 TO and applicable commodity TOs.
         7.2.7.1.2. Load only the DOI or DOM JST, that comes due first, in the MIS against a
         specific part or serial number. As a minimum, when the DOI and DOM frequencies
         are identical, maintain the JST for the DOM. (N/A for G081 units)
     7.2.7.2. TCI Forecasting. Forecasting of CAD/PAD items for long-term CAD/PAD spare
     requirements will be accomplished by OO-ALC through use of the Requirements
     Determination Module (RDM) to extract installation and due dates from the REMIS
     aircraft maintenance data collection system. Items not visible in a maintenance data
     system will continue to be forecasted by the using organization IAW TO 00-20-9,
     Forecasting Replacement Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly TCIs.
         7.2.7.2.1. When CAD/PAD items or forecast requirements are not visible within the
         maintenance data system (e.g., CLS managed components), units forecast for TCIs
         IAW TO 00-20-9 and AFI 21-201. In these cases, validate and consolidate TCI
         forecasts for items listed in TO 00-20-9, commodity TOs, and aircraft specific Dash-6
         TOs. Submit consolidated forecasts to the appropriate Lead Command representative
         with an info copy to munitions operations. Forward any quarterly updated forecasts to
         munitions operations.
     7.2.7.3. Initiate, validate, and submit TCI extension requests to the ALC item manager
     (IM) with info copy to munitions operations. Maintain and monitor a suspense copy of
     the extension request and follow up prior to the grounding date of the TCI. Refer to
     Technical Orders 00-20-1 and 00-20-9 for additional guidance on TCI extensions.
     Maintain a copy of the ALC/System Program Director (SPD) approved message until the
     item is replaced.
         7.2.7.3.1. EM section will generate engine TCI extension requests and send requests
         directly to the ALC.
         7.2.7.3.2. Monthly, perform aircraft resynchronization for each aircraft that had TCIs
         accomplished
     7.2.7.4. The IM will either satisfy demand for parts by directing shipment (depot or
     inter-command RDO) of assets or approve TCI extensions as appropriate. IMs are
     authorized to direct inter-command redistribution of CAD/PAD parts as required.
     7.2.7.5. Participate in a monthly reconciliation of all TCIs with FSC. The reconciliation
     will consist of 100 percent validation of existing due-outs and a complete physical
     inventory of all issued TCIs. Inform FSC of any "mark for" changes or items no longer
     required.
140                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      7.2.7.6. Monitor and requisition TCI requirements based on projected equipment
      utilization. Order parts using ILS-S, if available. Unless otherwise specified in Dash-11,
      Dash-14 and Dash-6 TOs. TCIs are considered due for replacement at the HPO, PH, PE,
      HSC or ISO inspection nearest to the replacement date.
         7.2.7.6.1. Notify the Munitions Flight of the need to order munitions items IAW TO
         00-20-9 and AFI 21-201. CAD/PAD TCIs with 9 months or less service life
         remaining may be turned into munitions operations and must not be reissued.
         Maintenance plans must reflect replacement dates to coincide within the 9-month
         parameter.
         7.2.7.6.2. Order non-CAD/PAD or engine TCIs IAW AFMAN 23-110.
      7.2.7.7. Schedule the time change in the MIS and incorporate it in the monthly/weekly
      maintenance plan.
      7.2.7.8. Review the data entered by the performing work center and update the suspense
      validation in the MIS when the time change is completed (N/A to units using G081).
      7.2.7.9. Coordinate management of respective TCIs with egress, and AFE sections.
      7.2.7.10. Schedule drogue chute TCIs, except chute harnesses, for replacement during
      the drogue chute repack before the expiration of the component service or shelf life.
      These components will not be over flown without an approved waiver from the
      appropriate item manager.
      7.2.7.11. Prepare TCI forecasts IAW TO 00-20-9. Provide squadron MOO/SUPTs a
      forecast for non-munitions items for their supply section.
      7.2.7.12. Validate TCI requirements 45-60 days prior to the next quarter with the
      MASO. Validate current requirements against the annual forecast and make corrections
      based on aircraft utilization.
  7.2.8. Aircraft Generation Planning. The AF IMT 2408, Generation Maintenance Plan; AF
  IMT 2409, Generation Sequence Action Schedule, (GSAS); or Lead Command approved
  automated equivalents will be used to manage aircraft generation sequence actions for
  various unit taskings. The AF IMT 2408 reflects the hour sequence of all actions necessary to
  launch aircraft and contains a locally established legend indicating the type aircraft and
  tasked mission. The AF IMT 2409 shows the actions necessary to generate a specific line
  number. Use locally established codes for maintenance shown in the action column blocks
  and to report maintenance actions during generation. The AF IMT 2408 and AF IMT 2409
  are not required for AETC/AFMC units without a mobility tasking. PS&D personnel will:
      7.2.8.1. Develop, coordinate and prepare all aircraft maintenance flow plans in
      conjunction with Maintenance Operations, WWM and MUNS personnel.
      7.2.8.2. Prepare the GSAS in sufficient detail to satisfy all generation actions. A
      completed GSAS requires only the aircraft serial number assignment and the 24-hour
      clock time annotation. Each plan must not exceed unit resources (i.e., load crews,
      equipment, convoys per hour, supervision, etc.).
      7.2.8.3. Forward the completed GSAS IMT to affected activities at the beginning of the
      generation sequence.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      141


     7.2.8.4. Compare GSAS plans semi-annually with the unit DOC statement to ensure
     compatibility with the mission.
     7.2.8.5. Attend post exercise/contingency “hot wash” meetings to evaluate flow plans for
     changes or improvements.
     7.2.8.6. Classification Guidance. If classified data is used to populate the 2408/2409s,
     classify the 2408/2409 IAW the guidance of the originating document (i.e. Warning
     Order, ATO, etc.). In general, using real world/exercise mission numbers, take-off times,
     and tail numbers may lead to conditions where the 2408/2409 contains classified
     information.
  7.2.9. Transfer Inspections. Units perform gaining/losing transfer inspections IAW TO 00-
  20-1, Lead Command guidance and this instruction.
     7.2.9.1. In conjunction with QA, develop a local JST/work package for both gaining and
     losing aircraft and equipment transfer inspection. This JST/work package must meet all
     00-20-1, 2J-1-18, applicable aircraft Dash-6 and Dash-21 TOs, as well as AFI 21-103 and
     Lead Command specific transfer requirements. Include historical records (e.g., NDI
     records, Egress records, W&B records, OAP records, strut records) and other items.
     7.2.9.2. Losing PS&D ensures all actions are completed in the MIS prior to permanently
     transferring an aircraft to another unit.
     7.2.9.3. Losing PS&D conducts a transfer pre-dock meeting one duty day prior to start of
     the aircraft transfer inspection. All items to be accomplished during the transfer
     inspection will be documented on an AF IMT 2410, or locally developed product, and
     scheduled in the MIS.
     7.2.9.4. Losing PS&D completes a total verification of all TCIs installed on the
     transferring aircraft. Verify the correct computation of all due dates/hour/cycles based on
     DOM, DOI, installed times, etc.
     7.2.9.5. For IMDS units only:
         7.2.9.5.1. Ensure the IMDS - REMIS synchronization programs are processed and
         errors are corrected prior to transfer.
         7.2.9.5.2. Ensure an up-to-date Transfer of Equipment (TRE) report and an AFTO
         IMT 95 with current engine trend and performance data are placed in the aircraft
         jacket file. A backup copy will be maintained by the losing unit until receipt is
         verified by gaining unit.
     7.2.9.6. Losing PS&D ensure an ADR is performed and conduct a transfer post dock
     meeting to ensure all required actions have been completed and all forms are
     current/accurate.
  7.2.10. Acceptance Inspections. Units perform acceptance inspections IAW TO 00-20-1,
  Lead Command guidance and this instruction.
  7.2.11. Aircraft Jacket Files.
     7.2.11.1. Establish jacket files for aircraft and maintenance historical documents IAW
     AFMAN 33-363 and TO 00-20-1. Aircraft jacket files will be maintained in PS&D and
142                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      standardized IAW the master aircraft historical file developed by PS&D NCOIC.
      Documents decentralized to sections maintaining installed-on equipment (e.g., fuel cell
      records at fuel systems section, landing gear strut records at hydraulics section) are filed
      by, and the responsibility of, the OWC. PS&D will list all historical records, including
      those decentralized in their file plan or office of record. The DD Form 2861, Cross-
      Reference, will be used to cross-reference documents decentralized from PS&D to other
      sections. PS&D personnel will:
         7.2.11.1.1. Ensure individual documents are kept for end items, subsystems and
         components IAW 00-20 series TOs, this instruction, AFMAN 33-363, AF Records
         Disposition        Schedule         located       at      https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
         af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm and applicable Dash-6 TOs. MIS automated history is
         used in place of AFTO IMT 95 to document significant historical events on aircraft,
         engines, AGE and armament equipment. A copy of a MIS automated history must be
         down loaded (on a CD) annually and be available at all times. Documents for non-
         powered AGE, training equipment and common equipment items requiring very little
         maintenance documentation may be grouped together in a single folder or area to
         eliminate keeping a record folder on each individual item. When this is done,
         documents for similar items should be grouped together and the recorded information
         should be identifiable to particular pieces of equipment.
         7.2.11.1.2. When aircraft are temporarily moved to operating locations away from
         the unit of assignment, send only those documents necessary to ensure safety of flight
         and current aircraft status. Units will develop written procedures for records taken to
         deployed locations based on duration of TDY and peculiar operating requirements.
         When pertinent documents are not sent with the aircraft, accumulated airframe hours,
         TCTO status, TCI status data on installed engines and critical components are sent
         from the operating location to the parent unit as specified by Lead Command
         instructions.
         7.2.11.1.3. Review aircraft jacket files and associated decentralized records annually
         using the PS&D-developed checklist. The last completed checklist must be kept on
         file in each aircraft jacket file.
         7.2.11.1.4. Maintain inactive (pulled) AFTO Form/IMT 781 series IAW AFMAN
         33-363 and dispose of IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule located at
         https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. If forms are missing,
         send a missing form letter to the appropriate section NCOIC with a 5 duty-day
         suspense. If a response is not returned within 5 duty days, notify maintenance
         supervision. If the forms cannot be located, file the missing form letter, endorsed by
         the section NCOIC and maintenance supervision, in the aircraft jacket file in place of
         the missing forms. See TO 00-20-1 for missing form procedures. Units using fully
         automated forms will maintain the last 7 copies of the aircraft forms. When the 8th
         report is received, destroy the earliest record. Units not required to use MIS, will use
         aircraft forms maintaining the current and last 3 month’s worth of closed aircraft
         forms .NOTE: Units that are utilizing laptop forms only (i.e.. Integrated Maintenance
         Information System (IMIS), Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)) do not
         need to maintain 7 sets of 781 forms.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                          143


           7.2.11.1.5. Because PS&D is centralized in MOF, Debrief may maintain the last
           seven pulled sets of 781s from the aircraft forms binder in a consolidated file. The
           debrief records will be inspected quarterly by MOF PS&D to ensure effective control
           and organization. MOF PS&D will annotate in the aircraft jacket file the 781s are in a
           decentralized location and reference file plan location.
7.3. Operations and Maintenance Planning Cycle. Lead Commands shall develop procedures
to ensure the intent of the operational planning cycle is met. The objective of the operational
planning cycle is to execute the wing flying hour program consistent with operational
requirements and maintenance capabilities. The operational planning cycle begins with the
annual allocation of flying hours and UTE rates. Maintenance and operations schedulers will
propose an annual flying plan balancing both operational requirements and maintenance
capabilities. The annual plan, detailed by month, will evaluate the capability of maintenance to
support the annual flying hour program. The plan will be developed, coordinated and
consolidated jointly by Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Current Operations Flight
Scheduling, and PS&D. The printed wing plan will include an assessment of the wing’s ability
to execute the flying hour program. The plan will be coordinated with the OG/CC and MXG CC
before being approved by the WG/CC. Commit the fewest number of aircraft possible to meet
programmed UTE rate standards and goals.
   7.3.1. If applicable, Lead Commands shall develop scheduling procedures for units involved
   in Operational Test and Evaluation, Developmental Test and Evaluation, or Initial
   Operational Test and Evaluation to ensure the intent of the flying and maintenance planning
   cycle is met.
7.4. First Look Requirements. The First Look report is an internal wing document intended to
highlight potential maintenance-capacity and operational-requirement disconnects in the
upcoming year. Every year, on or about 15 March, PS&D will task MMA to provide PS&D with
an airframe capabilities assessment. This assessment will take into account personnel, facilities,
and airfield infrastructure for each aircraft maintenance organization NLT the last workday of
March.
   7.4.1. PS&D will provide copies of the capability study to each OS scheduling section and
   maintenance supervision. PS&D will provide first look maintenance capability projections in
   a monthly format IAW Lead Command procedures. Projections include operational
   requirements, an assessment of maintenance’s ability to support the monthly requirement and
   an overall assessment of the unit’s maintenance capability to meet the annual flying hour
   program. (N/A for MAF units).
   7.4.2. OS and maintenance responses are sent to PS&D and OSS Current Operations Flight
   Scheduling and are consolidated into a comprehensive package that includes a breakdown of
   the following items by OS:
       7.4.2.1. Sortie UTE Rates (N/A to MAF units). Compute UTE rates by month for the
       entire fiscal year for contracted (required) sorties and scheduled sorties using the formula:
       (number of sorties per month) divided by (number of PAI aircraft).
       7.4.2.2. Sorties contracted/scheduled per day (N/A to MAF units). Compute the number
       of sorties required per operations and maintenance (O&M) day to meet the operational
       requirement using the formula: (Number of sorties required) divided by (number of O&M
 144                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       days in a given month). Sorties per day will be computed by month for the entire fiscal
       year.
       7.4.2.3. Monthly scheduled sorties (N/A to MAF units). Compute monthly scheduled
       sortie requirements using the formula: (Number of sorties or hours required) divided by
       (1 minus the attrition factor). EXAMPLE: (1,000 sorties or hours required) divided by (1
       minus 0.15) equals 1,177 sorties or hours to schedule. Remember to round any part to the
       next whole sortie or hour.
       7.4.2.4. Inspection dock capability. Compute the number of PH/ISO inspections to be
       accomplished for each maintenance unit, by month, for the entire fiscal year in order to
       meet operational requirements. Compute dock capability using the formula (number of
       O&M days) divided by (number of PH/ISO days) times (inspection cycle). Inspection
       dock capability is provided at the wing level and provided by the squadron performing
       inspections.
   7.4.3. Once compiled, packages shall be presented to the OG and MXG/CCs before being
   presented to the WG/CC.
7.5. Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle. Lead Commands shall develop procedures to
ensure the objectives of the annual maintenance planning cycle are met. At a minimum, Lead
Command procedures will produce an annual flying and maintenance plan that allocates sorties
and hours into quarters, is approved by the wing commander, and published prior to the
beginning of the fiscal year.
   7.5.1. Flying Hour Allocation. Using the Lead Command Baseline Allocation message,
   PS&D and OS/OSS scheduling provide affected work centers the following planning factors
   NLT 20 August each year, or within 10 working days after receipt of the flying hour
   allocations:
       7.5.1.1. Updated capabilities computed by MMA, provided by PS&D.
       7.5.1.2. Required flying hours and estimated sorties and missions, provided by OSS, in
       monthly increments.
       7.5.1.3. Flying days in each month, provided by OSS.
       7.5.1.4. Aircraft and aircrew alert requirements, provided by OSS.
       7.5.1.5. Known and projected TDY and special mission requirements, provided by OSS.
       7.5.1.6. PDM schedule, provided by PS&D.
       7.5.1.7. Configuration and munitions requirements, provided by OSS.
   7.5.2. NLT 1 September, or within 10 working days after receipt of the planning factors,
   maintenance supervision provides PS&D, SQ/CCs, and OSS operations scheduling the
   following planning factors:
       7.5.2.1. Estimated number of aircraft available by month, taking into consideration
       aircraft required for training.
       7.5.2.2. A projected airframe capability statement.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                          145


       7.5.2.3. Forecasted personnel capability, taking into consideration required annual
       training for maintenance personnel. (Not applicable to contract maintenance
       organizations).
       7.5.2.4. The number of supportable sorties for each month.
       7.5.2.5. An estimated monthly attrition factor (N/A to MAF units) provided by MMA.
       This factor combines operations, weather and materiel (maintenance and supply) factors.
       Maintenance is responsible for adding the attrition factor to operational requirements.
       7.5.2.6. A recommended block scheduling pattern.
       7.5.2.7. A statement of limitations.
7.6. Quarterly Maintenance and Operations Planning. Lead Commands will develop
procedures to ensure the objectives of the Quarterly Planning cycle are met. Quarterly planning
starts with the operational requirement for flying hours, UTE rate, airframe availability, alert and
other related scheduling data. The OS operations officer provides these requirements to
maintenance supervision and PS&D NLT 25 days before the beginning of the quarter.
Maintenance supervision and the OS operations officer discuss these requirements at the
scheduling meeting before the quarter being planned.
   7.6.1. Schedulers ensure quarterly plans are as detailed and accurate as possible. Include
   known special missions, PDM schedules, HHQ commitments and lateral command support
   requirements. All maintenance requirements will be consolidated into a single quarterly plan
   using AF IMT 2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, or computer
   generated form. As a minimum, the quarterly plan shows the current month and the next 2
   months planned sorties and known maintenance requirements. Known maintenance
   requirements include all maintenance events that impact aircraft availability and require
   management attention to ensure proper time distributed index (TDI) flow. Multiple
   maintenance events should be bundled for completion during a single aircraft downtime
   event to the greatest extent possible. The goal is to reduce the number of times per month an
   aircraft is removed from the schedule for scheduled maintenance, thus increasing aircraft
   availability. Requests to change the frequency of Dash-6 requirements to increase bundling
   opportunities will be submitted through the applicable Lead MAJCOM weapon system team
   for consideration and/or resolution. To prevent operational utilization for that day(s) flying
   schedule, the quarterly plans will include, at a minimum, calendar inspections, calendar
   TCIs, TCTOs in workable status, PDM schedules, training aircraft, cannibalization aircraft
   and aircraft ISO/PE/PH inspections. Specific locally developed codes will be used to identify
   each different SI, TCI and TCTO on the AF IMT 2401. Other maintenance requirements,
   such as engine changes, hourly requirements, acceptance/transfer inspections, training
   aircraft and cannibalization aircraft will be posted as they become known or planned. Add
   AME inspections to the quarterly plan if the aircraft is scheduled to stay in that configuration
   to ensure the inspections are included in the monthly and weekly schedules. Revise weekly
   and monthly schedules to meet the quarterly plan objectives while staying within the
   maintenance capability. Use the following priority to determine which objectives to support
   if a lack of resources prevents meeting requirements:
       7.6.1.1. Alert commitments
       7.6.1.2. HHQ directed missions.
 146                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       7.6.1.3. Training.
   7.6.2. The OG/CC and MXG/CC chair a quarterly meeting NLT 14 days before the next
   quarter. OSS Current Operations Flight scheduling compiles, coordinates and briefs the
   unit’s quarterly plan and includes operational requirements, support capability and any
   difficulties expected. Once an approved quarterly plan is established, OSS Current
   Operations Flight Scheduling will forward a copy to OS, AMXS, OG and MXG/CCs along
   with all scheduling agencies. The plan will be posted so it may be viewed by both
   maintenance and operations.
7.7. Monthly Maintenance and Operations Planning. Lead Commands will develop
procedures to ensure the objectives of the monthly planning cycle is met. Forecast and monitor
requirements for the current and next 2 months. Include predictable maintenance factors based
on historical data along with other inputs, such as flow times for maintenance, turnaround times
and parts replacement schedules. Include all known operational events (e.g., exercises,
deployments, surges) to determine maintenance’s capability to meet operational needs. The OS
operations officers and maintenance supervision shall review their applicable portion of the
monthly maintenance plan and weekly schedule prior to submission to PS&D. To optimize
aircraft and munitions support, MXS, AMXS, and OS shall ensure the number of aircraft and/or
munitions configurations are minimized and standardized. The monthly schedule refines the
quarterly plan:
   7.7.1. NLT the first weekly scheduling meeting of the month, the OS operations officer
   provides maintenance supervision and PS&D with the estimated operational needs for the
   following month in as much detail as possible. Include known takeoff times, landing times
   and flying hour windows. NOTE: Landing times are not required if the unit has an
   established and constant average sortie duration.
   7.7.2. NLT the second weekly scheduling meeting of the month, maintenance supervision
   tells the OS operations officer whether requirements can be met or limitations exist. Make
   adjustments to the proposed schedule to satisfy maintenance and operational requirements.
   7.7.3. NLT the third weekly scheduling meeting of the month, formalize next month’s plan
   prior to presenting it to the WG/CC for approval. During the Wing/CC’s monthly meeting,
   OS scheduling outlines past accomplishments, status of flying goals, problems encountered
   and detailed needs for the next month. PS&D outlines projected maintenance capability and
   aircraft/equipment availability. If conflicts arise between operational requirements and
   maintenance capability, present alternatives and limitations. MXG/CC, OG/CC and WG/CC
   decide what portion of the mission to support and to what degree.
   7.7.4. When the WG/CC approves the proposed monthly flying plan, PS&D includes it as a
   portion of the monthly flying and maintenance plan. Monthly plans may be published
   electronically provided local security requirements are met.
   7.7.5. The monthly flying and maintenance plan combines all aspects of aircraft utilization
   and includes:
       7.7.5.1. A detailed monthly operations utilization calendar that specifies total aircraft
       flying hours, total sorties and missions, alert requirements, scheduled sortie or mission
       requirements and daily turn plans for each MDS by squadron, group or wing. Do not
       assign attrition sorties to a specific aircrew/mission for the monthly planning process.

           7.7.5.13.7. Airfield operations.
7.8. Weekly Scheduling. The weekly schedule is the final refinement to the monthly plan and
results in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule. Lead Commands will develop procedures
to ensure the objectives of the weekly scheduling process are met. The OS operations officer and
maintenance supervision will review and coordinate on the proposed weekly flying and
maintenance schedule with OS, AMXS and MXS prior to presenting it to OG and MXG CCs.
The group-approved schedule will be submitted to PS&D for compilation and a complete copy
provided to the WG/CC. At the weekly scheduling meeting, evaluate the past week's
accomplishments (to include flying and MSE) and negotiate/approve refinements to the coming
week's schedule. (The AF IMT 2402, Weekly Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule,
is used to summarize the upcoming week’s schedule.) The AF IMT 2403, Weekly Aircraft
Utilization/Maintenance Schedule; and AF IMT 2436, Weekly/Daily Aircraft Utilization
Schedule; are more finite in the depiction of aircraft utilization and maintenance. The AF IMT
 148                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


2403 and AF Form 2436 may be used together or individually. Electronic versions of the above
IMTs/forms are authorized. Whatever IMTs/forms are used, all requirements will be entered.
Weekly schedules may be published electronically provided local security requirements are met.
   7.8.1. NLT 2 workdays before the weekly scheduling meeting, the OS operations officer
   gives maintenance supervision the following information (as required):
       7.8.1.1. Aircraft takeoff and landing times.
       7.8.1.2. Configuration requirements.
       7.8.1.3. Munitions requirements.

       7.8.1.9. Off-base sorties.
       7.8.1.10. On equipment training requirements.
       7.8.1.11. Other special requirements.
   7.8.2. Once the weekly schedule is reviewed and signed by the OG/CC, MXG/CC and
   WG/CC it becomes the final planning guide for both operations and maintenance and the
   basis for deviation reporting. The schedule will be followed as printed or as amended by
   coordinated changes. Coordinated changes do not negate reporting deviations IAW Lead
   Command guidance. PS&D distributes the schedule to each appropriate activity and work
   center NLT 1200 (1400 for AETC) Friday preceding the effective week. Weekly flying and
   maintenance schedules may be transmitted electronically provided local security
   requirements are met.
       7.8.2.1. Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC) tasked units (MAF units) will use the
       daily flying schedule as the basis for deviation reporting.
   7.8.3. Home and deployed units will publish a weekly schedule. Include the following in the
   weekly flying and maintenance schedule:
       7.8.3.1. Sortie sequence numbers, aircraft tail numbers (primary and spares), scheduled
       takeoff and landing times, aircraft or equipment scheduled use times, configurations and
       special equipment requirements. Units tasked by TACC need not include aircraft tail
       numbers. Units that fly a published and constant average sortie duration need not publish
       land times.
       7.8.3.2. Spare aircraft requirements. Spare requirements are printed by day for each
       maintenance unit. Generate only the absolute minimum of spare aircraft.
       7.8.3.3. Scheduled maintenance actions, by aircraft and equipment serial number, to
       include inspections, TCTOs, time changes, contract and depot inputs, engine changes,
       washes or corrosion control, document reviews and DDs.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      149

      checklists and Dash-6 TOs. Include the date of change. Automated systems will be used,
      if available.
      7.8.3.9. Lead Commands will develop specific procedures to record and coordinate
      changes to the weekly schedule using an AF IMT 2407. Include minimum approval
      levels for approving changes to the weekly schedule.
      7.8.3.10. Any change to the printed schedule will require an AF IMT 2407 with the
      following exceptions: a change to the original printed takeoff or landing time of 15
      minutes or less; a change of aircrew names, ranges, or airspace; or a change arising after
      the first crew ready time for the squadron’s current day’s scheduled flying window.
          7.8.3.10.1. Changes made during the daily scheduling meeting also require an AF
          IMT 2407.
          7.8.3.10.2. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF IMT 2407 and
          coordinates it through the affected Pro Super, Operations Officer/MX SUPT, and
          required group staff agencies (i.e., MOC, PS&D, etc.) IAW Lead Command
          procedures.
7.9. AMU/AMXS dedicated scheduler. AMU dedicated schedulers are assigned to the MOF
PS&D section and provide dedicated support to the AMUs. AMU element schedulers will:
   7.9.1. Attend and actively participate in daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly flying
   scheduling programs and meetings IAW this chapter and:
      7.9.1.1. Inform AMU supervision of maintenance capabilities or limiting factors that
      could affect maintenance production.
      7.9.1.2. Coordinate with AMU supervision and OS operations schedulers when
      scheduling AMU aircraft to meet flying requirements.
      7.9.1.3. Coordinate the scheduled use of shared resources. Changes during the affected
      week will be documented on an AF IMT 2407.
      7.9.1.4. Provide a listing of JCNs for next week’s scheduled maintenance to the PS&D
      NCOIC by 1600 Friday if JCNs are not listed in the weekly flying and maintenance
      schedule. This list will be used to track MSE. AMU PS&D element will assist in
      determining causes of missed maintenance for reporting MSE.
   7.9.2. Manage the following programs for aircraft assigned to their appointed AMU:
   TCTOs, TCIs and SIs (including installed engine inspections) IAW guidance in this chapter.
 150                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


7.10. Wing Aerospace Vehicle Distribution Officer (AVDO). PS&D performs the AVDO
function IAW AFI 21-103 and maintains the inventory portion of the MIS Inventory, Status and
Utilization subsystem. AVDO will:
   7.10.1. Generate AFTO IMT 103, Aircraft/Missile Condition Data, to record certified
   maintenance needs for aircraft PDM IAW TO 00-25-4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace
   Vehicles and Training Equipment, coordinate it with AMXS supervision
   7.10.2. Coordinate all assignment/possession changes through the Lead Command AVDO
   IAW AFI 21-103 and AFI 16-402.
   7.10.3. Maintain a PDM schedule by tail/serial number for all aircraft and equipment in
   support of AFMC and Lead Command plans and requirements. This listing will contain all
   Lead Command directed modification and maintenance programs. Publish these schedules in
   monthly and quarterly maintenance plans.
   7.10.4. Manage the aircraft transfer/depot program. Coordinate any changes to the
   transfer/depot/ DFT/CFT programs with AMU and all affected agencies.
   7.10.5. Coordinate with PS&D and QA on all AFTO IMT 103s and submit them IAW TO
   00-25-4. Coordinate any resulting changes to the depot program with affected scheduling
   functions.
   7.10.6. Comply with Dash-21 equipment accountability requirements in AFI 21-103 and
   Lead Command supplements.
   7.10.7. Job Standard Master Listing (JML) Management. PS&D maintains (load, change,
   and delete) the JML for all inspections and time changes listed in the applicable aircraft
   Dash-6 and commodity TOs. The EM section maintains the portion of the JML for engine
   inspections and time changes. Maintain JMLs for off-equipment items in the OWC. Provide
   written guidance and training for JML management of off-equipment Job Standards (JSTs)
   when PS&D authorizes OWCs to maintain it. For units using G081, Lead Command weapon
   system managers must maintain master inspection and time change requirements. Once
   Master Job Standard Numbers (MJSNs) are fielded for a weapon system, local PS&D must
   review TO 00-20-2 for MJSN procedures. PS&D must load, change and delete JSTs in the
   MIS as soon as possible after receipt of any Dash-6, or other TO, TCI or inspection change
   and promptly notify all affected PS&D sections for action. PS&D shall:
       7.10.7.1. Load JSTs for all aircraft Dash-6 special/scheduled inspections with
       frequencies greater than 30 days or 50 hours in the MIS. PE, PH, engine changes and
       other event type inspections as they occur (e.g., hard landing) are loaded as a JST in the
       MIS. Provide training for maintaining JSTs as necessary.
       7.10.7.2. Perform a semi-annual review of the JML and all JSTs for accuracy and
       currency. Reconcile TCI and SI JSTs with the aircraft Dash-6 and applicable commodity
       TOs. Document the semi-annual review on AF IMT 2411. Units may create JSTs in the
       MIS to automate required documentation of repetitive complex tasks (e.g., engine
       change, phase inspection, flight control maintenance).
       7.10.7.3. Develop a matrix/chart depicting the total number of SI and TCI requirements
       to be loaded in the MIS for each assigned aircraft and verify against the MIS totals
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       151


      weekly. Overdue and uncorrected discrepancies must be briefed weekly during a
      MXG/CD daily production/scheduling meeting.
      7.10.7.4. Monitor the inspection and time change subsystems in the MIS. Perform a
      comprehensive quarterly review of all inspections, SIs and TCI JSTs for each assigned
      aircraft. Look for missing and/or excess inspections and TCIs loaded to the aircraft.
      Ensure the accuracy of all due dates/ times for TCIs and verify the date of manufacture
      (DOM) and date of installation (DOI). Document the review, establish a suspense date
      and follow-up to ensure corrections are received. Maintain the report on file with
      corrective actions until the next review. The use of automated verification tools is
      encouraged provided MIS data is the source for verification.

   notified by the aircraft owning organization of an I/UA TCTO, Cont/Exp PS&D will host a
   TCTO meeting.
       7.12.5.1. Purpose of the meeting is to determine if the Cont/Exp unit has the
       maintenance capability to perform the TCTO. Invite AMU, QA and affected work
       centers. Notify the E-MXG/CC of the unit’s capability to perform the TCTO. Develop
       and implement local tracking methodology to track TCTO completion. Update MIS when
       the aircraft owning PS&D loads the requisite JST/JCNS.
       7.12.5.2. Cont/Exp PS&D will only maintain aircraft urgent/immediate action TCTO
       files while active. Once TCTOs are completed and loaded in MIS send records to
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         153


     homestation for filing. A TCTO meeting is not necessary for Routine Action aircraft
     TCTOs.
     7.12.5.3. A full TCTO program IAW this chapter is required for AGE and other SE
     which is assigned to the contingency unit. This is intended to cover equipment that does
     not rotate with aviation packages.
     7.12.5.4. Monthly and weekly maintenance planning. Cont/Exp PS&D will produce
     maintenance plans detailing all known maintenance requirements for the upcoming
     month/week.
         7.12.5.4.1. This plan will detail by tail number, Due date, JST and a description of
         the scheduled maintenance required for the time period; use of the AF IMT 2401 is
         not required. The list will be published 2-days prior to the covered time period,
         coordinated through maintenance supervision, and approved by the MXG/CC.
         7.12.5.4.2. The weekly list will additionally identify those actions which will be
         deferred. It will specifically identify if the action is deferred for mission requirements
         or due to lack of capability. Actions which are not identified as “pre-deferred” are
         expected to be accomplished during the upcoming week.
         7.12.5.4.3. MSE will not be calculated for Cont/Exp units. It is anticipated that
         Cont/Exp unit require a great deal of flexibility to meet mission requirements.
  7.12.6. Cont/Exp organizations will not be responsible for Aircraft Generation Planning,
  Transfer Inspections, Flying Maintenance Planning Cycle, First Look, Annual/quarterly Mx
  Planning, AVDO and 2R1 functional management responsibilities.
  7.12.7. Contingency/expeditionary PS&D will develop procedures with homestation
  AVDOs to communicate and ensure AVDO responsibilities are performed.

                               QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA)

8.1. General. Maintenance quality and equipment reliability is the responsibility of all
maintenance personnel. The combined efforts of QA personnel, maintenance leaders, and
technicians are necessary to ensure high quality maintenance production and equipment
reliability. The QA staff evaluates the quality of maintenance accomplished and performs
necessary functions to manage the wing/group’s Maintenance Standardization Evaluation
Program (MSEP). The MSEP provides an objective sampling of the quality of equipment, the
proficiency of maintenance personnel, and the compliance of Lead Command and Unit MSEP
focus areas, programs, and processes. QA personnel are not an extension of the work force and
shall not be tasked to perform production inspections. QA serves as the primary technical
advisory agency in the maintenance organization, assisting maintenance supervision at all levels
to resolve quality problems. The evaluation and analysis of deficiencies and problem areas are
key functions of QA that highlight and identify underlying causes of poor quality in the
maintenance production effort. Aircraft and equipment condition and personnel proficiency are
validated through the MSEP and shall be recorded using a Lead Command-approved QA
database. Civil service and contracted organizations to include MEO/HPO shall follow the
requirements established in their respective contract and accepted quality program.

8.10. Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP). The MSEP is the
Maintenance component of the Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) and is
designed to provide unit maintenance managers with a method of evaluating compliance with
AF, Lead Command and local maintenance directives and policies. The LCAP, AFI 20-111,
Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP), is the Air Force evaluation program that
establishes the Logistics Compliance Assessment Program Team. Its purpose is to provide a
HHQ validation of logistics organization’s compliance with AF, Lead Command and unit
directives.
   8.10.1. Unit Responsibilities . Units are responsible for developing their MSEP and
   conducting local inspections to ensure their programs, processes, maintenance technician
   proficiency, equipment condition and other focus areas are in compliance with AF, Lead
   Command and local directives.
   8.10.2. Types of MSEP Evaluations and Inspections. The following types of evaluations,
   inspections and observations support the MSEP: PEs, QVIs, SIs, MIs, DSVs, TDVs, UCRs
   (see para 8.10.13-17 for explanations of each) and when directed, other inspections. These
   inspection terms may differ based on Lead Command-approved QA databases.
   8.10.3. Applicability to Contract Maintenance Activities. The unit level MSEP is not
   applicable to contract maintenance activities unless required by the SOW/PWS/PRS/contract.
   8.10.4. Executing the Unit MSEP. The MSEP is executed by QA, which permits the
   MXG/CC to focus the unit program on problem areas where improvements are needed. Units
   may develop a local system to track inspection reports until closed.
   8.10.5. Unit MSEP Evaluation Criteria. Units will use AF-Level Functional Checklists, Lead
   Command supplements and local supplements if applicable. For evaluations of technician
   proficiency and equipment condition, applicable technical data is the evaluation standard.
   Local directives will also be used.
   8.10.6. Unit MSEP Grading. Units must grade their MSEP evaluations using objective
   ratings (Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory). The unit MSEP
   shall publish a final report of findings, problem areas, and recommended improvements (as
   required), from the evaluation for distribution to MXG/CC and all inspected organizations
   monthly (quarterly for ANG).
      8.10.6.1. Inspections and evaluations performed (e.g., PE, SI, QVI) will be rated
      “PASS/FAIL”. EXCEPTION: See AFI 21-200 and AFI 21-204 for additional
      information on Nuclear Weapons PEs and certification program.
      8.10.6.2. Units will use the following five tier rating system:
          8.10.6.2.1. Outstanding 95-100%
          8.10.6.2.2. Excellent 90-94.99%
          8.10.6.2.3. Satisfactory 80-89.99%
          8.10.6.2.4. Marginal 70-79.99%
          8.10.6.2.5. Unsatisfactory 0-69.99%
160                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      8.10.6.3. Ratings are calculated by dividing the total number of inspections passed by
      total completed. For example, QA inspects 10 aircraft preflights with the following
      results: 9 “passes” and 1 “failure”. Divide the total “passes” by the total inspections
      (9/10=0.90) 90 percent for an “Excellent” rating.
         8.10.6.3.1. Deduct 0.5 percentage points from overall percentage grade for each
         TDV, DSV, and UCR. For example, a squadron earns an overall rating of 90 percent,
         “Excellent”. However, QA observed 4 TDVs and 3 DSVs. Multiply the sum (7) by
         0.5 and subtract the product (3.5) from the original 90 percent. The adjusted total is
         86.5 percent; therefore, the squadron is rated “Satisfactory”.
  8.10.7. A cumulative Mx Group score will be determined by dividing the Group’s total
  number of inspections and evaluations passed by the total inspections and evaluations
  completed. Deduct 0.5 percentage points for each TDV, DSV, and UCR from the overall
  percentage grade, using same formula in paragraph 8.10.6.3.1.
  8.10.8. Unit MSEP Focus Areas. The purpose of the MSEP is to measure how well units
  meet or exceed standards. QA shall assess how well units are meeting compliance goals and
  look for areas of opportunity for improvement. The results of the evaluations and inspections
  are organized into a summary, in addition to the focus areas listed in AFI 20-111 the
  following areas must be addressed:
      8.10.8.1. Compliance with and currency of TOs and directives. Personnel at all levels are
      responsible and accountable for enforcing this mandatory standard. Ensure all applicable
      TOs and directives are complete, current and used.
      8.10.8.2. Aircraft and equipment forms documentation. Ensure forms used to document
      any maintenance related action for aircraft or equipment are documented according to 00-
      20 series TOs, specific equipment TO requirements and applicable command directives
      and supplements.
      8.10.8.3. Aircraft and Equipment Inspections. Inspect aircraft and equipment (including
      munitions) IAW TOs and directives.
      8.10.8.4. Compliance and Management of Safety, Environmental, Bioenvironmental,
      Housekeeping, and FOD Programs. Personnel at all levels are responsible for minimizing
      risk to equipment and personnel.
      8.10.8.5. Training. Verify training is correctly documented and ensure individuals are
      qualified to perform evaluated tasks.
      8.10.8.6. Unit Directed Programs. Verify units’ programs are in compliance with local
      directives.
      8.10.8.7. Key Task List (KTL). The KTL is an AF, Lead Command or Unit developed
      list of required inspections. The KTL must cover tasks that are complex and those
      affecting safety of flight. All maintenance actions/functions listed on the KTL require
      mandatory call-in to QA each time the maintenance action/function is accomplished. QA
      evaluators will respond and perform an evaluation, but on a limited basis may waive the
      inspection. QA must review and update the list at least every 2 years to ensure it
      encompasses those maintenance actions/functions directly affecting quality of
      maintenance. Lead Commands may identify minimum KTLs for each MDS.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                   161


     8.10.8.8. Routine Inspection List (RIL). The RIL is an AF, Lead Command or Unit
     developed list of routine inspections that must be performed. Frequency is determined by
     MXG/CC. QA shall consolidate Operations Officer/MX SUPT inputs/suggested changes
     and obtain MXG/CC approval. Additional requirements for nuclear capable units are
     located in AFI 21-200. Tasks shall not be removed from the RIL without issuing
     authorities’ approval (e.g., AF, Lead Command, MXG/CC). The RIL must contain the
     following if applicable to the unit:

        8.10.8.8.20. Equipment corrosion inspections.
        8.10.8.8.21. Environmental compliance
        8.10.8.8.22. NWRM Accountability and forms documentation
     8.10.8.9. QA must coordinate with Munitions Activity to ensure all required inspections
     are performed IAW AFI 21-200 series publications. Additionally, QA, in coordination
     with the Munitions Flt CC/Chief (or Operations Officer/ MX SUPT in a MUNS), must
     develop quarterly standards for the following areas:
        8.10.8.9.1. Munitions accountability.
162                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


         8.10.8.9.2. Munitions storage practices, security and safety.
         8.10.8.9.3. Munitions inspections.
         8.10.8.9.4. Munitions materiel handling and test equipment.
         8.10.8.9.5. Munitions stockpile management.
         8.10.8.9.6. Tactical missiles records system.
         8.10.8.9.7. Munitions infrastructure (e.g., adequacy of lightning protection and
         grounding systems, bonding of facility doors, adequate power conversion equipment).
         8.10.8.9.8. Munitions training programs.
  8.10.9. Unit MSEP Evaluation and Inspection Plan. QA develops an evaluation and
  inspection plan showing areas, types and numbers of inspections and evaluations that must be
  conducted. The inspection plan will be coordinated through each squadron MOO/Supt. When
  developing the plan, QA OIC/SUPT (MXW QA Chief) will:
      8.10.9.1. Address areas of concern identified by maintenance managers and the WWM.
      8.10.9.2. Tailor the plan for each squadron, flight or section.
      8.10.9.3. Review, formalize and distribute the inspection or evaluation plan.
  8.10.10. Discrepancy Categories. (ALC use different terms based on MIS)
      8.10.10.1. Category I (CAT I). A required inspection/TO procedural item missed or
      improperly completed. This category is a specific work card item or TO step, Note,
      caution or warning for a specific condition or action. Use sub-classifications of major or
      minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
      8.10.10.2. Category II (CAT II). An obvious defect, which could have been readily
      detected by a technician or supervisor, but is not a specific work card item or TO step,
      Note, caution or warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major
      or minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
  8.10.11. Definitions of major and minor.
      8.10.11.1. A major finding is defined as a condition that would endanger personnel,
      jeopardize equipment or system reliability, impact safety of flight or warrant
      discontinuing the process or equipment operation. Any Major discrepancy will result in
      an automatic inspection failure. NOTE: The inspector can/should declare a major finding
      when one additional action “would” result in one of the following; endanger personnel,
      jeopardize equipment or system reliability, impact safety of flight or warrant
      discontinuing the process or equipment operation. To clarify the inspector should
      intercede to prevent one of the above occurrences from happening but may still write up a
      major finding even though the jeopardizing action was never taken due to their
      intercession.
      8.10.11.2. A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires repair
      or correction, but does not endanger personnel, impact safety of flight, jeopardize
      equipment reliability or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment operation. CAT II
      minors shall be documented for trends, but must not be counted against the AQL. NOTE:
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      163


     FO contained in tool kits or found in cargo areas of aircraft which pose no FOD threat are
     classified as a minor finding since it would require more than one additional action to
     meet the definition of a major finding.
  8.10.12. Discrepancy Reporting. Report the discrepancy to the applicable work centers. QA
  must provide a reference for identified discrepancies using work cards, job guides, WUC
  manuals, checklists, AFOSHSTDs, TOs, and other directives.
  8.10.13. Detected Safety Violations, Technical Data Violations, and Unsatisfactory
  Condition Reports (DSV, TDV and UCR). This category represents observed events or
  conditions with safety implications or technical violations not related to an inspection or
  evaluation and are considered unsafe, not IAW established procedures, or in the case of
  equipment, unfit to operate. The Lead Command-approved QA database will be used to
  document any of the following conditions:
     8.10.13.1. DSV. An unsafe act by an individual. The inspector must stop the unsafe act
     immediately. Do not document a separate DSV on an individual undergoing a personnel
     evaluation since the unsafe act automatically results in a "Fail" rating on the PE. Use the
     word "Safety" when a safety violation is committed during a PE.
     8.10.13.2. TDV. An observation of any person performing maintenance without the
     proper technical data available, available but not in use or not following the correct
     sequence of steps (if directed). The technician must have knowledge of all general
     directives associated with the job prior to performing the task. However, those directives
     need not be present at the job site. Do not document a separate TDV on an individual
     undergoing a PE, since failure to use technical data automatically results in a "Fail"
     rating.
     8.10.13.3. UCR. An unsafe or unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to
     the work center supervisor. UCRs will be documented even when it is not possible to
     determine who created the condition.
  8.10.14. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is an over-the-shoulder (direct) evaluation of a
  maintenance action or inspection. Use PEs to evaluate job proficiency, degree of training and
  compliance with technical data. Individuals performing, supervising or evaluating
  maintenance tasks are subject to a PE. Rate PEs “Pass or Fail” based on established
  AQLs/standards. Document the PE in the Lead Command-approved database. Ensure a PE is
  accomplished on all technicians who perform maintenance. Lead Commands will determine
  the frequency of PEs. Personnel in any AFSC, certified to perform nuclear maintenance or
  logistics operations (e.g., limited general maintenance, transfer, transport, etc.), will also
  comply with applicable personnel evaluation requirements in AFI 21-200, Chapter 8.
     8.10.14.1. Performing a PE. When performing a PE, the QA inspector briefs the
     individual or team on the evaluation and how it will be rated. QA inspector will
     determine what task will be evaluated. A task will not be created for the sole purpose of
     accomplishing a PE. The PE will include an evaluation of: The individual’s training
     records, SCR (if task requires), tool box, TMDE, and TOs used to perform the task. The
     evaluation starts when the individual or team begins the task, or portion of the task to be
     evaluated, and is completed when the task or previously determined portion of the task is
164                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      finished. Provide feedback to the individual or team and supervision upon completion.
      The types of PEs are:
         8.10.14.1.1. Individual Evaluations. This is a QA over-the-shoulder (direct)
         evaluation of a technician or supervisor performing a job. PEs may be performed on
         individuals working alone or as part of a team.
         8.10.14.1.2. Team Evaluations. This is a QA over-the-shoulder (direct) evaluation of
         technicians and supervisors performing a team task. A team task is one requiring
         more than one person to complete the task (e.g., refueling, ECM pod up/down
         loading, bomb build-up, towing, weapons maintenance, pylon installation).
         Evaluations must accurately assess the proficiency of each individual under
         evaluation. Refer to AFI 21-200 for nuclear weapons maintenance and handling
         evaluations.
         8.10.14.1.3. QA will conduct PE’s on each NDI technician, for each NDI method
         annually (Reservisit will be every 2-years, 18 months for full-time Guardsmen and 36
         months for Drill Status Guardsmen), to ensure effective trending on NDI methods.
      8.10.14.2. Rating Personnel Evaluations. QA rates each evaluation based on
      AQLs/standards (see paragraph 8.10.18 for AQL definitions/standards). The rating
      applies only to the specific task evaluated and not to other tasks that a technician or
      supervisor is qualified to perform. Upon completion of a failed evaluation, the evaluator
      must provide on-the-spot feedback. Determine ratings as follows:
         8.10.14.2.1. Pass: Number of discrepancies does not exceed AQL/standards.
         8.10.14.2.2. Fail: An evaluation that results in any of the following:
             8.10.14.2.2.1. Number of discrepancies exceeds the established AQL/standards.
             8.10.14.2.2.2. A technician fails to detect a major discrepancy while complying
             with an inspection or TO requirement.
             8.10.14.2.2.3. A technician fails to comply with a technical data step that could
             affect the performance of the equipment involved or cause injury to personnel. Do
             not document a separate Technical Data Violation (TDV) on an individual
             undergoing a PE, since failure to use technical data automatically results in a
             “Fail” rating.
             8.10.14.2.2.4. A technician demonstrates a lack of technical proficiency or
             system knowledge.
             8.10.14.2.2.5. Training/certification not documented.
             8.10.14.2.2.6. A technician commits a safety violation. Use the word “Safety”
             when a safety violation is committed during a PE. Do not document a separate
             Detected Safety Violation (DSV) on an individual undergoing a personnel
             evaluation since the unsafe act automatically results in a “Fail” rating on the PE.
             See definition of DSV in this chapter.
             8.10.14.2.2.7. A technician fails to document maintenance actions in appropriate
             equipment records.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        165


             8.10.14.2.2.8. For nuclear weapons maintenance, an unsatisfactory rating must be
             given when any deficiencies or applicable unsatisfactory conditions exists IAW
             Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3263.05, Nuclear Weapons
             Technical Inspections, or AFI 21-200.
  8.10.15. Quality Verification Inspections (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
  condition, or a maintenance process, an assessment following a maintenance inspection,
  servicing or repair action, or verification that a technician or supervisor properly completed
  an inspection or repair action. QVIs shall not be conducted after equipment operation when
  such operation could invalidate indications of proper job accomplishment. Limit QVIs to the
  same inspection card deck or technical data required for the job. This inspection does not
  require disassembling parts, removing stress panels or like actions. A QVI for required Dash-
  6 TO inspections may be accomplished by checking a portion of the required card or area.
  The QVI report should reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and
  identify specific discrepancies. Document discrepancies in active equipment records and
  forms (i.e., AFTO Form/IMT 781A, AFTO IMT 244 and AF IMT 2420, Quality Assurance
  Inspection Summary for ALCs, AFMC IMT 343, Quality Assurance Assessment or in the
  Quality Information Management Standard System (QIMSS)).
     8.10.15.1. Rating QVIs. Rate QVIs “pass” or “fail” by comparing the number of
     discrepancies with the established AQLs/standards.
         8.10.15.1.1. Pass:   Number     of   discrepancies    does    not   exceed    established
         AQL/standard.
         8.10.15.1.2. Fail: An inspection that results in any of the following:
             8.10.15.1.2.1. A technician fails to detect a major discrepancy while complying
             with an inspection or TO requirement.
             8.10.15.1.2.2. Number of CAT I minor discrepancies exceeds the established
             AQL/standard.
             8.10.15.1.2.3. A technician is not signed off in training records as task qualified.
         8.10.15.1.3. Document the QVI in the Lead Command-approved QA database. Each
         QVI is chargeable to the technician or supervisor who signed off/cleared the
         “corrected by” block or “inspected by” block of the applicable maintenance form or
         equipment record. When evaluating the technician who signed off the “inspected by”
         block, evaluate only the items normally verified by signing off the “Red-X”. Only
         one evaluation shall be scored for each inspection.
  8.10.16. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs, PEs or MIs. SIs
  may include, but are not limited to, aircraft and equipment forms inspections, document file
  inspections, CTKs, TO files, vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety practices, FOD
  Program, etc. SIs may be condition, procedural or compliance oriented. The Lead Command-
  approved QA database will be used to document special inspections. SIs can be non-rated. If
  rating a SI, rate as “Pass” or “Fail” based on established AQLs/standards.
  8.10.17. Management Inspection (MI). Perform these inspections to follow-up on trends,
  conduct investigations or conduct research to get to the root cause of problems. GP/CC,
  SQ/CC or work center supervisors may request MIs. MIs may encompass PE/QVI trends and
166                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


  other inspection data; NMC causes; aborts and trends; in-flight emergency trends; high
  component or system failure rates; suspected training deficiencies, and tasks outlined in
  aircraft Dash-6 TOs. Report MI results to the requester. MIs can be non-rated and may be
  counted in QA trends. The Lead Command-approved QA database will be used to document
  management inspections.
  8.10.18. Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL). An AQL deNotes the maximum allowable
  number of minor findings that a process or product may be charged for the task to be rated
  “Pass.” It must be strict enough that the task, process or product meets an acceptable level of
  quality, but isn’t so strict that a “pass” rating is unattainable. The AQL is derived/revised
  from QA performance-based data.
      8.10.18.1. Lead Commands may develop standardized AQLs by weapon system and
      establish procedures to review at least annually.
      8.10.18.2. GP/CCs will establish AQLs for tasks/inspections not included on the Lead
      Command AQL.
      8.10.18.3. AQLs/baselines for nuclear maintenance, cruise missile maintenance and
      nuclear weapons handling tasks are defined in AFI 21-200.
      8.10.18.4. AQLs will be published in the unit’s evaluation and inspection plan IAW
      para 8.10.9.
  8.10.19. Monthly Summary (quarterly for the ARC). The MSEP summary advises the
  WG/CC and GP/ CCs of the quality of maintenance. The monthly summary shall be
  published and distributed to the WG/CC, GP/CC and appropriate activities in the
  maintenance complex. To ensure the greatest visibility possible for MSEP summaries,
  classified parts must be published separately from the main summary. Compile the summary
  from inspection data and load crew evaluation statistics (provided by WS). The MSEP
  summary will include visual information, graphs, narratives, quality trends identified through
  inspections and evaluations, discussion of common problem areas and descriptions of
  successful programs or initiatives. The following areas must be addressed in the summary:
      8.10.19.1. Compliance with and currency of TOs and directives to include unit.
      8.10.19.2. Aircraft and equipment forms documentation.
      8.10.19.3. Compliance and Management of Safety, Environmental, Housekeeping, and
      FOD Programs.
      8.10.19.4. Training Program.
      8.10.19.5. Key Task List (KTL).
      8.10.19.6. Routine Inspection List (RIL).
      8.10.19.7. Munitions Program.
      8.10.19.8. High-missed carded items.
         8.10.19.8.1. A high-missed carded item is defined as any work card item missed at
         least three times during a one-month period. Units should use the high-missed carded
         items to enhance maintenance-training programs, detect trends and improve the
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     167


          quality of maintenance. MMA will review items to identify any relationships with
          repeat, recur and CND trends.
      8.10.19.9. Narrative Report: The monthly narrative report must contain an analysis of the
      MSEP results, a summary of significant CAT I and II discrepancies, technical inspections
      and recommendations for improvement. Prior to preparing the narrative report, QA must
      conduct a study of trends.
      8.10.19.10. Trend Analysis. Review previous reports to determine if inspected areas
      have improved or declined. Consistent high scores in any category may indicate the
      programs emphasis is not focused on the unit’s actual problem areas. Low scoring areas
      may require a reassessment of the corrective actions taken by management. Continuous
      communication between MMA, unit leadership, maintenance supervision, and QA
      personnel is essential. Highlight trends and root causes in the summary.
   8.10.20. MSEP Meetings. The GP/unit must conduct quarterly meetings to review MSEP
   data. The MXW/MXG/CC shall chair the meeting. Attendees must include, as a minimum,
   SQ/CCs, MOO/MX SUPTs, WWMs, Chief Inspector, and senior analysts.
   8.10.20. (NASIC) Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP) Meetings.
   NASIC/GXF will conduct quarterly meetings to review MSEP data. The GXF/CC will chair
   the meeting. Attendees will include GXF/SIA, GXF/DO, QA Supt, Flt/CC’s and GXFO
   Chief Engineer.
8.11. Lead Command-approved QA database. Units will use their Lead Command approved
data base to capture MSEP data. Lead Commands will ensure the data fields contained in the
database include:
   8.11.1. Work center: Input the shop code whose process was inspected.
   8.11.2. Inspector: Enter the employee number of the inspector.

        e-mail transmission or Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition Logistics Support (JCALS)
        to the appropriate action agency.
        8.12.2.2.3. Maintain an AFTO IMT 22 suspense file. NOTE: An Approved AFTO
        Form 22 does not provide authority to deviate from current TO procedures. TO
        changes must be posted to implement approved AFTO IMT 22s.
        8.12.2.2.4. Conduct a technical review of disapproved AFTO IMT 22 to determine
        whether to resubmit with additional information. Consider for submission to technical
        working groups (e.g., PIWG, MDS maintainer’s conferences). Dispose of
        disapproved AFTO IMT 22 IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule located at
        https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
     8.12.2.3. Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability Code (SMR) change request. The
     AFTO 22 process must be used to submit an SMR change request. The PIM will:
        8.12.2.3.1. Track the status of SMR change requests.
        8.12.2.3.2. Conduct a technical review of SMR change requests returned from depots
        and item managers with an unsatisfactory answer to determine whether to resubmit
        with additional information. Consider for submission to technical working groups
        (e.g., PIWG, MDS maintainer’s conferences).
        8.12.2.3.3. Coordinate repair evaluation meetings when approved SMR change
        requests affect several agencies.
        8.12.2.3.4. Serve as focal point for base level repair and manufacturing capability.
     8.12.2.4. Reliability and Maintainability (R&M). At the core of R&M efforts are
     technical working groups (e.g., PIWG, MDS maintainers’ conferences). Assessing unit
     R&M concerns involves several processes. The PIM will:
        8.12.2.4.1. Forward inputs IAW AFI 21-118.
        8.12.2.4.2. Review all reported R&M deficiencies and determine those caused by
        unit factors and local conditions versus those beyond the unit's control.
        8.12.2.4.3. Review available maintenance and supply trends and high work hour
        consuming repairs. Analysis provides the majority of this information.
        8.12.2.4.4. Consolidate R&M deficiency reports/functional area reports for each
        system (e.g., AGE, weapons, PMEL, avionics, engines, commodities and airframe)
        and prioritize proposed items for a particular system IAW weighted factors in AFI
        21-118.

           appropriate base agencies.
           8.12.2.4.7. Maintain a file for all R&M deficiencies (non-quality) but not meeting the
           criteria for submission to AFMC. If required, these deficiencies are tracked for future
           PIWG action on a product improvement worksheet IAW AFI 21-118.
8.13. Configuration Management (CM) and Modification Management. QA is responsible
for CM and Modification management. This includes reviewing, submitting and tracking unit
modification proposals being worked by Lead Commands and ensuring proper implementation
of approved modification instructions or TCTOs. Follow procedures outlined in Chapter 7 of
this instruction for specific QA responsibilities in the TCTO process. Modifications will be
managed/documented IAW AFI 63-131, TO 00-20-2 and TO 00-5-15. QA will establish a
process for updating the Integrated Maintenance Information System (IMIS) for weapon systems
(e.g. F-15E) that require manual updates for TCTO configuration. Due to the nature of the
system, it is imperative that a focal point be established to ensure the IMIS system reflects
current aircraft status and configuration.
8.14. Technical Order Distribution Office (TODO). The TODO ensures TOs are managed
IAW AFPD 21-3, AFI 63-101 and TO 00-5-1. Establish the PMEL TODO under the control of
the TMDE Flight. TO 00-5-1 provides criteria for establishing levels of TO distribution
activities. Additionally, TODO offices shall control electronic technical data configuration IAW
Chapter 10 of this instruction. TODO will.
   8.14.1. Coordinate with QA subject matter expert (SME) (or production planning team and
   QA representative for ALC) for each incoming TCTO to determine applicability. NOTE: All
   TCTOs received from outside agencies must be routed through QA for the review process.
       8.14.1.1. Determine TCTO applicability by aircraft serial number for aircraft, engine
       serial number for engines, and by part number or other specific criteria for commodities.
       8.14.1.2. Date stamp TCTOs to reflect the date the hard copy is received. Date stamping
       all TCTOs with the date received indicates QA has reviewed the TCTO and that it is
       applicable. Only date stamped TCTOs are authorized for use. NOTE: The compliance
       period start date for an inspection TCTO is upon receipt of the TCTO itself and it must be
       completed entirely within the stated time frame or the affected system/equipment must be
       removed from service.
       8.14.1.3. Provide copies of the TCTO to the work centers doing the work. Mark these
       TCTOs as “working copy/destroy when complete”. Do not place these working copies in
       a formal TO file.
       8.14.1.4. Provide a file copy of the TCTO to PS&D or weapon system support center for
       ALC.
       8.14.1.5. Ensure personnel assigned as a TODO/Technical Order Distribution Account
       (TODA) managers meet requirements set forth in TO 00-5-1, AFI 63-101 and applicable
       directives.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     171


  8.14.2. Manage the QA Central TO File. As a minimum, the QA file must contain copies
  (paper copies for paper-only TOs or local access to digital TOs) of general and procedural
  TOs and copies of all TCTOs pertaining to the equipment owned, operated or maintained by
  the GP/CC. The file is kept to meet QA requirements, not to duplicate TOs held by
  maintenance work centers.
  8.14.3. Manage TO accounts IAW TO 00-5-1. In addition to its designed purpose as
  established in TO 00-5-1, Enhanced Technical Information Management Systems (ETIMS)
  serves as a locator for maintenance TOs. Updates are based on information from squadron
  TODA requisitions.
  8.14.4. TODOs must use ETIMS to establish and maintain records for all TO accounts IAW
  TO 00-5-1.
  8.14.5. Local Work Cards, Job Guides, Page Supplements and Checklists. Limit use of local
  work cards (LWC), local job guides (LJG), local page supplements (LPS) or local checklists
  (LCL) to accomplish maintenance on AF equipment. Locally prepared technical instructions
  must not be used to circumvent AFMCs inherent responsibility for technical data (see TO 00-
  5-1). The TODO must review and manage all locally developed products IAW TO 00-5-1
  and Lead Command supplements for safety and adequacy of procedures. Ensure LWCs,
  LJGs, LPSs and LCLs are reviewed for currency when source reference data changes.
  Develop OIs to comply with these policies.
  8.14.6. TO Change Notification. The TODO must prepare a list of all changes and revisions
  to indexes, TOs, inspection work cards and checklists. This list must include TO number and
  date received. This list must be included in the wing’s weekly maintenance plan and flying
  schedule or electronically linked. Supervisors must review the list of changes and ensure all
  personnel are aware a change or revision has been received. Additionally, “Immediate”
  action TCTOs must be dealt with upon receipt, and “Urgent Action” TCTOs, safety
  supplements and interim supplements must be brought to the attention of supervisors within
  24 hours of receipt.
  8.14.7. TO File Inspections. The Lead TODO shall inspect other maintenance
  TODOs/TODAs in the maintenance complex at least annually along with performing spot
  checks of TO files. As a minimum, the TODO will develop an inspection checklist or use the
  “TODO, TODA and Library Custodian Checklist” provided in TO 00-5-1. As part of this
  inspection, the TODO will confirm TODO/TODA personnel and Library Custodian have
  completed the mandatory minimum requirements of TO System training.
  8.14.8. TODOs must effectively control the electronic data configuration on applicable E-
  Tools IAW Chapter 10 of this instruction.
  8.14.9. TODOs shall maintain records of Automated Computer Program Identification
  Number System (ACPINS) using TOs 00-5-1, 00-5-16, and 00-5-17. TODOs shall set up
  software sub-accounts with each appropriate shop/section and ensure each shop/section has
  the most current software on hand. Additionally, TODOs shall include ACPINs in the routine
  and annual checks required by TO 00-5-1. NOTE: TODO will have access to Authorized
  Software Configuration Matrix (ASCM) to ensure assigned CV-22 units have the most
  current software.
 172                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


8.15. One-Time Inspections (OTI) program. The OTI program will be managed by the MXG
IAW TO 00-20-1. OTIs are normally look-only actions to verify the existence of suspected
equipment conditions or malfunctions.
8.16. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) to include Operational Check Flights (OCFs).
   8.16.1. Check Flights are performed to ensure an aircraft is airworthy and/or capable of
   accomplishing its mission. FCFs are not normally flown when the airworthiness of the
   aircraft can be determined by maintenance operational checks prescribed by a technical
   directive. Additional guidance may be found in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management; AFI 11-
   202V3, General Flight Rules; AFI 13-201, AF Airspace Management; TO 1-1-300,
   Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance Operational Checks; TO 00-20-1; and
   applicable Dash-6 and Dash-1 TOs. The OG/CC is responsible for appointing an FCF OIC.
       8.16.1.1. OCFs must be kept to a minimum and are not used to replace Dash-6 FCF
       requirements. OCFs must be flown by experienced aircrews (not required to be an FCF
       qualified aircrew), must be briefed by QA for aircraft condition, and accomplished
       following the same maintenance criteria as FCFs.
   8.16.2. The FCF OIC and QA FCF manager will:
       8.16.2.1. Establish local FCF procedures and checklists for any specific local aircraft
       requirements to include configuration, administration, control, and documentation of the
       FCF, program. Coordinate them with OG Standardization/Evaluation. Procedures will be
       published in the wing supplement/OI to this instruction.
       8.16.2.2. Coordinate with the appropriate squadron for an FCF pilot/aircrew and provide
       squadron operations with the aircraft tail number, reason for the FCF and anticipated
       takeoff time.
       8.16.2.3. Maintain an information file for briefing aircrews. As a minimum, this file must
       contain unit directives concerning FCF procedures and an FCF checklist for each MDS
       assigned.
       8.16.2.4. An FCF checklist must be used for each FCF.
       8.16.2.5. QA must debrief all FCFs with the appropriate debrief function. During
       debriefing, the FCF checklist and aircraft forms must be reviewed to determine if all
       requirements have been accomplished. After completing the review, the checklist must be
       sent to PS&D for inclusion in the aircraft jacket file.
       8.16.2.6. Maintain a copy of the AF IMT 2400, Functional Check Flight Log, or
       equivalent automated product for deficiency and trend analysis.
   8.16.3. The QA FCF manager will:
       8.16.3.1. Ensure the FCF aircrew is briefed on the purpose and extent of the flight,
       previous maintenance problems and discrepancies recorded on the aircraft or engines
       related to the FCF.
       8.16.3.2. Ensure aircraft W&B documents are reviewed.
       8.16.3.3. Ensure AF IMT 2400 or an equivalent automated product is maintained to
       provide information for evaluation and analysis. Include the date and time of the FCF,
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        173


       aircraft serial number, reason for FCF, name of debriefer and name of aircraft
       commander. The FCF Log also indicates if the aircraft was released for flight, reasons for
       any non-release, action taken and date completed and the date maintenance documents
       were forwarded to PS&D or records section.
       8.16.3.4. Ensure all maintenance actions are completed and all AFTO IMTs 781 are
       documented IAW Dash-6 and 00-series TOs.
       8.16.3.5. All maintenance actions on transient aircraft requiring FCF must be reviewed
       by QA prior to FCF. If the aircraft MDS/type is not assigned at the transient base, then
       the owning unit must provide a qualified FCF pilot/crew and maintenance as required.
   8.16.4. The AMU will configure the aircraft for FCF IAW technical data and local
   directives.
   8.16.5. Flight Requirements. The mandatory requirements for FCF are outlined in TO 1-1-
   300 and the applicable Dash-6 TO. FCF profiles are determined by the maintenance
   requirement causing the FCF. The decision to fly a full profile FCF is the decision of the
   MXG/CC (AMXG/CC’s (AMARG/CC’s) and OG/CC’s discretion for ALC). Tailor the FCF
   profile for the discrepancy causing the FCF applying the following guidance:
       8.16.5.1. Require a clean configuration whenever FCFs are flown for flight controls, fuel
       controls or engine changes. Do not remove fixed wing pylons, fixed wing tip tanks and
       fixed external stores unless they interfere with fuel scheduling, aerodynamic reaction, air
       loading, signal propagation, etc.
          8.16.5.1.1. Do not fly FCFs in conjunction with other missions or training
          requirements, unless authorized in TO 1-1-300.
   8.16.6. FCF Release. An FCF release occurs upon the successful completion of all
   requirements as determined by the FCF aircrew. The final decision to release rests solely
   with the aircraft commander. An aircraft may be released for flight if a malfunction occurs
   during an FCF, which is not related to the condition generating the FCF and the original
   condition checks good.
       8.16.6.1. An FCF conditional release may occur when the aircraft does not successfully
       complete FCF requirements due to a specific system malfunction. The FCF aircrew, in
       coordination with maintenance, determines a FCF conditional release if the malfunction
       may be corrected without generating another FCF. If on review of the corrective action
       the FCF aircrew accepts the maintenance action as a satisfactory repair of the
       malfunction, they may release the aircraft from FCF.
       8.16.6.2. FCF Aborts. All ground aborts result in a non-release.
   8.16.7. Units must refer to Lead Command instructions for FCF procedures away from home
   station.
8.17. Inflight Operational Checks. Inflight operational checks are accomplished at the request
of maintenance to validate a maintenance action that cannot be fully verified on the ground.
   8.17.1. Document inflight operational checks IAW TO 00-20-1.
8.18. High Speed Taxi Checks. High speed taxi checks may be utilized IAW TO 1-1-300
instead of FCFs with MXG/CC (AMXG/CC for ALC) and OG/CC authorization, high speed
 174                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


taxi checks may be utilized when a maintenance ground operational check requires aircraft
movement at higher than normal taxi speeds (with qualified FCF aircrews) to operationally
check completed maintenance. Process aircraft forms through QA using FCF procedures. QA
will develop an aircrew briefing checklist specifically for high speed taxi checks, to include the
required FCF briefing items and pertinent warnings, cautions, etc.
   8.18.1. To minimize brake and tire wear, configure aircraft with the minimum Dash-1
   operational fuel requirements. Ensure aircraft is prepared for flight and the
   Exceptional/Conditional release is signed off.
8.19. Weight and Balance (W&B) Program. Manage this program IAW TO 1-1B-50, Basic
Technical Order for USAF Aircraft Weight and Balance.
   8.19.1. The W&B program NCOIC/Manager Responsibilities. NCOIC/Manager will ensure:
       8.19.1.1. Sufficient personnel are qualified on assigned aircraft IAW TO 1-1B-50. The
       weight and balance authority (as determined by the Lead Command) may waive the
       J3AZR2A000–000 Weight and Balance Practical Course for individuals trained by a
       current weight and balance qualified technician and certified by the weight and balance
       authority.
       8.19.1.2. All assigned aircraft are weighed IAW applicable directives. Keep W&B
       documents required by TO 1-1B-50 for each assigned aircraft. Use the Automated
       Weight and Balance System (AWBS), and keep a back-up copy of all W&B documents.
       8.19.1.3. Procedures are written for routing completed TCTO and modification
       information for W&B changes.
       8.19.1.4. A QA W&B qualified technician inspects W&B documents before flight when
       locally accomplished modifications affect the basic aircraft weight and moment. Review
       computations for accuracy.
       8.19.1.5. Essential W&B data and changes to the basic weight and moment are available
       for appropriate mission planning (e.g., Standard Configuration Loads, updates to
       supplemental handbook).
       8.19.1.6. Periodic serviceability inspections are accomplished on unit-stored/maintained
       W&B equipment (as applicable).
       8.19.1.7. Coordination with MOO/MX SUPT (Test Flight Supervisor for ALC) in
       developing a W&B Preparation Checklist if the aircraft Dash-5 TO is not comprehensive
       enough for the task.
       8.19.1.8. W&B manuals are maintained for Class I and II aircraft in a central file.
       Maintain and store Class I and Class II aircraft W&B handbooks IAW TO 1-1B-50. The
       method of supplemental handbook storage and physical location must be standardized by
       the lead command for like MDS. (Manage commercial derivative aircraft IAW this
       instruction, FAA procedures, contract specifications and the manufacturer’s maintenance
       manuals.) The contract logistics support (CLS) contractor is responsible for managing
       W&B programs on these aircraft.
       8.19.1.9. The SCR (appointment letters for ALC) reflects W&B certification.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        175


   8.19.2. W&B Technicians Responsibilities. Will verify scale readings and
   accomplish/oversee the actual computations. Supervise the preparation, leveling and
   weighing of the aircraft IAW MDS specific –2 and –5 series TOs and TO 1-1B-50. Inspect
   W&B documents before flight when locally accomplished modifications affect the basic
   aircraft weight and moment. Review computations for accuracy.
8.20. Chafing Awareness Program. This program is mandatory for fighter aircraft units and
other MDS IAW applicable MDS technical data. QA must monitor and track instances of wire,
harness and metal line/tube chafing. A randomly selected 10 percent of assigned aircraft are
inspected when notification is received of a potential chafing problem involving like model, lot
number or block of aircraft.
   8.20.1. The chief inspector shall recommend initiating an OTI if the sampled aircraft
   indicates a chafing problem or the detected chafing is an operational safety hazard.
   8.20.2. QA must develop local chafing inspection work cards if there are no requirements in
   the Dash-6 TOs, for periodic, pre-flight, thru-flight and basic post-flight inspections. Ensure
   local work cards cover at least 50 percent of accessible areas, focusing on known chafing
   areas.
   8.20.3. QA must utilize a database for the purpose of tracking wire and harness chafing
   problems identified through OTIs and maintenance cross-tell reports. Consult the database
   before expending man-hours performing inspections.
8.21. Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE)/ Quality Assurance Representative (QAR). If a
CLS aircraft or CFT is assigned, a QAE/QAR must be appointed and trained IAW AFI 63-124.

Section 8B—ALC in addition to section 8A the following guidance applies:

8.22. QA Responsibilities. QA to include safety and environmental personnel will be centrally
aligned under the MXW/CC. Responsible to the MXW/CC to perform as the primary technical
advisory agency, assisting maintenance supervision at all levels to resolve quality problems,
jointly develop corrective action strategies and enhance the overall quality of maintenance.
Although centrally aligned at the wing level, a knowledgeable and well qualified QA work force
will be dedicated to, and collocated within the production groups to ensure continuous, seamless
and enduring customer support is provided as required.
   8.22.1. MXW/CC/CL/CD must provide the required resources to ensure effective quality
   assessments of the products, services, programs and processes. The chain of accountability
   and responsibility for quality products, services, programs and processes is directly
   to/through the Commanders, Directors, Division Chiefs, Flight Chiefs, Production
   Superintendents, and maintenance employees and will not be levied on quality organizations.
   In order for the overall QA system to work effectively, all AFMC personnel must take
   responsible actions that will contribute to safety, quality, and productivity.
8.23. MXW Quality Assurance Chief Responsibilities. MXW QA Chief will:

                             IMPOUNDMENT PROCEDURES

9.1. Aircraft and Equipment Impoundment. Aircraft or equipment is impounded when
intensified management is warranted due to system or component malfunction or failure of a
serious or chronic nature. Refer to AFI 91-204 for aircraft and equipment involved in accidents,
mishaps or incidents.
9.2. Specific Guidance. QA is the OPR for the Impoundment Program and develops local
checklists. Impounding aircraft and equipment enables investigative efforts to systematically
proceed with minimal risk relative to intentional/unintentional actions and subsequent loss of
evidence. MXG/CCs will develop and publish (if required) an impoundment program in a local
supplement to this instruction and ensure compliance with the procedures in this chapter. ALC:
MXW/CC will assign an OPR who manages the impoundment program, creates an
impoundment checklist and ensures compliance with the procedures in this chapter.
9.3. Impoundment Terms:
   9.3.1. Authorized Personnel. Individuals directly involved in the management, safing,
   troubleshooting, or repair of impounded aircraft or equipment.
   9.3.2. Impoundment. Impoundment is the isolation or control of access to an aircraft or
   equipment item and applicable historical records so an intensified investigation can be
   completed.
   9.3.3. Impoundment Authority. Individual authorized to impound aircraft or equipment.
   MXG/CCs (or equivalent) will designate Impoundment Authorities and they will be tracked
   on the SCR. The Impoundment Authority will select the Impoundment Official.
   9.3.4. Impoundment Release Authority. Individuals authorized to release aircraft or
   equipment from impoundment. The MXG/CC and MXG/CD (or equivalents) have authority
   to release aircraft and equipment. In the event of a dual MXG/CC and CD absence, the
   MXG/CC or CD will appoint an individual in writing as the designated impoundment release
   authority for the period of the dual absence. This authority will not be delegated in ALC.
   9.3.5. Impoundment Official. The Impoundment Official will hold the minimum rank of
   MSgt (First line supervisor for ALC). Impoundment Officials are the single point of contact
   for the affected aircraft or equipment item and are responsible for controlling, monitoring,
   and investigating the impounded aircraft or equipment.
   9.3.6. Isolation Area. An area designated by the Impoundment Authority to locate
   impounded aircraft or equipment. Aircraft may be isolated on the flightline or in hangars.
   The isolation area will be marked off using cones, ropes, or placards indicating the
   impoundment condition and isolation area.
9.4. Reasons for Impoundment of Aircraft or Equipment. Impound aircraft or equipment:
   9.4.1. When the Impoundment Authority determines extraordinary measures are required to

       component.
       9.4.6.5. When an aircraft experiences a loss of thrust sufficient to prevent maintaining
       level flight at a safe altitude. This includes all cases of multiple engine power loss or roll
       back.
       9.4.6.6. Internal engine damage due to FO which can be isolated to the engine and
       requires removal for repair will result in the engine being impounded. Aircraft
       impoundment is not required.
       9.4.6.7. Engine damaged while in transport.
   9.4.7. When an in-flight fire occurs.
   9.4.8. When an aircraft experiences an in-flight loss of all pitot-static system instruments or
   all gyro stabilized attitude or direction indicators.

   equipment. They are responsible for controlling and monitoring the investigation of
   impounded aircraft or equipment. The Impoundment Official ensures only authorized
   personnel have access to the impounded aircraft or equipment.
9.6. Impoundment Process and Procedures.
   9.6.1. When the Impoundment Authority directs impoundment, a Red X symbol will be
   placed in the applicable AFTO Form/IMT 781A/electronic equivalent or AFTO IMT 244
   with a statement indicating the reason for impoundment and the name of the assigned
   Impoundment Official.
   9.6.2. The MOC/Maintenance Control Center will be notified when an impoundment
   decision has been made.
   9.6.3. The Impoundment Official will use established checklists to guide the sequence of
   actions.
   9.6.4. The Impoundment Official will control access to impounded aircraft or equipment.
   Establish an Entry Control Point (ECP) if required.
      9.6.4.1. If an ECP is established, the Impoundment Official will ensure an access control
      log (manual or electronic) is maintained at the ECP of the impounded aircraft, equipment
      or storage facility to track personnel entering and leaving the area.
          9.6.4.1.1. The log will contain the following information as a minimum: individual’s
          name, rank, and employee number/stamp, date arrived/departed, and reason for entry.
          9.6.4.1.2. The log will be maintained and reviewed on a daily basis until the
          Impoundment Release Authority releases the aircraft and will be disposed of only
          after the aircraft is successfully repaired.
   9.6.5. Aircraft or equipment records will be controlled at the discretion of the Impoundment
   Official. When required, the Impoundment Official will:
      9.6.5.1. Obtain and secure the current aircraft forms and the aircraft jacket file for
      aircraft or the AFTO IMT 244 for equipment.
      9.6.5.2. Notify the MIS DBM (PDMSS, MAXIMO, etc) to isolate the aircraft or
      equipment serial number in order to prevent any changes and maintain the integrity of the
      historical data until the aircraft or equipment is released.
      9.6.5.3. Request any personnel records required to complete the impoundment
      investigation. These records may include, but are not limited to, individual training
      records.
      9.6.5.4. On aircraft impounded for potential safety related incidents, ensure the
      CVR/FDR circuit breakers are pulled immediately after engine shutdown or before
      applying external power to safeguard CVR/FDR data.
   9.6.6. Maintenance will be limited on impounded aircraft or equipment until the cause is
   determined. The Impoundment Official will determine what maintenance can be performed
   in conjunction with the maintenance required to release the aircraft or equipment from
   impoundment. Limit maintenance actions to those required to make the aircraft safe.
 182                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       9.6.6.1. Parts removed from impounded aircraft or equipment will be carefully
       controlled. This is to ensure that parts, once confirmed as the cause for impoundment, are
       available to be processed as DR exhibits.
   9.6.7. The Impoundment Official selects a team of qualified technicians dedicated to
   determine the cause of the problem that led to the impoundment. Impoundment team
   members will be relieved of all other duties (not applicable to ARC) until released by the
   Impoundment Official.
   9.6.8. The Impoundment Release Authority determines the need for a one-time flight and
   requests appropriate authorization IAW TO 00-20-1.
   9.6.9. Once the cause of the malfunction or failure has been positively determined, the
   Impoundment Official briefs the Impoundment Release Authority on findings, corrective
   actions, and requests release of the aircraft or equipment from impoundment.
   9.6.10. If the cause of the discrepancy could potentially affect other aircraft or equipment in
   the fleet, QA (MXG production for ALC) will provide cross-tell information for up-
   channeling to the MAJCOM weapon system functional manager, lead command and the
   designated Weapon System Lead Command IAW AFPD 10-9.
   9.6.11. Clear impoundments from forms/MIS IAW TO 00-20-1.

AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     183


     9.7.2.2. Protect other aircraft or equipment located near the incident if an explosive
     hazard exists.
     9.7.2.3. Do not change the position of any switches except as needed for safety. Limit
     maintenance actions to those actions required to make the aircraft or equipment safe.
  9.7.3. Preserve mishap evidence to the maximum extent possible. An example would be
  segregating an aircraft gun versus destroying it if it poses no immediate danger. This allows
  for evaluation of all the evidence and the ability to recreate the mishap conditions.
  9.7.4. If a malfunctioning munitions item (live or inert) causes a mishap, also notify OO-
  ALC/WM's Munitions Rapid Response Team at DSN 777-4865/5155, 775-5507/3208 and
  777-AMMO or 775-AMMO, or the Hill AFB Command Post at 777-3007. This team is
  comprised of experts (engineers, equipment specialists, program managers and safety
  personnel) from the conventional weapons and munitions programs and can respond within
  24 to 48 hours to assist in determining the cause of a failure. Initial contact, as soon as
  practical, shall allow the team to make travel arrangements and aids response time. For units
  with 20 or 30MM gun systems use of the team is encouraged (not mandatory unless a safety
  issue exists) if the cause of a gun system jam cannot be easily determined or for recurring
  jams. Using the team provides highly valuable information regarding ammunition/gun
  system problems and allows ALC personnel to see issues first hand.

                        TOOL AND EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT

10.1. Tool and Equipment Management. The objectives of the tool and equipment
management program are to prevent and eliminate FOD to aircraft, engines, missiles, training
and support equipment, and to reduce costs through strict effective control and accountability of
assets. To ensure standardization among maintenance units, commanders and key leaders are
responsible for executing an effective tool program. Tool and equipment management applies to
CWOs and ALCs. Depot teams/factory reps/CFTs/NSOs and small/unique units shall adhere to
AF/Lead Command/Local guidance for tool control policies and procedures when working on
aerospace equipment possessed by the unit. The tool management program outlined in this
instruction represents AF minimum program requirements; Lead Commands may dictate
additional requirements.
10.2. Guidelines for Program Management.
   10.2.1. The MXG/CC (MXW/CC for ALC or equivalent functional authority for
   maintenance) is the OPR for the development of wing OIs for control and management of
   tools/equipment used on the flightline and aircraft/aerospace equipment maintenance
   industrial areas. As a minimum, guidance will address the following:
   10.2.1. (NASIC) 3 NASIC/GXF Composite Tool Kit (CTK) custodian in coordination with
   the supply section will retain warranted tool receipts and documentation in the event
   warranty repair is required. Tools turned in damaged or broken will have the equipment
   identification designator removed, identified for warranty return eligibility and maintained as
   a broken tool until returned to manufacturer for repair or replacement.
       10.2.1.1. Standardized procedures for security, control, and accountability of tools and
       equipment to include weapons load crew crimpers, die, lead seals, and engine blade
       blending blue dye. Chits are not authorized.
       10.2.1.2. Inventory requirements. As a minimum, conduct and document an annual
       inventory of all tools and equipment.
       10.2.1.3. Procedures for warranted tool management.
       10.2.1.4. Procedures for control and management of replacement, expendable and
       consumable hand tools, HAZMATs, and other items contained in CTKs/TKs.
       10.2.1.4. (NASIC) Expendable tools such as apex bits and consumable tools such as
       safety wire spools, along with Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) items, with the exception
       of tooling with self-contained oil/HAZMATS, will be accounted for and will be turned in
       to the CTK custodian for proper disposal. All CTKs that have HAZMAT materials in
       them will have appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) inside the CTK
       10.2.1.5. Procedures for transfer of tools/CTKs/TKs at the job site (on-site transfers).
       CTKs/TKs are not normally passed from one individual to another at the job site;
       however, mission needs occasionally require this action to occur. Ensure tool
       accountability and control is maintained when transfer occurs between the individuals. As
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       185


     a minimum the individuals involved in the transfer will accomplish a joint inventory and
     document accordingly.
     10.2.1.5. (NASIC) Individuals involved with job site transfer of tools or equipment will
     conduct a joint inventory and document the transfer on AF Form 1297. After inventory is
     complete, hand-carry AF Form 1297 to the tool room and give it to the CTK custodian.
     Tools and support equipment will not be kept out longer than normal shift operating
     hours unless extended operations are approved by Flt/CC or Production Superintendent.
     10.2.1.6. Procedures for lost or missing tools.
     10.2.1.7. Assignment of equipment identification designators (EID) for CTKs/TKs, non-
     CA/CRL equipment, and assignment of CTK/TK numbers for tools.
     10.2.1.8. Procedures for issue and control of PPE (e.g., ear protectors, reflective belts,
     headsets). Mark tools or equipment that a work center assigns/issues to individuals IAW
     Lead Command procedures.
     10.2.1.8. (NASIC) All issued personal protective equipment (i.e., ear defenders,
     headsets, reflective belts, goggles) will be either etched or permanently marked legibly
     with WEFME. The first two letters WE designate the wings personnel assignment system
     base code, FME identifies the unit and shop followed by four letters consisting of the first
     two letters of the users first and last name. Personal protective equipment not issued or
     controlled through CTK procedures are not authorized in the exploitation operations area.
     10.2.1.9. Procedures to ensure positive control of rags.
        10.2.1.9.1. A rag is defined as a remnant of cloth purchased in bulk or a standardized,
        commercial quality, vendor-supplied shop cloth used in general industrial, shop, and
        flightline operations. Cheesecloth is considered a rag, however, paper products/paper
        towels are not considered rags. Rags should be uniform in size and color.
        10.2.1.9.2. Marking or identifying each shop rag with a CTK number is not
        necessary. Issue and receipt procedures will be established to ensure positive control
        and accountability of each rag that leaves a CTK area. Some recommended methods
        of shop rag control include:
            10.2.1.9.2.1. Issuing rags on a one-for-one swap.
            10.2.1.9.2.2. Issuing a predetermined number of rags with CTKs and include
            them on the CTK contents listing.
            10.2.1.9.2.3. Issuing rags in pre-packaged containers with the number of rags
            marked on each container.
     10.2.1.10. Procedures to limit numbers of personnel authorized to procure tools.
     10.2.1.10. (NASIC) Personnel authorized to procure tools will be limited to officers,
     SNCOs and civilian equivalents as documented by the Flt/CC.
     10.2.1.11. Procedures for control of locally manufactured or developed tools and
     equipment.
     10.2.1.12. Procedures for depot teams, factory representatives, and CFTs when working

       10.2.1.13. Ensure standardized procedures and responsibilities are established when two
       or more AMUs/work centers operate out of the same tool room/support section, or when
       work centers elect to distribute CTKs/TKs or peculiar support/test equipment to
       decentralized locations.
       10.2.1.14. Procedures for control of CDDAR and hydrazine response equipment
       permanently stored/located in trailers or vehicles.
       10.2.1.15. Procedures for requiring a second party or on-duty supervisor inspection of
       CTKs/TKs when conditions warrant a single person shift. The same individual that signs
       out a CTK/TK cannot sign it back in.
       10.2.1.16. Procedures for controlled access to tool rooms.
       10.2.1.17. Procedures to control aircrew tools and AFE tool kits that are dispatchable to
       the flightline. Coordinate procedures through the Wing AFE Superintendent.
10.3. General Program Guidelines.
   10.3.1. The FLT CC/Chief (First line supervisor for ALC) will designate CTK/TK
   custodians in writing. CTK/TK custodians are responsible for tool, HAZMAT, and
   consumable asset accountability and control (EXCEPTION: a separate person may be
   designated as the HAZMAT monitor).
   10.3.2. Flight chiefs/section NCOICs (or equivalents) determine the type, size, contents and
   number of CTKs required for their work centers, this responsibility lies with the WWM for
   load crew CTKs. The WWM will approve/sign a single MIL to be used as the standard for all
   Load Crew CTKs on like mission-design-series aircraft; a copy will be maintained in each
   support section.
   10.3.3. Design CTK/TKs to provide a quick inventory and accountability of tools. Clearly
   mark all CTKs/TKs and tools with the EID (follow guidance below).
   10.3.4. CTK/TK contents will be standardized to the maximum extent possible within
   functional elements of a squadron that have similar missions (e.g., aircraft flights/sections
   and CASTs).
   10.3.5. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK/TK has an assigned
   location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, label, or
   silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools
   issued in sets such as drill bits, allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties).
   10.3.6. A Master Inventory List (MIL) Is required for each CTK or series of identical CTKs.
   NOTE: When Tool Accountability System (TAS) is used, the MIL resides in TAS, but a
   hard copy of the MIL must reside with each dispatchable CTK or series of identical kits.
   When items such as dispatchable support equipment or dispatchable special tools are issued
   separately and contain multiple parts, an inventory of the multiple items must be provided
   with the equipment or special tools. Units are required to electronically back up their
   respective database at least once a month. This backup must be kept separate from the
   computer that houses the tool control database.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      187


     10.3.6.1. For units not required to use TAS, contents are identified on the MIL by
     drawer/section indicating the number and type of each item in the CTK and total number
     of all items in each drawer/section.
     10.3.6.2. If identification tags or dust caps are attached to tools/equipment, they will be
     secured in a manner that will preclude any possibility of FOD. Locks and tie down
     strap(s), if not permanently attached, will be marked/etched with the appropriate CTK
     number. All items are listed on the MIL.
     10.3.6.3. Consumables may be placed in CTKs. If so, they are identified on the MIL as
     consumables. Examples of consumables include; safety wire, adhesive, wire bundle
     lacing, solder, etc. Do not include common hardware items such as bolts, nuts, and/or
     screws unless they are required as tools.
     10.3.6.4. Tool sets are identified on the MIL by total number of items in the set (e.g.,
     allen wrench set - 9 each allen wrenches + container for a total of 10).
     10.3.6.5. Document missing, removed and/or broken tools/items in TAS if they cannot
     be replaced immediately. In addition, for dispatchable CTKs and dispatchable support
     equipment/dispatchable special tools containing multiple parts, document the missing,
     removed and/or broken tools/items on a MAJCOM/locally generated form, or on the hard
     copy MIL. Pencil/pen may be used for hard copy MIL documentation and erased when
     cleared. Remove the EID from any permanently removed tool/item. A permanently
     removed (without planned replacement) tool/item constitutes a change to the inventory
     and requires a new MIL.
         10.3.6.5.1. If a MAJCOM/locally generated form is used, the form will be kept with
         each dispatchable CTK/dispatchable support equipment/dispatchable special tools as
         identified in para 10.3.6.
     10.3.6.6. The CTK/TK custodian has the authority to interchange "like" (form, fit,
     function)items.
  10.3.7. Equipment and accessories that do not present a FOD potential and will not leave the
  work center, support section, or tool room, need not be included in a CTK/TK; however, this
  equipment must have designated storage locations established. Designated locations may be
  work areas or stations
     10.3.7.1. Establish designated locations for test equipment and common accessories
     (e.g., waveguides, attenuators, fittings, cables, adapters) that are not part of a CTK/TK.
     As a minimum, designated locations will be labeled to identify the contents.
     10.3.7.2. Industrial shop machinery accessories/attachments (e.g., blades, arbors, chucks,
     gears) need not be controlled as tools; however, these items will be maintained in
     designated storage locations for accountability. As a minimum, storage cabinets/drawers
     will be labeled to identify the contents.
  10.3.8. Tools/expendable items used for titanium engine blade blending or oxygen system
  maintenance will be kept in special purpose kits separate from other tools. In addition to
  normal CTK/TK identification, these kits will be marked “For Titanium Engine Blade
  Blending Only”. For tools utilized in oxygen system maintenance, mark the kits with the
  following statement: “For Oxygen System Use Only”.
 188                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   10.3.9. Discard removable (e.g., slide on) pocket clips from tools when possible (flashlights,
   continuity testers, small screwdrivers, etc.) prior to placement in tool kits. Do not
   disassemble/damage tools for sole purpose of removing clips (e.g.. tape measures), rubber
   switch guards, etc.
   10.3.10. Tools not controlled through CTK/TK procedures are NOT authorized on the
   flightline, or in any maintenance area (e.g., personal; mini-mag flashlights, leathermans, buck
   knives, etc.). Lead Commands will develop procedures to mark and control equipment that a
   work center assigns/issues to an individual. Personally-purchased tools are not authorized.
   10.3.11. Flashlights, lanterns, portable lighting devices and light sources will conform to the
   requirements of TO 00-25-172 when used during servicing operations, TO 1-1-3 when used
   during fuel cell maintenance, and AFMAN 91-201 when used in explosive environments.
   NOTE: Aircraft and equipment TOs may dictate additional restrictions.
   10.3.12. For deployment purposes, ensure equipment, tools, and HAZMAT items are
   properly identified, prepared, and documented IAW AFI 10-403.
10.4. Tool Accountability. Flight commanders/chiefs and section NCOICs, (First level
supervisors/section chiefs for ALC) through CTK/TK custodians, are responsible for tool and
equipment accountability and control (knowing where tools are and who has responsibility for
them.) When a person signs for a tool or piece of equipment, they are accountable for the item
until it is returned to the tool room and accountability transfers back to the CTK/TK custodian
(through a representative or tool room employee.)
   10.4.1. All units must use TAS or Facility and Equipment Maintenance System (FEMS) for
   accountability and control of tools and equipment. Contractors and Civil Service
   Organizations/MEOs are not required to use TAS/FEMS. AFE Sections will follow guidance
   given in AFI 11-301, Volume 1.
   10.4.1. (NASIC) NASIC/GXF will use TCMax® as a primary means for accountability to
   track and control the location of tools (lost, damaged, spare) and equipment stored and
   issued. AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, will be used in the event TCMax® is
   unavailable.
       10.4.1.1. Units will use TAS to:
          10.4.1.1.1. Track the issuance and receipt of all assigned tools, equipment, tool kits,
          HAZMAT items, TOs (does not apply to TOs, equipment and HAZMAT kept in a
          shop and not dispatched.)
              10.4.1.1.1.1. Hazmat items issued for one time use (oil cans, hydraulic cans,
              mixing compounds) are supply items and do not have to be tracked in TAS.
              Hazmat and supply procedures must still be followed.
          10.4.1.1.2. Track    authorizations/restrictions   for   special   tools/equipment   (by
          individual)
          10.4.1.1.3. Track CTK and Support Section inspections as a minimum
          10.4.1.1.4. Track spare, lost, and damaged (removed) tools
          10.4.1.1.5. Develop and manage tool/equipment inventories
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       189


         10.4.1.1.6. Develop and manage deployment kits (import/export)
     10.4.1.2. If TAS/FEMS is not available (such as at a deployed location), units may use
     the AF IMT 1297, a Lead Command, or locally approved form for accountability and
     control of CTKs/TKs, equipment, and tools.
     10.4.1.3. Units that experience problems with the system should contact the 754th
     ELSG/ILMM at DSN 596-5771/Comm 334-416-5771 for assistance. However the
     decision has been made at HQAF level to no longer fund upgrades and repairs to TAS in
     preparation of the implementation of the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS)
     in FY12.
         10.4.1.3.1. The Air Force acknowledges the sustainment office may not be able to
         rectify all problems with TAS due to this lack of funding. The AF/A4L authorizes
         units to identify and justify an alternate automated tool tracking system for the
         interim until ECSS is made available as long as the following requirements are met:
             10.4.1.3.1.1. All provisions of subparagraphs to AFI 21-101 para 10.4.1.1 are
             met.
             10.4.1.3.1.2. The time frame required to acquire the alternate system is identified.
             10.4.1.3.1.3. Acquisition and sustainment costs are identified.
             10.4.1.3.1.4. System will be unit funded to include sustainment until ECSS
             implementation.
         10.4.1.3.2. The request and justification for an interim alternate tracking system will
         be approved through the Lead Command Functional and ECSS champion and
         formally submitted through the ECSS A4RB process.
         10.4.1.3.3. Upon ECSS implementation, all maintenance units will be required to use
         the ECSS tool control capability suite. This suite will replace TAS and any other
         remaining systems performing like functions. The system specifics have yet to be
         defined (embedded or bolt on to ECSS interface). If the transition from the locally
         chosen system (other than TAS) is not compatible with ECSS then the unit will be
         responsible for loading all required data into ECSS.
  10.4.2. Account for all CTKs/TKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment at the beginning and
  end of each shift. Shift inventories must be documented by both outgoing and incoming
  personnel. CTKs/TKS present during tool room shift inventories do not need to be opened
  for inventory.
  10.4.2. (NASIC) At the beginning of each shift NASIC/GXF will account for all test
  measurement diagnostic equipment (TMDE), individually issued tools, CTK keys and
  vehicle keys. This inventory will be annotated on the CAF 140. One hour prior to building
  lock up the CTK custodian will request that all tools, TMDE and keys be turned in. The CTK
  custodian is ultimately responsible for the turn in and inventory of all tools, equipment and
  keys signed out of the tool room. This end of shift inventory will be annotated on the CAF
  140.
     10.4.2.1. Perform a visual inventory of all CTKs/TKs when issued for use, at the
     completion of job or tasks, and when returned to the tool storage facility. Accomplish a
 190                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       CTK/TK inventory prior to operation of any aircraft or equipment when maintenance
       actions were performed (e.g., engine run, landing gear retraction, flight control
       operational checks.) NOTE: Upon returning to the work area after sheltering for real-
       world/exercise events an immediate and complete inventory of all CTKs/TKs will be
       conducted.
       10.4.2.2. At least annually or when the CTK/TK custodian changes, conduct a
       comprehensive inventory of all tools, non-CA/CRL equipment, and CTKs/TKs. The
       purpose of this inventory is to perform an extensive inspection of all tools and non-
       CA/CRL equipment, to include condition, identification markings, and accuracy of the
       MIL/TK/CRL Supplemental Listing. Inspect all tools for serviceability IAW TO 32-1-
       101. CTK/TK custodians document these inventories and maintain the most current
       inventory documentation on file.
   10.4.3. Electronic Tools (E-Tools). E-Tools (desktop and laptop computers, hand held
   devices, portable maintenance aids (PMA), etc.) are common infrastructure, allow access to
   logistics information systems, update TOs, provide automated change requests (similar to
   AFTO Form 22) and integrate with other Maintenance Information Systems (MIS).
   Workgroup managers shall monitor E-Tool configuration (operating system, virus checkers,
   etc.) IAW 33-series AFIs.
       10.4.3.1. E-Tools purchased and used for the purpose of viewing digital technical data
       and/or for maintenance documentation must be accounted for as automated data
       processing equipment (ADPE) IAW 33-series AFI's and tracked in TAS. E-tools
       designed specifically for a weapon system (e.g., F-22 PMA) will be accounted for on an
       equipment account (CA/CRL) and tracked in TAS/FEMS.
       10.4.3.2. Licenses, certification, maintenance and security of E-Tools (hardware and
       software) must also be IAW 33-series AFIs and AFI 21-116. Units must make maximum
       use of E-Tool warranties and ensure only serviceable E-Tools with charged batteries, up
       to date system software, and current technical data are available for checkout.
       10.4.3.3. IAW 33-series AFIs, E-Tools are for official use and authorized purposes only.
       Their primary purpose is to view digitized tech data, but may be used for other official
       uses. Lead Commands will establish policy for use of E-Tools for purposes other than
       viewing digitized tech data and maintenance documentation. GP CCs will establish
       procedures to ensure sufficient E-Tool availability for technical order viewing.
       10.4.3.4. TODO's may not have a traditional role in managing tech data when technical
       data management is accomplished by another agency (i.e., the manufacturer).
       10.4.3.5. The Lead TODO(s) shall work with other TODOs and TODAs (and
       CSAs/FSAs if required) to ensure E-Tools are configured with current software to
       support TO and maintenance documentation.
10.5. Tool and Equipment Marking and Identification.
   10.5.1. All units (ALCs see Para 10.5.7) must mark their tools and equipment with the
   standard EID and utilize the AF-approved TAS/FEMS (ANG, Contractors and Civil Service
   Organizations/MEOs are authorized to use a computerized system other than TAS/FEMS).
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                          191


  Geographically separated units may use the parent wing EID. Replacement spare tools stored
  in the tool crib do not need to be etched until placement in a specific CTK.
     10.5.1.1. The EID will consist of nine characters (numbers/letters) of which the first four
     characters will be a unique World Wide Identification (WWID) code. NOTE: The intent
     is for the four characters of the WWID to identify the base (first and second character),
     unit (third character), and shop (fourth character) in order to leave the remaining five
     characters available for tool/CTK equipment numbering.
     10.5.1.1. (NASIC) CTKs will be numbered with the nine digit identification designator.
     The first two digits (WE) are defined by the personnel assignment system (PAS) base
     code. The next three digits (FME) identify the unit and squadron.
         10.5.1.1.1. The first two characters of the WWID in the EID are based on the
         wing’s/unit’s personnel assignment system (PAS) base code. Multiple wings (or
         equivalent) at the same base (i.e., ANG, AFRC, and active duty) must have different
         WWID codes. When needed, request additional “base” codes from HQ 754
         ELSG/ILM, Gunter Annex, Maxwell AFB, AL.
         10.5.1.1.2. The third and fourth characters designate the unit and shop by using
         unique/distinguishable characters. To ensure tool rooms have unique identifiers,
         wings (or equivalent) must ensure other units within the same wing or PAS code do
         not duplicate the first 4 characters of the EID.
     10.5.1.2. The unit establishes the remaining five characters (any combination of
     numbers/letters) for CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment identification.
     10.5.1.3. Units must place the 9-digit EID on all CTKs, tools not assigned to a box, and
     dispatch-able equipment that is of sufficient size. The 9-digit EID must be placed on the
     outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box may be marked with less
     than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit WWID and identifying character(s) that ties the
     tool back to the CTK. For example, tools inside an assigned dispatchable CTK
     “U6JG00001” may be marked “U6JG1.” Units may affix non-metallic bar code labels on
     tools to prevent re-etching as long as the use of the tool and its work environment does
     not normally result in excessive damage to the label making it unreadable. Tools will be
     marked with the most current EID. All previous CTK identifiers will either be removed
     or marked out (this does not include PMEL markings).
         10.5.1.3.1. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above (such as
         drill bits, allen wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container marked
         with the WWID and an identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the CTK
         along with the number of tools contained. The container is counted as one of the
         items.
     10.5.1.4. MXG/CCs may require use of the EID and AFTO Form 65 (metallic)/AFTO
     Form 66 (non-metallic) for TMDE routinely (i.e., once per week) dispatched from a
     workcenter or use of the AFTO Form 65/66 alone. For items that physically or
     mechanically check tolerances that require calibration, do not etch, or stamp in any
     manner that will affect calibration or the ability to calibrate. If marking is in question, the
     owning workcenter shall consult PMEL.
 192                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   10.5.2. Permanently mark (by etching or other means) grease guns, dispensing cans, spray
   bottles, pump oilers, and similar containers with the type of grease, fluid, or other liquids and
   military specification (MILSPEC) of the contents. If no MILSPEC exists, mark the item with
   the manufacturer’s name, part number/NSN from the applicable MSDS. Keep hoses and
   fittings separate for each type of grease. NOTE: If containers are used to hold or apply
   substances classified as hazardous materials, ensure labeling requirements of AFI 90-821, 29
   CFR 1910.1200(f), and local directives are accomplished.
   10.5.3. Fiberglass handled hammers are etched IAW TO 32-1-101.
   10.5.4. CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment that may possess a unique serial/tracking
   number must be marked with an EID number. If the item cannot be marked, etched, or
   stamped, annotate the additional designator on the CTK contents list. TMDE will be marked
   with an EID and/or AFTO Form 65/66 bar code number for tracking purposes in TAS.
   10.5.5. Items that are assembled and are not intended to be disassembled during use, require
   only one mark/etch/stamp and one entry in the MIL (e.g., scribes, flashlights, grease guns,
   feeler gauges).
   10.5.6. Remove the EID from unserviceable tools and tools removed from the CTK (with the
   exception of warranty tools where removal of EID would void the tool warranty) and update
   TAS and the MAJCOM/locally generated form or hard copy MIL accordingly. Procedures to
   tag/segregate unserviceable warranty tools will be addressed IAW para 10.2.1.3.
   10.5.6. (NASIC) CTK custodian will secure all broken tools in a controlled, lockable area
   until they are processed for disposal. Ensure all equipment identification designators are
   completely removed from broken tools prior to disposal. CTK custodians will document all
   removed/broken CTK items on the MIL and in TCMax®.
   10.5.7. For ALC: Tools, common accessories, support equipment and CA/CRL equipment
   issued individually or part of a tool kit will be marked prior to issue with the center code (see
   Table 10.1) and a number identifying it to the proper tool issue center, Production Support
   Center (PSC) or back shop. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above
   (such as drill bits, allen wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container marked
   with the TK ID number and an identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the TK along
   with the number of tools contained. The container is counted as one of the items.

10.6. Locally Manufactured, Developed, or Modified Tools and Equipment. All locally
manufactured, developed, or modified tools and equipment used on aerospace equipment must
be approved by the MXG/CC (Planning and Engineering Office for ALC) or their designated
representative. This procedure does not apply to local manufacture, modification or design of
tools authorized in specific technical data. QA coordinates on all requests for approval and use of
locally designed tools or equipment. Users will review items and requirements biennially (every
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     193


two years) for applicability and current configuration. See Chapter 8 of this instruction for
additional guidance. NOTE: Weapons loading, maintenance and armament systems flight locally
designed equipment must be coordinated through the WWM and meet the following
requirements.
10.6. (NASIC)Locally Manufactured, Developed, or Modified Tools and Equipment
(LME). All locally manufactured, developed, or modified tools and equipment used on
aerospace equipment must be approved by the GXF/CC or designated representative. Users will
review items and requirements biennially (every two years) for applicability and current
configuration.
   10.6.1. LME, if not included in tech data or listed on the MMHE Focal Point web site
   (https://peonet.eglin.af.mil/mmhe/) managed by the MMHE Focal Point, 615 Apalachicola
   Road, Suite 101, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6845.
       10.6.1.1. Munitions/armament LME is specialized equipment designed to interface with
       or support munitions or armament suspension equipment such as tools, handling dollies,
       storage racks, maintenance stands, transport adapters, etc. All munitions/armament LME
       contained on the MMHE Focal Point web site meets applicable AFOSH, explosive
       safety, and USAF standards, and is approved for local manufacture and use at unit level
       AF-wide. Drawing packages for these items are available to the unit via the MMHE
       Focal Point web site. Units must use MMHE Focal Point-designed munitions/armament
       LME for new procurements if a design exists and fills the requirement.
       10.6.1.2. Munitions/armament LME, specifically designed to interface with or support
       munitions, which is not contained in technical data or on the MMHE Focal Point web site
       (i.e., hardened/protective aircraft shelter missile racks, Y-stands, munitions chocks,
       specialized tools, etc.) must be coordinated at unit level and forwarded to the MAJCOM
       Functional Manager for coordination/evaluation. If the MAJCOM Functional Manager
       determines the item has AF utility, the drawings shall be forwarded to the MMHE Focal
       Point for evaluation/ approval prior to formal development and placement onto the
       MMHE Focal Point web site. Munitions/armament LME, not designed to interface with
       or support munitions, which are not contained in technical data or on the MMHE Focal
       Point web site, must be approved at the unit level. Units are encouraged to forward any
       such approved LME for possible inclusion on MMHE Focal Point web site by sending an
       approved drawing package to the MAJCOM Functional Manager for
       coordination/evaluation. If the MAJCOM Functional Manager determines the item has
       additional AF utility, the drawing package shall be forwarded to the MMHE Focal Point
       for evaluation/approval prior to formal development and placement onto the MMHE
       Focal Point web site.
       10.6.1.3. All LME must meet applicable AFOSH, explosive safety, and USAF standards.
       All equipment designated for use with nuclear weapons test and handling must meet
       requirements in AFI 91-103.
       10.6.1.4. All LME must be maintained and inspected for serviceability on a regular basis
       IAW appropriate 00-20 series and 35D-1-2, Miscellaneous Munitions Handling and
       Support, technical data. AFTO IMT 244, or equivalent, must be maintained for all LME
       items (racks, stands, adapters, etc.). Equipment without technical data must, as a
 194                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       minimum, be inspected every 180 days for corrosion, physical defect, and lubrication as
       required.
   10.6.2. (Added-NASIC) NASIC/GXF LME includes but is not limited to locally
   manufactured data collection and transport systems as well as power conditioning equipment.
10.7. Tool Room Operations and Security. Limit tool issue sections to no more than one per
work center/AMU. Establish procedures to ensure custodial control. Set up tool rooms to ensure
accountability. Process reports for tools that are lost, damaged, or destroyed, due to neglect IAW
AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey For Air Force Property.
   10.7.1. The tool room/tool issue center/PSC must be capable of being locked and afford
   protective measures such as monitoring, 24-hour coverage, or controlled key access. Tool
   issue center/PSC supervisor authorizes access to tool rooms for ALC only. When all
   CTKs/TKs are not capable of being secured in the tool room/tool issue center/PSC, the
   section NCOIC/Tool issue center/PSC supervisor will design a process to prevent the
   unauthorized use or access to tools and equipment. Due to space and facility limitations, it
   may not be possible to store oversized tool kits in the tool room/tool issue center/PSC.
   10.7.1. (NASIC) Only authorized personnel designated in writing by the Flt/CC will be able
   to gain unescorted entry into tool room. During normal duty hours, the Chief Engineer,
   production superintendent and the CTK Custodian will have keyed access to the tool room.
       10.7.1.1. Tool kit locks will be used to provide a physical barrier to opening the
       container lid, drawer or door and prevent the unauthorized removal of tools. Locks are
       not required on tools and equipment that are stored within secured tool rooms or work
       centers.
       10.7.1.2. Dispatchable tools, equipment, and CTKs/TKs are required to be locked and/or
       secured when left unattended. Tools and equipment are never secured to the exterior of
       an aircraft. Tool kits located within the controlled movement area are required to be
       locked when unattended and not in use, but do not need to be secured to another object.
           10.7.1.2.1. Alert aircraft in protection level 1 or 2 areas and ASA aircraft in PL-3
           areas: CTKs in these areas directly supporting alert aircraft do not have to be locked
           when unattended and not in use as long as they are inventoried at the beginning of
           each shift, after each maintenance task, and at the end of each shift.
       10.7.1.3. Modifications to tool containers are authorized unless modification voids the
       manufacturer’s warranty.
       10.7.1.4. CTK/Tool issue centers/PSCs will not issue tools individually from
       dispatchable CTK/TKs. When a recurring need exists for common tools to be issued
       individually, e.g., hammers, screwdrivers, pliers, drills, wrenches to perform routine,
       housekeeping or facility tasks within the work center, add the tools to a CTK/TK.
   10.7.2. (Added-NASIC) In areas such as back shops, where tools and equipment do not
   leave the shop area, it is permissible for one person to sign out a tool cabinet (such as a
   Stanley Vidmar or roll-away) and allow an entire work crew to use tools from that cabinet, as
   long as the person signing out the CTK is able to maintain positive control of the contents.
   The contents of the cabinet will be inventoried prior to any member of the work crew
   departing the work area or if the CTK is left unattended.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        195


10.8. Lost Item/Tool Procedures.
   10.8.1. Supervisors ensure all assigned personnel are familiar with lost tool procedures. If an
   item/ tool or a portion of a broken tool is discovered missing, the following procedures apply:
      10.8.1.1. The person identifying the missing item/tool will search the immediate work
      area for the item/tool. If not found, after completing an initial search the individual will
      notify the expediter/ production superintendent/(First line supervisor for ALC) or
      equivalent.
      10.8.1.1. (NASIC) Within NASIC facilities, the person identifying the missing item/tool
      will search the immediate work area for the item/tool. If not found after the initial search
      the individual will report the missing item/tool to their supervisor and the CTK
      Custodian. The supervisor will determine if other work centers or staff agencies should
      be notified and will direct additional efforts to find the missing item/tool.
      10.8.1.2. Place a Red X in the aircraft or equipment forms of all affected aircraft or
      equipment with a description of the tool and a specific, last known, location of the tool.
          10.8.1.2.1. Aircraft/Equipment thought to contain a lost tool/item during the program
          depot maintenance process will be documented by initiating a Work Control
          Document and transferred to the aircraft forms as a Red X discrepancy at the point
          when the AFTO Form/IMT 781 or equipment forms are re-initiated
      10.8.1.3. Expediter/Production Superintendent/(First line supervisor for ALC) or
      equivalent will immediately notify the FLT CC/ Chief, support section, MOC, and QA.
      (Sq/CC and PSC Supervisor Center Tool Manager, Maintenance Control and QA for
      ALC).
      10.8.1.4. Initiate a thorough search for the tool.
      10.8.1.4. (NASIC) NASIC/GXFO FLT/CC will put together a team and initiate an in-
      depth search over the area where the tool was last seen.
      10.8.1.5. After a thorough search is completed and the tool is not found, the person
      issued the item/tool will initiate a lost tool report.
      10.8.1.5. (NASIC) If the tool is not found within one hour of searching, initiate a lost
      tool investigation report using CAF Form 145, Lost Tool/Object Report.
      10.8.1.6. If at any time during the investigation the item/tool is found and retrieved,
      notify the FLT CC/Chief, support section, MOC, QA, expediter, Production
      Superintendent or equivalent, and the owning work center. (Maintenance SQ/CC and
      PSC Supervisor (if applicable) Center Tool Manager, Maintenance Control, QA, First
      Line Supervisor, or equivalent and the owning workcenter for ALC)
      10.8.1.7. If not found, the MOC/Maintenance Control will notify the MXG/CC
      (MXW/CC for ALC) of the missing item/tool.
      10.8.1.7. (NASIC) If not found, the FLT/CC will notify the SQ/CC of the missing
      item/tool. The SQ/CC will determine when the search may be discontinued.
196                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      10.8.1.8. If the item is not located, MOO/MX SUPT (MX SQ/CC for ALC) shall
      determine when the search may be discontinued. Ensure documentation is accomplished
      IAW paragraph 10.3.6.5 of this instruction.
         10.8.1.8.1. Limit authorization to clear Red X’s when a tool/item cannot be located
         to no lower than MOO/MX SUPT (MX SQ/CC or Deputy for ALC).
      10.8.1.9. When it is suspected that the item/tool has fallen into an inaccessible or
      unobservable aircraft area, perform a NDI or use borescope equipment to locate the lost
      tool.
         10.8.1.9.1. If the item/tool is in an inaccessible area that poses no FOD threat and the
         action is to leave the item/tool in place, the x-ray (or equivalent) with the
         identification of the exact tool location and copies of all information concerning the
         lost tool are maintained in the aircraft historical file until the item/tool is recovered.
      10.8.1.10. If at any time during the investigation the item/tool is found, but is
      inaccessible, notify the FLT CC/Chief, support section, MOC, QA, expediter, Production
      Superintendent or equivalent, and the owning work center (Maintenance SQ/CC and
      Center Tool Manager, Maintenance Control, QA, First Line Supervisor, or equivalent and
      the owning workcenter for ALC).
         10.8.1.10.1. Operations Officer/MX SUPT may explore other possible actions to
         include having the unit or a DFT disassemble the aircraft to remove the item/tool.
         10.8.1.10.2. If the aircraft MDS is one that has a PDM or is scheduled for depot
         modification, the lost item/tool and location is listed in the AFTO IMT 345,
         Aerospace Vehicle Transfer Inspection Checklist and Certification, for removal by
         the depot.
  10.8.2. (Added-NASIC) If the missing item/tool is suspected to be on an aircraft, or when
  the possibility exists that the tool was lost outside NASIC facilities, report missing tools to
  the appropriate supervisor, 445 Airlift Wing MOC, and 445 Airlift Wing QA as soon as the
  loss is known and follow the lost tool procedures IAW 445AW 21-104.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         197


                                           Chapter 11

                            MAINTENANCE SUPPLY SUPPORT

11.1. General. This chapter describes the general responsibilities and requirements of
decentralized supply support personnel, Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL), AMU maintenance
Supply Support and work center supply management personnel. Lead Commands will identify
specific responsibilities and outline unique decentralized supply support operations in Lead
Command instructions when necessary. AF Program Action Directive (PAD) 08-01 makes the
establishment of MSLs a Lead Command option. AFMAN 23-110, provides supply policy and
procedures. Decentralized supply support personnel and MSL will follow the guidance outlined
in AFMAN 23-110. NOTE: The AF has transitioned to a Global Logistics Support Center
(GLSC) concept. The GLSC provides fleet wide supply support to all AF weapon systems and
leverages consolidated repair facilities and ALC capability to optimize air frame availability.
11.2. Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL) Section. The MSL monitors the overall
maintenance and supply interface, resolves supply support problems, review reports and
coordinates supply related training needs for decentralized supply support personnel. MSL
personnel are authorized on the LRS UMD and report to the LRS/CC. MXG/CC with the
MSG/CC may decentralize the MSL capability to physically reside with MXG. The LRS/CC
through the MSL, is the liaison between maintenance units and the AFGLSC. If Lead Commands
do not establish the MSL function, the LRS, Materiel Management Flight, Customer Support
Section, will accomplish MSL duties. (See AFMAN 23-110 Vol 2 Chapter 2 for further
instructions)
11.3. Decentralized supply support. The LRS/CC is responsible for providing supply support
to maintenance activities and will decentralize supply personnel and parts to the maximum extent
possible. Decentralized supply support personnel are authorized on the MXG UMD and report to
maintenance activities. These personnel coordinate maintenance and supply actions, manage
supply transactions for their assigned maintenance activity, monitor and track assets in the repair
cycle, resolve supply support problems and report aircraft parts status to maintenance
supervision. They assist maintenance in processing requisitions, researching sources of supply,
completing DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document, entering
manual requisitions (part number only), updating exception code lists, and other peculiar
maintenance supply problems.
   11.3.1. Supply Discipline. Supply discipline is the responsibility of all military and civilian
   employees regardless of grade or position. Supervisors at all levels ensure the practice of
   good supply discipline. Train all maintenance personnel to perform supply duties related to
   their job to include AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the
   Air Force, guidance.
11.4. Ordering Parts. Order aircraft parts from supply through MIS/ILS-S interface. Monitor
supply status on all backordered parts. To minimize records discrepancies, initiate
orders/backorders for all parts through the appropriate MIS when an interface with Standard
Base Supply System exists and all data elements are properly configured. Request supply
assistance if status is unacceptable. Technicians ordering parts:
   11.4.1. Provide required data to facilitate the issue request. See AFMAN 23-110.
 198                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   11.4.2. Complete AF Form 2413 or AF IMT 2005, Issue Turn-In Request or locally
   developed electronic log, and include the supply document number and time ordered, or use
   printouts of requests made via the supply interface in lieu of AF Form 2413 or AF IMT 2005
   or locally developed electronic log.
   11.4.3. Order parts for transient aircraft IAW AFMAN 23-110 and TO 00-20-1,. Use
   demand code "N" (non-recurring) for transient aircraft requests. Use demand code "R"
   (recurring) if the item is for a base assigned aircraft or for regularly scheduled transient
   flights.
       11.4.3.1. Promptly process repairable items since the repairable item may be the only
       part available.
       11.4.3.2. Assign a valid supply delivery priority to each demand IAW AFMAN 23-110 .
       11.4.3.3. Cancel erroneous requests.
       11.4.3.4. Use the force activity designators (FAD) code with the UND to set the
       requisition priority. When supporting a unit with a higher FAD, use the FAD of the
       supported unit.
       11.4.3.5. Ensure proper use of UJCs.
       11.4.3.6. Verify and monitor backordered requests to prevent unwarranted mission
       limiting conditions, CANNs, priority abuses and wasted money.
       11.4.3.7. Recycle reusable containers and metals.
       11.4.3.8. Turn in excess supply parts and materiel.
       11.4.3.9. Process TRN to record usage of an item and ensure proper stockage.
       11.4.3.10. Track DIFMs. DIFM inputs are critical to recording and getting credit for
       proper repair cycle times. DIFM status codes are currently broken down into three
       categories; delayed maintenance time, repair time, and AWP time. Repair time is the only
       time recorded and used to determine the number of assets LRS can stock. Not using the
       proper codes when they change, reduces the number of assets on base. DIFMs should be
       reduced to as near zero as possible since credit is not given for delayed maintenance or
       AWP time.
       11.4.3.11. Ensure the SPD approves the local purchase of all aircraft parts. Purchase
       aircraft parts IAW AFI 64-117.
11.5. Processing. Process the MICAP start in Mission Capable Asset Sourcing System
(Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S)) and coordinate with the MSL to upgrade, downgrade and
cancel MICAP requirements.
11.6. Readiness Spares Package (RSP) Review. Maintainers have a critical role in the annual
RSP review process. This role includes active maintenance participation in the base level
validation process conducted by the LRS and their MAJCOM during the annual RSP pre-review
process in preparation for the ALC/SPD final review. Close maintenance-supply collaboration is
essential to ensure RSPs are properly sized to support contingency maintenance requirements.
11.7. Bench Stock. Work center supervisors determine the contents of their bench stock.
Examples of bench stock items include: nuts, bolts, cotter keys, washers, resistors, capacitors,
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         199


light bulbs, sealants and batteries. Bench stock levels are managed and based predominantly on
consumption. See AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chapter 11 for specific requirements for
managing bench stock levels.
   11.7.1. Mark bins containing 50 percent or less of the authorized quantity to facilitate
   monthly inventories. Do not include items coded TCTO, unacceptable for AF use, critical,
   classified or sensitive in bench stocks. Refer to AFMAN 23-110 for exception data.
   11.7.2. Maintain environmentally sensitive items in their original container. If removed from
   original container, place items in a sealed package and clearly mark them to prevent
   misidentification and misuse (e.g., seals, desiccant, filters, circuit cards, sealants).
   11.7.3. Remove unidentifiable items, or items whose serviceability is unknown, from bench
   stock bins and process them as shop scrap through DRMO.
   11.7.4. Control and secure any precious metals displayed. Dispose of property containing
   precious metals IAW AFMAN 23-110.
   11.7.5. Set up fixed or mobile bench stocks to provide quick and easy access to bits and
   pieces needed to support maintenance efforts. Ensure mobile bench stocks do not present a
   FOD hazard.
   11.7.6. Identify and control the issue and turn-in of hazardous materiel/items on bench stock
   listings.
11.8. Consumable Readiness Spares Package (CRSP). The CRSP concept allows MAJCOMs
to use either Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) or In-place Readiness Spares Package
(IRSP) details to manage consumable item support for contingency deployments. The CRSP
process provides requirement and asset visibility, has automated transfer and deployment
procedures, has the capability to provide the correct priority and project-coded replenishment
requisitions, and eliminates redundant requirements. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2,
Chapter 26 for detailed CRSP procedures and options. The CRSP procedures provide
MAJCOMs with a standard process to support consumable item wartime requirements.
11.9. Shop Stock. Includes gas cylinders, random length bar stock, sheet metal, plastic, fabric,
electrical wire, and similar items not normally included in bench stocks. Maintain shop stock for
day-to-day operations. Monitor shop stock to prevent materials from becoming excessive or
outdated. Shop stock should not normally exceed 90 days usage, or the unit of issue or unit pack,
whichever is greater. Store shop stock near/adjacent to bench stock items, if practical, but do not
mix them together. Clearly identify materials as “Shop Stock” and label them with noun, national
stock number or part number, unit of issue, and shelf-life, if applicable.
11.10. Operating Stock. Includes connector dust covers, hydraulic line caps/plugs, and similar
items that are normally recovered after use and re-used. Store operating stock near/adjacent to
bench stock items, if practical, but do not mix them together. Monitor operating stock to prevent
it from becoming excessive or outdated. Retain partially used bench stock items in bench stock
and not in operating stock. Identify, tag, and turn in items with no forecasted use IAW AFMAN
23-110. Clearly identify items as “Operating Stock” and label them with noun, national stock
number or part number (if applicable), unit of issue, and shelf-life, if applicable.
11.11. Work Order Residue. Includes expendable bit/piece items left over from maintenance
work orders or bench stock deletions. Store work order residue near/adjacent to bench stock
 200                                              AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


items, if practical, but do not mix them together. Ensure excesses are consolidated for turn-in to
LRS at least annually. Clearly identify items as “Work Order Residue” and label them with
noun, national stock number or part number, unit of issue, and shelf-life, if applicable. Control
all work order residues used on or around aircraft, uninstalled engines, and AGE.
11.12. Adjusted Stock Levels. Adjusted levels are used when the demand level or consumption
is inadequate to support the requirement. A single occurrence of a mission limiting status is not
sufficient reason to establish an adjusted stock level. It may indicate a need to review demand
data for accuracy. Use AF IMT 1996, Adjusted Stock Level, to request adjusted supply levels for
support of special projects, special operating requirements, or if existing demand data is
insufficient to support mission requirements. Work centers, with assistance from supply
personnel, must prepare the AF IMT 1996 and route it through MOO/MX SUPT for review prior
to sending to LRS Customer Service Section. See AFMAN 23-110 for criteria and procedures to
submit these requests. Prior to submitting to LRS, ensure the AF IMT 1996 contains adequate
justification and is approved by the MXG/CC. Examples of adequate justification include:
seasonal materiel requirements, long lead-time items, unserviceable components forcing a “no
fly” or NMC condition for extended periods of time and fleet-wide versus single aircraft impacts.
Work centers must maintain a master file of adjusted stock levels and must follow-up on
requests. Supply personnel and the appropriate work center must accomplish a validation of
adjusted stock levels according to AFMAN 23-110.
11.13. Shelf life Items. Work centers control shelf life items in bench stock, operating/shop
stock and work order residue IAW AFMAN 23-110. LRS identifies shelf life items by use of
shelf life codes; units will identify shelf life in bench, shop, operating stocks and work order
residue by using colored/highlighted bin labels. This label contains the item's shelf life code and
source of the code. Contact the LRS supply inspector to determine if shelf life conflicts exist
between the various sources. Check expiration dates on issued items and do not accept outdated
items from supply. Do not open shelf life containers until needed and use the oldest items first.
Shelf life materials stored in other than original containers must be marked with original shelf-
life expiration codes. Recycle, reclaim, or turn-in for disposal, shelf life items which are loose in
the bin and expiration dates cannot be determined IAW Type I shelf life criteria IAW AFMAN
23-110. Inspect Type II shelf life items IAW AFMAN 23-110.
11.14. Equipment Items. Continually review equipment items needed for mission
accomplishment. LRS personnel assist equipment custodians in researching and preparing
documents for gaining authorizations and ordering equipment items. Equipment custodians
request equipment, tools and bench mock-ups, using AF IMT 601, Equipment Action Request, or
AF IMT 2005. LRS provides equipment custodians a CA/CRL listing all authorized and in-use
equipment for each account. Check the appropriate Allowance Standard for authorizations, and
verify that the correct SRDs are loaded. See AFMAN 23-110 for procedures on appointing
equipment custodians, setting up the proper accounts, ordering, and maintaining equipment
items. Organizational equipment custodians must work through LRS to obtain a loan agreement
from the Command Equipment Management Office prior to loaning organizational equipment to
another installation IAW AFMAN 23-110. Accountable equipment custodians must notify LRS
Equipment Accountability Office of deploying or scheduled to deploy equipment IAW AFMAN
23-110. Ensure compliance with capitalized equipment procedures IAW AFMAN 23-110.
11.15. Special Purpose Recoverable Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM). SPRAM assets are
fault isolation spares, shop standard spares, training spares, Dash-21 TO spares (AME), test
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                          201


station spares, and stand alone spares. These assets are Expendability, Recoverability,
Repairability Code (ERRC) XD/XF items, which are controlled and managed as in-use supplies.
Review all SPRAM authorizations annually and certify as valid. Annotate review on the R25
listing. A SPRAM monitor and custodian are appointed to manage these assets. The program was
developed to provide AF maintenance leaders an automated system to maintain visibility and
accountability for recoverable spares being used for other than their primary mission and that are
not being reported through any other system. (Ref: AFMAN 23-110 and AFI 21-103).
11.16. Supply Assets Requiring Functional Check, Calibration, or Operational Flight
Programming. Maintenance sections must identify items requiring functional checks,
calibration, or operational flight programming prior to use by preparing a list of items, (including
the repair section's organization and section code) and sending the list through the Flight/CC or
flight/section NCOIC or AMU OIC/SUPT (if applicable) and MOO/MX SUPT to the LRS chief
inspector. This list shall be updated/ validated IAW AFMAN 23-110. Supply issues the items
using procedures in AFMAN 23-110 to repair sections when functional checks, calibration, or
programming is due or when serviceability is doubtful. If a part issues requiring a functional
check, ensure it is not restricted in the weapon system Dash-6 TO. Do not use an aircraft as a test
bed for parts. Refer to TO 00-20-3 for functional check and frequency requirements.
11.17. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kit Procedures. TCTO kit management
is a joint maintenance and supply responsibility IAW TO 00-5-15 and AFMAN 23-110. TCTO
managing agencies initiate requests for kits, parts and tool requirements (See Chapter 7 of this
instruction for additional information). Transfer TCTO kits with aircraft or equipment. Retain
TCTO kits for aircraft returning to the unit for TCTO compliance. AFMAN 23-110, TO 00-5-15,
and TO 00-5-1 contain detailed guidance for the transfer of TCTO kits.
11.18. Supply Points. Establish supply points within individual work centers when time or
resources required to move items dictate a need. Storage space for the supply points is provided
by the supported work center. Determine management of the supply point by agreement between
the group commanders. Supply points must be reconciled semi-annually by the work center
supply point monitor and the results of the reconciliation are provided to the LRS Supply Point
Manager. Supply points are inventoried annually IAW AFMAN 23-110. Establishment of an
aircraft parts store and/or FSC within the maintenance complex reduces the dependence on
supply points and or bench stocks. LRS maintains warehouses in both these facilities, stocking
assets closer to the point of use. Expenditure of funds and manpower may be reduced by use of
these facilities.
11.19. Local Manufacture. Units publish directives outlining procedures covering the
manufacture of items source coded local manufacture. Include procedures that prevent abuses,
specify coordination requirements (e.g., QA) and approval authority. Local manufacturing is an
essential part of unit maintenance support. The applicable end-item TO identifies items subject to
local manufacture. Specific procedures are in AFMAN 23-110. When developing directives:
   11.19.1. Identify the approval authority for local manufacture requests.
   11.19.2. Requesters use an AF IMT 2005 for supply item local requests. Use an AF IMT 601
   for equipment requests. Provide a drawing, sample, technical data and DD Form 1348-6, as
   required. Obtain drawings from the primary EDSC or Joint Engineering Data Management
   Information and Control System (JEDMICS) IAW AFI 63-101.
 202                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   11.19.3. Requesters coordinate with the appropriate fabricating section to determine the bits
   and pieces required to manufacture the item. The supply local manufacturer manager assists
   in verifying parts availability.
   11.19.4. Requesters identify all sections that have action on the AFTO Form 350 for items
   requiring multiple section processing.
11.20. Production Scheduling. The repair section NCOICs establish a production schedule
based on priorities. LRS provides the repair cycle asset management listing (D23) to assist each
repair section in this effort. The D23 is provided in both maintenance location and stock number
sequence. Repair sections use the D23 to manage the flow of unserviceable DIFM assets in the
repair cycle and to ensure the DIFM status and location is updated.
11.21. Control of AWP Assets and Cross-CANN. Closely control reparable assets in AWP
status. Do not consolidate storage areas for AWM and AWP assets. Group commanders
negotiate storage of out-sized units. Provide the supply AWP manager the DIFM document
number of the AWP end item and the due-out document numbers of bits and pieces to adjust
supply data base records for cross-CANN actions. Supply requisitions, and monitors the status of
repair bits and pieces. Repair section asset managers identify unacceptable supply status impacts
to the LRS AWP Monitor. Supply requests disposition for assets with unavailable repair parts.
Only dispose of parts on receipt of disposition authority.
11.22. Repair Cycle Assets. Decentralized Supply Support (DSS) personnel will monitor the
status of repair cycle assets. Process repair cycle assets and ensure appropriate DIFM Status
codes are used IAW TO 00-20-3. Units establish local procedures for the control of repair cycle
assets throughout the maintenance cycle. Include methods of accounting for all components and
accessories, procedures for control of assets in AWP or AWM status, and procedures and
responsibilities for cross CANN, removal of bits and pieces, and scheduling and control of repair
cycle assets. Promptly process, repair, and return repairable components to the repair cycle
support element within the required time frame IAW this publication, paragraph 11.34.1.1.9.
Repair assets to the fullest extent authorized within unit capabilities.
11.23. DIFM. Repair sections use the D23 to manage the flow of unserviceable DIFM assets in
the repair cycle and to update DIFM status and location of unserviceable assets. If a parts request
is backordered and the unserviceable DIFM item does not limit or restrict the operational
capability of the end item, remove it and send it to the applicable support section for either
repair, NRTS approval, or condemnation with a subsequent turn-in to LRS (as a credit DIFM)
IAW TO 00-20-3. The D23 will not be used to manage serviceable assets.
11.24. Tail Number Bins (TNB). Establishment and management of TNBs is a maintenance
responsibility. TNBs are storage locations established and controlled to store issued parts
awaiting installation and parts removed to FOM. TNBs are set up by tail number, serial number,
or identification number. Once the part is issued, the aircraft parts store informs the MOC and
Flightline expediter (for MICAPs) or the PS&D (for backordered items) that the part is in. Do
not release parts from the TNB without proper documentation. Return items removed from the
TNB that are not installed that duty day. Inform the Production Superintendent or Flightline
expediter of TNB assets, which may prevent or satisfy a mission-limiting condition. TNB items
used to satisfy MICAP conditions are not CANNs. Reorder these items and notify the expediter
of the new document number. Update the aircraft forms and the MIS. If supply creates a due-out
prior to transfer of these items, notify decentralized supply support to change the "mark-for" field
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        203


on the due-out detail. Seal and store partially completed TCTO kits and parts in the TNB and
mark the container or package with the tail number, serial number, or equipment identification
number and TCTO number. Maintain security and control of TNB assets. Track property placed
in the TNB by tail number, serial number, or equipment identification number. For each entry
indicate:
   11.24.1. Date received
   11.24.2. Noun
   11.24.3. Document number
   11.24.4. Status (FOM, issue/due-out release (ISU/DOR), TCTO, etc.)
   11.24.5. Removal information (date, time, signature, and employee number of the person
   who picked up the property)
   11.24.6. Remarks
11.25. CANN actions. See section 14.8 for CANN procedures and responsibilities.
11.26. Bench Check and Repair Policy. Maintenance sections bench check items as part of
the on-equipment troubleshooting process. When workload requires, the section NCOIC
determines the priority for bench check actions. Specific procedures for bench check and repair
policy are provided in TO 00-20-3. The following general guidelines apply:
   11.26.1. Order required parts “fill or kill.” If the part is not in stock and a MICAP condition
   exists, backorder the new request. Determine local repair capability before requisitioning off-
   base support or going lateral support.
   11.26.2. Remove the suspected item, fill out the AFTO Form 350, and annotate it as repair
   and return. Attach AFTO Form 350 to the item; place the item in the repair cycle; and
   annotate the name of the repair section on the form.
   11.26.3. Bench-check, repair, take NRTS action, or condemn the item. If the item is repaired
   or otherwise determined to be serviceable, the repair section informs the support section the
   item is available for pick-up so on-equipment maintenance action may resume. If the item
   cannot be repaired, the repair section informs the support section to initiate a backordered
   request and takes appropriate NRTS and condemnation action on the unserviceable asset.
11.27. Maintenance Turn-Around (TRN) Record Update Processing. Work centers
processing TRNs will ensure the AFTO Form 350, Part II, is processed using the supply
interface to the MIS. Verify each TRN with the D04. Use TRN procedures for all items repaired
and replaced.
11.28. Maintenance Turn-In to Supply. Work centers must properly tag and secure repair
cycle assets and place items in a leak–proof containment liner (no leaks/stains/tears/punctures),
as required. To prevent spillage, any item containing any type of residual fluid, regardless of
hazard classification, will be drained, purged, preserved, capped, plugged and placed in a leak-
proof containment liner before placement into a serviceable reusable container for storage or
shipment. The work center must comply with packaging, environmental control, purge and
preservation requirements as specified in applicable TOs, AFI 24-203, AFMAN 24-204 and
place the proper documentation with the container. Include AFTO Form 350, Parts I and II, and
a condition tag or label with all items turned into supply. Enter the correct action taken code on
 204                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


AFTO Form 350, Part II. Accomplish proper reclamation and demilitarization actions on
condemned repair cycle assets IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 6 and 7.
11.29. Buildup Items. Maintain items requiring build-up prior to use (e.g., wheels and tires) in
supply points in a built-up configuration. Send items to appropriate work centers for build-up
and return them to the supply point for later issue. Use AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue
Receipt, or control log to control assets sent for build-up when the supply point is operated by
supply. Validate AF IMTs 1297 daily if over 10 days old. Establish local procedures to control
assets when maintenance operates the supply point and assets are sent to another organization for
build-up.
11.30. Supply Reports and Listings. Use supply reports and listings to manage maintenance
requirements. Most are provided automatically or generated after supply transactions. Request
others when needed. Attachment 2 of this instruction lists the most common/important reports
and listings.
11.31. Deficiency Report (DR) Exhibits. DR exhibit procedures for issue, turn-in, and storage
are contained in TO 00-35D-54 and AFMAN 23-110. They shall be input into the Joint
Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS) at https://jdrs.mil.
11.32. Work Center Supply Management.
   11.32.1. Maintain AF Form 2413 or AF IMT 2005, or a locally developed electronic log
   recording all parts ordered from LRS and verify status with the daily document register
   (D04), Priority Monitor, Report (D18) and the monthly due-out validation listing (M30) or
   use printouts of requests made via the supply interface in lieu of an electronic log, AF IMT
   2005, or AF Form 2413.
   11.32.2. Maintain source document audit trail accountability for all demands on supply.
   Ensure validity and completeness of supply requisition forms. Verify "UJC" and "SRD"
   codes.
   11.32.3. Maintain MICAP records and initiate follow-up actions on MICAP requisitions.
   11.32.4. Follow-up with supply personnel to resolve AWP problems.
   11.32.5. Establish procedures for controlling cross-CANN of reparable assets to reduce
   AWP units.
   11.32.6. Process supply items requiring a buildup before issue in a timely manner.
   11.32.7. Compile a list of items requiring functional check or calibration prior to installation.
   Review and update the list IAW AFMAN 23-110.
   11.32.8. Manage aircraft systems and equipment under 3LM. Compile a list of direct NRTS
   items in coordination with maintenance squadron back shops and AFREP representative and
   provide it to LRS for inclusion in the master direct NRTS listing. Review and update at least
   semiannually.
   11.32.9. Establish a storage area for reusable containers. Consolidation with other work
   centers is authorized.
   11.32.10. Schedule and control all repair cycle assets through the repair flights based on
   priority assigned.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                          205


   11.32.11. Move repairable assets from work center to work center in an expedient manner.
   Ensure proper documentation, containers accompany and meet the required time frame IAW
   this publication, paragraph 11.34.1.1.9.
11.33. Maintenance Repair/Supply Delivery Priorities. Use the following to establish
maintenance repair priorities. Raising or lowering priorities will not necessarily require a
corresponding change in the supply delivery priority. The maintenance repair priority and the
supply delivery priority are normally identical. Use a less responsive supply delivery priority
when the need time or date for a part does not justify the delivery priority specified. Refer to AFI
24-301 chapter 7.
   11.33.1. Priority 1. Use for primary mission aircraft within 12 hours of a scheduled launch

   11.33.7. Priority 7. Used for spares excess to base requirements.
11.34. Intermediate Repair Enhancement Program (IREP). MXG/CC is the OPR for the
IREP program. IREP provides wing senior leadership a forum to evaluate current aircraft
weapons systems resource and support status, highlight specific problem areas, focus on local
repair initiatives to include the AFREP processes, and discuss ways to improve the overall repair
cycle process.
   11.34.1. IREP Meeting. The meeting will be held at least quarterly; chaired by the WG/CV
   and attended by the MXG/CC and MSG/CC. Recommended participants include the
   following: LRS, FSC, representatives from maintenance units, O&M resource advisors,
   maintenance analysis, AFREP (if applicable), QA, and others as determined by the MXG/CC
   and MSG/CC. The responsible asset manager should be the focal point to lead the discussion
   of the key data about a specific part.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       207


     11.34.1.1. Subject Matter Review. One of the objectives of the IREP meeting is to
     increase overall base self-sufficiency for repair and reduce the overall cost of operations.
     Topics discussed vary based on local requirements, but should include key elements of
     asset management and costs associated with each of the maintenance stock fund
     divisions. The number of items reviewed in each topic is determined locally. Units
     determine the specific format and visual aids used for presentation of the following
     information:
        11.34.1.1.1. Asset Profile/Top Projected MICAP Situations. An asset profile is an in-
        depth review of an asset identified as critical to mission accomplishment or that
        causes frequent MICAP situations. Data in an asset profile may include number
        authorized and on-hand, number repaired and not repaired, number of MICAPs,
        average repair cycle days, average AWP days, monthly demand, item cost, and
        financial value of assets in the repair cycle. The overall health of the assets should
        include reasons for MICAP situations and solutions to resolve them.
        11.34.1.1.2. Test Station Equipment Profile. Test station in-commission time is
        critical to efficient repair cycle output. TMDE and other shop deficiencies may have a
        negative effect on the base repair cycle process. The wing should focus on actions
        which maximize test station capability.
        11.34.1.1.3. Wing Self-Sufficiency Initiatives. Initiatives include discussion of new
        wing, group and squadron AFREP initiatives and other local self-sufficiency repairs.
        Discussions must include how initiative is crossfed to appropriate depot, Lead
        Command and all other like-MDS bases.
        11.34.1.1.4. High Cost Maintenance. Unit funded TCTOs/modifications, high cost
        work centers, SPRAM back orders, financial value of parts in the repair cycle, etc.
        11.34.1.1.5. Top CANN Items. Items with significant CANN histories. Review
        information which includes the number of times items were CANNed in the last 30
        days, average CANN occurrences over the last 6 months, projected get well date, and
        the time required to CANN the item.
        11.34.1.1.6. Unit Aircraft Engine Status Review. A status review summary should
        include number in work, projected production date, and supply drivers for work
        stoppage.
        11.34.1.1.7. Repair Cycle Bottlenecks. Review any area, which impedes the repair
        cycle process such as frozen supply records, supply, rejects, test station backlogs,
        personnel deficiencies, manpower shortages etc.
        11.34.1.1.8. AWP Summary. Analyze due-outs causes and back order priorities to
        determine if supply action is required to correct any deficiencies/problems.
        11.34.1.1.9. Repair Cycle Throughput. Throughput is the average time it takes to
        move individual items through the repair cycle. Review/compare the 12-month
        average versus the current month repair cycle time (RCT) to determine if progress is
        being made. 2LM reparable items must be processed within one workday/24 hour as
        established in AFI 21-129. Non-2LM repairable items must be processed within 4
        days for serviceable assets and 10 days for unserviceable assets.

           11.34.1.1.10. Part Store Issue Effectiveness. Percentage of aircraft parts issued from
           the flightline part store vs. the main warehouse. Disregard this element when LRS
           does not segregate aircraft components into a separate warehouse.
           11.34.1.1.11. Discuss product improvement initiatives and maintenance related to
           Innovation Development through Employee Awareness (IDEA) submissions, etc..
11.35. Destruction of TOP SECRET Material. Destruction of TOP SECRET material
requires a receipt according to AFI 31-401. Include a copy of the destruction certificate with the
turn-in documentation.
   11.35.1. Provide sensitive instruments interior container protection.
   11.35.2. Ensure a copy of the LRU/SRU historical record accompanies turn-in of all items.
11.36. Certifying Items Associated With Explosives: Ensure items such as Multiple Ejector
Racks (MERS), Triple Ejector Racks (TERS), pylons, launchers, rafts, bomb racks, ejection
seats, fire suppression bottles, AFE and gun systems and components are certified explosive free
prior to turn in to LRS and/or DRMO. Refer to TO 11A-1-60, General Instructions - Inspection
of Reusable Munitions Containers and Scrap Material Generated from Items Exposed to or
Containing XPL, and AFI 21-201 for Material Potentially Presenting and Explosive Hazard
(MPPEH) for specific certification requirements.

        WING WEAPONS MANAGER AND WEAPONS STANDARDIZATION

12.1. Wing Weapons Manager (WWM). The WWM will be a 2W100 CMSgt assigned
directly to the MXG/CC. In units where 2W1 personnel are assigned but no 2W100 authorization
exists, the MXG/CC will appoint the most qualified 2W1 to fulfill WWM responsibilities
outlined in this chapter. (ARC: the Senior Weapons Loading Supervisor serves as the WWM and
does not require assignment to the MXG/CC staff). The WWM is the wing's focal point for all
weapons loading and armament systems related matters. The WWM's primary efforts focus on
compliance, continuity, and standardization. Weapons activities required to support the
generation of peacetime training sorties generally do not reinforce primary combat skills.
Therefore, the WWM plays a key role in ensuring that the unit is able to produce combat loaded
aircraft. The WWM is charged with providing technical and managerial advice to senior leaders
in matters of weapons loading and armament systems. The WWM coordinates with the weapons
sections, armament systems flight, wing weapons and tactics officer, the munitions
squadron/flight, and other unit agencies on weapons related matters. The WWM has the
authority to cross group and squadron functional lines. The WWM (will):
   12.1.1. Is the functional manager for all 2W1X1 personnel. The WWM is the wing POC for
   all 2W1X1 manpower issues within the wing to include coordination on all manning,
   workcenter and organizational changes, AFSC changes, cross/retraining requests and
   waivers. The WWM informs the MAJCOM Armament functional manager of any proposed
   actions that may drive changes in unit manpower requirements (non applicable to ARC).
       12.1.1.1. In Wings where the Armament Systems Flight is organizationally aligned under
       a Munitions Squadron (MUNS), the Armament Systems Flight will organize, operate and
       perform duties and responsibilities per Chapter 5 of this instruction.
   12.1.2. Assign and balance 2W1X1 grades, experience and skill-levels between all 2W1X1
   work centers across the wing. Monitors PRP status of 2W1X1 personnel, if applicable.
   Rotate 2W1XX personnel between wing work centers (armament flight, weapons sections,
   WS, QA, etc.) as required to provide breadth of experience, promotion and job opportunities
   within the unit and 2W1 career field. Recommend all personnel be screened and considered
   for rotation at a maximum of every three years (non applicable to ARC). Ensure only
   individuals with the 2W1 AFSC (or equivalent contractor personnel) are certified/qualified to
   load/unload munitions items on aircraft (except for those qualification tasks specifically
   outlined in this AFI).
   12.1.3. Designate the Loading Standardization Crew (LSC), academic instructor, and lead
   crews. LSC Team Chief will be a 2W171 with a minimum grade of TSgt. Lead Crew Chief
   will be 2W171, with a minimum grade of TSgt if unit manning/personnel experience permits.
   Provide load crew training and certification program guidance and monitor implementation.
   12.1.4. Inform the MXG/CC and affected SQ/CC and/or Operations Officer of any issues or
   problems affecting load crew status, Dual Loading Operations (DLO), projected manning,
   equipment, and other items of concern.
   12.1.5. Review the wing/squadron SORTs report prior to submission to the MAJCOM. Any
   equipment or load crew shortfalls which affect the wings C-rating in SORTS will be included
210                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


  and comments provided. Comments will provide reason, action taken and proposed get well
  dates for all 2W1 issues reported in SORTs. SORTS will be reported IAW AFI 10-201.
      12.1.5.1. In units where the AEF Reporting Tool (ART) is used, the WWM will review
      the ART for correct UTC status reporting.
  12.1.6. Monitor overall load crew status and advise the MXG/CC when the number of fully
  certified load crews falls below the UCML/TTML minimum. If this occurs and cannot be
  corrected within 30 days, the following information is sent by secure message, through the
  MXG/CC, to the appropriate MAJCOM 2W1XX functional manager. NOTE: All 2W1X1s
  working outside their respective workcenter or DAFSC will be qualified/certified if possible
  to fill load crew shortfalls before sending a message to the MAJCOM.
      12.1.6.1. Number of 2W1X1 personnel authorized and assigned by work center, skill
      level (primary AFSC) and grade for the entire wing. Include all work centers to which
      2W1X1 personnel are assigned.

      items for which they are not certified and qualified.
      12.1.6.6. Remarks: List limiting factors, equipment shortages, availability of training
      aircraft, etc.
  12.1.7. Annually review DOC Statements, OPLANs, UCML/TTMLs, unit tasked UTCs (for
  equipment and personnel) and UMD to identify any disconnects or problems. Coordinate
  changes and appendices with the wing weapons and tactics function and the munitions flight.
  Report any findings to MAJCOM.
      12.1.7.1. Quarterly validate and document wing 2W1XX UTC AEF taskings against
      existing/squadron DOCs. Specifically, WWM will ensure no shortfalls exist by aligning
      required skill level, grade, line remarks and CFETP qualifications against tasked UTCs to
      include AEF taskings for all assigned 2W1XX personnel. If a shortfall exists, WWM will
      immediately start an aggressive training program to eliminate shortfalls.
  12.1.8. Resolve scheduling conflicts affecting weapons loading and DLO training programs.
  12.1.9. Provide input during development of local exercises involving weapons
  loading/armament functions, and serve as an advisor/evaluator to the wing exercise
  evaluation team.
  12.1.10. Ensure a recognition program for load crew and armament personnel is established.
  12.1.11. Ensure standardization of load crew CTKs by aircraft MDS to the maximum extent
  possible to provide interoperability of load crews. CTKs should contain all tools to
  accommodate common loading and maintenance functions. Weapons load crew CTK
  contents will be approved by the WWM. In coordination with the weapons section NCOIC
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       211


   and WS superintendent, determine the number of loading tool kits required in bomber units,
   and those that support only test, evaluation or training missions.
   12.1.12. Ensure sufficient quantities of serviceable load crew training munitions are
   available to support both load crew and DLO training programs. Review and validate all
   Munitions Forecasts submitted by WS and the Armament Flight prior to submission to
   MAJCOM.
      12.1.12.1. Training munitions: Authorized quantities of training munitions are posted in
      the “Air Force Standard For Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorizations”
      maintained on the AF Portal, AF/A4LW Knowledge Now CoP. The standards are located
      in the policy folder/AFI 21-201/attachment 1. These numbers reflect the maximum
      munitions required exclusively for weapons load crew certification and recurring training
      (WLT). These munitions are forecasted by and assigned to weapons load training (W1)
      accounts. Sortie generation and aircrew classroom training munitions must be forecasted
      for and maintained on separate supply accounts. Munitions required for DLO training
      must be forecasted on the unit sortie surge account.
      12.1.12.2. Units may request additional quantities of munitions than specified on these
      tables but will not be allocated munitions unless sufficient quantities are available to do
      so. The UCML/ TTML will be the source document for WLT munitions requirements
      and authorizations.
      12.1.12.3. Units with multiple MDS will only be authorized the minimum
      allocation/authorization of WLT munitions to facilitate load training on all MDS.
      EXAMPLE: If a base has both F-15E and F-16 aircraft assigned and both MDS are
      tasked on the UCML/TTML for GBU-12 then only two, not four, GBU-12's will be
      allocated to support both MDS. If a situation exists where the WLT facilities are
      physically separated and the WWM determines it negatively impacts load crew training
      to move munitions from one to the other, then each facility will be authorized the
      minimum number of tasked training munitions.
   12.1.13. Ensure introductory training is provided to newly assigned personnel on aircraft
   familiarization, safe for maintenance, explosive safety, weapons release and gun systems
   maintenance prior to performing duties. Training, certification and qualification required to
   load munitions on aircraft are only provided by Weapons Standardization. All wing 2W1X1
   personnel regardless of duty position will receive initial and recurring weapons academics.
   12.1.14. Based on unit taskings, designate the number of load crews, other than the LSC and
   lead crews, to be certified on support or limited use munitions. In nuclear tasked units the
   WWM determines the number of load crews required to be certified on applicable nuclear
   weapons in support of Oplans, when the Oplans DOC does not dictate load crew
   requirements.
NOTE: (ARC) The WWM Coordinates with the MXG/CC in determining the number of load
crews to be certified on support or limited use munitions.
   12.1.15. Develop, in coordination with the explosive safety officer, airfield management,
   and Quality Assurance, an Installation Publication or supplement to this AFI for parking,
   launch and recovery of explosives-loaded aircraft, end of runway procedures, and to outline
212                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


  situations warranting impoundment of aircraft with hung ordnance, delayed release or
  jammed gun systems. The publication or supplement must include requirements to:
      12.1.15.1. Arm and de-arm munitions-loaded aircraft in approved areas. Immediately-
      prior-to-launch and "safing" procedures may be performed in the aircraft parking area for
      contingencies, unit exercises, and daily training missions as quantity distance clearance
      allows with the approval of wing safety, airfield management and the MXG/CC.
      12.1.15.2. Establish procedures for inspecting and "safing" hung munitions or external
      stores before aircraft return to parking areas. Control access to aircraft until munitions are
      made safe and cause of hung stores is identified. As a rule, ensure aircraft guns and
      rockets are "safed" in the de-arm area before aircraft return to open ramp parking areas.
  12.1.16. Monitor weapons release/gun fire-out rates, malfunctions and corrective actions to
  assess weapons and armament systems reliability. Take appropriate action to resolve any
  problems and contact MAJCOM for assistance if required.
      12.1.16.1. Weapons release reliability rates are calculated by dividing the number of
      successful releases by the number of attempts (Goal: 99%).
      12.1.16.2. The gun fire-out rate is calculated by dividing the number of successful bursts
      by the number attempted (Goal: 98%). Once a malfunction occurs, any further attempts
      for the purpose of clearing the malfunction should not be counted as attempts.
  12.1.17. Ensure compliance with local accountability procedures for AFI 36-2217 and AFI
  21-201. In conjunction with the weapons sections and munitions flight, develop a standard
  local format for the AF IMT 2434. A computer generated product may be used if it contains
  all required information.
  12.1.18. Coordinate with the MOO, munitions flight, weapons safety and operations plans in
  developing nuclear weapons operations procedures (e.g., convoy, custody transfer, no-lone-
  zone) if applicable.
  12.1.19. Ensure LME and MMHE meet the requirements outlined in Chapter 10 of this
  instruction.
  12.1.20. Conduct a wing weapons meeting monthly (quarterly for ARC) with representatives
  from WS, wing safety, quality assurance, munitions flight, armament flight, and the weapons
  sections to discuss and resolve any wing weapons issues, concerns or problems. Weapons
  AFETS are encouraged to attend.
  12.1.21. Short tour locations will ensure en route training requirements for inbound 2W1X1
  personnel are identified and requested through the MAJCOM.
  12.1.22. Monitor WRM Rack, Adapter, Pylons (RAP) and guns/components status to ensure
  required assets are available to support OPLAN tasking.
  12.1.23. Provide monthly (quarterly for ANG) manning, weapons release and gun reliability
  rates, equipment, and tester status (9405 report) to Lead MAJCOM NLT the 5th of each
  month. Monitor the status of critical armament and weapons systems support equipment and
  testers for serviceability, accountability and status of TCTO modifications.

      12.1.23.1. Provide a valid document number and off-base requisition number for all
      items listed in AWP status in the remarks column of the report if the item is procured
      through USAF supply channels. If parts are obtained from commercial sources, and
      purchased using IMPAC card, provide source, date ordered, and status in the remarks
      column.
   12.1.24. Utilize and involve assigned Weapons AFETS in wing aircraft weapons and
   armament related issues and meetings IAW AFI 21-110.
   12.1.25. Inform the MAJCOM, within 24 hours, of any significant weapons or armament
   related issues such as dropped/hung munitions, equipment and aircraft release reliability or
   deficiency problems, and weapons safety or mishap issues.
      12.1.25.1. If a unit has an incident, it is important to preserve the evidence to the
      maximum extent allowable by operational requirements and safety. An example would be
      segregating an aircraft gun versus destroying it if it poses no immediate danger. This
      allows for evaluation of all the evidence and the ability to recreate the mishap conditions.
      12.1.25.2. If a malfunctioning munitions item (live or inert) causes a mishap refer to
      para 9.7.4.
   12.1.26. See Chapter 7 of this instruction for information on Aircraft Generation Planning.
   12.1.27. Ensure at least two certified WS personnel are included on TDYs where live
   munitions will be expended and on deployments exceeding 30 days to provide MPRL and
   recertification capability. Exceptions must be approved by the WWM
   12.1.28. Perform annual assessment on WS, weapons sections, armament flights, and 2W1
   personnel assigned to QA. Document findings and track corrective actions. Maintain copies
   of last two assessment results.
   12.1.29. WWM, with concurrence of MXG/CC, determines when armament flight personnel
   are required to perform load crew duties or related certifiable tasks.
   12.1.30. Determine need for a formal supervisory postload program (local option). If
   negative performance metrics, special missions, etc., warrant a supervisory postload
   program, WWM will establish procedures and a training program to ensure standardization
   between units. Supervisors (7-skill level minimum, expediters, shift supervisors, section
   NCOICs, etc.) performing such inspections require initial and recurring (not exceeding 15
 214                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   months interval) qualification training by WS. Training will be documented in either the
   WLCMT (or equivalent) or MIS, not on SCR. Document supervisory postload on AF IMT
   2430 (or equivalent).
   12.1.31. Ensure requirements for submitting AFTO IMT 375 on all weapons support
   equipment identified in TO 35-1-24 are accomplished. This process provides vital
   information and source documentation for ALCs to adequately reflect equipment sustainment
   costs, attrition rates, and to enable timely forecasting for replacement funding.
12.2. Weapons Standardization. The Weapons Standardization Section plans and conducts
both conventional and nuclear weapons load training to accomplish operational plans and
objectives. Initial and recurring load training, is crucial in maintaining a competent and
proficient certified nuclear and conventional force to meet both peacetime and wartime tasking.
WS is organized under the WWM and is comprised of the superintendent, the LSC, and lead
crews. An LSC may be formed for each MDS in multiple MDS units. One lead crew is normally
formed for each AMU, but additional crews can be formed as needed. Lead crews return to an
AMU for contingencies, deployments, generations and exercises. WS does not need to be formed
in organizations that do not load munitions requiring certification providing the requirements of
the weapons task qualification program are met, to include academic, practical, and recurring
training. In organizations such as this, the weapons function will be responsible for applicable
weapons manager responsibilities and the weapons task qualification program. In a wing, WS is
administratively assigned to the MOS but works directly for the WWM (NA for ARC).
   12.2.1. The key to successful combat/test/training operations is trained load crews proficient
   at generating aircraft configured to support combat and contingency plans. Units will
   maintain at least the minimum number of required certified load crews (as specified on the
   UCML/TTML). Achieving this standard may require units to certify/qualify weapons
   personnel who may be assigned duties outside the weapons sections. Although assigned to
   support sections, resource advisor duties, etc., 2W1X1 personnel remain accountable for their
   primary load crew duties, will be managed accordingly, and are counted in wing 2W1X1
   manpower totals.
   12.2.2. WS Superintendent Responsibilities. The superintendent is responsible to the WWM,
   and performs section NCOIC duties outlined in Chapter 3 of this instruction. The
   superintendent develops and oversees the weapons standardization program, sets standards,
   develops local policies and procedures, and interprets all technical data and directives
   governing the weapons standardization program. The WS superintendent will: NOTE: (ARC
   & AFSOC) WS superintendent responsibilities may be performed by the LSC crew chief.
       12.2.2.1. Coordinate with the weapons section NCOICs to schedule crews for initial
       training, certification, minimum proficiency requirement loading (MPRL), and semi-
       annual evaluations (SAE) training. The WS superintendent will document monthly
       scheduling effectiveness (quarterly for ARC) and submit a summary letter for inclusion
       in the MSEP, including as a minimum:
           12.2.2.1.1. Load Crew Scheduling and Training Effectiveness (MPRL/SAE) (non
           applicable to ARC):
              12.2.2.1.1.1. Crews scheduled versus completed training events (non applicable
              to ARC).
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     215


            12.2.2.1.1.2. Passed versus failed evaluations.
            12.2.2.1.1.3. Problems/trends which detracted from scheduling and training.
     12.2.2.2. Coordinate with the PS&D to ensure availability of training aircraft.
     12.2.2.3. Manage WLT training munitions, components, and accessories by establishing
     a supply point with munitions (Munitions Operations) for conventional training
     munitions. WS will establish an equipment account for nuclear training weapons and
     accessories, if required. Document and schedule discrepancies requiring repair on
     training munitions through munitions control.
     12.2.2.4. Ensure load crew training munitions are maintained to the same standard as the
     parent munitions to the maximum extent possible. Training munitions must represent the
     parent munitions item in configuration, body color and mechanical function. Those
     having discrepancies, which affect safety, reliability, or detract from load crew training
     are not used.
        12.2.2.4.1. Load crew training munitions and components are inspected on a 180-day
        interval by the WS or more frequently if mandated by commodity TOs. Develop a
        formal agreement with the munitions flight concerning periodic inspection,
        maintenance, and refurbishment and forms documentation. An AFTO IMT
        244/Missile marriage record (or automated form) is maintained for each AUR
        training munition.
        12.2.2.4.2. AFTO IMT 244/Missile marriage record (and/or automated forms for
        training munitions only) are maintained by the WS and accompany the munition item
        when turned in for repair or scheduled inspection.
        12.2.2.4.3. An AFTO Form 350 accompanies munitions and munitions components
        when they are turned in to the munitions flight for repair.
     12.2.2.5. Use the guidelines established in AFI 21-201 when submitting the annual
     forecast to the MAJCOM.
     12.2.2.6. Order training munitions and munitions items to meet unit needs.
     12.2.2.7. If sufficient training munitions are not available to support DLO training,
     coordinate use of assigned items from WS supply point for management flexibility.
     12.2.2.8. Use the WLCMT, or equivalent program, to track load crew certification and
     qualification status. Unless computer systems are networked or modem-interfaced,
     printed products are produced and distributed at least twice each month to the weapons
     section NCOICs. Printed products are formatted so that manual updates can be made
     between issues. Monthly, generate a printed product, or electronic back-up copy, for WS
     records.
     12.2.2.9. Upon notification of a deployment or an increased state of alert, takes
     appropriate action to certify load crews on support munitions if required.
     12.2.2.10. Maintain a copy of all applicable AF loading TOs for assigned MDS aircraft.
     Training and test units need only maintain checklists for munitions to support weapons
     load crew training required to sustain daily flying operations and for munitions
     undergoing test and evaluation.
216                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      12.2.2.11. Coordinate with the AMU Production Super to ensure WLT aircraft are
      properly configured and safe for use.
      12.2.2.12. Develop time standards for integrated loads.
      12.2.2.13. Ensure all load crews are qualified to load and unload internal gun system
      ammunition (including partial loads, at WWM’s discretion), and preloaded chaff/flare
      modules on assigned aircraft.
      12.2.2.14. Ensure load crews demonstrate proficiency on all capable aircraft racks and
      stations prior to certification on that munition. For conventional munitions capable of
      multiple carriage, both aircraft parent station and multiple carriage loading are required.
      For nuclear weapons, only the aircraft stations that are maintained in nuclear certified
      status are loaded.
      12.2.2.15. Inspect 25 percent of WS CTKs, armament test and support equipment for
      serviceability, at least quarterly, and initiates corrective action as required. Schedule and
      track inspections to ensure 100 percent of CTKs, test, and support equipment will be
      checked over a one-year time-frame. Document inspection results and use for follow-up
      action and reference as necessary.
      12.2.2.16. See Chapter 14 of this instruction regarding the SCR, End of Runway, self
      inspection program and Sortie Generation Operations guidance.
      12.2.2.17. See Chapter 10 of this instruction regarding lost tools.
      12.2.2.18. Ensure MAJCOM Mandatory Course List (MMCL) requirements are met.
      12.2.2.19. Ensure individual tool kits are set up for each lead crew assigned. These CTKs
      may be stored in WS or the respective squadron, but are required to be maintained by the
      Lead Crews. In coordination with the WWM and weapons section NCOICs, determine
      the number of loading tool kits required in bomber units, and those that support only test,
      evaluation or training missions.
      12.2.2.20. Assist the WWM in managing load crew incentive program to recognize
      deserving load crews.
      12.2.2.21. See Chapter 1 of this instruction for duty shift, UCML, and command missile
      policy guidance.
      12.2.2.22. See Chapter 7 of this instruction for documenting maintenance.
      12.2.2.23. See Chapter 2 of this instruction for Safety.
      12.2.2.24. See Chapter 9 of this instruction for impound procedures.
      12.2.2.25. Ensure load crews are familiar with fuze inspection, installation and wiring
      IAW MDS-33 series TO procedures or TO 11A-1-63 (bombers). Conduct this training
      during initial certification.
      12.2.2.26. Ensure Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE) are performed on each
      LSC/Lead Crew member at least semi-annually to validate standardization of the
      weapons load training program. Document results on the AF Form 2419 and maintain
      within the WLCMT.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      217


           12.2.2.26.1. WWM and/or Weapons Standardization Superintendent perform EPEs
           on Loading Standardization Crew (LSC) members during load crew Semi-Annual
           Evaluations. (EXCEPTION: 354 FW, EPEs will be accomplished during Weapons
           Task Qualification training.)
           12.2.2.26.2. LSC members perform EPEs on Lead Crew members during load crew
           Minimum Proficiency Requirement Loading evaluations.
12.3. Loading Standardization Crew (LSC). The LSC works for the WS Superintendent and
conducts the weapons standardization and evaluation program. The WWM and/or WS
Superintendent evaluate and certify the LSC according to criteria in this section. The LSC team
chief must be at least a TSgt 2W171. The LSC trains, evaluates, and certifies the lead crews and
load crews in safe and reliable munitions loading procedures. NOTE: (ARC) If the LSC crew
chief is performing WS superintendent duties then the WWM will evaluate and certify the LSC.
The LSC will:
   12.3.1. Conduct and monitor training to ensure personnel maintain a high degree of
   proficiency in loading unit-committed munitions.
   12.3.2. Monitor certification and recurring training documents for accuracy and to ensure all
   load crew members complete required proficiency and academic training. The LSC takes
   decertification action if recurring requirements are not met.
   12.3.3. Ensure all load crew training is documented.
   12.3.4. Review and coordinate on all loading related AFTO IMT 22's and TODCR (F-22A)
   IAW TO 00-5-1.
   12.3.5. Develop and coordinate weekly and monthly load training aircraft requirements with
   the PS&D. This paragraph does not apply when the unit is using a permanently assigned load
   crew trainer.
   12.3.6. Monitor and evaluate lead crews in the performance of their duties.
   12.3.7. Provide non-load crew personnel initial and recurring weapons task qualification
   training, including practical training on:
       12.3.7.1. Weapons system safety devices to include proper use, identification,
       installation and removal.
       12.3.7.2. Munitions item safety requirements.
       12.3.7.3. Location of weapons system explosive items used to jettison and release
       external stores.
       12.3.7.4. Stray voltage checks, as required.
       12.3.7.5. Location and position of cockpit armament system switches.
   12.3.8. Perform spot inspections and evaluate flightline munitions/explosive handling,
   loading and postloading operations, and provide MPRL/qualification credit to the maximum
   extent. Augment wing inspection/evaluation teams during local exercises to assess munitions
   loading capabilities and activities.
 218                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   12.3.9. Perform semi-annual evaluations on all certified load crews. Lead crew members
   may assist; however, at least one member of the LSC must be present during all semi-annual
   evaluations.
12.4. Academic Instructor. An LSC member is designated to manage the weapons academic
training program. Designated WS members (7-skill level), one primary and no more than two
alternates, will conduct initial and recurring weapons academic training for all wing 2W1X1s (or
equivalent contractor personnel). The instructors will be familiar with the assigned MDS
weapons system and all UCML items. The weapons academics instructor is not considered a
maintenance instructor.
12.5. Lead Crews. The lead crews are assigned to the WS and assist the LSC in training,
evaluating and certifying unit load crews in safe and reliable munitions loading procedures. They
document, initiate and maintain the database to reflect qualification, certification status and
history of assigned load crew members. Ensure all load crew members complete required
proficiency/academic training and take decertification action when recurring requirements are
not met. Perform spot inspections and evaluations of flightline munitions/explosive handling and
loading operations when not directly involved in WS training functions, and provide
MPRL/qualification credit to the maximum extent. Perform flightline loading evaluations when
deployed, as required, in addition to their normal load crew duties. These evaluations may be
used to satisfy load crew MPRL requirements IAW this chapter.
   12.5.1. Initiate and maintain AF IMT 2435, Load Training and Certification Document, or
   locally devised form that covers everything on the AF IMT 2435, for certified crew
   members.
12.6. Training Facilities/Aircraft.
   12.6.1. Practical training is conducted in a facility dedicated to load crew training. The
   facility is of sufficient size to accommodate required aircraft, training munitions and
   associated support equipment. It is recommended that bomber aircraft have dedicated load-
   training facilities, however, where not practical, inside facilities should be provided to the
   maximum extent possible during periods of extreme inclement weather. Adequate office
   space and classroom with appropriate heating and cooling are required in the academic and
   practical training area.
   12.6.2. Aircraft will have a fully configured and operational (electrical and mechanical)
   weapons system for load training purposes. If a permanent load trainer (Armament Systems
   Trainer, Ground Instructional Training Aircraft) is assigned, it also will have a fully
   configured and operational weapons system. In addition, the WS will develop a schedule for
   periodic maintenance to weapons system components.
12.7. Academic Training. All 2W1X1s (and civilian equivalents performing in 2W1 capacity)
assigned to a wing regardless of duty position, and non-2W1X1 personnel who maintain specific
weapons task qualification, are required to complete initial and recurring (not exceeding a 15-
month interval) academic training. 2W1X1 and non-2W1X1 QAEs assigned contract
surveillance oversight duties of civilian contractors that perform MQ-1/MQ-9 munitions
loading/unloading operations will complete MQ-1/MQ-9 specific weapons academic training.
Complete initial academic training before the start of any practical training. Recurring academic
training may also be part of training and recertification for failed loads. Initial and recurring
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        219


course outlines may be combined. A minimum score of 80 percent is required to receive credit
for academic testing. Coordinate training requirements and course control documents annually
through the wing weapons safety office or the safety officer and the MTF. The weapons safety
office approves all nuclear surety training lesson plans. The WWM is the final approval authority
for course documents.
   12.7.1. Course control documents are tailored to unit and contingency needs and, as a
   minimum, cover the following items:
       12.7.1.1. Publications, applicable weapons related local operating procedures or
       directives.
       12.7.1.2. Safety (ground and explosive) and security.
       12.7.1.3. Aircraft, munitions, AGE, SE, TMDE, and munitions trailer familiarization.
       12.7.1.4. Testers, handling equipment and special tools.
       12.7.1.5. Operations in revetments/protective aircraft shelters.
       12.7.1.6. Weapons storage and security system vaults (tasked units).
       12.7.1.7. Applicable command unique training requirements in 36-22XX supplements.
       12.7.1.8. Hazards inherent during CSO.
       12.7.1.9. Task Assignment List (TAL) and applicable –16/-33 TOs (initial academics /
       load crew personnel only).
       12.7.1.10. Explain Master Nuclear Certification List, Dull Sword definition and
       reporting procedures IAW AFMAN 91-221 and other related directives. (Applies to all
       units with nuclear certified equipment regardless of mission)
       12.7.1.11. Nuclear weapons systems fault isolation and troubleshooting procedures (if
       applicable)
       12.7.1.12. Explain procedures for operations involving nuclear weapons, to include
       safety wiring and sealing, use of Tamper Detection Indicators (TDI), two-person concept,
       no-lone zone, personnel reliability program (PRP), and AF IMT 504 custody transfer
       procedures (if applicable).
       12.7.1.13. Discuss accident, incident and deficiency reporting. Include in this training:
       DULL SWORD, AVOID AMBER, AVOID RED, BENT SPEAR, BROKEN ARROW,
       NUCFLASH, EMPTY QUIVER, Weapons Custody and Control Procedures and
       Command Disablement Systems (if applicable).
   12.7.2. Load crew academic training may fulfill the requirements for explosive safety and
   nuclear surety training if requirements of AFI 91-101 and AFMAN 91-201 are met.
   12.7.3. Weapons Expediter training - Weapons expediter training will be instructed by the
   Weapons Academic instructor. Initial training is required prior to assuming duties as a
   weapons expediter and refresher training is every 15 months. The following subjects will be
   addressed minimal per course: See Figure 12.1.
12.8. Practical Training. Practical training starts when academic training is complete. The
LSC or lead crews administer practical training to each load crew member on required munitions
 220                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


and aircraft. They ensure practical training duplicates operational conditions to the maximum
extent possible and stress requirements such as DLOs, two-person concept, safety wiring and
sealing/roto sealing, controlled access and weapon custody receipt and transfer procedures, as
required. Load crew members are trained on loading and unloading procedures prior to
qualification or certification on munitions.
   12.8.1. If a specific type or model of munition has been requisitioned but not received or not
   available, any type or model of the basic item may be used for load crew training until receipt
   of the munition. LSC/lead crew personnel will teach the major differences between training
   and WRM munitions.
   12.8.2. Load crews must be familiar with munitions serviceability criteria and munitions tie-
   down procedures in TO 11-1-38, Non-nuclear Munitions, Positioning and Tie-Down
   Procedures and, as applicable, TO 11N-B1004-1, Nuclear Weapons Tie-Down Procedures.
   Blanket rejection of training munitions during load training is not authorized, and munitions
   may not be rejected solely because they are inert.
   12.8.3. Initial support munitions (SM) / limited use munitions (LM) training may be
   accomplished concurrently with initial primary munitions (PM) training and certification, but
   will be accomplished within 30 days (90 days for ARC) of completion of initial
   training/certification. When a new PM, SM or LM is designated on the UCML/TTML, LSC
   and lead crews require certification within 30 days (90 days for ARC) after receipt of training
   items.
   12.8.4. Load crew members will be familiar with the operation of AGE and SE which may
   be used during loading operations, even if the items are not used on a routine basis. Training
   on this type of equipment should be conducted by the base AGE Flight prior to initial
   training whenever possible; however, training may be provided by WS trainers if necessary
   to facilitate weapons load training.
   12.8.5. Units with a nuclear tasking that operate from, or deploy to, locations equipped with
   weapons storage and security system (WS3) vaults in protective aircraft shelters, will train
   load crews to unload and load weapons from and into the vault. An approved locally
   manufactured stand may be used to simulate the storage vaults for load and unload training
   (drawings are available through the MMHE Focal Point).
   12.8.6. All nuclear certified load crews at units with or without WS3 will be trained on
   trailer handling/tie-down procedures quarterly.
12.9. Load Crew Composition. Load crews consist of two, three or four persons within the
2W1 AFSC as follows (except for those qualification tasks specifically outlined in this AFI):
   12.9.1. Two-member crews: CV-22, AC-130H, MC-130E/H/P, HH-60 and MQ-1.
   12.9.2. Three-member crews: AC-130U, A/OA–10, F–15, F–16, F-22A and MQ-9.
   12.9.3. Four member crews: B–1, B–2, and B–52.
12.10. Task Assignment List (TAL). A TAL is a functional grouping of procedural steps from
applicable -16/-33 series TOs, by crew position, to be accomplished in sequence by each crew
member during a loading operation. TALs are used during training for all loading operations
except those for which job oriented procedures have been published (B-2 rotary launcher
conventional munitions, and B-52H CALCM pylon and CSRL loading/unloading is
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         221


accomplished procedurally parallel to the -16 procedures). TALs will include single, DLO and
integrated munitions loading procedures (including gun and chaff/flare loading). Units may
develop TALs for aircraft armament electrical functional checks (at unit’s discretion). Their
purpose is to standardize procedures and facilitate the training of unit load crews. TALs are not a
replacement for TO procedures. Separate TALs will be developed for weapons qualification
tasks performed by non-2W1X1 personnel. MPRLs and semi-annual evaluations are not
considered training operations. The following guidelines establish minimum responsibilities of
individual crew members:
   12.10.1. Two member load crews:
       12.10.1.1. Crew member number one is the load crew chief and is in charge of the
       loading operation, performs functional checks and attaches stores to the pylon/rack.
       12.10.1.2. Crew member number two assists the number one person in performing the
       pylon/rack preparation and installation of stores to vehicle.
   12.10.2. Three member load crews (slight variations (i.e.; power application, ops checks
   performance, etc.,) exist with newer MDS (F-22, UAS) and will be outlined in TALS;
   however, key duties of individual members remain the same):
       12.10.2.1. Crew member number one is the load crew chief and is in charge of the
       loading operation, positions cockpit switches during functional checks and attaches stores
       to the pylon/rack.
       12.10.2.2. Crew member number two performs the pylon/rack preparation and operates
       test equipment during functional checks.
       12.10.2.3. Crew member number three performs munitions preparation and operates the
       bomblift truck during loading operations.
   12.10.3. Four member load crews:
       12.10.3.1. Crew member number one is the load crew chief and is in charge of the
       loading operation, positions the cockpit switches and attaches stores to the pylon/rack.
       12.10.3.2. Crew member number two performs the pylon/rack preparation, operates test
       equipment during functional checks and assists in loading of stores.
       12.10.3.3. Crew member number three performs munitions preparation.
       12.10.3.4. Crew member number four performs rack/pylon preparation, operates test
       equipment during functional checks, and operates the bomb lift truck.
12.11. Weapons Load Training Basic Terms.
   12.11.1. All-Up-Round (AUR). A munitions item which is shipped and stored in a complete,
   ready to use configuration. An AUR munition requires no pre-assembly.
   12.11.2. All-Up-Round Container (AURC). A container used to ship, store, and handle AUR
   munitions. Some AURCs are designed to load munitions directly from them onto an aircraft.
   12.11.3. Dual loading operations (DLO). A conventional munitions loading operation on
   bomber aircraft accomplished simultaneously by two load crews. (MAJCOM approval
   required for fighter aircraft).
 222                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   12.11.4. Integrated Load. The loading of two or more different types of munitions in an
   authorized configuration during a single operation.
   12.11.5. Limited Use Munition (LM). May include, but is not limited to, munitions used by a
   unit for firepower demonstrations, test, aircrew training or like operations. LMs may include
   munitions which may be used in a war or a contingency. LMs are designated on the
   UCML/TTML. WWM determines the number of crews to be certified.
   12.11.6. Munitions Family Group (MFG). A designated grouping of munitions based on
   similarity of either physical characteristics or procedural commonality. Certification on a
   MFG is accomplished during initial training on each tasked munition within the MFG
   (subject to availability of training munitions) then maintained through the MPRL process.
   12.11.7. Postload Checks. Power-on checks and/or tasks required by technical data prior to
   declaring munitions-loaded on aircraft mission ready.
   12.11.8. Primary Munition (PM). Munitions which will be the primary weapons used by the
   unit to execute test/training or their DOC war plan and are designated on the UCML/TTML.
   12.11.9. Standard Conventional Load (SCL). The designation, which includes the number,
   type and configuration of authorized munitions, required for a specific mission and aircraft
   load.
   12.11.10. Support Munition (SM). A munition which may be used in support of contingency
   plans or directives and is designated on the UCML/TTML. WWM determines the number of
   crews (other than LSC/Lead Crew) to be certified.
   12.11.11. Monthly, Bi-Monthly, Semiannual, or Annual Intervals. Requirements will be
   accomplished by the last day of the scheduled month.
12.12. Load Crew Certification/Decertification
   12.12.1. Certification. These guidelines are used to establish the loading standardization and
   evaluation program. The LSC will establish and manage a program to train, certify and
   maintain proficiency for each crew on the munitions designated by the UCML/TTML or
   WWM for SMs/LMs. Certification and training requirements for load crews are based on the
   following:
       12.12.1.1. Except the LSC and lead crews, load crew members are not certified on more
       than 10 MFGs. Dual position (LSC and Lead Crew) or dual MDS (LSC only)
       certification is authorized; however, personnel may not be certified on more than 10
       MFGs (Exceptions; dual MDS certification is authorized for F-15 C/D/E Lead Crews.
       Certified LSCs and SLCs on F-15C/D/E may be certified on up to 12 MFGs based upon
       operational requirements). Proficiency requirements are accomplished on both aircraft
       IAW this chapter. Personnel who are dual position certified will ensure they comply with
       MPRL and SAE requirements in both positions for which they are certified; they will not
       alternate between the two. Test wing personnel may be certified on more than 10 MFGs
       and multiple MDS provided all other requirements for load certification, qualification and
       evaluations are complied with and authorized by the WWM. UAS (MQ-1/MQ-9)
       personnel are exempt from the dual MDS/position restrictions imposed by this paragraph;
       crews may be certified on both MDS’, and #2 and #3 members may be certified in both
       positions, provided they fulfill all certification requirements directed in this instruction.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       223


     NOTE: AFRC Dual position certification of full time (ARTs) or dual MDS (LSC only)
     certification of load crew members is authorized; however, they may not be certified on
     more than 10 MFGs. In the dual or secondary position, personnel will only load
     munitions for which they are certified, and will comply with requirements stated above.
     Dual certify only in the MFGs required to meet mission requirements.
     12.12.1.2. LSC, lead crews, and load crews are certified on all PMs. The LSC and lead
     crews are certified on all SMs to provide the cadre for future certification of unit load
     crews. The LSC is certified (or qualified for items so identified by unit tasking) on unit
     LMs. The WWM determines the number of additional load crews trained and certified on
     support and limited use munitions.
     12.12.1.3. A minimum of two certifying officials are required to evaluate three and four-
     member load crews. A minimum of one certifying official is required for two-person load
     crews.
     12.12.1.4. Load crew member certification is valid worldwide with gaining WWMs
     concurrence. Reassignment does not necessarily require recertification by the gaining
     unit if the individual is certified on the same munitions, aircraft, and load crew position;
     and if MPRL or SAE requirements are current. Units develop procedures to ensure that
     WLCMT or equivalent data is provided to the individual prior to permanent change of
     station (PCS) departure. Losing units, therefore, provide gaining units with the AF IMT
     2435 or equivalent.
     12.12.1.5. Personnel must be certified before loading war reserve nuclear weapons.
     Certified load crews may be evaluated by using war reserve weapons if the weapons are
     scheduled for loading or movement.
     12.12.1.6. Personnel must be certified before loading conventional munitions, unless
     loading under the direct supervision of a minimum of two certifying officials.
  12.12.2. Document decertification and/or disqualification actions in the WLCMT (or
  equivalent). Decertify and disqualify individual load crew members if they:
     12.12.2.1. Fail to complete a required evaluation (SAE, MPRL, Qualification). If a load
     crew member is on TDY, emergency leave, incapacitated, or involved in an unannounced
     local or higher headquarters exercise/contingency operation, do not decertify or
     disqualify the member providing the current SAE/MPRL/Qualification requirements
     (plus all past-due evaluations) are completed within 30 days of returning to duty (60 days
     for ARC). (EXCEPTION: Member’s who fail to complete a required evaluation on a
     certification item within a 180-day period due to medical reasons will be decertified on
     the particular item(s) and must reaccomplish practical training for recertification).
     NOTE: (ARC only) Provisions in this paragraph also apply when individuals are
     excused/rescheduled from a Unit Training Assembly (UTA) and when loading operations
     are cancelled due to inclement weather.
     12.12.2.2. Fail to accomplish recurring academic training. Individuals are
     administratively decertified and disqualified on all UCML/TTML and qualification items
     until academic training is completed. Once accomplished, individuals may be
     administratively recertified and/or re-qualified. NOTE: Do not decertify/disqualify
     member's whose absence is due to leave or TDY. Member must receive academic
224                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      training within 30 days (60 days for ARC) of returning to duty or the member will be
      decertified on all UCML/TTML and qualification items.
      12.12.2.3. 2W1X1 and non-2W1X1 personnel performing as QAE Inspectors providing
      oversight of civilian contractor MQ-1/MQ-9 munitions loading/unloading operations are
      authorized to decertify contract munitions loading personnel if safety, reliability or lack
      of technical proficiency is demonstrated. The Lead Contractor Maintenance authority
      may also recommend decertification of MQ-1/MQ-9 munitions loading/unloading
      contract personnel to the on-sight QAE authority.
      12.12.2.4. Fail an evaluation due to the following criteria (applies to initial certification,
      MPRLs and SAEs):
         12.12.2.4.1. Exceeded time standard results in a failed rating for the load crew chief.
         12.12.2.4.2. A safety or reliability error results in a failed rating for the individual. A
         failure in this category due to a single sub-task error need not result in complete
         retraining/recertification for the loading task. At the discretion of the evaluator, sub-
         task retraining or thorough critique may be used to satisfy retraining/recertification
         requirements.
             12.12.2.4.2.1. Safety Error: A violation of safety publications, TO warnings, etc.,
             or an unsafe act that could reasonably lead to personal injury or death.
             12.12.2.4.2.2. Reliability Error: A violation of TO requirements that could
             reasonably lead to damage/premature failure of equipment or prevent safe reliable
             operation of a weapons system or release of a weapon.
         12.12.2.4.3. A demonstrated lack of technical proficiency by an individual load crew
         member can result in a failed rating. If the time standard is exceeded for this reason,
         the load crew chief does not need to be decertified.
         12.12.2.4.4. For integrated loads, the evaluator may elect decertification on any one
         or all munitions loaded. When the same rating is not applied to all munitions loaded
         during an integrated load, the load crew records will be annotated accordingly.
         12.12.2.4.5. Intervention by an evaluator during loading to prevent injury to
         personnel or damage to equipment may result in a failed rating.
         12.12.2.4.6. More than three errors per crew member results in a failed rating for the
         individual.
  12.12.3. AGM-65 tasked units shall load train using both the LAU-88 (if applicable) and
  LAU-117 launchers. Alternate launcher use each time the weapon is loaded in proficiency
  training (i.e., for crews on 30-day MPRL schedule load the LAU-117 one quarter and the
  LAU-88 the next quarter). LAU-117 loading need only be accomplished using the pre-load
  method. LAU-88 loading is accomplished by the single load and pre-load methods during the
  same training period. Single AGM-65 loading on LAU-88 launchers is accomplished using
  both MJ-1 and MHU-83 bomb lift trucks on an alternating basis and consists of a minimum
  of two missiles (one shoulder and one bottom station). Preloaded LAU-88 launchers are in an
  unbalanced configuration (one loaded and one empty shoulder station).
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                           225


       12.12.3.1. In test wings, the WWM will determine in writing the necessity to alternate
       loading the AGM-65 between the LAU-117 and LAU-88 based on Test Directives and
       unit planning documents.
   12.12.4. Units which have the AGM-88 as a PM/SM will demonstrate the ability to load the
   LAU-118 using both the single store and preload methods.
   12.12.5. F-15 AIM-120 loading will be alternated between the LAU-128 and LAU-106
   launcher.
   12.12.6. Personnel certified to load nuclear weapons on aircraft, may perform weapons
   transfer and tie-down procedures to and from trailers, WS3 vaults, and support stands for
   which load standardization training has been established and conducted IAW this instruction.
   They will not require these actions as separate certification items.
   12.12.7. Annually perform a SCL while wearing the ground crew chemical-defense
   ensemble using 33-1-2/33-2-1 procedures (if applicable). Credit may be given during
   exercises provided a full SCL is completely evaluated.
   12.12.8. Internal and external conventional munitions loads on B-52 aircraft will be
   documented separately. For munitions loading on B-1 aircraft, loading the 28 carriage
   conventional bomb module (CBM) does not satisfy requirements for 10 carriage CBMs.
   12.12.9. For contingency operations or deployed locations an Lead Crew should be, and is
   normally, deployed to perform WS functions. If a Lead Crew is not deployed, the senior
   2W1X1 weapons loading person (with WWM coordination) on location will have WS
   authority. EXAMPLE: A new munition or load configuration is required to support
   operations and crews need to be trained on location (provided Seek Eagle approval has been
   granted and verified technical data/procedures are available).
12.13. Load Configurations. All munitions loads will be authorized load configurations IAW
the applicable MDS flight manual or valid SEEK EAGLE flight clearance.
   12.13.1. For initial training a full complement of munitions (if available) will be loaded a
   minimum of once on a rotary launcher, TER, BRA, CBM, etc. to provide the crew
   experience loading a full load.
   12.13.2. Sufficient weapons will be loaded during each evaluation to ensure the load crew
   demonstrates proficiency on loading/unloading each tasked configuration (adjacent stations,
   upper/lower stations, shoulder/centerline stations, etc.).
12.14. Minimum Proficiency Requirement Loading. All certified load crews perform
proficiency loads monitored by a lead crew or the LSC. The LSC monitors lead crew proficiency
loads. The WWM or WS superintendent will monitor LSC proficiency loads. Post-load
inspections do not meet these proficiency requirements. Each munition an individual is certified
to load, regardless if it is a primary, support or limited use munition, will be loaded at least once
within a 180 day period (90 day period for short tour locations). One third of the required
munitions will be loaded bi-monthly (monthly for short tour locations) to demonstrate crew
proficiency. For those munitions where no training assets exist (CBU-97, CBU-105, M129, etc.)
difference training will be provided prior to initial certification and during recurring academics
training. Load crews in air defense/air superiority units perform proficiency loads bi-monthly
using all committed primary munitions. For B-52 units, alternate loads between internal and
 226                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


external stations to the maximum extent possible. NOTE: (ARC only) One-half of the MFGs for
which an individual is certified must be loaded quarterly (100 percent semi-annually) to maintain
certification and provide evaluation of load crew proficiency. Units will rotate munitions within
a MFG for MPRLs, e.g., load MK82 Low Drag (LD) the first quarter, MK82 AIR / High Drag
(HD) the second quarter, MK84 (LD) the third quarter and MK84 AIR / (HD) the fourth quarter.
However, all UCML/TTML tasked munitions will be loaded/evaluated within a time-frame not
to exceed 12 months. For those munitions where no training assets exist (CBU-97, CBU-105,
M129, etc.) difference training will be provided prior to initial certification and during recurring
academics training. Load crews in air defense/air superiority units perform proficiency loads
quarterly using all committed munitions. For B-52 units, alternate loads between internal and
external stations to the maximum extent possible.
   12.14.1. Proficiency Review Period. Immediately following initial certification, crews will
   load one-third of all munitions monthly for a minimum of three months, after which Lead
   Crew (with LSC approval) may recommend placing them in the normal bi-monthly
   evaluation cycle (not applicable for short tour locations and ARC).
   12.14.2. Load nuclear PMs monthly. Only one type of munition within a MFG requires
   loading each month. Nuclear SMs (certified crews), to include single missile, single bomb
   and, payload exchange (for bombers), are loaded/accomplished at least quarterly. For B-52
   OPLAN 8010, internal, external, and integrated loads will be rotated monthly within each
   quarter. Launcher will include post-load checks (MIT/BIT). Single missile/bomb loading will
   include (SIT/BIT) annually.
   12.14.3. MHU-196/204 mate/de-mate operations with live or inert munitions require initial
   certification and will be evaluated semi-annually.
   12.14.4. Load crew integrity must be used to the maximum extent possible. In the event a
   crew member(s) is coded and unavailable to load, schedule the remaining crew member(s)
   with another crew as necessary to accomplish training.
       12.14.4.1. (ARC Only) Certified Load Crew Chiefs may perform MPRLs in any
       position provided they load under the supervision of LSC/Lead Crew using inert training
       munitions only. This stipulation applies at home station only. No MPRL credit will be
       given to those individuals during evaluations unless loading in the position for which
       they are certified. This deviation from policy enables units the flexibility to evaluate
       remaining crew members when a member may not be available to form a full crew and
       will only be used as a necessary.
   12.14.5. (B-52) Those crews certified for single missile loading/unloading will alternate
   between internal, external, AGM-129, and AGM-86B.
   12.14.6. MPRL credit may be given to load crews or personnel performing DLOs or other
   loading operations on the flightline during exercises, extended deployments or daily
   operations provided complete loads that satisfy MPRL requirements are performed and
   evaluated from start to finish. The required number of evaluators, equipment and all other
   requirements must be met to receive credit for these type evaluations. MPRL credit during
   flightline evaluations is only authorized when loading lives, dummy air training missiles
   (DATM), or D-2 type inert munitions.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         227


12.15. Load Crew Semi-Annual Evaluations. The LSC evaluates each load crew once semi-
annually on at least one of the unit PMs (SM or LM if no PM listed); all unit PMs will be used
on a rotating basis. Load crew integrity will be maintained to the maximum extent possible.
Decertify load crews failing to accomplish semi-annual evaluations on all munitions unless
exempted IAW provisions in this chapter. SAE’s are not required for lead crews. If an integrated
load is accomplished as the SAE (e.g., AIM-9, -120), document the SAE accordingly. There is
no need to document both SAE and MPRL. NOTE: (ARC Only) CSO (A-10, F-15, F-16) and
DLO (bombers only) procedures may be used to fulfill these requirements provided the entire
load is evaluated. Certified Load Crew Chiefs may perform SAEs in any position provided they
load under the supervision of LSC/Lead Crew using inert conventional training munitions only.
This stipulation applies at home station only. No SAE credit will be given to those individuals
during evaluations unless loading in the position for which they are certified. This deviation from
policy enables units the flexibility to evaluate remaining crew members when a member may not
be available to form a full crew and will only be used as a necessary.
12.16. Documenting Load Crew Training. Manage load crew certifications, qualifications,
SAEs and MPRLs by means of the WLCMT or equivalent. All decertification and subsequent
recertification actions must be documented.
   12.16.1. The LSC maintains load crew records in the WLCMT or equivalent system used.
   Include the following documents as a minimum: AF IMT 2435 (or equivalent) (front and
   back) for each crew member and AF IMT 2419 recording the most current semi-annual
   evaluation. AF IMT 2419’s must be maintained for all loads. Maintain either electronic or
   paper copies of AF IMT 2419s for a minimum of 1 year.
   12.16.2. If the UCML/TTML contains more than one item from MFG table, the MFG is
   entered. MFGs are listed as a single entry using the primary tasked item of the group in the
   title. For example, MK-82 MFG is entered when the MK-82 is the primary tasked item from
   its group. Separate entries are made for postload checks (if applicable). After initial training
   on applicable items within the MFG, treat the MFG as a single item and document
   certification using one line entry in block 7 of the AF IMT 2435 or locally devised form.
   12.16.3. Dates are entered upon certification and DLO qualification. Entries in date and
   certification fields on AF IMT 2435, (or equivalent), are deleted for other qualification items.
   12.16.4. Enter one of the following codes in the month column as applicable. If required
   loads are not completed and provisions of this chapter apply, use one of the following:
   temporary duty (TD), emergency leave (LV), incapacitated (ED), exercises/contingency
   (EX), or weather (WX). Code outs are not to be abused or used as a substitute for ineffective
   scheduling (WWM has final decision authority on coding disputes). The letter "E" is placed
   after the date for the semi-annual evaluation regardless of rating.
   12.16.5. Route AF IMT 2419 after semi-annual evaluations to the weapons section NCOIC,
   MX SUPT/Operations Officer, WWM, and LSC.
   12.16.6. Send printouts from the Load Crew Management database with the crew to TDY
   locations if loading tasks are to be performed. The following statement is added after the last
   entry on each product: "AF IMT 2435 reviewed; the member is certified/qualified on the
   items listed on this product." This statement is followed by the signature and date of a WS
   certifying official.
 228                                              AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   12.16.7. Academic and qualification training conducted by the WS is normally documented
   in a MIS, however the WLCMT (or equivalent) may be used for this purpose.
12.17. Transient       Aircraft     Responsibilities. Arming,        de-arming,      and    munitions
loading/unloading will only be accomplished on transient aircraft to facilitate required
maintenance actions. In such cases, these operations on transient aircraft may be performed by
any weapons load crew certified/qualified on the munition and aircraft. The MXG/CC may direct
the LSC or a lead crew to arm, de-arm, and unload an aircraft on which they are not
certified/qualified, if appropriate technical data and support equipment is available. In such
cases, the aircrew will be available for consultations on aircraft to verify flight worthiness of load
configuration, and to perform cockpit portions of required functional/stray voltage checks. If
these cannot be met, request help from owning unit(s)/higher headquarters. Local procedures
must be developed to control impulse cartridges removed from transient aircraft.
12.18. Dual Loading Operations (DLO). DLO is only applicable to conventional munitions
loading operations in bomber units (MAJCOM approval required for fighter units). DLOs are the
primary method for rapid munitions loading/unloading on bomber aircraft and are authorized
provided the following conditions are met:
   12.18.1. Both internal and external (B-52) or dual bay (B-1, B-2) loading is required.
   12.18.2. Load crew chiefs: Designate one crew chief to be in charge of the entire operation.
       12.18.2.1. One will check the aircraft AFTO Form/IMT 781 and verify aircraft and
       armament system status prior to start of the load and brief status during the pre-task
       briefing.
       12.18.2.2. Both are present during the pre-task briefing.
       12.18.2.3. Verify all previously loaded munitions are in pre-maintenance status.
       12.18.2.4. One will verify cockpit switches are properly positioned during aircraft
       preparation.
       12.18.2.5. Both will check off each step as they are accomplished in their applicable
       loading checklist.
   12.18.3. Load crews conduct independent loading operations from single or separate trailers.
   NOTE: Loading and fueling operations must not be performed simultaneously due to the
   hazard of the aircraft settling.
   12.18.4. Post-load power-on checks are not accomplished until all munitions are loaded and
   bay connections accomplished.
   12.18.5. Load crew chiefs ensure that the conventional system switches/controls are properly
   positioned and verify the conventional munitions status and inventory during post-loading
   inspection.
   12.18.6. Initial DLO qualification consists of academic and practical training. Recurring
   training only consists of academic training.
12.19. Weapons Task Qualification. A weapons task qualification is a munitions related task
that does not require certification. Individuals require both initial/recurring weapons academics
and initial and annual practical qualification training for these tasks. Recurring practical training
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         229


should be conducted during normal flightline operations to the maximum extent. Training is
provided, documented and tracked by the WS.
   12.19.1. Checklist Qualification: Indicates that the person with the checklist is trained,
   knowledgeable and in-charge of the overall operation or task. Member’s must possess a 5-
   skill level minimum to be checklist qualified.
   12.19.2. Full scale inert/training munitions (e.g., BDU-50/TGM-65/CATM-120). If load
   crew personnel are certified on a munition, they are considered qualified (by position
   certified, except #1 position) on its inert version. In the event the load crew member is not
   certified on an SM or LM, then load crew personnel require annual training on the
   inert/training version and it will also be tracked as a qualification. If crew personnel are not
   certified on the live version and the inert/training munition is a standalone SM or LM, then
   load crew personnel require annual training on the inert/training version and it will also be
   tracked as a qualification.
   12.19.3. Two or more qualified personnel in AFSC 2W1X1 (or civilian equivalent) may
   perform the following tasks:
      12.19.3.1. Practice Bombs: load and unload BDU-33, BDU-48 and MK-106.
      12.19.3.2. Load and unload ammunition in internal and external gun systems (the GAU-
      8 requires three people). Exception, personnel are authorized to unload (only)
      ammunition in the GAU-2, GAU-18 or M240 caliber machine guns during Hot Gun
      emergency or gun jams that require safing prior to maintenance actions.
      12.19.3.3. Load and unload single 2.75 rockets.
      12.19.3.4. Load and unload Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) (three person
      minimum).
   12.19.4. Two or more qualified personnel in any aircraft maintenance AFSC may perform
   the following tasks (members must be qualified in all aspects of task to be performed; i.e.,
   aircraft prep, rack/launcher prep, munitions prep, etc.):
      12.19.4.1. Install and remove impulse cartridges if the task is not accomplished as a part
      of a loading operation.
      12.19.4.2. (Bomber aircraft) Install and remove practice bomb adapter rack and cluster
      rack adapters.
      12.19.4.3. Load/unload pyrotechnics.
      12.19.4.4. Install and remove chaff and flare magazines and other defensive
      countermeasures.
      12.19.4.5. Perform portions of the conventional loading checklist pertaining to delayed-
      flight or alert, and IPL/safing procedures (NOTE: Removal of dome cover(s) is not
      considered IPL and does not require initial/recurring academics).
      12.19.4.6. Perform munitions/missile isolation procedures to facilitate other maintenance
      on conventional loaded aircraft only.
      12.19.4.7. Install and remove captive AIM-9 missiles (must have one checklist qualified
      load crew member), Acceleration Monitor Assemblies (AMA) and Airborne
 230                                              AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


        Instrumentation System (AIS) pods. Academics is not required for AMA and AIS pods.
        (Minimum crew size per TO directives). AMA and AIS qualification training are a
        onetime trained item that will be entered on a AF IMT 797.
        12.19.4.8. (ANG alert facilities only) Install and remove Argon (TMU-72 coolant tank)
        in AIM/ CATM-9.
   12.19.5. A weapons load crew chief does not require qualification to perform tasks on which
   they are certified to load in respect to parent munitions (inert/training munitions only). Other
   load crew members must be qualified to perform any portion of these tasks for which they
   have not been certified. To clarify, the load crew chief may perform in any crew member
   position when loading inert/training munitions if certified on the parent munition. The two
   and three members can only perform those positions for which they are certified or qualified
   in. (Use of #1 to load in the #2 or #3 position must be kept to a minimum.) Utilization of this
   practice will only be used when assigned manning dictates. Use of by position-qualified
   personnel will be the standard practice, until no other means are available within the unit.
12.20. Munitions Load Time Standards. All munitions listed in a single block comprise a
MFG for the respective aircraft mission type. The load time standards apply to all operational
users of the munitions or aircraft listed and are the minimum proficiency requirements for
weapons load crews. Units may establish more restrictive standards for local use. Unless
otherwise Noted in Table 12.1 through Table 12.3, the WS Superintendent shall determine and
set load time standards for qualification items, for integrated loads (including nuclear, if tasked),
and for loads performed wearing CWDE. All items require certification in accordance with this
chapter, except as Noted.
   12.20.1. The standard load times, from the MFG Table 12.1-Table 12.3, are standard load
   times for initial and recurring "WLT" training and evaluations for the respective single store
   (including full munitions preparation) and installation of impulse cartridges, if required.
   Except for BRU-57, an additional 10 minutes is allowed for each added aircraft station check
   on fighter aircraft, if performed as part of an evaluated load. An additional 7 minutes is
   allowed for each like store added to fighter aircraft loads. Load times are additive when more
   than one type of munition is loaded on fighter aircraft. For example, if an F-16 is to be loaded
   with two AIM-9s and a MK-82, the load crew shall be allowed 20 minutes for the first AIM-
   9, 7 minutes for the second AIM-9, and 25 minutes for the MK-82, for a total of 52 minutes.
   Loads may be accomplished without full munitions preparations, however, more restrictive
   time standards must be developed. Units should develop optimum time standards for
   integrated loads (including nuclear, if tasked).

          MOBILITY AIRCRAFT DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS LOADING POLICY

13.1. Units required to install/remove chaff/flare on mobility aircraft. (i.e., C-5, C-17, C-
130), will establish a program to train and qualify personnel to perform these tasks IAW
procedures outlined in this chapter. Units will also work with the local explosives safety officer
and airfield management to develop an OI for handling chaff/flare-loaded aircraft IAW AFMAN
91-201 and AFI 91-202. As a minimum, the OI will include procedures for
launch/recovery/parking of chaff/flare-loaded aircraft; chaff/flare storage and transportation; and
partially ejected flares. The MXG/CC will appoint a 7/9-level individual with maintenance
AFSC as the Weapons Task Qualification Manager (WTQM). NOTE: Units with 2W1s
assigned will comply with training/qualification requirements outlined in Chapter 12.
13.2. The WTQM and the Weapons Task Qualification. Crew (WTQC) ensure chaff/flare
loading operations are conducted safely, provide initial and recurring load training, serve as the
focal point for all chaff/flare loading issues, and observe load operations during training. The
WTQM and WTQC will not participate in load operations during training.
   13.2.1. Weapons Task Qualification Manager. The WTQM develops and oversees the
   chaff/flare loading standardization program, sets standards, and develops local policies and
   procedures. The WTQM is typically a 2A573C, however, other flightline 2AX7X personnel
   may perform this function. Individuals appointed as the WTQM will be tracked on the SCR.
   The WTQM will:
       13.2.1.1. Receive initial and recurring load qualification training from a WTQC and
       maintain currency on chaff/flare loading tasks. Once trained, they will develop and
       administer the unit’s chaff/ flare load training program. NOTE: In the event a unit is
       initially tasked and has no qualified instructors, it will be necessary for the WTQM to
       become certified at a unit with qualified trainers. Once the WTQM is trained and
       qualified, they can train and qualify home station WTQC personnel.
       13.2.1.2. Select, train, evaluate, and qualify a minimum of two personnel as the WTQC
       on safe and reliable munitions loading procedures. Evaluate and re-certify WTQC
       members annually. WTQC members will be tracked on the SCR.
       13.2.1.3. Ensure sufficient numbers of personnel are chaff/flare loading qualified to
       support the unit’s mission. As a minimum, identify the number of qualified personnel,
       names and employee numbers, MDS qualification, Defensive Systems (DS) equipment
       type, qualification date, and date(s) recurring training is due.
           13.2.1.3.1. Ensure a course code is loaded in the MIS to identify trained personnel
           and qualification status.
       13.2.1.4. Establish time standards for initial and recurring loading tasks. The senior
       evaluator has the discretion to add to the time standard if inclement weather or equipment
       failure is the cause for exceeding the time standard. AMC lead wings will develop time
       standards for each MDS for qualification purposes.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       235


       13.2.1.5. Review and approve/disapprove AFTO IMTs 22 that pertain to chaff/flare
       loading technical data.
       13.2.1.6. Utilizing AMC lead wing developed MDS specific Task Assignment Lists
       (TALs), develop a local TALs for use during training for all chaff/flare loading
       operations A TAL is derived from applicable MDS munitions load checklist (33-1-2
       series TO) and identifies the load crewmember’s responsibilities by step.
       13.2.1.7. Ensure chaff/flare loading CTKs are standardized to the maximum extent
       possible. Chaff/flare loading CTKs must include all tools and equipment necessary to
       support applicable MDSs and AME configurations.
       13.2.1.8. Coordinate the scheduling of personnel for chaff/flare load training. The
       WTQM may delegate this duty to the WTQC.
       13.2.1.9. Coordinate with PS&D, or the RTC, if applicable, to obtain chaff/flare
       dispensing system-equipped aircraft for training purposes.
       13.2.1.10. Ensure training magazines match the characteristics and “feel” of live
       magazines (e.g., weight, dimensions).
   13.2.2. Weapons Task Qualification Crew. The WTQC assists the WTQM in managing the
   chaff/ flare loading standardization program. The WTQC’s primary purpose is to train and
   qualify personnel to load chaff/flares, but may also perform chaff/flare load duties. The lead
   WTQC member is typically a 7-level 2A5X3C technician. Initial training will be conducted
   using inert munitions. The number of trained WTQC members should be based on
   current/anticipated workloads and their ability to maintain proficiency on all applicable
   MDSs. WTQC members are qualified by the WTQM. The WTQC members will:
       13.2.2.1. Provide personnel with initial and recurring load qualification training. One
       WTQC member is required to conduct practical training.
       13.2.2.2. Monitor personnel qualifications to ensure required academic and practical
       training is complete. Disqualify individuals if recurring requirements are not met.
       13.2.2.3. Spot-check personnel to evaluate proficiency. Disqualify personnel who violate
       safety, technical data, and reliability procedures, or fail to demonstrate proficiency.
       13.2.2.4. Develop/coordinate training schedules and provide to PS&D for inclusion in
       the appropriate schedule (e.g., monthly, weekly). NOTE: Enroute WTQMs forward
       training requirements to the unit training manager, who coordinates for ground training
       aircraft with the RTC.
13.3. Training Requirements. Personnel are considered qualified upon successful completion
of training provided by a qualified WTQC. Document initial load qualification training in GO81
or equivalent system and the individual’s CFETP. Document recurring load qualification training
in the qualification status system (GO81). Initial qualification will be conducted using inert
munitions. Live munitions may be used during annual qualification to maintain currency. Load
qualification training consists of academic and practical training.
   13.3.1. Academic and practical training must be provided during initial and recurring load
   qualification training.
 236                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       13.3.1.1. Academic training is required before practical training is accomplished. Initial
       Practical training must be completed within 14 days of satisfactorily completing initial
       academic training.
       13.3.1.2. Practical training should duplicate operational conditions as closely as possible.
          13.3.1.2.1. Recurring practical task qualification is administered at least annually.
          13.3.1.2.2. As a minimum, practical training will include chaff/flare module
          serviceability criteria, actual chaff/flare loading, and operation of support
          equipment/AGE used during loading operations. NOTE: Weapons task qualification
          academic training may fulfill the requirements for explosive safety training if the
          requirements of AFI 91-202 are included.
       13.3.1.3. Academic training is administered every 12 months. As a minimum, academic
       training will include:
          13.3.1.3.1. Familiarization with chaff/flare loading publications, including TO 11A-
          1-33, Handling and Maintenance on Explosives Loaded Aircraft, Lead Command and
          local procedures.
          13.3.1.3.2. Aircraft and munitions familiarization.
          13.3.1.3.3. Safety, security, and emergency procedures.
          13.3.1.3.4. Support, test, handling equipment, and special tools familiarization.
          13.3.1.3.5. TALs and aircraft specific 33-1-2 series TOs must be available at the
          load-training site. NOTE: Training course control documents will be coordinated
          annually through the wing weapons safety office and the MTF.
       13.3.1.4. Personnel qualified on a specific task on a specific MDS are considered
       qualified to perform that task on all series of that MDS; however, the member must be
       familiar with differences within the MDS (e.g. cockpit switch locations). The WTQM or
       WTQC provide practical, on-aircraft training on these differences and document these
       qualifications for each dispensing system in the qualification status system.
13.4. Disqualifying Chaff/Flare Load Personnel. Document disqualification in the member’s
CFETP and the qualification status system.
   13.4.1. Although not all-inclusive, the following criteria constitute grounds for disqualifying
   personnel from chaff/flare loading duties:
       13.4.1.1. Failing to complete recurring training.
       13.4.1.2. Committing a safety or reliability error.
       13.4.1.3. Lack of proficiency.
13.5. Transient Aircraft.
   13.5.1. Apply the following when working transient aircraft:
       13.5.1.1. Under NO circumstances will personnel attempt chaff/flare load operations
       without technical data.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       237


       13.5.1.2. If technical data is available, then qualified personnel may perform chaff/flare
       load operations.
       13.5.1.3. If technical data is available but no one is qualified on the transient aircraft
       type, then the MXG/CC (or AMS/CC at en route locations) may authorize the WTQC or
       WTQM to de-arm and/ or unload the aircraft. The WTQM will submit a written request
       to the MXG/CC (or AMS/CC at en route locations) identifying personnel selected to
       perform the task, aircraft type and (if applicable) number of aircraft to be dearmed and
       unloaded. Maintain approved requests for 90 days. NOTE: This is a temporary, one-time
       authorization to facilitate required maintenance when qualified personnel are not
       available.
13.6. Identification of Chaff/Flare-Loaded Aircraft. Verify chaff/flare load status of aircraft
by checking AFTO IMTs 781A/C/H before performing any maintenance. Armament placards are
not required on AMC aircraft. If an aircraft is loaded with chaff/flare, it will be safed IAW
applicable technical data prior to performing any maintenance.
   13.6.1. Before loading chaff/flares, review the AFTO Form/IMT 781C, Avionics
   Configuration and Load Status Document, for Defensive Systems (DS) inspection status. If
   chaff/flare is loaded on AMC aircraft, annotate G081 using program 9018. NOTE: Do not
   load chaff/flares if the aircraft is overdue a scheduled DS inspection.
13.7. AF IMT 2434 Requirements. Annotate the AF IMT 2434, on all aircraft configured and
loaded to release or fire chaff/flares. Record the number and type of chaff/flares in the
appropriate munitions column. A locally developed form may be used as long as it includes all
AF IMT 2434 data elements.
   13.7.1. The following procedures pertain to reconciliation of AF IMT 2434 (or equivalent)
   and reconciliation responsibilities:
       13.7.1.1. Reconcile and verify expenditures during aircraft debrief. Maintenance and
       operations personnel shall develop procedures to capture expenditure data after each
       sortie where applicable.
       13.7.1.2. Flightline expediter will ensure visual reconciliation is complete.
       13.7.1.3. Homestation reconciliation data is provided to the unit MASO.
       13.7.1.4. For en route aircraft loaded at homestation, forward the AF IMT 2434 (or
       equivalent) reconciliation data through the Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG)
       munitions POC to the applicable homestation MASO.
       13.7.1.5. For aircraft loaded at en route units, forward the AF IMT 2434 (or equivalent)
       reconciliation data through the AMOG munitions POC to the applicable host unit.
13.8. AMC requires: AMC requires documenting DS software version data and aircraft
inspections (e.g., 90-, 120-, or 180-day checks) on AFTO Form/IMT 781C. For software version
data, enter the following information in the ―Remarks‖ section for each reprogrammable
system: type system; installed Operational Flight Program (OFP) version; and/or Mission Data
File (MDF) version (e.g., ALE-47, OFP XXXX, MDF XXXX). If a system contains multiple
OFPs, list all applicable versions (e.g., ALE-47, Programmer OFP XXXX, Sequencer OFP
XXXX, MDF XXXX).

      14.2.1.1. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). TTPs provide maintenance
      activities flexible preparation and response options in a CBRNE environment. The intent
      is to employ AF and locally-developed TTPs to maximize combat sortie operations while
      operating in a CBRNE environment IAW AFMAN 10-2602. TTPs provide sortie
      generation activities with fundamental counter-chemical warfare (CCW) tools to survive
      and fight.
14.3. Aircraft Grounding.
   14.3.1. Definition. On occasion, units may discover conditions in multiple aircraft, engines,
   missiles, munitions, or related installed flight equipment of sufficient risk to personal injury
   or equipment damage that warrant fleet grounding consideration from a higher echelon of
   command until the matter can be properly investigated and resolved. Grounding is an
   administrative action taken to prohibit aircraft from flying because of a specific condition
   related to the aircraft or based on requirements of a directive
      14.3.1.1. This section does not apply to conditions which are clearly limited to the
      affected unit/base (e.g., lost tool, fluid contamination, aircraft/equipment damage of
      known origin, or other strictly local event). In these circumstances, the affected unit will
      follow Impoundment procedures specified in Chapter 9.
   14.3.2. Initial Investigation. The owning MXG/CC or equivalent will direct QA to develop a
   local OTI IAW TO 00-20-1 of this instruction. The OTI will require a sampling of affected
   aircraft, engines, missiles, or munitions to quickly assess the extent of the discrepancy within
   the wing’s assigned aircraft. If there is no repair or corrective action specified in technical
   data, QA will also submit a technical assistance request through the MAJCOM to the System
   Program Manager IAW TO 00-25-107. If initial sampling indicates the discrepancy is
   widespread and has the potential for personal injury and/or further equipment damage, the
   MXG/CC will discuss aircraft grounding with the WG/CC and forward a recommendation to
   the MAJCOM.
      14.3.2.1. Documentation. Annotate Aerospace Equipment forms IAW TO 00-20-1.
   14.3.3. Grounding Authority. MAJCOM Commanders may direct grounding of MDS-
   specific or all aircraft within their commands for maintenance reasons. When a MAJCOM
   has lead command aircraft responsibility, MAJCOM commanders may recommend
   grounding of all aircraft within an MDS-specific fleet. Notification will be provided IAW
   AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Return to normal operations will be initiated by the
   commander directing the original grounding. The authority for grounding may be delegated
   by MAJCOMs in supplements to this and other governing AFIs, but not lower than
   MAJCOM/A4s. (ANG will follow grounding authority guidance outlined in AFI 11-401)
242                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      14.3.3.1. The MAJCOM/A4 will determine if the risk of injury and/or damage is
      significant enough to ground all like-MDS aircraft. The MAJCOM/A4 will coordinate
      with the MAJCOM/A3 and consult with the System Program Manager, as required, prior
      to recommending the MAJCOM/CC make the decision to ground. Grounding decisions
      will be communicated via the OPREP reporting system.
         14.3.3.1.1. MAJCOMs will accomplish the following actions: determine the impact
         of fleet grounding on operational capability worldwide; ensure other operating
         commands are informed of the fleetwide potential of the grounding discrepancy;
         notify the AEF Center if grounding affects the capability to contribute to joint or
         contingency operations; coordinate with AFMC and other commands to
         provide/obtain advice and direction, as necessary; and coordinate final grounding
         disposition with affected MAJCOM and AEF Commanders.
      14.3.3.2. In certain cases, the System Program Manager, versus an operational unit, will
      discover a materiel condition with fleetwide impact and will recommend the
      MAJCOM/CC ground the fleet, or, in some instances direct immediate grounding IAW
      authority granted to the System Program Manager in TO 00-5-15.
      14.3.3.3. In the case of a deployed unit that is not assigned/attached to a MAJCOM the
      grounding decision will be made by the Joint/Combined Force Air Component
      Commander (JFACC/CFACC).
      14.3.3.4. (DELETED)
      14.3.3.5. Documentation. Annotate Aerospace Equipment forms IAW TO 00-20-1.
  14.3.4. Release from Grounding.
      14.3.4.1. When a grounding condition requires System Program Manager involvement,
      the System Program Manager engineering function will investigate and recommend a
      course of action to the submitting MAJCOM IAW TO 00-5-15. The MAJCOM/A4 will
      consult with the MAJCOM/CC to confirm conditions for the release from grounding via
      the following methods; for Unclassified Messages: Official NIPR E-mail; digitally signed
      and encrypted using the Common Access Card (CAC) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
      for Classified Messages: Official SIPR E-mail. If the corrective action is published as an
      immediate action TCTO or other certified repair data, individual aircraft compliance
      constitutes their return to service. If aircraft are grounded by a HAF authority then
      coordinate for release through AF/A4L coordination.
      14.3.4.2. If the corrective action is issued as a routine TCTO or no corrective action is
      required for unaffected aircraft (i.e., after investigation, the situation does not pose
      imminent risk to the entire fleet), the affected MAJCOM/CC will issue a follow-on email
      as described in 14.3.4.1 to affected units/commands releasing the grounding order and
      specifying conditions for returning to flying operations.
      14.3.4.3. Units will annotate release from grounding by clearing the discrepancy IAW
      System Program Manager provided TCTO/repair data and/or TO 00-20-1. If the
      corrective action is deferred to routine TCTO, next phase/isochronal, etc., clear the
      discrepancy IAW MAJCOM/A4 direction and enter the appropriate data for the deferred
      job.

       14.3.4.4. Final reporting for grounding and release status will be accomplished IAW AFI
       10-206, Operational Reporting.
   14.3.5. Stand-down for Operational Reasons. For these situations, refer to AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management.
14.4. Aircraft Inlet/Intake/Exhaust Certification.
   14.4.1. This program is applicable to installed engines on B-1, B-2, F-4, F-15, F-16, F-22,
   and F-35 aircraft. Lead Commands may direct this program to apply to other MDSs. Affected
   units will develop a comprehensive training program to ensure personnel are knowledgeable
   and proficient in the performance of intake/ inlet/exhaust inspections. The number of
   individuals authorized to perform engine intake/inlet/ exhaust inspections should be
   sufficient to meet mission requirements and production needs, and ensure competency
   through regular performance. Authorized AFSCs are specified in Table 14.1; however, based
   on manning considerations, the MXG/CC may approve personnel in other AFSCs to perform
   inlet/exhaust inspections. NOTE: Do not confuse this certification program with ground
   maintenance FO inspections.
   14.4.2. Responsibilities and Management. The MTF/TD, in coordination with SMEs, will be
   responsible for development and management of the engine inlet/intake/exhaust inspection
   training program. Certifiers will be appointed by the MXG/CC and tracked on the SCR IAW
   Table 14.1 of this instruction.
   14.4.3. Formal Training. MTF/TD in coordination with the SME will develop and conduct
   training. As a minimum, courses will include dangers associated with the
   intake/inlet/exhaust, care and handling of equipment, applicable technical data, FOD
   prevention, inspection criteria, fault isolation/ damage assessment, techniques required to
   inspect engine intakes, inlets and exhausts and performance of an engine intake/inlet/exhaust
   inspection. Formal training and certification are mandatory prior to placement on the SCR.
       14.4.3.1. Certified individuals who PCS to the same MDS and engine TMSM may by-
       pass a formal training course. These individuals must be re-certified prior to being added
       to the SCR. Carry over date of original class completion from previous documentation
       (certificate, training record, MIS printout).
   14.4.4. Certification Criteria. Upon completion of formal training, individuals are task
   evaluated by a certifying official (an individual other than the instructor who administered
   the course), and placed on the SCR. Certifying officials will be appointed by the MXG/CC
   IAW Table 14.1. Units will limit the number of certifiers to a minimum to ensure
   standardized training and certification. Certifying officials will maintain proficiency in the
   same manner as other technicians; certifying officials will recertify each other.
       14.4.4.1. Annual Recertification. Each certified technician is required to be recertified
       annually by a certifying official. Recertification is accomplished by having the technician
       demonstrate they can perform the task(s). A QA PE may be used to satisfy this
       requirement if the QA evaluator is a certifying official.
14.5. Aircraft Rapid/Hot Defueling.
   14.5.1. Rapid/hot defueling is authorized for aircraft identified in TO 00-25-172. Rapid
   defueling reduces time and provides a means to rapidly off load fuel from aircraft at a higher
 244                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   flow rate than defueling systems and equipment are capable of providing. MXG/CC or
   equivalent designates a unit OPR for rapid/hot defueling training.
   14.5.2. Rapid defueling operations are considered hot defueling operations whenever the
   provider/source aircraft has an engine running.
   14.5.3. Rapid defueling presents hazards which are not normally encountered in normal
   defueling operations. Precautions and instructions contained in TO 00-25-172 and applicable
   aircraft TO’s shall be followed when performing rapid/hot defuel operations.
       14.5.3.1. All rapid defueling ground crew members will be qualified to perform rapid/hot
       defueling operations by a qualified trainer. Training will be documented in the individual
       training plan in the WJQS or JQS. These individuals also require annual refresher
       training. Recurring training will be tracked in the applicable MIS. The rapid/hot defuel
       supervisor will be certified annually and tracked on the SCR.
   14.5.4. During aircraft to aircraft ground transfer operations, if the provider aircraft has at
   least one engine running, it is considered a hot/rapid defueling operation.
       14.5.4.1. Aircraft to Aircraft refuel procedures will only be accomplished with prior
       Lead Command approval.
14.6. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP).
   14.6.1. The aircraft structural integrity and flight loads data recording/individual aircraft
   tracking programs are established by applicable MDS specific TOs, and AFI 63-1001 and
   require coordinated action by a number of base level maintenance activities. An effective
   structural data collection program is essential to establish, assess and support inspections,
   maintenance activities, repairs and required modification/replacement actions.
   14.6.2. The MXG/CC or equivalent ensures an effective ASIP is established, appoints an
   officer or NCO as the unit ASIP project officer, and ensures effective measures are in place
   to capture ASIP data.
   14.6.3. The MXG ASIP project officer will:
       14.6.3.1. Act as POC for a local ASIP OI. As a minimum, the OI will address:
          14.6.3.1.1. Identification of maintenance activities responsible for changing and
          submitting storage media.
          14.6.3.1.2. Appointment of ASIP monitors.

      tape was shipped.
      14.6.5.3. Coordinate with appropriate Pro Super to CANN ASIP related parts.
      14.6.5.4. Inform the MXG ASIP project officer of backordered parts with unacceptable
      delivery dates, difficulties in acquiring tapes, etc.
      14.6.5.5. PS&D section will ensure ASIP equipped aircraft are identified in weekly
      schedules (if required) and jacket files for these aircraft are clearly marked to show ASIP
      equipment is installed.
      14.6.5.6. Debriefers will ensure appropriate ASIP documents are available at the
      debriefing location and ASIP data is gathered for each sortie flown by ASIP equipped
      aircraft.
   14.6.6. Inspection Dock NCOIC Responsibilities (as applicable by MDS).
      14.6.6.1. Establish JSTs with the required ASIP inspections. Ensure all ASIP inspections
      are complied with prior to closing out the inspection. NOTE: Classified ASIP will be
      managed with Lead Command-approved procedures to ensure safeguarding of classified
      information.
      14.6.6.2. PS&D will ensure ASIP inspections are loaded in the MIS and scheduled.
      NOTE: Classified ASIP will be managed with Lead Command-approved procedures to
      ensure safeguarding of classified information. NOTE: When required by lead
      Command, units may be asked to establish POCs for other related programs or data
      collection efforts. Refer to AFI 63-1401, Aircraft Information Program.
14.7. Hydraulic Fluid Purification (HFP):
   14.7.1. Lead Commands will make HFP equipment procurement/modification a priority.
   Immediately implement the following process upon receipt of required equipment.
   14.7.2. All aircraft maintenance organizations shall perform hydraulic fluid purification
   IAW applicable aircraft guidelines.
      14.7.2.1. AGE personnel will purify all aircraft use Hydraulic Test Stands (HTS)
      modified for purifier connection. Complete IAW prescribed technical procedures and
      purify for one hour after all HTS hydraulic system maintenance or when adding
      additional hydraulic fluid. Modified hydraulic servicing carts are subject to the same
      guidance but only require a 15 minute purification process.
      14.7.2.2. Flightline users will perform any additional purification operations IAW
      prescribed aircraft technical procedures as needed. NOTE: HFP is not a reclamation
      process. It will remove particles, air and moisture but not contaminants such as chemicals
      and other petroleum products.
14.8. Cannibalization Program.
246                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


  14.8.1. General: CANN actions may be necessary when a condition prevents the
  accomplishment of a mission and the required assets are not immediately available from
  supply. Prior to performing a CANN action, verify the required component cannot be
  sourced from LRS, TNB or back shop assets prior to impacting aircraft mission
  accomplishment. When authorizing a CANN, the expenditure of man-hours and potential
  damage to equipment must be weighed against the expected benefit. High risk CANNs
  should not be performed unless priority aircraft are involved or lack of ready equipment will
  impede mission accomplishment. See Table 1.1 NOTE: Commanders should not
  necessarily view high CANN rates as a negative statistic that reflects poorly on the unit’s
  capability or production effort. CANN rates accurately record the lack of asset availability to
  the field.
  14.8.2. Definition: CANN is the authorized removal of a specific assembly, subassembly, or
  part from one weapon system, system, support system, or equipment end item for installation
  on another end item to satisfy an existing supply requisition and to meet priority mission
  requirements with an obligation to replace the removed item. Weapon systems, support
  systems, or equipment include: aircraft, missiles, drones, RPA, uninstalled engines,
  uninstalled engine modules, aircrew and/or launch crew training devices, C-E equipment,
  AGE, TMDE, serviceable uninstalled ECM pods, and guns.
  14.8.3. Authorization & Control: Commanders, managers, and supervisors will closely
  control CANN actions. Although immediate benefits can be realized, the process results in
  excess expenditures of maintenance resources and may degrade readiness by exposing
  serviceable equipment to extra handling, assembly, disassembly or removal and
  reinstallation, and follow-on operational checks.
  14.8.4. CANN authorities (CA) will be approved by the MXG/CC or equivalent and tracked
  in the MIS. CA will be SNCOs and officers (or civilian equivalents). These personnel are
  normally Pro Supers. Personnel permitted to authorize CANN actions must be kept to a
  minimum. Those who are authorized to approve CANNs will not further delegate their
  responsibility.
  14.8.5. Aircraft that have been cannibalized extensively may be identified as “CANN
  aircraft.” Aircraft designated as CANN aircraft will have an assigned CANN manager. This
  manager will ensure daily documentation actions (forms/tags/MIS) remain accurate and
  complete.
  14.8.6. If an assembly is cannibalized to satisfy a condition caused by lack of bits and pieces
  (e.g., washers, nuts, and bolts), the assembly is counted as a CANN and the bits and pieces
  are considered transfer actions. Bits and pieces removed from an end item (without removing
  the assembly) for installation on another end item are considered individual CANN actions.
  NOTE: An item will not be cannibalized solely to attain a MC rate or any other maintenance
  metric.
  14.8.7. When a required part cannot be delivered and installed on time, the CA may approve
  the CANN of parts before the initiation of CANN documentation (e.g., Red Ball
  maintenance). The CA will give this approval only after confirming the part is not readily
  available in LRS,TNB, launch trucks, forward supply points, or back shops. The CA will
  notify the appropriate supply activity to change the “mark-for” components in the document
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       247


   number. The CA will also ensure complete documentation is accomplished for each CANN
   action.
   14.8.8. When TCIs, serially controlled items, items affecting compliance of a TCTO, or
   other components with inspection requirements that align to specific hourly, calendar, or
   event limits are considered for CANN, the CA will coordinate with PS&D or EM to ensure
   adequate time remains on the item to justify the CANN and to ensure appropriate records are
   updated. If CANN occurs, the performing work center will update MIS and notify PS&D or
   EM.
   14.8.9. Installed engines are not end items; engines are considered LRU just as a radar
   component, gun, seat, canopy, radio, multifunction display unit, etc. If a functional LRU is
   removed from one end item to put on another end item to fill a “hole” which was caused by a
   supply requisition, (the requisition could be against the LRU), then this will be considered a
   CANN.
   14.8.10. Restrictions:
       14.8.10.1. CANN actions involving parts from ABDR aircraft, AF Museum Aircraft,
       Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs), GITA (possession purpose code TX), or DRMO
       will not be accomplished without authorization from the SPO. If the part is approved for
       CANN, it must not be put into service until all necessary inspections (e.g., NDI, pressure
       checks, operational checks, TCTOs) have been accomplished using specific guidance
       from the IM to ensure proper serviceability. Parts shall not be removed from static
       display/AF Museum Aircraft except as authorized by AFI 84-103. Aircraft possessed by
       AFMC in depot maintenance will not be cannibalized without first obtaining approval
       from the applicable AFMC single manager.
       14.8.10.2. An aircraft that has been extensively cannibalized will not be launched on an
       overseas or cross-country sortie/mission on the first flight following CANN status
       without owning MXG/CC approval.
   14.8.11. Documentation and Reporting: Specific documentation procedures for CANNs are
   prescribed in 00-20 series TOs. All CANNs will be properly recorded in the MIS and AFTO
   series forms. Aircraft recovering from CANN status will be carefully screened and all
   maintenance documentation thoroughly reviewed before being scheduled for a
   sortie/mission. The review will ensure all operational checks have been completed and will
   determine if an OCF or FCF is required.
14.9. Combat Sortie Generation. Combat sortie generation is a process by which mission
capable aircraft are generated in a minimum amount of time, during peacetime or wartime,
through separate 2AXXX and 2WXXX tasks or by Concurrent Servicing Operations (CSO).
Combat sortie generation may include fueling, munitions/ammunition loading/unloading, aircraft
reconfiguration, Dash-6 TO inspections, and other servicing requirements, IAW applicable MDS
TOs, Technical Order Data (TOD), IETM, TO 11A-1-33, TO 00-25-172 and other applicable
directives. In conjunction with applicable TOs/TODs, units will use the procedures in this
chapter to accomplish combat sortie generation. Procedures can be compressed through pre-
positioning resources and concurrent performance of tasks. When authorized by Lead Command,
abbreviated AFMC approved Dash-6 TO quick turn workcards may be used.
248                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


  14.9.1. Generation procedures should be built around the operational environment, mission,
  and expected operations for which a unit is designated to deploy or support during
  contingencies or taskings. These procedures may be used during actual contingencies,
  scheduled exercises, and daily flying operations. Combat sortie generation includes the entire
  regeneration cycle for a mission capable aircraft to include any or all of the following:
  servicing, inspection, munitions/ammunition loading/ unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, and
  fueling. When authorized by Lead Command Munitions and Aircraft maintenance divisions,
  DLOs, described in Chapter 12 of this instruction, may be used to regenerate aircraft.
  14.9.2. Concurrent Servicing Operations (CSO): The simultaneous fueling, and
  munitions/ammunition loading/unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, aircraft Dash-6 TO
  inspections, and other aircraft servicing such as oil, nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid. Oxygen
  servicing will not be accomplished during fuel servicing. CSOs provide units operational
  flexibility in managing resources and a rapid means of generating mission ready aircraft.
      14.9.2.1. CSOs requiring a Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS). The key function
      requiring the CSS is refueling/defueling and only applies to Fighter/Attack aircraft IAW
      TO 00-25-172 Chapter 6.
         14.9.2.1.1. Simultaneous fuel servicing with aircraft -6 and -6WC inspections.
         14.9.2.1.2. Simultaneous       fuel     servicing     with      munitions/ammunition
         loading/unloading.
         14.9.2.1.3. Simultaneous fuel servicing with aircraft reconfiguration.
         14.9.2.1.4. Simultaneous fuel servicing and other aircraft servicing such as oil,
         nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid.
         14.9.2.1.5. Simultaneous      fuel     servicing     with     loading/unloading    of
         munitions/ammunition, aircraft reconfiguration, aircraft Dash-6 TO inspections, and
         other aircraft servicing such as oil, nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid. NOTE: Electrical
         “power-on” portions of Dash-6 inspections are not authorized during concurrent
         munitions loading/unloading and fuel servicing operations. Power-on portions of
         Dash-6 inspections are accomplished prior to or upon completion of the concurrent
         munitions loading/unloading and fuel servicing operation.
      14.9.2.2. CSOs NOT requiring a Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS). When no
      refuel/defuel operations are taking place concurrent with any other
      maintenance/munitions tasks, a CSS is not required.
         14.9.2.2.1. Any or all simultaneous munitions/ammunition loading/unloading with
         aircraft -6 and -6WC TO inspections, aircraft reconfiguration, and other aircraft
         servicing such as oil, nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid. NOTE: When a CSS is not
         required, the weapons load crew chief is responsible for and controls all actions
         concerning the aircraft during loading and unloading operations. See Chapter 4 for
         detailed responsibilities.
  14.9.3. Lead Commands will supplement this AFI with specific requirements for 2AXXX
  and 2WXXX training and qualification, and CSS training and certification.
  14.9.4. Manpower. Commanders may train additional aircraft or munitions maintenance
  personnel to assist in direct sortie generation production activities.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                    249

         and AFOSHSTDs.
  14.9.6. Combat sortie generation will be conducted in approved explosives and fuels sited
  areas.
  14.9.7. Combat Sortie Generation Proficiency-Training Exercises. These exercises are
  mandatory training events to demonstrate the unit’s capability to generate a continuous
  sustained flow of combat sorties.
     14.9.7.1. Exercises will be conducted semi-annually (WG/CCs or equivalent in ARC or
     AETC will determine frequency) to ensure unit personnel proficiency.
     14.9.7.2. Duration will be at least 3 days (WG/CCs or equivalent in ARC or AETC will
     determine duration).
 250                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       14.9.7.3. The MXG and OG commanders will determine the number of aircraft
       scheduled to optimize aircrew and sortie generation training. War Mobilization Plan
       (WMP) -5 rates (or higher) should be used for planning combat sortie
       generation/regeneration.
       14.9.7.4. Perform after-fire inspections on all stations that fired IAW Dash-6 TO
       requirements. Tools, technical data and expendables will be available at each aircraft for
       all simulated firings. Applicable task times will be simulated (determined locally) by the
       BPO crew before moving to another aircraft or task. Half-up/half-down loading
       procedures will be performed to show recon-figuration of aircraft after actual and
       simulated inspections are complete. All inspections (actual or simulated) will be
       documented.
       14.9.7.5. Units will upload and download external fuel tanks during each exercise.
       14.9.7.6. Units will perform RWR and IFF Mode IV checks (as applicable).
       14.9.7.7. During wing combat sortie generation exercises, aircraft turnaround time is
       crucial to meet sortie generation requirements. Units will develop expertise and
       demonstrate the capability to perform combat sortie generation. The following
       procedures will apply:
          14.9.7.7.1. SCLs will be selected from known OPLAN requirements.
          14.9.7.7.2. Personnel participating in local exercises should be rotated so all
          personnel are exposed to combat sortie generation in the training environment.
       14.9.7.8. Conventional munitions operations will be exercised (e.g., breakout, buildup,
       delivery, loading, resupply).
       14.9.7.9. Load a complete SCL (or half up/half down to simulate a full SCL) on each
       exercise aircraft generated/scheduled to fly a simulated combat sortie.
       14.9.7.10. For each sortie flown, air-to-air missiles expended will be determined by shots
       taken, not to exceed the SCL configuration; all other external ordnance will be considered
       expended. Rockets will be expended at 50 percent. Ammunition in F-15 and F-16 aircraft
       will be loaded as required, 50 percent of all A-10 sorties will require reloading as a
       minimum (this may be simulated by hooking-up all required ammunition loading
       equipment and taking the standard time).
14.10. Crash Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR) Program.
   14.10.1. All host and tenant units with flying missions or active airfields/runways are
   required to maintain a CDDAR capability. The host unit is responsible for developing the
   CDDAR program, but execution of the program can be delegated to the tenant units as
   appropriate.
   14.10.2. CDDAR responsibilities are assigned to unit Maintenance Flight workcenters (N/A
   for ARC) Unit CDDAR programs include all elements of emergency/mishap response.
   Response to in-flight emergencies (IFE) must also be considered in developing base/unit
   programs.
       14.10.2.1. Minimum response to IFEs consists of assembling a tow team, pre-positioning
       it for immediate response, and it remaining in place until the IFE is terminated or until
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      251


     the aircraft is towed back to the parking apron if required. Depending on the nature of
     the emergency, other technicians may be required to stand-by to provide immediate
     response capability as the situation warrants.
  14.10.3. Lead Commands may regionalize CDDAR capability where it makes sense to do
  so. If CDDAR is regionalized, Lead Commands must supplement this instruction providing
  guidance for program execution consistent with this instruction. Where this capability has
  been regionalized, specific contingency plans must be developed considering mission needs
  and the following:
     14.10.3.1. Equipment availability
     14.10.3.2. Time sensitivity for re-opening airfields/runways
     14.10.3.3. Organizational capacity at the local level to provide limited removal capability
  14.10.4. All CDDAR programs must be designed to provide response capability to and/or
  recovery capability of disabled or crashed aircraft in an expeditious manner consistent with
  the following consideration(s):

         14.10.5.8.6. Ensure special qualifications for personnel are identified and
         documented. Identify individual team member qualifications for specific equipment
         operations (e.g., towing, jacking, support equipment, special purpose vehicle).
         14.10.5.8.7. Maintain a list of all CDDAR tools and equipment.
         14.10.5.8.8. Ensure tools and SE are adequate for recovery (i.e., bags, slings,
         manifolds, tow bars, dunnage/shoring, etc.) and are serviceable and available.
         14.10.5.8.9. Conduct/participate in annual training exercises. Coordinate with the
         Emergency Management Office before exercises.
         14.10.5.8.10. Coordinate with unit QA W&B manager when weight and center of
         gravity (CG) conditions are unknown.
  14.10.6. Recovery Team Qualifications:
      14.10.6.1. All team members must be qualified in basic CDDAR operations (except
      augmentees).
      14.10.6.2. All qualifications are recorded in CFETP, AF IMT 797, or MIS as applicable.
  14.10.7. Training Requirements:
      14.10.7.1. All recovery team members must receive initial training comprised of both
      academic and hands-on training/exercises and will include actual lifting of an aircraft.
      Personnel used to augment real-world recoveries do not require CDDAR specific
      training. This training will be developed and provided through an AETC formal training
      course. The ANG training course is available for use by all AF personnel.
         14.10.7.1.1. Personnel previously qualified and actively serving in a CDDAR
         capacity are exempt from attending the AETC CDDAR training course. Units are
         encouraged to schedule these personnel for this training as workload permits.
         14.10.7.1.2. Personnel previously qualified as CDDAR team members who are being
         returned/reassigned to these responsibilities must complete unit academic and hands
         on training (does not include actual lift) within 6 months (12 months for ARC) of
         being assigned.
         14.10.7.1.3. All newly assigned CDDAR team members must complete this
         requirement within 6 months (12 months for ARC) of being assigned CDDAR
         responsibilities.
         14.10.7.1.4. MXG/CC may waive the training requirement in emergency situations.
         However, if training is available, units must make every effort to schedule personnel
         consistent with this requirement. Team Chief and alternate Team Chief initial
         training, to include actual lifting of an aircraft, cannot be waived.
      14.10.7.2. All recovery team members must receive annual training comprised of both
      academic and hands-on training/exercises. Hands-on training includes aircraft lifting
      exercises using a unit owned aircraft or Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA).
      Do not use operational aircraft for actual aircraft lifts in a training environment. If units
      have no available training assets, consider participating with other organizations
      possessing training assets. If no assets are available suitable for these exercises, units
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       255


     demonstrate capability by completing all steps but stopping short of actually lifting an
     operational aircraft. Ensure all training is documented.
     14.10.7.3. CDDAR team chiefs must complete an actual aircraft lift every three years.
     This can be accomplished through real-world events, the AETC formal training course,
     ANG training course, or locally using a GITA .
     14.10.7.4. MXG/CC may waive training requirements as circumstances dictate. Waivers
     must not be used in lieu of training if training is available. Units must make every effort
     to schedule personnel consistent with this requirement.
  14.10.8. Vehicle/Equipment Requirements.
     14.10.8.1. The MXG/CC determines unit vehicle/equipment requirements, within the
     limits provided by AS(s). Units must identify vehicles and recovery SE in a local
     directive to ensure 24-hour availability.
     14.10.8.2. At a minimum, units possessing a full CDDAR capability must possess
     sufficient aircraft lifting equipment to accomplish a complete lift of the assigned MDS
     aircraft at that base. This can be achieved by any combination of lift bags, aircraft jacks,
     or aircraft slings. It is not necessary to maintain sufficient lift bags to lift an entire
     aircraft using only lift bags unless otherwise directed by aircraft technical order.
     14.10.8.3. Vehicle/SE requirements should include:
        14.10.8.3.1. Radio-equipped general purpose truck.
        14.10.8.3.2. Suitable trailer and tow vehicle (for storage and transportation of
        recovery equipment).
        14.10.8.3.3. All Terrain Forklift.
        14.10.8.3.4. Bulldozer.
        14.10.8.3.5. Aircraft tow vehicle.
        14.10.8.3.6. Crane (e.g., 20-ton, 50-ton, as applicable).
        14.10.8.3.7. 40 ft. flatbed semi trailer and tractor.
        14.10.8.3.8. Light carts.
        14.10.8.3.9. Tow bars.
        14.10.8.3.10. Air Bags.
        14.10.8.3.11. Slings, belly bands, snatch cables, chains, etc.
        14.10.8.3.12. Aircraft jacks.
        14.10.8.3.13. Dunnage/shoring.
     14.10.8.4. When base vehicle organizations are unable to support heavy equipment
     requirements, such as cranes and semi tractors and trailers, units will establish procedures
     to procure this support from local suppliers. Refer to AFI 24-301 and AFI 23-302 for
     lease procedures.
 256                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   14.10.9. Inspect for serviceability and inventory all recovery equipment to include air bags,
   manifolds, jacks, slings, shoring, etc., before and after each exercise and use. Periodic
   equipment inspections must be accomplished IAW intervals established in TOs or annually,
   if no TO intervals have been identified. Perform operational checks IAW applicable
   directives during exercises and/or inventory reviews. Document inspections and maintenance
   in MIS, on AFTO IMTs 244 or on MAJCOM approved form.
   14.10.10. Environmental, Safety, and Health Hazards. The key for developing a safe and
   effective CDDAR program is communication and coordination. The CDDAR OPR must
   ensure the BEE is consulted and directly involved in determining personnel health hazards,
   training required and appropriate levels of PPE.
       14.10.10.1. There are two distinct phases of an aircraft mishap--initial response and
       recovery.
           14.10.10.1.1. Initial response teams face the probability of an aircraft fire. As the
           composite material burns, gases, vapors and solid particles are released into the
           smoke plume.
           14.10.10.1.2. Recovery team members may be exposed to fibers and
           respirable/inhalable dusts as aircraft parts are moved, modified by cutting, breaking,
           twisting, or hammering. Personnel tasked to participate in crash or post-crash
           response, recovery, maintenance, and/or clean up operations must be aware of/briefed
           on all possible health issues involved. Units must ensure local policies and procedures
           for handling crash damaged composites are addressed to include training and PPE.
14.11. Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) Program. A dropped object is any aircraft part,
component, surface, or other item lost during aircrew operations (unless intentionally jettisoned)
from engine start to engine shutdown. Inadvertently released munitions are not considered
dropped objects and will be reported IAW AFI 91-204. (NOTE: Missing Chaff/Flare end-caps
are not reportable dropped objects).
   14.11.1. Responsibilities. All units, which fly, service, or maintain aircraft develop a DOP
   program with the following provisions:
       14.11.1.1. Lead Command DOP monitors or aircraft functional managers will act as
       OPR for all dropped object field inquiries IAW Lead Command established standards.
       The WG/CV serves as the DOP program manager. The WG/CV will appoint the wing
       DOP monitor. The wing DOP monitor may be assigned under QA.
       14.11.1.2. Training. The wing DOP monitor will identify and develop training standards.
       Commanders will ensure all maintenance personnel involved in on-equipment
       maintenance receive adequate DOP training.
       14.11.1.3. Prevention. Effective prevention of dropped objects starts when an aircraft
       door, panel, or cowling is opened for maintenance and during munitions build-up,
       loading, and arming. Maintenance personnel will ensure the serviceability of fasteners
       and the proper fit of doors, panels, connectors, etc. Place special attention on the correct
       length of fasteners and condition of nut plates and other securing devices. Supervisors
       place special emphasis on these areas during the inspection of completed maintenance
       actions.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         257


       14.11.1.4. Investigation. The DOP monitor will investigate each dropped object incident.
       Every effort will be made to determine the precise cause to ensure positive corrective
       action is accomplished. Anytime a materiel or design deficiency is the cause, or
       suspected cause, a DR will be submitted IAW TO 00-35D-54, even when an exhibit is
       not available. Investigation results will be distributed to each appropriate work center for
       inclusion in personnel training and education programs.
       14.11.1.5. Reporting. Units will follow DOP program reporting procedures below:
          14.11.1.5.1. Initial dropped object report will be made to the Lead Command via
          telephone, e-mail, or message within 24 hours of occurrence. If it involves casualties,
          property damage, or if adverse publicity is likely, report IAW AFMAN 10-206. The
          wing DOP monitor notifies the base/wing safety office of all dropped objects. Units
          will maintain reports for a minimum of 24 months (may be electronic).
          14.11.1.5.2. Follow-up final report will be made to the Lead Command within 3 duty
          days after the occurrence. The final format will be used as listed in attach 11.
          14.11.1.5.3. Transient Aircraft. The local wing/center DOP monitor will be
          responsible to investigate dropped objects from a transient aircraft. The wing/center
          DOP monitor will provide the home station DOP monitor with sufficient data to
          generate a report for trending and tracking purposes.

   proficiency.
       14.12.6.1. Inspectors who have not inspected a minimum of three FDTs in the last 45-
       day period will be considered “overdue inspectors” and shall not be permitted to inspect
       additional FDTs until successfully accomplishing the field test. The field test shall be
       administered as follows:
          14.12.6.1.1. The overdue inspector will perform the eddy current procedure on a
          FDT in the presence of a currently qualified inspector.
          14.12.6.1.2. The overdue inspector shall not have any false positives and shall not
          miss any discontinuities detected by the qualified inspector.
          14.12.6.1.3. The field-test may not be repeated.
          14.12.6.1.4. The field-test does not count toward the three engine per period
          inspection requirement for the overdue inspector.
       14.12.6.2. Inspectors shall be decertified and will require re-accomplishment of the POD
       test to become recertified under any of the following conditions:
          14.12.6.2.1. The field-test is not successfully completed within 15 days after the 45
          day period ends.
          14.12.6.2.2. The inspector fails the field-test.
          14.12.6.2.3. The inspector fails to inspect a minimum of three FDTs during each of
          the last two 45-day periods. EXAMPLE: individual fails to maintain proficiency in
          first 45-day period and successfully passes the field test. In the second consecutive
          45-day period, the individual does not maintain proficiency requirements. Individual
          will not be allowed to take a second field test and will be decertified.
   14.12.7. Documentation: Upon successful completion of training and certification the NDI
   section NCOIC will annotate the individual's ITP in TBA. Units will track proficiency
   requirements in the MIS. The NDI section NCOIC will maintain copies of inspection data
   sheets and field test results for one year.

   2A6X1, 2A3X3, 2A5X1X, 2A5X2, or AFETS/CETS. Certifying officials will be approved
   by the MXG/CC and tracked on the SCR. The number of certifying officials will be limited
   to the amount needed to meet certification requirements and mission demands. Certifying
   officials will maintain proficiency in the same manner as other technicians; certifying
   officials will recertify each other. Upon completion of formal training, individuals are task
   evaluated by the certifying official (an individual other than the instructor who administered
   the course), and placed on the SCR.
       14.17.4.1. Certified individuals who PCS to the same MDS and engine TMSM may by-
       pass the formal training course. These individuals must be re-certified by a certifier prior
       to being added to the SCR. Carry over the date of original class completion from previous
       documentation (certificate, training record, MIS printout). NOTE: If applicable, assigned
       AFETS/CETS should be used to certify other certifying officials.
   14.17.5. Documentation. After completing formal training, the instructor signs off the
   individual's ITP within TBA. Upon certification, personnel are placed and tracked on the
   SCR. Ensure that all borescope inspections are loaded against the engine and not the aircraft.
   14.17.6. MTF will ensure the following course codes are tracked in the MIS:
       14.17.6.1. Formal training borescope course.
       14.17.6.2. Proficiency requirement.

   14.17.7. Proficiency Requirements. As a minimum, fighter aircraft personnel bound by TO
   requirements for flexible borescope inspections must perform one flexible borescope
   inspection every 120 days to maintain proficiency. Work center supervisors ensure personnel
   who do not meet minimum requirements are decertified and must be recertified by
   completing annual recertification requirements.
       14.17.7.1. Lead Commands will determine proficiency requirements for non TO (i.e..
       event driven) inspections.
   14.17.8. Annual Recertification. Each borescope-qualified technician is required to be
   recertified by a certifying official. This is accomplished by having technicians demonstrate
   proper inspection requirements, as well as, use and care of equipment.
14.18. Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC). The objective of the FCC program is to enhance mission
effectiveness by providing qualified maintenance support for aircraft at locations other than

        deletions of the “C” prefix to an AFSC on the UMD.
     14.18.5.5. MAJCOM XPM           (A5M)      Command      Manpower    and    Organization
     Responsibilities: XPM will:
        14.18.5.5.1. Coordinate and obtain approval/disapproval from MAJCOM for
        Installation Manpower and Quality Office ACRs pertaining to validation of “C”
        prefix to AFSCs on the UMD.
        14.18.5.5.2. Assign the “C” prefix to AFSCs upon approval from MAJCOM FCC
        Program Manager. This provides MAJCOM functional manager and unit senior
        maintenance manager’s visibility of squadron FCC SDAP positions. NOTE: FCC
        SDAP positions do not effect a unit’s manpower authorizations.
     14.18.5.6. Squadron commanders:
        14.18.5.6.1. Control their squadron FCC program IAW AFI 36-3017, AFMAN 36-
        2108 and this instruction.
        14.18.5.6.2. Ensure FCCs fly only when needed for the mission.
        14.18.5.6.3. Appoint and remove FCCs IAW AFMAN 36-2101. Assign FCCs for a
        minimum of one year, unless removed for cause. If removed, they may not be
        reassigned for a period of one year.
        14.18.5.6.4. Ensure only qualified FCCs and assistant FCCs who meet minimum
        requirements in AFI 36-3017 receive SDAP. In addition, FCCs must fly a minimum
        of three qualifying missions per quarter. An indicator of having too many FCCs may
        be reflected in a unit whose FCCs routinely do not meet minimum quarterly
        requirements.
        14.18.5.6.5. Normally, assign no more than two FCCs per aircraft (an FCC and
        assistant FCC) to each qualifying mission unless approved by MAJCOM.
        EXCEPTION: SQ/CC may assign the minimum number of additional FCCs when
        required to maintain proper work-rest cycles or meet TO requirements.
        14.18.5.6.6. Appoint a unit program manager.

      "C" prefix by initiating an AF IMT 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action,
      or special order.
      14.18.5.7.5. Counsel FCCs and assistant FCCs on SDAP termination. (AFI 36-3017,
      Table 3 lists reasons for termination.) SDAP stops on the dates listed in this table. As
      long as a “C” prefix is attached to an AFSC the member shall receive SDAP.
      14.18.5.7.6. Review, update, and authenticate the monthly SDAP roster. NOTE: If
      changes are made on the monthly SDAP roster, an AF IMT 2096 or special order

        plan based on maintenance and mission requirements. The AC will be the primary
        decision authority to determine when the FCC begins a rest cycle for the next
        mission.
        14.18.5.11.2. Upon arrival at en route/transient locations, determine the FCC's ability
        to safely and effectively perform his/her duties. In making this determination,
        consider the duration of the flight, the ability of the FCC’s to rest during the flight,
276                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


         and the quality of the rest the FCC’s experienced during the flight. The FCC’s
         primary job is preparing the aircraft (e.g., inspect, service, aircraft forms
         maintenance) for the next mission. FCCs do not automatically enter crew rest with the
         aircrew upon arrival at an en route/transient location unless the duty day was
         exceeded.
         14.18.5.11.3. If the FCC's safety is jeopardized by fatigue, the FCC's duty day must
         end.
         14.18.5.11.4. Ensure crew integrity for quarters is maintained and inform the FCC of
         billeting location. Any official business required by the FCC interrupts the FCCs rest
         period. This includes official business conducted on the telephone. Any
         Interruptions must be made only under the most exceptional circumstances.
         14.18.5.11.5. Provide feedback on the FCC using AFI 21-101 Attachment 3 and
         return it to the squadron FCC Program Manager upon return to home station.

(military, civilian, and contractors) working in, on, around, or traveling through areas near
 278                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


aircraft, munitions, AGE, engines, or components thereof will comply with FOD prevention.
This section establishes minimum requirements for a FOD prevention program.
14.19. (NASIC)Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention Program. NASIC activities that
work in, on, around, or travel through areas near aircraft or aerospace ground equipment will
comply with FOD prevention as outlined in AFI21-101. As applicable, NASIC/GXF must ensure
newly assigned personnel receive FOD Prevention Orientation/Familiarization during in
processing. As a tenant unit, NASIC/GXF will develop unit specific FOD procedures but will
participate in and comply with the Wright-Patterson AFB program requirements.
   14.19.1. Definition. FOD: Any damage to an aircraft, engine, aircraft system, component,
   tire, munitions, or SE caused by a foreign object(s) (FO) which may or may not degrade the
   required safety and/ or operational characteristics of the aforementioned items.
   14.19.2. FOD Prevention.
       14.19.2.1. On aircraft, uninstalled engines, LRUs and AGE: Openings, ports, lines,
       hoses, electrical connections, and ducts will be properly plugged or capped to prevent FO
       from entering the systems. Items that are actively being disconnected, installed, and/or
       removed will be capped IAW Tech Data or at completion of the task. At no time will
       items, (e.g., aircraft forms binders, VTR tapes, checklists, tools.), be placed in or on
       engine intakes. NOTE: Does not apply to technicians performing inlet maintenance,
       inspections and blade blending requiring lights, files, or other tools inside aircraft inlets.
       Inventory all items IAW paragraph 10.4.2.1 of this instruction.
       14.19.2.2. Install intake plugs, or tape and barrier paper (as required by technical data)
       prior to performing maintenance in or around engine intakes. Ensure engine inlet run-up
       screens and anti-personnel guards are used IAW applicable weapon system TOs.
       14.19.2.3. Covers (e.g., engine, pitot tube(s) to include ejection seat) will remain
       installed on aircraft as close to crew show as possible to prevent FOD, based on MDS
       and local MXG/CC guidance.
       14.19.2.4. Use a light source of sufficient illumination to inspect the aircraft intakes and
       exhaust for FO/FOD. A pocketless, zipperless, buttonless bunny-suit, cloth over-boots or
       stocking feet, boots removed, for intakes only, will be worn whenever physical entry into
       an aircraft intake or exhaust is required. Suits are not required to be worn if personnel do
       not physically enter these areas. (A rubber mat may be used instead of cloth over-booties,
       or boots removed if MDS tech data directs.) When performing intake inspections while
       wearing a chemical ensemble (CWE), ensure all pockets are emptied and accessories
       removed. CWE will be worn during “real world” situations only to minimize the potential
       for FOD and intake damage. During Operational Readiness Inspections (ORIs) or
       Operational Readiness Exercises, the CWE will be removed and the bunny-suit will be
       utilized. NOTE: If CWE metal zippers are exposed, cover them with any type of tape and
       account for the tape upon completion of the inspection.
       14.19.2.5. Restricted area badges will be removed when performing intake/inlet/exhaust
       inspections if personnel physically enter these areas. Restricted area badges will be
       secured with a subdued nylon/cotton cord or plastic armband.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        279


     14.19.2.6. Each base will develop a local flightline clothing policy aimed at FOD
     prevention. Specific attention will be given to the wearing of hats on the flightline and the
     wearing of badges and passes. Climate and safety will be considered.
        14.19.2.6.1. Metal insignias/badges will not be worn on the flightline.
        14.19.2.6.2. Wigs, hairpieces, metal hair fasteners, earrings, or any other jewelry that
        may fall off without notice, are not authorized on the flightline.
        14.19.2.6.3. Escorts of visiting personnel will ensure FOD prevention measures are
        taken.
     14.19.2.7. Discard readily removable (slide or pressure fit) pocket clips from tools (e.g.,
     flashlights, continuity testers, small screwdrivers) prior to placement in tool kits. Do not
     disassemble/ damage tools for sole purpose of removing clips, rubber switch guards, etc.
     14.19.2.8. All maintenance production areas must have FO containers readily accessible
     to workers. All vehicles normally driven on the flightline must be equipped with secured
     and lidded FO containers.
     14.19.2.9. Control all work order residue used on or around aircraft, uninstalled engines,
     and AGE.
     14.19.2.10. Rags will be controlled and accounted for IAW Chapter 10 of this
     instruction. Rag control applies to all organizations and personnel performing aircraft,
     missile, munitions, and equipment maintenance.
     14.19.2.11. FOD walks are mandatory to remove FO from ramps, runways, maintenance
     areas and access roads; in addition vacuum/magnetic sweepers or sweeping by hand are
     highly encouraged to supplement FOD walks.
     14.19.2.12. When FOD is discovered on a transient aircraft, depot input/output, ERRC,
     or CRF engine, the host FOD monitor or aircrew must notify the owning organization
     within 24 hours. An informational copy of the FOD report must be provided to the
     owning organization’s safety office/FOD monitor to ensure compliance with AFI 91-204.
     Aircrews must ensure proper documentation in the AFTO Form/IMT 781A or electronic
     equivalent, has been completed.
        14.19.2.12.1. For depot input/output, ERRC, or CRF engine: If the FOD is found
        during the receiving inspection at one of the aforementioned locations, it will be
        tracked/charged (if necessary) to the owning MAJCOM unit. If discovered any other
        time at one of the aforementioned locations, it will be tracked/charged to the ALC,
        ERRC or CRF.
     14.19.2.13. Pilots and aircrew members must account for all equipment and personal
     items after each flight and ensure any items that become lost during flight are
     documented in the aircraft AFTO Form/IMT 781A. When an item is lost on or in the
     vicinity of aircraft or equipment, lost item/tool procedures in Chapter 10 of this
     instruction will be followed.
     14.19.2.14. Ensure local FOD prevention programs address the elimination of FOs in
     aircraft cockpits and flight decks prior to flight.
280                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      14.19.2.15. Use extreme care during engine ground runs. Jet blast and helicopter hover
      power check areas must be free of debris that could cause FOD.
      14.19.2.16. Special emphasis is required for items such as: remove before flight streamer
      attachment, safing pin condition, hinge pin security, dust and FO prevention cover
      condition/security, and aircraft forms binder condition. Periodically check these types of
      items for FO prevention compliance. Units will account for Dash-21 equipment and
      covers IAW AFI 21-103. Weapons expediters must ensure all mission specific safing
      gear is controlled and accounted for to preclude loss and potential FOD.
      14.19.2.17. Vehicle operators will stop and perform a visual FOD inspection on all
      equipment and tires prior to entering the flightline areas. Wing CVs are the waiver
      authority for this requirement.
      14.19.2.18. Grounding wires/points:
         14.19.2.18.1. Two allen head screws, or equivalent, will be utilized to secure cable to
         grounding clip. Coat screws heads with sealant or stake the screws in order to prevent
         them screws from backing out. Unused screws will be removed.
         14.19.2.18.2. All grounding points will be kept clean of debris at all times and should
         be a high interest item for FOD walks.
      14.19.2.19. Use of magnetic bars on the flightline is optional. If used, the magnetic bars
      will be towed by, or attached to vehicles primarily used on the flightline. Magnetic bars
      will be inspected and made FOD free prior to the beginning of each shift. Ensure
      magnetic bar installations are approved IAW AFI 23-302.
      14.19.2.20. A locally manufactured tool for removing debris from tire treads is
      authorized for use and will be identified to the vehicle by using the vehicle ID number.
      14.19.2.21. Remove metal identification bands from all tubing, (except aircraft installed
      egress system components) and cables on the aircraft. Additionally remove metal
      identification bands from cargo tie-down chains/devices prior to use around aircraft.
      However, factory installed ID tags attached to cargo chains/devices will remain on the
      chain/device to identify the type being used. Do not remove manufacturer installed metal
      identification bands from hydraulic hoses. Hydraulic lines will be marked IAW TO
      42E1-1-1, Aerospace Hose Assembly.
      14.19.2.22. Use X-ray, borescope, and other equipment to locate FO in inaccessible
      areas.
  14.19.3. FOD Prevention Responsibilities.
      14.19.3.1. The WG/CV or Center CV will be assigned as the FOD Prevention Program
      Manager and appoint a qualified TSgt (or above), or civilian equivalent, or contractor if
      designated by PWS, with at least 8 years (1 year for ALC) experience in the maintenance
      field to the position of FOD monitor and their name will be posted in a prominent place
      within the unit on a locally developed visual aid.
      14.19.3.2. The WG/CV or Center CV will:
         14.19.3.2.1. Ensure all personnel actively support the FOD Prevention Program.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                   281


         14.19.3.2.2. Provide local guidance to ensure each FOD mishap is investigated and
         action taken to solve any underlying problems.
         14.19.3.2.3. Review all unit FOD mishap reports and analyze the reports and other
         data for trends identifying areas requiring management action.
         14.19.3.2.4. Coordinate FOD prevention needs with the airfield manager and other
         agencies when construction is in progress on or near the flightline, or other areas
         where FOD incidents could occur.
         14.19.3.2.5. Ensure FOD prevention is part of QA inspections.
         14.19.3.2.6. Coordinate with airfield manager to identify and properly mark FOD
         check points IAW Lead Command standards.
  14.19.4. FOD Monitor: The location of the FOD Monitor will be within QA at the discretion
  of the WG/Center CVs. The minimum responsibilities of the wing FOD monitor are:
  14.19.4. (NASIC) FOD Monitor. IAW WPAFB Instruction 21-101, NASIC/GXF will
  appoint a FOD monitor in writing and provide a copy to the 88ABW FOD monitor.
     14.19.4.1. Inform all wing/center agencies of FOD hazards.
     14.19.4.2. Develop wing/center procedures to document and perform spot checks of
     selected areas weekly.
     14.19.4.3. Be involved in each FOD investigation and help ensure corrective actions are
     sound.
     14.19.4.4. Monitor and recommend changes to FOD prevention training. Those units
     having several types of aircraft assigned will have their FOD prevention training
     incorporated into one wing/center training program. Additionally, ensure an initial FOD
     awareness and responsibilities briefing is given to all newly assigned personnel.
     14.19.4.5. Periodically inspect and report damaged pavement, flightline construction, or
     other hazards in or near aircraft parking ramps or taxiways to the airfield manager and
     monitor status to ensure timely repairs.
  14.19.5. FOD Investigation and Reporting.
     14.19.5.1. When suspected or confirmed FOD is discovered, the MOC/Maintenance
     Control Function will be immediately notified. The MOC/Maintenance Control Function
     will notify QA/Center FOD/DOP Monitor. All aircraft sustaining FOD damage from an
     unknown cause will be considered for impoundment. If internal engine FOD is
     confirmed, the engine will be impounded IAW Chapter 9 of this instruction.
         14.19.5.1.1. Units must make every attempt to determine root cause of FOD related
         mishaps before returning engines and modules to the depot for investigation. If
         engines/modules are returned to the depot, an information DR will be completed and
         forwarded. All FOD mishap engines and modules returned to depot must be properly
         marked on the outside of the packaging as a FOD mishap asset. Mark container or
         package in RED with the following statement, “FOD Mishap investigation required”.
282                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      14.19.5.2. FOD incidents are classified as preventable and non-preventable. Only
      preventable FOD over $50K (parts and labor) will be chargeable to the FOD rate. FODs
      are considered preventable except those listed below:
         14.19.5.2.1. Caused by natural environment or wildlife. This includes hail, ice,
         animals, insects, sand, and birds. Report this type of damage IAW AFI 91-204. Do
         not include these in the FOD rates.
         14.19.5.2.2. From internal engine materiel failure, as long as damage is confined to
         the engine.
         14.19.5.2.3. Caused by materiel failure of an aircraft component if the component
         failure is reported as a DR using the combined mishap DR reporting procedures of
         AFI 91-204 and TO 00-35D-54.
         14.19.5.2.4. Found during depot overhaul for maximum operating time.
      14.19.5.3. Additionally, the following apply:
         14.19.5.3.1. Engine damage caused by improper anti-ice/de-ice procedures by either
         flight or ground crews are considered preventable.
         14.19.5.3.2. Engine or airframe damage caused by gunnery or rocket mission
         ricochets is considered non-preventable provided mission parameters were not
         exceeded and range cleaning was sufficient.
         14.19.5.3.3. Helicopter/CV-22 engine damage caused by rocks, stones, wood, or
         other objects ingested during low hover operations are considered non-preventable,
         provided mission parameters were not exceeded.
         14.19.5.3.4. FOD incidences leading to blade blending are reported IAW the blade
         blending section in this chapter.
      14.19.5.4. Preventable FOD over $50K incurred at test cell or on trim pad will be
      chargeable.
      14.19.5.5. Appropriate Lead Command offices will assist in resolving any questionable
      FOD issues, (i.e., preventable or non-preventable.)
      14.19.5.6. Wing/Center FOD monitor will provide an initial report of all FOD incidents
      to Lead Command FOD monitor by telephone, fax or e-mail as soon as the damage is
      known, but NLT 24 hours after occurrence. A follow up report will be required every 45
      days until closeout. Use the FOD report format as listed in Attachment 12.
         14.19.5.6.1. Lead Command will determine command-reporting procedures.
      14.19.5.7. FOD rates are computed by MDS as follows: Number of Preventable FODs
      (damage exceeding $50K) ÷ Aircraft flying hours X 10,000 = FOD rate. (ALCs will
      compute FOD rates by (damage exceeding $50K)÷aircraft flying hours X 1,000 = FOD
      rate. ALCs will compute aircraft flying hours using acceptance flights, functional check
      flights, ground runs, and the number of un-installed engine test cell starts.)
  14.19.6. FOD Prevention Committee Meeting. The WG/Center CV is the committee
  chairperson. The MXG/MXW CC will chair the meeting in the absence of the WG/Center
  CV. Minimum attendee representation is all group commanders, director(s), commanders of
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        283


   units with maintenance personnel, safety (Center and Base), CE, Airfield Manager, and
   security forces. The chairperson designates additional attendees (e.g., agencies, detachments)
   as required. The host base FOD prevention committee chairperson will incorporate tenant
   units in the host unit program. Tenant units should establish their own unit FOD committee,
   but will still participate in the host program and comply with host program requirements.
   Meetings will be conducted monthly when the unit exceeds the Lead Command-established
   standard, and quarterly if the unit FOD rate is less than the established standard. The meeting
   will identify negative trends and develop action plans to resolve them. The meeting should
   also be used to recognize personnel making significant contributions to FOD prevention (e.g.
   golden bolt program, FOD poster contests, or other FOD recognition programs locally
   developed at each unit).
      14.19.6.1. Suggested agenda items include:
          14.19.6.1.1. Total number of airframe, engine, and tire FOD incidents during the
          reporting period. Indicate quantity and cause. Current status of all other pending
          incidents will be discussed.
          14.19.6.1.2. Mechanical/vacuum sweeper status.
          14.19.6.1.3. Review and refinement of the existing FOD prevention program.
          14.19.6.1.4. New directives/actions established to minimize FOD.
          14.19.6.1.5. Status and condition of engine run-up screens as applicable.
          14.19.6.1.6. Results of X-rays for FOs during engine bay inspections, acceptance
          inspections, and phase inspections. Maintenance trends should be discussed when an
          increase in FO is discovered during these X-rays.
          14.19.6.1.7. Identification of potential FOD sources.
          14.19.6.1.8. Lost tools/items.
          14.19.6.1.9. Increased potential for FOD within the next 30-60 days.
          14.19.6.1.10. Dropped objects. Pay particular attention to those that result in
          downstream FOD.
          14.19.6.1.11. Breakdown of FOD inspections/assessments.
          14.19.6.1.12. Cockpit FO incidents.
          14.19.6.1.13. Commanders comments.
   14.19.7. Bird Strikes. Consult Technical Order 1-1-691 Cleaning And Corrosion Prevention
   And Control, Aerospace And Non-Aerospace Equipment for bird strike clean up procedures
   and AFMAN 91-223 Avian Safety Investigations And Reports for bird strike reporting
   procedures.
14.20. Forms Documentation.
   14.20.1. Document Repeat/Recur and CND discrepancies IAW TO 00-20-1.
   14.20.2. Document IPIs IAW TO 00-20-1.
 284                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       14.20.2.1. An IPI is an additional inspection or verification step at a critical point in the
       installation, assembly, or reassembly of a system, subsystem or component. These
       inspections are either TO, MAJCOM, or locally directed and are accomplished by
       qualified personnel as identified on the SCR. The weapon system lead command as
       defined in AFPD 10-9 will determine minimum IPI requirements and incorporate these
       requirements into applicable TOs.”
       14.20.2.2. Operations Officer/MX SUPT compiles a list of squadron tasks requiring IPIs.
       The list must include WUC, task title/description, specific TO, paragraph, and step
       number within the TO task where the IPI will be called for. NOTE: Some digital TOs
       do not list paragraph and step numbers. In this case, list the description of the step just
       prior to and after the IPI. When developing the IPI list, consult with QA on trends or
       problem areas that continually warrant extra supervisory attention. Squadrons submit
       their on- and off-equipment lists to QA for consolidation, MXG/CC approval, and
       publication as the group IPI listing. IPIs must be reviewed every 2 years for
       applicability. There is no requirement to include TO-directed IPI tasks in the local
       listing.”
       14.20.2.3. The IPI list for weapon systems using digital TOs where the paragraph and/or
       step number are not displayed will include a locally assigned IPI number for AFTO Form
       781A referencing, WUC, nomenclature, specific TO, paragraph number (if displayed),
       step number (if displayed), IPI task description, and description of the step just prior to
       and after the IPI. If the TO system has a digitally displayed IPI feature the IPI will be
       displayed when the IPI is required and will include the locally assigned IPI number and a
       description of the IPI task.
14.21. Ground Instructional Trainer Aircraft (GITA).
   14.21.1. Permanently assigned GITA aircraft are those aircraft that are not maintained in
   airworthy condition. Active GITA are maintained in system/subsystem operational condition
   for purposes of maintenance training and normally carried in possession codes as outlined in
   AFI 21-103 or AFI 16-402. Inactive GITA are aircraft permanently grounded for use in
   personnel training. This section does not apply to ABDR training aircraft. ABDR training
   aircraft are managed by HQ AFMC/A4RE-PO. This chapter does not apply to training
   equipment maintained by CLS contracts administered by commands other than AETC.
       14.21.1.1. Temporarily Grounded (active). Temporarily grounded aircraft are subject to
       recall to the active fleet.
          14.21.1.1.1. Only those items requested by the ALC Program Manager will be
          considered for removal. If the item does not affect training and if approved by
          MXG/CC, the part will be removed and turned in as per ALC Program Manager
          instructions.
          14.21.1.1.2. Units are responsible for storing uninstalled or removed equipment that
          is not required for training.
       14.21.1.2. Permanently Grounded GITAs (inactive). Permanently grounded aircraft are
       those declared excess to future operations or flying requirements by HQ USAF. Aircraft
       in this category will be re-designated by the addition of the prefix “G” to the basic MDS.
       Training Aid Aircraft (TAA) are also Permanently Grounded (inactive). Aircraft in this
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     285


     category, at a minimum, require an aircraft fuselage that was previously in the AF
     inventory as an aircraft. TAAs will be re-designated by the addition of the prefix “T” to
     the basic. Assigned aircraft are not maintained in airworthy condition, and only the
     system/subsystem required for the specific training requirements will be maintained in
     operational condition for purposes of required maintenance training. Permanently
     grounded missiles retain their original MDS without a prefix. NOTE: In accordance with
     AFI 16-402, aircraft used for training are not terminated from the AF inventory. Any
     questions about the designation of an aircraft used for training should be directed to the
     Lead Command AVDO.
        14.21.1.2.1. Upon assignment of a permanently grounded GITA/TAA, the Program
        Manager will initiate a preliminary "save list," identifying items to be removed and
        turned in to LRS.
        14.21.1.2.2. If an item on the save list is not removed, annotate the reason for not
        removing it and coordinate with the applicable Program Manager and group
        commander. If items on the save list are required for training and an unserviceable
        item will suffice, units should inform the Program Manager. Identify all
        unserviceable components furnished by ALC in a conspicuous manner (Red X or Red
        dot system).
  14.21.2. MXG/CC Responsibilities:
     14.21.2.1. Develop an Installation Publication or supplement to define the scope of
     training functions for GITA/TAA use; functional responsibility for funding, operations,
     maintenance, and records management.
     14.21.2.2. Maintenance of GITA/TAA used in support of training. Units that do not have
     organic maintenance capability will establish a Support Agreement (SA) or MOA
     assigning maintenance responsibility. GITA maintenance includes on- and off-equipment
     maintenance of active systems and subsystems and necessary actions to maintain the
     aircraft in a safe and presentable condition. TAA require minimal maintenance on
     systems/subsystems used for training requirements and necessary actions to maintain the
     aircraft in a safe and presentable condition.
        14.21.2.2.1. Determine which system and subsystem are required to support the
        training. Consider present, future, and cross-utilization of systems when making
        determinations. These systems will be maintained in the same configuration as
        operational equipment.
        14.21.2.2.2. Ensure explosive components are removed that are not required to
        support training requirements.
        14.21.2.2.3. Place retained systems and subsystems not currently being used for
        training into extended storage IAW technical data.
        14.21.2.2.4. Ensure standard maintenance practices regarding inspection appearance;
        cleanliness, ground safety, and prevention of corrosion are met. Corrosion control
        procedures are outlined in TO 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons System-Cleaning and
        Corrosion Control.
286                                        AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      14.21.2.2.5. Develop and prepare inspection technical data check lists for use in
      inspecting the condition and safety of equipment before use and ensure inspections
      are performed. Prior-to-use inspections are conducted by the using organization
      employing a tailored weapon system pre-/post-dock checklist. Conduct periodic
      maintenance inspections using a tailored work deck.
      14.21.2.2.6. Prepare a separate memorandum for each GITA/TAA, addressed to the
      appropriate ALC Program Manager for the aircraft and inform them of the systems
      and subsystems that will be maintained in operational configuration. When changes in
      requirements occur, initiate a new memorandum. Provide copies of all GITA/TAA
      memorandums to the Lead Command AVDO.
      14.21.2.2.7. Ensure air and space vehicle inventory reporting IAW AFI 21-103 as
      required for ground trainers. Aircraft used for ground trainers are exempt from status
      and utilization reporting.
      14.21.2.2.8. Ensure maintenance actions are documented IAW 00-20 series TOs.
      Lead Commands determine use of MIS for permanently grounded GITA records
      management. Owning units not having maintenance capability will establish SAs or
      MOAs.
      14.21.2.2.9. Ensure timely completion of TCTOs on systems designated for
      configuration management and proper configuration status accounting is maintained.
      Accomplish TCTOs on systems not designated for configuration management as
      required to ensure safety of operation or as directed by Program Manager. TCTOs
      will not be maintained on TAA.
      14.21.2.2.10. Ensure proper coordination and documentation of parts removed from
      training aircraft are accomplished as follows:
         14.21.2.2.10.1. When an item is removed or replaced, supervisors ensure this
         action is documented in the aircraft forms. Include the authority for removal (e.g.,
         message number, telecon, letters, and dates) and condition of
         installed/replacement items.
         14.21.2.2.10.2. When the limited save list actions have been done, forward a
         copy of the completed list to the documentation function. This copy becomes part
         of the historical records. Also forward a second copy to the appropriate ALC
         Program Manager.
         14.21.2.2.10.3. Ensure W&B handbook requirements are complied with IAW TO
         1-1B-50 and applicable -5 series TOs.
         14.21.2.2.10.4. Ensure operating and maintenance technical data are readily
         accessible whenever the GITA/TAA is in use or undergoing inspection.
         14.21.2.2.10.5. Identify an individual to oversee GITA/TAA as an additional
         duty. Individual must possess the technical expertise, management skills, and
         leadership ability to assure quality maintenance standards of equipment condition,
         reliability, and safety are attained. Individual is responsible to accomplish and/or
         coordinate maintenance actions for the GITA/TAA, ensure GITA/TAA
         documentation is accurate and complete, and must be qualified to operate
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       287


              GITA/TAA systems and appropriate support equipment to conduct GITA/TAA
              maintenance.
      14.21.2.3. For equipment designated as trainers, only the systems required for technical
      training (or those required to ensure safety or system integrity) need to be maintained.
      (This does not apply to "temporarily" grounded aircraft or operational equipment or
      systems on loan from Lead Commands or ALCs.)
   14.21.3. Technical Data Applicability:
      14.21.3.1. Operational systems on GITA/TAA will be maintained IAW applicable
      technical data. The specific policy governing the use and modification of technical data is
      contained in TO 00-5-1. Some systems may be operated and maintained with original
      contractor data because formal technical data was never developed and/or the contractor
      data was never assigned a TO number.
      14.21.3.2. Inspection and lubrication requirements may be adjusted to correspond with
      training requirements and equipment usage and to prevent over or under inspection.
      Additionally, where significant savings may be achieved, the commander or contract
      project manager (in coordination with the functional commander or director) may
      authorize deviations or changes to technical data requirements, including substitution of
      materials. In all cases, safety or design function must not be compromised. Maintain
      documentation authorizing deviations.
      14.21.3.3. TCTOs. The QA function or other designated agency is responsible for
      determining applicability of TCTOs for GITAs. TCTO upgrades are not required on
      TAA.
14.22. Hangar Queen Aircraft.
   14.22.1. General. The objective of this program is to ensure the entire fleet remains healthy
   and all possible management actions are carried out to ensure aircraft do not remain
   inoperative for extended periods. Lead Commands will establish a Hangar Queen program.
   14.22.2. Definitions:
      14.22.2.1. A Hangar Queen is a unit-possessed aircraft that has not flown for at least 30
      calendar days. Aircraft are exempt from accruing Hangar Queen time for up to ten days
      immediately following DFT/CFT repair or maintenance; however, if an aircraft is not
      flown after the tenth day, the ten days are included in the total number of days since last
      fly date to determine the Hangar Queen category computation. All aircraft placed on
      higher HQ alert status are exempt from Hangar Queen management and reporting.
      Additionally, aircraft with low observable (LO) technology (e.g., B-2, F-22) placed on or
      postured for higher HQ/local alert status taskings are exempt from Hangar Queen
      reporting throughout the duration of alert status/posturing. An aircraft is released from
      Hangar Queen status after the first flight. A few examples are provided to clarify when an
      aircraft becomes a Hangar Queen.
          14.22.2.1.1. A unit-possessed aircraft has not flown for 20 calendar days, enters
          depot status for 5 more calendar days, and then returns to unit possession on the 26th
          non-fly day; the unit has up to 10 calendar days to fly the aircraft to avoid Hangar

          Queen status. If this aircraft does not fly on the 10th calendar day (35th non-fly day),
          the aircraft would become 36-day Category 1 Hangar Queen on the next day.
          14.22.2.1.2. A unit-possessed aircraft has not flown for 2 calendar days, then enters
          depot status for 1 calendar day and is returned to unit possession, the unit must fly the
          aircraft in the next 27 calendar days to avoid becoming Category 1.
       14.22.2.2. Hangar Queen aircraft are further defined by three categories:
          14.22.2.2.1. Category 1 -- Aircraft that have not flown for 30 to 59 calendar days.
          14.22.2.2.2. Category 2 -- Aircraft that have not flown for 60 to 89 calendar days.
          14.22.2.2.3. Category 3 -- Aircraft that have not flown for 90 or more calendar days.
   14.22.3. When an aircraft becomes identified as a Hangar Queen, management must
   intensify their efforts to alleviate the condition as soon as possible (e.g., mission impact
   letters, Lead Command and item manager assistance). Aircraft last fly day shall be accessible
   through the AF Portal Fleet Asset Status Gadget.
       14.22.3.1. When an aircraft becomes a Category 1 Hangar Queen, establish a
       maintenance recovery plan that minimizes the time needed to get the aircraft airborne.
       Assign a Hangar Queen manager to implement the plan. Forming a temporary dedicated
       recovery team is also an option. Ensure strict management, control, and documentation of
       all CANNs, transfer, and diversion actions from the Hangar Queen aircraft. Brief aircraft
       maintenance and supply status to the SQ/CC daily and weekly to the MXG/CC and
       WG/CC. Category 1 aircraft are managed locally.
       14.22.3.2. When an aircraft becomes a Category 2 Hangar Queen, assign a SNCO or
       officer (or civilian equivalent) to manage the Hangar Queen. The MXG/CC or designated
       representative must approve any further CANNs, transfer, and diversion actions from the
       Hangar Queen aircraft. Brief aircraft maintenance and supply status at the daily wing
       standup meeting. Units will report aircraft tail number(s) monthly to the Lead Command
       with the estimated delivery dates for top down-time driver (AWP) parts.
       14.22.3.3. When an aircraft becomes a Category 3 Hangar Queen, aircraft maintenance
       and supply status will be briefed at the daily wing standup meeting. Units will report
       aircraft tail number(s) monthly to the Lead Command with the estimated delivery dates
       for top down-time driver (AWP) parts.
   14.22.4. Ensure applicable Dash-6 and 00-20 series TO requirements and TCTOs are
   accomplished.
   14.22.5. Inform the MOC of any change in aircraft status.
   14.22.6. MXG/CC will determine the need for an FCF/OCF (if not otherwise required by the
   aircraft specific TO).
   14.22.7. QA will perform a final review of all aircraft forms initiated since the last flight
   prior to the first flight.
14.23. Hot Refueling Procedures.
   14.23.1. Hot refueling is the transfer of fuel into an aircraft having one or more engines
   running. The purpose of hot refueling is to reduce aircraft ground time, personnel and

AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        293


   available and manage the non-tactical radio program. Personnel will receive initial radio
   operating training before assuming duties involving radio operation AFI 33-106, AFMAN
   33-120, AFI 33-118, and AFI 33-202V1. For effective flightline operation, more non-tactical
   radio nets are authorized when large numbers or different types of weapon systems are
   assigned or when SAs so specify. The following general guidelines apply:
   14.24.2. Allowance for specific radios are shown in AS 660, Equipment Allowances for
   Non-Weapon Systems Communications Requirements, Repair Cycle Data Listing. Process
   requests for specific radio equipment to support maintenance activities IAW AFMAN 23-
   110, and AFI 33-106, AFMAN 33-120, AFI 33-118, and AFI 33-202. The Air Force
   Equipment      Management       System    (AFEMS)      web     site     is located at:
   https://www.afems.wpafb.af.mil/afems40/splash.html.
   14.24.3. A VHF/UHF radio is authorized to provide communications between aircraft and
   maintenance. Aircrews may relay advance status information. Coordinate procedures for use
   of these radio communications with operations.
14.25. Lead Technician.
   14.25.1. Lead Technician (Lead Tech) Responsibilities. Units may choose to identify Lead
   Techs. A Lead Tech is the flight AFSC SME and represents all personnel in that AFSC.
   Their use is especially important where multiple AFSCs are integrated into sections. Units
   supporting different aircraft types may find it beneficial to identify Lead Techs for each
   MDS. Serving as a Lead Tech is considered an additional duty, not a duty title or full-time
   job. Lead Techs will:
      14.25.1.1. Work with the flight chief/section NCOICs to ensure personnel in the Lead
      Tech's AFSC receive proficiency training.
      14.25.1.2. Serve as the flight chief’s technical advisor for matters relating to their AFSC.
      14.25.1.3. Work with the flight chief/section NCOIC to ensure special tools and
      equipment utilized by personnel in their AFSC are serviceable and meet mission
      requirements.
      14.25.1.4. Monitor repair processes to ensure safe, effective repair of unit assets.
      14.25.1.5. Evaluate trends and indicators of troubleshooting effectiveness and 2LM
      efficiency. Unit "Re-test OK" components (RTOK) are costly and often indicate
      opportunities to improve troubleshooting or repair processes. If available, RTOK data
      will be reviewed monthly for trends. Simple process improvements may result from
      emphasis on RTOK costs, more in-depth troubleshooting, or (circumstances permitting)
      reinstalling original LRUs when replacement LRUs drawn from supply do not fix the
      problem
14.26. MRT Procedures.
   14.26.1. The MXG/CC is responsible for deploying MRTs and equipment to recover aircraft
   at remote locations, as directed by this instruction and applicable Lead Command procedures
   (see Attachment 7 - Attachment 9 for MRT chief checksheet). Unit resources, including
   personnel, supplies, and equipment, will be made available to support en route aircraft
   recoveries. The MXG/CC will:
 294                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


       14.26.1.1. Ensure adequate equipment resources, as authorized by applicable AS, are
       available to perform remote aircraft recoveries.
       14.26.1.2. Ensure enough individuals are qualified to perform and complete all
       anticipated tasks, including IPI and Red X sign-offs. Consider the experience level of the
       individuals you select when the need is identified to troubleshoot repeat/recurring
       discrepancies, especially those that caused in-flight emergencies or involve safety of
       flight. The MXG/CC has the authority to grant approval for a single person to sign off
       their own work when only one individual deploys on an MRT IAW TO 00-20-1.
       14.26.1.3. Ensure sufficient numbers of personnel, across all maintenance AFSCs, have
       official government passports, as applicable, to reduce deployment limitations and ensure
       adequate support of MRT taskings.
       14.26.1.4. Ensure the MOC is informed of personnel and equipment deployed in MRTs
       and status of the recovery.
14.27. Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS) Environment. This section outlines general policies
and procedures prescribed by the SSEA for peacetime operations, and expanded aircraft
servicing, maintenance, and weapons loading in PAS. Guidance is provided for nose-in, nose
out, and “double-stuff” using various aircraft operations and servicing.
   14.27.1. Procedures and Responsibilities. Use the information in this section, Lead
   Command instructions, AFOSHSTD 91-100, approved technical data, TO 00-25-172,
   specific TOs for aircraft servicing, equipment, and supply storage.
       14.27.1.1. The MXG/CC is responsible for PAS management at bases with permanently
       assigned aircraft, unless otherwise stipulated in contracting arrangements. If a PAS is
       used for other than its designed purpose, the using activity will return each PAS to its
       required readiness condition prior to receiving aircraft. Electrical equipment used for
       quality of life purposes must be designed for Class I Division 2 requirements as specified
       by the National Electrical Code. Equipment not meeting these requirements may be used
       only if they are powered by a dedicated circuit that can be de-energized during aircraft
       refueling by a single Class I Division 2 switch.
   14.27.2. PAS Marking. Develop permanent floor plans to reflect positions for fuel truck,
   aircraft, chocks, equipment, personnel cubicle, dispersed weapons, etc., for each style of PAS
   used. When double-stuffing aircraft, use a MXG/CC-approved option for aircraft positioning.
       14.27.2.1. Develop floor plans for augmentation forces and include in the units
       procedures supplementing this instruction.
       14.27.2.2. Paint aircraft taxi lines on the shelter access pad and continue into the PAS.
       Paint a yellow or red safety guideline for positioning fuel vehicles, beginning 10 feet
       from the shelter (outside) and extending into the shelter approximately 10 feet for
       refueling vehicles. Paint the safety guideline to align with the driver’s side of the vehicle,
       considering that the refuel vehicle will always be backed into the PAS.
   14.27.3. Electrical Requirements. Refer to TO 00-25-172, for second-and third-generation
   PAS. For first- and modified first-generation PAS, with aircraft placed on centerline in either
   nose-in or -out configuration, leave electrical power and wall lights on. Do not change switch
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                          295


  position until refueling is completed. Leave wall lights and under wing lights on if these
  lights are explosive-proof and the PAS is equipped with an operating ventilator.
  14.27.4. Refueling/Defueling Operations. Complete refuel/defuel servicing IAW technical
  data and criteria established in TO 00-25-172. During F-15 operations, the fuel truck may be
  positioned into the shelter during ammunition loading with the aircraft’s left engine running
  (nose-out configuration only), as long as no part of the fuel truck is directly in front of the F-
  15 gun firing line. Do not connect the fuel hose to the aircraft until the engine is shut down
  and the fuel truck is properly grounded.
  14.27.5. Shelter Doors. Aircraft are sheltered at the end of the duty day unless otherwise
  directed by local policies. Do not open PAS aircraft doors until ice, snow or debris is
  removed from the roller guide track and door roller path. Opening PAS aircraft doors with
  clogged door roller guides can cause severe damage to the door and door drive system.
  Ensure personnel have shelter door operating training before authorizing to operate.
     14.27.5.1. Fully open all PAS and exhaust/blast doors when aircraft engines are operated
     in the PAS. Recommend painting marks on the shelter walls/floors to indicate when at
     the fully open position.
     14.27.5.2. During real world situations when force protection measures are increased, or
     as directed by commanders, keep all PAS and exhaust/blast doors closed and secured to
     the greatest extent possible to protect critical assets.
     14.27.5.3. During strike-mission weapons loading operations for local exercises and
     higher HQ inspections, open PAS doors to the 10 foot mark, if applicable (depending on
     the style of door) and open one of the exhaust/blast doors while powered AGE or bomb
     lift vehicles are operating. If a PAS protecting critical assets is equipped with ventilation
     fans, BE will evaluate the local exhaust ventilation systems for predetermined operations
     inside a PAS with the doors closed to ensure no health hazard to personnel exists, then
     the PAS and exhaust/blast doors may be closed while powered AGE or bomb lift vehicles
     are operating.
     14.27.5.4. During normal operations, open PAS doors as specified in wing procedures, to
     facilitate safety, refueling, and ventilating hazardous exhaust vapors and fumes.
     Additionally, open PAS and exhaust/blast doors at least 50 percent when powered AGE
     is operated inside. With the approval of Wing Safety, PAS and exhaust/blast doors may
     remain closed during periods of inclement weather provided there is no safety risk, no
     refueling operation, no powered AGE operation, and no hazardous vapors/fumes risk
     within the PAS.
  14.27.6. Aircraft Engine Operation. Perform single-engine maintenance operations IAW
  MDS-specific guidance not to exceed 85 percent in the PAS. When performing engine
  ground operations on the apron outside the shelter, do not direct engine exhaust into the
  shelter.
  14.27.7. Aircraft Positioning inside the PAS. When positioning aircraft in a PAS for engine
  operations ensure aircraft is correctly positioned to accommodate safe operations and
  optimum engine performance.

  14.27.8. Aircraft Winching (Hot/Cold). Cold winch (aircraft engines not running) aircraft
  into the shelter using the appropriate aircraft technical data. If aircraft specific TOs do not
  exist, units will forward proposed cold-winching checklists to the Supported Command for
  approval prior to implementing. Hot-winching (aircraft engines are operating) is authorized
  provided an SSEA has been accomplished IAW AFOSHSTD 91-100.
      14.27.8.1. Base CE will set the winch configuration for the shelter based upon the
      primary assigned aircraft. Host units will develop a PAS facility maintenance program to
      ensure safe and efficient operations.
      14.27.8.2. Ensure personnel are not permitted aft of the aircraft main landing gear. This
      is considered a danger zone due to the possibility of winch cable breakage.
  14.27.9. Placement and Storage of Munitions in the PAS. Permit the placement or storage of
  munitions in a PAS only after carefully determining operational advantages to mission
  accomplishment. Site the PAS for explosives IAW AFMAN 91-201, and DoD 6055.9-STD,
  DoD Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards. Determine the amount of munitions
  placed in a PAS based upon expected peacetime, exercise, and wartime taskings. In no case
  will the sited net explosive weight (NEW) limits be exceeded. Additional guidance on
  explosive compatibility, angled storage of munitions, and missile separation distances is in
  AFMAN 91-201, DoD 6055.9-STD, and AFI 91-112, Safety Rules for US Strike Aircraft.
      14.27.9.1. In the United Kingdom, each PAS must be licensed by the Royal Air Force in
      addition to complying with the requirements of AFMAN 91-201, and DOD 6055.9-STD.
      Elsewhere, obtain host-government concurrence, if necessary, before implementation.
         14.27.9.1.1. Before placing munitions inside a PAS, develop wing procedures to
         govern storage and movement operations. Group commanders jointly coordinate on
         wing procedures. The security police, CE, munitions flight, and weapons and
         explosives safety officers will assist in preparation of the wing guidance. The WG/CC
         and host nation commander, where applicable, will approve the procedures. Units will
         forward a courtesy copy of the procedures to applicable MAJCOM. Munitions will
         not be positioned inside a PAS until wing procedures have been approved.
      14.27.9.2. Conventional Munitions in the PAS. In addition to the requirements in
      AFMAN 91-201 and DoD 6055.9-STD, the following conditions also apply:
         14.27.9.2.1. General purpose bombs and cluster bomb units may be stored in a PAS.
         Fuze limited quantities (sufficient to meet minimum wartime taskings) provided they
         are periodically verified as ”safe” by qualified munitions personnel (2W0XX or
         2W1XX). Verify the safety of fused munitions as follows:
             14.27.9.2.1.1. Upon initial delivery and positioning of munitions in PAS.
             14.27.9.2.1.2. After every download from an aircraft.
             14.27.9.2.1.3. When refueling with munitions positioned in PAS, provide fire
             protection IAW TO 00-25-172.
      14.27.9.3. Maintenance Actions for Emitting Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR).
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         297


        14.27.9.3.1. Do not conduct aircraft maintenance requiring antenna radiation while
        AGM-88 missiles are located inside the PAS or located inside another PAS that is in
        line with the aircraft transmitting antenna.
        14.27.9.3.2. Comply with the safety requirements of technical data for electro-
        explosive devices, cluster bomb units, guided bombs, electronic fuses, missiles, etc.,
        to prevent detonation from EMR.
     14.27.9.4. Secure low-risk and medium-risk munitions stored in PAS IAW AFI 31-101,
     The Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-201, Security Police Standards
     and Procedures.
        14.27.9.4.1. Do not place missiles or munitions inside the PAS in direct line of the
        aircraft exhaust or within 5 feet of the PAS exhaust port opening. Place missiles in
        PAS on MMHE-approved missile stands (limit quantities to meet minimum wartime
        taskings), all up-round containers, or on munitions trailers. Establish procedures for
        detecting tampering with missiles positioned in a PAS. The maximum inspection
        interval is 7 days.
        14.27.9.4.2. Munitions pre-positioning for one SCL of air-to-ground or air-to-air
        munitions can be accommodated by available floor space within every PAS. Place
        munitions on Y-stands, wooden dunnage, or specially designed racks. Maximum total
        munitions to be pre-positioned within any PAS is dependent upon the NEW
        restriction for that PAS. The unit’s SCL governs the types of munitions pre-
        positioned in shelters.
        14.27.9.4.3. Quantities of air-to-air and air-to-ground missile racks vary, depending
        on the type of PAS. Generally, four missile racks (eight missiles) will fit into a first
        generation shelter. Eight missile racks will fit into a modified first-, second-, or third-
        generation shelter (total 16 missiles per shelter). NOTE: Missile racks must possess
        loading adapter straps providing durable, adjustable, positive locking for holding all
        types of missiles. Mount these racks to a single surface (PAS wall or PAS floor; not
        both) within the shelter. Secure missiles with straps at all times.
        14.27.9.4.4. Place missiles on MMHE-approved missile racks with the nose pointing
        toward the rear of the shelter. Maintain missile warhead separations IAW AFMAN
        91-201 and DoD 6055.9-STD. If missile warhead separation cannot be maintained,
        alternate missile positions; that is, nose-to-rear, nose-to-front. This should provide
        proper warhead alignment IAW AFMAN 91-201 and DoD 6055.9-STD and preclude
        any violations to sited NEW. NOTE: Descriptions identifying differences between
        PAS generations are in TO 00-25-172. Position missile racks as follows:
            14.27.9.4.4.1. In first generation shelters, position AIM-9 racks near the aircraft
            wings and forward of AIM-9 Launchers. This will enable the bomb lift truck to
            maneuver between the racks and the aircraft.
            14.27.9.4.4.2. In modified first generation shelters, position AIM-9 missile racks
            closest to the aircraft wings. The AIM-7/AIM-120 racks are positioned forward of
            the AIM-9 racks.
            14.27.9.4.4.3. In second and third generation shelters, position five to seven
 298                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


              missile racks along the right wall and one missile rack along the left wall. Locate
              AIM-9 missile racks closest to the aircraft.
   14.27.10. Collocating Nuclear and Conventional Munitions (AF Munitions). Peacetime
   collocation of conventional munitions and nuclear weapons is not permitted. This does not
   include aircraft configured in an authorized strike configuration for a nuclear generation or
   alert operation. Refer to AFI 91-101 and applicable AFI 91-series for Weapons System
   Safety rules.
   14.27.11. External Fuel Tank Storage. Operational, empty aircraft fuel tanks may be stored
   within the shelters on fuel tank racks. Ground the fuel tanks IAW aircraft TOs and TO 00-25-
   172. Cover fuel standpipes and strap down the tanks. The quantity of fuel tanks to be stored
   inside of a shelter depends upon the assigned MDS and the type of shelter that the aircraft is
   operating from. Typically, the number of tanks and tank locations will follow below
   guidance but units may develop alternate procedures when approved by Wing Safety and
   Wing Civil Engineering. Ensure procedures are incorporated into supplements/OIs to this
   AFI.
       14.27.11.1. In first-generation shelters housing F-16 aircraft, two tanks are stored inside
       each shelter. Store the tanks one above the other in the rear of the shelter above the
       aircraft winch. Variations to this configuration may be required due to individual shelter
       layout.
       14.27.11.2. In modified first-generation shelters housing F-15 aircraft, and second and
       third-generation shelters housing F-15/F-16 aircraft, four external fuel tanks are stored
       inside each shelter. Position two tanks, one on top of the other, on sides of the shelter
       within the rear 25 feet of the shelter.
14.28. Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)/Radar Threat Warning (RTHW) Testing.
   14.28.1. Testing and Reporting. The MXG/CC will appoint a RWR/RTHW manager. The
   RWR/ RTHW manager will coordinate test procedures with the wing electronic warfare
   officer (EWO) and the MXS, if applicable. The RWR/RTHW manager will ensure each
   AMU accomplishes the required minimum number of checks as defined below. NOTE:
   Aircraft with enhanced on-board diagnostics and internal testing capabilities do not require
   external testing during contingency and non-contingency operations.
       14.28.1.1. Every test will include a check of one signal per band and continuous wave
       (CW) if equipped.
       14.28.1.2. For contingency missions, check the RWR/RTHW on all applicable aircraft
       prior to first sortie of the day (or prior to placing on alert status). When an aircraft is
       found to have a malfunctioning RWR/RTHW system, the AC determines the course of
       action based on operational needs and requirements.
       14.28.1.3. For non-contingency missions, follow technical data or Lead Command
       guidance to determine the frequency and requirements. Where conflicts exist, adhere to
       most stringent guidance.
14.29. Ramp Inspection Program.
   14.29.1. Public Law 99-661 requires a pre-flight safety inspection of all internationally
   scheduled charter missions for the transportation of members of the Armed Forces departing
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         299


   the United States. Air Mobility Command (AMC) is lead for the DoD in the management and
   administration of the Ramp Inspection Program. The Ramp Inspection Program ensures all
   internationally chartered missions receive a pre-flight safety inspection IAW AMC
   Supplement 1 to AFI 21-101. AMC/A4M will coordinate with other MAJCOMs as required
   to accomplish ramp inspections to ensure the maximum efficiency and utilization of
   resources. When requested by AMC, MAJCOMs will provide support to reduce the TDY and
   manpower impact associated with the execution of this program.
14.30. Red Ball Maintenance.
   14.30.1. The term “Red Ball” is a traditional descriptor, recognized throughout aircraft
   maintenance, and defines a situation requiring a sense of urgency and priority actions. “Red
   Ball” maintenance normally occurs two hours prior to launch and until aircrew have released
   the aircraft back to maintenance. The Red Ball maintenance concept is intended to prevent
   late takeoffs and aborts by having qualified maintenance personnel available (e.g., in a truck
   or standby in the shop) during launch and recovery operations to troubleshoot, isolate, and
   repair system malfunctions. Red Ball maintenance in no way authorizes technicians to take
   shortcuts or deviate from TOs, personnel safety requirements or fail to properly document the
   aircraft forms and the MIS for all completed repair actions. Units will ensure all maintenance
   repair actions (does not apply to incorrect switch settings due to operator error) are
   documented in the aircraft forms and MIS during Red Ball, launch, or EOR operations and
   cleared from the aircraft forms prior to flight. Maintenance repair actions must be cleared in
   the MIS as soon as possible. It is imperative that maintenance documentation is performed
   regardless of the timing of the action in the generation and launching of the aircraft are input
   and cleared from the forms prior to flight. If aircraft status changes, an ER must be re-
   accomplished by a certified individual upon completion of maintenance and before the
   aircraft is released for flight IAW TO 00-20-1. NOTE: When the MIS is down, develop
   procedures to ensure the appropriate documentation is completed as soon as the system is
   operational.
   14.30.2. Red Ball Maintenance Procedures.
      14.30.2.1. TOs, tools, rags, parts, unused supplies and checklists will be accounted for
      before the aircraft is allowed to taxi/takeoff.
      14.30.2.2. Emphasis will be placed on FOD awareness/prevention during this critical
      maintenance operation.
   14.30.3. If aircraft engines are operating, a safety observer (maintenance or aircrew member)
   will maintain interphone communications or remain in full view of the flight crew and be
   positioned to maintain overall surveillance of the aircraft and personnel performing
   maintenance.
   14.30.4. Weapons loaded aircraft will be safed IAW applicable MDS and/or weapons
   specific technical data.
14.31. Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM/EDX) Master Chip
Detector Analysis Program (MCDP).
300                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


  14.31.1. General. This section establishes procedures for management of the Aircraft Engine
  Magnetic Chip Detector Debris Program for units with SEM/EDX machines, for all assigned
  F110-GE-100/-129 and F118-101 engines.

  be propulsion section NCOIC).
  14.31.3. All organizations requiring recurring chip detector analysis service shall identify by
  letter a primary and alternate MCDP monitor for their unit. Letters will include the phone
  numbers of both the primary and alternate monitors. The letter will be updated annually or
  when personnel or phone numbers change.
      14.31.3.1. All newly assigned MCDP monitors will attend a briefing by NDI lab. This
      briefing will cover the duties and responsibilities of all MCDP monitors.
  14.31.4. All MCDP Monitors or their representatives will ensure the following:
      14.31.4.1. Magnetic Chip Detectors (MCD) are submitted for debris analysis for their
      aircraft and assigned engines IAW TOs.
      14.31.4.2. Ensure MCD debris analysis is forwarded with the following information:
      AMU, rank/ name, aircraft serial number, engine serial number, total engine hours,
      date/time, visual chips, reason for analysis request and sortie number. This information
      will be annotated on Lead Command or locally developed form.
      14.31.4.3. Ensure all MCD debris analysis documentation errors are corrected as soon as
      possible when notified of the error by the NDI lab.
  14.31.5. Timely MCD analysis is critical to weapon system integrity and operational safety.
  Effective risk mitigation requires meticulous attention to ensure analysis is performed at
  prescribed technical data intervals. These intervals will not be exceeded.
      14.31.5.1. The NDI lab will:
         14.31.5.1.1. Complete analysis and notify MOC of results in sufficient time to meet
         TO directed notification intervals.
         14.31.5.1.2. MCD analysis indicating significant levels of M50 or other critical
         materials will be immediately reported to the MOC. MOC will in-turn contact the
         owning AMU to coordinate immediate return of affected aircraft to home station.
         14.31.5.1.3. Immediately notify test cell personnel of analysis results for engines in
         the test cell.

         MCD inspection is due.
     14.31.6.3. Ensure MCDs are submitted for analysis within 75 minutes after engine
     shutdown.
     14.31.6.4. Ensure current SEM/EDX levels are maintained for each aircraft serial
     number to indicate aircraft status relative to MCD analysis results.
     14.31.6.5. Coordinate with MOC to recall aircraft determined to be flying with
     unacceptable levels of debris.
  14.31.7. The MOC will:
     14.31.7.1. Serve as primary communication link for transfer of SEM/EDX information
     between the NDI lab and affected activities.
     14.31.7.2. Ensure current SEM/EDX levels are maintained for each aircraft serial
     number to indicate aircraft status relative to MCD analysis results, IAW system technical
     data.
     14.31.7.3. Immediately notify the owning AMU when MCD analysis indicates
     unacceptable levels of debris so they can coordinate recall of affected aircraft.
  14.31.8. Cross Country/Deployed MCDP Analysis Requirements.
     14.31.8.1. NDI will be notified prior to deployment to determine if MCDP support is
     available at the deployed location.
     14.31.8.2. If it is determined that MCDP is not available, visual MCD inspections will be
     performed IAW applicable engine directives.
  14.31.9. SEM/EDX Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) Training Requirements. This
  training is required in addition to qualification training (CFETP). The CAF/MCL is located
  on                   HQ                    ACC/A4Q                   web               site
  https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-TE-
  AC-42-2&Filter=OO-TE-AC-42.
     14.31.9.1. F110 Engine Oil System Awareness Training (OSAT) (Course
     C6ADU00TIV0110) is required for all 2A3X3, 2A6X1, and 2A7X2 personnel

       performing maintenance on F118 engines -- flightline, phase and backshop. Course is
       Interactive Multimedia Instruction through local Maintenance Training Section and must
       be completed within 90 days of assignment and annually.
14.32. Self-Inspection Program.
   14.32.1. The purpose of the unit self-inspection program is to provide commanders and
   supervisors a management tool to assess unit compliance with existing directives. The self-
   inspection program is intended to be an on-going process implemented at all organizational
   levels. Lead Commands will establish standardized program guidelines IAW 90-201 and
   develop checklists that incorporate applicable HAF/Lead Command checklists and checklist
   items from local instructions. The self-inspection program not only enables units to gauge
   compliance with directives, but also provides a method to assess established processes,
   identify deficiencies, and implement corrective measures. Continuously assessing,
   measuring, and improving processes serves to improve mission effectiveness and efficiency
   and favorably postures units for higher HQ inspections.
       14.32.1.1. MXG/CC and SQ/CCs will conduct a unit self-inspection within 45 days
       (ARC MXG/ CC will determine requirement) of assuming command.
   14.32.2. Program Guidelines: The unit self-inspection program must be tailored to the
   organization’s structure and mission. It should provide adequate coverage of the mission,
   resources, training, and people programs. Items not in compliance will be categorized as
   “Critical” or “Non-critical.” Problems identified should be categorized by mission impact
   and compliance with policies and efforts needed to fix problems. A feedback mechanism and
   reporting process will be established to ensure non-compliance items are tracked until
   resolved, waivered, or LIMFACs are reported formally. Maintain a formal copy of approval
   for waivered items. Open “Critical” items will be reported to the MXG/CC, tracked, and
   status updated quarterly until resolved. Open “Non-critical” items will be reported to the
   SQ/CC, tracked, and updated quarterly until resolved.
       14.32.2.1. Definition of Critical: Items identified as key result areas for successful
       mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-compliance
       would affect system reliability or result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, or
       litigation.
       14.32.2.2. Definition of Non-critical: Areas that require special vigilance and are
       important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-
       compliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result
       in injury, unnecessary cost, or possible litigation.
       14.32.2.3. In addition to Lead Command checklists, use locally developed checklists
       tailored to specific unit requirements. AFOSHSTDs contain sample checklists for unit
       self-inspections. Use OSHA inspections for workplaces with civilian personnel. See AFI
       91-301.
   14.32.3. OSHA inspections of AF contractor operations within the 50 states and US
   territories are authorized. These operations are subject to the enforcement authority of federal
   and state safety and health officials. See AFI 91-301.
14.33. Senior Leaders’ Maintenance Course (SLMC).
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                          303


  14.33.1. General. The AF Senior Leaders’ Maintenance Course (SLMC) is a Chief of Staff
  initiative developed to educate wing leadership on aircraft maintenance, operations, and
  flightline support in both expeditionary and home station environments. Its objectives
  include: strengthen the relationship and teamwork between operations, maintenance, and
  support; deepen insight into unit operations, maintenance, and support activities; and focus
  attention on policy, procedures, training, discipline, and enforcement.

     issues:
         14.33.2.2.1. For those who have already attended SLMC in a different MAJCOM.
         14.33.2.2.2. For cancellations once an officer has received a course date.
         14.33.2.2.3. For officers unable to attend training within 6 months of assignment.
  14.33.3. Attendance and Scheduling: The Lead Command OPR will identify and schedule
  wing leaders and will work with the Lead Command/DPO to track attendance. The annual
  frequency of the course will be determined by Lead Commands based on the population of
  senior leaders. Personnel from ARC units can attend another Lead Command’s course.
  14.33.4. Lead Command/CC (or CV in absence) sponsors and is expected to open the
  course.
  14.33.5. Lead Command/A4 (or equivalent) will normally plan and host the course, attend
  throughout, and present key briefings.
  14.33.6. Other briefings may be conducted by a SME. The briefer should be at least a
  colonel or civilian equivalent. A lower-ranking SME may brief by exception.
  14.33.7. The following topics are mandatory and must be presented (but may be adapted to
  each Lead Command’s mission): SORTS and ART (If Command applicable), WG/CC
  standup, using analysis functions, QA, flying hour program, planning and scheduling, nuclear
  issues (for units tasked with a nuclear mission), munitions operations, force
  sustainment/reachback (if applicable), maintenance discipline (technical data usage and tool
  control), aircraft status reporting, flying goals/standards/productivity/metrics, fleet health and
  aircraft availability, scheduled maintenance inspections, FOD/DOP, CANN and Hangar
  Queen management, maintenance training, safety/MRM, base repair capability, AFREP,
  IREP, supply issues (RSP, MICAP, and DIFM), LCAP/MSEP, and financial
  management/budget.
  14.33.8. The following are recommended topics that may be presented at the Lead
  Commands’ discretion and tailored to their specific mission, but not an all inclusive list of
  available topics: Deployment and AEF support issues, Base X case study, aircraft
  appearance, “Red Ball” maintenance, aircraft generation planning (dispersal and split
  operations), maintenance manning and retention, workforce management, asset tracking
  (ITV), mobility, logistics C2, net centric operations issues, CRFs, weapons system teams and

   roadmap, munitions provisioning process (requirements, distribution, and resupply), DCC
   program, RNI and AFSO21. In addition to maintenance specific topics, Lead Commands are
   encouraged to include other relevant mission support and operations topics that increase
   mission understanding and knowledge for the wing leadership team.
14.34. Special Certification Roster (SCR). The SCR is a management tool providing
supervisors a clear and concise listing of personnel who have been appointed to perform,
evaluate, and/or inspect work of a critical nature. Normally, only maintenance requirements that
have a definite potential for personnel injury or damage to equipment shall be included in the
SCR. Other tasks requiring special training or qualifications may be managed on the SCR. The
SCR is used to build personnel rosters for deployments, shift schedules, and assess workforce
capability. MXG CC and CD are not required to be on the SCR by virtue of their position as the
SCR approval authority.
   14.34.1. MXG/CC approves specific items identified in Table 14.1 Note 1.
       14.34.1.1. The MOO/MX SUPT (MXG/CC for ANG) approves individuals in their
       primary AFSC based on their experience and technical expertise regardless of their
       assigned skill position. Seven-skill level personnel may be certified outside their primary
       AFSC only when specific CUT task qualification is documented in their training records.
       EXCEPTION: WWM will approve WS SCRs. MXG/CEM approves SCR actions for
       those individuals administratively assigned to MOS (QA, AFREP, etc.) and FTD
       personnel (N/A to the ARC).
       14.34.1.2. The AFE Superintendent approves 1P0X1, AFE personnel in their primary
       AFSC based on their experience and technical expertise regardless of their assigned skill
       position. AFE personnel certified to clear "Red-X” discrepancies will be annotated on the
       SCR, or as determined by applicable Lead Commands. AFE sections will also follow AFI
       11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program and Lead Command directives.
       See Table 14.1 for SCR requirements.
       14.34.1.3. The SCR must be reviewed and signed semi-annually by the MOO/MX
       SUPT/AFE SUPT (MXG/CC for ARC) to verify all entries are current and accurate and
       to ensure task certifications have been completed. EXCEPTION: WWM will review and
       sign WS SCRs. MXG/CEM will review and sign SCR actions for those individuals
       administratively assigned to MOS (QA, AFREP, etc.) and FTD personnel.
   14.34.2. The MXG/CC can authorize selected 5-skill level personnel, in the rank of SrA or
   higher, for tasks normally requiring a 7-skill level requirement to facilitate the production
   effort. Waived 5-skill level personnel should be closely monitored and kept to the minimum
   required to accomplish the maintenance mission. MOO/MX SUPT or equivalent must
   maintain file copies of approved waivers. Approved waiver file copies may be discarded if
   SCR specifically identifies task as waived in the MIS. (ARC: must be maintained by MX
   supervision or equivalent until the SCR is updated and signed by the MXG/CC). Certified
   weapons load crew chiefs (load crew member position number 1) by virtue of their task
   certification and position serve as inspectors for weapons loading tasks only and do not
   require waiver. (2W0XX Certified Munitions Inspectors are exempt from these
   requirements.) Inspectors are CFETP qualified and appointed by the munitions flight chief or
   commander IAW AFI 21-201 and TO 11A-1-10, Air Force Munitions Surveillance Program
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                           305


    and Serviceability Procedures. NOTE: The OG/CC approves AFE personnel skill level
    waivers upon recommendation of the AFE Superintendent and MXG coordination.
       14.34.2.1. Lead Command Waiver Policy. If local conditions require assignment of
       other than mandatory SCR grade (to include civilian equivalents) and skill level
       prerequisite requirements, and cannot be fulfilled using the MXG/CC authority stated in
       14.34.2 then the MXG/CC (or equivalent) must request a waiver from the Lead
       Command.
    14.34.3. Lead Commands add other mandatory critical tasks or inspections they deem
    necessary. Identify each task on the SCR by a specific course code.
    14.34.4. SCR Documentation. Flight and section NCOICs will review each individual’s
    qualifications prior to recommending approval to perform SCR tasks to the appropriate
    approval level. The AF IMT 2426, Training Request and Completion Notification or Lead
    Command-approved (ANG locally approved) form is used by the work center supervisor to
    add or remove an individual to the SCR. Additionally, removal from the SCR may be
    accomplished by lining through the task on the SCR and notifying training section to update
    the MIS. The appropriate level approves the individual for addition to the SCR. On approval,
    the training management function loads the approved name into the MIS. Flight and section
    NCOICs retain their copy of AF IMT 2426 or Lead Command approved form until they
    verify proper loading. Appointment letters are not required if loaded in MIS.
       14.34.4.1. Work center supervisor, AMU/flight supervision, MOO/MX SUPT, SQ/ CC,
       or MXG/CC may decertify individuals at any time and remove them from the SCR.
    14.34.5. Ensure a current copy of the SCR is taken on all deployments.

          (jodt305c@jricp.osis.gov). Use of an alternate registration database should be
          approved by the governing agency in charge of the JSETS database. The governing
          agencies are the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) and the Electronic
          Services Command at Hanscom AFB, MA.
          14.36.1.1.2. Registration information must include, as a minimum, accurate point of
          contact information for the appropriate command post/command and control (C2)
          functions responsible for response to beacon alert messages. Refer to AFI 10-207,
          Command Posts for Command Post or C2 function responsibilities regarding 406
          MHz ELT and Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) systems.

          Administration (NOAA) SARSAT program Office’s National Beacon Registration
          Database (RGDB) that a beacon, or block of beacons, is registered with JSETS. This
          notification     is       made      through      the        following      website:
          (https://beaconregistration.noaa.gov/rgdb).
      14.36.1.2. Ensure procedures are established to update the ELT registration database
      whenever 406 MHz ELT–equipped aircraft are transferred to other commands/wings,
      ELTs that are taken out of service, removed for maintenance or destroyed.
      14.36.1.3. Ensure 406 MHz ELT system tracking procedures are established to provide
      readily accessible, accurate ELT status (including aircraft assignment and, when able,
      location) to the responsible command post/C2 functions.

  14.37.1. The MXG/CC will appoint an IFF Mode IV program manager.
      14.37.1.1. 100 percent of IFF-equipped possessed aircraft will be checked every 2
      months or as determined by aircraft specific technical data.
      14.37.1.2. Invalid Mode IV replies will not cause a CONUS training sortie to be aborted;
      however, a work order will be generated for maintenance after flight.
      14.37.1.3. Do not launch or enter aircraft into a contingency zone with a known
      inoperative Mode IV system, unless the contingency Area of Responsibility (AOR) has
      established procedures governing inoperative/degraded Mode IV capabilities.
      14.37.1.4. Lead Commands will determine additional requirements, as necessary, to
      ensure status of IFF Mode IV meets mission requirements.

   16.5.1. Once classification training is complete, egress personnel must successfully complete
   an AETC egress technician course for the specific aircraft to be maintained. EXCEPTION:
   ACES II-trained and certified egress SSgt 5-levels and above being reassigned to another
   base or unit maintaining ACES II-equipped aircraft are not required to complete the
   organizational maintenance (O/M; on-equipment) egress technician course. Whether or not
   these individuals attend the O/M course is the decision of the the Egress workcenter
   supervisor.
   16.5.2. Personnel are certified to perform egress systems maintenance by demonstrating
   adequate proficiency to a designated certifying official in the egress systems workcenter.
   Certification pass/fail criteria will be established by the egress workcenter supervisor.
   Document certification in accordance with AFI 36-2201. Retrain any individual who fails the
   practical evaluation until the individual demonstrates adequate proficiency or withdraw the
   individual from training. If egress personnel are withdrawn from training, retrain in
   accordance with AFI 36-2201.
16.6. Initial Certification of Non-Egress Personnel:
   16.6.1. Non-egress personnel must successfully complete an AETC egress technician course
   for the specific aircraft to be maintained. EXCEPTION: AFE personnel do not have to
   complete the technician course unless they are to be employed as egress augmentees.
   16.6.2. After completing the AETC technician course, non-egress personnel will be initially
   certified in accordance with paragraph 5.2. Non-egress personnel will also be recertified in
   accordance with paragraph 16.5.2.

   with AFI 36-2201.
16.9. Using Newly Assigned Uncertified Egress Personnel:
   16.9.1. Newly assigned uncertified egress personnel may assist in performing egress systems
   maintenance. These personnel will never clear (sign off) AFTO Form 781-series entries MIS
   or condition tags.
16.10. Egress/Cockpit Familiarization Training:
   16.10.1. The intent of egress familiarization training is to ensure non-egress personnel are
   aware of the hazards associated with an egress system and what to do if a hazard exists. As a
   minimum, initial and refresher (24-month) egress/cockpit familiarization training will include
   location and installation procedures of egress system safety devices, cockpit entry/exit
   procedures, procedures for determining whether or not an egress component is expended,
   emergency procedures associated with an expended egress component, and local
   maintenance concerns identified by the egress workcenter supervisor.
   16.10.2. Only egress personnel, certified on assigned egress system(s), will conduct egress
   familiarization training. EXCEPTION: MTF personnel may conduct this training provided
   they have met requirements contained in paragraphs 16.6 and 16.7. Non-egress personnel
   may administer training media (slide show/video) during refresher familiarization training.
   Direct all students to the egress section for any questions concerning course subject matter or
   technical assistance.
   16.10.3. Training media must meet approval of the 2A6X3 MFM or current media produced
   by the 367 TRSS listed on the Defense Imagery at http://www.defenseimagery.mil.
   16.10.4. All non-egress personnel who access aircraft cockpits with egress systems must
   complete initial and refresher familiarization training.
   16.10.5. The egress workcenter supervisor reviews and validates all egress familiarization
   training documents at least every 24-months.
   16.10.6. Initial egress familiarization training will be hands-on using an aircraft. Units
   desiring to use an aircraft maintenance trainer instead of an aircraft must submit a request
   through their group commander to the Lead Command Director/Chief of Maintenance (A4M
   or equivalent) for approval/disapproval.
   16.10.7. Refresher familiarization training may be conducted using an aircraft, maintenance
   trainer, and/or any media desired by the egress workcenter supervisor.
   16.10.8. New personnel to the unit must receive initial familiarization training prior to
   accessing cockpits unless last duty position involved same mission design aircraft as current
   duty position. Personnel not requiring initial training will attend refresher training when they
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       317


   become due. Individuals overdue for annual egress familiarization training will not access
   aircraft cockpits until they complete familiarization training.
16.11. Units with Unique, Experimental, or Test Aircraft. If training courses are not
available through AETC, units must use interagency training before considering nongovernment
training sources. If courses in both of these sources are not available, units must establish a
documented training program that meets the intent of this AFI. The program must provide for
training by the most qualified personnel and must be approved by the MFM prior to
implementation.
16.11. (NASIC)Units with Unique, Experimental, or Test Aircraft. NASIC/GXF will
develop a documented, system specific egress familiarization training program as mission
dictates. The most qualified personnel for each system will be identified in the familiarization
training program for each system.
16.12. Egress Systems Inspections and Documentation:
   16.12.1. A certified egress production inspector will inspect any disturbed integral part of
   the egress system. The inspection must be an egress final inspection unless another
   inspection is prescribed by technical data.
   16.12.2. If an insufficient number of egress production inspectors are assigned, the group
   commander may grant waivers to highly qualified five-level egress journeymen, in the rank
   of SrA or higher, to perform as egress production inspectors. Waived journeymen will be
   closely monitored and kept to the minimum required to accomplish the maintenance mission.
   16.12.3. All systems Red X provisions. Only egress personnel will clear (sign off) egress
   system discrepancies.
   16.12.4. Egress personnel will conduct an egress final every 30 days on ejection seats whose
   personnel/recovery parachutes and/or survival kits are integral parts of the seat. Egress
   personnel will also conduct an egress final when any maintenance other than a visual
   inspection is performed on an integral part of an ejection seat.
   16.12.5. Cannibalization actions
       16.12.5.1. Egress system component CAD/PAD cannibalization actions are considered
       "High-Risk" and should not be performed unless priority aircraft are involved (i.e. higher
       headquarters/alert status), or lack of ready equipment will impede mission
       accomplishment.
       16.12.5.2. To ensure system integrity and validation of the explosive CAD/PAD listing,
       cannibalization of egress explosive components and/or seats will not be accomplished
       without the approval of the Maintenance Group or Deputy Group Commander.
       16.12.5.3. After cannibalization actions, Red X discrepancies in the aircraft AFTO IMT
       781A will not be cleared until the MIS 257 & 701 screens are verified. (2A6X3) Egress
       personnel will accomplish this action.
16.13. Aircraft Static Display. Aircraft placed on static display must be rendered safe in
accordance with 00-80G-series technical orders and AFMAN 91-201.

                                          Chapter 17

                      CENTRALIZED REPAIR FACILITIES (CRFS)

17.1. Introduction. CRFs, previously also called centralized intermediate repair facilities
(CIRFs), queen bees, etc, consolidate non-mission generation workloads for commodities such as
aircraft engines, electronic warfare pods, avionics line replaceable units, wheel and tire
assemblies, and other aircraft components. Management and control procedures will vary
depending on the specific logistical characteristics of the asset/commodity being repaired as well
as the type of aircraft and geographic region supported.
17.2. Organization. CRFs are normally established within existing maintenance organizations
(EMS, CMS, MXS), minimizing requirements for overhead and support.
17.3. Command Authority. CRF production oversight and monitoring is provided by a CRF
Command and Control (C2) Cell within the AFGLSC/Supporting Command Supply Chain
Management Group (SCMG). This cell will:
   17.3.1. Develop CRF policy in conjunction with Air Staff and MAJCOM staff agencies.
   17.3.2. Monitor CRF production.
   17.3.3. Prioritize and direct CRF commodity distribution within the enterprise IAW AF
   guidance.
   17.3.4. Coordinate and track retrograde and sustainment assets between supported units and
   the CRF.
   17.3.5. Utilize IT systems in conjunction with Supply Chain Weapon System Teams to
   determine enterprise health of all CRF commodities. Alert lead command of negative trends.
   17.3.6. Monitor transportation and repair pipeline velocity and intervene as needed.
   17.3.7. Identify and upchannel systemic policy driven transportation and supply difficulties
   to appropriate higher headquarters for resolution.
   17.3.8. Provide accurate and timely commodity appropriate status reports and metrics.
17.4. CRF Common Operating Picture (COP). Logistics and maintenance managers need
accurate and timely information to make command and control decisions over CRF activities.
To provide this information, a CRF COP has been established on the AF Portal to integrate
numerous legacy data systems with CRF decision support tools. Machine-to-machine interface
should be maximized to reduce duplicate manual data entry and the opportunity for induced
errors. The AF Portal, rather than direct office-to-office e-mail will be used to communicate
COP information to all CRF stakeholders.
17.5. Rotable Pools. Customer wait time (CWT) and transportation constraints may drive the
establishment of a centralized rotable pool (CRP) for Class VII end items such as engines and
pods to meet established weapons system availability goals. Use of a CRP reduces CWT by
maximizing timely placement of serviceable assets where they are needed most, in lieu of
waiting for the same item to be received, repaired, and shipped back to the originating supported
unit. Rotable pool size, compared to support unit spare levels, will be determined during
deliberate planning between appropriate SCMG CRF C2 and Lead Commands.
 320                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


17.6. Wing-Retained Tasks. Units supported by CRFs may retain a limited capability to
perform specific ILM necessary for mission generation. These wing-retained tasks and the
resources required to perform them (personnel, equipment, etc.) will be approved by Lead
Command and coordinated with the AFGLSC (every effort will be made to minimize and
standardize wing-retained tasks where possible). For constrained assets, wing-retained tasks
may include those performed within the expected turnaround time of the CRF pipeline and repair
times. Wing-retained task resources also provide capability for cannot-duplicate screening and
provide a local means to handle immediate or urgent-action TCTOs which would otherwise
require the dispatch of a CRF team or the return of all affected assets to the CRF.
   17.6.1. Cannibalization at supported units. When commodity LRU local retail stocks fall
   below mission requirements, retention of CRF-repaired end-items as “CANN assets” may be
   necessary. However, this should be the exception, and must be approved by the appropriate
   SCMG CRF C2 in coordination with the supported command Functional Manager. CRF C2
   will notify supporting unit of retained CANN asset.
17.7. Documentation. The CRF and supported units will maintain all required status,
inventory, and historical record documentation on CRF-repaired assets, including manual
methods, IMDS-CDB, G081, CEMS, RAMPOD, etc.
   17.7.1. Pod asset inventory, status and reporting requirements. CRFs and supported units
   will update RAMPOD daily in accordance with AFI 21-103 Chapter 10 AVIONICS POD
   SYSTEM INVENTORY, STATUS AND UTILIZATION REPORTING to include Tracking
   Control Numbers (TCN) and/or commercial carrier name if applicable as well as shipment
   date of transitory assets. Shipping container status and locations are maintained in
   RAMPOD and must be kept current by users.
17.8. Metrics. CRFs will report performance against various customer and production metrics
approved by Lead Command and coordinated with the AFGLSC. These may include customer
wait time; spares status; MICAP incidents/hours; average time on wing; production versus
requirement throughput; supply status; flow time; test station/test cell status; pipeline segment
times; and others as required. This data will be provided daily to CRF C2 as outlined in para.
16.8.1.
17.9. Liaison with Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS). CRF operations rely on a robust
relationship between maintenance, materiel management, and transportation. CRF pipeline
velocity must be sustained at a level supporting unit requirements. The host LRS with support
from the maintenance organization (EMS, CMS, MXS) will jointly establish written procedures
to ensure the rapid movement of retrograde and sustainment assets between the CRF and
supported units. CRF C2 Cell will maintain maintenance, transportation, and supply functional
experts to assist CRFs and supported units to resolve any maintenance, supply, and
transportation limitations.
17.10. Agile Combat Support (ACS) Planning. Deployed CRFs are highly scenario-
dependent. Considerations include: allocated deployment airlift; number of aircraft deploying;
number of forward operating locations (FOL); available CRF throughput and surge capacity;
spares levels; transportation modes and nodes; and force protection and other FOL factors. The
availability of intra- and inter-theater transportation will play a major role in determining the
feasibility of arranging CRF support.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                     321


  17.10.1. CRFs do not replace deployable intermediate-level maintenance, but work in
  concert with it. Depending on the scenario, a unit may be tasked to deploy all, some, or none
  of its ILM capability to the FOL or to the CRF at a forward support location (FSL) or
  CONUS support location (CSL).
  17.10.2. CRFs may be established to repair virtually any commodity and may include minor
  or major maintenance. Definitions of CRF support and retained tasks may vary from
  CONUS arrangements. All options should be considered to arrive at the best support concept
  for the supported commander.
  17.10.3. Modular, Scalable Organization. Lead commands will establish modular, scalable
  UTCs for CRF commodities to provide a tailored response for various deployment trigger
  points. UTC capabilities will range from CRF augmentation to establishing a new CRF at
  bare base locations. When CRFs are established by consolidating intermediate-level
  maintenance from several supported units, those units’ UTC requirements will transfer
  (devolve) to the CRF maintenance organization (EMS, CMS, MXS). Supported unit (flying
  unit) DOC statements and UTC MISCAP statements may need to be revised to accurately
  reflect mobility-tasked direct support units and their capabilities.
  17.10.4. AEF Planning and Execution. The lead wing MXG/CC will determine maintenance
  ACS requirements, to include CRFs. Except for extenuating circumstances, CRFs should be
  utilized to the maximum practical extent. Deploying ILM to the FOL should be avoided
  when possible. To minimize airlift requirements, the lead wing MXG/CC should ensure
  deploying units tailor their UTCs with respect to supporting CRF capabilities and
  prepositioned assets.
     17.10.4.1. CRF support requirements identified prior to unit deployment should be
     forwarded to the MAJCOM and CRF-supporting command and the AFGLSC (SCMG
     CRF C2). CRF support should also be an item of discussion at the AEF Planning
     Conference. Requirements identified after unit deployment should be forwarded through
     the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR)/A4 staff to the supporting command
     and the AFGLSC (SCMG CRF C2).
     17.10.4.2. The CRF supporting command will determine the best location for the CRF,
     appropriate spare levels, equipment, personnel, and CONOPS for each type of asset.
     These requirements and CONOPS should be reviewed and coordinated with supported
     commands every AEF cycle or as requirements dictate to ensure the best utilization of
     AF/DoD resources.
     17.10.4.3. The supporting SCMG will establish a CRF C2 Cell consisting of
     maintenance, transportation, and materiel management functional experts to perform C2
     functions in a supported/supporting relationship over applicable CRFs. The AF Portal
     should be used to report, track, monitor, and measure CRF commodities and operations.
     17.10.4.4. The supported COMAFFOR/A4 staff may designate a liaison element to
     coordinate with the CRF supporting command and applicable SCMG to determine the
     most expedient means to satisfy supported unit requirements.      The supported
     COMAFFOR/A4 has final authority on asset distribution to units under its OPCON.
     Where two or more COMAFFORs compete for CRF-repaired assets, the A4 staffs,
322                                            AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      supporting command, and applicable SCMG CRF C2 will reach agreement on
      distribution of serviceable assets to balance competing operational requirements.
      17.10.4.5. Gaining CRF Requirements. Gaining CRFs will analyze their maintenance
      capability against supported unit expected sortie and utilization rates to determine
      maximum surge production capability, with and without augmentation. Augmentation
      requirements for various trigger points (e.g., PAA deployed), along with any projected
      personnel and equipment shortfalls or LIMFACs (limiting factors) should be reported to
      the supported (owning) MAJCOM FAM. The Functional Area Manage (FAM) will
      review and forward requirements to the lead wing and AEF Center for tasking/resolution
      at the Planning Conference. If during execution, CRF performance or other factors (e.g.,
      lack of sufficient timely intra- or inter-theater airlift) prevent fulfillment of combatant
      command support requirements, the supported command, supporting command, and
      applicable SCMG CRF C2 will explore other options to support the FOL.
         17.10.4.5.1. Gaining CRFs will review their CHPMSK levels to determine if they are
         adequate to support deploying units and will request appropriate adjustments, as
         necessary. The supporting command LSC will assist with kit management and
         replenishment.
         17.10.4.5.2. Gaining CRFs and the CRF C2 cell will closely monitor distribution of
         serviceable assets among CRPs.
      17.10.4.6. Deploying Unit Requirements.
         17.10.4.6.1. Deploying units will segregate Readiness Spares Package (RSP) items
         supporting a “remove, repair, and replace” capability and will deploy with the RSP
         according to the applicable UTC package. Depending on the supporting CRF
         manning and equipment posture, personnel and equipment may need to be deployed
         to the CRF.
         17.10.4.6.2. Deploying units operating with CRF-repaired pods will tailor spare asset
         packages to match the expected CRF level of support.
         17.10.4.6.3. Except for approved retained tasks, deploying units will operate under
         the CRF concept, maximizing use of the RSP and CRF support. For CRF operations
         to be successful and meet deployed unit expected customer wait times, units must
         prepare unserviceable assets for shipment as soon as repair at the CRF is deemed
         warranted. Retention of “CANN assets” at supported units must be approved by the
         appropriate SCMG CRF C2 in coordination with the supported command Functional
         Manager.
         17.10.4.6.4. Shipping Containers. CRF support relationships require assets to be
         shipped between deployed locations and the CRF. Deploying units will deploy with
         sufficient reusable containers to transport assets to and from the CRF.
         17.10.4.6.5. Redeploying supported units will coordinate closely with the applicable
         SCMG CRF C2 and supported MAJCOM staff to ensure unserviceable CRF
         supported commodities/assets are not left at the FOL. As a supported unit nears the
         end of its deployment, resupply times should be considered prior to shipping
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                 323


        serviceable/unserviceable assets. If the supported unit cannot be resupplied before
        redeployment, they will redeploy with the unserviceable asset.
  17.10.5. CRF EXPRESS Tool. CRF EXPRESS automatically drives induction of NSN
  listed assets through Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S) daily across the enterprise.
     17.10.5.1. The applicable CRF C2 cell will monitor EXPRESS, ES-S and all applicable
     applications daily; they will also recommend manual inductions of LRUs to fulfill
     shortfalls in the pipeline across the enterprise.
     17.10.5.2. Based on mission needs, manual intervention of EXPRESS managed
     commodities will be directed by the applicable SCMG CRF C2 Cell as required using
     locally developed procedures in-line with current IT capability.

                                          Chapter 18

                               CONTRACT SURVEILLANCE

18.1. Government Contract Quality Assurance. See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
Part 46. Successful contract performance is dependent upon positive open communication
between the Procuring Contracting Officer / Administrative Contracting Officer (PCO/ACO),
Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE), and the performance-based activity. It is imperative that all
parties strive to achieve and maintain an atmosphere of mutual understanding and cooperation.
Successful strategies may include regularly scheduled meetings between the government
program management office personnel and the performance-based activity to discuss inspection
results, trends, and other items of mutual interest. The QAE and performance-based activity are
not adversaries; they are partners who share the same goal - successful mission accomplishment.
NOTE: for the purposes of this instruction QAE is synonymous with quality assurance
representative (QAR), contracting officers technical representative (COTR), and contracting
officers representative (COR).
   18.1.1. MAJCOMs shall designate a program management function, i.e., government
   program management office, to oversee and manage the requirements for each contract
   management plan. For the purposes of this instruction the Continuing Government
   Organization (CGO) required In Accordance With (IAW) Office of Management and Budget
   (OMB) Circular A-76 is synonymous with government program management office. The
   government program office is the single focal point for the performance-based activity to
   communicate performance results, identify issues beyond their control, and solicit guidance
   and interpretations.
18.2. Management of Government Property. See FAR Part 45. Air Force Equipment
Management System (AFEMS) and Information Processing Management System (IPMS) shall
be used to manage government property possessed by performance-based activities to the
maximum extent possible. AFEMS shall be used to manage Equipment Authorized Inventory
Data (EAID) accountable property only. Manage non-EAID accountable property IAW
procedures in the Performance Management Assessment Plan (PMAP). For the purposes of this
document, PMAP is referred to as Performance Plan (PP) to avoid confusion with Procurement
Management Assessment Program. Property management is a joint responsibility of the
performance-based activity, PCO/ACO, and government program management office.
18.3. Contract Administration. See FAR Part 42. The contracting officer, PCO or ACO is the
OPR for contract administration. The program management office is the Office of Collateral
Responsibility (OCR) for executing the contract administration tasks as determined by the
PCO/ACO.
18.3. (NASIC)Contract Administration. The in-house NASIC/GXF services contract is
administered by a Contractor Officer (external to NASIC), a Client Representative (CR)
(NASIC/XPQ) and a Technical Monitor (TM) (NASIC/GXF). The CR will ensure the contractor
performs the technical requirements of the contract, monitor contractor performance, monitor
implementation, verify receipt of service and authorize payments. In addition, the CR will notify
the contracting officer of any contractor deficiencies and serve as the customer organization's
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                       325


point of contact for technical issues. The Technical Monitor will be responsible for monitoring,
assessing, and communicating the contractor’s technical performance.
   18.3.1. The PCO/ACO is the OPR for issuing contract modifications; making changes,
   correcting errors, executing options, adding new requirements, etc.    The program
   management office is the OCR for issuing and identifying the need for contract
   modifications. The Functional Commander / Functional Director (FC/FD) and the quality
   assurance personnel are the best sources for inputs on the need for making changes,
   correcting errors, executing options, adding new requirements, etc.
18.4. Contracting Officer. The PCO/ACO is responsible for overseeing the administration of a
contract and is the only individual with the legal authority to act as an agent between the
government and the contractor. This legal authority, provided under federal law, gives a
PCO/ACO the power to enter into, modify, interpret, and terminate a contract on behalf of the
government. The greatest responsibility of the PCO/ACO is to ensure the contractor's
performance satisfactorily meets contractually agreed upon standards as stated in the contract
Section C requirements document.
18.5. FC/FD Role. The FC/FD is the government’s functional authority for the contracted
function. The FC/FD retains all responsibility for the success or failure of the contracted
function, the same as if the contracted function was an organic activity. The functional area
includes all maintenance activities as defined in the contract Section C requirements document.
In addition to the duties and responsibilities outlined in AFI 63-124, the FC/FD shall:
   18.5.1. Keep up-to-date on mission changes that could affect creation of a contract
   modification.
   18.5.2. Ensure the development of a PP that effectively measures and evaluates contractor
   performance throughout the life of the contract or management plan.
   18.5.3. Review problem areas and when applicable coordinate with the PCO/ACO to resolve
   the problems. If the problem cannot be resolved, request assistance through command
   channels.
   18.5.4. Review documents related to default/recompete prior to scheduled recompetition;
   contract Section C requirements document or scope of work modifications; changes to award
   fee plan (if applicable) to new or revised DoD, AF, MAJCOM, and local directives.
   18.5.5. Coordinate waiver requests with the MAJCOM/A4 staff when initiated by the
   contractor.
   18.5.6. Ensure the use of performance-based contract assessment tools (e.g. process and
   systems audits, compliance checklists, random sampling or other frequency-based inspection
   methods, etc.) to monitor contractor submission of required reports according to the contract
   Section C requirements document, management plan.
   18.5.7. Ensure that the government program office uses surveillance methods to monitor
   contractor performance IAW federal, state, and local environmental laws and AF directives.
   18.5.8. Ensure development of a contingency plan/strike plan for tasks identified as essential
   IAW DoDI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DoD Contractor Services During Crisis, and
   annually coordinate with PCO/ACO to revise, update, or change it.
 326                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   18.5.9. Establish procedures for technical evaluation of contractor-submitted engineering
   change proposals.
   18.5.10. Participate as a voting member of the award fee/term review board, as applicable.
   18.5.11. Designate QAEs for Combat Logistics Support / Contract Field Team (CLS / CFT)
   contracts using lead MAJCOM procedures, consult applicable lead MAJCOM/A4M for
   further guidance. When government quality assurance for CLS/CFT contracts is delegated to
   the unit, ensure the acquisition activity responsible for the contract provides a written
   memorandum of agreement with the cognizant ACO or provides a quality assurance letter of
   instruction (QALI) to the ACO, as required, to identify specific and/or unusual quality
   requirements per AFI 63-501.
   18.5.12. Review and approve monthly surveillance schedules.
   18.5.13. Ensure QAEs are not assigned additional duties that interfere with their ability to
   fully meet requirements of contract surveillance and other QAE duties. QAE’s are not
   exempt from additional duties, the intent is that additional duties do not interfere with the
   primary role of contract surveillance and other QAE duties.
   18.5.14. Review contractor developed publications for acceptance prior to final signature
   and implementation.
   18.5.15. Ensure that any traditional responsibilities (i.e. Propulsion Flight Chief acting as the
   wing 2A6X1 AFSC functional manager, providing technical guidance to maintain propulsion
   systems to support the wing mission) normally performed by military personnel are
   identified. If those duties are required and are not appropriate for the contractor to
   accomplish, identify those requirements to the responsible Commander for appointment of
   the most qualified personnel.
18.6. Chief QAE. The chief QAE ensures contractor performance is surveilled IAW criteria
outlined in the PWS and performance plan. They are also responsible for reporting all
performance assessment results through the FC/ FD to the PCO/ACO for disposition. The chief
QAE fulfills these responsibilities by overseeing the QAEs that have been delegated inspection
and acceptance authority by the PCO/ACO. QAEs may also serve as Government Flight
Representatives as outlined in AFI 10-220.
   18.6.1. Responsibilities. Organizations with a single QAE position shall utilize this
   individual as both the Chief QAE and QAE. Initial certification and annual evaluations shall
   be accomplished by the FC/FD. Chief QAEs shall perform the following:
       18.6.1.1. Review the contractor inspection system, quality program or other means used
       for control quality and comply with contract Section C requirements. Submit comments
       through FC/FD to PCO/ACO for disposition.
       18.6.1.2. Annually review and revise checklists, performance requirements document,
       evaluation guides, etc. for currency and completeness.
       18.6.1.3. Ensure that each area surveilled has a primary and alternate QAE assigned to
       ensure contract surveillance is accomplished. NOTE: Alternate QAEs must possess a
       maintenance-related AFSC, or applicable civilian series, if they are responsible for
       surveilling aircraft or aircraft trainer maintenance functions or tasks. NOTE: If an
       organization has only one QAE position, than an alternate is not required
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      327


       18.6.1.4. Ensure QAE positions are filled via applicable MAJCOM procedures when
       they become vacant.
       18.6.1.5. Perform an initial evaluation on each QAE to determine past qualifications,
       experience, and ability to accomplish technical inspections and contract surveillance
       functions. Each evaluator must be qualified in the appropriate area before performing
       evaluations, inspections, or surveillance duties unsupervised.        Document initial
       evaluations for all QAEs (primary and alternates) in the individuals training records or
       MIS.
       18.6.1.6. Perform annual over-the-shoulder (OTS) evaluations of each primary and
       alternate QAE in the performance of surveillance activities. The purpose of this
       evaluation is to ensure proficiency in surveillance techniques. Document the results of
       the evaluation in the QAE's training records. In large units, this responsibility may be
       delegated to the QAE superintendent, or equivalent.
       18.6.1.7. Develop and publish a monthly schedule of QAE surveillance activities (label
       as FOUO). Distribute the schedule to the FC/FD and contracting officer for approval no
       later than the 5 duty days before the beginning of the period it covers or as required by
       MAJCOM or unit level procedures. Maintain copies of all schedules on file for the life
       of the contract.
       18.6.1.8. Collect, analyze and report award fee data at the end of each award fee period
       using applicable award fee evaluation plan.
       18.6.1.9. Supplement and perform surveillance activities as required.
       18.6.1.10. Develop and maintain the PP and associated contract performance assessment
       documentation IAW ACO/PCO guidelines.
       18.6.1.11. Provide assistance to the wing safety office, or equivalent, in mishap and
       incident reporting if required.
       18.6.1.12. Review contractor developed publications (wing/group instructions) prior to
       acceptance and publication to ensure they meet all contractual requirements and do not
       conflict with local, MAJCOM, or AF instructions.
       18.6.1.13. Ensure that discrepancies discovered by QAEs are documented in the
       appropriate aircraft or equipment forms, and in MIS. QAEs will follow-up to ensure the
       contractor takes corrective actions and preventive actions.
       18.6.1.14. Evaluate contractor proposals and provide comments and recommendations to
       the FC/FD and ACO/PCO.
       18.6.1.15. Develop a QAE training program.
       18.6.1.16. Verify and validate contractor submitted performance indicators.
       18.6.1.17. Assist the ACO/PCO in managing Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).
18.7. QAE. The QAE role is to observe, then document the overall performance of the
contractor without duplicating or augmenting the contractors Quality Control (QC) function.
The QAE is not part of the contractors Quality Control function. Additionally, QAEs protect the
 328                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


government’s interest by being the eyes and ears of the FC/FD and PCO/ACO concerning
contractor performance. QAEs also provide technical support to the FC/FD and PCO/ACO.
18.7. (NASIC)QAE. The TM’s role is to observe and document the overall performance of the
contractor per the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan and AFI 21-101 chapter 18. The
Squadron’s Chief Engineer will be the TM. The TM through the CR will provide a monthly
overall evaluation of the contractor’s performance to the Contracting Officer (or Contracting
Officer’s Representative).
   18.7.1. Responsibilities. The QAE is responsible for a wide range of surveillance
   requirements related to the surveillance of maintenance contracts. Specifically, the QAE
   will:
       18.7.1.1. Know and understand the specifications and requirements of the contract.
       18.7.1.2. Know and maintain proficiency in performance based contract assessment
       methods.
       18.7.1.3. Know and apply the procedures for documenting surveillance.
       18.7.1.4. Perform surveillance according to the PP.
       18.7.1.5. Attain qualification in the appropriate areas before performing evaluations,
       inspections, or surveillance duties unsupervised.
       18.7.1.6. Maintain technical competency in their assigned surveillance area.
       18.7.1.7. Review incoming and outgoing official government                  and contractor
       correspondence, as applicable to what the QAE has to surveille.
       18.7.1.8. Review deficiencies, TCTO, and mishap contractor reports for accuracy,
       adverse trends, and mission accomplishment. Additionally, review contractor logistics
       reports and forward to the MAJCOM through the FC/FD for possible indicators of
       performance trends.
       18.7.1.9. Evaluate the effectiveness of the contractor's involvement in mishap
       investigations IAW AFI 91-204.
       18.7.1.10. Serve as a member of the source selection team when required.
       18.7.1.11. Develop monthly surveillance schedules.
       18.7.1.12. Perform Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) duties, if required.
       18.7.1.13. Maintain proficiency in the MIS used during surveillance activities.
18.8. QAE/FC/FD training requirements. The FC/FD and chief QAE are responsible for
ensuring QAEs receive required training. The following training requirements apply to all
QAEs:
   18.8.1. Initial contract surveillance related training. Initial QAE contract surveillance related
   training consists of formal training conducted in two phases. QAEs will complete this
   training prior to performing surveillance duties.
       18.8.1.1. Phase I, General QAE Orientation Training. The Quality Assurance Program
       Coordinator (QAPC) shall provide the training IAW AFFARS Mandatory Procedure
       5346.103.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                        329

     TopOfPage.
     18.8.1.2. Phase II, Contract Specific Training. Training must be completed for each
     contract to which the FC/FD and QAE is assigned. The FC/FD ensures the PCO/ACO
     provides this training as required by AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5346.103, The
     Quality              Assurance           Program,          paragraph         2.b.(2).
     http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/af_afmc/affars/MP5346.103.htm#
     TopOfPage.
     18.8.1.3. Refresher Training. Refresher training must be completed at least annually for
     the purpose of staying current on all contract and performance management assessment
     plan changes.
  18.8.2. MAJCOM Training.      MAJCOMs will determine recurring QAE training
  requirements as needed to ensure QAEs remain current on new or changed contract
  surveillance concepts.
  18.8.3. QAE Qualification Training. The Chief of QAE must use a mixture of Cross
  Utilization Training (CUT) and On the Job Training (OJT) to ensure all contract Section C
  requirements are comprehensively and competently surveilled without interruption due to
  lack of QAE qualification.
     18.8.3.1. CUT training. The FC/FD and/or chief QAE and alternate QAEs will use CUT
     training to the extent necessary to ensure all contract requirements are surveilled by
     qualified QAEs.
     18.8.3.2. OJT training. The FC/FD and/or chief QAE ensures that QAEs are familiar
     with surveillance and documentation methods/procedures, development of surveillance
     schedules, and familiarization with emergency procedures if contractor performance is
     interrupted by default or strike.
  18.8.4. QAE training certification. QAEs will be knowledgeable of the tasks they surveil.
  QAEs are not required to be certified on specific tasks; rather, they are duty-position
  qualified to inspect, surveil, and observe according to the requirements in this instruction and
  other applicable directives. (NOTE: Special emphasis will be placed on knowledge and
  surveillance requirements for tasks requiring special certification.)
     18.8.4.1. QAEs requiring special certification authority (Red X, IPI, etc.) shall comply
     with the requirements in Chapter 14.
  18.8.5. QAEs performing surveillance on fuel systems or fuel maintenance facilities must be
  familiar with all associated safety requirements prior to performing the surveillance (see TO
  1-1-3).
  18.8.6. QAEs performing surveillance of munitions activities must be familiar with the
  requirements of AFI 21-201 prior to performing munitions activity surveillance. QAEs
  performing surveillance activities of civilian contractors performing MQ-1/MQ-9 munitions
  loading or unloading operations will comply with weapons academic training per Chapter
  12 of this AFI.
  18.8.7. QAEs responsible for surveilling egress operations at contract organizations will
  receive familiarization training per Chapter 16 of this instruction.
 330                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


   18.8.8. QAE training records. Training records documenting QAE training shall be
   maintained IAW AFI 36-2201 and the CFETP (or civilian equivalent system) prior to
   performing the surveillance. As a minimum, all QAEs (regardless of grade or skill level)
   must maintain an ITP in TBA (or civilian equivalent training records/system) that identifies
   specific responsibilities required by this instruction or other applicable directives.
   18.8.9. FC/FD contract surveillance related training. All FC/FD must successfully complete
   training within 30 days of assignment.
18.9. PP. The purpose of a PP is to provide a planned process for surveilling the contractor's
actual performance, and comparing that performance against the contractual requirements to
determine conformity with the technical requirements of the contract. The PP shall identify and
describe the roles and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining the following key
elements of managing and executing a contract performance management assessment program:
See Figure 18.1.

Figure 18.1. Key Elements.
i. Performance Assessment Planning & Preparation
ii. Performance Assessment
iii. Performance Assessment Results Analysis
iv. Performance Assessment Reporting
v. Performance Assessment Follow-up
vi. Performance Assessment Report Closure
   18.9.1. PP development. PP development is mandatory for all AF units that fall under the
   purview of this instruction. It is the responsibility of the FC/FD and Chief QAE to ensure
   that a PP effectively measures and evaluates a contractor. When properly developed the PP
   provides QAEs with information to identify acceptable performance and potential reasons for
   any nonconforming performance.
   18.9.2. PP inspection elements. Items included in the applicable contract Section C
   requirements document are required PP inspection elements.
       18.9.2.1. Identify additional contract surveillance requirements in the PP.           PP
       surveillance will be based on the minimum surveillance necessary to assess effective and
       efficient contractor compliance to performance work statement requirements.
       Surveillance methods shall be based on performance-based contract assessment methods
       and techniques. The PP shall avoid using traditional legacy system methods such as
       stove-pipe checklists and constant inspection.
       18.9.2.2. Identify and describe performance-based contract assessment techniques and
       their application. The PP shall also describe how to document and report exceptional and
       unacceptable performance.
       18.9.2.3. Establish and assign responsibilities in the PP for verifying costs of
       reimbursable items, to include items purchased through the micro-purchase program,
       when applicable.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                         331


       18.9.2.4. Establish procedures to review, evaluate, and provide comments and
       recommendations to contractor proposals. These proposals are for contract modifications
       not for new contracts.
       18.9.2.5. Include procedures for development, and coordination of monthly surveillance
       schedules.
       18.9.2.6. Ensure contractor hours of operation are surveilled on a random basis to
       include all shifts, weekends, and holidays the contractor works.
       18.9.2.7. The scope of contract performance assessment or inspection shall be based on
       past performance, mandatory, statutory, and regulatory requirements. Performance
       assessment planning shall consider operational risk, service complexity, and criticality as
       factors in deciding the performance assessment plan from month to month.
   18.9.3. PP format. The PP is developed IAW requirements of AFI 63-124, this instruction,
   and applicable MAJCOM guidance.
18.10. Surveillance Scheduling. The QAE will develop a monthly schedule of surveillance
activities based on PP requirements. The schedule must be completed no later than five duty
days prior to the beginning of the period it covers. The FC/FD must review and return the
schedule to the QAE no later than the last day of the month preceding the scheduled month. The
chief QAE must provide a copy of the schedule to the PCO/ACO before the start of the
surveillance period. Post changes to scheduled observations as they occur and send copies to the
PCO/ACO and FC/FD as requested.
   18.10.1. If minimum monthly surveillance requirements cannot be met due to equipment
   nonavailability or special circumstances, an explanation on the summary for each missed
   area and/or inspection category is required. In such cases an approval statement from the
   FC/FD and PCO/ACO for the variance is required.
   18.10.2. The chief QAE shall adjust surveillance activities commensurate with contractor’s
   performance and level of risk to the government should the contractor not perform in an
   acceptable manner. If a particular function of the contractor’s performance has a continuing
   record of acceptable performance and unacceptable performance would not likely result in
   loss of life to AF personnel or damage to government property, surveillance of that function
   should be reduced. If contractor performance of a function is less than satisfactory,
   surveillance of that function should be increased. When this is determined to be appropriate,
   the chief QAE, with FC/FD and PCO/ACO approval, will adjust the surveillance schedule.
18.11. Inspections.
   18.11.1. Technical inspections. Technical requirements of a contract are surveilled by
   performing technical inspections. Any maintenance task accomplished in accordance with
   technical guidance, (TO, work-card, etc.) qualifies for QAE surveillance under the technical
   inspection concept. Inspections may be performed while maintenance is being performed
   (concurrently) or after the fact. QAEs surveilling contracts that do not have technical
   inspections specifically addressed in this instruction will use the procedures in this paragraph
   to perform technical inspections included in the PP. QAE accomplish technical inspections
   by evaluating the following:
332                                           AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


      18.11.1.1. Checking a minimum of 50 percent of the required inspection items.
      Normally, disassemblies of a part, removal of a stress panel, or similar actions are not
      necessary to accomplish a technical inspection.
      18.11.1.2. Review of the aircraft or equipment forms and the MIS for proper
      documentation (applicable to the job being surveilled); checking for proper and current
      technical data usage; proper tool usage; and after maintenance Foreign Object (FO)
      checks of the area in which the task was performed.
      18.11.1.3. Minimum technical inspection surveillance requirements/frequencies for
      applicable aircraft and trainer transient aircraft will be determined by each Lead
      MAJCOM. The FC/FD, PCO/ACO and chief QAE, using MAJCOM guidance will
      jointly determine any additional surveillance requirements associated with maintenance
      contracts.
      18.11.1.4. QAE activities surveilling AF maintenance contracts not specifically
      addressed in this chapter will use the contract Section C requirements document to
      determine technical area surveillance requirements. As a minimum, include a percentage
      of each technical inspection in the contractor's Quality Check (QC) program requirements
      outlined in the contract Section C requirements document.
      18.11.1.5. Technical Inspection ratings. Technical inspections will be rated as either
      conforms or non-conforms. Assign non-conforms ratings when one of the following
      conditions occurs:
         18.11.1.5.1. A step serious enough to adversely affect the performance of the
         equipment involved is omitted or improperly completed.
         18.11.1.5.2. A major or Red X discrepancy is detected.
         18.11.1.5.3. The performance threshold, if established, is not met.
         18.11.1.5.4. Assign a technical rating inspection as acceptable when the total number
         of minor discrepancies does not exceed the applicable baseline or AQL contained in
         the quality control/assurance requirements of the contract.
         18.11.1.5.5. QAEs at units operating from a contract Section C requirements
         document with a Service Delivery Summary (SDS) will ensure that applicable
         standards identified in the SDS are considered during the development of technical
         inspection requirements.
  18.11.2. Follow-up technical inspections. Follow-up technical inspections are inspections
  accomplished that follow behind the contractor’s QC for the purpose of verifying the
  contractor’s quality program. All units, to include CLS contracts, will identify select
  technical inspections contained in their PP. The chief QAE schedules a sufficient percentage
  of technical inspections as follow-up technical inspections. These inspections may be
  performed in conjunction with other inspection requirements. If this option is used,
  document each inspection separately.
      18.11.2.1. As with technical inspections, follow-up technical inspections may also be
      performed concurrently or after contractor QC inspections. Include these requirements in
      the PP and the monthly surveillance schedule. NOTE: The chief QAE may elect to do
      QC follow-up inspection on observation work areas as well.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                           333


       18.11.2.2. Follow-up technical inspection ratings. Follow-up technical inspections will
       be rated the same as technical inspections.
   18.11.3. Observation area inspections. Observation area inspections are similar to IG
   inspections, where QAEs assess work center’s/areas ability to manage program areas they are
   contractually responsible for. Minimum observation work area surveillance requirements
   will be determined by each MAJCOM.
   18.11.4. Safety. Document violations of Occupational Safety and Health Administration
   (OSHA) or Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standards (AFOSHSTDs) that clearly
   present a potential to damage or injure government resources as part of the inspection being
   performed or, if appropriate, "as observed." The documentation should clearly indicate the
   potential to damage or injure government resources. QAEs do not document violations of
   OSHA or AFOSHSTDs that do not present the potential to damage or injure government
   resources; rather they will informally notify the site supervisor and PCO/ACO.
   18.11.5. Documentation File Inspections. Rate documentation file inspections for aircraft,
   support equipment, and engines. The inspections include review of the status and historical
   documents (include documents in the MIS). Send discrepancies found in the historical
   documents file to the contractor for corrective action. Actual discrepancies are not corrected
   except for items of a historical nature, including automated documents that can be verified
   from other sources. Specifically:
       18.11.5.1. Each incorrect clearing of a Red X symbol, erasures of symbols, overdue
       Time Change Items (TCIs), and overdue inspections caused by improper documentation
       are considered major discrepancies. The correct use and clearance of Red X symbols are
       items of special attention during documentation file inspections. QAEs must ensure
       unsafe or unfit for operation conditions are represented by Red X entries and these entries
       are properly cleared.
18.12. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Pilot Responsibilities. FCF pilots assigned to the QAE
activity may assist the FC/FD and chief QAE as necessary. Additionally, FCF pilots after
completing QAE training requirements may perform no-notice installed engine operation
inspections and training IAW AFI 21-101. FCF pilots will inform the chief QAE of problems or
adverse trends in contractor performance Noted when performing FCFs.
18.13. Documenting/correcting contractor performance. QAE technical, observation area, or
as observed inspections will be documented using applicable AF IMTs/forms or electronic
equivalent. Document any discrepancies as soon as they are discovered, and notify the
contractor as soon as the surveillance is completed. After the surveillance form is completed,
QAEs must also request a contractor representative to initial the document on which the
inspection is recorded to acknowledge receipt of performance assessment results and not
necessarily concurrence with the findings. If the contractor representative refuses to initial, it is
so Noted by the QAE. A date and time the discrepancy is discovered is also annotated, and the
contract representative is asked to correct the problem. Document and bring to the attention of
the contractor errors found in services not scheduled for observation, but do not use unscheduled
or as observed inspections to determine performance acceptability for the contractors monthly
rating.
 334                                             AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013


18.14. End of month surveillance summary. At the end of each month the chief QAE
compiles a monthly summary of all QAE surveillance activities for the month. The content,
format and routing of the end of month surveillance summary will be determined by each
MAJCOM.
18.15. Contractor non-conformance. If at any time during the surveillance rating period
(typically monthly or quarterly as specified by the contract Section C requirements document),
the results of surveillance required by the PP show that the number of unacceptable observations
do not meet contract standards or performance requirements, and the chief QAE determines it is
not government caused, the QAE organization initiates a corrective action request specified by
the applicable contract or a form specified by the MAJCOM.
   18.15.1. Forward the completed report to the PCO/ACO for evaluation. If the PCO/ACO
   determines it is appropriate, send the report to the contractor, with return receipt requested.
   The contractor normally has 15 calendar days from date of receipt to return the report to the
   PCO/ACO with a response as to cause, corrective action, and actions taken to prevent
   recurrence. The PCO/ACO, in consultation with the QAE, evaluates the contractor's
   response and takes appropriate action.
   18.15.2. If the contractor’s actions cited by the contractor in their response to the report fail
   to correct the area of non-conformance, the chief QAE ensures another corrective action
   request is initiated for any subsequent surveillance rating periods in the same non-
   conforming area.
   18.15.3. If any areas of non-conformance are not corrected using previous guidance, it is the
   responsibility of the FC/FD to contact the PCO/ACO or government program office to
   initiate discussion with corporate headquarters or issue a cure notice. In extreme
   circumstances a show cause notice or a contract termination notice may be required as
   determined by the FC/FD and PCO.
18.16. Past Performance Reporting. QAE organizations in coordination with the FC/FD and
PCO/ACO will accomplish annual contractor performance reporting using the Contractor
Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) as identified in the June 2007 AF CPARS
guide. For more information: http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/cparsfiles/cpars/refmatl.htm.
18.17. Acceptance of services will be accomplished utilizing DD Form 250 or the Wide
Area Work Flow system (WAWF). It is the chief QAE’s responsibility to validate the
accuracy of financial figures submitted by the contractor prior to the government paying for
services.
18.18. Award fee administration. Award fee management procedures will be determined by
the applicable contract award fee evaluation plan or MAJCOM determined procedures.
18.19. Transition administration (FAR Part 49). During the transition period of a contract,
the QAE organization is responsible to ensure the contractor meets all criteria outlined in the
contractor proposed transition plan.

Crosstells—Cross-tells are used to highlight trends, benchmarks or safety conditions relating to
maintenance equipment, personnel, training or processes. A crosstell is initiated to assist other
maintenance or logistics personnel with similar equipment to do their jobs more safely and/or
efficiently. Typically a crosstell will be initiated when a condition or trend is discovered
regarding (but not limited to) a weapon system or common components that should be shared
with other users or potential users. This information should be transmitted using signed and
encrypted email to ensure widest dissemination and ensure it is brought to the attention of unit
commanders in order to prevent or mitigate mishaps, injury or damage to AF personnel,
equipment or property. Typically crosstells will provide relevant background information and
history and can include such information as NSNs, part numbers, specific location of problem
areas, etc.
Customer Wait Time (CWT)—CWT for LRUs is the total elapsed time between the issuance
of a customer order and satisfaction of that order, regardless of source (immediate issues or

1.3.1. The MRT is required to call the home station MOC upon arrival to provide a phone
number where they can be contacted.
1.3.2. The MRT is responsible for their equipment and parts:
1.3.2.1. Verify necessary parts are available. Open each container to ensure the right
part(s) are in the box prior to departure.
1.3.2.2. Check special tools, support and test equipment for serviceability prior to departure.
1.4. Ensure TDY orders are generated for MRT. Consider the following authorizations and
provide as required:
1.4.1. Mission Route Support (MRS) or Mission Essential Personnel (MEP).
1.4.1.1. MRS permits the bumping of cargo to allow space for the MRT and their equipment.
1.4.2. Advance per diem.
1.4.3. Commercial travel.
1.4.4. Rental car.
1.4.5. Variations:
1.5. Direct the responsible shop to order the required parts and the applicable unit to select the
required equipment items. If requirements are not known, make contact with the AC/flight
engineer/ crew chief to determine what items are required.
1.5.1. Items too large or heavy to be carried will be coordinated with Lead Command and
processed by the responsible shop and given to the TMF for shipment.
1.5.2. If parts cannot be sourced locally, consider directing cannibalization.
1.6. Commercial transportation of a MRT and equipment is, in many cases, the most expeditious
method. Consider the following:
1.6.1. Airline:
1.6.2. Surface (bus, rail, and limousine).
1.6.3. Air Express Small Package Service.
AFI21-101_NASICSUP_I 12 September 2013                                                      381


1.7. Coordinate transportation requirements with TMF. Review the following:
1.7.1. Destination, and priority.
1.7.2. Selected mode of transportation and itinerary.
1.7.3. Names for MRT personnel and nomenclature of equipment items and parts.
1.7.4. Authorization for excess baggage allowance if necessary.
1.7.4. Record TCNs, government bills of lading (GBL), and any applicable billing or shipment
numbers.
Note: Shipment of large or heavy items by commercial airline mandates prior coordination with
airline personnel by MOC or the MRT. To maintain control of parts/equipment, they must be
hand-carried or checked as baggage. If an item is not accepted as carry-on luggage or checked as
baggage, purchase of an extra seat to accommodate it must be considered and is recommended.
Advance coordination with the airline is the key to a successful movement without unnecessary
delays.
1.8. Maintain contact with the MRT or the unit responsible for the parts/equipment shipment to
ensure that all resources arrive in time to make the scheduled departure.
