(AF/JA). Original or certified copies of agreements must arrive at DOS within 20 calendar days
after the date they are signed.

the terms of an international agreement. They will forward unresolved questions to the Deputy

(AF/JAO).

4. This section implements DoD Directive 5530.3 and the Case-Zablocki Act, Title 1 United

contact for US contracting officers and foreign tax relief program activities.

7.3. In countries where the commander of an Air Force unit or organization is not the
Designated Military Commander for tax matters, the appropriate Air Force overseas major
command (MAJCOM) commander will appoint an Air Force Liaison Officer for tax matters.

country representative.

11.2. Local staff judge advocates (SJA) will promptly notify Air Force members facing criminal
