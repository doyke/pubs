                                           Chapter 2

                                           POLICIES

2.1. Clearance and Sensitive Position Standard. The personnel security standard that must be
applied to determine whether a person is eligible for access to classified information or
assignment to sensitive duties is whether, based on all available information, the person’s
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that entrusting the person with classified
information or assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interest of
national security.
2.2. Military Service Standard. See AFPD 36-29, Military Standards and AFPD 36-20,
Accession of Air Force Military Personnel. It provides policies to ensure the Air Force employs
the right quantity and quality of people in the Air Force.
2.3. Criteria for Application of Security Standards. The criteria for determining eligibility
for a security clearance are listed in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200. Commanders apply the criteria
for security standards when granting access to classified information.
2.4. Types and Scope of Personnel Security Investigations. The scope of each type of
personnel security investigation is listed in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix B. See Attachment 2 for
procedures on requesting personnel security investigations (PSI). See Attachment 3 for
guidance on the types of required personnel security investigations and appropriate questionnaire
forms and or Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) Software.

   are conducted by OPM and are required on all civilian employees entering government
   employment and assigned to nonsensitive positions.
   2.4.5. Access National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check (ANACI).
   ANACIs are conducted by OPM and are required for civilian employees’ initial Secret
   security clearance or assignment to noncritical sensitive positions.
   2.4.5. (AFSPC) Access National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check
   (ANACI) is required for all civilian employees assigned to noncritical sensitive positions.

   for personnel assigned to these positions. EXCEPTION: Single Scope Background
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                     11


   Investigations (SSBI) are sufficient in scope for civilians assigned to noncritical sensitive
   positions, provided there has been no break in service greater than 24-months.
   2.4.6. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit Check (NACLC).
   NACLCs are required for military access to Secret information.
   2.4.7. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI). SSBIs are required for access to TOP

2.6. Allegations of Criminal Activity. Commanders refer possible criminal conduct to the
supporting Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) detachment.
2.7. Overseas Personnel Security Investigations. AFOSI personnel conduct the overseas
portion of personnel security investigations, augmented by Army, Navy, and State Department
counterparts.
2.8. Limitations and Restrictions. A break in service of over 24 months invalidates an
individual’s personnel security clearance eligibility.
 12                                      AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


                                            Chapter 3

                                  SECURITY CLEARANCE

3.1. Authority to Designate Sensitive Positions. Commanders with position designation
authority determine the security sensitivity of civilian positions. Each civilian employee is
subject to an investigation depending on the sensitivity of the position to be occupied, except for
reappointment when the break in employment is less than 24 months.
3.2. Nonsensitive Positions.
   3.2.1. The servicing civilian personnel flight (CPF) processes the initial request for NACIC’s
   to OPM for civilians occupying nonsensitive positions, not requiring access to classified
   information. OPM forwards the investigation to the CAF. Suitability determinations for
   civilian government employment are made accordingly:
   3.2.2. The CAF forwards the completed investigation, OPM ―Certificate of Investigation‖
   and the OPM INV Form 79A, Report of Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel
   Investigations to the base servicing CPF.
   3.2.3. The CPF:
       3.2.3.1. Determines if the individual is deemed suitable for employment IAW 5 CFR
       731.201-202. Coordination and or consultation with the supervisor and or commander
       may be made.
       3.2.3.2. If employee is determined suitable, CPF signs off on the OPM Certificate of
       Investigation and the form is filed in the individual’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF)
       IAW AFI 36.114, Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
       3.2.3.3. If applicant is determined unsuitable, CPF fills out the OPM INV Form 79A,
       Report of Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel Investigations and coordinates
       with the employee’s supervisor and or commander. CPF forwards the OPM INV Form
       79A to OPM.
3.3. Reassignment to a Noncritical Sensitive Position. If a civilian employee is subsequently
selected for a position requiring access to classified information and unescorted entry into
restricted areas (noncritical sensitive), security managers process the completed SF 86,
Questionnaire for National Security Positions, to security forces authorized requesters.
   3.3.1. Security Forces Authorized Requesters:
       3.3.1.1. Submit the SF 86 to OPM for an ―Access NACI‖. The address is: OPM-FIPC
       PO Box 618, 1137 Branchton Road, Boyers, PA, 16018. OPM does not have the EPSQ,
       therefore requests must be sent in hard copy. Use the EPSQ at the unit, validate the
       EPSQ, and print the SF 86 for mailing. Contact the servicing CPF for any questions
       concerning Part 1 of the SF 86 or the OPM Agency Use Information Sheet. A fingerprint
       card is not required as the individual has already been the subject of a NACI or NACIC.
3.4. Reassignment to a Critical Sensitive Position. If, in the future, the individual is selected
for a critical sensitive position, security managers process the request for investigation to the
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                       13


security forces authorized requester who will submit an SF 86 requesting a SSBI in accordance
with Attachment 2.
3.5. PRs for Critical Sensitive and Noncritical Sensitive Positions. The periodic
reinvestigation requirements apply to civilian employees in noncritical sensitive positions that
require access to classified information. The reinvestigation requirements apply to civilian
employees in critical sensitive positions whether or not they have access to classified
information. See Attachment 3.
3.5. (AFSPC)PRs for Critical and Noncritical Sensitive Positions. The periodic
reinvestigation (PR) requirements apply to all civilian employees in noncritical sensitive
positions, whether or not they have access to classified material.
3.6. Pre-employment Waivers.
   3.6.1. Sensitive Positions. Commanders must ensure procedures for pre-appointment to
   sensitive positions preclude an uncleared person from having access to classified
   information.
   3.6.2. Noncritical Sensitive and Critical Sensitive Positions (3-204). The commander or staff
   agency chief (or designee) with position sensitivity determination authority prepares a waiver
   of preemployment investigation requirements when such action is necessary and in the
   national interest. See Attachment 6 for sample waiver memorandum. The memorandum is
   filed in the individual’s OPF IAW AFI 36-114, Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
       3.6.2.1. (Added-SMC) ASPM/USM will monitor JPAS for personnel with pre-
       employment waivers and will process the documentation for an interim clearance as soon
       as subject is eligible and meets requirements. See Attachment 27 for interim clearance
       template.
3.7. Mobilization of DOD Civilian Retirees. MAJCOM commanders can waive the
investigative requirements for the mobilization of selected re-employed annuitants for temporary
appointment when the break in employment is greater than 24 months.
3.8. Military Appointment, Enlistment, and Induction. Personnel appointed, enlisted, or
inducted to the active or reserve forces of the Air Force must have a favorable personnel security
investigation. See Attachment 3.
   3.8.1. Clearance requirements for officer training school selectees are outlined in Air Force
   Instruction (AFI)362005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and
   Assignment in Professional Categories.
3.9. Mobilization of Military Retirees. MAJCOM commanders can waive the requirement for
a full NACLC for the mobilization of military retirees upon reentry to active duty after a break of
more than 24 months.
3.10. Security Clearance Authority. The 497 Intelligence Group/INS, Directorate of Security
and Communications Management, the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility, is the designated
authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel security clearances and SCI access (see

Equipment Not Involving Access to Classified Information. Access for unescorted entry may
be granted based on the following investigative requirements. Refer to Attachment 3, Table
A3.6.
   3.24.1. DOD and OPM civilians require a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries
   and Credit Check (NACIC).
   3.24.2. Air Reserve forces personnel with a current Entrance National Agency Check
   (ENTNAC) or NAC may have unescorted entry to restricted areas while in civilian status,
   pending completion of the required NACIC.
   3.24.3. Department of Energy employees require an ―L‖ (Secret) clearance.
   3.24.4. Federal employees require a NAC.

   Discharge and no break in service greater than 24 months, may use a previously completed
   ENTNAC or NACLC.
   3.24.6. Contractor employees require a NAC. Contractors operating as visitor groups only
   (contract performance exceeding 90 consecutive days), have the following option.
   Commanders may grant individuals access to restricted areas subject to: (1) the contractor
   completing the SF 85P and it is submitted to OPM for a NAC; (2) a check of the Defense
   Clearance and Investigations Index reveals no relevant, significant information which might
   preclude unescorted access; and (3) a check of appropriate local records.
   3.24.7. Commanders may waive on a case by case basis, the investigative requirements for
   unescorted entry to restricted areas containing PL2 and or 3 resources pending completion of
   a favorable NAC, or NACIC after favorable review of the completed personnel security
   questionnaire for the investigation. Decisions to deny or withdraw must be fully supported by
   the documented facts. Individuals must be informed of the adverse information about them
   (unless precluded by security considerations) and given the opportunity to appear before the
   commander. This allows the individual to refute or to mitigate the information. Forward
   appeals of denials or withdrawals to the MAJCOM commander or designee.

   resources, and a local agency check for restricted areas containing PL3 resources.
   3.24.10. Unit commanders through the installation commander, request NACs on contractor
   employees requiring unescorted entry to restricted areas. The CAF adjudicates the completed
   NAC and enters the results in the appropriate database. Installation commanders approve all
   denials or withdrawals of unescorted entry for contractor employees.
3.25. Nonappropriated Fund Employees. Human Resources Office (HRO) managers
(Attachment 4) designate positions of trust. AFPD 34-3, Nonappropriated Funds Personnel

5200.2-R, appendix K for ADP definitions.
   3.27.1. See Attachment 3 for AIS I, II, and III investigation requirements. See paragraph
   3.11 for interim security clearance requirements.
   3.27.2. The CAF provides the results of the investigations for AIS I, II, and III purposes to
   the authorized requester for the commander’s suitability determination according to the
   suitability criteria outlined in 5 CFR 731.201-202. The CAF does not review the
   investigation for security clearance purposes.
   3.27.3. Commanders may recommend to the Designated Approving Authority (DAA) that
   interim AIS access be granted. Commanders may waive, on a case by case basis, the
   investigative requirements for access to AIS pending completion of a favorable ENTNAC,
   NAC, NACIC, ANACI, or SSBI, after favorable review of the completed personnel security
   questionnaire for the investigation. Commanders confirm that the following actions have
   been accomplished prior to access:
       3.27.3.1. Mandatory information assurance training has been given and documentation
       by a supervisor accompanies the request.
       3.27.3.2. Systems Administrators have implemented measures to limit access to the

                REQUESTING PERSONNEL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. Security Managers provide personnel security support to active duty military, civilian,
   and guard and reserve members assigned or attached to the active duty organization.
   5.1.1. (AFSPC) Security managers will also support contractors requiring favorable
   background investigations for contract performance.
       5.1.1.1. Submit completed personnel security questionnaires to supporting authorized
       requester. See Attachment 3 for additional guidance.
       5.1.1.2. (Added-SMC) ASPM/USM will review a copy of subject’s PSI package
       completed in e-QIP for completeness and accuracy prior to subject certifying and
       releasing to SMC/PIP
5.2. Authorized Requesters.
   5.2.1. MAJCOM, field operating agency (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) staffs
   designate authorized requesters to initiate PSIs for their organization. As a general rule, the
   number of authorized requesters will be kept to the minimum number required to meet
   mission requirements. See Attachment 2 for request procedures.
   5.2.2. Authorized requesters provide the AFCAF with the name, telephone number, and
   office symbol of individual(s) who may obtain security clearance and or investigative data on
   individuals within their organization and provide copy to respective MAJCOM. See para 6.1
   for AFCAF address.
   5.2.2. (AFSPC) SSAs will forward all additions (include name, rank, Social Security
   number, DSN number, and office symbol) and deletions for authorized callers to HQ
   AFSPC/A7SC. HQ AFSPC/A7SC will provide the authorized caller list to the AFCAF.
       5.2.2.1. (Added-SMC) With the exceptions of SMC/IN for SCI issues, and the Office of
       Special Investigations (OSI), only SMC/PIP may conduct communications for security
       clearance information or security issues with Air Force Central Adjudication Facility

 28                                    AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


   5.5.1. PRP. In cases where a PRP ―C‖ coded case warrants ―Priority‖ service by OPM, the
   authorized requester must coordinate the request through channels to AF/XOS-FI. Each
   authorized requester will maintain a fiscal year (FY) Excel spreadsheet listing for this
   purpose. The spreadsheet will include all previously coordinated FY priority PSIs and all
   new requirements the authorized requester is coordinating under this authority. When
   coordinating new priority cases, forward the entire FY spreadsheet to
   afxofi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. AF/XOS-FI will return to the authorized requester for
   monitoring the completion of the investigation.
   5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4, Annex A,
   para 5), the servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO a copy of the
   completed SF 86 for each SSBI request with an SCI access requirement. This will be done at
   the same time the request for SSBI/SCI is forwarded to OPM. Security
   Managers/SSOs/Authorized Requesters will expedite the processing of the SSBI off the
   installation to OPM and request priority level of service. On the OPM Agency Use Sheet
   annotate 30A in Block A. Also see AFMAN 14-304.
5.6. Personal Data Provided by the Subject of the Investigation.
   5.6.1. The Air Force goal for processing personnel security investigation requests at base
   level is 14 duty days. However, commands that have extensive deployments and TDY
   requirements may establish their own internal management controls and or timelines for the
   processing of investigation requests.
   5.6.2. The subject of the investigation will provide the required documentation to the
   security manager to verify birth and education information. See Attachment 2 for details.
       5.6.2.1. (Added-SMC) For Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) PSI
       submittals, ASPM/USM will verify the person’s US citizenship (US birth certificate, US
       Naturalization Certificate or US passport). ASPM/USM will annotate verification of US
       citizenship in Part VII ―Remarks‖ section of AF IMT 2583 (Request for Personnel
       Security Action).
       5.6.2.2. (Added-SMC) 61 Medical Group Mental Health and Public Health offices, will
       perform the medical review on military members only. Active Duty Air Force and
       Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) members must schedule an appointment with
       the Mental Health office for a security clearance processing review.
   5.6.3. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA): Upon accession, IMAs complete the PSI
   during the first three days of the individual duty training (IDT) period or not later than 90
   days at the unit of assignment or attachment and turn-in to the servicing security manager
   and or gaining active duty security manager.
   5.6.4. See Chapter 8 for actions when individuals refuse to provide the required information
   for a personnel security investigation.
   5.6.5. DSS and OPM are the DOD repository of personnel security investigative files. To
   obtain a personal copy of an investigation, forward a notarized request that includes: name,
   SSAN, date of birth, and place of birth to: DSS, ATTN: Privacy Act Office, PO Box 46060,
   Baltimore, MD 212406060 or OPM, ATTN: FOIA, PO Box 618, 1137 Branchton Rd,
   Boyers, PA 16018-0618. The request should refer to the Privacy Act and include a valid
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                      29


   return address. All signatures must be notarized. Military personnel may use a commissioned
   officer in lieu of a notary public to attest to the signature. Identify the SSN and rank of the
   officer. Also refer to AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program.
5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD civilian,
contractor, or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation and they are a dual
citizen and/or possess/use a foreign passport.
5.7. (AFSPC)Dual Citizenship. Interim security clearances will not be granted to dual citizens
until the provisions of the basic instruction have been met.
   5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic disqualifier for
   security clearance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship and particularly the
   exercise of dual citizenship is a condition that raises a security concern and may be a
   disqualifying factor in a security clearance eligibility determination. There are factors that
   could mitigate the maintenance of dual citizenship, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, App I,
   Foreign Preference. An individual’s expressed willingness to renounce dual citizenship is one
   of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
   5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport in
   preference to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s allegiance to the US is
   paramount and could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the US. The security
   clearance will be denied or revoked, unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or
   obtains official approval for its use from SAF/AA. Requests for approval are forwarded
   through respective Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) channels to HQ
   USAF/XOS-FI for processing to SAF/AA. Justification must include what benefit the AF
   will gain from a person holding a foreign passport. AFCAF will annotate approvals in the
   remarks field of the JPAS.
   5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign passport in
   item 15 of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on the Standard Form
   86, ―Questionnaire for National Security Positions,‖ will be required to surrender the
   passport via one of the following methods:
       5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate via certified
       receipt mail. A copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and the return
       receipt will be forwarded to the AFCAF. See para 6.1 for AFCAF address. If the name
       of adjudicator assigned to the case is known, include this in the ATTN line of the address.
       5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the
       passport and place in a burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the
       destruction of the passport in an explanatory memorandum, which will be forwarded to
       the AFCAF and a copy provided to the subject.
   5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign passport and
   dual citizenship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance eligibility the
   following must be completed:
       5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign
       citizenship claims in favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual
       renouncement is not required.
30                                    AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


     5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.
  5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport must be
  provided to the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to determine
  security clearance eligibility.
  5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security clearance
  determination is made.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                     31

                                      ADJUDICATION

6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF)
is the Central Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229 Brookely Ave, Bolling
AFB 20032.
   6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200, 6-102
   and Appendix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for a security
   clearance or assignment to sensitive duties.
   6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility (see
   Chapter 8).
   6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility
   determination.
   6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring customers
   on pending investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory issues are often
   resolved through completion of the investigation and or adjudication of the case. Premature
   dissemination of unresolved and or un-adjudicated issues could result in discriminatory
   practices with respect to such areas as employments or assignments.
6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the JPAS. JPAS
replaced Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.

                   ISSUING CLEARANCE AND GRANTING ACCESS

7.1. General
   7.1.1. The AFCAF is the designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel
   security clearances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).
   7.1.2. Position Designations (7-100c). Commanders:
      7.1.2.1. Determine the level of access necessary for each military and civilian position
      based on mission needs. Each position is coded with the appropriate security access
      requirement (SAR) and identified in the unit manning document (UMD), the Defense
      Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), and SK. See Attachment 3, for SAR code
      definitions. If the SAR code requires a change, the unit commander submits an
      authorization change request to the servicing security activity.
      7.1.2.1. (AFSPC) The SSA will forward the change request to the servicing manpower
      office.
      7.1.2.2. Conduct a review annually to determine the accuracy of position coding,
      eliminate unnecessary access codings, and adjust SAR code appropriately.
      7.1.2.3. Record findings in the UMD and SK.
      7.1.2.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential
      needs.
7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
   7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each military
   and civilian position in the organization. Investigations are required for multiple purposes: to
   determine suitability and/or trustworthiness of individual for employment/assignment to
   positions of trust/access to certain programs; and for security clearance. Each position is
   coded with the appropriate position code reflecting the required investigation level in the unit
   manning document (UMD) and the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).
   These will also be reflected in the Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data System (HAF-
   MDS).
      7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:
          7.2.1.1.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
          7.2.1.1.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).
          7.2.1.1.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI).
          7.2.1.1.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI).
          7.2.1.1.5. National Agency Check (NAC).
      7.2.1.2. The definitions and corresponding codes are located in Attachment 22, Table
      A22.1.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                      33


       7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last
       AF-wide directed review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each
       May. Retain results for review during self inspections, etc.
          7.2.1.3.1. (Added-SMC) ASPM/USM will provide SMC/PIP’s Personnel Security
          Program Manager a Commander/Director signed letter with the results of the review
          NLT 31 May of each year.
       7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential
       needs.
       7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.
   7.2.2. Mandatory Secret or Top Secret requirement may be required when every position in a
   specialty is not coded as requiring access to classified information if the functional
   community can validate security access requirements for the AFSC and provide justification
   that demonstrates mandatory qualification required for mission accomplishment, such as
   access to classified information or equipment.
7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). HQ USAF/XOS-
FI approves requests for adding security clearances or investigations as AFSC prerequisites.
Requests are staffed through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification and
AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification will reflect an SSBI requirement for entry, award, and
retention for the respective mandatory AFSCs. See Attachment 22; Table A22.2, A22.3.
   7.3.1. Security clearance data can be verified by the CAVS, Permanent Change of Station
   Orders, or Temporary Duty Orders.
7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive
programs that have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e., Presidential Support,
Personnel Reliability Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table A22.4.
   7.4.1. AMS is the application used by the CAF and is restricted to CAF personnel only.
       7.4.1.1. It is a centralized database enabling CAF personnel to post adjudication results;
       security clearance determinations; access eligibility; pending actions; status of due
       process actions, i.e. security information files; statistical reporting requirements; and
       other personnel security management functions.
       7.4.1.2. Selected data fields from AMS will be available through CAVS to Air Force
       customers/users almost immediately after input by CAF personnel and within 24 hours of
       data input by other customers/users.
   7.4.2. CAVS is the application used by MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs, ISPMs, SSOs, unit level
   security managers, and other individuals with personnel/physical security responsibilities.
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs will determine those organizations and individuals within their
   organizations who will be given CAVS access. Clearance data elements in the CAVS include
   the full date and type of investigation and the full date and status of security clearance. The
   information is invalid when any of these four data elements are incomplete.
       7.4.2.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the CAVS when more
       than one entry appears for an individual.
34                                     AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


     7.4.2.2. An individual may have multiple SAR codes recorded in the CAVS if the
     individual is in multiple positions (i.e. civilian, reserve, or air national guard). The level
     of access given to the individual should be based on the access necessary for the position.
     Commanders make the decision on the level of access required.
     7.4.2.3. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the
     subject of a SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance, is eligible for SCI
     access if required for mission essential purposes (depending on the currency of the
     investigation) and or may already have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
     7.4.2.4. The CAVS will provide the following information:
        7.4.2.4.1. An individual’s security clearance level and access.
        7.4.2.4.2. Visit and suspension notifications.
        7.4.2.4.3. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates.
        7.4.2.4.4. Establishment of a SIF.
     7.4.2.5. Access to the CAVS is restricted to Air Force employees only. Contractors and
     others who are assigned to an ISPM or SSO office must have prior approval by the SK
     Program Management Office (497 IG/INSP (PMO)) for access.
     7.4.2.5. (AFSPC) Contractors providing collateral security support may be given level 7
     or level 10 Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) accounts. Access to levels 4, 5,
     or 6 will not be granted to contractors.
     7.4.2.6. There are 7 User Levels in the CAVS. These levels are defined as follows:
        7.4.2.6.1. Level 1: CAF personnel and Systems Administrators.
        7.4.2.6.2. Level 2: MAJCOM/FOA/DRU SCI security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.3. Level 3: Base SCI security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.4. Level 4: MAJCOM/FOA/DRU non-SCI security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.5. Level 5: Base ISPM security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.5. (AFSPC) SSAs submit access request forms for level 5/account manager
        access to HQ AFSPC/A7SC for approval. Geographically separated units (GSUs)
        will route their requests to their parent wing.
        7.4.2.6.6. Level 6: Entry Controller.
        7.4.2.6.7. Level 7: Unit Level Security Manager.
     7.4.2.7. User Levels have the following CAVS read and write access:
        7.4.2.7.1. User levels 2-7 have read access to all Air Force personnel.
        7.4.2.7.2. User levels 2 and 4 may write to records within their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
        PASCODE.
        7.4.2.7.3. User levels 3 and 5 may write to records within their local PASCODE and
        to records of individuals assigned to another MAJCOM/FOA/DRU supported by
        levels 3 and 5.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                       35


          7.4.2.7.4. User level 6, entry controller, has the ability to verify an individual’s
          clearance eligibility and access in the CAVS. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU may have reports
          printed for entry controllers by base ISPM security personnel (user level 5) listing the
          clearance eligibility and access of expected visitors. Reports will only be valid for the
          date and time printed.
          7.4.2.7.5. User level 7 has the ability to write non-SCI access (interim, secret, and top
          secret); nondisclosure dates; NATO access; and the indoctrination/debriefing dates.
          Level 7 is also authorized to view non-SCI access history and print reports associated
          with their write capabilities.
       7.4.2.8. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access level for each user within
       their command. The system administrator will establish user accounts. SK allows
       unlimited users on one computer, but each user must have an individual account. A user
       account must be restricted to the registered user only.
       7.4.2.9. User Levels 1-3 must have a Top Secret clearance based on an SSBI or PR. User
       Levels 4-7 require a Secret clearance based on an ENTNAC, NAC, NACLC, NACI,
       NACIC, or ANACI.
   7.4.3. The CAF will publish and keep current a SK training guide with instructions on the
   use of AMS and CAVS. The CAF will review/update the SK web page at least monthly, to
   provide additional guidance and references as needed.
   7.4.4. Requests for changes to SK must be forwarded by the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Security
   Forces or Special Security Office (SSO) to the SK Requirements Group through the 497
   IG/INSP, 229 Brookley Ave, Bolling AFB DC, 20332-7040.
   7.4.5. SK will be replaced with the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) which will
   be the DOD personnel security automated system that contains investigative and security
   clearance data.
7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or Contractual
Exigencies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for deployments will, as a
minimum, be assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret information for the in-country threat
briefing. SSBIs are not authorized for purposes of Top Secret eligibility ―just in case of‖
deployment. In these situations, commanders grant interim Top Secret access for a period of up
to 180 days. This can be renewed for extended deployment purposes and for redeployment.
Interim Top Secret access is granted for the purpose of deployment based on the existing
NACLC, and discontinued upon return to home station. SSBIs will not be required for this
purpose. Persons must be US citizens and have not had a break in service for more than 24
months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS or in cases where it is not available,
documented and maintained with security related documents. However, SSBI is authorized if a
joint or theater deployment requires a final Top Secret security clearance and will not accept
interims, i.e., JCS contingencies. These requirements need to be identified and positions coded
IAW para 7.2 of this instruction.
7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian Equivalent
authority is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before the servicing
Manpower Office codes the positions on the UMD. Approval authorized can not be delegated.
Approval authorities are as follows:
 36                                    AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


   7.6.1. MAJCOMs: CV or NAF/CC
       7.6.1.1. The authorized requester forwards a copy of the MFR to the individual's security
       manager.
       7.6.1.2. The authorized requester and the unit keep the MFR until the CAVS shows a
       final security clearance.
   7.6.2. FOAs: parent 2-Ltr or SAF/AA or AF/CVA if the parent 2-Ltr is not at the appropriate
   grade level.
   7.6.3. DRUs: AF/CVA.
   7.6.4. HQ USAF:
       7.6.4.1. Air Staff: AF/CVA
       7.6.4.2. Secretariate: SAF/AA
   7.6.5. Commands will establish internal certifying procedures. The approval documentation
   will be retained by the Manpower Office for three years and is subject to compliance review
   by HQ AFIA or their designee. Approval will increase MAJCOM funds withhold for
   personnel security investigations through the FYDP.
   7.6.5. (AFSPC) Additional/new/upgrade SSBI requests will be routed through the wing
   commander to the NAF/CC or SMC/CC. AFSPC/CV is the approval authority for
   headquarters elements. All requests must include detailed justification to ensure only those
   positions having a valid need-to-know are upgraded. Use the sample memorandum at
   Attachment 28 (Added). SSAs will maintain a copy of the approval until the investigation
   is adjudicated.
       7.6.5.1. (Added-SMC) Over-hires/Temporary positions are not coded with Security
       Access Requirements (SAR). In these cases, SMC/CC is the final approving authority
       for those requiring SSBI scope clearances. However, the following must occur to process
       an overhire/temporary position for an SSBI:
          7.6.5.1.1. (Added-SMC) Wing CC, through subject’s Position Description (PD)
          Core document, will verify the requirement for a SSBI.
          7.6.5.1.2. (Added-SMC) In a justification memorandum to SMC/CC,
          Commanders/Directors will state that all avenues to act in accordance with paragraph
          7.6 were exhausted, and no other method to meet SSBI requirements exists.
          7.6.5.1.3. (Added-SMC) Final SMC/CC approval and PD documentation will be
          provided to SMC/PIP by ASPM/USM with the e-QIP request.
7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for incumbents
assigned against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI. Also see para A2.7.
7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance eligibility and
enters the determination into JPAS.
7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of Defense
(DoD) personnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates personnel security
management for the DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF), security managers, and offers
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                       37


both non-SCI and SCI functions. It interfaces with the investigative providers, the personnel
systems within the Department thus eliminating manual transactions and expediting the flow of
personnel security information to warfighters.
   7.9.1. JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of investigations
   on individuals in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the CAFs and its
   customers. All information in JPAS is unclassified, but must be protected according to the
   requirements for privacy/sensitive information and For Official Use Only (FOUO) in
   accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program and DoDR 5400.7/AF
   Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program.
   7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) and
   Joint Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS)
       7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as case
       management/distribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and summary, due
       process, and future ability for each CAF to electronically access investigative reports
       from the investigative providers.
          7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used
          throughout this instruction.
       7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized
       requesters and provides capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history,
       incident/issue file reporting, history and management of unit personnel security functions.
          7.9.2.2.1. JCAVS replaced Clearance and Access Verification System (CAVS), as
          used throughout this instruction.
   7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user. Clearance
   data elements in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation and the full date
   and status of security clearance. The information is invalid when any of these four data
   elements are incomplete.
   7.9.3. (AFSPC) Collateral level (levels 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10) account management access is
   restricted to HQ AFSPC/A7SC and SSA staff members. The SSA will designate account
   managers to HQ AFSPC/A7SC. SSAs will maintain a signed access request form for each
   user for the life of the account and will conduct an annual review of all subordinate accounts
   to ensure all accounts are valid. JPAS users found abusing their JPAS access (i.e. account
   sharing, use for other than government purposes, failing to protect information in accordance
   with the Privacy Act of 1974, or any other actions deemed inappropriate) will have their
   access removed. The installation commander must approve request for reinstatement.
       7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when more
       than one entry appears for an individual.
       7.9.3.2. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the
       subject of a SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is eligible
       for SCI access if required for mission essential purposes and may already have SCI
       access. See AFMAN 14-304.
   7.9.4. The JCAVS will provide the following information:
38                                       AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011

7.10. AF JPAS Users Guide. Contains detailed instructions on operating JPAS and becoming a
new             user.             See               the            follow            URL:
https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/Organization/AFXOF/XOF%20memo%2012%20Jul
%2004%20AF%20JPAS%20Guide1.pdf. JPAS web site is: https://jpas.osd.mil. Requests for
changes to JPAS may be made on-line at https://jpas.osd.mil.
7.11. Granting Access. Commanders grant access to classified information when a mission
essential need exists and only when all of the following prerequisites are met: (1) individual has
the appropriate security clearance eligibility; (2) individual has signed an SF 312 (see AFI 31-
401); and (3) individual has a need-to-know. Authorized base level users will record access in
the JCAVS. See Chapter 3 for other situations when access to classified information may be
granted.
7.12. Obtaining Information from the AFCAF.
   7.12.1. Authorized requesters may contact the AFCAF Customer Support Section through
   JPAS. In situations where no security clearance data is available at the unit, no information is
   available in the JCAVS, and the AFCAF has valid security clearance information on file, a
   record of the call will be used as evidence of valid clearance data pending update of the
   JCAVS. The authorized requester prepares a memorandum for record (MFR) showing: (1)
   name, grade, and organization of the individual calling the AFCAF; (2) name, grade,
40                                   AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011

                                           Chapter 8

                     UNFAVORABLE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

8.1. Referral for Action.
   8.1.1. Security Information File (SIF). A SIF is a collection of documents generated as a
   result of the discovery or development of unfavorable information which brings into question
   a person’s continuing eligibility for a security clearance or access to SCI. It may be
   established by a commander, civilian equivalent, or by the CAF. The SIF serves as a
   repository for unfavorable or derogatory information that requires further review, evaluation,
   or investigation to resolve outstanding administrative or adjudicative concerns. Report
   administrative change of status information for individuals with SCI access according to
   AFMAN 14-304.
   8.1.2. Reporting Government Charge Card Abuses and Misuse. Security Officials, AFOSI,
   or AF Government Charge Card program coordinators are required to immediately report
   Government Charge Card abuses and misuses to the appropriate commander. This
   information constitutes serious questions as to the individual’s ability or intent to protect
   classified information or execute sensitive duties. The commander will make an immediate
   determination to either leave the individual’s security status unchanged or suspend their
   access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties until the appropriate
   authority makes a final determination regarding the individual’s eligibility to retain a security
   clearance. In addition, commanders may take action in accordance with Chapter 8, to
   determine if a SIF should be established and/or the person’s access to classified information
   should be suspended.
   8.1.3. Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances as
   Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001
   – Smith Amendment. Attachment 24 outlines the instructions.
8.2. Suspension.
   8.2.1. Commander:
       8.2.1.1. Reviews unfavorable information on individuals under the commander’s
       jurisdiction when reported or developed which would directly impact an individual’s
       security clearance or SCI access, to include the following (see Attachment 11 for sample
       memorandum):
          8.2.1.1.1. Activities’ tenant or geographically separated units.
          8.2.1.1.2. TDY personnel.
       8.2.1.2. Establishes a SIF when an individual’s activity, conduct or behavior is
       inconsistent with the security criteria specified in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200 and
       Appendix I. See Attachment 12 for sample request for SIF establishment to the servicing
       security activity.
          8.2.1.2.1. (Added-SMC) SMC/PIP will be included on distribution for the 61
          Security Forces Squadron LAAFB blotter.
42                                    AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


     8.2.1.3. Determines whether or not to establish a SIF on a case by case basis, normally
     within 20 days of receipt of unfavorable information (as soon as possible if SCI access is
     involved). This decision is made by considering the seriousness of the incident; the
     individual’s motivation; whether it was out of character for the individual; or whether the
     undesirable conduct or behavior is likely to continue. Coordination and consultation with
     the chief of the servicing security activity, SSO (for SCI access) or program security
     officer (for SAP access) and legal representatives is recommended. However, if the
     commander has sufficient reason to doubt the validity of unfavorable information the
     decision to establish a SIF and notification to the CAF may be extended up to 45 days. If
     the servicing security activity and the commander disagree on establishment of a SIF,
     elevate the issue to the installation commander for resolution. Once a SIF is formally
     established it must be processed accordingly and only the CAF has closure authority.
        8.2.1.3.1. Examples of reasons to establish a SIF are outlined in para 2-200, DOD
        5200.2-R and include the following:
            8.2.1.3.1.1. Refusal to sign a required SF 312 or other nondisclosure agreement.
            8.2.1.3.1.2. Refusal or intentional failure of an individual requiring an
            investigation or periodic reinvestigation to provide the personnel security
            questionnaire information or release statements for review of medical, financial,
            or employment records.
            8.2.1.3.1.2. (AFSPC) SSAs will recommend establishing a security information
            file (SIF) with access suspension for personnel who fail to submit their periodic
            reinvestigation on time. Top Secret PRs are considered to be overdue 5 years and
            1 day after the previous investigation closed. Secret PRs are considered to be
            overdue 10 years and 1 day after the previous investigation closed.
            8.2.1.3.1.3. Refusal by an individual to be interviewed in connection with a
            personnel security investigation, regardless of whether the information is
            requested by the investigative agency or the CAF.
            8.2.1.3.1.4. Incidents of theft, embezzlement, child or spouse abuse, unauthorized
            sale or use of firearms, explosives, or dangerous weapons, or misuse or improper
            disposition of government property or other unlawful activities.
            8.2.1.3.1.5. Information leading to permanent decertification from PRP for other
            than physical reasons.
        8.2.1.3.2. The following are some examples of reasons that may not warrant
        establishment of a SIF:
            8.2.1.3.2.1. Minor traffic violations.
            8.2.1.3.2.2. Minor one-time alcohol related incident.
            8.2.1.3.2.3. Permanent decertification from PRP related to medical reasons of a
            physical nature.
            8.2.1.3.2.4. Disciplinary issues; such as failure to repair; poor duty performance;
            failure to maintain weight standards; and any single isolated incident of poor
            judgment based on immaturity or extenuating circumstances which does not
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                    43


            impact on the individual’s ability to safeguard classified information.
            8.2.1.3.2.5. Federal civilian employees occupying nonsensitive positions.
            8.2.1.3.2.6. Incidents where a SIF has already been established by the CAF based
            on the same unfavorable information.
     8.2.1.4. Determines whether or not to initiate suspension action for the individual’s
     access to classified information upon establishment of a SIF. If the decision is to suspend
     the person’s access to classified information the same decision automatically applies to
     the SCI and SAP access. The access to classified information and SCI is considered one
     under the new DOD personnel security common adjudicative guidelines. Additionally,
     the commander determines suspension of unescorted entry to restricted areas if
     applicable. The determination to suspend should be based on a thorough review of the
     facts and an assessment of the risk to national security. For SCI access see AFMAN 14-
     304 and DOD S-5105.21-M-1, Sensitive Compartmented Information Administrative
     Manual.
         8.2.1.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) If access is suspended, an AF IMT 2587 must be
         accomplished and included in the SIF.
     8.2.1.5. Notifies the individual accordingly with information copy to the servicing
     security activity. See Attachment 13 and Attachment 14 for sample memorandums.
     8.2.1.6. Requests AFOSI investigation, if criminal activity is involved.
     8.2.1.7. Includes a recommendation whether to grant, reinstate, deny, or revoke the
     individual’s security clearance and or SCI/SAP access and the rationale for the decision
     in the completed SIF. The documented facts must fully support the recommendation.
     Refer to DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix I, Adjudicative Guidelines.
     8.2.1.8. Requests the CAF to immediately close a SIF favorably via priority message
     (through the MAJCOM or activity SSO for SCI) when special circumstances exist (i.e.,
     individual was falsely accused or holds a special expertise that is essential for mission
     accomplishment). The commander provides the CAF with the SIF (if not already at the
     CAF) and full justification for favorable closure. The CAF will then make the security
     clearance determination or request additional information, if necessary.
     8.2.1.9. Endorses requests by Chief of Servicing Security Activity (SF), SSO, and
     Program Security Officer (PSO) for evaluations and relevant documentation from on base
     activities when issues warrant such coordination.
  8.2.2. Chief of Servicing Security Activity, SSO, and PSO:
     8.2.2.1. Provides guidance to commanders on SIF establishment. SF is OPR for Top
     Secret and Secret security clearance SIFs; SSO is OPR for SCI access SIFs.
         8.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) A personnel security representative from the SSA will
         attend the installation ―Cops and Robbers‖ (or equivalent) meeting.       The
         representative will take appropriate personnel security action (see paragraph
         8.2.2.1.2) based on information discovered during the meeting.
         8.2.2.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) When the SSA becomes aware of potentially derogatory
         information, the SSA will use the sample memorandum at Attachment 11 of the basic
44                                    AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


        instruction or a similar memorandum to notify the individual’s commander to
        consider SIF establishment.        If the individual is Sensitive Compartmented
        Information (SCI)-indoctrinated, notify the servicing Special Security Office (SSO),
        who will in turn notify the individual’s commander.
        8.2.2.1.3. (Added-SMC) SMC/PIP provides guidance to commanders on SIF
        establishment and manages all SIFs. SMC/IN SSO is the OPR for all SCI access SIFs
        as applicable.
        8.2.2.1.4. (Added-SMC) SMC/PIP is delegated SIF acknowledgment authority on
        behalf of SMC/CC and associated Wings to include 61 ABG. Disagreements between
        Unit Commanders/Directors SMC/PIP on SIF establishment, will be elevated to
        SMC/CC for a final determination.
     8.2.2.2. Establishes, processes, maintains, monitors SIFs for commanders. See
     Attachment 15 for sample memorandum for notification to the commander of SIF
     establishment. See Attachment 16 for sample SIF custodian checklist.
     8.2.2.3. Provides initial notification to the CAF upon SIF establishment via message or
     CAVS within 10 days. Provide full name, SSAN, security clearance data, date SIF
     established, reason, and if access to classified information and SCI has been suspended or
     withdrawn. If the individual has or is being processed for SCI access, forward the
     notification to the CAF through the MAJCOM or activity SSO. Notify the CAF via
     memorandum when the individual will be permitted to continue access to classified
     information and SCI access. See Attachment 17 for sample memorandum. Notify the
     CAF via memorandum when the individual’s access is withdrawn. Process SIFs
     concerning SCI access according to AFMAN 14-304. If SCI access is involved, the SSO
     is responsible for managing the SIF in its entirety to include actions required for the
     security clearance. SF, SSO, and PSO exchange notification information and coordinate
     actions with each other. Additionally, notify the CAF when:
        8.2.2.3.1. Unfavorable information results in a discharge, retirement, or separation.
        Forward a copy of the discharge or separation orders or a copy of the SF 50B3PT,
        Notification of Personnel Action, plus any additional unfavorable information used in
        these actions. If discharge is involved and the individual is or has been indoctrinated
        for SCI in the past three years, see AFMAN 14-304 for discharge for cause
        procedures.
        8.2.2.3.2. An adverse discharge is overturned and the individual returns to active
        duty.
     8.2.2.4. Notifies the Installation Commander when SIFs are established. See
     Attachment 18 for sample memorandum.
        8.2.2.4.1. (Added-SMC) SMC/PIP provides SMC/CC a quarterly SIF and

       access granting authorities. Notifies the commander for further action, when necessary.
8.3. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. AFOSI conducts personnel security
investigation leads in overseas areas for DSS. All Air Force commanders must report to AFOSI
any alleged criminal activity falling under the security standards criteria. A table of offenses by
case category that AFOSI investigates is available in AFI 71- 101, Volume I, Criminal
Investigations.
8.4. Final Unfavorable Administrative Actions.
   8.4.1. The CAF is the designated authority to make personnel security determinations that
   can result in an unfavorable administrative action. Commanders take actions for removal due
   to unsuitability IAW 5 CFR 731.201-202, Suitability for Government Employment, at the
   same time as actions are being taken for denial or revocation of a person’s security clearance.
   The unfavorable administrative action on civilian personnel may not include any reference to
   security clearance issues until the results of the final security adjudication are available.
8.5. Procedures.
   8.5.1. General. The CAF will make a final personnel security determination resulting in an
   unfavorable clearance action on an Air Force member, civilian employee, contractor (for
   SCI), or any other Air Force affiliated person when the individual concerned has been
   afforded due process procedures according to this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. These same due
   process procedures are also applicable for suspension, denial, or revocation of access to SCI.
   There is no distinction between a security clearance and SCI access in the adjudication
   process. If a clearance is revoked or denied, SCI access is also revoked or denied. The CAF
   will notify individuals concerning unfavorable administrative actions using the instructions in
   this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. Although SAP access is also revoked or denied when a
   clearance is revoked or denied, administrative recourse (appeal) procedures are separate and
   distinct. See AFI 16-702, The Appeal Board (for Special Access Programs).
   8.5.2. The Air Force is not authorized to make any adverse security clearance determination
   on a civilian employee occupying a nonsensitive position. Since such positions do not
   involve sensitive duties or access to classified information, the provisions of the personnel
   security program regarding security clearance eligibility do not apply.
   8.5.3. Confinement. When it is determined that an applicant for a security clearance, or a
   person holding a clearance, has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for
   more than one year, the clearance of such person shall be denied or revoked with the
   following actions taken by the CAF:
       8.5.3.1. Verification that the individual is presently imprisoned, serving a term of more
       than 12 months.
       8.5.3.2. A Notice of Revocation or Denial of Security Clearance Eligibility forwarded
       through the Servicing Security Activity and SSO (for SCI) to the individual and the
       commander. The Notice is final and no rebuttal privileges or appeal rights are applicable.
       8.5.3.3. The revocation or denial action is entered in DCII and AMS.
8.6. Unfavorable Administrative Action Procedures.
48                                     AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


  8.6.1. Denial Authority. The CAF provides individuals with written statements of reasons
  and other required documentation stating intent to deny or revoke their security clearances
  and SCI access using sample format in DOD 5200.2-R, App L and Atch 11.
     8.6.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Statements of reason (SOR) are sent to the subject’s
     commander through the SSA. Upon receipt, the SSA will hand deliver the SOR to the
     subject’s commander and will thoroughly explain the SOR. This cannot be delegated.
  8.6.2. Instructions. Individuals may appeal unfavorable administrative actions according to
  the instructions in this AFI, DOD 5200.2-R, Chapter 8, and Appendix L and M. Individuals
  send communications to the CAF and the local supporting Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)
  through their commanders.
  8.6.2. (AFSPC) Submit appeals through the SSA.
  8.6.3. Designated Point of Contact (POC). Unit commanders will designate a POC to serve
  as a liaison between the CAF and individuals under their jurisdiction when unfavorable
  administrative actions are being taken. POCs conduct the associated duties as outlined in
  DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix L-2. The CAF will send communications to the individual through
  the commander, SF, and SSO (for SCI). The supporting SJA will provide the Defense Office
  of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge (AJ) appropriate legal support, upon
  request.
     8.6.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Since SORs are sensitive in nature, careful consideration must
     be given in the selection of the designated point of contact (POC). The POC must be an
     individual responsible for handling sensitive personnel issues, such as first sergeants,
     supervisors, deputy commanders/directors, etc.
  8.6.4. Individual’s Response to the CAF. Individuals must advise the CAF in writing of their
  intent to respond to the statements of reasons. This must be done within ten days of receipt of
  the statement of reasons. Individuals state whether they intend to submit statements or
  documents to refute, correct, or mitigate the intended actions. Within 60 days from the date
  of receipt of statements of reasons, individuals must provide the CAF with their written
  rebuttals.
  8.6.4. (AFSPC) Submit response through the SSA. The SSA will provide any assistance
  necessary to the designated POC and the subject in responding to the SOR. The SSA will
  update the ―SOR Update‖ screen in JPAS with each action for tracking purposes.
  8.6.5. Extensions. Extensions may only be granted by the CAF. A written request for an
  extension for up to 30 days can be submitted to the CAF through the POC and installation or
  unit commander.
  8.6.6. CAF Review of Individual’s Response to the Statement of Reasons. Upon receipt of
  the rebuttal, the CAF will determine whether a security clearance should be reinstated,
  revoked, or denied and a final response will be provided to the individual. This must be done
  within 60 days from the date of receipt of the individual’s response. If a final response cannot
  be completed within 60 days, the individual must be notified in writing of this fact, the
  reasons, and the date a final response is expected. AMS will be updated to reflect the CAF
  decision.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                        49


   8.6.7. CAF Decision to Deny or Revoke. If the CAF decision is to deny or revoke a person’s
   security clearance the reasons for the final action will be included in a Letter of
   Denial/Revocation to the individual. Individuals will be afforded an opportunity to appeal to
   a letter of denial/revocation through the Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) by one of
   two methods as outlined in this section and DOD 5200.2-R: (1) appeal without a personal
   appearance; or (2) appeal with a personal appearance before an Administrative Judge (AJ)
   from DOHA. Individuals must elect either (1) or (2); individuals may not do both. The CAF
   will process appeal cases as outlined in DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix L and Atch 11.
       8.6.7.1. Appeal Without a Personal Appearance. Individuals directly notify the PSAB of
       their intent to appeal without a personal appearance within 10 days of receipt of the letter
       of denial/revocation. Address requests to: President, Personnel Security Appeal Board,
       NAIC/IAN, 5113 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3230. Individuals send their
       appeals to the President of the PSAB within 40 days of receipt of the letter of
       denial/revocation.
       8.6.7.2. Appeal With a Personal Appearance. Individuals include the name and telephone
       number of the supporting SJA when requesting a personal appearance from DOHA (see
       Attachment 13). The POC will provide this information to the individual. DOHA
       initially contacts the SJA for support with the appeal proceedings. Individuals advise
       DOHA in writing of their desire for a personal appearance within 10 days of receipt of
       the letters of denial/revocation. Copies of these advisement’s are provided to the
       following: the POC, the supporting SJA, and the CAF. The SJA will coordinate with the
       DOHA AJ to assist in providing legal support, upon request and will advise on legal
       matters to the commander and the POC. The CAF will provide the individual’s case file
       to DOHA within 10 days upon DOHA’s request. A DOHA AJ will hear the individual’s
       case and forward the file, transcripts, any documentation obtained from the individual,
       and a recommendation to sustain or overturn the letter of denial/revocation to the PSAB.
       The deadline for this is 30 days after the personal appearance. The AJ provides the CAF
       with a copy of the recommendation.
           8.6.7.2.1. Within CONUS personal appearances will be conducted at the individual’s
           duty station or at a nearby location for duty stations within the lower 48 states. For
           personnel assigned OCONUS, the appearances will be conducted at: (1) the
           individual’s duty station or a nearby suitable location; or (2) at DOHA facilities
           located in the metropolitan area of Washington, DC, or Los Angeles, California. The
           Director, DOHA or designee determines the appearance location. Travel and TDY
           costs for the individual will be the responsibility of the employing organization.
   8.6.8. Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB). The PSAB will review the individuals
   appeal package, along with DOHA recommendation (if applicable) and notify the individual
   through the CAF of the board’s final decision. See Attachment 5 for additional guidance on
   the PSAB.

8.9. Obtaining Permission to Proceed in Courts-Martial, Administrative Discharges, and
Civilian Removal Actions.
   8.9.1. Unit commanders contemplating disciplinary or administrative action against military
   members or civilian employees that could lead to a discharge or removal must first obtain
   permission to proceed when personnel hold a special access. Do not take action on personnel
   who now hold or have held access within the periods specified below, to Single Integrated
   Operational Plan-Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOPESI), SCI, research and
   development (R&D) special access program, AFOSI special access program, or other special
   access program information until the appropriate special access program office approves.
   (Exceptions are for investigative and preliminary administrative procedures until the
   proposed action has been reviewed and approved by the functional activities having overall
   ownership for the affected information.) Commanders send a written request to the
   appropriate special access program functional office for permission to proceed with further
   processing as outlined below. Apply security classification according to message contents.
   The request must include:
       8.9.1.1. The individual’s name, SSAN, age, marital status, duty assignment, unit
       assignment, date of separation and length of service of the member.
       8.9.1.2. The name of the official who authorized SCI or other special access. Include
       inclusive dates that the person was given access and the units involved.
       8.9.1.3. The specific reason for the proposed ―for cause‖ action. Include the maximum
       sentence and type of separation, or discharge, or dismissal allowable.
       8.9.1.4. The type of separation, discharge, or dismissal contemplated in administrative
       cases, and the commander’s recommended type of discharge certificate to be issued.
       8.9.1.5. The type of court-martial, to include a description of offenses, with an outline of
       proposed charges and specifications; data as to any restraint; and any unusual
       circumstances which may affect the trial.
       8.9.1.6. Comparable data for civilian employees.
       8.9.1.7. Any other information bearing on the proposed action.
   8.9.2. For SCI access contact the servicing MAJCOM or FOA Senior Intelligence Officer
   (SIO) for persons having current SCI access, and persons debriefed within the past three
   years, where damage assessment is considered minimal. Contact the servicing Special
   Security Office (SSO) to determine if the individual had SCI access. Commanders will
   continue to forward ―Authority to Proceed‖ requests, where disclosure could result in serious
   damage, to SSO HQ USAF/INSD for AF Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and
   Reconnaissance (HQ USAF/XOI) approval. Send the request as a Defense Special Security
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                       51


  Communications System (DSSCS) message through the SSO to the MAJCOM or FOA SIO
  and to SSO HQ USAF/INSD. See AFMAN 14-304 for detailed instructions on how to
  prepare the DSSCS message.
  8.9.3. For SIOP-ESI access. Refer to AFI 10-1102, Safeguarding the Single Integrated
  Operational Plan (SIOP).
  8.9.4. For R&D access contact SAF/AQL for persons having current access to R&D special
  access programs and persons debriefed within the past year.
  8.9.5. For persons who have had a duty assignment with AFOSI and have held an AFOSI
  special access contact HQ AFOSI/IVO. The personnel records will reflect AFOSI
  employment or assignment. Commanders contact the local AFOSI detachment commander
  or HQ AFOSI/IVO to determine if the person held an AFOSI special access.
  8.9.6. For multiple accesses, commanders must obtain separate authorizations from each
  appropriate action agency listed above prior to proceeding.
  8.9.7. Processing goals at all command levels must comply with the speedy trial requirement
  and the potentially more restrictive time requirements in civilian removal actions. Normally,
  the processing time period should be concluded within 15 days; measured from the date of
  initiation request, to the date of approval; or denial by the OPR. Voluntary separations of
  airmen, officers, and civilian resignations will not be handled under these procedures unless
  they are in lieu of adverse action. For voluntary separations that are in lieu of adverse action,
  do not allow the separation authority to approve the separation until the appropriate action
  office grants authority to proceed.
  8.9.8. If a commander contemplates a general or special court-martial, processing of the case
  may proceed through preferral of charges and completion of the investigation required by
  Article 32, UCMJ together with collateral actions required under Article 32. Under no
  circumstances may the charges be referred to trial until the appropriate action office grants
  authority to proceed. Actions required by this paragraph do not apply to summary court-
  martials.
  8.9.9. If a commander contemplates discharging an enlisted member, processing of a
  "notification" case or a board hearing entitlement may proceed through giving the member
  notice of the proposed discharge, obtaining the member's response, scheduling necessary
  appointments, and conducting those appointments. Under no circumstances may the
  discharge be "approved" by the separation authority until the appropriate action office grants
  authority to proceed. For board hearing cases, the processing may proceed through initiation
  of the case, obtaining the member’s response, scheduling necessary appointments, and
  conducting those appointments. Under no circumstances may the convening authority order
  the board to be convened to hear the case until the appropriate action office grants authority
  to proceed.
  8.9.10. If a commander or staff agency chief contemplates discharging an officer, the show
  cause authority may not initiate the discharge, issue the show cause memorandum, or
  otherwise require officers to show cause for retention until the appropriate action office
  grants authority to proceed.
52                                     AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


  8.9.11. If a supervisor contemplates removal action against a civilian employee who holds
  special access, the supervisor must first coordinate with the servicing CPF. The commander
  of the unit to which the civilian is assigned will then forward a message to the appropriate
  Air Force OPR. Under no circumstances may a "notice of proposed removal" be issued until
  the Air Force OPR grants authority to proceed.
  8.9.12. Periodic reporting by the unit commanders should advise the parent MAJCOM and
  decision authority of any changes to the proposed action every 90 days until the action has
  been completed. If the nature of the case changes significantly (for example, from discharge
  to court martial or from voluntary to involuntary discharge), the unit commander should
  notify the decision authority and seek further instruction. Unit commanders should transmit a
  final report when the adverse action has been completed. In the final report, include date and
  place of discharge. If a SIF has been established on the individual, the commander will notify
  the CAF of the discharge, and request closure of the SIF.
     8.9.12.1. (Added-SMC) AFCAF requires a DD 214 for military or SF 50 for civil
     servants to close SIF actions. ASPM/USM will make every attempt to obtain DD 214 or
     SF 50 and will forward the document to SMC/PIP. If documents cannot be obtained, the
     Unit Commander/Director will submit a memorandum to SMC/PIP stating that the
     subject is no longer employed at their respective organization.
  8.9.13. Decision authorities submit an annual report of completed cases showing the number
  of cases considered, number of approvals and disapprovals, and number pending as of the
  end of the fiscal year to SAF/AAZ, 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 203301720.
  For SCI: Quarterly Reporting Requirement (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct): MAJCOM and FOA SIOs will
  submit quarterly reports to 497 IG/INSD (SSO), 229 Brookley Ave, Bolling AFB DC 20332-
  7040. For case management and control purposes include in the reports (1) name, grade,
  SSAN, organization; (2) reason for action (drug abuse, minor disciplinary infraction, etc); (3)
  proposed action (type discharge or court martial); (4) date authority to proceed given by SIO;
  and (5) current disposition (indicate whether case is open or closed). If closed, show type and
  date of discharge.

information. Replaces the ASCAS.
Service—Honorable active duty (including attendance at the military academies), membership in
ROTC Scholarship Program, Army and Air Force National Guard, Military Reserve Force
(including active status and ready reserve), civilian employment in government service, or
civilian employment with a DOD contractor involving access under the National Industrial
Security Program. Continuity of service is maintained with change from one status to another
provided no single break in service is greater than 24 months.
SCI Screening Interview—A representative from the SSO or a security manager will conduct
an interview to assist in determining the acceptability of an individual for nomination and further
processing for a position requiring access to SCI. This interview is conducted when there is no

NOTES:
1. A NACLC is a prerequisite for military members upon entry. DOD civilians receive a NACIC
as a prerequisite for federal employment. These investigations exceed the required investigations
and can be used for unescorted entry.
2. Air Reserve forces personnel with a current ENTNAC or NAC on file may have unescorted
entry to restricted areas while in civilian status, pending completion of the required NACIC.
3. Prior ENTNAC/NAC/NACI/NACIC investigations meet the requirements for prior military
members who have been separated. Commanders may waive on a case by case basis, the
investigative requirements for unescorted entry to restricted areas containing Protection Level
(PL) 2 and or 3 resources pending completion of a favorable NACLC, NAC, or NACIC after
favorable review of the completed personnel security questionnaire for the investigation.
4. Installation records checks on employees in child care services include a check of the state
criminal history repository. The state criminal history repository checks are for suitability
affecting the consolidated civilian personnel office and morale, welfare, and recreation programs.
The sponsoring activity sends out and receives the state criminal history repository.

NOTES:
1. Send a request letter through channels to the approving authority when non-US nationals or
immigrant alien personnel require limited access to Secret or Confidential defense information or
unescorted entry to PL 1, 2, or 3 restricted areas.
2. Complete items 10 through 14 when an investigation or a security clearance is required. The
LFC is not required when recording special access program authorizations, unless specified in
the governing directive. This guidance also applies to sections IV and V.
3. If the individual records derogatory information in Section VII, promptly notify the requester
and security information file custodians. This action determines if re-adjudication of the
person’s security clearance is necessary by the CAF. This guidance also applies to Section V.
4. Ensure the request process includes a review of SK for evidence of an UIF concerning the
member. Also, review personnel records to determine if derogatory information exists from a
personnel security standpoint. Check personnel records to confirm other data, such as
employment or military service as listed on SF Form 86, when necessary. Persons designated to
sign Item 14 of the form must take or confirm these actions. Enter results of these reviews in
Section VII.

5. Note that this authority may be delegated to other medical staff personnel who may review
medical records and form professional opinions based on the information being evaluated. If no
medical records are on file (as for many civil service employees) annotate the form to that effect.
The DD Form 1879 then shows no local medical records were checked and DSS agents check
the records.
6. Review the records of the security clearance function and reports and analysis section. If a
SIF exists, deny the requested personnel security action pending completion of adjudication
actions. In these cases, also enter in Section VII that a SIF exists. Also, review the remarks
section for any other derogatory information reported and evaluate the need to establish a SIF for
further adjudication. Enter results of this evaluation in Section VII.
7. Annotate Section VII to reflect what document was used to verify citizenship status.

A24.1. Implementation of the Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States Code, to add a
new section that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the DoD
under four specific circumstances as outlined below.
   A24.1.1. Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts,
   including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of more than one year, regardless of the
   amount of time actually served.
   A24.1.2. Provision (2) does not change the substance of the existing adjudication guideline
   relative to current drug involvement. Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or
   addicted to, a controlled substance.
   A24.1.3. Provision (3) does not change the substance of the adjudication guidelines for
   emotional, mental, or personality disorders. Anyone who is found to be mentally incompetent
   (incapable of safeguarding classified information) by a credentialed mental health
   professional approved by DoD.
   A24.1.4. Provision (4) disqualifies persons who have been discharged or dismissed from the
   Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.
A24.2. Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a waiver in meritorious cases under provisions
(1) & (4). Waiver authority is not delegable.
A24.3. Provision (2) & (3) disqualifies a person for eligibility for a security clearance and may
not be waived.
A24.4. Individuals that fall under the categories (1) through (4) will be afforded applicable due
process and appeal opportunity IAW the DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program and this
instruction.
A24.5. When AFCAF issues a final statement of reasons to deny or revoke a security clearance
in cases where a waiver is allowed (provisions 1 and 4) the subject will be informed of the
waiver provision, provided a copy of the statute and other information on how to respond. The
subject must include in the response to the statement of reasons if they want to be considered for
a waiver, if applicable.
A24.6. Decision process for determining whether a particular case warrents a meritorious
waiver:
   A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case warrants
   a meritorious waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case is forwarded
   with the proposed request for waiver and full justification to the Air Force Personnel Security
   Appeal Board (PSAB) for review.
   A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case summary is
   returned to the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
       A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF with
       recommendation for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                    109


A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month
following the end of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF. SAF/AA provides
report to USD/I by the 15th..
A24.8. The statute policy applies to:
   A24.8.1. All initial determinations to grant security clearance eligibility or access and
   determinations to continue clearance eligibility/accesses following a reinvestigation.
   A24.8.2. Existing clearances eligibility or access which a previous or other investigation
   reveals a previous favorably resolved issue involving one or more of the four statutory
   provisions, regardless of the presence or absence of subsequent disqualifying issues;
   A24.8.3. Previous and follow-on periodic reinvestigations and other investigations initiated
   for other reasons; such as:
       A24.8.3.1. Security Information File, Special Investigation Inquiry, etc., and all pending
       cases in which a final decision had not been issued as of 7 Jun 01.
A24.9. The statue polices do not apply to:
   A24.9.1. Conversions/transfers/reinstatements of current DoD security clearances, including
   transfers of clearances of employees within the DoD, clearances of employees who fall under
   the National Industrial Security Program, and transfers of clearances to the DoD of

AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                     113


2.4. Types and Scope of Personnel Security Investigations. The scope of each type of
personnel security investigation is listed in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix B. See Attachment 2 for
procedures on requesting personnel security investigations (PSI). See Attachment 3 for
guidance on the types of required personnel security investigations and appropriate questionnaire
forms and or Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) Software.
2.4.1. General. The investigations listed in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R and this instruction are the
only PSIs authorized. The Secretary of the Air Force and/or the Under Secretary of Defense,
Intelligence must approve raising or lowering the scope of the authorized investigation.


2.5 Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider. The Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) is the DoD Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider.


2.7. Overseas Personnel Security Investigations. AFOSI personnel conduct the overseas
portion of personnel security investigations, augmented by Army, Navy, and State Department
counterparts.


3.11. Interim Security Clearances. Commanders may grant interim security clearances for
access to Top Secret and Secret information when the requirements of DoD 5200.2-R, paragraph
3.401 have been met. Use of local information and the following requirements provide
Commanders with the necessary tools to exercise their authority to grant interim security
clearances. Also see Attachment 25, Table A25.1 for guidance on the authority level to grant
interim security clearance/access to specific programs.
3.11.1. Interim Top Secret security clearances:
3.11.1.1 Favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI completed.
3.11.1.2. Consult the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to determine the existence of
a favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI. The investigation is
acceptable if there is no break in service over two years.
3.11.1.3. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
3.11.1.4. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security force records, medical
records, and other security records, as appropriate.
3.11.1.5. SSBI package has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to the investigative
agency provider.
3.11.2. Commanders can grant interim Top Secret security clearance if the above provisions have
been met.
3.11.3. If there is no record of a completed investigation (NAC portion) in JPAS, contact Air
Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) Customer Support through JPAS to determine if
there is a favorable NAC. (Note Optional: Authorized requesters can request ―Advanced NAC
Results‖ from OPM on the OPM Agency Use Sheet.)
3.11.4. Interim Secret security clearances:
 114                                     AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


3.11.4.1. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
3.11.4.2. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security forces records,
medical records, and other security records, as appropriate.
3.11.4.3. NACLC or ANACI has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to an investigative
agency provider.
3.11.5. Interim security clearances must be documented in JPAS or in writing if JPAS is
unavailable, until the final security clearance eligibility is granted by the AFCAF.
3.11.6. For Civilians:
3.11.6.1. Consult JPAS on a newly hired civilian for a previous security clearance/personnel
security investigation to determine if a previous security clearance was held as a former military
member (without a break in service of two years) or if a security clearance as either an Air
Reserve Technician or as a traditional reservist was held.
3.11.6.2. Pending completion of ANACIs or SSBIs, as appropriate, civilians may occupy non-
critical sensitive or critical sensitive positions. Commanders prepare a waiver of pre-employment
investigation requirements when such action is necessary and in the national interest. Interim
security clearance may not be granted until after the commander signs the waiver memorandum.
3.11.7. JPAS is the source for determining investigative status on pending investigations. Also
see para 7.9.


3.28. Periodic Reinvestigations (PR). PRs are required every 5 years for Top Secret and 10
years for Secret. Authorized requesters submit requests for reinvestigations to the DoD
Authorized Investigation Provider as outlined in A2.2.2.1. See AFI 31-406, Applying North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, for submission of PRs for NATO
investigations.


3.29. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Although such personnel normally only require a
Secret clearance, an SSBI is initially required due to training and assignments involving nuclear
weapons. Persons occupying an EOD position shall undergo a Secret PR on a five year recurring
basis.


5.2. Authorized Requesters.
5.2.1. MAJCOM, field operating agency (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) staffs designate
authorized requesters to initiate PSIs for their organization. As a general rule, the number of
authorized requesters will be kept to the minimum number required to meet mission
requirements. See Attachment 2 for request procedures.
5.2.2. Authorized requesters provide the AFCAF with the name, telephone number, and office
symbol of individual(s) who may obtain security clearance and or investigative data on
individuals within their organization and provide copy to respective MAJCOM. See para 6.1 for
AFCAF address.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                        115


5.2.3. Authorized requesters may query the JCAVS or call the CAF Customer Support Section at
DSN 754-1242/43 to determine investigative and/or adjudicative status.
5.2.4. Authorized requesters approve and submit personnel security questionnaires to the DoD
Authorized Personnel Investigation Provider according to Attachment 2.
5.5. Priority Requests. The following sensitive programs are authorized priority processing
service by OPM:
5.5.1. PRP. In cases where a PRP ―C‖ coded case warrants ―Priority‖ service by OPM, the
authorized requester must coordinate the request through channels to AF/XOS-FI. Each
authorized requester will maintain a fiscal year (FY) Excel spreadsheet listing for this purpose.
The spreadsheet will include all previously coordinated FY priority PSIs and all new
requirements the authorized requester is coordinating under this authority. When coordinating
new priority cases, forward the entire FY spreadsheet to afxofi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.
AF/XOS-FI will return to the authorized requester for monitoring the completion of the
investigation.
5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4, Annex A,
para 5), the servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO a copy of the
completed SF 86 for each SSBI request with an SCI access requirement. This will be done at the
same time the request for SSBI/SCI is forwarded to OPM. Security Managers/SSOs/Authorized
Requesters will expedite the processing of the SSBI off the installation to OPM and request
priority level of service. On the OPM Agency Use Sheet annotate 30A in Block A. Also see
AFMAN 14-304.


5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD civilian,
contractor, or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation and they are a dual
citizen and/or possess/use a foreign passport.
5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic disqualifier for
security clearance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship and particularly the
exercise of dual citizenship is a condition that raises a security concern and may be a
disqualifying factor in a security clearance eligibility determination. There are factors that could
mitigate the maintenance of dual citizenship, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, App I, Foreign
Preference. An individual’s expressed willingness to renounce dual citizenship is one of the
conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport in
preference to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s allegiance to the US is
paramount and could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the US. The security clearance
will be denied or revoked, unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official
approval for its use from SAF/AA. Requests for approval are forwarded through respective
Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI for processing to
SAF/AA. Justification must include what benefit the AF will gain from a person holding a
foreign passport. AFCAF will annotate approvals in the remarks field of the JPAS.
5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign passport in item
15 of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on the Standard Form 86,
 116                                      AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


―Questionnaire for National Security Positions,‖ will be required to surrender the passport via
one of the following methods:
5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate via certified receipt
mail. A copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and the return receipt will be
forwarded to the AFCAF. See para 6.1 for AFCAF address. If the name of adjudicator assigned
to the case is known, include this in the ATTN line of the address.
5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the passport and
place in a burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the destruction of the
passport in an explanatory memorandum, which will be forwarded to the AFCAF and a copy
provided to the subject.
5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign passport and dual
citizenship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance eligibility the following
must be completed:
5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign citizenship
claims in favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual renouncement is not required.
5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.
5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport must be
provided to the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to determine security
clearance eligibility.
5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security clearance
determination is made.


6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) is
the Central Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229 Brookely Ave, Bolling AFB
20032.
6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200, 6-102 and
Appendix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for a security clearance
or assignment to sensitive duties.
6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility (see
Chapter 8).
6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility determination.
6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring customers on
pending investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory issues are often resolved
through completion of the investigation and or adjudication of the case. Premature dissemination
of unresolved and or unadjudicated issues could result in discriminatory practices with respect to
such areas as employments or assignments.


6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the JPAS. JPAS
replaced Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                      117



7.1. General
7.1.1. The AFCAF is the designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel
security clearances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).


7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each military and
civilian position in the organization. Investigations are required for multiple purposes: to
determine suitability and/or trustworthiness of individual for employment/assignment to
positions of trust/access to certain programs; and for security clearance. Each position is coded
with the appropriate position code reflecting the required investigation level in the unit manning
document (UMD) and the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). These will also be
reflected in the Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data System (HAF-MDS).
7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:.
7.2.1. l.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
7.2.2.1.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).
7.2.2.1.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI).
7.2.2.1.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI).
7.2.2.1.5. National Agency Check (NAC).
7.2.1.2. The definitions and corresponding codes are located in Attachment 22, Table A22.1.
7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last AF-wide
directed review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each May. Retain results
for review during self inspections, etc.
7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential needs.
7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.
7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). HQ USAF/XOS-FI
approves requests for adding security clearances or investigations as AFSC prerequisites.
Requests are staffed through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification and
AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification will reflect an SSBI requirement for entry, award, and
retention for the respective mandatory AFSCs. See Attachment 22; Table A22.2., A22.3.
7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive programs
that have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e., Presidential Support, Personnel
Reliability Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table A22.4.
7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or Contractual
Exigencies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for deployments will, as a
minimum, be assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret information for the in-country threat
briefing. SSBIs are not authorized for purposes of Top Secret eligibility ―just in case of‖
deployment. In these situations, commanders grant interim Top Secret access for a period of up
 118                                    AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


to 180 days. This can be renewed for extended deployment purposes and for redeployment.
Interim Top Secret access is granted for the purpose of deployment based on the existing
NACLC, and discontinued upon return to home station. SSBIs will not be required for this
purpose. Persons must be US citizens and have not had a break in service for more than 24
months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS or in cases where it is not available,
documented and maintained with security related documents. However, SSBI is authorized if a
joint or theater deployment requires a final Top Secret security clearance and will not accept
interims, i.e., JCS contingencies. These requirements need to be identified and positions coded
IAW para 7.2. of this instruction.
7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian Equivalent
authority is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before the servicing
Manpower Office codes the positions on the UMD. Approval authorized cannot be delegated.
Approval authorities are as follows:
7.6.1. MAJCOMs: CV or NAF/CC
7.6.2. FOAs: parent 2-Ltr or SAF/AA or AF/CVA if the parent 2-Ltr is not at the appropriate
grade level
7.6.3. DRUs: AF/CVA.
7.6.4. HQ USAF:
7.6.4.1. Air Staff: AF/CVA
7.6.4.2. Secretariate: SAF/AA.
7.6.5. Commands will establish internal certifying procedures. The approval documentation will
be retained by the Manpower Office for three years and is subject to compliance review by HQ
AFIA or their designee. Approval will increase MAJCOM funds withhold for personnel security
investigations through the FYDP.
7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for incumbents
assigned against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI. Also see para A2.7.
7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance eligibility and
enters the determination into JPAS.
7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of Defense
(DoD) personnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates personnel security
management for the DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF), security managers, and offers
both non-SCI and SCI functions. It interfaces with the investigative providers, the personnel
systems within the Department thus eliminating manual transactions and expediting the flow of
personnel security information to warfighters.
7.9.1 JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of investigations on
individuals in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the CAFs and its customers. All
information in JPAS is unclassified, but must be protected according to the requirements for
privacy/sensitive information and For Official Use Only (FOUO) in accordance with AFI 33-332,
Air Force Privacy Act Program and DoDR 5400.7/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom of
Information Act Program.
AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011                                                        119


7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) and Joint
Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS)
7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as case
management/distribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and summary, due process,
and future ability for each CAF to electronically access investigative reports from the
investigative providers.
7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used throughout this
instruction.
7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized requesters and
provides capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history, incident/issue file reporting,
history and management of unit personnel security functions.
7.9.2.2.1. JCAVS replaced Clearance and Access Verification System (CAVS), as used
throughout this instruction.
7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user. Clearance data
elements in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation and the full date and status
of security clearance. The information is invalid when any of these four data elements are
incomplete.
7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when more than one
entry appears for an individual.
7.9.3.2. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the subject of a
SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is eligible for SCI access if
required for mission essential purposes and may already have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
7.9.4. The JCAVS will provide the following information:
7.9.4.1. An individual’s security clearance eligibility level and access level.
7.9.4.2. Visit notification.
7.9.4.3. Suspension notification.
7.9.4.4. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates.
7.9.4.5. Establishment of a SIF.
7.9.6. JCAVS User Levels are as follows:

Charge Card abuses and misuses to the appropriate commander. This information constitutes
serious questions as to the individual’s ability or intent to protect classified information or
execute sensitive duties. The commander will make an immediate determination to either leave
the individual’s security status unchanged or suspend their access to classified information or
assignment to sensitive duties until the appropriate authority makes a final determination
regarding the individual’s eligibility to retain a security clearance. In addition, commanders may
take action in accordance with Chapter 8, to determine if a SIF should be established and/or the
person’s access to classified information should be suspended.

Table A22.1. Personnel Security Investigation Position Coding
  Position Investigation Investigation Description
  Code     Type
  5        SSBI          The SSBI is the initial investigation for access to Top Secret
                         (including Top Secret Special Access Programs (SAP), SCI, and for
                         Critical Sensitive Positions.) In addition, the SSBI is required for
                         Mandatory AFSCs or Program Mandates.
  6        NACLC         The NACLC is the prescribed investigation for initial and continued
                         access to Secret and Confidential information for DoD military and
                         contractor personnel. It is also the reinvestigation requirement for
                         federal employees at the same access levels. Also, all military or
                         Mandatory Program Mandate.

  Position Investigation Investigation Description
  Code     Type
  7        ANACI         The ANACI is the investigative requirement for federal employees
                         under Executive Order 10450, ―Suitability for Government Hire,‖ in
                         non-critical sensitive positions that require access to classified
                         information up to the Secret level. Access to Secret (civilian) or
                         Mandatory Program Mandate.
  8        NACI          The NACI is the baseline investigative requirement for entry into
                         government service under Executive Order 10450 and for federal
                         employees in nonsensitive positions that do not require access to
                         classified information. All OPM NACIs conducted for DoD include a
                         credit check (NACIC). Suitability Requirement (civilian).
  9        NAC           The NAC is a records check of designated agencies of the Federal
                         Government that maintain record systems containing information
                         relevant to making personnel security determinations. A NAC is also
                         an integral part of all initial and periodic reinvestigations and is the
                         baseline for trustworthiness determinations. Trustworthiness

SMITH AMENDMENT
A24.1. Implementation of the Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States Code, to add a
new section that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the DoD
under four specific circumstances as outlined below.
A24.1.1. Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts,
including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of more than one year, regardless of the
amount of time actually served.
A24.1.2. Provision (2) does not change the substance of the existing adjudication guideline
relative to current drug involvement. Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or addicted to,
a controlled substance.
A24.1.3. Provision (3) does not change the substance of the adjudication guidelines for
emotional, mental, or personality disorders. Anyone who is found to be mentally incompetent
(incapable of safeguarding classified information) by a credentialed mental health professional
approved by DoD.
A24.1.4. Provision (4) disqualifies persons who have been discharged or dismissed from the
Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.
A24.2. Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a waiver in meritorious cases under provisions
(1) & (4). Waiver authority is not delegable.
A24.3. Provision (2) & (3) disqualifies a person for eligibility for a security clearance and may
not be waived.
A24.4. Individuals that fall under the categories (1) through (4) will be afforded applicable due
process and appeal opportunity IAW the DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program and this
instruction.
A24.5. When AFCAF issues a final statement of reasons to deny or revoke a security clearance
in cases where a waiver is allowed (provisions 1 and 4) the subject will be informed of the
waiver provision, provided a copy of the statute and other information on how to respond. The
subject must include in the response to the statement of reasons if they want to be considered for
a waiver, if applicable.
A24.6. Decision process for determining whether a particular case warrents a meritorious waiver:
 134                                      AFI31-501_AFSPCSUP_SMCSUP_I 15 APRIL 2011


A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case warrants a
meritorious waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case is forwarded with
the proposed request for waiver and full justification to the Air Force Personnel Security Appeal
Board (PSAB) for review.
A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case summary is
returned to the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF with
recommendation for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month following
the end of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF. SAF/AA provides report to
USD/I by the 15th.
A24.8. The statute policy applies to:
A24.8.1. All initial determinations to grant security clearance eligibility or access and
determinations to continue clearance eligibility/accesses following a reinvestigation;
A24.8.2. Existing clearances eligibility or access which a previous or other investigation reveals
a previous favorably resolved issue involving one or more of the four statutory provisions,
regardless of the presence or absence of subsequent disqualifying issues;
A24.8.3. Previous and follow-on periodic reinvestigations and other investigations initiated for
other reasons; such as:
A24.8.3.1. Security Information File, Special Investigation Inquiry, etc., and all pending cases in
which a final decision had not been issued as of 7 Jun 01.
A24.9. The statue polices do not apply to:
A24.9.1. Conversions/transfers/reinstatements of current DoD security clearances, including
transfers of clearances of employees within the DoD, clearances of employees who fall under the
National Industrial Security Program, and transfers of clearances to the DoD of employees
coming from other Federal agencies.
