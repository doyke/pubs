                                   GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of the T-38.
With the complementary references cited, this instruction prescribes standard operational
procedures to be used by all pilots operating T-38 aircraft.
1.2. Pilot's Responsibility. This instruction, in conjunction with other governing directives,
prescribes T-38 procedures under most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for
sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the
safe and effective operation of the aircraft.
1.3. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of the MAJCOM
Director of Operations (A3) unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates
otherwise, in which case the PIC will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
1.4. References:
     1.4.1. The primary references for T-38 operations are Technical Order (TO) 1T-38A-1,
     Flight Manual, USAF Series T-38A and AT-38B Aircraft; TO 1T-38C-1, Flight Manual,
     USAF Series T-38C Aircraft; AFMAN 11-251, Volume 1, T-38C Flying Fundamentals;
     AFMAN 11-250, Volume 1, T-38 Flying Fundamentals; and this instruction.
     1.4.2. Training units may develop phase manuals from the procedures contained in these
     documents. Phase manuals may be used to augment initial and mission qualification training.
     Phase manuals may expand these basic procedures, but in no case will they be less
     restrictive.
1.5. Recommended Changes and Waivers:
     1.5.1. According to AFPD 11-2, AF/A3/5 is approval authority for changes or revisions to
     this instruction.
     1.5.2. The MAJCOM/A3 is waiver authority for this instruction. Waiver requests may be
     submitted in message or memo format.

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by the individual
pilots and the operations functions of organizations.
2.2. General Procedures:
   2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI 11-
   202, Volume 3, specifies minimum requirements.
   2.2.2. Pilots will compute takeoff and landing data for all flights. MAJCOM-approved tab
   data may be used when available.
   2.2.3. MAJCOMs will provide guidance on use of flight planning software.
   2.2.4. The T-38C navigation system with Block 8 software (and later) is certified for
   instrument flight rules (IFR) en route navigation according to FAA’s TSO-C129A, Airborne
   Supplemental Navigation Equipment Using the Global Positioning System (GPS); Class
   C(2); and Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) document DO-208,
   Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Airborne Supplemental Navigation
   Equipment Using Global Positioning System (GPS), Change 1, located at
   http://www.rtca.org/. The navigation system has been installed according to FAA Advisory
   Circular (AC) 20-130A, Airworthiness Approval of Navigation or Flight Management
   Systems Integrating Multiple Navigation Sensors, and meets the associated requirements of
   AC 20-138A, Airworthiness Approval of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   Equipment, and AC 90-45A, Approval of Area Navigation Systems for use in the U.S.
   National                  Airspace                System.              Go              to
   http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFra
   me?OpenFrameSet and click ―by number‖ to find these ACs.
2.3. Map and Chart Preparation:
   2.3.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
   divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
   remain within assigned training areas.
   2.3.2. Charts. Flight information publication (FLIP) en route charts may be used instead of
   maps on navigational flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.
   2.3.3. Low Altitude Maps:
       2.3.3.1. On low-altitude flights (500 feet to 1,000 feet above ground level [AGL]), each
       pilot in the flight will carry a current map of the low altitude route or operating area. The
       map will be of such scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations
       are of sufficient detail to allow individual navigation and safe mission accomplishment.
       2.3.3.2. Prepare maps for low-altitude flights according MAJCOM guidance and as
       directed locally. Pilots will highlight all man-made obstacles at or above the planned
       flight altitude and annotate time and distance tick-marks on low-level maps to ensure
 8                                                       AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


        positive positional awareness of obstacles within 5 nautical miles (NM) on either side of
        the planned route of flight.
        2.3.3.3. Annotate all maps with a route abort altitude (RAA). Compute the RAA for the
        entire route or area at a minimum of 1,000 feet separation from the highest
        obstacle/terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within the lateral limits of
        the route or training area, but in no case less than 5 NM either side of planned course
        (black line).
2.4. Briefing and Debriefing:
     2.4.1. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing that will promote safe,
     effective mission accomplishment. In addition, the following guidance applies:
        2.4.1.1. All pilots, crewmembers, and passengers will attend the briefing and debriefing
        unless previously coordinated with the Flight Lead/Instructor Pilot (IP), or with unit
        supervisors if Flight Lead/IP is not immediately available.
        2.4.1.2. For local sorties, briefings will begin at least 1 hour before scheduled takeoff.
        2.4.1.3. During deployed operations, exercises, and quick-turns, if all flight members
        attend an initial or mass flight briefing, the flight lead on subsequent flights during the
        same flight duty period must brief only those items that have changed from the previous
        flights.
        2.4.1.4. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the capabilities of each pilot in the
        flight.
        2.4.1.5. Use briefing guides to provide the flight lead or briefer with a reference list of
        items which may apply to particular missions. Items listed may be briefed in any
        sequence. Those items understood by all participants may be briefed as ―standard.‖
        Specific items not pertinent to the mission need not be covered.
        2.4.1.6. During the briefing for all low-level missions, emphasize the following items:
        obstacle awareness, ground avoidance, pilot determination of low-altitude comfort level,
        and the avoidance of complacency.
        2.4.1.7. The squadron operations officer will approve dissimilar formations. When
        dissimilar aircraft are flown in formation, proper position (to ensure adequate wingtip
        clearance), responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements will be briefed for each
        phase of flight.
        2.4.1.8. When appropriate, brief an alternate mission for each flight. The alternate
        mission will be less complex and should parallel the primary mission.
        2.4.1.9. Mission elements and events may be modified and coordinated airborne as long
        as flight safety is not compromised. Unbriefed missions or events will not be flown.
        Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members.
        2.4.1.10. All missions will be debriefed.
     2.4.2. Required topics for flight briefing guides are contained in Attachments 3 through 13.
     Units may augment these guides as necessary. The following is a listing of the briefing
     guides in this instruction:

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Ground Visual Signals. The pilot will ensure that no system that could pose any danger to
the ground crew is activated prior to receiving proper acknowledgment from ground personnel.
When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-218,
Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. The crew chief will repeat
the given signal when it is safe to operate the system.
3.2. Preflight:
   3.2.1. Baggage or equipment will not be carried in an unoccupied T-38 rear cockpit, except
   in approved cargo carriers. Exception: Aircrew flight equipment may be secured in the rear
   cockpit.
   3.2.2. Objects will not be placed on top of the glare shield during start with the canopies
   open.
   3.2.3. Publications, maps, and personal items placed in the cockpit will be secured to avoid
   flight control or throttle interference.
   3.2.4. After TCTO 1T-38C-546, no items will be placed under ejection seats. Before TCTO
   1T-38C-546, place only soft-sided, pliable items under ejection seats.
   3.2.5. Cans of oil or hydraulic fluid will not be carried in the aircraft, except in the weapon
   system support pod (WSSP).
3.3. Fuel Requirements:
   3.3.1. Joker Fuel. A prebriefed fuel needed to terminate an event and transition to the next
   phase of flight.
   3.3.2. Bingo Fuel. A prebriefed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel.
   3.3.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the final approach fix (FAF) at the
   base of intended landing or alternate, if required. Fuel quantity will be as established locally
   or 800 pounds, whichever is higher.
   3.3.4. Minimum and Emergency Fuel. When it becomes apparent an aircraft will land at
   the base of intended landing or alternate (if required), declare the following (as applicable):
       3.3.4.1. Minimum fuel--600 pounds or less.
       3.3.4.2. Emergency fuel--400 pounds or less.
3.4. Ground and Taxi Operations.
   3.4.1. Taxi Interval. The minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.
   Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Use caution to avoid
   jet blast when canopies are open.
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  11


   3.4.2. Ice or Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice or snow conditions until all portions
   of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. When ice or snow are
   present on the taxiway, taxi on the center line with a minimum of 300 feet of spacing.
3.5. Before-Takeoff Checks. Before TCTO 1T-38C-546, pilots will remove and properly stow
ejection seat and canopy jettison safety pins once clear of the aircraft parking area, but not later
than completion of the before takeoff checklist according to the appropriate flight crew checklist.
   3.5.1. After the before-takeoff checks have been completed and prior to takeoff, flight
   members will inspect accompanying aircraft for proper configuration and any abnormalities.
   3.5.2. Pilots will use the videotape recorder or video-data transfer system to the maximum
   extent practical.
3.6. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up as appropriate based on weather conditions, runway
conditions, and runway width. If formation takeoffs are planned, wingmen must maintain
wingtip clearance with their element leader. If runway width permits, line up with wingtip
clearance between all aircraft in the flight. Trailing elements will delay engine run up if pilots
cannot ensure wingtip clearance. Place the wingman on the upwind side if the crosswind exceeds
5 knots.
3.7. Takeoff:
   3.7.1. Do not take off when the runway condition reading (RCR) is less than 10.
   3.7.2. Takeoff data will be reviewed and understood by every member of the flight.
   Particular emphasis should be placed on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations
   such as short or wet runway, heavy gross weights, nonstandard barrier configurations, and
   abort sequence in formation flights.
   3.7.3. Do not take off if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent (single ship or interval
   takeoff) or 70 percent of the available runway (formation takeoff).
   3.7.4. The operations group commander may approve intersection takeoffs if operational
   requirements dictate.
   3.7.5. Use afterburner (AB) on all takeoffs.
   3.7.6. Rolling takeoffs are authorized.
   3.7.7. If installed, the instrument hood must be in the retracted position for all takeoffs and
   landings.
3.8. Formation Takeoff:
   3.8.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two aircraft.
   3.8.2. Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP or flight lead qualified
   squadron supervisor is in the element.
   3.8.3. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
       3.8.3.1. Runway width is less than 150 feet.
       3.8.3.2. Standing water, ice, slush, or snow is on the runway.
       3.8.3.3. Crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
 12                                                     AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


      3.8.3.4. Aircraft is being ferried from contractor or Air Force depot-level maintenance
      facilities.
   3.8.4. Takeoff interval between aircraft or elements will be a minimum of 10 seconds. When
   join-up is to be accomplished on top, takeoff interval will be increased to a minimum of 20
   seconds.
      3.8.4.1. After releasing brakes, single ship aircraft will steer toward the center of the
      runway.
3.9. Join-up and Rejoin:
   3.9.1. Day weather criteria for a visual flight rules (VFR) join-up underneath a ceiling is
   1,500 feet and 3 miles visibility.
   3.9.2. Flight leads will maintain 300 knots (KTS) until join-up is accomplished unless
   mission requirements necessitate a different airspeed. Pilots may delay coming out of AB to
   help establish a rate of closure on the leader or lead element.
   3.9.3. Flight leads will not normally exceed 30 degrees of bank during a turning join-up.
   3.9.4. Flight members will join in sequence. For a straight-ahead rejoin, the number 2
   aircraft will join on the left wing and the element will join on the right wing unless otherwise
   briefed. For a turning rejoin, the number 2 aircraft will rejoin on the inside of the turn and the
   element to the outside. If mission or flight requirements dictate, the flight lead will
   specifically direct the desired formation positions.
   3.9.5. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle damage check after each
   mission prior to or during return to base. Established deconfliction responsibilities and
   position change procedures will be according to AFMAN 11-251, Volume 1, or AFMAN 11-
   250, Volume 1. Fly no closer than normal fingertip spacing.
3.10. Maneuvering Parameters:
   3.10.1. Except as specified for range procedures in AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and
   Procedures, the minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL for low altitude maneuvering.
   3.10.2. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during any portion of aerobatic
   maneuvering. Aerobatic flight must be performed in special use airspace.
   3.10.3. Flight through wingtip vortices or jetwash should be avoided. If this is unavoidable,
   the aircraft should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 gravitational load factor (G).
   Use asymmetric G limits if evaluating a jetwash-induced over-G. T-38C pilots will use the
   warning, caution, and advisory system or observed aircraft G to evaluate over-G conditions,
   including asymmetric over-Gs.
   3.10.4. Do not extend the flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft performance.
   3.10.5. Do not attempt to shift the center of gravity by crossfeeding or using differential
   throttles to improve performance.
   3.10.6. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is 150 KTS unless conducting training
   under a formal syllabus that specifies or allows a slower airspeed for the training being
   conducted.
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 13


3.11. Ops Checks:
   3.11.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment.
   Additionally, each pilot will monitor the fuel system carefully throughout the flight to
   identify low fuel, trapped fuel, or an out-of-balance situation as soon as possible. Frequency
   should be increased during tactical maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks are
   required during climb or at level-off after takeoff, before each engagement or intercept,
   before entering an air-to-surface range, once while on the range if multiple passes are made,
   and after departing the range.
   3.11.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, fuel quantities, fuel balance, G-suit
   connection (when appropriate), oxygen system, and cabin altitude.
   3.11.3. For formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal. Response will be made by radio call or visual signal. The query and response for ops
   checks will be based on the amount of fuel and Gs. Normally, pilots will reset the G meter
   between ops checks.
3.12. G-awareness Exercise. Refer to AFI 11-214 (if applicable).
   3.12.1. Aircrew will conduct a G-awareness exercise anytime aircrews plan or are likely to
   maneuver above five Gs during the mission. MAJCOMs may establish additional G-
   awareness exercise requirements.
   3.12.2. Maintain a minimum of 4,000 feet between aircraft. Establish separation prior to
   maneuver execution. During maneuver execution use visual lookout and briefed formation
   contracts as primary means of ensuring aircraft deconfliction. Use other systems only to
   enhance situation awareness; for example, air-to-air tactical air navigation (TACAN), traffic
   collision avoidance system (TCAS), etc.
   3.12.3. Flight leads and pilots will ensure the airspace intended for the G-awareness exercise
   is free from potential conflict. Use air traffic control (ATC) services to the maximum extent
   practicable to make sure the airspace is clear. Conduct the G-awareness exercise in the
   following airspace preference to the order listed in paragraphs 3.15.3.1 through 3.15.3.4:
       3.12.3.1. Special use airspace (for example, restricted or warning areas, ATC assigned
       airspace (ATCAA), military operating areas (MOA), or MAJCOM-approved large scale
       exercise or special missions areas);
       3.12.3.2. Above 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) outside of special use airspace;
       3.12.3.3. Inside the confines of military training routes/low-level training zones; or
       3.12.3.4. Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
3.13. Radio Procedures:
   3.13.1. Preface all communications (except for wingman acknowledgment) with the
   complete flight call sign. Transmit only information essential for mission accomplishment or
   safety of flight. Do not use the radio as a flight ―intercom." Use visual signals whenever
   practical.
   3.13.2. Use a knock it off (KIO) radio call to cease tactical maneuvering when safety of
   flight is a factor, especially for an in-flight emergency. Any flight member may make this
 14                                                     AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


   call. When a dangerous situation is developing, be directive first. A KIO applies to any phase
   of flight and all types of missions. All participants will acknowledge a KIO by repeating the
   call.
   3.13.3. All radio checks and channel changes will be initiated by the flight lead and will be
   acknowledged in turn by individual flight members prior to any flight member switching
   channels. Exception: During radio silent or limited communications operations, channel
   changes will be as briefed.
   3.13.4. Acknowledge radio checks that do not require the transmission of specific data by
   individual flight members in turn (for example, ―2, 3, 4‖). Acknowledgment indicates the
   appropriate action is complete, in the process of being completed, or understood by the flight
   member.
   3.13.5. In addition to the standard radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
   specific mission guides, and FLIP publications, all flight members will acknowledge
   understanding the initial ATC clearance. They will acknowledge subsequent ATC
   instructions when directed by the flight.
   3.13.6. Brevity code and other terminology will be according to AFTTP 3-2.5, Multi-Service
   Brevity Codes (FOUO).
3.14. Change of Aircraft Control. Positive control of the aircraft must be maintained at all
times. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement ―You have the aircraft.‖ The
pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge ―I have the aircraft.‖ Once assuming
control of the aircraft, the pilot will maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above. See
paragraph 6.12 for procedures after a birdstrike or canopy loss.
3.15. Formations (General):
   3.15.1. Flight or element leads will always consider wingman or element position and ability
   to safely perform a maneuver before directing it.
   3.15.2. The maximum flight size in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is four
   aircraft.
   3.15.3. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
   3.15.4. Use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals. A radio call is mandatory when directing position changes at night
   or under instrument conditions.
   3.15.5. Flight leads will not break up formations until each pilot has a positive fix from
   which to navigate; for example, visual, embedded GPS/inertial navigation system (INS)
   (EGI), TACAN, or very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR).
   3.15.6. When changing leads:
       3.15.6.1. During flight in limited visibility conditions (for example haze, night, or IMC),
       initiate lead changes from a stabilized, wings-level attitude.
       3.15.6.2. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation is 500 feet AGL
       over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water. In IMC, formation flights will not change lead
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    15


      or wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. (For night position
      changes, see paragraph 3.23.4 of this instruction.)
      3.15.6.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft than a normal
      fingertip or route position, or greater than 30 degrees aft from line abreast.
      3.15.6.4. Flight or element leads will not initiate a lead change unless the aircraft
      assuming the lead is in a position from which the lead change can be safely initiated and
      visual contact maintained.
      3.15.6.5. The lead change will be initiated by either visual signal or radio call (required
      at night or in IMC).
      3.15.6.6. Acknowledge receipt of the lead by a head nod or radio call, as appropriate.
      3.15.6.7. The lead change is effective on acknowledgment.
      3.15.6.8. The former lead then moves to the briefed wing position.
3.16. Tactical Formations:
   3.16.1. General. The following rules apply for flightpath deconfliction during tactical
   maneuvering:
      3.16.1.1. Wingmen must maneuver relative to the flight lead and maintain sight. Trailing
      aircraft or elements are responsible for deconflicting with lead aircraft or elements.
      3.16.1.2. At low altitude, wingman or elements will deconflict by going high relative to
      the flight lead's or element's plane of motion.
   3.16.2. Loss of Visual Contact. Use the following procedures when one or more flight
   members or elements lose visual contact within the formation:
      3.16.2.1. If any flight member or element calls ―blind,‖ the other flight member or
      element will immediately make an informative position call.
      3.16.2.2. If the other flight member or element is also blind, the ―blind‖ call will include
      altitude. The flight lead will take action to ensure altitude separation between flight
      members or elements. The flight lead will specify either AGL or MSL when directing the
      formation to deconflict. When directed to deconflict, a minimum of 500 feet of altitude
      separation will be used. Climbs and descents through the deconfliction altitude should be
      avoided, if possible.
      3.16.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original ―blind‖ call, the flight
      member or element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known position of
      the other flight member or element and alter his or her altitude. Repeat the blind call.
      3.16.2.4. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive
      action to ensure flightpath deconfliction within the flight to include a terminate or KIO if
      necessary. Scenario restrictions, such as sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks must
      be considered.
      3.16.2.5. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until a visual is regained and, if
      necessary, will navigate with altitude separation until mutual support is regained.
 16                                                      AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


   3.16.3. Two-Ship Formations. The following rules apply for flightpath deconfliction
   during tactical maneuvering of two-ship formations:
       3.16.3.1. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flightpath deconfliction.
       3.16.3.2. The flight lead becomes primarily responsible for deconfliction when:
          3.16.3.2.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader in the wingman's ―blind cone‖ or
          forces the wingman's primary attention away from the lead (for example, the
          wingman becomes the engaged fighter).
          3.16.3.2.2. The wingman calls ―blind‖ and receives an acknowledgment from the
          flight lead.
       3.16.3.3. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman once the
       wingman acknowledges a visual on his or her lead.
   3.16.4. Three- and Four-Ship Formations. When flights of more than two aircraft are in
   tactical formation:
       3.16.4.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight or element lead pertain only to
       the associated element unless briefed otherwise by the flight lead.
       3.16.4.2. Trailing aircraft or elements will maintain sufficient spacing so primary
       emphasis during formation maneuvering or turns is on altitude awareness and
       deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between elements.
3.17. Chase Formation:
   3.17.1. Any qualified pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or impending
   emergency conditions. Qualified stan/eval flight examiners (SEFE) may fly chase during
   flight evaluations.
   3.17.2. On transition sorties, the chase aircraft will perform a single-ship takeoff. In flight,
   the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but is primarily responsible for aircraft
   separation. The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. In the
   traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe performance.
   3.17.3. A safety observer in a chase aircraft will maneuver in a 30- to 60-degree cone out to
   1,000 feet from which the pilot can effectively clear and/or provide assistance.
3.18. Show Formation. These formations will be specifically briefed and flown according to
applicable directives. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, and applicable
MAJCOM directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in static
displays and aerial events.
3.19. Weather and IFR:
   3.19.1. Approach Category:
       3.19.1.1. The T-38 is approach category E. A missed approach will be accomplished
       according to flight manual procedures.
       3.19.1.2. Approach category D minimums may be used where no category E minimums
       are published if:
          3.19.1.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               17


         3.19.1.2.2. The aircraft is flown at a final approach airspeed of 165 knots indicated
         airspeed (KIAS) or less.
         3.19.1.2.3. The aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed (KTAS) or less for the
         missed approach segment of the approach. Note: At high pressure altitudes and
         temperatures, 260 KTAS may not be compatible with published missed approach
         airspeeds and category D approaches should not be flown.
  3.19.2. Takeoff and Join-Up. The flight lead must notify the appropriate ATC agency
  when a visual meteorological condition (VMC) join-up is not possible because of weather
  conditions or operational requirements. Coordinate for an appropriate altitude block or trail
  formation. Formation trail departures will comply with instructions for a nonstandard
  formation flight as defined in DoD FLIP. The flight lead should request transponder codes
  for wingmen in trail.
  3.19.3. Trail Procedures. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first
  priority and will not be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to
  the briefed airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If task saturation
  occurs, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument departure, and notify the flight
  lead. The flight lead will then notify ATC.
  3.19.4. Trail Departures:
     3.19.4.1. Use a minimum of 20-second takeoff spacing.
     3.19.4.2. Each aircraft or element will accelerate in AB power until reaching 250 KTS.
     Accelerate to 300 KTS in Military (MIL). Climb at 300 KTS using 600 degrees exhaust
     gas temperature (EGT), or as briefed, until reaching cruise Mach or cruise true airspeed
     (TAS), unless otherwise briefed. All turns will be made using 30 degrees of bank.
     3.19.4.3. The flight lead will call initiating all turns.
     3.19.4.4. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each
     5,000 foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up
     or level-off or until the following aircraft or element calls "visual." In addition, each
     aircraft or element will call initiating any altitude or heading change. Acknowledgments
     are not required, but it is imperative that preceding aircraft or elements monitor the radio
     transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft or elements and immediately
     correct deviations from the departure route or planned course.
     3.19.4.5. Each aircraft or element will use all available aircraft systems and navigational
     aids to monitor position.
     3.19.4.6. Each aircraft or element will maintain at least 1,000 feet of vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element during the climb or descent and at level-off until
     visual contact is established, except instances where departure instructions specifically
     prohibit compliance.
     3.19.4.7. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight lead will request 1,000 feet of altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or
     element if all aircraft can comply with minimum safe altitude (MSA) restrictions. If the
     MSA cannot be complied with, the 1,000-foot vertical separation may be reduced to 500
     feet.
18                                                    AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


  3.19.5. Formation Breakup. Formation breakup should not be accomplished in IMC.
  However, if it is unavoidable, breakup will be accomplished in straight-and-level flight. Prior
  to a weather breakup, the flight lead will transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude, and altimeter
  setting, which will be acknowledged by wingmen. Wingmen will also confirm good
  navigational aids according to paragraph 3.9.5 of this instruction.
  3.19.6. Formation Penetration:
     3.19.6.1. Formation penetrations are restricted to two aircraft when the weather at the
     base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
     3.19.6.2. If a formation landing is intended, the wingman should be positioned on the
     appropriate wing prior to weather penetration.
  3.19.7. Formation VMC Drag Procedures:
     3.19.7.1. A formation VMC drag maneuver may be used to establish spacing for single-
     ship landings when conditions do not permit a formation landing and the following
     conditions are met:
         3.19.7.1.1. Weather is at least a 1,500-foot ceiling and 3 miles visibility. All aircraft
         will maintain VMC from the drag point to landing.
         3.19.7.1.2. Prior to directing the formation VMC drag under IFR, the flight lead will
         coordinate with the appropriate ATC agency for nonstandard formation during the
         remainder of the approach.
         3.19.7.1.3. The wingmen may use briefed power settings and configurations
         (speedbrake, gear and flaps) to establish and maintain spacing. Wingmen will not fly
         below final approach speed and s-turns will not be used to gain or maintain separation
         while on final.
         3.19.7.1.4. Minimum spacing is 3,000 feet, or greater if briefed.
         3.19.7.1.5. The latest drag point must allow adequate time for the wingmen to
         establish the required separation and then for the flight lead to slow to final approach
         speed not later than 3 nm from the runway. On instrument final approaches, the drag
         is normally accomplished so as to establish separation prior to the final approach fix
         or glideslope intercept.
     3.19.7.2. Any time the spacing is in question, the wingman will go-around or execute the
     missed approach, notify air traffic control, and comply with local procedures. Note:
     Before using these procedures in flight, the briefing must include the information in
     paragraphs 4.7.1.3 through 4.7.1.5, and reference the specific traffic pattern or instrument
     approach procedure to be flown.
  3.19.8. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight must be conducted
  according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and requires a qualified safety observer in the aircraft or
  in a chase aircraft as follows:
     3.19.8.1. Safety observers may occupy either the front or rear cockpit of the T-38 during
     simulated instrument flight. Under these conditions, an operable intercom is required.
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  19


       3.19.8.2. Safety observers may occupy a chase aircraft. Under these conditions an
       operable communications radio is required. Chase aircraft may move into close formation
       on final if a formation landing is intended and the simulated instrument flight is
       terminated.
   3.19.9. Icing Restrictions. Do no fly in areas of known or reported icing. Climbs or
   descents through icing conditions more severe than forecast light rime are prohibited.
3.20. Low-Altitude Procedures (General):
   3.20.1. During briefings, emphasis will be placed on low altitude flight maneuvering and
   observation of terrain feature or obstacles along the route of flight. For low altitude training
   over water or featureless terrain, include specific emphasis on minimum altitudes and spatial
   disorientation.
   3.20.2. Low-altitude formation positions and tactics will be flown using MAJCOM guidance
   or AFMAN 11-251, Volume 1, or AFMAN 11-250, Volume 1, as guides.
   3.20.3. If flight leads are unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known
   vertical obstructions that are a factor to the route of flight, they will direct a climb no later
   than 3 nm prior to the obstacle to ensure vertical separation by 2 nm from the obstacle.
   3.20.4. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead.
   3.20.5. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain a positive G on the aircraft and do not
   exceed approximately 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to
   upright bunting maneuvers.
   3.20.6. The minimum airspeed for low-level navigation is 300 KTS.
   3.20.7. During low-altitude training, maintain a minimum of 500 feet above the highest
   terrain or obstacle within 1/2 nm of the aircraft. Set the altitude warning function to alert the
   pilot at no less than 90 percent of planned altitude during low-level operations.
   3.20.8. During all low-altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted
   attention, KIO, or emergencies (including any perceived loss of thrust) is to climb to RAA or
   a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL). If a birdstrike enters the cockpit and
   the aircraft loses a canopy, the pilot flying will immediately select MIL or MAX power on
   both engines and establish a climb away from the ground. The pilot not flying will be
   prepared to assume control if the pilot flying does not initiate a climb away from the ground.
   In this case, the pilot will change control of the aircraft according to paragraph 3.17 of this
   instruction.
3.21. Minimum Altitudes. A pilot’s minimum altitude will be determined and certified by the
unit commander according to AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 1, T-38 Aircrew Training. Pilots
participating in approved stepdown training programs will comply with the requirements and
restrictions of that program. The following minimum altitudes apply to low-level training unless
higher altitudes are specified by route restrictions or a training syllabus:
   3.21.1. For pilots who have not completed stepdown training and who are not designated for
   flights at lower altitudes, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL.
 20                                                     AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


   3.21.2. For night or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet above the highest
   obstacle within 5 nm of the course.
   3.21.3. Weather minimums for visual low-level training will be 1,500 feet and 3 miles for
   any route or area, as specified in FLIP (for military training routes), or as specified in unit
   publications, whichever is higher.
3.22. Low-Level Route and Area Abort Procedures:
   3.22.1. VMC route and area abort procedures are as follows:
      3.22.1.1. Maintain safe separation from the terrain.
      3.22.1.2. Comply with VFR altitude restrictions and squawk applicable transponder
      modes and codes.
      3.22.1.3. Maintain VMC at all times.
      3.22.1.4. Attempt contact with controlling agency, if required.
   3.22.2. IMC route and area abort procedures are as follows:
      3.22.2.1. Immediately climb to or above the computed RAA. (Reference paragraph
      2.3.3.3 of this instruction for computing RAA.)
      3.22.2.2. Maintain preplanned ground track. Execute appropriate lost wingman
      procedures, if necessary.
      3.22.2.3. If deviations from normal route or area procedures are required or if the RAA
      or MSA is higher than the vertical limits of the route or area, squawk emergency.
      3.22.2.4. Attempt contact with the appropriate ATC agency for an IFR clearance. If
      required to fly in IMC without an IFR clearance, cruise at appropriate VFR altitudes until
      IFR clearance is received.
3.23. Night Operational Procedures:
   3.23.1. Night Ground Operations. The anticollision (beacon) light may be turned to OFF
   and the position lights turned to DIM if they prove to be a distraction or create a hazard. Taxi
   spacing will be a minimum of 300 feet and on the taxiway center line. The landing-taxi light
   will normally be used during all night taxiing. (Exception: When the light might interfere
   with the vision of the pilot of an aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come
   to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared without the landing-taxi light.) For formation
   takeoffs, flight or element lead will turn the anticollision light to OFF and position lights to
   DIM when reaching the run up position on the runway. Wingmen will maintain the
   anticollision light to ON and position lights to BRIGHT for takeoffs, unless IMC will be
   encountered shortly after takeoff.
   3.23.2. Night Takeoff. During a night formation takeoff, brake release and gear retraction
   will be called on the radio. Following takeoff, each aircraft or element will climb on runway
   heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating turns, except where departure instructions
   specifically prohibit compliance or executing a night overhead traffic pattern.
   3.23.3. Night Join-Ups. Night join-ups are not authorized.
   3.23.4. Night Formation Procedures:
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 21


       3.23.4.1. When in positions other than fingertip or route, aircraft spacing will be
       maintained primarily by instruments, and/or timing, with visual reference secondary. If
       aircraft spacing cannot be ensured, an altitude separation (minimum of 1,000 feet) will be
       established. At all times, aircrews will cross-check instruments to ensure ground
       clearance.
       3.23.4.2. Do not change lead or wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on RADAR
       downwind. Lead changes and position changes will be called over the radio, and they
       should be initiated from a stabilized, wings-level attitude.
   3.23.5. Night Fingertip Position. Night fingertip formation is flown in approximately the
   same position as during the day. If illumination is insufficient to use day references, exterior
   lighting relationships may be used.
   3.23.6. Night Breakup. Prior to a night formation breakup, the flight lead will transmit
   attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be acknowledged by wingmen.
   Wingmen will also confirm good navigational aids. This procedure is not required for a
   formation breakup that occurs in the overhead traffic pattern.
3.24. Approaches and Landings:
   3.24.1. The desired touchdown point is 150 – 1,000 feet from the threshold for a VFR
   approach. When landing from a precision approach, touchdown may be beyond the VFR
   touchdown zone. When local procedures or unique runway surface conditions require landing
   beyond a given point on the runway, the desired touchdown point will be adjusted
   accordingly.
   3.24.2. Reduced same runway separation is authorized according to AFI 13-204, Volume 3,
   Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, as supplemented. When wake turbulence is
   expected due to calm winds or when landing with a light tail wind, spacing should be
   increased.
   3.24.3. If the altitude warning function is used for decision height awareness on instrument
   approaches, aircrews will set the data source for activation of the altitude warning function to
   ―MSL‖
3.25. Overhead Traffic Patterns:
   3.25.1. Overhead patterns can be made with unexpended practice ordnance.
   3.25.2. Initiate the break over the touchdown point or as directed.
   3.25.3. The break will be executed individually in a level 180-degree turn to the downwind
   leg at minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP or SEFE chase or when in tactical
   formation).
3.26. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted, using the following parameters:
   3.26.1. A maximum of four aircraft authorized in the formation.
   3.26.2. Lateral spacing of 4,000 to 6,000 feet.
   3.26.3. No more than 6,000 feet of element spacing.
 22                                                    AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


   3.26.4. If using an offset box formation, offset away from the direction of the break.
   3.26.5. The lead element will break to downwind abeam or over the touchdown point.
   3.26.6. The second element (or aircraft if three-ship formation) will delay a break to
   downwind until number 2 is clear of the intended flightpath.
   3.26.7. Use normal overhead altitude and airspeed.
   3.26.8. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing will be flown.
   3.26.9. The ATC agency must be familiar with the procedure to be flown.
3.27. Low Approaches:
   3.27.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
       3.27.1.1. For IPs or SEFEs flying chase position, 50 feet AGL.
       3.27.1.2. For formation low approaches, 100 feet AGL.
       3.27.1.3. For chase aircraft during an emergency, 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.27.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below a VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude
   until crossing the departure end of the runway (unless local procedures, missed approach,
   climbout procedures, or controller instructions dictate otherwise).
3.28. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed or cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. When in formation, a
sequential closed may be flown with ATC concurrence at an interval to ensure proper spacing.
Plan to arrive on downwind between 200 to 240 KTS.
3.29. Rear Cockpit Approaches and Landings:
   3.29.1. Only qualified IPs or those enrolled in a course of qualification leading to instructor
   certification, with an IP in the front cockpit, may perform rear cockpit landings.
   3.29.2. During rear cockpit approaches and landings, the front cockpit pilot will visually
   clear the area, monitor aircraft parameters and configurations, and be prepared to direct a go-
   around or take control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP), if necessary.
3.30. . Formation Approaches:
   3.30.1. Accomplish formation approaches from an instrument approach or a VFR straight-in
   approach, using precision approach path indicator (PAPI) or visual approach slope indicator
   (VASI) lights, if available. In all cases, use a rate of descent similar to that of a normal
   precision approach.
   3.30.2. The weather must be at least a 500-foot ceiling and 1 1/2 miles visibility, or the
   highest of any flight member’s weather category, whichever is higher.
   3.30.3. The maximum number of aircraft is two. Both aircraft must be similarly configured.
   Do not consider the weapon system support pod (WSSP) configurations. Non-propulsion
   modernization program (PMP) modified aircraft may fly formation approaches with PMP
   modified aircraft.
3.31. Formation Landings:
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             23


   3.31.1. A qualified flight lead must lead formation landings unless an IP or flight lead
   qualified squadron supervisor is in the element.
   3.31.2. The flight lead will position the wingman on the upwind side if the crosswind
   exceeds 5 knots. Do not land as a formation if the crosswind component, including gusts,
   exceeds 15 knots.
   3.31.3. The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing.
   3.31.4. If the wingman overruns the lead after landing, both pilots will accept the overrun,
   maintain the appropriate side of the runway, and maintain aircraft control. The wingman will
   not attempt to reposition behind the lead. The most important considerations are wingtip
   clearance and aircraft control.
   3.31.5. Formation landings are prohibited when the runway is reported wet or when ice,
   slush, or snow is on the runway.
   3.31.6. The minimum runway width for formation landings is 150 feet.
   3.31.7. Pilots will not land in formation:
      3.31.7.1. If arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the
      approach end of 150-foot wide runways.
      3.31.7.2. With a PMP aircraft on the wing of a non-PMP aircraft.
3.32. Landing Restrictions:
   3.32.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway, land at
   an alternate runway, if possible.
   3.32.2. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 10, land at an alternate
   runway, if possible.
   3.32.3. Do not land over any raised web barrier (for example, MA-1A, BAK-15).
   3.32.4. If the crosswind component, including gusts:
      3.32.4.1. Exceeds 15 knots (dry runway) or 10 knots (wet runway), solo undergraduate
      flying training (UFT) students will land at an alternate runway, if possible.
      3.32.4.2. Exceeds 15 knots, the minimum runway length for 60- and 100-percent flap
      touch-and-go’s on runways without a suitable barrier is 10,000 feet. Do not perform no-
      flap touch-and-go landings on runways without a suitable barrier when the crosswind
      component exceeds 15 knots.

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

6.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when abnormal circumstances occur. These
procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual.
   6.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction addressed in the emergency or
   abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective actions have
   been accomplished.
   6.1.2. Do not taxi an aircraft with nosewheel steering, brake system, canopy, or generator
   malfunctions or failures.
   6.1.3. Once a malfunctioning system is isolated and/or the fault corrected, the system will
   not be used again unless it is used in a degraded mode and is essential for recovery. Do not
   conduct ground or in-flight troubleshooting after flight manual emergency procedures are
   completed.
   6.1.4. Pilots will record all inadvertent supersonic events according to AFI 13-201, Airspace
   Management. Units will use AF Form 4290, Unplanned Supersonic Flight Activity Log, to
   record inadvertent supersonic events.
6.2. Ground Aborts:
   6.2.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, and the flight lead renumbers the flight to
   maintain a numerical call sign sequence, flight lead will advise the appropriate agencies of
   such changes.
   6.2.2. If the flight lead aborts, a flight of two or more aircraft with no designated flight lead
   in the formation must either sympathetically abort or proceed on prebriefed single-ship
   missions.
   6.2.3. Pilots who do not take off with the flight may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous
   point prior to a tactical event or may fly a briefed alternate single-ship mission. If a join-up is
   to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range, all events will be terminated until the joining
   aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
   6.2.4. The PIC is primarily responsible for handling in-flight emergencies. The additional
   pilot (if applicable) will confirm all critical action procedures have been accomplished and
   provide checklist assistance at the request of the PIC.
6.3. Takeoff Aborts:
   6.3.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, give the call sign and state intentions when
   practical. Following aircraft will alter their takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort the
   takeoff if adequate clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase ―barrier, barrier, barrier‖ will
   be used to direct the tower to raise the departure end barrier.
   6.3.2. When aborting, if hot brakes are suspected, declare a ground emergency. Taxi the
   aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake procedures.
6.4. Air Aborts:
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  27


   6.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   6.4.2. Aborting aircraft with an emergency condition will be escorted to the field of intended
   landing. When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an
   escort for the aborting aircraft is required.
   6.4.3. Regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, the mission will be
   aborted for any of the following:
      6.4.3.1. Birdstrike or foreign object damage.
      6.4.3.2. Over-G. The aircraft will land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach.
      6.4.3.3. Flight control system anomalies.
      6.4.3.4. Engine flameout, stagnation, or shutdown.
   6.4.4. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debriefing.
6.5. Radio Failure:
   6.5.1. Formation:
      6.5.1.1. A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will
      maneuver within close or route parameters to attract the attention of another flight
      member and give the appropriate visual signals. The mission should be terminated as
      soon as practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert
      base. A formation approach to a dropoff on final should be performed unless safety
      considerations dictate otherwise.
      6.5.1.2. If flying other than close or route formation when radio failure occurs, the
      NORDO aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on
      another flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances
      from other flight members until its presence is acknowledged by a wing rock, signifying
      clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
      signals. If prebriefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
      If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to
      the base of intended landing or a divert base. Aircraft experiencing any difficulty or
      emergency, in addition to NORDO, will proceed as required by the situation.
   6.5.2. Surface Attack NORDO Procedures:
      6.5.2.1. For class A and manned class B ranges:
          6.5.2.1.1. Attempt contact with the range control officer (RCO) on the appropriate
          backup frequency.
          6.5.2.1.2. If contact cannot be reestablished, make a pass by the range control tower
          on the attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. The
          flight lead will either rejoin the flight and return to base or direct another flight
          member to escort the NORDO to a recovery base.
          6.5.2.1.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
          tower (if practical) on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the
 28                                                    AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


          direction of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight
          member to join up and escort the emergency aircraft.
       6.5.2.2. For unmanned class B and class C ranges, make a pass on the target, if possible,
       while rocking wings. The leader will either rejoin the flight in sequence and recover or
       direct another flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base. If the
       NORDO has an emergency, it will (if practical) make a pass on the target, rock its wings,
       turn the opposite direction of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will
       direct a flight member to join up and escort the emergency aircraft.
       6.5.2.3. If radio failure occurs and circumstances prevent landing with unexpended
       ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished if the following conditions are
       met:
          6.5.2.3.1. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact
          with the RCO.
          6.5.2.3.2. Jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO
          aircraft to initiate jettison.
   6.5.3. NORDO Recovery. For a NORDO recovery, the procedures in AFI 11-205 and FLIP
   apply. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary, the
   chase will go around, pass the NORDO aircraft, and rock its wings. The NORDO aircraft
   will go around if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a wingman,
   the lead will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
6.6. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not attempt to fly through severe weather. However, if
severe weather is unavoidable, prior to severe weather penetration, flights should split up and
obtain separate clearances.
6.7. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential. On losing sight of the lead, the wingman will simultaneously execute
applicable lost wingman procedures while transitioning to instruments. Smooth application of
control inputs is imperative to minimize spatial disorientation effects. Once lost wingman
procedures have been executed, and the wingman regains visual, permission to rejoin the flight
must be obtained from the flight lead.
   6.7.1. For two- or three-ship flights, in wings-level flight (climb, descent, or straight and
   level) simultaneously inform the lead and turn away, using 15 degrees of bank for 15
   seconds. Then resume the heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       6.7.1.1. When outside the turn, reverse the direction of turn, using 15 degrees of bank for
       15 seconds and inform the lead. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
       resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
       6.7.1.2. When inside the turn, momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
       and inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral
       separation and obtain separate clearance. The lead may resume the turn only when
       separation is ensured. Note: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost wingman
       procedures (paragraph 6.7.2).
       6.7.1.3. For a precision or nonprecision final, the wingman will momentarily turn away
       to ensure separation, commence a climb, inform lead, proceed to the missed approach
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  29


       point, and carry out the published missed approach procedure while obtaining a separate
       clearance from approach control.
       6.7.1.4. For a missed approach, the wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
       separation, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
       procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. He or she will
       obtain a separate clearance from approach control.
   6.7.2. For four-ship flights, if only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures will provide safe separation. However, because it is impossible for number 4 to
   immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the lead, it is imperative that
   number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become
   separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined in paragraph 6.7.1. Number 4
   will follow the appropriate procedure as follows:
       6.7.2.1. For wings-level flight, simultaneously inform the lead and turn away, using 30
       degrees of bank for 30 seconds. Then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       6.7.2.2. When outside the turn, reverse direction of the turn, using 30 degrees of bank for
       30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3. Then obtain a separate
       clearance.
       6.7.2.3. When inside the turn, momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
       and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the lead to roll out. Obtain a separate
       clearance. The lead will resume the turn only when separation is ensured.
   6.7.3. The flight lead should acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call and transmit
   attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters, as appropriate. Care must be taken
   to observe published terrain clearance limits.
   6.7.4. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure, the aircraft
   with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance. The NORDO aircraft will turn the
   transponder to normal code 7600 while proceeding with the previous clearance. If an
   emergency situation arises along with radio failure, turn the transponder to Emergency for
   the remainder of the flight.
   6.7.5. Practice lost wingman procedures only in day VMC.
   6.7.6. With the flight lead's permission, wingmen may rejoin if weather conditions permit
   and a visual join-up can be accomplished.
6.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). Conditions that prevent a clear visual horizon or increase
pilot tasking are conducive to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot will make a conscious attempt to
increase his or her instrument cross-check rate. When SD symptoms are detected, the following
steps will be taken until symptoms abate:
   6.8.1. Single-Ship:
       6.8.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the attitude
       indicator. Use heads-down instruments. Defer nonessential cockpit tasks. If flying dual,
       transfer control to the other pilot.
 30                                                    AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


      6.8.1.2. If symptoms persist, bring the aircraft to straight-and-level flight with reference
      to the attitude indicator, conditions permitting. If the terrain permits, maintain a straight-
      and-level flight until symptoms abate, usually in 30 to 60 seconds.
      6.8.1.3. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC. Note: It is possible for SD
      to proceed to the point where the pilot is unable to see, interpret, or process information
      from the flight instruments. Aircraft control in such a situation is impossible. A pilot must
      recognize when physiological or psychological limits have been exceeded and be
      prepared to abandon the aircraft.
   6.8.2. Formation Lead:
      6.8.2.1. A flight lead experiencing SD will notify the wingmen. The flight lead will then
      comply with procedures in paragraph 7.8.1.
      6.8.2.2. If possible, wingmen should confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback to
      lead.
      6.8.2.3. If symptoms persist, the lead should terminate the mission and recover the flight
      by the simplest and safest means possible.
   6.8.3. Formation Wingman:
      6.8.3.1. The wingman will advise the lead when disorientation makes it difficult for the
      wingman to maintain his or her position.
      6.8.3.2. The lead will advise the wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and
      airspeed.
      6.8.3.3. If symptoms persist, the lead will establish a straight-and-level flight for 30 to 60
      seconds, conditions permitting.
      6.8.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective, the lead should consider passing the
      lead to the wingman, provided the leader will be able to maintain situational awareness
      from a chase position. Transfer lead while in straight-and-level flight. Once assuming the
      lead, the wingman will maintain straight-and-level flight for 60 seconds. If necessary,
      terminate the tactical mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
   6.8.4. Three- or Four-Ship Formation. The lead should separate the flight into elements to
   more effectively handle a wingman with persistent SD symptoms. Establish straight-and-
   level flight according to paragraph 4.5 of this instruction. The element with the SD pilot will
   remain straight and level while the other element separates from the flight.
6.9. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures:
   6.9.1. A simulated emergency procedure is a procedure that produces an effect that would
   closely parallel the actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to a degree that produces
   a drag equivalent to a flamed out or idle engine.
   6.9.2. All training related to aborted takeoffs will be accomplished in the flight simulator,
   cockpit familiarization trainer (CFT), or static aircraft.
   6.9.3. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited except for functional check flight
   (FCF) training requirements.
AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               31


   6.9.4. Refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and applicable MAJCOM supplements for
   emergency landing patterns.
6.10. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. If an aircraft is lost in flight, actions must
immediately begin to locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. All flight members
must aggressively pursue location and rescue of downed personnel, even if they seem uninjured.
Many downed aircrews initially suffer from shock or have delayed reactions to ejection injuries.
The following procedures are by no means complete and should be adjusted to meet each unique
SAR situation: (Note: Specific procedures will be detailed in the unit local supplement.)
   6.10.1. Squawk. Immediately terminate maneuvering, using appropriate KIO procedures.
   Establish a SAR commander. Place the transponder in to Emergency to alert ATC or ground
   control intercept (GCI) of the emergency situation.
   6.10.2. Talk. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft or flight intentions
   immediately to applicable control agencies. Use Guard frequency if necessary. Do not use
   aircrew names on the radio; individual crew positions may be referenced by using the call
   sign and the suffix ―ALPHA‖ to refer to the front cockpit occupant and ―BRAVO‖ to refer to
   the rear cockpit occupant (for example, ―Randy 04-ALPHA‖ or ―Randy 04-BRAVO‖).
   6.10.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivors or crash site, using any means
   available. Use the VOR, TACAN, or INS position; ATC or GCI positioning; or ground
   references to identify the immediate area for subsequent rescue efforts.
   6.10.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of
   all possible survivors is determined. As a guide, allow 1 minute per 1,000 feet for a deployed
   parachute to descend. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in the SAR by altitude to prevent a
   midair collision. Establish high or low combat air patrol (CAP), as necessary, to facilitate
   communications with other agencies.
   6.10.5. Bingo. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum SAR
   coverage over survivors or crash site. Do not overfly bingo fuel. Relinquish SAR operation to
   designated rescue forces on their arrival.
6.11. Solo Student Restrictions (UFT only):
   6.11.1. Do not perform the following:
       6.11.1.1. Traffic pattern stalls, approach to stalls, and slow flight.
       6.11.1.2. Advanced handling characteristics maneuvers.
       6.11.1.3. Practice nose high and low recoveries.
       6.11.1.4. Practice lost wingman as wing.
       6.11.1.5. Rolling takeoffs.
       6.11.1.6. Practice emergency patterns and landings.
       6.11.1.7. Low closed or circling approaches.
       6.11.1.8. Formation landings.
       6.11.1.9. Takeoffs with crosswinds (including gusts) greater than 15 knots, or landings
       with crosswinds (including gusts) greater than 15 knots (dry) or 10 knots (wet).
 32                                                      AFI11-2T-38V3 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


      6.11.1.10. Patterns and landings with more than 2,500 pounds of fuel.
      6.11.1.11. Flight in an aircraft with any known malfunction or requiring an operational
      check (EXCEPTION: Inoperative instrumentation in the rear cockpit).
      6.11.1.12. Any unbriefed maneuver.
      6.11.1.13. On the wing of another solo student.
      6.11.1.14. Formation low approaches below 300 feet AGL.
   6.11.2. Solo student minimum fuel is 800 pounds.
   6.11.3. Post-contact checkride solo students may climb and descend through IMC if the
   ceiling is at or above 5,000 feet AGL and not more than 2,000 feet thick. Minimum in-flight
   visibility above and below the ceiling is 5 miles. Solo students will not level off or cruise in
   any IMC.
6.12. Birdstrike and Loss of Canopy Procedures:
   6.12.1. Following any birdstrike that enters the cockpit, or loss of canopy, there is high
   potential for extreme confusion and disorientation. Pilots must use extreme care to avoid
   situations resulting in both crewmembers attempting to fly the aircraft at the same time.
   6.12.2. The crewmember with the intact canopy must be prepared to assume or maintain
   control of the aircraft. The pilot flying prior to the birdstrike or loss of canopy will maintain
   aircraft control (if able) until a positive transfer of aircraft control has occurred. The pilot not
   flying will monitor flight parameters and be ready to immediately assume control if the pilot
   flying is not responding appropriately (by initiating a climb if in the low-altitude
   environment).
   6.12.3. If the aircraft is at low altitude when the birdstrike or canopy loss occurs, the pilot
   flying will (if able) immediately select MIL or MAX power on both engines and establish a
   climb away from the ground. The pilot not flying will be prepared to assume control of the
   aircraft if the pilot flying does not initiate a climb away from the ground.
   6.12.4. In the case of a birdstrike that has entered the cockpit or canopy loss with a
   corresponding loss of intercom or communication difficulty, the pilot assuming control of the
   aircraft will shake the stick, and the pilot relinquishing control will show his/her hands, if
   able, unless prebriefed otherwise. (See paragraph 3.14.)
6.13. Nonpilot Aircrew Flying. MAJCOMs may establish procedures and restrictions for
nonpilot aircrew member control of the aircraft.

 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4290, UNPLANNED SUPERSONIC FLIGHT
                           ACTIVITY LOG

A2.1. Purpose. Units use the AF Form 4290 to document unplanned supersonic flights
