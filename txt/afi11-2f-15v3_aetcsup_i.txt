SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2004-1. This IC removes all AETC-specific
information (including references to 19th Air Force) from the instruction. (AETC will issue a
standalone supplement.) IC 2004-1 is the last attachment of this publication. A bar ( | ) indicates
a change from the previous revision.

(AETC) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include guidance on in-flight checklist usage, additional RCR restriction for takeoffs,
removal of rolling takeoff restriction, restriction of ACBT with malfunctioning g-suit, and
standardization with other Combat Air Forces 11-2MDS volume 3s for g-awareness, VMC drag,
Pilot Weather Categories, and Instrument Flight Rules.

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the proce-dures applicable to the safe operation of the
   F-15. With the complementary references, this instruction prescribes standard operational
   pro-cedures for all USAF F-15 pilots. This publication applies to FAP AFRC pilots.
   1.1.2. Pilot Responsibility. This instruction, in conjunction with other governing directives,
   prescribes procedures for operating F-15 aircraft under most circumstances. It is not a
   substitute for sound judgment. Procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if
   they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.
   1.1.3. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of the
   MAJCOM/DO (ANG/XO) unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates
   otherwise. In that case, the pilot in command will take the appropriate action to safely
   recover the aircraft.
   1.1.4. References. The primary references for F-15 operations are T.O.s 1F-15A-1, 1F-
   15A-1-1,1F-15C-34-1-3, AFTTP 3-1 and AFTTP 3-3, AFI 11-214, Aircrew and Weapons
   Director Procedures for Air Operations, and this instruction. Training units may develop
   phase manuals from the procedures contained in these documents. Phase manuals may
   expand on basic procedures but in no case will they be less restrictive. Operational units may
   use these phase manuals.
1.2. Waivers. Forward waiver requests through appropriate channels to the applicable
MAJCOM/DO (ANG/XO) for approval. Approved waivers are issued for a maximum of one
year from the effective date. Provide information copies of approved waivers to the lead and user
MAJCOM OPRs for this instruction.
1.2. (AETC)Waivers. HQ AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority unless otherwise specified in
this supplement. Send waiver requests through stan/eval channels to HQ AETC/A3V. The
operations group commander (OG/CC), or equivalent, of the unit that generated their supplement
will handle waivers to supplemental guidance.
1.3. Instruction Changes.
   1.3.1. Submit recommendations for change to this instruction on an AF Form 847,
   Recommendation for Change of Publication to the parent MAJCOM. MAJCOMs forward
   approved recommendations to HQ ACC/DOTO. HQ USAF/XO is the approval authority for
   interim changes to this instruction.
1.4. Distribution. Each F-15 pilot is authorized a copy of this instruction.

                                            Chapter 2

                                      MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members and the operations and intelligence functions of fighter organizations.
2.2. General Procedures.
     2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment to
     include fuel requirements, map preparation, and takeoff/landing data.
        2.2.1.1. (PACAF) Fly planned over water flights outside the local training area (i.e.,
        deployments, cross countries, PDM inputs, etc.) as a two-ship minimum. OG/CC may
        approve single-ship missions.
        2.2.1.2. (PACAF, USAFE) Load captive training missiles (CATMs), live missiles and
        ACMI pods symmetrically whenever possible. If necessary, use a left wing heavy
        configuration due to gun placement. Be aware that fuel imbalances of less than 200
        lbs, coupled with asymmetric missile/pod loads can put the F-15 into a departure
        susceptible regime.
        2.2.1.3. (USAFE) In addition, when applicable, pilots will consult the following for
        mission planning:
            2.2.1.3.1. DOD FLIP Planning Europe, Africa, And Middle East.
            2.2.1.3.2. UK Military Low Fly Handbook.
            2.2.1.3.3. UK Low Fly NOTAMS.
            2.2.1.3.4. UK Royal Flights.
            2.2.1.3.5. USAFEI 11-202, Control Off-Station Sorties/Diverts.
            2.2.1.3.6. ASRR, Airfield Suitability Report/Summary Airfield Restrictions.
            2.2.1.3.7. AFI 13-212, volume 1/USAFE 1, USAFE Range Procedures.
            2.2.1.3.8. AFPAM 11-216 Air Navigation
2.3. Map/Chart Preparation.
     2.3.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if the unit pilot aid includes
     jettison areas, divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provides a local area map of
     sufficient detail to remain within assigned training areas.
        2.3.1.1. (USAFE) On flights from a deployed location, each aircrew will have
        available a local map annotated with designated flying areas, emergency airfields,
        buffer zones, control zones, and restricted or danger areas if this information is not
        available in the aircrew aid.
     2.3.2. Charts. FLIP enroute charts may be used in-stead of maps on navigational flights
     within areas that are adequately covered by these charts.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                             9


       2.3.2.1. (USAFE) Pilots may use UK Enroute Low Charts to supplement US DoD
       Enroute Low charts as deemed necessary. Aircrew will reference UK Flight
       Information Handbook for index and chart definitions contained on UK Enroute Low
       chart.
   2.3.3. Low Altitude Maps.
       2.3.3.1. On low altitude flights (LOWAT syllabus rides, military training routes, VR
       routes), each aircraft in the flight will contain a minimum of one CHUMed map of the
       low altitude route/operating area. The map will be of a scale and quality that terrain
       features, hazards, and chart annotations are of suffi-cient detail to allow navigation and
       safe mission accomplishment.
       2.3.3.2. Highlight all man-made obstacles at or above the planned flight altitude.
       Additionally, annotate low-level maps with time and/or distance tick-marks to ensure
       positive positional awareness of obstacles along the planned route of flight plus or minus
       5 NM.
       2.3.3.3. Annotate all maps with a route abort altitude (RAA). Compute the RAA, for the
       entire route/area, at a minimum of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle/terrain feature
       (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within the lateral limits of the route or training area, but
       in no case less than 5 NM either side of planned route. Minimum Safe Altitudes (MSA)
       may be used for specific legs of a route.
       2.3.3.4. Aircrew members flying under VFR or inside MTRs in CONUS will supplement
       existing mission planning materials (e.g. CHUM, FLIP AP/1B, etc.) With either:
          2.3.3.4.1. PFPS/Falcon View with the following overlay options selected:
          airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways, MTR, parachute jump and SUAs
          boundaries; or
          2.3.3.4.2. Sectional aeronautical charts.
       2.3.3.5. Low level charts and route books used during flight will be annotated with
       location and dimensions of class A/B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields and other
       potential high density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultra light/hang
       glider/glider sites, etc.) Within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or MTR lateral
       boundary. Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class
       A/B/C/D airspace will be annotated and briefed on all such flights. In addition, annotate
       and brief the intersection of other VR/IR routes (if applicable) and any other possible
       areas of conflict.
       2.3.3.6. Use of sectional aeronautical charts in flight is not required.
       2.3.3.7. Aircrew members flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater
       or host nation guidance on mission planning. If no gaining MAJCOM, theater or host
       nation guidance exists, use the best charts or Falcon View overlay options available to
       accomplish the requirements of paragraph 2.3.3.5.
2.4. Briefing/Debriefing.
   2.4.1. Briefings. Flight leaders are responsible for presenting a logical briefing that will
   promote safe, effective mission accomplishment.
10                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


     2.4.1.1. All pilots/crewmembers/passengers must attend the flight briefing unless
     previously coordinated with unit supervisors. Anyone not attending the flight brief must
     receive a briefing on mission events and emergency procedures.
     2.4.1.2. Briefers will reference applicable portions of briefing guides. Items listed may
     be briefed in any sequence. Those items understood by all participants may be briefed as
     “standard.” Specific items not pertinent to the mission do not need to be covered.
     2.4.1.3. Takeoff and landing data (TOLD) will be annotated on mission data cards. The
     minimum TOLD required is maximum abort speed (dry/wet), takeoff distance and speed,
     rotation speed, single engine takeoff speed (SETOS), and normal/heavy weight landing
     distance (dry/wet).
     2.4.1.4. Review takeoff data, and ensure every member of the flight understands it. Place
     particular emphasis on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations such as
     short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, non-standard cable configurations, and abort
     sequence in formation flights.
     2.4.1.5. When dissimilar aircraft are flown in formation, brief flight responsibilities,
     proper formation position (to ensure adequate wingtip clearance), and aircraft-unique
     requirements for each phase of flight.
     2.4.1.6. For all low-level mission briefings, place emphasis on obstacle/ground
     avoidance, altitude-warning features (low altitude warning tone) low altitude comfort
     level, and complacency avoidance.
     2.4.1.7. Start briefings at least 1.5 hours before scheduled takeoff. Start alert briefings in
     sufficient time to be completed prior to pilot change-over.
     2.4.1.8. Structure flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each flight member.
     2.4.1.9. Brief an appropriate alternate mission for each flight. The alternate mission must
     be less complex than the primary unless Wings have developed and published standard
     alternate mission profiles. The one exception to this rule is that ACM (perch and cap „n‟
     tap) may be briefed as an alternate mission from a BFM surge brief. Brief specific
     mission elements different than the primary mission or published profiles. Mission
     elements/events may be modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not
     compromised. Flight leads will ensure all flight members acknowledge changes. Do not
     fly unbriefed missions/events.
     2.4.1.10. All missions will be debriefed.
  2.4.2. Deployed Operations, Exercise, and Quick Turn Briefings. If all flight members
  attend an initial or mass flight briefing, the flight lead on subsequent flights need brief only
  those items that have changed from the previous flight(s).
     2.4.2.1. (PACAF, USAFE) On multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow
     follow-on mission brief(s) and only the initial flight brief is accomplished for all goes,
     the following guidance applies:
         2.4.2.1.1. (PACAF, USAFE) Upgrade missions will be planned for the first sortie
         flown. Subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity with no upgrade
         training planned without OG/CC approval.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                            11


          2.4.2.1.2. (PACAF, USAFE) Participants in continuation training missions may
          fly their primary or alternate missions in any sequence.
   2.4.3. Briefing Guides. Mission briefing guides are contained in the Attachments. Units
   may augment these guides as necessary. Pending development by a higher headquarters,
   units that fly missions not covered by this instruction or its supplements will develop briefing
   guides for those missions and submit them to MAJCOM/DOT (ANG/XOOC) for review.
2.5. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids/Forms.
   2.5.1. Unit developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight manual checklists provided
   they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the applicable
   checklist.
   2.5.2. Units will produce a pilot aid that, as a minimum, includes:
       2.5.2.1. Briefing Guides.
       2.5.2.2. Local radio channelization and air-field diagrams.
       2.5.2.3. Impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists, and NORDO/divert
       information.
       2.5.2.4. Arresting gear information for divert bases.
       2.5.2.5. Bailout and Jettison Areas.
       2.5.2.6. Cross-country procedures to include: command                and     control,   engine
       documentation, JOAP samples, and aircraft servicing.
       2.5.2.7. Other information as deemed necessary by the units. For example: stereo flight
       plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas, instrument preflight, and alert
       procedures.
       2.5.2.8. Forms will be developed IAW AFI 37-160V8, The Air Force Publications and
       Forms Management Program - Developing and Processing Forms.
   2.5.3. (Added-AETC) For standardization purposes and management control, all pilots will
   maintain/update any issued checklists (to include unit developed and local pilot aids) that
   have been submitted and approved IAW AFI 11-215 AETC Sup. All pilots will carry the unit
   developed checklist/local pilot aid (if issued) and the 1F-15A-1CL-1 and 1F-15C-34-1-3CL-
   1 checklists when conducting flying operations.
2.6. Stowing Equipment in Bay 5. Stow containers or baggage with hard sides inside a Bay 5
cargo container. Without a cargo container, stow only locally manufactured fabric intake covers
and soft-sided personal equipment baggage, such as hang-up or A-3 bags, in Bay 5. Items stowed
in Bay 5 will be:
   2.6.1. Positioned 1 foot aft of the top of the canopy thruster “catcher‟s mitt.”
   2.6.2. Forward of the trailing edge of the aft circuit breaker panel on the right wall of Bay 5
   (do not interfere with ICS cables).
   2.6.3. Below the top of the circuit breaker panels on the right wall of Bay 5.
   2.6.4. Secured with non-stretchable cord in such a manner to prevent movement in all three
   axes of motion. Place aircraft safety equipment and egress pins in locally manufactured
 12                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


   fabric bags and stow in panels 154L, 35, 47L and R or in the cockpit map case. The pilot is
   responsible for ensuring items stowed in Bay 5 are loaded correctly and properly secured.
   The carriage restrictions for the Bay 5 cargo container are identical to the MXU-648/A cargo
   pod except for the airspeed restriction, which does not apply. This guidance does not
   preclude the pilot from taking any action necessary for safety of flight. Pilots will comply
   with the following restrictions:
      2.6.4.1. Aircraft with items stowed in Bay 5, with or without a cargo container, are
      restricted from performing aerobatics.
      2.6.4.2. Aircraft with items stowed in Bay 5, with or without a cargo container, are
      limited to Tactical Intercept missions restricted to LIMITED maneuvering. At no time
      during the flight will the pilot execute zero or negative G maneuvers unless safety of
      flight dictates.
2.7. G-suit/Combat Edge Use. IAW AFI 11-301 Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program, the
following apply:
   2.7.1. G-suit is required during all flights when 2 or more Gs are anticipated
   2.7.2. COMBAT EDGE is required on all flights where 6 Gs or more are pre-
   planned/anticipated.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                            13

                           NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Ground Communications. The pilot will accomplish the ground crew briefing (when
required) in accordance with the briefing guide contained in this instruction. Prior to starting the
JFS in a B/D model with the RCP occupied, the pilot will get an “OK” signal from the rear
cockpit occupant. Normally, the pilot and ground crew will communicate using the intercom
during all engine start and pre-taxi checks. Use the intercom system, to the maximum extent
possible, anytime aircraft engines are operating and maintenance technicians are performing
tasks on the aircraft. Units with active air defense commitments may waive the use of intercom
during alert scrambles.
   3.1.1. During the After Engine Start flight control checks, confirm the proper movement and
   position of the flight control surfaces with the crew chief.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI
11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. All signals
pertaining to operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot. The crew chief will repeat
the given signals when it is safe to operate the system. The pilot should not activate any system
that could pose danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment from
ground personnel. The following signals augment AFI 11-218.
   3.2.1. JFS START. With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling motion.
   3.2.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CHECK. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring motion.
   3.2.3. BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm hori-zontal, open hand and push forward,
   breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
   3.2.4. EEC/DEEC Check. With the fingers and thumb of each hand extended and joined at
   the tips, open and close the fingers and thumbs of both hands simultaneously, simulating
   nozzle opening and closing.
   3.2.5. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tailhook.
   3.2.6. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
   simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no).
3.3. Preflight. Do not carry baggage/equipment in an unoccupied F-15B/D rear cockpit
(EXCEPTION: forms/maps may be stowed in the map case).
   3.3.1. (USAFE) Aircraft Equipment Requirements. In addition to the requirements of
   AFI 11-202V3 and flight information publications (FLIP), the following equipment will be
   operative for all flights:
       3.3.1.1. (USAFE) Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) - fully operational.
       3.3.1.2. (USAFE) Inertial navigation system (INS), and for night and IMC the
       attitude heading reference system (AHRS) must be fully operational.
       3.3.1.3. (USAFE) Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature
       (IFF/SIF), Mode 3A and C.
 14                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


3.4. Ground Operations.
   3.4.1. The minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail. Spacing may be
   reduced when holding short of or entering the runway.
   3.4.2. Do not taxi during snow and/or icy conditions until the taxi route and runway have
   been checked for safe conditions. In this case, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300
   feet spacing.
       3.4.2.1. (USAFE) Minimum runway condition reading (RCR) on taxiways for taxi
       operations is RCR 10.
   3.4.3. Maximum taxi speed during sharp turns is 10 knots. Above 10 knots the aircraft may
   skid and/or depart the three-point attitude.
   3.4.4. Quick Check and Arming. Keep hands in view of ground personnel during quick
   check, arming or dearming operations. If the intercom system is not used during EOR
   checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with the ground personnel to
   allow the use of visual signals.
       3.4.4.1. (USAFE) Perform an end of runway inspection immediately before takeoff at
       all USAF bases. At non-USAF bases, the pilot will make every attempt to coordinate an
       EOR inspection with the host maintenance unit.
   3.4.5. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing ordnance.
3.5. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up as appro-priate based on weather conditions, runway
condi-tions, and runway width. Use a minimum of 500 feet spacing between separated
elements/flights. For formation takeoffs, wingmen must maintain wingtip clearance with their
element leader. If runway width precludes line-up with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in
the flight, use 500 feet spacing between elements or delay run-up until the preceding
aircraft/element releases brakes.
3.6. Before Takeoff Checks. Just prior to takeoff, all flight members will inspect each other for
proper configuration and any abnormalities. Wingmen will indicate they are ready for takeoff by
a head nod, radio call, or landing/taxi light signal.
3.7. Takeoff.
   3.7.1. Per MAJCOM guidance, OG/CC may waive RCR minimum for specified units
   operating in cold weather locations, but in no case will takeoffs be conducted with an RCR of
   less than 8.
       3.7.1.1. (ACC/ANG) Do not takeoff if the RCR is less than 12.
       3.7.1.1. (AETC) Do not takeoff if the RCR is less than 12.
   3.7.2. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway. For single ship takeoffs, if the single ship computed military power
   takeoff distance exceeds one-half of the available runway, takeoff using afterburner.
   3.7.3. When operating from airfields equipped with a compatible, remotely operated cable,
   ensure the departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and land-ings, unless another
   departure end cable is in place.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                         15


   3.7.3. (AETC) Aircraft will take off toward a compatible arresting system when the
   minimum go or continuation speed exceeds maximum abort speed.
      3.7.3.1. DELETED.
   3.7.4. Use a minimum of 10 seconds (15 seconds when using afterburners) takeoff interval
   between aircraft/elements. When joining “on top” use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff
   interval.
   3.7.5. Aircraft/elements will steer toward the center of the runway at the start of the takeoff
   roll.
   3.7.6. During rolling takeoffs, align the aircraft with the runway heading prior to advancing
   the throttles.
      3.7.6.1. DELETED.
   3.7.7. Wing/Group Commander or Ops Group Commander (SOF for ANG) may approve
   intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate.
   3.7.8. DELETED.
   3.7.9. (Added-AETC) For all takeoffs and landings, use crosswind and runway condition
   reading limits from the aircraft technical order (TO) or aircraft-specific guidance, whichever
   is more restrictive.
3.8. Formation Takeoff.
   3.8.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two aircraft.
   3.8.2. A qualified flight leader must lead a formation takeoff unless an IP or flight lead
   qualified squadron supervisor is in the element.
   3.8.3. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds weight of each other and symmetrically loaded.
   Consider symmetrically loaded as those store loadings that do not require an abnormal trim
   or control application to counter a roll or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb
   airspeed.
   3.8.4. For rolling formation takeoffs, the wingman must be properly aligned on the runway
   prior to the flight lead advancing the throttle for takeoff.
   3.8.4. (AETC) Rolling formation takeoffs are not authorized.
      3.8.4.1. DELETED.
      3.8.4.2. (USAFE) Rolling formation takeoffs are not authorized.
   3.8.5. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
      3.8.5.1. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
      3.8.5.2. There is standing water, ice, slush, or snow on the runway.
          3.8.5.2.1. (PACAF) The 3OG/CC may approve formation events provided that at
          least 125 feet of the runway width are cleared of snow, slush, ice or standing water.
      3.8.5.3. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.

      3.8.5.4. Loaded with live munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles, 20mm ammunition,
      and chaff/ flares).
      3.8.5.5. Ferrying aircraft from a contractor or AFMC facilities.
      3.8.5.6. The computed takeoff roll exceeds 50% of the available runway.
3.9. Join-up/Rejoin.
   3.9.1. Day weather criteria for a VFR join-up underneath: ceiling 1,500 feet and visibility 3
   miles.
   3.9.2. Flight leaders will maintain 350 KCAS until join-up is accomplished unless mission
   requirements necessitate a different airspeed.
   3.9.3. Flight leaders should limit their angle of bank to 30 degrees for turning rejoins
   immediately after takeoff.
   3.9.4. Flight members will join in sequence. For a straight-ahead rejoin, the number two
   aircraft will join on the left wing and the element will join on the right wing. For a turning
   rejoin, the number two aircraft will rejoin on the inside of the turn and the element to the
   outside. If mission or flight requirements dictate, the flight leader will specifically direct the
   desired for-mation positions.
   3.9.5. Battle Damage Checks. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle
   damage check after each mission prior to or during RTB. Except at night/IMC, this check is
   mandatory following the expenditure of any ordnance (including all types of 20mm
   ammunition). Brief deconfliction responsibilities and position change procedures. Fly no
   closer than fingertip formation spacing.
   3.9.6. For further join-up procedures, see Night Joinup (3.20.3) and Chapter 4.
3.10. Formation, General.
   3.10.1. In IMC, the maximum flight size in close/route formation is four aircraft except
   when flying in close formation with a tanker.
   3.10.2. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
   3.10.3. Airborne visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals. For four-ship flights, configuration changes will be initiated by
   radio call, when practical. When formation position changes are directed by radio, all
   wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is mandatory when
   directing position changes at night or under instrument conditions.
   3.10.4. Flight leaders will not break up formations until each wingman has a positive fix
   from which to navigate (visual, radar, INS, or TACAN).
   3.10.5. Changing Leads.
      3.10.5.1. When flying in limited visibility conditions, initiate lead changes from a
      stabilized, wings level attitude.
      3.10.5.2. The minimum altitude for a lead change is 500 feet AGL over land or 1,000
      feet AGL over water (for night see paragraph 3.20.4, for IMC see paragraph 4.6)
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                          17


      3.10.5.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft than 30 degrees from
      line abreast.
      3.10.5.4. Flight/element leads will not initiate a lead change unless the aircraft assuming
      the lead is in visual contact and in a safe position to do so.
      3.10.5.5. Initiate a lead change by visual signal or radio call.
      3.10.5.6. Acknowledge receipt of the lead by head nod or radio call, as appropriate.
      3.10.5.7. A lead change is effective upon acknowledgment.
      3.10.5.8. The former leader then moves to the appropriate wing position.
   3.10.6. (PACAF, USAFE) The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions,
   regardless of the physical position in which he flies. Wingmen should always be prepared
   to fly the number one position if, in the judgment of the flight lead, such action is
   warranted.
   3.10.7. (USAFE) Pilots who are not flight leads may lead limited portions of missions
   provided an instructor pilot (IP) or squadron supervisor is in the same element.
   3.10.8. Dissimilar Formations. Dissimilar aircraft may be flown in the same formation if
   mission requirements dictate or to expedite traffic flow during departures and recoveries.
   Specific procedures will be thoroughly prebriefed.
3.11. Tactical Formation.
   3.11.1. General. Apply the following rules for flight path deconfliction during tactical
   maneuver-ing:
      3.11.1.1. Flight/element leads will consider wingman/element position and ability to
      safely perform a maneuver before directing it.
      3.11.1.2. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight lead/lead element and
      maintain sight. Trailing aircraft/elements are responsible for deconflicting with lead
      aircraft/elements.
      3.11.1.3. Wingmen/elements will cross above the lead/lead element when deconfliction
      is required.
   3.11.2. Loss of Visual. Use the following procedures when one or more flight
   members/elements lose visual contact within the formation:
      3.11.2.1. When any flight member/element calls “Blind,” then the appropriate flight
      member/element will immediately respond with “Visual” and a position report or
      “Blind.”
      3.11.2.2. When the other flight member/element is also “Blind,” that pilot will transmit
      his altitude as an immediate action to deconflict flight paths. The flight lead will ensure a
      minimum of 500 feet altitude separation is maintained. Avoid climbs/descents through
      the deconfliction altitude when possible.
      3.11.2.3. When there is not a timely acknowledgment of the original “Blind” call, then
      the flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known
      position of the other flight member/element and alter altitude.
 18                                        AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


      3.11.2.4. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight leader will take additional
      positive action to ensure flight path deconfliction within the flight to include a
      Terminate/Knock-It-Off call if necessary. Consider scenario restrictions such as
      sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks.
      3.11.2.5. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until a visual is regained and, if
      necessary, will navigate with altitude separation until mutual support is regained.
   3.11.3. Two-Ship. The following rules apply for flight path deconfliction during tactical
   maneuvering of two-ship formations:
      3.11.3.1. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction.
      3.11.3.2. The flight lead becomes responsible for deconfliction when:
          3.11.3.2.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader in the wingman‟s “blind cone” or
          forces the wingman‟s primary attention away from the leader (for example, wingman
          becomes the engaged fighter, or from a wingman trail position the flight lead directs a
          180 turn).
          3.11.3.2.2. The wingman calls “blind.”
          3.11.3.2.3. Deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman once the
          wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead.
   3.11.4. Three/Four-Ship (or greater). When flights of more than two aircraft are in
   tactical formation:
      3.11.4.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight/element leader pertain only to
      the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight leader.
      3.11.4.2. Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary
      emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns is on low altitude awareness and
      deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between elements.
3.12. Chase Formation.
   3.12.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. Qualified pilots (including IQT/MQT pilots who have
   successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer
   for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized
   missions (i.e., OT&E, WSEP, live weapons delivery, etc.) and training conducted IAW AFI
   11-2F-15, Volume 1, F-15 Aircrew Training, may be chased by CMR/BMC pilots designated
   by Group/Squadron Commanders. All other chase events may only be flown by IP/FEs or
   upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP.
   3.12.2. Procedures:
      3.12.2.1. A safety observer in a chase aircraft, except IP/FE/specialized mission chase,
      will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail clearance to 1,000 feet, to effectively
      clear and/or provide assistance.
      3.12.2.2. IP/FE/specialized mission aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must
      maintain nose/tail separation until required to transition to close formation when deemed
      necessary by the IP/FE.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                          19


       3.12.2.3. No chase aircraft will stack lower than the lead aircraft when below 1,000 feet
       AGL.
3.13. Show Formation. Brief and fly show formations as approved. Refer to AFI 11-209, Air
Force Participation in Aerial Events, and applicable MAJCOM directives for spe-cific rules and
appropriate approval levels to participate in static displays and aerial events.
3.14. Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.14.1. Minimum Altitudes. For aerobatics, remain above 5,000 feet AGL. During nose
   high/low speed and AHC vertical maneuvering ensure maneuvers are terminated to allow
   recovery above 5,000 feet AGL.
   3.14.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices and jetwash. If it is unavoidable, immediately
   unload the aircraft to approximately 1 G.
   3.14.3. Do not extend flaps to improve aircraft maneuvering performance during ACBT.
3.15. Ops Checks.
   3.15.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment.
   Additionally, each pilot should monitor the fuel system carefully throughout the flight to
   identify low fuel, trapped fuel or out of balance situations as soon as possible. Ops checks are
   required:
       3.15.1.1. During climb or at level off after takeoff.
       3.15.1.2. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or in-tercept. In addition, a check for
       proper operation of all transfer tanks (wing tanks balanced and tank 1 feeding) will be
       performed prior to and between engagements or planned maneuvering above 30 units
       AOA.
       3.15.1.3. Following Air Refueling.
   3.15.2. Minimum items to check are engine instru-ments, total and internal fuel
   quantities/balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system, cabin altitude, and G meter/OWS.
   3.15.2. (AETC) If the G-suit malfunctions or becomes disconnected, terminate all air
   combat training (ACBT) maneuvering until normal operation is reestablished.
   3.15.3. For formation flights, the flight leader may initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal and wingmen will respond appropriately.
       3.15.3.1. The query and response for ops checks will include pointer over counter
       readings (EXAMPLE: “12.5 over 15.0” EXCEPTION: Total fuel only may periodically
       be used during high demand phases of flight). Following external fuel consumption,
       ensure tank-one is feeding correctly and include “Tank-one feeding” in the ops check.
       Add a “balanced” call to the normal Ops Check reply when wing fuel balance checks are
       required and the difference is no greater than 200 lbs. (EXAMPLE: “8.5 squared and
       balanced”). If wingmen are within 500 lbs. of the flight lead, a “same” call may be used
       at the discretion of the OG/CC. 3
       3.15.3.2. When more than one external tank is carried, add a “tanks feeding” call to the
       normal Ops Check reply. When flying the two-wing tank configuration, make a “tanks
       dry” call once the external tanks are confirmed dry and prior to transitioning to unlimited
 20                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


      training rules. Once the “tanks dry” call has been made, no further reference to tanks
      need be made on subsequent Ops Checks.
   3.15.4. G-awareness Exercise - Reference AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-3, Chapter 9. A G-
   awareness exercise will be briefed and accomplished on all tactical missions, day or night,
   with or without night vision goggles, anytime you plan or are likely to maneuver above 5
   G‟s. Pilots must have sufficient visual cues to perform this maneuver. Flight members will
   maintain a minimum of 6000 feet separation between aircraft during the execution of all G-
   Awareness exercises. Visual lookout and formation contracts will be primary for
   deconfliction. All available on board systems will be used to aid in maintaining separation
   during execution. If poor weather or night illumination conditions preclude safe
   accomplishment of the g-awareness exercise, flight leads will modify the profile and limit
   maneuvering accordingly. Briefings for night G awareness maneuvers will emphasize
   wingman deconfliction procedures and maintaining spatial/situational awareness throughout
   the maneuver. IAW AFTTP 3-3 both turns will be tactical 180‟s. G-awareness maneuvers
   and all tactical portions of all missions will be taped hot mike for review of G straining
   techniques during the debrief.
   3.15.4. (AETC) G-awareness Exercise. Accomplish the G-Ex day or night, only in VMC,
   with a discernable horizon, and only when unaided or NVG-aided visual cues are adequate to
   safely perform the maneuver. If these requirements are not met, omit the G-Ex and reduce
   mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5g.
      3.15.4.1. (PACAF, USAFE) Do not use G-awareness turns for systems checks or
      other items that detract from the intended purpose.
      3.15.4.2. (PACAF) Minimum spacing between aircraft during maneuver is 6,000ft (or
      12,000ft if operating from a trail position).
      3.15.4.3. (Added-AETC) Do not accomplish system checks or other items that detract
      from the intent of the G-awareness exercise during G-awareness turns.
      3.15.4.4. (Added-AETC) Conduct the G-Ex in order of preference listed below to help
      ensure the airspace is clear from potential traffic conflicts. If practical, use ATC to help
      clear the airspace:
          3.15.4.4.1. (Added-AETC) Within Special Use Airspace (e.g. Restricted/Warning
          areas, Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MOAs and MAJCOM
          approved large scale exercise/special mission areas).
          3.15.4.4.2. (Added-AETC) Above 10,000 MSL outside of special use airspace.
          3.15.4.4.3. (Added-AETC) Inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR).
          3.15.4.4.4. (Added-AETC) Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
      3.15.4.5. (Added-AETC) Flight/element leads flying outside of CONUS will follow
      gaining MAJCOM, theater or host nation guidance on airspace in which G-Ex may be
      performed. If no such guidance exists, follow the above procedures to the maximum
      practical extent.
3.16. Radio Procedures.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                         21


   3.16.1. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign unless excepted below.
   Transmit only that information essential for mission accomplishment or safe flight. Use
   visual signals when practical.
   3.16.2. Make a “Knock-It-Off”(KIO)/”Terminate” radio call to cease tactical maneuvering
   for any reason, particularly when a dangerous situation is developing. Any flight member
   may make this call. A KIO applies to any phase of flight and any type of mission. All
   participants will acknowledge a KIO by repeating the call.
   3.16.3. The flight/mission leader will initiate all radio checks and channel changes.
   Individual flight members will acknowledge, in turn, by callsign prior to any flight member
   switching channels unless briefed otherwise.
   3.16.4. Acknowledge radio checks that do not require the transmission of specific data by
   individual flight members in turn (EXAMPLE: “2, 3, 4”). Acknowledgment indicates the
   appropriate action is complete, in the process of being completed, or the flight member
   understands.
   3.16.5. In addition to the radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-203, AFI 11-202 Volume 3,
   Specific Mission Guides, and FLIP publications, the following radio transmissions are
   required:
       3.16.5.1. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the initial ATC clearance.
       Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by the flight lead, or anytime
       during trail departures/recoveries as detailed in paragraph 4.3.
       3.16.5.2. Gear Checks. Each pilot will report gear down on base leg, or, if making a
       VFR straight in approach not later than 3 miles on final. When flying an instrument
       approach, report gear down in response to ATC instructions or no later than the final
       approach fix or glide path interception point. A wingman or chase need not make this call
       during a formation or chased approach.
   3.16.6. Use brevity code and other terminology IAW AFI 11-214, AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1
   and local standards.
3.17. Change of Aircraft Control. Both aircrew members of an F-15B/D must know at all
times who has control of the aircraft. Use the statement “You have the aircraft” to transfer
aircraft control. The aircrew member receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge “I have
the aircraft.” Once assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as
stated above. EXCEPTION: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control
of the aircraft) will shake the stick and assume control of the aircraft, radios, and navigational
equipment unless prebriefed otherwise.
3.18. General Low Altitude Procedures.
   3.18.1. Fly low level formation positions/tactics using AFTTP 3-1 and AFTTP 3-3, Fighter
   Fundamentals, as guides.
   3.18.2. Line abreast formation is authorized at or above 300 feet AGL. When flying below
   300 feet AGL, direct the wingman to a wedge formation position.
   3.18.3. Training in the 300 feet to 100 feet AGL altitude block will be in short segments
   consistent with real-world risks and realistic tactical considerations.
22                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


  3.18.4. During briefings, emphasize low altitude flight maneuvering and observation of
  terrain features/obstacles along the route of flight. For low altitude training over
  water/featureless terrain, include specific considerations with emphasis on minimum altitudes
  and spatial disorientation.
  3.18.5. All obstacle avoidance planning will be based on Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) and
  Route Abort Altitude (RAA) as defined in paragraph 2.3.3.3.
  3.18.6. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known vertical
  obstructions, which are a factor to the flight, flight leads will direct a climb NLT 3 NM prior
  to the obstacle to ensure vertical separation. The climb must be to an altitude at or above
  briefed RAA/MSA. Do not descend below this altitude until positional/situational awareness
  dictates it is safe to do so.
  3.18.7. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
  than lead.
  3.18.8. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G and do not exceed
  approximately 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1G is limited to upright
  bunting maneuvers.
  3.18.9. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300 KCAS unless operating IAW
  paragraph 5.3.5, low altitude restricted maneuvering target.
  3.18.10. Minimum Altitudes. The unit commander will determine and certify pilots‟
  minimum altitude IAW AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 1, as supplemented. Flight members
  participating in approved step-down training programs will comply with the requirements
  and restrictions of that program. The following minimum altitudes apply to low level training
  unless national rules, route restrictions, or a training syllabus specifies higher altitudes:
  3.18.10. (AETC) Minimum altitude is 500 feet above ground level (AGL).
     3.18.10.1. 500 feet AGL for: LOWAT Category I qualified pilots.
     3.18.10.2. 300 Feet AGL for: LOWAT Category II qualified pilots.
     3.18.10.3. 100 AGL for: LOWAT Category III qualified pilots.
     3.18.10.4. For night or IMC operation: The minimum altitude is 1000 feet above the
     highest obstacle within 5 NM of course unless operating under the conditions of
     paragraph 3.21.3.
     3.18.10.5. (ACC/ANG) 57 FW and AATC will fly low level as required for test sorties
     or IAW Weapons School Syllabi.
     3.18.10.6. DELETED.
     3.18.10.7. (ANG/USAFE) ANG/USAFE units participating in AATC tests will fly low
     level as required to meet test objectives.
     3.18.10.8. For over water operation, the minimum altitude is 1000 feet above the surface
     unless in sight of land. If in sight of land, the minimum altitude may be lowered to 500
     feet above the surface.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                          23


   3.18.11. During all low altitude operations, the im-mediate reaction to task saturation,
   diverted atten-tion, knock-it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a prebriefed safe altitude
   (minimum 1000 feet AGL).
   3.18.12. Weather minimums for visual low level training are 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles
   visibility for any route or area, or as specified in FLIP for Military Training Routes, unit
   regulations, or national rules, whichever is higher.
       3.18.12.1. (USAFE) Weather minimums in countries where minimum low level
       altitude is 1000 feet AGL are: ceiling 2,000 feet or 500 feet above planned flight
       altitude, whichever is higher, and visibility 8KM. Minimums for low altitude intercept
       training in these countries are 2,500 feet AGL and 8 KM visibility.
   3.18.13. Low Level Route/Area Abort Procedures:
       3.18.13.1. Compute and brief a low-level route abort altitude (RAA) for all low level
       operations IAW paragraph 2.3.3.3.
       3.18.13.2. VMC route/area abort procedures:
           3.18.13.2.1. Maintain safe separation from the terrain and other aircraft.
           3.18.13.2.2. Comply with VFR altitude restrictions and squawk applicable (IFF/SIF)
           modes and codes.
           3.18.13.2.3. Maintain VMC at all times. If unable, follow IMC procedures outlined
           below.
           3.18.13.2.4. Attempt contact with controlling agency, if required.
       3.18.13.3. IMC route/area abort procedures:
           3.18.13.3.1. Immediately climb to, or above, the briefed RAA.
           3.18.13.3.2. Maintain preplanned ground track. Execute appropriate lost wingman
           procedures if necessary.
           3.18.13.3.3. If deviations from normal route/area procedures are required, or if the
           RAA/MSA is higher than the vertical limits of the route/area, squawk (IFF/SIF)
           emergency.
               3.18.13.3.3.1. (USAFE) Squawk emergency or according to national rules for
               all IMC route aborts.
           3.18.13.3.4. Attempt contact with the appropriate ATC agency for an IFR clearance.
           If required to fly in IMC without an IFR clearance, cruise at appropriate VFR
           altitudes until IFR clearance is received.
               3.18.13.3.4.1.   (USAFE)Request IFR traffic separation if VMC cannot be
               maintained.

3.20. Night Procedures.
   3.20.1. Night Ground Operations.
      3.20.1.1. When ground personnel are working under the aircraft, the anti-collision lights
      should be OFF, and the position lights STEADY.
      3.20.1.2. Taxi on the taxiway centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
      3.20.1.3. Use the taxi light while taxiing unless it might interfere with an aircraft landing
      or taking off. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared
      without the taxi light.
      3.20.1.4. Both wingtip position lights, both wing root anti-collision lights, and 2 out of 3
      formation lights per side, must be operational for flight (substituting a formation light in
      lieu of a wingtip position light is not permitted).
      3.20.1.5. For formation takeoffs, flight/element leaders will turn anti-collision lights OFF
      and position lights STEADY when reaching the run-up position on the runway. Wingmen
      will maintain the anti-collision light ON and position lights STEADY for takeoffs.
   3.20.2. Night Takeoff. During a night formation takeoff, direct brake release and
   configuration changes on the radio. Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on
   runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating turns, except where departure
   instructions specifically pre-clude compliance.
   3.20.3. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath is a ceiling of 3,000
   feet and 5 miles visibility. After join-up, turn all the anti-collision lights OFF and position
   lights to STEADY except for the last aircraft in formation, which will keep the anti-collision
   light ON unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
   3.20.4. Night Formation Procedures.
      3.20.4.1. When in positions other than fingertip, route, or tactical, maintain aircraft
      spacing primarily by instruments, RADAR/AAI, and/or timing with visual reference
      secondary. If aircraft spacing can-not be ensured, then establish altitude separation (1,000
      feet minimum). Crosscheck instruments at all times to ensure ground clear-ance.
      3.20.4.2. Do not change lead or wing formation positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless
      on RADAR downwind. Direct lead and position changes using the radio and from a
      stabilized, wings-level attitude.
      3.20.4.3. Night Fingertip/Route Position. Night references for fingertip and route
      formation positions are specified in AFTTP 3-3.
   3.20.5. Night Break-up. Prior to a formation break-up at night, the flight leader will
   transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be acknowledged by
   wingmen. Wingmen will confirm good navigational aids and return aircraft lighting, if
   reduced, to normal.
   3.20.6. Night Landing. Normally land from an instrument straight-in approach. Refer to
   AFI 11-202 Volume 3, as supplemented for specific procedures.
   3.20.6. (AETC) Night Landing. For night operations, the destination (other than home
   station) and alternate (if required) must have an operational straight-in approach with
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                         25


   glidepath guidance. Visual descent path indicator or precision guidance systems constitute
   acceptable glidepath guidance. Aircrews may perform approaches at facilities with no
   glidepath guidance if they descend no lower than the published minimum descent altitude.
      3.20.6.1. DELETED.
      3.20.6.2. Only perform night formation landings when required for safe recovery of the
      aircraft.
3.21. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures.
   3.21.1. USAF/MAJCOM guidance (including AFI 11-202 Volume 3, and AFI 11-214)
   outline NVG procedures. AFTTP 3-1 and AFTTP 3-3 will incorporate expanded tactical
   guidance. Additionally:
      3.21.1.1. NVGs will only be worn by qualified flight members or when upgrading with
      NVGs with a qualified NVG instructor in the flight.
      3.21.1.2. Fly with NVGs only in MAJCOM approved NVG compatible lighted cockpits.
      Permanently modified NVG compatible cockpits that have a degraded light source may
      be used for NVG missions at the discretion of the unit commander. All control and
      performance instruments must be illuminated by an NVG-compatible light source to
      provide immediate reference.
      3.21.1.3. Flight leads will brief the appropriate time to don/doff goggles for the sortie to
      be flown. Pilots will ensure deconfliction while donning/doffing goggles.
      3.21.1.4. When operating in a visual formation outside of NVG Close, more frequent
      cross-check of instruments will be made (approximately every 4-6 seconds) to reduce
      possibility of spatial dis/mis-orientation.
   3.21.2. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted for the individual in the unit eyelane
   prior to NVG operations. Do not wear NVGs during takeoff or landing. Do not don NVGs
   until at least 2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight. In all cases, remove NVGs prior to
   the final approach fix.
   3.21.3. NVG equipped aircraft may operate below the RAA/MSA down to a minimum of
   1,000 ft AGL during high-illumination (HI) periods (as defined by AFI 11-214). The flight
   lead or individual pilot is the final authority to assess actual illumination for a particular
   mission element, based on visibility and terrain features/resolution.
   3.21.4. NVGs may be worn for night tanker rejoins, but will be raised to the up/stowed
   position or removed no later than the precontact position.
   3.21.5. Unless required for battle damage checks or aircraft assistance, wingmen wearing
   NVGs will fly no closer than route formation.
   3.21.6. Battle Damage Checks. NVGs will remain on. The aircraft performing the check
   will approach with position lights bright steady/flash or beacons on while the aircraft being
   checked sets external lights to a minimum, preferably off.
   3.21.7. In-flight Emergencies with NVGs. During in-flight emergencies, immediately
   assess whether the NVGs aid or hinder completing emergency procedures. If they are a
 26                                           AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


   hindrance or the emergency may deteriorate into an ejection situation, remove and stow the
   NVGs.
   3.21.8. Abnormal Procedures.
      3.21.8.1. Lost sight. If you lose sight within a flight, execute appropriate lost wingman
      procedures. Consider highlighting position by increasing exterior lighting level,
      activating the afterburners, or deploying chaff/flares as the situation warrants.
      3.21.8.2. NVG failure. Ensure separation from other aircraft and the ground before
      attempting to remedy the NVG failure.
          3.21.8.2.1. Transition to instruments.
          3.21.8.2.2. Perform lost wingman procedures if appropriate.
          3.21.8.2.3. Route abort/climb above MSA if appropriate.
          3.21.8.2.4. Terminate/KIO as applicable.
          3.21.8.2.5. If other aircraft are in the vicinity, direct them to raise their external lights
          to non-NVG visible levels.
          3.21.8.2.6. Attempt to regain NVG operation by switching to the opposite battery.
          Once clear of other aircraft and terrain, change the battery. If these steps do not solve
          the problem, stow NVGs and proceed with non-NVG plan.
      3.21.8.3. Inadvertent flight into weather . Encountering poor weather conditions
      during NVG operations may cause loss of SA and aircrew distraction/disorientation.
          3.21.8.3.1. Single ship or separated from flight members:
              3.21.8.3.1.1. Transition to instruments.
              3.21.8.3.1.2. Route abort if LOWAT, otherwise climb/descend to VMC.
              3.21.8.3.1.3. Terminate/KIO as applicable.
          3.21.8.3.2. Formation flight. If entering weather in formation/close proximity to
          other aircraft, perform the first five steps under NVG failure, as appropriate, then
          climb/descend to attempt to regain VMC.
3.22. Fuel Requirements.
   3.22.1. Joker Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel needed to termi-nate an event and proceed with the
   remainder of the mission.
   3.22.2. Bingo Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel state that allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below:
   3.22.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the FAF at the base of intended
   landing or al-ternate, if required. Fuel quantity will be as estab-lished locally or 2,000
   pounds, whichever is higher.
   3.22.4. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that an aircraft may land at the
   intended destination or alternate, if required, with:
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                            27


       3.22.4.1. Minimum Fuel - 1200 pounds or less.
       3.22.4.2. Emergency Fuel - 800 pounds or less.
3.23. Approaches and Landings.
   3.23.1. The desired touchdown point for a VFR ap-proach is 500 feet from the threshold or
   the glideslope interception point for a precision approach. When local procedures or unique
   conditions require landing beyond the normal touchdown point, adjust the touchdown point
   accordingly.
   3.23.2. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft is 3,000 feet for
   similar aircraft (e.g. F-15 versus F-15), 6,000 feet for dis-similar aircraft (e.g. F-15 versus F-
   16) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base, whichever is higher. Increase spacing
   whenever wake turbulence is anticipated.
   3.23.3. Normally, all aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the turnoff
   (cold) side of the runway when speed/conditions permit.
   3.23.4. Landing Restrictions.
       3.23.4.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway,
       land at an alter-nate if possible.
       3.23.4.2. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g. MA-1A, 61QSII).
       3.23.4.3. During the aerobrake portion of a normal, dry runway landing, leave flaps
       down to provide increased aerodynamic drag and normal nose fall.
       3.23.4.4. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 12, land at an
       alternate if possible. If an alternate is not available, an approach end or midfield
       arrestment is recommended.
       3.23.4.5. DELETED.
       3.23.4.6. (Added-AETC) Aircraft landing at preplanned destinations or alternates with
       less than 8,000 feet of runway length and without a compatible departure end arresting
       gear require specific approval by the OG/CC.
3.24. Overhead Traffic Patterns.
   3.24.1. Overhead patterns can be made with unex-pended practice ordnance and unexpended
   live air-to-air ordnance.
   3.24.2. Initiate the break over the touchdown point or as directed.
   3.24.3. Execute individual breaks in a level 180 degree turn to the downwind leg at
   minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP/FE chase or when in tactical formation).
   3.24.4. Aircraft must be wings level on final at ap-proximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile
   from the planned touchdown point.
   3.24.5. DELETED.
3.25. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tacti-cal entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted when:
   3.25.1. The published overhead pattern altitude and air-speed are used.
 28                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


   3.25.2. Specific procedures are developed and coordinated with appropriate air traffic
   control agencies.
   3.25.3. No more than four aircraft are in the flight. Aircraft/elements more than 6,000 feet in
   trail are considered a separate flight.
   3.25.4. No air-craft are offset from the runway in the direc-tion of the break. The intent is to
   avoid requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal down-wind.
   3.25.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.26. Touch-and-Go Landings.
   3.26.1. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3, as supplemented by
   MAJCOM.
   3.26.1. (AETC) Touch-and-go landings are authorized for continuation and formal syllabus
   training. Touch-and-go landings will only be performed in an F-15B or D model aircraft with
   a current rear cockpit instructor pilot (IP) on board or a rear cockpit IP regaining currency
   with a basic mission capable or combat mission ready pilot current and qualified in landing
   in the front cockpit.
   3.26.2. Do not fly touch-and-go landings with live or hung ord-nance (except a safed 20mm
   gun) or with fuel remaining in any external tank.
3.27. Low Approaches.
   3.27.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
   3.27.2. Normal/no flap single ship low approaches - so that touchdown does not occur.
   3.27.3. IP/FE flying chase position - 50 feet AGL.
   3.27.4. Formation low approaches and non-IP/FE chase - 100 feet AGL.
   3.27.5. Chase aircraft during an emergency - 300 feet AGL unless safety or circumstances
   dictate oth-erwise.
       3.27.5.1. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude
       until crossing the departure end of the runway unless local proce-dures, missed
       approach/climbout procedures, or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.28. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
di-rected/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. When in formation, a
sequential closed may be flown with ATC concurrence at an interval to ensure proper spacing.
Plan to arrive on downwind at 200-250 KCAS.
3.29. Back Seat Approaches and Landings.
   3.29.1. A rear-cockpit (RCP) landing qualified instructor pilot may accomplish back seat
   landings. An upgrading IP may only accomplish back seat landings when a RCP landing
   qualified IP is in the front cockpit.
   3.29.2. During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the
   area, moni-tor aircraft parameters and configurations, and be prepared to direct a go-around
   or take control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if neces-sary.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                      29


3.30. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.30.1. General:
      3.30.1.1. Normally accomplish formation landings from a precision approach. If not,
      accomplish the landing from a published instrument approach or a VFR straight-in
      approach using the VASI, if available. In all cases, use a rate of descent similar to a
      normal precision approach.
      3.30.1.2. A qualified flight leader must lead continuation training formation landings
      unless an IP or flight lead qualified squadron supervisor is in the element.
      3.30.1.3. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds weight of each other and symmetrically
      loaded as defined in paragraph 3.8.3.
      3.30.1.4. Position the wingman on the upwind side if crosswind exceeds 5 knots.
      3.30.1.5. The wingman must maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing.
      3.30.1.6. If the wingman overruns the leader after landing, accept the overrun and
      maintain the appropriate side of the runway and aircraft control. Do not attempt to
      reposition behind the leader. The most important consideration is wingtip clearance.
   3.30.2. Formation landings are prohibited:
      3.30.2.1. When the crosswind or gust component exceeds 10 knots.
      3.30.2.2. When the runway is reported wet; or ice, slush, or snow is on the runway.
      3.30.2.3. When runway width is less than 125 feet.
      3.30.2.4. When landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live ordnance (excluding live
      air-to-air missiles, 20mm ammunition, or chaff/flares).
      3.30.2.5. When the weather is less than 500 feet and 1.5 miles or a flight member‟s
      weather category, whichever is higher.
   3.30.3. (Added-AETC) Formation VMC Drag. A briefed formation VMC drag maneuver
   may be used to establish spacing for single-ship landings when conditions do not permit a
   formation landing. Note: Formation VMC drag procedures should not be confused with trail
   recoveries (paragraph 4.3.6 in the basic instruction).
      3.30.3.1. (Added-AETC) The minimum weather required is 1,500-foot ceiling and 3
      nm visibility. All aircraft will maintain VMC from the drag point to landing.
      3.30.3.2. (Added-AETC) Prior to directing the formation VMC drag under instrument
      flight rules, lead will coordinate with the appropriate ATC agency for nonstandard
      formation during the remainder of the approach.
      3.30.3.3. (Added-AETC) The wingmen may use briefed power settings and
      configurations (speed brake, gear and flaps) to establish and maintain spacing. Wingmen
      will not fly below final approach speed and s-turns will not be used to gain or maintain
      separation while on final.
      3.30.3.4. (Added-AETC) The minimum spacing is 3,000 feet or greater, as briefed.
 30                                        AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


       3.30.3.5. (Added-AETC) The latest drag point must allow adequate time for the
       wingmen to establish required separation and then for lead to slow to final approach
       speed not later than 3 nm from the runway. On instrument final approaches, the drag is
       normally accomplished so as to establish separation prior to the final approach fix or
       glideslope intercept.
       3.30.3.6. (Added-AETC) Any time the spacing is in question, the wingman will go-
       around or execute the missed approach, notify ATC, and comply with local procedures.
3.31. After Shutdown Procedures. All flight members will accomplish a post flight walk-
around. The intent of this inspection is to find evidence of birdstrike, lost panels, damaged
ordnance, and structural damage resulting from over-Gs or other in-flight abnormalities.
3.32. (USAFE) Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Normal flying operations will not be
conducted when surface winds along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady state
over land (25 knots over water) or when the Sea State exceeds 4 meters wave height. This is
not intended to restrict point-to-point operations when only a small portion of the route is
affected. If possible, alter the mission plan to avoid that area. The OG/CC (or equivalent) is
the waiver authority.

3.36. (Added-AETC) Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Units will restrict their flying
operations when high winds or sea states would be hazardous to aircrew members in ejection
situations. Flights are not permitted over land when steady state surface winds (forecast or
actual) in training or operating areas exceed 35 knots. Overwater flights will not be permitted
when wave heights (forecast or actual) exceed 10 feet or steady state surface winds (forecast or
actual) exceed 25 knots in training or operating areas. This is not intended to restrict operations
when only a small portion of the route or area is affected. The OG/CC is the waiver authority.

                                          Chapter 4

                               INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category.
   4.1.1. The F-15 is Approach Category E. Accomplish missed approach IAW flight manual
   procedures. Missed approach airspeed is 200-250 KCAS.
   4.1.2. Use approach Category D minimums at an emergency/divert airfield where no
   Category E minimums are published. Airfields with Category D minimums may be
   designated as an alternate (divert) airfield. Further, practice instrument approaches may be
   flown using Category D minimums if VMC can be maintained throughout the procedure.
   Under these circumstances, approach Category D minimums may be used provided:
      4.1.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.1.2.2. The aircraft is flown at final approach airspeed of 165 KCAS or less.
      4.1.2.3. The aircraft is flown at 255 knots true airspeed (KTAS) or less for the missed
      approach seg-ment of the approach. At high-pressure altitudes and temperatures 255
      KTAS may not be compatible with published missed approach airspeeds and Category D
      approaches should not be flown.
   4.1.3. The F-15‟s INS is approved for enroute Area Navigation (RNAV). The enroute
   navigation may not exceed 1.5 hours between INS updates. An update is defined as
   establishing a positive position using visual, TACAN, or on-board radar. Do not fly RNAV
   approaches.
   4.1.4. (USAFE) Due to a variety of host nation and ICAO procedures which may differ
   from standard F-15C procedures, pilots must ensure that the airspeeds they utilize on
   instrument approach procedures are compatible with both ICAO/TERPS and safety of
   flight requirements.
4.2. Takeoff and Join-up.
   4.2.1. The flight leader must get an appropriate ATC clearance (altitude block or trail
   formation) when a flight join-up is not possible due to weather conditions or operational
   requirements. Formation trail departures must comply with instructions for a nonstandard
   formation flight as defined in FLIP.
   4.2.2. If weather is below 1500 feet and 3 miles, each aircraft/element will climb on takeoff
   heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when departure instructions
   specifically preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General.
      4.3.1.1. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and must not
      be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
      airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If task saturation occurs,
      cease attempts to maintain trail, concentrate on flying the instrument departure, and then
      notify the flight lead. The flight lead will then notify air traffic control (ATC).
34                                          AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


     4.3.1.2. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC.
     4.3.1.3. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
     4.3.1.4. Flight leads will brief aircraft/element spacing. Minimum spacing between
     aircraft when in non-standard formation is 9,000 feet and will be maintained using on
     board radar systems.
     4.3.1.5. Each aircraft/element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the
     aircraft/element immediately in trail has radar contact and called “tied.”
  4.3.2. No Radar Contact.
     4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay
     turns to maintain the desired spacing.
     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft/element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 mile spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft/element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft/element calls “tied.”
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft/element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding
     aircraft/elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding
     aircraft/elements and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft/element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation from
     the preceding aircraft/element until establishing radar/visual contact, except in instances
     where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical separation
     to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft/element to meet
     the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. Radar Contact.
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft/element will call “tied” when radar contact is established with the
     preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, unless
     radar contact is lost. If ATC directs a question, or guidance to a certain aircraft, that pilot
     may respond directly to ATC. Flight leads will ensure that wingman are aware of any
     unplanned or ATC directed intermediate level off altitudes.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e. radar,
     TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures.
     4.3.4.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL/AB power until reaching 350
     KCAS. Climb at 350 KCAS until reaching cruise mach/KTAS, unless otherwise briefed.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                       35


     4.3.4.3. Upon reaching 350 KCAS, the flight leader will set 850 FTIT unless otherwise
     briefed.
     4.3.4.4. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
  4.3.5. Enroute Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
     4.3.6.1. Trail recovery procedures must be coordinated/approved through the responsible
     ATC facilities and addressed in a local operating procedure or in the unit supplement to
     this volume. Trail recoveries will only be accomplished at home stations/deployed
     locations where procedures have been established and briefed. As a minimum,
     procedures must address each recovery profile, missed approach, climbout, lost contact,
     lost communications and desired/maximum spacing requirements.
         4.3.6.1.1. (PACAF) Trail recoveries greater than a 2 ship are not authorized for
         any arrival at a deployed base other than the pilots’ home station.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
     4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is
     at/above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
     whichever is higher.
     4.3.6.4. Trail recoveries will not terminate in simultaneous PAR or ASR approaches.
     Recoveries to separate PAR/ASRs are authorized, flights will split prior to PAR/ASR
     final.
     4.3.6.5. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration, and airspeeds.
     Minimum spacing between aircraft is 9,000 feet in IMC and will be maintained using on-
     board radar.
     4.3.6.6. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
     spacing.
     4.3.6.7. Prior to split-up, the flight lead must ensure that all wingmen have operative
     navigational aids and air-to-air radar.
     4.3.6.8. Formation break-up will be accomplished IAW paragraph 4.4. Flight separation
     will be IAW local ATC directives.
     4.3.6.9. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC.
     4.3.6.10. ATC instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight. ATC will
     provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
     4.3.6.11. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
     4.3.6.12. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
     comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
     4.3.6.13. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed/
     configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead‟s call,
     all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
     4.3.6.14. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
 36                                           AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


       4.3.6.15. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit “C/S lost
       contact.” The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and heading.
       Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC. If contact
       is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members may
       continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If separation
       cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climbout as instructed by ATC.
4.4. Formation Break-up. If possible, accomplish formation break-up in VMC. If IMC,
accomplish the break-up in straight and level flight. Prior to a break-up in IMC, the flight leader
must transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude, and altimeter setting that will be ac-knowledged by
wingmen. Wingmen must confirm good navigational aids.
4.5. Formation Penetration.
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route/close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
   4.5.3. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the
   base of intended landing is at/above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC forma-tion flights, do not change lead or wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on RADAR downwind.
4.7. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight requires a qualified safety
observer in either cockpit of the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. Use all means to clear the area for
hazards.
   4.7.1. A safety observer in the same aircraft must have an operable intercom.
   4.7.2. A chase aircraft is required in order to log simulated instrument flight in an F-15A/C.
   This does not preclude flying approaches in VMC without a chase, however, in this case
   place primary emphasis on the “See and Avoid” concept. Chase aircraft will be in a position
   where they can effectively clear and/or provide assistance. Chased instrument approaches
   may terminate in formation landings.
4.8. Use of the Heads Up Display (HUD). For the F-15A/B/C/D, use the HUD as an additional
instrument reference not as the sole instrument reference. Do not use the HUD to recover from
an unusual attitude or when executing lost wingman procedures except when no other reference
is available.
4.9. Use of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS). Although JHMCS displays
sufficient aircraft flight symbology to provide basic situational awareness, it is not intended to be
used for primary flight instrumentation. Do not use JHMCS to recover from an unusual attitude
or to execute a lost wingman procedure.
4.10. (Added-AETC) Pilot Weather Categories (PWC). PWCs are designed to reduce the
exposure of pilots with limited experience to the risks inherent during periods of low ceiling and
visibility.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                          37

      qualify for PWC 1.                                   feet and 1 1/2 miles, whichever is
                                                           greater.
3   3    A student enrolled in a formal training course    Suitable published minimums or 700
         after successful completion of a formal           feet and 2 miles, whichever is greater.
         instrument evaluation in the assigned aircraft.
    4.10.1. (Added-AETC) Before assigning a lower weather category, a PWC 1 instructor
    must evaluate the pilot's instrument proficiency. When calculating total time for the purpose
    of PWC, do not include student, undergraduate flying training, or other flight time. F-15
    hours include all series or mission types.
    4.10.2. (Added-AETC) Assignment of PWC 1 status is dependent on the pilot's
    demonstrated knowledge and performance in flight under PWC 2 operations and in aircrew
    training devices with low-visibility capability. The commander of the flying squadron the
    pilot is assigned or attached to will certify assignment to PWC 1. File PWC certification
    documentation in the pilot's flight training folder.
    4.10.3. (Added-AETC) PWC 1 is the minimum for normal training or support missions.
    When overriding mission requirements dictate, OG/CCs may individually authorize highly
    experienced pilots to use published approach minimums. PWC 1 minimums apply to all
    current PWC 2 pilots for approaches at the home field.
    4.10.4. (Added-AETC) If an instructor pilot (IP) is on board, aircrews may use the IP's
    PWC.
    4.10.5. (Added-AETC) For formation approaches, the pilot with the most restrictive PWC
    minimums determines the flight's category.
    4.10.6. (Added-AETC) Use the approach-end runway visual range to determine takeoff and
    landing criteria.
    4.10.7. (Added-AETC) Units may place qualified pilots on air defense alert regardless of
    their PWC. When existing or forecast weather is below PWC minimums, place the pilot on
    mandatory alert status. Table 4.1. specifies PWC minimums.
 38                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


4.11. (Added-AETC) Instrument Flight Rules Restrictions.
   4.11.1. (Added-AETC) Takeoff minimums (except active air defense missions) are
   specified in Table 4.1. Base the decision to launch a local sortie on the existing weather and
   forecast for planned landing plus 1 hour. Base the decision to launch nonlocal sorties on the
   existing weather at takeoff time.
   4.11.2. (Added-AETC) Do not file to a destination unless the ceiling and visibility for the
   ETA, plus or minus 1 hour, is at or above the appropriate PWC or suitable published
   minimums, whichever is greater. See Table 4.1.
   4.11.3. (Added-AETC) Do not commence a penetration, en route descent, or approach
   unless existing ceiling and visibility meet the requirements of Table 4.1. During actual
   instrument meteorological conditions, a precision approach monitored by surveillance radar
   is the preferred approach. This does not prevent instrument practice for other types of
   approaches if the ceiling and visibility are at or above minimums for the approach being
   flown.
   4.11.4. (Added-AETC) After commencing a penetration or approach and if weather is
   reported below the required PWC or published minimums (ceiling or visibility), the pilot
   may continue the approach to the PWC or published minimums, whichever is higher. The
   PWC decision height/altitude or minimum descent altitude will be determined by reference to
   the touch-down-zone elevation (TDZE) for straight-in approaches and airport elevation for
   circling approaches. When TDZE is not depicted or is unavailable, the pilot will use the
   runway threshold elevation, or airport elevation, in that order. He or she may descend below
   the decision height/altitude or minimum descent altitude if (1) the aircraft is in a position to
   make a normal approach to the runway of intended landing, and (2) he or she can clearly see
   the approach threshold of the runway, approach lights, or other markings identifiable with the
   approach end of the runway. In all cases, the pilot will comply with the last clearance
   received until obtaining a revised clearance.CAUTION: The use of PWC minimums on a
   precision approach may require a pilot to execute a missed approach prior to the published
   decision height/altitude. In these instances, upon reaching PWC minimums and making the
   decision not to continue the approach, the pilot should start a climb immediately while
   proceeding to the nonprecision missed approach point (MAP). On reaching the nonprecision
   MAP, he or she should continue with the published missed approach procedure.
   4.11.5. (Added-AETC) For remote or island destinations, compute fuel requirements to
   include fuel for 30 minutes holding at the destination fix.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                            39

                          AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

5.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains air-to-air procedures, to include operations with live
ordnance applicable to all air-craft. This chapter specifies procedures or restrictions applicable to
F-15 operations.
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment. Missions may be flown with a loaded gun provided the gun
is safe IAW T.O. 1F-15C-34-1-3 CL-1 and a trigger check is first performed with the master arm
switch in arm with Training Mode deselected. Point the aircraft away from other aircraft and
inhabited areas during the trigger check. Do not perform a trigger check with a hot gun. If an
aircraft is flown with a hot gun or live missiles, the procedures in AFI 11-214 apply.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations.
   5.3.1. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering (LOWAT)
   is 350 KCAS.
   5.3.2. When configured with three external fuel tanks, aircraft will operate under the
   LIMITED maneuvering category as defined in AFI 11-214. When configured with external
   wing tanks and no centerline tank, UNLIMITED maneuvering is allowed once the externals
   are empty (flight manual restrictions still apply). The tank restriction does not apply to aerial
   gunnery tow aircraft. Tow aircraft may fly using any approved (for test and evaluation) or
   certified (operational) configurations.
   5.3.3. Negative-G gun jinks are prohibited.
   5.3.4. (PACAF/USAFE) With any fuel remaining in external wing tanks, minimum
   airspeed for F-15 A-D ACBT is 300 KCAS. This restriction does not apply to non-
   maneuvering intercepts, holding or max range descents.
   5.3.5. When acting as a restricted maneuvering target for low altitude intercepts, the
   minimum airspeed is 220 KCAS or 20 units AOA, whichever produces the higher airspeed.
   5.3.6. (Added-AETC) With any fuel remaining in external wing tanks, minimum airspeed
   for F-15 A-D ACBT is 300 KCAS. This restriction does not apply to non-maneuvering
   intercepts, holding or max range descents.
5.4. Aerial Gunnery Tow Procedures. AFI 11-214 applies. In addition:
   5.4.1. AGTS-36 Target Set Deployment. Deploy the target set over areas clear of surface
   activity, near the range where shooting will occur. The tow will maintain 240 +/- 10 KCAS
   and ensure other flight members are clear during deployment. A chase aircraft will ensure
   that the AGTS-36 tow reel turbine doors open for deployment and the visual augmenter (VA)
   deploys properly. Any time the target set becomes unstable or flies erratic, the chase aircraft
   will advise the tow to cut the target loose.
   5.4.2. AGTS-36 Target Set Reel-In. The tow will slow to 240 +/- 10 KCAS and initiate
   target set reel-in when shooting is complete. A chase will evaluate target set stability and
   advise the tow of any abnormalities. Recover target sets that have been hit if they do not
   exhibit abnormal flight characteristics. However, if a target set becomes unstable or flies
40                                            AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


  erratic during reel-in, it should be cut loose. Initiate reel-in over areas clear of surface activity
  in anticipation of VA release. The chase will ensure the tow reel turbine doors are closed, the
  target set locks into place, the VA releases and perform a BDA on the tow after reel-in is
  complete.
  5.4.3. TDU-32 A/B Banner Deployment. The Banner departs the airfield fully deployed.
  Enroute to the range, chase aircraft will ensure a stable flying Banner. While in straight and
  level flight, the chase pilot will also pass the direction of “Banner lean” in clock position to
  the tow pilot. This will establish the best turn direction for employment. (If Banner is flying
  at the 10 o‟clock position; tow will turn right)
  5.4.4. TDU-32 A/B Banner Recovery. The tow will return to the drop zone IAW locally
  approved procedures for Banner release. Tower will clear the tow to the “drop zone” and the
  pilot will release the Banner for recovery by the ground crew.
  5.4.5. Abnormal Procedures.
      5.4.5.1. VA fails to deploy. Reel the target set back in and do not use for firing.
      5.4.5.2. VA fails to release after reel-in. The tow must recover using hung ordnance
      procedures.
      5.4.5.3. Erratic or unstable target set. In all cases where target sets exhibit unstable or
      erratic flight characteristics, the target set should be cut loose. Avoid trying to reel-in a
      target set that begins to become unstable/erratic, cut it free with whatever length of cable
      is present at the time it begins to fly abnormally.
      5.4.5.4. Target set shot off. Cut the remaining cable off. The cable may jam in the tow
      reel if reel-in is attempted without a target set present.
      5.4.5.5. Cutting target sets loose. Use primary and secondary cutters as the preferred
      means to cut target sets loose. If this is unsuccessful, reel out the target set until the
      cable/target set fall off. The next options depend on fuel availability, weather and
      resources. The tow may try to burn the cable off using afterburner and high AOA
      maneuvers. The target set may be drug off in the water. In this case, the chase will fly no
      lower than 1000 feet AGL and the tow no lower than 400 feet AGL. If all other means of
      cutting the target set loose are unsuccessful and the target set may not be safely
      recovered, jettison the AGTS-36 tow reel.
      5.4.5.6. Landing with cable remaining (no target set). The tow must recover using
      hung ordnance procedures. Plan the landing to avoid damage to runway approach
      lighting.
      5.4.5.7. Controlled Jettison of Banner on Takeoff. If circumstances permit, tow
      aircraft jettisons Banner IAW local jettison procedures.
      5.4.5.8. Unable to Release Banner. If possible, gain chase aircraft (shooter desired) and
      proceed to local jettison area and attempt jettison. If Banner still remains, recover IAW
      local procedures or use AGTS cable remaining procedures.
      5.4.5.9. Erratic/Unrecoverable Banner. Jettison in working area.
      5.4.5.10. Banner Shot Off, Cable Remaining. Release cable in working area. Shooter
      rejoins with tow to ensure no cable remains. If cable remains, follow procedures in 5.4.6

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

6.1. This chapter is not applicable to F-15 A-D operations.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                          43


                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances
occurs. These procedures do not supersede flight manual guidance.
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedure section of the flight manual until it has been corrected.
   7.1.2. Do not use a malfunctioning system unless it is required for safe recovery of the
   aircraft. Do not continue in-flight troubleshooting a malfunction after completing flight
   manual emergency procedures and the aircraft may be safely recovered.
   7.1.3. Only conduct fuel dumping to reduce aircraft gross weight for safety of flight. When
   circumstances permit, dump above 10,000 feet AGL over unpopulated areas. Ensure the
   dump switch is returned to normal before landing. Make the appropriate entry in the AFTO
   Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document .
   7.1.4. Do not taxi aircraft with malfunctions that effect the nosewheel steering or brake
   system.
   7.1.5. For actual or perceived flight control malfunctions, terminate maneuvering and take
   appropriate action. If the flight control problem was due to crew member/passenger stick or
   rudder interference in B/D model aircraft, the pilot will take appropriate action to ensure no
   further flight control interference occurs.
7.2. Ground Aborts.
   7.2.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight leader will normally renumber the
   flight. Flight leaders must advise the appropriate agencies of such changes.
   7.2.2. In the event of an abort, formation flight may only continue if it is led by a qualified
   flight lead. The alternatives are a sympathetic abort or proceeding on a pre-briefed single-
   ship mission.
   7.2.3. Delayed aircraft may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous point or may fly a briefed
   alternate single ship mission. If accomplishing a join-up, cease tactical maneuvering until the
   delayed aircraft is joined and all flight members are ready to continue.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts.
   7.3.1. If aborting the takeoff, clear to the appropriate side of the runway as expeditiously as
   possible based on position within the element. If this is not feasible because of possible cable
   engagement, clear straight-ahead. As soon as practical, give callsign and state intentions. Call
   “Cable, Cable, Cable” to indicate a departure-end arrestment. Following aircraft hold their
   position, abort or takeoff as appropriate to maintain adequate clearance.
   7.3.2. When applying the brakes above 120 KCAS during a takeoff abort, or hot brakes are
   suspected; declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area, and
   follow hot brake procedures.
   7.3.3. If aborting a takeoff at or above 100 KCAS, lower the tailhook. If aborting below 100
   KCAS, lower the tailhook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the runway.

7.4. Air Aborts.
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical
   callsign.
   7.4.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency to the field of intended landing. In other
   cases, the flight leader will determine if an escort is required.
   7.4.3. Abort the mission and land out of a straight-in approach, regardless of apparent
   damage or subsequent normal operation, for any of the following:
      7.4.3.1. Birdstrike/Foreign Object Damage.
      7.4.3.2. Flight control system anomalies. This does not include flight control system
      lights that reset IAW flight manual procedures.
      7.4.3.3. Engine flameout, stagnation or shutdown.
   7.4.4. If an aircraft experiences an over-G, use the following procedures:
      7.4.4.1. Perform a battle damage check after all Over-Gs.
      7.4.4.2. Non-OWS equipped aircraft and OWS equipped aircraft whose OWS is not
      operational.
          7.4.4.2.1. Terminate the mission and land as soon as practical from a straight-in
          approach.
      7.4.4.3. Aircraft equipped with an operable OWS system that experiences an over-G.
          7.4.4.3.1. Immediately terminate maneuvering and call up the OWS matrix on the
          VSD to analyze the displayed parameters.
          7.4.4.3.2. If a positive G, level “1” (one) is displayed in any column of the matrix
          except mass items (MIT), perform a battle damage check with emphasis on the
          overall condition of the aircraft. If no abnormalities are noted, the flight lead may
          continue the briefed mission. If a subsequent positive G, level “1” or greater over-G
          occurs, terminate the mission, perform a battle damage check, RTB and fly a straight-
          in approach, except as noted below.
          7.4.4.3.3. If level “1” (positive or negative) or greater is displayed in the MIT
          column, terminate the mission, perform a battle damage check, RTB and fly a
          straight-in approach.
          7.4.4.3.4. If a positive G, level “2” (two) or greater; or a negative G, any level, is
          displayed in any column of the matrix, terminate the mission, perform a battle
          damage check, RTB and fly a straight-in approach.
      7.4.4.4. Document actual over-Gs (positive G, level 1 or greater, or negative G, any
      level) in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document after
      flight.
   7.4.5. In the F-15B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in-flight
   emergen-cies. The additional aircrew member will provide checklist assistance at the request
   of the pilot in command.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                           45


7.5. Engine Malfunctions. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debriefing.
   7.5.1. (PACAF) Do not attempt further AB operation on an F100-PW-100 engine that
   exhibits afterburner failure to light, afterburner induced fan stalls, rumbles or blowouts in
   other than region three of the afterburner operation envelope (unless required for safety of
   flight).
7.6. Radio Failure.
   7.6.1. General. Individual aircraft experiencing radio failure will comply with procedures
   outlined in FLIP, AFI 11-202 Volume 3, this instruction, and local directives.
   7.6.2. Formation:
       7.6.2.1. Flight members who experience total radio failure while in close or route
       formation will maneu-ver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another
       flight member and give the appropriate visual signals. Terminate the mission as soon as
       practical and lead the NORDO aircraft to the base of intended landing or a divert base.
       Perform a formation approach to a drop-off on final unless safety considerations dictate
       otherwise.
       7.6.2.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
       aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at ap-proximately 500 feet on another
       flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from other
       flight members until his pres-ence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying clearance
       to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual signals. If pre-
       briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a ren-dezvous point and hold. If no one has
       rejoined prior to reaching BINGO fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to the base
       of intended landing or a divert base. Aircraft experiencing any difficulty/emergency in
       addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
   7.6.3. Aerial Gunnery/Missile Firing NORDO Procedures:
       7.6.3.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
       7.6.3.2. Shooting aircraft: safe the armament switches, join on another member of the
       flight or the tow aircraft, IAW para 7.6.2.
       7.6.3.3. Aerial gunnery tow aircraft: rocks wings and continue the turn if an attack is in
       progress. The flight leader of the attacking aircraft will “knock off” the attack and join on
       the tow‟s wing, remaining clear of the target in the event it is cut. The tow pilot will use
       standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight leader will signal when the
       target is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the target is away
       and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, the tow will RTB with an
       escort following the briefed NORDO recovery procedures. If cable remains, follow local
       procedures.
   7.6.4. NORDO Recovery:
       7.6.4.1. Apply the procedures in AFI 11-205 and FLIP.
       7.6.4.2. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
       the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
 46                                          AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


       aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
       wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
       7.6.4.3. A NORDO aircraft intending to make an approach-end cable engagement should
       signal the escorting aircraft by extending the tailhook. If the NORDO aircraft is not
       escorted, the pilot should fly a straight-in approach flashing the landing light on final to
       signal the tower.
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Avoid flight through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
should break-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration.
7.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential. Upon losing sight of the leader or if unable to maintain formation the
wingman will simultaneously:
   7.8.1. Execute the applicable lost wingman procedures. Refer to para 7.9 for specific spatial
   disorientation (SD) considerations. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to
   minimize the effects of SD.
       7.8.1.1. Transition to primary flight instruments.
       7.8.1.2. Inform lead by transmitting “C/S is lost wingman.”
       7.8.1.3. After executing a lost wingman procedure, do not attempt rejoining with the
       flight until obtaining permission from the flight lead.
       7.8.1.4. When able, obtain a separate clearance.
       7.8.1.5. Observe all published terrain clearance limits.
   7.8.2. Two- or Three-Ship Flights (three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship procedures):
       7.8.2.1. Wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn away
       using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume original heading.
       7.8.2.2. Turns:
          7.8.2.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank
          for 15 seconds. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming the
          turn.
          7.8.2.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
          and direct the flight leader to roll out of the turn. Maintain the original turn. The
          leader may only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
       7.8.2.3. Final Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       execute the published missed approach procedure.
       7.8.2.4. Missed Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       continue the published or assigned missed approach procedure. Climb to 500 feet above
       missed approach altitude.
   7.8.3. Four-Ship Flights. Number 2 and 3 follow the procedures outlined above. Number
   4‟s initial action assumes that number 3 has also gone lost wingman. In addition to paragraph
   7.8, number 4 will:
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                            47


       7.8.3.1. Wings-Level Flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn away
       using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume the original heading.
       7.8.3.2. Turns:
          7.8.3.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for
          30 seconds to en-sure separation from lead and number 3.
          7.8.3.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
          and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Direct the leader to roll out. The leader will
          only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
   7.8.4. Leader must acknowledge the lost wingman‟s radio call and, when appropriate,
   transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters.
   7.8.5. If a wingman becomes separated and any air-craft experiences radio failure, the
   aircraft with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance. The NORDO aircraft will
   turn the IFF/SIF to NORMAL code 7600 while proceeding with previous clearance. If an
   emergency situation arises along with radio failure, turn the IFF/SIF to EMERGENCY for
   the remainder of the flight.
   7.8.6. Only practice lost wingman procedures in VMC.
7.9. Spatial Disorientation (SD). Conditions that prevent a clear visual horizon or increase
pilot task-ing are conducive to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot must increase his instrument
crosscheck rate. If SD symptoms are encountered:
   7.9.1. Single Ship:
       7.9.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the attitude
       indicator. Use heads-down instruments. If flying dual, consider transferring control to the
       other crewmember.
       7.9.1.2. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, fly straight and level flight until
       symptoms abate, usually within 60 seconds. Consider using the autopilot.
       7.9.1.3. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC.
       7.9.1.4. NOTE: It is possible for SD to proceed to the point where the aircrew is unable
       to see or interpret the flight instruments. In this situation, aircraft control may be
       impossible. If this occurs, the aircrew should consider ejecting.
   7.9.2. Formation Lead:
       7.9.2.1. Advise the wingmen that he has SD and comply with procedures in paragraph
       7.9.1.
       7.9.2.2. Use the wingmen to confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback.
       7.9.2.3. If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the simplest
       and safest means possible.
   7.9.3. Formation Wingman:
       7.9.3.1. Advise lead of the disorientation.
       7.9.3.2. Lead will advise wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and airspeed.
 48                                          AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


      7.9.3.3. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, lead will establish straight and level
      flight for 30-60 seconds
      7.9.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective, lead should consider passing the lead
      to the wing-man, provided the leader will be able to maintain situational awareness from
      a chase position. Transfer lead while in straight and level flight. Once assuming the lead,
      maintain straight and level flight for 60 seconds. If necessary, terminate the tactical
      mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
   7.9.4. Greater than 2-Ship Formation. Lead should separate the flight into elements to
   more effectively handle a wingman with persistent SD symptoms. Establish straight and level
   flight IAW paragraph 4.4 (Formation Break-up). Plan to keep the element with the SD pilot
   straight and level while the other element separates.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.10.1. Inadvertent Release.
      7.10.1.1. Record switch positions at the time of inad-vertent release and provide to
      armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point, if known.
      7.10.1.2. Safe the armament switches and do not attempt further release in any mode.
      Treat remaining stores as hung ordnance and follow hung ordnance procedures during
      RTB.
      7.10.1.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
      a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.2. Failure to Release/Hung Ordnance. If ord-nance fails to release when all
   appropriate switches are set, proceed as follows.
      7.10.2.1. Hung live ordnance or aircraft malfunction that precludes further live weapons
      delivery.
          7.10.2.1.1. Attempt to release store(s) using an alternate delivery mode. (N/A for
          A/A WSEP) If unsuccessful, attempt to jettison store(s) using selective jettison
          procedures. Lastly, consider attempting to selectively jettison the pylon if ordnance is
          unsecured or security cannot be determined.
          7.10.2.1.2. If ordnance remains on the aircraft, follow the hung ordnance recovery
          procedures.
   7.10.3. Hangfire/Misfire:
      7.10.3.1. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire. If this occurs,
      the missile should be closely observed and safety checked by a chase pilot.
      7.10.3.2. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
      misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch and follow the hung ordnance
      recovery procedures.
   7.10.4. Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery:
      7.10.4.1. If practical, visually inspect the aircraft for damage.
AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                         49


      7.10.4.2. Declare an emergency for hung live ordnance (not required for hung
      practice/inert ordnance or for live unexpended ordnance).
      7.10.4.3. If available, obtain a chase aircraft (N/A at night) and avoid populated areas
      and trail formations.
      7.10.4.4. Land from a straight-in approach.
   7.10.5. Miscellaneous Procedures:
      7.10.5.1. Pilots will not attempt to expend ordnance using a delivery system with a
      known weapons re-lease malfunction.
      7.10.5.2. When abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight is noted after launch,
      visually inspect the launching aircraft by another pilot (if possible) to determine if any
      damage has occurred.
7.11. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Proce-dures.
   7.11.1. Do not shut down the engine(s) unless directed by the ground crew, there is a fire, or
   other conditions dictate.
   7.11.2. Raise the tailhook on the ground crew‟s signal.
   7.11.3. Do not taxi until directed.
   7.11.4. Comply with local directives.
7.12. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
   7.12.1. Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces an effect
   that closely parallels an actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to simulate the drag
   equivalent to a flamed out engine.
   7.12.2. Aborted Takeoff Practice. Only practice aborted takeoffs in the flight simulator,
   Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT), or, if the trainer is unavailable, a static aircraft.
   7.12.3. Simulated in-flight loss of both engines is prohibited.
   7.12.4. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited.
   7.12.5. Emergency Landing Patterns (Refer to AFI 11-202 Volume 3).
      7.12.5.1. Field Requirements. Practice of emer-gency landing patterns at active
      airfields is authorized provided that crash rescue and air traffic control facilities are
      available and in operation.
      7.12.5.2. Supervisory Requirements. IQT (including FTU) pilots require an IP on
      board the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. MQT (including FTU) pilots require a SOF in
      place and an IP or flight lead monitoring from the traffic pattern.
      7.12.5.3. Pattern Procedures:
          7.12.5.3.1. Include the type of practice emergency pattern in the gear check call.
          7.12.5.3.2. Initiate practice single-engine go-arounds in sufficient time to ensure the
          aircraft does not descend below 300 feet AGL. Simulated single-engine approaches
          may descend below 300 feet AGL provided the approach terminates in a full stop
 50                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


           landing or the go-around from a low approach or touch and go landing is performed
           with both engines. When conducting such training, the pilot will advise the
           appropriate air traffic controller of his intentions.
7.13. Search and Rescue (SARCAP) Procedures. If an aircraft crashes, immediately attempt
to locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. Expect that the aircrews may initially
suffer from shock or have delayed reactions due to ejection injuries. The following procedures
are by no means complete and should be adjusted to meet each unique search and rescue
situation.
   7.13.1. Knock off maneuvering.
   7.13.2. Establish a SARCAP commander.
   7.13.3. Squawk 7700 to alert ATC/GCI of the emergency situation.
   7.13.4. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft/flight intentions immediately to
   applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency if necessary.
   7.13.5. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means available
   (TACAN, INS, ATC/GCI position and/or visual references).
   7.13.6. Remain above the highest ejection altitude, if known, or the highest observed
   parachute until determining the position of all possible survivors.
   7.13.7. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in the SARCAP by altitude to preclude midair
   collision. Establish high/low CAPs as necessary to facilitate communications.
   7.13.8. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum SARCAP
   coverage. Do not overfly the adjusted BINGO fuel.
   7.13.9. Relinquish SARCAP operation to designated rescue forces upon their arrival.
   7.13.10. Follow local or briefed procedures.
7.14. Lateral Asymmetry.
   7.14.1. When a fuel imbalance develops that exceeds 5000 ft/lbs. of lateral asymmetry,
   terminate maneuvering and investigate. If the imbalance was caused by a slow feeding
   external or internal wing tank, restrict maneuvering to instruments, deployment missions, or
   limited maneuvering intercepts less than 30 units AOA, IAW tech order guidance, until the
   imbalance is corrected. Pilots will use the High AOA Warning Tone as a tool to limit the
   aircraft to less than 30 units. If the imbalance cannot be corrected, terminate the mission. The
   above events can be flown to reduce gross weight.
   7.14.2. Weapon and stores asymmetry must also be included to compute the total asymmetry
   condition.
   7.14.3. Use the following rules of thumb in Table 7.1 to determine if a fuel asymmetry
   condition exceeds the Dash-1 limit of 5000 ft/lbs.:

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. This chapter is reserved for unit local operating procedures. Procedures herein will
not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in this instruction, nor is this chapter
intended to be a single source document for procedures contained in other directives or
regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided in other established directives;
however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it serves to facilitate location of
information necessary for local operating procedures. Each pilot is authorized a copy of this
chapter. MAJCOMs or other subordinate agencies (NAF, Center, etc.), may direct publications
approval channels and a specific format for Chapter 8 based on unique flying areas, missions,
and/or procedures. Unless changed by MAJCOM or subordinate agency, the following
procedures apply.
   8.1.1. When published, units will forward copies to MAJCOM and appropriate subordinate
   agencies, who will review the Chapter 8 and return comments or required changes back to
   the unit(s), if appropri-ate. The process need not delay distribution unless specified otherwise
   by MAJCOM or a subordinate agency. If a procedure is applicable to all F-15 A-D units, it
   will be incorporated into the basic instruction.
   8.1.2. Organize the local chapter in the following format and, as a minimum, include the
   following:
       8.1.2.1. Section A. Introduction.
       8.1.2.2. Section B. General Policy.
       8.1.2.3. Section C. Ground Operations.
       8.1.2.4. Section D. Flying Operations.
       8.1.2.5. Section E. Weapons Employment.
       8.1.2.6. Section F. Abnormal Procedures.
       8.1.2.7. Attachments. (Illustrations)
   8.1.3. Include procedures for the following, if applicable:
       8.1.3.1. Command and Control.
       8.1.3.2. Fuel Requirements and Bingo Fuels.
       8.1.3.3. Diversion Instructions.
       8.1.3.4. Jettison Areas/Procedures/Parameters (IFR/VFR).

conditions permit
Note: 1000 feet over water; 1500 feet at night /IMC unless on radar
downwind

3.10.8. Dissimilar Formations. Dissimilar aircraft may be flown in the same formation if mission
requirements dictate or to expedite traffic flow during departures and recoveries. Specific
procedures will be thoroughly prebriefed.
3.18.10.8. For over water operation, the minimum altitude is 1000 feet above the surface unless
in sight of land. If in sight of land, the minimum altitude may be lowered to 500 feet above the
surface.
7.14.1. When a fuel imbalance develops that exceeds 5000 ft/lbs. of lateral asymmetry, terminate
maneuvering and investigate. If the imbalance was caused by a slow feeding external or internal
wing tank, restrict maneuvering to instruments, deployment missions, or limited maneuvering
intercepts less than 30 units AOA, IAW tech order guidance, until the imbalance is corrected.
Pilots will use the High AOA Warning Tone as a tool to limit the aircraft to less than 30 units. If
the imbalance cannot be corrected, terminate the mission. The above events can be flown to
reduce gross weight.
