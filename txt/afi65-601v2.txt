 10                                                               AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


                                          Chapter 2

            PREPARING AND EXECUTING THE EXECUTION PLAN (EP)

2.1. Issuing the Budget Call. SAF/FMB will issue annual instructions for preparing and
submitting the execution plan.
   2.1.1. In the budget call, SAF/FMBO will provide:
       2.1.1.1. Funding levels by program element (PE), element of expense code (EEIC) and
       emergency and special program code (ESP) (if applicable).
       2.1.1.2. Special guidance and instructions.
   2.1.2. MAJCOM, combatant commands (COCOM) and other operating agencies (OAC)
   may supplement the SAF/FMBO call with their own specific instructions.
2.2. Balancing the Program. Carefully distribute funding using the SAF/FMBO-provided
bogey. Consolidate requirements from each RC to form the total requirement and a balanced
program.
   2.2.1. Commands must plan to operate within the funding level provided to carry out the
   new fiscal year’s mission.
   2.2.2. The final command plan must balance to the SAF/FMBO bogey provided and must
   comply with all guidance and instructions.
       2.2.2.1. Subactivity Group (SAG) migrations lead to discrepancies between execution
       and programming of funds, resulting in reductions to Air Force total obligating authority
       (TOA) from Congressional marks.
2.3. Enhancing Flexibility and Credibility. Give commanders and managers at all levels
considerable flexibility in distributing funding. Each manager should have the chance to plan
using next year's tentative funding to best accomplish the organization's mission. If necessary,
commanders should recommend program changes (e.g., flying hours, manpower authorizations,
equipment authorizations or organization) for SAF/FMBO approval. Usually, the next higher
level of review will approve credible distribution plans.
2.4. Reviewing the Execution Plan (MAJCOM). Installations and units complete their EPs on
request and forward them to their MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will:
   2.4.1. Review installation program and cost data.
   2.4.2. Determine the validity of requirements as well as conformity to MAJCOM
   instructions.
   2.4.3. Review and validate installation and unit submissions, consolidate the results and
   submit the command execution plan to SAF/FMBO.
2.5. Reviewing the Execution Plan (SAF/FMBO). SAF/FMBO will:
   2.5.1. Correlate the total amounts approved for field commanders with the anticipated
   amounts appropriated by Congress. Note: Congress normally holds hearings on the
   President's Budget between February and April.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                        11


   2.5.2. Adjust the EP using the latest program guidance.
   2.5.3. Send the command distribution within 30 days of signed appropriation.
2.6. Issuing and Updating Funding Documents. SAF/FMB’s intent, to the extent possible, is
to distribute all command funding once the Department of Defense Appropriation Act is enacted.
SAF/FMB utilizes the Automated Funds Management (AFM) system and Program Budget
Automated System (PBAS) to provide commands the official authorization in the form of an
Operating Budget Authority Document (OBAD) or Funding Authorization Document (FAD).
Funding documents will be sent throughout the year as needed and may include additional
information, such as, PE, EEIC and imposed legal limitations (floors and ceilings). SAF/FMB
will provide narrative guidance for statutory/regulatory limitations and will explain reasons for
significant changes to fund requests. MAJCOMs will:
   2.6.1. Reprogram annual obligation authority within budget activity (BA) consistent with
   limitations stated in the OBAD. For example, you may reprogram quarterly direct obligation
   authority between BAs provided no quarterly program exceeds the corresponding annual BA
   authority.
   2.6.2. Notify higher headquarters of significant changes in fund distribution along with an
   explanation on when and why plans changed.
2.7. Executing the Annual Budget. Air Force activities may begin incurring obligations when
SAF/FMB issues budget authority. After Congress enacts the Department of Defense (DoD)
Appropriation Act and SAF/FMB receives its allotment from the Office of the Secretary of
Defense Comptroller, SAF/FMBO will issue OBADs to MAJCOMs. When Congress hasn't
passed the new fiscal year's appropriation act by the start of the new fiscal year, SAF/FMB will
provide interim guidance (usually based on Congressional passage of Continuing Resolution
Authority, which allows DoD activities to spend money pending passage of the DoD
Appropriations Act).
2.8. Reporting Monthly and Quarterly Status. SAF/FMB requires DFAS-CO to make
available RCS: HAF-ACF(AR) 7801, Status of Funds Data Base Transmission Report, that
shows current year-to-date expenses, obligations, commitments and prior year data (see DFAS-
DE 7010.1-R, General Accounting and Finance Systems at Base Level, Chapter 29 and DFAS-
DE 7077.2-M, USAF Standard Base-Level General Accounting and Finance System, Sections 75
and 76). Commands and wings may use programs, such as, Commander’s Resource Integration
System (CRIS) or Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) to
develop their status of funds IAW with command and local guidance.
   2.8.1. Commands and bases will analyze reports for lags or accelerations in planned
   programs. SAF/FMB may require explanations when commands are ahead of or behind
   schedule.
2.9. Closeout Procedures and Closeout Report. In managing Air Force funds, we want to:
   2.9.1. Use available funds most effectively for recognized operational needs.
   2.9.2. Ensure all obligations recorded by 30 September are valid, so the Air Force does not
   lose funds because of administrative errors or inflated obligation estimates. Valid obligations
   should be properly recorded in the accounting system no later than midnight to avoid
   unnecessary end of year funding shortfalls or potential certification violations.
 12                                                                AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


   2.9.3. Ensure the closeout procedure is successful.
   2.9.4. Closeout Procedures. SAF/FMB issues yearend closeout instructions and guidance
   to MAJCOMs (and Field Operating Agencies (FOAs)). Usually, MAJCOMs will issue their
   own instructions covering standard closeout actions. Bases must create their own closeout
   checklist which includes all SAF/FMB, MAJCOM, DFAS and Contracting Squadron
   guidance, as well as any base specific areas that require emphasis during the closeout
   process. SAF/FMB has not established a single set of Air Force closeout procedures because
   each MAJCOM is different. MAJCOMs usually will:
       2.9.4.1. Appoint a special closeout officer and request each base appoint a closeout point
       of contact.
       2.9.4.2. Establish a schedule of events with specific deadline dates.
       2.9.4.3. Provide the bases with additional guidance with regard to specific programs
       (e.g., Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), Medical and Military Family Housing) or
       request additional information and reports when needed.
       2.9.4.4. Review previous year’s closeout reports for lessons learned, especially
       concerning preventable fall-out/fall-in.
   2.9.5. Closeout Report. An execution plan mainly shows how a user intends to accomplish
   a program and use the provided commitment and obligation authority. Analyze how well the
   user did in the closeout report. Provide:
       2.9.5.1. Reasons for actual performance differing substantially from planned
       performance.
       2.9.5.2. Reviews to compare actual fiscal year accomplishments to projections and
       measure the effective use of total operating budget authority (OBA).
       2.9.5.3. Per paragraph 2.16, use the analysis of preventable fall-out/fall-in for lessons
       learned in preparing for the next fiscal year closeout.
2.10. Managing Air Force Resources. Command and base personnel need to know specific
actions for administering the financial management program. Other chapters of this AFI cover
certain technical procedures; e.g., computing expense and obligation authority or making inputs
to FMA. Apply the following administrative procedures (not all-inclusive) for good
management at command and base-level:
   2.10.1. Fix responsibility when possible. The commander is ultimately responsible for
   formulating and executing the execution plan. Identify other managers with their specific
   financial management responsibilities (e.g., the civil engineer with facility, sustainment,
   restoration and modernization; the transportation officer with vehicle and transportation
   requirements). Identify corollary offices of responsibility (e.g., aircraft maintenance
   requirements based on the flying hours managed by operations). Establish a FWG and FMB
   to review EPs. Confirm responsibilities in writing.
   2.10.2. Identify base programs and tasks.
   2.10.3. Price approved programs by responsibility center, PE and budget activity.
   2.10.4. Have the FWG review and FMB approve the priced program.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                       13


   2.10.5. Write defensible and concise narrative justification for the EP to explain why you
   need the funds.
   2.10.6. Evaluate and advise the commander and staff on the approved obligation authority.
   Highlight the funding level effects on base mission.
   2.10.7. Present the recommended funding distribution to the FWG.
   2.10.8. Present the FWGs recommended funding distribution to the FMB and commander
   for approval.
   2.10.9. Use the FMBs and commander's assessment of priorities to distribute the expense
   and obligation authority to the responsibility centers.
   2.10.10. Establish procedures, with the commander's guidance, to buy the highest priority
   goods and services within the available obligation authority.
   2.10.11. Review and analyze reports that compare actual expenses and obligations with
   established targets.
   2.10.12. Meet with RAs and RCMs frequently to discuss problems and propose solutions.
   Brief the FMB and commander on the status of funds, including reasons for variances
   between actual and planned performance.
   2.10.13. Ensure FMA, RAs and RCMs immediately follow-up to correct fund imbalances.
   2.10.14. Use Financial Management Suite (FMSuite) Open Document Analysis (ODA) to
   review Open Document Listings (ODL) and perform Tri-Annual Reviews (TAR).
       2.10.14.1. Use of comment and attachment functions are mandatory for ODLs and TARs
       in FMSuite ODA. Using these features will ensure documentation is available for
       continuity purposes and provides the Air Force with auditable records. (Reference:
       SAF/FMP Policy Letter, 17 November 2009).
       2.10.14.2. Review ODLs at least quarterly IAW DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, Paragraphs 18-9
       and 19-5. Note: Certain documents may need to be reviewed on a more enhanced
       schedule. For example, FMA should consider reconciling AF Forms 616, Fund Cite
       Authorization, every month to ensure obligations are being posted (see DFAS-DE 7010-
       1-R, Chapter 17, Section A), as well as, DD Forms 448, Military Interdepartmental
       Purchase Request, IAW AFI 65-116, Air Force Purchases Using Military
       Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRS), Chapter 3.
       2.10.14.3. Perform TARs IAW DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR)
       7000.14-R, Volume 3, Budget Execution--Availability And Use Of Budgetary Resources,
       Paragraph 0804 and DFAS 7220.4-I, Tri-annual Review Program.
2.11. Administering Management Control Points: There are three management control
points, which include the responsibility center manager (RCM), cost center (CC), and resource
advisor(RA). Duties are discussed further in Chapter 10.
   2.11.1. The RCM normally heads an organization that plans, organizes, directs, and
   coordinates activities of subordinate organizations and functions (e.g., directorate and group
   and squadron commanders). RCMs are the principal level that manages financial resources.
 14                                                               AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


   Directs work by cost centers and appoints RAs (command, group or squadron organizational
   levels) to oversee and manage unit resources.
   2.11.2. The cost center organizations, gathers and distributes cost data (e.g., flights).
   Regulates daily use of workhours, supplies, equipment, and services producing or doing
   things. Monitors relationship between resources used and products produced.
   2.11.3. The RA participates actively in resource management at command and base level,
   including the planning, programming, budgeting, acquiring, consuming, storing, and
   disposing of resources and is directly responsible to the RCM. RAs provide oversight and
   training for cost center managers (CCM).
2.12. Establishing Review Committees. Achieve participatory management by establishing
financial committees, (FWG and FMB), at each level of command to review estimates and create
and carry out budgets. Designate required membership for each committee. MAJCOMs may
waive establishing the FWG where, due to the organization's size, both committees would have
essentially the same membership. (See paragraph 10.3)
   2.12.1. The comptroller or the financial management analysis officer chairs the FWG and
   designates appropriate RAs and other members to comprise the FWG. The FWG:
       2.12.1.1. Reviews program and cost factors, compares actuals with prior year costs,
       reviews justifications, periodically evaluates performance against estimates and submits a
       recommended execution plan to the FMB.
       2.12.1.2. Maintains FWG minutes for higher authority review.
       2.12.1.3. Meets when needed to support the FMB.
   2.12.2. The FMB is the senior advisory committee. The commander or the deputy
   commander chairs the committee. Group commander level members and the comptroller (at
   installations), directors and special staffs (at commands) comprise the membership.
       2.12.2.1. The FMB approves budgets, execution plans and revisions. The FMB also
       distributes the annual funding, establishes priorities and ensures consistency with
       programs and missions.
       2.12.2.2. FMB approval represents the final, approved installation or command budget
       submitted to higher command and the final distribution of funds received from higher
       command.
       2.12.2.3. The chairperson calls FMB meetings. The FMB retains minutes for review by
       higher authority.
2.13. Preparing Data for Review Authorities. Provide the material to the members of the
FMB and FWG for their review prior to the formal session. The financial management analysis
officer:
   2.13.1. In formulating the budget, consolidates separate RC estimates for the appropriate
   committee review.
   2.13.2. In distributing the approved execution plan, prepares a comparative analysis of
   financial authority requested and received, separately identifying fixed and variable
   requirements.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                       15


2.14. Briefing Committees:
   2.14.1. The financial management analysis officer instructs personnel how to brief the FMB
   and FWG effectively. Briefing consists of:
       2.14.1.1. Pertinent instructions in the "call" from higher headquarters.
       2.14.1.2. Review of how the execution plan works.
       2.14.1.3. Recommended distribution of suggested obligation authority (if the OBA has
       been received).
   2.14.2. Emphasize these points in the briefing:
       2.14.2.1. Don't overstate budget requirements (affects your credibility).
       2.14.2.2. Be careful using prior year obligation data as it can be misleading (may include
       one-time costs). Usually future programs are different from current programs.
       2.14.2.3. Base decisions on the requirements merit and not on the staff officer's
       enthusiasm (or dire predictions).
       2.14.2.4. Check new program's current rates of execution. Consider other factors, such
       as, construction lead-time and hiring difficulties.
       2.14.2.5. Highlight major programmatic changes affecting the execution plan (e.g.,
       addition of a new program or wing).
   2.14.3. Have program data (personnel strength, flying hours, construction programs, etc.)
   available for committee personnel for the period covered.
2.15. Controlling and Executing the OBA. Upon receiving OBA, the installation (FWG, FMB
and commander) will establish a plan, phased by quarter for the fiscal year, which funds the
highest priority requirements. Develop a well-defined, written plan supported by command
policy and enforced by the local commander. Institute written management controls at the start
of the year to prevent waste of resources. Common management controls include:
   2.15.1. Civilian Personnel Costs. The commander establishes a corporate board to ensure
   civilian resources are used most efficiently and effectively. See Chapter 9 and Attachment 9
   for additional details.
   2.15.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel.              The commander designates key officials to
   approve TDY. Consider:
       2.15.2.1. Need for TDY travel.
       2.15.2.2. Screening requests for travel by privately owned automobile and other special
       authorizations.
       2.15.2.3. Using military transportation when available.
       2.15.2.4. Requiring military personnel and encouraging civilian personnel to use
       available government or contract quarters.
       2.15.2.5. Reviewing the number of people involved and length of TDY.
       2.15.2.6. Using video teleconferencing, teleconferences, and other electronic resources.
 16                                                                AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


   2.15.3. Contract Services. Tightly control use of contracts. The RCM reviews existing
   contracts periodically (once a year or more) to determine if contracts still fill a need. The
   FWG screens all contracts for need during execution plan preparation.
   2.15.4. Supplies. Distribute reports from supply systems to RAs and CCMs. These reports
   show supply transactions and management indicators affecting materiel and financial
   resources. Monitor and analyze reports to ensure customers order only essential supplies in
   the quantities necessary to accomplish missions.
       2.15.4.1. RAs, CCMs and RCMs must take appropriate management actions (including
       curtailing orders) to remain within authorized targets, when there are no additional funds.
       2.15.4.2. Cancel supplies-on-order and turn in excess supplies on-hand when a valid
       need no longer exists (because of a mission change or other reasons).
       2.15.4.3. Investigate financial management indicators (such as credit or noncredit turn-
       ins) that are abnormally high or low.
   2.15.5. Equipment. Pay attention to equipment management.             This ensures you apply
   limited financing to priority requirements.
   2.15.6. Utilities. Establish an effective Civil Engineering Utilities Conservation Program.
   2.15.7. Staff Coordination. Managers planning operational exercises, establishing new
   logistics ideas or initiating other special programs must coordinate with the financial
   management analysis office to ensure programming and support for the planned activities.
   2.15.8. Other. Add controls when needed to manage such items as staff car use, purchase
   and rental of office equipment, base bus routes, use of ground vehicle fuels and rental of
   mobile equipment, etc.
2.16. Analysis of Prior Year Unobligated Balances (Fall-out/Fall-in).
   2.16.1. Every year the Air Force risks losing billions of dollars over the future years defense
   program due to unexpended balances and historical under-execution. Many of these cuts are
   based on the deobligation of expired funds, referred to as fall-out. In some cases obligations
   are underestimated and result in a ―fall-in‖ situation, which requires additional funds to cover
   the actual obligations. Historically, AF execution results in much more fall-out than fall-in
   but it is important to understand and learn from the causes of both. Quarterly, FMA must
   identify significant fall-out, determine the cause of the fall-out, and use the results for
   training fund holders, resource advisors, contracting officers, and any other responsible
   personnel. In research and lessons learned take the following into account:
       2.16.1.1. Use the ODL and TAR in FMSuite ODA as tools to determine the validity of
       obligations.
       2.16.1.2. Are there policies that result in obligations that subsequently may not be
       required?
       2.16.1.3. Was the amount of a miscellaneous obligation based on reasonable assurance?
       Is the need for the reservation of funds well documented? Or was the amount established
       on remote or extreme possibilities?
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      17


     2.16.1.4. Use the amount of fall-out/fall-in as historical data for improving the estimate
     on reoccurring obligations.
     2.16.1.5. Was the obligation amount based solely to satisfy an available balance? Be
     especially aware and guard against this practice at fiscal year closeout.
     2.16.1.6. Suspense and actively monitor miscellaneous obligations for the actual
     obligation or expense. As funding ages, unsupported obligations become more material
     with more adverse effects.
  2.16.2. Not all fall-out/fall-in is preventable, but any time we can apply the lessons learned
  from expired year fall-out/fall-in to prevent its reoccurrence will save us from losing vital
  current year funding.
 18                                                                AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


                                           Chapter 3

      ISSUING AND DISTRIBUTING OPERATING BUDGET AUTHORITY (OBA)

3.1. Overview. Apply this chapter in distributing Military Personnel (MILPERS) and Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) Appropriation fund authorities. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
Budget Guidance and Procedures, for other appropriations. See AFPD 65-6 for Air Force policy
on providing optimum funding flexibility at all levels and controlling OBA amounts so they
don't exceed the authority received by the issuing activity. When issuing OBA, SAF/FMB and
subordinate levels will identify restrictions imposed by the legislative and executive branches of
the government and by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). Subordinate activities
must ensure that the OBAs issued are consistent with the budget authority received with regard
to funding classifications and limitations.
3.2. Controlling Yearend Spending. Don't spend financial resources at the end of a fiscal year
merely because they are available. Identify and report unused financial resources (e.g., from
savings, program slippages, or other causes) to higher headquarters for possible withdrawal.
Notify your headquarters in time to permit using the funds for higher priority mission
requirements.
3.3. Issuing OBA (SAF/FMB):
   3.3.1. SAF/FMBO will issue O&M OBAs for the current fiscal year on OBADs at the
   budget activity level for direct funding authority.
   3.3.2. SAF/FMBOP will issue a centrally managed OBA to OAC 48 for military personnel
   expenses.
       3.3.2.1. DFAS-IN will automatically load authority into the Air Force accounting system
       and report on military personnel expenses incurred at actual rates.
       3.3.2.2. Installations won't receive an OBAD for military personnel expenses but must
       report expenses through the database transfer report. (See Chapter 8 for information on
       military personnel expenses.)
   3.3.3. Continue to comply with prior fiscal year OBADs, including any limitations. Prior
   year OBADs remain in effect as separate documents until the account cancels. Don't obligate
   unused prior year obligation authority to fund current year obligations; you may use it for
   prior year obligation adjustments if approved. (See DFAS-DE 7000.4-R, Accounting for
   Obligations and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 6.)
3.4. Issuing OBAs (MAJCOMs). Upon receipt of an OBA from SAF/FMB, MAJCOMs will
subdivide the OBA to installations. Include the same content as the OBAD received. Comply
with objectives in paragraph’s 2.2.2 and 3.1. MAJCOMs that centrally monitor reimbursable
programs will structure installation OBADs.
3.5. Distributing OBAs at Installation Level:
   3.5.1. Upon receipt of an OBA at installation level (the ultimate user), FMA distributes the
   OBA to maintain control on legal limitations, to ensure use according to the approved OBA
   and to provide for local management requirements. FMA loads the OBA distribution or
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      19


   subdivision into the general accounting and finance system-base level (GAFS-BL). (See
   OBA loading in Chapter 5).
   3.5.2. Installations sometimes fund subordinate units (e.g., a group, squadron or detachment)
   located on or near another installation. Issue funding on an AF Form 616. When the tenant
   is large or it's impractical to use AF Form 616, the parent command issues the host base an
   OBAD for the tenant's funding requirements.
3.6. Distributing Tenant OBAs. The installation distributes OBA received for tenant
organization support in the same manner it distributes its own OBA. Follow responsibilities
assigned in the host-tenant agreement.
   3.6.1. When the tenant performs its own budget function, the tenant will distribute or load
   the budgeted amounts. If the tenant has no budget capability, the host FMA office will load
   the tenant's approved OBA.
   3.6.2. The organization issuing the tenant's OBA will attach their requested distribution by
   program element, major RC and EEIC.
 20                                                                AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


                                           Chapter 4

        ADMINISTERING TARGETS, LIMITATIONS, AND OBA CONTROLS

4.1. Complying With Targets and Limitations In OBAs:
   4.1.1. Follow official policies on administrative control of OBAs in DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
   Volume 14, Administrative Control Of Funds and Antideficiency Act Violations, Chapter 1,
   and included on your OBAD. SAF/FMB will issue the total OBA consistent with
   classifications, authorities and constraints with the total OBA received from the Office of the
   Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)). Operating agencies below
   SAF/FMB level must ensure the same consistency between OBAs issued by them with those
   received from SAF/FMB.
      4.1.1.1. All organizations must follow the rigid restrictions subject to DoD FMR
      7000.14-R, Volume 14 and AFI 65-608, Antideficiency Act Violations.
      4.1.1.2. All organizations must not exceed targets or advisory guides.
      4.1.1.3. All activities must comply with two basic types of restrictions:
          4.1.1.3.1. Limitations. These are subject to the fund control requirements of Title 31
          of the United States Code (U.S.C.) and DoD FMR 7000.14-R, and include limitations
          imposed by statute and any absolute restriction imposed administratively that
          modifies or restricts the terms of fund authorizations. You must report any violation
          of these limitations.
          4.1.1.3.2. . Targets. Don't exceed a target without the issuing agency's prior
          approval. If you discover a target variance, notify the issuing authority in writing
          immediately.
   4.1.2. Recipients who reissue OBAs to a lower level may not remove or add to restrictions in
   the documents they receive. Refer to the OBAD for specific information on legal limitations
   and targets.
      4.1.2.1. Annual direct O&M authority by BA for a particular fiscal year is a legal
      limitation under Title 31 U.S.C.
          4.1.2.1.1. You can reprogram quarterly authority between BAs during the first three
          quarters of the FY as long as you don't exceed the annual authority by BA.
          4.1.2.1.2. During the 4th quarter, you may not exceed the total funding in each BA (it
          must equal the amount shown on the funding document received from higher
          headquarters).
      4.1.2.2. The O&M reimbursable program is an annual program for the appropriation.
      Controls must be carefully followed to avoid obligating or expending in excess of the
      amount of appropriated funds available, plus the amount of reimbursements that
      ultimately will be earned and collected. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14, Chapter
      1 and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 5.
      4.1.2.3. Activities may not exceed the total O&M authority for a particular fiscal year (it
      is a legal limitation under Title 31 U.S.C. on a cumulative quarterly basis).
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                         21


      4.1.2.4. Within the O&M total direct obligation authority, comply with the following
      legal limitations:
          4.1.2.4.1. ―A‖ Legal limitations.
          4.1.2.4.2. ―B‖ Air Force limitations.
          4.1.2.4.3. ―E‖ Earmarks (Congressional).
          4.1.2.4.4. ―OF‖ SAF/FM Flying Hour limitations.
          4.1.2.4.5. ―R‖ SAF/FM Readiness limitations.
          4.1.2.4.6. Line item limitations.
          4.1.2.4.7. Don't exceed any other limitation without prior approval from the issuing
          authority. Note: The issuer will identify these legal limitations on the OBAD.
4.2. Administering Controls:
   4.2.1. SAF/FMB and MAJCOMs, as applicable, will issue each field activity an OBAD that
   identifies the O&M direct obligation authority.
   4.2.2. The total O&M obligation authority is subject to precertification procedures. Comply
   with modified commitment accounting procedures for O&M appropriations in Interim
   Guidance on Accounting for Commitments (formerly DFAS-DE 7000.5-R and AFR 170-13)
   to preclude violating cumulative quarterly obligation authority shown on the OBAD.
   4.2.3. Fund certifying officers in the installation financial management analysis offices must
   not certify availability of funds for more than cumulative quarterly obligation authority.
      4.2.3.1. For certifying funds beyond the cumulative quarterly obligation authority, see
      Interim Guidance on Accounting for Commitments.
      4.2.3.2. All personnel authorized to certify the availability of funds, to commit funds, to
      authorize or incur obligations, or to spend Air Force funds, must be familiar with Interim
      Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made
      Available to the Department of the Air Force (formerly DFAS-DE 7200.1-R and AFR
      177-16).
4.3. Administering Targets and Limitations in Other Appropriations. Air Force activities
manage and control other appropriations by issuing funding authorizations, budget
authorizations, allocations, suballocations, allotments and suballotments.
   4.3.1. The issuer will clearly identify each specific limitation (imposed by the legislative and
   executive branches of the Federal Government, the Department of Defense and the
   Department of the Air Force) on the "Limitation" portion of the allocation document.
   4.3.2. Recipients issuing funding authorizations, budget authorizations, suballocations,
   allotments or suballotments may not remove nor add to restrictions in the documents.
 22                                                                 AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


                                           Chapter 5

      LOADING THE OPERATING BUDGET AUTHORITY INTO THE GENERAL
                 ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR OPERATIONS

5.1. Using the OBA and OBAD. Funds issuers use OBAs to transfer authority to incur
obligations and expenses to subordinate units and provide the basis for fiscal control required by
law. SAF/FMB:
   5.1.1. Issues the OBA from SAF/FMB-held appropriations to each MAJCOM and FOA on
   an OBAD or FAD. The OBAD provides the annual operating budget authority and the
   phased quarterly obligation authority in three distinct categories; direct authority by BA, total
   direct program and total operating budget:
       5.1.1.1. Direct authority by BA provides authority to incur expenses and obligations for
       each BA, subject to the restrictions and qualifications written on the document and in
       Interim Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds
       Made Available to the Department of the Air Force. Each BA identifies financial
       resources as follows: O&M expense, other obligation and expense authority.
       5.1.1.2. Total direct program provides the sum of all BAs identified by the same
       subdivisions as in direct authority by BA.
       5.1.1.3. Total operating budget provides the sum of accepted reimbursable orders and
       direct authority.
   5.1.2. Issues only direct obligation and expense authority.
   5.1.3. Loads reimbursement authority IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 5.
5.2. Computing Total Authority to Load. Usually, issuers will provide OBAD authorities in
the same format as the general accounting system data base fund summary records (FSR).
Activities receiving OBAs will:
   5.2.1. Load expense and obligation authority to provide targets for tracking expenses and
   obligations plus provide limitations for appropriate fund control.
   5.2.2. Prepare and load target distribution by RC/CC and EEIC.
5.3. Relating OBAD Amounts and Computer Records. The current fiscal year OBAD shows
current year expense and obligation authority for O&M. Load detail fund targets into the general
accounting system data base program summary records (PSR) for the current year and five prior
years. Note: Keep in mind that obligation authority for prior year undelivered orders
outstanding carryover is in the OBAD for the applicable prior fiscal year, not on the current
fiscal year OBAD.
   5.3.1. Fund Type Codes. DFAS-DE 7077.2-M lists all applicable fund type codes for the
   general accounting system. But, the examples for loading the OBA used in this chapter show
   only the two fund type codes pertaining to the (3400) appropriation: fund type L (direct
   obligation authority and total actual authority) plus fund type M (reimbursement authority).
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      23


   5.3.2. Handling Current Year Authorities and Records. Load authority pertaining to current
   operating budget year and current fiscal year (COBY/CFY) in OBADs to COBY/CFY
   records. Examples for FY 11 are COBY=1 and CFY=1.
       5.3.2.1. Combine direct and reimbursable authorities for each BA. Load by RC/CC and
       EEIC to fund type L records without sales code (SC) and to fund type L records with a
       SC when loading the obligation as an undelivered order outstanding with a corresponding
       reimbursable account entry (payroll-only excluded).
       5.3.2.2. Load reimbursable authority by BA, RC/CC, EEIC and SC so that fund type M
       funding targets match earned reimbursements.
   5.3.3. Handling Prior Year Authorities and Records. On the first day of the fiscal year, the
   general accounting system computer year end conversion procedures programmatically
   removes (from prior operating budget year and prior fiscal year (POBY/PFY) accounts) the
   PFY obligation authority obligated as undelivered orders outstanding on record as of the last
   day of the PFY.
       5.3.3.1. Record this amount in the COBY/PFY accounts. Also establish and adjust all
       other POBY and PFY authorities by the yearend conversion program.
       5.3.3.2. Combine recorded amounts manually to determine correctness of load for PFY
       authorities because of the split of PFY obligation authority, COBY/PFY and POBY/PFY.
       Make adjustments to the PFY as needed.
5.4. Distributing OBAD Authority. Upon receiving the OBAD, the FWG and the financial
management analysis office recommend distributions of quarterly and annual authority for FMB
approval. Objectives are to:
   5.4.1. Establish OBA targets at the RCM level.
   5.4.2. Target certain special activities (tenants and common expense accounts) at the six-
   digit RC/CC.
   5.4.3. Establish targets at organization points where management makes decisions.
   5.4.4. Align amounts with the squadron or comparable level RC (usual practice). Targeting
   at the fifth or sixth digit level of the RC/CC rarely assists in managing funds and produces
   much unnecessary work.
   5.4.5. Load targets at the RC/CC level required to maintain program element identification
   and to support other command directed action.
5.5. Loading Targets in the General Accounting System. An AF Form 1269, Request for
Load or Change in Fund Targets, (or a mechanized equivalent (e.g., Automated AF Form 1269
or Budget Tools used with WinGAMPs) is used to load annual and quarterly OBA targets into
GAFS-BL for all appropriations.
   5.5.1. Financial management analysis offices will load Continuing Resolution Authority or
   Initial Distribution using the AF Form 1269 or a mechanized equivalent. If changes need to
   be made after Initial Distribution has been loaded, then resource advisors will prepare and
   forward an AF Form 1269 (or mechanized equivalent) to the installation financial
   management analysis office for review.
24                                                               AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


     5.5.1.1. The person who prepares the form will add the date and their name, organization
     and contact information in the "Remarks" section of the form. Have the budget analyst
     who checks the form include the date and their name, organization and contact
     information in the "FMA Approved By" block to show FMA review and approval. Once
     the FMA technician verifies the AF Form 1269 (or mechanized equivalent) is valid and
     correct, the FMA technician will transmit quarterly and annual obligation authority fund
     targets into GAFS-BL.
     5.5.1.2. FMA technicians will cross-check their target load submissions with the Daily
     Audit Listing for accuracy. Local Funds Control Analysts and budget technicians will
     ensure GAFS-BL is balanced with the final funding document of the month prior to the
     end of month database transfer.
     5.5.1.3. FMA offices must maintain OBADs, FADs, original AF Forms 1269 (or
     substitute method) and Daily Audit Listings on file for one prior fiscal year and the
     current the fiscal year. For all other prior fiscal years, the OBAD and FAD will be the
     source of record for what has been loaded in GAFS-BL and must balance. In conjunction
     with the OBAD and FAD, analysts may use Selective Transaction History in CRIS as a
     means to provide auditable records of how funding was loaded into GAFS-BL (i.e., data
     elements to include, but not limited to: Document ID, appropriation data, etc.), as well as
     who loaded the funding into GAFS-BL (e.g., Remote ID).
  5.5.2. A mandatory 12-digit funding document number will also be used when loading
  targets into GAFS-BL. The ultimate objective is establishing a process to trace funds loaded
  into GAFS-BL, back to the OBAD generated from the AFM system and the FAD from
  PBAS. This Funding Document Number (FDN) construct applies to all funding documents
  regardless of appropriation. The use of FDNs and transaction identifiers provides audit
  capability for allotment transactions supporting Budget Authorization/Allocation or OBADs
  and FADs issued by the MAJCOMs. It will also ensure effective audit trails exist between
  the funding authority systems, GAFS-BL and GAFS-R.
     5.5.2.1. Mandatory 12-digit funding document number construct:
         5.5.2.1.1. For funding authorizations utilizing the AFM system, the document
         sequence will be a combination of the register and document numbers, and will also
         identify direct or reimbursable authority. The FMSuite advance call out notification
         will no longer be used as authority to load funds. The example below details how to
         create the FDN sequence:
             5.5.2.1.1.1. Register Number 645318 and Document Number 91, on the AFM
             OBAD becomes: 00645318091D for direct authority, and will be loaded into
             GAFS-BL with the target. For reimbursements, replace the ―D‖ with an ―R‖ (the
             preceding characters will not change). The two zeros at the beginning of the
             register number and the single leading zero on the document number are place
             holders to accommodate the increasing volume of register/documents numbers
             over time.
         5.5.2.1.2. For funding authorizations utilizing PBAS, start with the fiscal year
         (beginning of fiscal year for multi-year), then the fund code and finally the last 5
         digits of the Authority Change Number (document number) from the FAD. AFMAN
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      25


        65-604, Appropriation Symbols And Budget Codes, provides a list of all AF fund
        codes. The examples below detail how to create the document sequence for other
        appropriations:
           5.5.2.1.2.1. Single Year Funds: Authority Change Number 0100-11-000A-00001
           and Appropriation Number 97 2011/2011 0100.6092 2011 becomes FDN
           20112T00001D. For reimbursements, replace the ―D‖ with an ―R‖.
           5.5.2.1.2.2. No year funds: Authority Change Number 0833-X-000A-00009 and
           Appropriation Number 97 X/2001 0833.0200 2001 becomes FDN
           XXXX5N00009D (use 4 X’s versus a number to denote no year). For
           reimbursements, replace the ―D‖ with an ―R‖.
           5.5.2.1.2.3. Multi-year funds: Authority Change Number 0500-09-000A-00001
           and Appropriation Number 97 2009/2013 0500.0200 2011 becomes FDN
           20098400001D (use first year of appropriation for the first 4 digits of the FDN).
           For reimbursements, you replace the ―D‖ with an ―R‖.
        5.5.2.1.3. EXCEPTIONS: There are two exceptions to the application of the new
        FDN construct, when there is a bona-fide emergency and funding documentation
        cannot be accomplished immediately and when funds are realigned for mission
        requirements.
           5.5.2.1.3.1. In accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, when urgent funding
           adjustments are required, you may need to use interim methods (email, phone,
           etc.) to initiate the process. Continue to maintain funds control discipline in these
           situations, ensure activities don't inadvertently violate DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
           Volume 14. In these rare cases, use EMERGENCY as your FDN. The issuing
           activity will issue a formal funding document, reflecting the adjustments within 5
           workdays or at the next document issue cycle, whichever occurs first. Once a
           document is received, the FDN should be entered right away and reverse the
           emergency FDN transactions.
           5.5.2.1.3.2. After the AFM or PBAS target has been posted, and when/if
           movement of funds is required for mission accomplishment, a transaction
           construct must be used to identify the movement of funds (this provides an audit
           trail between target loads from funding documents and target moves per mission
           requirements). When funds are moved, the first seven characters of the
           transaction identification will be REALIGN, and will be entered into the same
           field (replacing the document number). You may use any characters after the
           mandatory seven for local tracking purposes. Do not use ―reprogram.‖
        5.5.2.1.4. Other Procedures. Use the following guidance to create FDNs for
        Continuing Resolutions (CR), Automatic Apportionments (O&M Reimbursements)
        and Procurement/Investment Reimbursements:
           5.5.2.1.4.1. CR is used upon receipt of a Continuing Resolution document. The
           FDN for CR will have ―CR‖ replacing the two leading zeros (CR645318091D).
           Upon receipt of the CR reversal document, remove CR using this document
           number (CR639418031D).
 26                                                              AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


             5.5.2.1.4.2. Automatic Apportionment (O&M Reimbursements): Reimbursement
             Document Number (can be MIPR, MORD, etc), but the 12th position must be
             ―R.‖ There can be other letters/numbers after the ―R,‖ as long as the ―R‖ is in the
             12th position. The 12th position of containing an ―R‖ is the only criteria for
             reimbursements.     Example:           Reimbursable        document      received
             N0003811MP01005. Funding Document Number: N0003811MP0R1005.
             5.5.2.1.4.3. Procurement/Investment Reimbursements:    The Reimbursement
             Document Number is already constructed in the upper right hand corner of the
             funding document. Use this number as the FDN when loading targets in BQ. The
             12th digit of the document number must show an ―R‖ denoting a reimbursable
             document.
   5.5.3. Optional procedures. Use local or command forms instead of the AF Form 1269 to
   satisfy unique requirements. (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M, SBS(GV) Standard Base Supply
   System User's Manual, and DFAS-DE 7077.2-M for AF Form 1269 instructions.)
5.6. Loading Targets in the Base Supply System. Load detailed fund targets into the
Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) (formerly known as the standard base supply
system) and Standard Materiel Accounting System (SMAS) by organization cost center records
(OCCR) and project fund manager records (PFMR). Do this for purchases of supplies and
equipment from DWCF for the current operating year.
   5.6.1. Use AF Form 1269 (or mechanized equivalent) to properly monitor and control
   requests establishing or changing supply and equipment fund targets loaded in OCCRs and
   PFMRs. This is the source document to establish, increase or decrease PFMR and OCCR
   fund targets that authorize purchases from the DWCF. Use local or command forms instead
   of AF Form 1269 when needed to satisfy unique requirements.
   5.6.2. As mentioned in Paragraph 5.5, the person who prepares the form will add their name,
   organization and contact information in the "Remarks" section of the form.
      5.6.2.1. The FMA technician will ensure the AF Form 1269 (or mechanized equivalent)
      is valid and correct prior to inputting the target loads into ECSS or SMAS. Have the
      analyst who checks the form sign in the "FMA Approved By" block to show FMA
      review and approval. Once the supply targets have been loaded into either ECSS or
      SMAS, ensure the supply systems balance with GAFS-BL.
      5.6.2.2. The FMA office must follow filing procedures provided in Paragraphs 5.5.1.2
      and 5.5.1.3.
   5.6.3. Use the automated SMAS and ECSS to control and monitor supply and equipment
   fund targets.
      5.6.3.1. SMAS accumulates and provides financial data for all medical and dental supply
      and equipment accounts.
      5.6.3.2. SMAS establishes and maintains PFMR and OCCR fund targets for purchases of
      all medical/dental supplies and equipment.

                             DATA ELEMENTS AND CODES

6.1. Overview. This chapter provides source references for data elements and account codes
used in budget and financial management.
6.2. Using Data Elements. See Figure 6.1 for data elements commonly used in budget and
financial management.
   6.2.1. Use these codes, as appropriate, to program, budget, and account for appropriations
   used by Air Force activities.
   6.2.2. Each command or operating agency provides subordinate units with the data elements
   authorized for use in budgeting and accounting for funds they administer.
   6.2.3. At base level, the financial management analysis office ensures proper use of those
   data elements authorized by the funding command or operating agency.
   6.2.4. Only valid RC/CCs found in the Financial Management Data Dictionary (FMDD) at
   the Data Quality (DQS) website may be used. If current RC/CCs do not meet mission needs,
   please re-route all requests for additions or modifications through the MAJCOM Data Panel
   representative for consideration of inclusion in the FMDD.
   6.2.5. See AFMAN 65-604 for annual appropriation symbols, budget codes and descriptions.
6.3. Using the Account Structure. See Attachment 5 for examples of typical accounting
classification account structures. These examples will help you determine the accounting
classification (sometimes called a fund cite) required on commitment and obligating documents.
   6.3.1. Air Force tenant organizations should follow the same instructions as found in 6.2.4.
   for the use of RC/CCs.

          USING THE OPERATING BUDGET AND ALLOTMENT LEDGERS

7.1. Using Ledgers. Use operating budget and allotment ledgers to summarize accounting
records to provide the fund's status as of the current date or as of the previous end-of-month.
There are two separate products: (1) operating budget ledger (OBL) for operating budget
accounts (fund types L and M); (2) allotment ledger for other appropriations and other
reimbursement accounts (all fund types except L and M). The OBL/AL may be obtained from
the following sources: (1) GAFS-BL (BQ) (reference DFAS-DE 7077.2-M), (2) Commanders
Resource Integration System (CRIS) or (3) DFAS Online Report Viewing.
   7.1.1. These ledgers provide detailed, special and summary data on various accounts or types
   of funds at a specific point in time. FMA will determine the detail volume, the summation
   amount and the number of accounts from all squadrons and agencies they support.
       7.1.1.1. Use amounts shown on the ledger to analyze obligation and expense accounts
       and to verify fund availability when online inquiries are not available.
   7.1.2. The ledgers provide accounting indicative data, including FSR and PSR addresses.
   Use this information when preparing budget target loads and when analyzing expense and
   obligation rates.
7.2. Frequency. Resource advisors or FMA will obtain a report when required or requested.
7.3. Loading Annual and Quarterly Authorities. Load targets correctly into the accounting
system. No target may be loaded or adjusted without first receiving an Operating Budget
Authorization Document (OBAD).
   7.3.1. Load annual and quarterly obligation authority targets to current fiscal year (CFY) or
   current operating budget year (COBY) as indicated on the OBAD.
   7.3.2. FMA Offices establish certification and reprogramming levels. These levels are BA,
   PE, EEIC, or imposed limitation (floors, ceilings and fences).
   7.3.3. The ledgers show budget authorities on a cumulative basis and compare them with
   actual obligations to determine the amount available for obligation by fiscal year (FY).
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                        29


                                           Chapter 8

ADMINISTERING, EXPENSING AND REPORTING MILITARY PERSONNEL COSTS

8.1. Managing Military Personnel Expense Authority. The Air Force uses centrally managed
allotment (CMA) procedures to manage the military personnel appropriation. Responsibilities:
   8.1.1. SAF/FMBOP. Authorizes funding for military personnel to support Air Force
   missions. SAF/FMBOP doesn't distribute funding to any lower level of command, but
   permits disbursing officers throughout the Air Force to make authorized payments against the
   CMA. Use this authority to incur authorized expenses for assigned military personnel.
       8.1.1.1. Serves as focal point for administration of financial expense authority associated
       with military personnel programs.
       8.1.1.2. Manages the CMA.
       8.1.1.3. Coordinates military personnel information with personnel and financial
       management activities at HQ USAF and with other DoD components.
       8.1.1.4. Ensures consistency of funding allocations with planned military personnel
       programs.
       8.1.1.5. Verifies the reliability of reported expense for military personnel by analyzing
       rate variance between expenses at standard rates and actual entitlements.
       8.1.1.6. Monitors differences between budgeted and actual expense authority for military
       personnel, and recommends corrective actions to the Personnel Budget Review
       Committee (PBRC), if required.
   8.1.2. Base-Level Comptroller and Force Support Squadrons. Initiate authorizations to
   pay entitlements based on the military member's validated status.
   8.1.3. DFAS-IN and Air Force Financial Services Center. Pay the member's entitlements
   based on their validated status and statutory entitlements. Note: Pay and allowances are
   statutory entitlements automatically incurred until the member separates.
8.2. Using Standard Rates for Military Personnel:
   8.2.1. Use standard rates to compute and record military personnel costs.
8.3. Controlling Other Military Personnel Expenses. SAF/FMBOP centrally controls
expense authority for PCS movements, subsistence and other miscellaneous personnel costs, and
the reimbursement program.
   8.3.1. PCS Expenses. Base the PCS travel and transportation program on Air Staff-
   approved programs, policies and actions that result in military PCSs. Duties:
       8.3.1.1. SAF/FMBOP maintains fund control by establishing administrative limitations
       with AF/A1PP and Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) on the number of PCS moves by
       type of move -- accession, training, separation, operational, rotational and unit moves.
       8.3.1.2. AFPC directs most PCS travel assignment actions.
 30                                                               AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


      8.3.1.3. AFPC controls the number of MAJCOM-directed intra-command PCSs by
      establishing move quotas allocated by specific numbers and types.
      8.3.1.4. When PCS orders are authenticated, all authorized expenses shall be recorded to
      the current year in which the orders are issued. (Reference AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
      Paragraph 12.5.16)
   8.3.2. Subsistence and Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). As authorized by base-level,
   DFAS-IN pays basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) and BAH centrally through the Air
   Force’s military pay system. HQ AF Services Agency (AFSVA) provides monthly
   subsistence-in-kind (SIK) contractual costs to SAF/FMBOP for obligation purposes.
   8.3.3. Reimbursement Authority:
      8.3.3.1. SAF/FMBOP obtains reimbursement program authority to cover anticipated
      earnings from:
          8.3.3.1.1. Other government agencies (for military personnel assigned on a full-time
          basis for the benefit of those agencies).
          8.3.3.1.2. The foreign military sales (FMS) program.
          8.3.3.1.3. Non-DoD federal agencies and nonfederal organizations to whom the Air
          Force provides military personnel services.
          8.3.3.1.4. DWCF activities (OUSD Comptroller provides rates).
      8.3.3.2. DFAS-IN develops, consolidates and reports reimbursable expenses (earnings),
      based on field site reported data and the RCS: HAF-ACF (M) 7184 (DT) report IAW
      DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, Chapter 29.
8.4. Administering and Reporting Military Personnel Expense Authority. SAF/FMBOP,
DFAS-IN are mainly responsible for administering and monitoring military personnel
appropriation expenses.
8.5. Description of Costs Covered by Military Personnel Appropriation.
   8.5.1. Use the military personnel appropriation (3500) for pay, allowances and other costs
   for officers, enlisted and cadets on active duty. The appropriation consists of six primary
   financial programs, each with several projects. It does not include personnel costs of the Air
   Force Reserve and Air National Guard unless they are mobilized to active duty under Title
   10. Record costs IAW AFMAN 65-604.
      8.5.1.1. Budget Activity 01. Officer pay and allowances are recorded under P51* and
      P52* shreds. Pay and allowances include base pay, retired pay accrual, basic allowance
      for housing, social security tax, specials pays, basic allowance for subsistence and other
      pays as authorized by law.
      8.5.1.2. Budget Activity 02. Enlisted pay and allowances (except those costs accounted
      for in Budget Activity 04) are recorded under P53* and P54*shreds. Pay and allowances
      include base pay, retired pay accrual, basic allowance for housing, social security tax,
      special pays and other pays as authorized by law.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                       31


       8.5.1.3. Budget Activity 03. US Air Force Academy cadets pay and allowances are
       recorded under P55*. Pay and allowances include base pay, subsistence and social
       security taxes.
       8.5.1.4. Budget Activity 04. Subsistence of enlisted personnel is recorded under P56*.
       Subsistence includes BAS, family subsistence supplemental allowance and subsistence-
       in-kind.
       8.5.1.5. Budget Activity 05. PCS travel, per diem and other moving expenses are
       recorded under P57**** and P58****. PCS travel includes accession, training,
       operational, rotational, separation, organized unit, emergency evacuation, special and
       other moves as detailed in AFMAN 65-604.
       8.5.1.6. Budget Activity 06. Other Military Personnel Costs are recorded under P59*.
       These costs include apprehension of Air Force deserters, absentees, and military
       prisoners; interest on uniformed services savings deposit program; death gratuities;
       unemployment compensation; survivor benefits; extra hazard reimbursement for service
       members’ group life insurance; education benefits (Montgomery GI Bill); adoption
       expenses; senior reserve officers training corps (ROTC) and junior ROTC.
       8.5.1.7. Air Reserve Component personnel brought on active duty to fulfill active duty
       Air Force requirements will receive normal pay, allowances, special pays and
       entitlements paid by the 57*3500 appropriation. Charge travel and per diem costs to the
       O&M-type funds of the Air Force organization being supported. See AFI 65-601,
       Volume 1, Paragraph 12.9 for details.
8.6. Cost of Contingency Operations. The Air Force pay and accounting system does not have
the capability to capture and report military personnel costs associated with specific
contingencies (i.e., ESP code). In instances where contingency cost reporting is required,
AF/A1MS will provide man-day data from the Command Man-Day Allocation System (CMAS)
to SAF/FMBOP. SAF/FMBOP will apply current standard rates to compute Air Reserve
Component (ARC) 57*3500 contingency costs. When available, SAF/FMBOP will use actual
expense data for incremental active duty costs associated with contingency operations. In lieu of
this data, SAF/FMBOP will use standard rates to project and expense incremental active duty
personnel costs.

                 CIVILIAN MANPOWER REPORTING AND FUNDING

9.1. Overview. This chapter applies to organizations that pay Air Force civilian employees
from these appropriations and funds: (See Attachment 6 for additional details.)
   9.1.1. Operation and Maintenance, Air Force.
   9.1.2. Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force.
   9.1.3. Defense Working Capital Fund.
   9.1.4. Operation and Maintenance, Air Force Reserve.
   9.1.5. Operation and Maintenance, Air National Guard.
9.2. Management of Civilian Resources. The responsibility for civilian resource management
is assigned through the Air Force chain of command from the Secretary of the Air Force to
MAJCOM commanders, to subordinate commanders and down to first-level supervisors.
MAJCOMs, field-operating agencies, direct reporting units, installation commanders, tenant
commanders, and heads of activities will establish a corporate board to ensure that civilian
resources are used most efficiently and effectively. Usually, the corporate board is co-chaired by
FM and A1 and includes staff representatives from civilian personnel, financial management and
manpower functional areas.
   9.2.1. Purpose of the civilian personnel corporate board.
       9.2.1.1. Meet at least quarterly or more regularly as needed to review the organization’s
       civilian personnel operating budget, on-board strength and workyear execution.
       9.2.1.2. Review the Civilian Employment Plan (CEP) to monitor the organizational
       employment levels. The ultimate goal in civilian employment planning is to maintain a
       100% fill rate within budget constraints. Congressional scrutiny of under executed
       workyears results in loss of funding and ultimately loss of authorizations.
       9.2.1.3. Analyze the impact of civilian pay expenditures against budgetary targets and
       workyear execution and develop strategies to fully execute the civilian personnel
       program.
       9.2.1.4. Establish policies associated with funding overhires, use of a summer hire
       program, the annual awards associated with performance appraisals, overtime use, other
       cash awards, etc.
9.3. Responsibilities:

                                          Chapter 10

                      RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RMS)

10.1. Overview. This chapter shows how to start and maintain a resource management system
(RMS) for the O&M Appropriation. The procedures apply mainly to base-level operations but
may also apply to other operating locations.
   10.1.1. The term "resource management system" doesn't refer to a single separate program.
   The Air Force's RMS:
       10.1.1.1. Involves various systems focusing on outputs and resources used, on managers
       effectively using resources, on measuring actual performance compared to planned
       performance and on using execution plans and accounting to enhance management
       control at each organizational level.
       10.1.1.2. The program is based on the DoD planning, programming and budgeting and
       execution (PPBE).
       10.1.1.3. The RMS provides a way to establish priorities, choose policies and act to get
       the desired results and required resources at an acceptable cost, in accordance with
       applicable regulations.
   10.1.2. RMS elements include the execution plan, management and accounting systems,
   participatory and committee management, resource management teams and resource
   management training.
10.2. RMS Duties. Air Force managers oversee activities that cost money. Oversight involves
more than legal accountability. HQ USAF and MAJCOMs make many decisions about using
resources (e.g., flying hour allocations and manpower authorizations). Although base-level
resource managers don't control initial allocation of all their resources, they must effectively
manage these resources.
   10.2.1. Commanders. Financial management is inherent to command. Commanders:
       10.2.1.1. Review, validate and balance the execution plan to ensure successful financial
       management.
       10.2.1.2. Actively review financial programs for each of the responsibility centers
       reporting directly to them.
       10.2.1.3. Improve resource management by inquiring about program conditions,
       reviewing causes, weighing alternatives and directing action.
       10.2.1.4. Ensure RMS success by allocating sufficient resources to RMS training and
       Resource Management Team efforts.
   10.2.2. Comptrollers. The comptroller supports the organization's mission and the Air
   Force by providing sound financial management and unbiased decision support to the
   commander and staff. The comptroller:
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      39


     10.2.2.1. Promotes responsible and proper financial management throughout the
     organization to ensure the economical and efficient use of resources consistent with
     statutory and regulatory requirements.
     10.2.2.2. Applies policies and procedures enabling the organization to carry out
     accounting, budget and cost functions.
     10.2.2.3. Is the chief personnel manager of the comptroller organization and, at base-
     level, is usually the commander of a comptroller squadron and wing staff agencies.
  10.2.3. Responsibility Center Managers (RCM). The RCM plans, directs and coordinates
  subordinate organizations' activities (e.g., group or squadron commander). The RCM:
     10.2.3.1. Reviews resource requirements of subordinate units.
     10.2.3.2. Integrates requirements into an RC operating budget.
     10.2.3.3. Justifies requirements before the commander's review authorities.
     10.2.3.4. Determines the proper distribution of the approved RC execution plan.
     10.2.3.5. Analyzes subordinate organizations' plans and performance at least monthly.
     Identifies imbalances in resource distribution and their causes and makes sure that
     resource consumption contributes effectively to mission accomplishment. Analyzes
     alternative actions and balances programs.
     10.2.3.6. Understands and complies with Interim Guidance on Procedures for
     Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the Department
     of the Air Force.
     10.2.3.7. Appoints resource advisors and provides FMA with the most current
     appointment letter.
        10.2.3.7.1. RA selection is important. Consider these qualities in selecting an RA.
        The RA should have:
            10.2.3.7.1.1. A working knowledge of the organization's mission, the mix of
            resources required to do the mission and the historical cost record.
            10.2.3.7.1.2. A knowledge of the accounting system for operations, the
            procurement system and the supply system, with particular concentration on data
            entry, flows and reports produced.
            10.2.3.7.1.3. An ability to distinguish between apparent and real causes.
            10.2.3.7.1.4. An ability to deal successfully with personnel in subordinate, lateral
            and higher level organizations.
            10.2.3.7.1.5. A questioning nature with mature judgment, usually resulting from
            experience.
            10.2.3.7.1.6. Sufficient time to do all necessary resource management
            requirements for their unit. Preferably, RAs should be able to fulfill their
            resource management duties for at least one year.
  10.2.4. Cost Center Managers (CCM). The cost center is the basic production
  organization (e.g., flights). The CCM regulates the consumption of workhours, supplies,
 40                                                                  AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


   equipment and services in producing things and doing tasks. CCMs shift resources to or
   from the various production tasks within the CC to ensure the proper mix or to provide the
   emphasis required. The CCM:
       10.2.4.1. Starts building the execution plan.
       10.2.4.2. Determines the validity of the execution plan as a whole and develops resource
       requirements and narrative justifications.
       10.2.4.3. Fosters daily awareness of the relationship between resources used and
       products produced and realigns resources as approved by superiors.
   10.2.5. Resource Advisors (RA). RCMs appoint RAs. A CC manager may also appoint an
   RA if the size of the CC warrants (e.g., staff agency’s). RAs:
       10.2.5.1. Monitor and help prepare estimates for resources.
       10.2.5.2. Help develop obligation and expense targets.
       10.2.5.3. Monitor the use of resources in daily operations.
       10.2.5.4. Provide RMS training to CCMs.
       10.2.5.5. Represent the RCM in the Financial Working Group.
       10.2.5.6. Assist the comptroller during fiscal year-end closeout.
       10.2.5.7. Serve as the primary point of contact with comptroller personnel and other RAs
       on resource management matters pertaining to their responsibility center.
       10.2.5.8. Know the details of the organization's cost, program and fiscal requirements;
       understand the relationship between output and cost.
       10.2.5.9. Understand the use of management reports produced by the accounting system
       for operations and the materiel management system.
       10.2.5.10. Interpret these management reports and recommend necessary management
       actions to the RC or CC manager.
10.3. Participatory Financial Management. A corporate organizational approach which
combines efforts of the commander and supporting staff is the most effective, efficient way to set
priorities or to reduce, defer or eliminate programs. To provide collective resource management
action, each base-level organization must establish and maintain a financial management
structure, consisting of a Financial Management Board (FMB) and a Financial Working Group
(FWG). Small organizations, where the FMB and FWG composition would essentially be the
same, may form a single committee. Note: MAJCOMs may require approval before combining
the FWG and FMB; see Paragraph 2.12.
   10.3.1. The Financial Management Board. The senior or host commander at each base,
   field operating agency or direct reporting unit establishes the FMB. The FMB determines
   program priorities and ensures effective allocation of resources.
       10.3.1.1. Top level managers, with membership tailored to the type of organization
       structure involved, comprise the FMB. The list below shows the composition of a typical
       wing or base FMB. The FMB chairperson may choose additional or reduced voting, as
       well as, advisory non-voting membership.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      41


Table 10.1. Sample FMB Membership List.

Operations Group Commander            Member
Maintenance Group Commander           Member
Mission Support Group Commander       Member
Medical Group Commander               Member
Comptroller                           Advisor
FMA Officer                           Recorder
      10.3.1.2. The chairperson convenes the FMB at least quarterly. The recorder prepares
      minutes of meetings, files the original in the FMA office and provides copies to FMB and
      FWG members. Note: Minutes only need to be available for review for one prior year
      and the current fiscal year.
      10.3.1.3. RCMs, directly subordinate to FMB members, attend meetings as technical
      advisers when appropriate. They provide impact data during deliberation on FMBs
      recommendations.
      10.3.1.4. The FMB reviews, approves or disapproves recommendations made by the
      FWG to ensure balanced valid financial programs and to consider all known or
      anticipated program requirements. The FMB must review, revise as necessary, and
      approve all appropriated fund execution plans.
          10.3.1.4.1. The FMBs composition places the base-level financial management
          emphasis on line managers who head major RCs directly related to the
          accomplishment of the base mission. FMB decisions cover the base's overall
          programs.
          10.3.1.4.2. These decisions evolve from reviewing, evaluating and approving the
          execution plans or revisions. FMB recommends distribution of execution plan targets
          to base organizations and identifies unfunded requirements and other actions affecting
          the financial operations of the base.
      10.3.1.5. The FMB members:
          10.3.1.5.1. Review requirements for approved programs and activities to ensure
          balanced financial support throughout.
          10.3.1.5.2. Review and approve the distribution of annual obligation targets. You
          can delegate this authority to another body; e.g., FWG. The FWG reviews and
          approves programs for deferring, reducing, eliminating or moving to the execution
          plans unfunded portion.
          10.3.1.5.3. Evaluate and list in priority sequence all unfunded requirements.
          10.3.1.5.4. Review and approve investment equipment (57*3080 Appropriation)
          items for purchase (unless they delegated this authority to a separate committee).
   10.3.2. The Financial Working Group. Both line and staff RA and RCMs serve as FWG
   members. The FWG manages commodities and resources integral to the operating activities
   of the base or unit. RAs/RCMs on the FWG participate in developing all-inclusive budgets
 42                                                              AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


   and execution plans for organizations/programs and monitor the daily use of resources in
   their RCs.
      10.3.2.1. RAs or RCMs from the functions listed below compose the typical FWG
      membership. Any additional or reduced voting and advisory non-voting is at the
      chairperson’s discretion, based on local management requirements.

Table 10.2. Sample FWG Membership List.
Staff                        Position
FMA Officer                  Chairperson
Operations Group RA          Member
Maintenance Group RA         Member
Mission Support Group RA     Member
Medical Group RA             Member
Civil Engineering            Advisor
Contracting                  Advisor
      10.3.2.2. Convene FWG meetings as necessary, to support the FMB. Hold meetings at
      least once a quarter for effective financial management. The chairperson (or recorder)
      prepares minutes of meetings, files the original in the FMA office and provides copies to
      FWG members. Note: Minutes only need to be available for review for one prior year
      and the current fiscal year.
      10.3.2.3. The FWG develops requirements and revisions for the base or unit execution
      plan.    The FWG reviews all appropriated fund execution plans and makes
      recommendations to the FMB for final approval. FWG members:
          10.3.2.3.1. Integrate support requirements from organization’s prioritized list of
          financial requirements with a balanced mission program.
          10.3.2.3.2. Analyze the FWG's execution plan thoroughly and impartially to achieve
          high credibility.
          10.3.2.3.3. Act as the commanders agents, as well as the parent activities
          representatives during the review.
      10.3.2.4. The FWG identifies unfunded requirements, recommends priorities and
      presents them to the FMB for approval.
      10.3.2.5. The FWG recommends for FMB approval adjustments of execution plan
      targets between RCs to correct imbalances in resources distribution imbalances.
      10.3.2.6. The FWG members:
          10.3.2.6.1. Help develop requirements for base operating budgets and other
          appropriated funds.
          10.3.2.6.2. Represent their organizations on matters concerning distributing quarterly
          and annual operating budget authority to the RC level.
          10.3.2.6.3. Offer technical guidance to base activities on using their primary
          responsibility resources.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      43


          10.3.2.6.4. Monitor execution plan execution by reviewing obligation data to ensure
          quarterly and annual programs are valid and adequate.
          10.3.2.6.5. Recommend reprogramming or other management action to the FMB
          when needed.
10.4. Administering the Operating Budget and Execution Plan. Base-level managers must
play an active role in preparing and administering their portion of the budget. There are many
unique requirements, budgeting methods, cost factors and other variable elements involved in
preparing budget and execution plans. Each base or unit must involve operating managers in
execution plan formulation, justification, review and execution.
   10.4.1. Distributing the Approved Operating Budget Authority. Upon receiving the
   OBA from higher headquarters, the FWG and FMB distribute the funded amounts to RC
   managers.
       10.4.1.1. After analyzing the OBA, the FWG submits proposed targets to the FMB for
       each RC receiving funding.
       10.4.1.2. The execution plan lists amounts by PE, EEIC and ESP (if applicable); data can
       be summarized at different levels of detail depending on the audience.
       10.4.1.3. The RC considers EEIC amounts as targets and distributes the OBA in this
       manner, (unless higher headquarters placed specific limitations on any EEIC amount).
       RCMs usually don't impose additional restraints other than those on the base's OBA.
   10.4.2. Establishing and Maintaining Targets. Targets translate mission requirements into
   the dollar value required to do that mission. See Chapter 5 and Interim Guidance on
   Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the
   Department of the Air Force for targets, limitations and processing targets.
       10.4.2.1. Targets' purposes are to:
          10.4.2.1.1. Serve as guides for consuming resources, stated in the dollar value terms
          of the targets established.
          10.4.2.1.2. Provide the measure to determine planning effectiveness.
          10.4.2.1.3. Provide the control mechanism to meet alternatives specified in execution
          plans.
          10.4.2.1.4. Establish the process of periodic reviews to identify resource overages
          and shortages. This permits resource redistribution to greatest need areas.
       10.4.2.2. Targets apply at:
          10.4.2.2.1. Management decision levels selected by the command or base.
          10.4.2.2.2. The level that has the most significant impact on resource consumption --
          usually the second or third RC levels.
       10.4.2.3. Established targets (base-wide and at the major RC level) usually remain stable
       for at least one quarter, unless modified by mission changes. View EEIC amounts in
       their proper perspective (within a program element at command level and within RC
       targets at base level).
44                                                                AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


        10.4.2.3.1. EEIC amounts are execution planning guides. They aren't statutory or
        administrative limitations on obligations. Don't use amounts as mandatory goals, but
        they may be subject to limitations, such as ceilings, floors, fences, etc.
        10.4.2.3.2. Don't chase obligations with associated targets -- that is, don't increase a
        target solely to prevent exceeding that target.
     10.4.2.4. RCMs principal financial concerns:
        10.4.2.4.1. Ensure actual obligations are in line with their quarterly and annual
        operating budget authority totals.
        10.4.2.4.2. Examine validity of obligations to determine if appropriate for output
        production and mission accomplishment.
     10.4.2.5. Base financial analysts (comptroller personnel) principal concern is ensuring
     basewide obligations don't exceed the annual total of the base's operating budget and
     legal or administrative limitations on the base OBAD or FAD.
        10.4.2.5.1. Financial analysts monitor the actual expenses and obligations of each RC
        versus their execution plan totals.
        10.4.2.5.2. Financial analysts normally do not control each RCMs obligations by
        EEIC. Unless there are mission or OBA changes, financial committees shouldn't
        adjust RC operating budget authority targets more frequently than quarterly.
     10.4.2.6. Time targets:
        10.4.2.6.1. Use annual targets as long-range planning guides and the total available
        funds for the fiscal year. Make sure managers create proper plans to obligate
        available funds and don't exceed targets without prior approval from the FMA office.
        10.4.2.6.2. The quarterly obligation authority represents the funds available for
        cumulative gross commitments. Quarterly obligation authority is cumulative from
        the beginning of the fiscal year.
  10.4.3. Reprogramming Authority. There are two significant                   levels     of   base
  reprogramming authority or flexibility between RCs and within RCs.
     10.4.3.1. Within a BA, the commander may designate a reprogramming threshold below
     which there is no need to convene the FMB for approval if the involved RCs agree.
        10.4.3.1.1. FMA officers may reprogram quarterly operating budget authority
        without prior FMB approval if:
            10.4.3.1.1.1. They act during the first three quarters of each fiscal year.
            10.4.3.1.1.2. Involved RCMs approve it.
            10.4.3.1.1.3. Reprogramming actions are reviewed at the next FWG/FMB
            meetings. The FMB must approve such a policy during the first meeting of each
            fiscal year.
        10.4.3.1.2. Financial management analysis officers may approve routine transfers of
        quarterly operating budget authority to and from higher headquarters. Review
        transfers at the next FWG/FMB meetings.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      45


       10.4.3.2. An RCM may have full authority to make EEIC adjustments internal to the
       budget totals, including redistribution of subordinate cost center amounts provided it is
       within the limitations stated on the operating budget authority documents. In some
       instances, major command or local management impose administrative restrictions to this
       reprogramming flexibility, but usually limit restrictions to specific funding areas. The
       RCM:
          10.4.3.2.1. Must coordinate with FMA before changing the quarterly or annual target
          amounts.
          10.4.3.2.2. May determine the EEIC mix and CC distribution best suited to
          accomplish their mission unless FMB approves restrictions to the contrary.
10.5. Using Productivity and Related Programs. The ability to reprogram and retain
resources motivates innovative managers to save through improved management practices.
When managers save money through their own initiative (by economizing or doing a job more
efficiently) then, if possible, make these savings available for the organization's unfunded
requirements. This gives an incentive for every manager to save funds while completing their
mission.
   10.5.1. Retaining and reprogramming funds isn't always possible because the Air Force's
   overall mission comes first. Overriding requirements may dictate using resources saved for
   purposes outside the jurisdiction of the manager, base, or command producing the savings.
   We want to create a financial and management environment that encourages and rewards
   improved efficiency.
   10.5.2. Formal and informal programs provide managers chances to get financial help for
   carrying out cost-saving ideas. Informal programs usually include items that don't fit
   established criteria and result mainly in cost avoidances or operation efficiencies.
   Established formal Air Force programs include:
       10.5.2.1. Productivity Investment Funding (PIF). See AFI 38-301, Productivity
       Enhancing Capital Investment Program.
       10.5.2.2. Fast Payback Capital Investment Program (FASCAP). See AFI 38-301.
       10.5.2.3. Value Engineering (VE). See AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life
       Cycle Management.
       10.5.2.4. Innovative Development Through Employee Awareness (IDEA)
       Program. See AFI 38-401, The Air Force Innovative Development Through Employee
       Awareness (Idea) Program.
       10.5.2.5. Management Engineering Program (MEP). See AFMAN 38-208, Volumes
       1, Air Force Management Engineering Program (MEP) - Processes.
       10.5.2.6. Energy Management. See AFPD 90-17, Energy Management and AFI 90-
       1701, Energy Management
       10.5.2.7. Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment Program (PECI). See AFI 38-
       301.
   10.5.3. Air Force Audit Agency's (AFAA) Statement of Potential Monetary
   Benefits. Audit reports include potential monetary benefits data.
46                                                           AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


     10.5.3.1. Management may concur or non-concur with the auditor's estimate of monetary
     benefits identified in each audit report. The AFAA reports this data to higher
     headquarters through the RCS: DD-IG(SA) 1574 report.
     10.5.3.2. Use potential monetary benefits to identify ways to use resources more
     effectively. The FMA officer must be aware of these potential monetary savings because
     the reports often lead to budget adjustments. See AFI 65-403.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                    47

              RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RMS) TRAINING

11.1. General Information. This chapter outlines the responsibilities of persons and
organizations involved in base-level RMS training. The guidance covers training frequency,
program administration, basic content and the target group.
   11.1.1. Each Air Force manager must manage his resources efficiently. To fulfill this duty,
   all managers require accurate and timely information designed to their needs. For example,
   managers require information to develop execution plan requirements and to monitor actual
   expenses and obligations against established targets.
   11.1.2. A system or program must provide this information and procedures to each
   organizational level.
11.2. Initial RMS Training:
   11.2.1. Initial training must offer an overview of basic Air Force financial management
   policies and an understanding of local unique programs and procedures. Newly assigned
   RCMs, CCMs, and RAs must be familiar with their duties and responsibilities. The initial
   training provides:
      11.2.1.1. A financial processes overview.
      11.2.1.2. An understanding of their responsibilities to their organization and the
      Comptroller.
      11.2.1.3. A knowledge of available management reports.
      11.2.1.4. An understanding of the functions and key resource manager’s assigned duties.
      11.2.1.5. An overview of procurement and supply procedures.
   11.2.2. Provide new RCMs with initial RMS training not later than 90 days after assignment
   of financial management responsibility.
      11.2.2.1. Start RAs initial training within 30 days after assignment and complete it
      within 90 days after assignment.
      11.2.2.2. The comptroller or designee must give initial RMS training to all RCMs (e.g.,
      group or squadron commanders) and their respective RAs.
      11.2.2.3. RAs possessing an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) of 6F0X* or 65F* or the
      equivalent financial management civilian series code (e.g., 0501, 0560, etc.) are not
      required to do initial RMS training. Resource advisors who do not have FM specific
      AFSCs or equivalent financial management civilian series codes (e.g., 0501, 0560, etc.)
      require initial RMS training.
   11.2.3. RAs train CCMs with assistance from the comptroller personnel.
      11.2.3.1. MAJCOM and base-level management should control the content and
      presentation method of RMS training so it can cover areas unique to the command and
      base.
48                                                               AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


  11.2.4. The following includes a minimum list of subjects comptrollers will use in their
  initial RMS training with RCMs and RAs:
     11.2.4.1. RMS functions and responsibilities of:
         11.2.4.1.1. Center, Wing, or Base commander.

     11.2.4.4. Formulation of the execution plan.
     11.2.4.5. Execution of the execution plan:
         11.2.4.5.1. Operating Budget Authority (OBA).
         11.2.4.5.2. Annual and quarterly targets.
         11.2.4.5.3. Legal and administrative limitations.
         11.2.4.5.4. Disposition of savings.
         11.2.4.5.5. Year-end closeout procedures.
         11.2.4.5.6. Unfunded requirements.
         11.2.4.5.7. Flexibility within the OBA.
         11.2.4.5.8. Reimbursements and refunds.

         11.2.4.5.19. Travel obligations to include orders, advances, debts and accruals.
         11.2.4.5.20. MAJCOM Comptrollers ensure Financial Managers include MORD
         guidance.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                     49


     11.2.4.6. FM Systems Access and Training Prerequisites. (Reference SAF/FM Policy
     Letter, 30 April 2009).
         11.2.4.6.1. Examples of financial management systems include, but are not limited
         to: general accounting and finance system-base level (GAFS-BL), defense enterprise
         accounting and management system (DEAMS), automated business services system
         (ABSS), automated funds management (AFM), FMSuite and FMSuite ODA,
         commander’s resource integration system (CRIS), and wide area workflow (WAWF).
         Defense travel system (DTS) is not included in this policy.
         11.2.4.6.2. Individuals must complete and maintain currency in one of the five
         training options prior to receiving access to FM systems: In-residence AFSC
         awarding courses (3-level or Basic Financial Management Officer Course
         (BFMOC)), Online Enlisted Journeyman Course, Financial Management Staff Officer
         Course (FMSOC), Officer, Basic or Advanced Comptroller Contingency
         Familiarization Course or FM Body of Knowledge Basic Course. Currency expires
         after five years from date of completion.
  11.2.5. There are many resources available to assist in conducting RMS training.
  Incorporating the following material will expand and enhance the trainees' comprehension of
  the RMS.
     11.2.5.1. FM Online: https://fmonline.ousdc.osd.mil/
         11.2.5.1.1. FM Online provides current information and articles on topics of interest
         for the FM community.
         11.2.5.1.2. Access FM myLearn through FM Online for a comprehensive e-catalog
         of FM training (e.g., Fiscal Law) and professional development.
     11.2.5.2. FM Distributed Learning Center: https://fm.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp
         11.2.5.2.1. Includes a comprehensive catalog of FM training (e.g., Financial
         Management Body of Knowledge (can be used for FM systems access)).
         11.2.5.2.2. Have newly appointed resource advisors take each of the Financial
         Management Principles (Basic) online courses, as well as, Financial Management
         Concepts online courses (under Budget Formulation and Execution) as part of their
         initial training.
     11.2.5.3. AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 2, Part 13 - Standard Base
     Supply Customer’s Procedures.
  11.2.6. There is no single method to do RMS training.       Use a mix of methods. The
  following is a list of proven methods:
     11.2.6.1. Financial Management Committee Presentation. Suited to establish, review
     and discuss policies and procedures. Devote small segments of the committee meetings
     to clarify or review specialized subjects.
     11.2.6.2. Classroom and Group Presentation. Best suited for initial RMS training.
     Prepare training packages requiring little revision for slide or video presentation.
 50                                                                    AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


       11.2.6.3. Individual One-on-One Sessions. Use this to train new financial managers
       and to address specific individual needs. This method is the most flexible.
       11.2.6.4. Written Material. Use written training aids, pamphlets, handouts, DLS
       courses, checklists, newsletters and budget policy letters for RMS training.
11.3. Continuation and Refresher Training:
   11.3.1. Comptrollers will provide RAs with refresher training, after satisfactory completion
   of initial basic and specialized training. Design training for specific persons or small groups
   such as the FWG.
       11.3.1.1. Provide personnel training for maintaining proficiency and keeping abreast of
       current management policies on effective use of resources.
       11.3.1.2. Frequently hold continuation and refresher training, tailored to local needs, to
       keep resource management personnel current on budget and accounting policies,
       procedures and instructions.
   11.3.2. RAs provide continuation and refresher training of CCMs.
       11.3.2.1. The RA may request comptroller help in the refresher training of CC managers.
   11.3.3. The required training, the number of people, and training environment determines if
   the continuation and refresher training is formal (training sessions or FWG meetings).
   Informal training is casual (training through one-on-one contact or during visits to
   Responsibility Centers by the unit resource management team).
11.4. Administration of the RMS Training Program:
   11.4.1. Comptrollers must properly document initial RMS training to ensure complete
   coverage of necessary information for all personnel requiring training, while preventing
   unnecessary duplication.
       11.4.1.1. FMA offices will maintain initial training documentation for RC managers and
       RAs, as well as maintain training certificates for all FM system access users outlined in
       Paragraphs 11.2.4.6 to 11.2.4.6.2. Keep all training documentation on hand for one prior
       fiscal year and the current fiscal year, but keep FM system access training certificates on-
       hand for five years or until the FM system user has updated their training requirement.
       11.4.1.2. The RA's organizations keep CC managers training documentation.
       11.4.1.3. Keep training documentation current. Record initial training and FM system
       access training by using the format in Table 11.1. Use automated or manual record
       keeping systems.

Table 11.1. RMS Training Documentation Format.

AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      57


Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms and AFDD 1-2, Air Force
Glossary contain standardized terms and definition for Department of Defense and Air Force use.
Automated Supply and Equipment Systems—The General Support, Systems Support, and
Medical—Dental, Reparable Support divisions of the Defense Working Capital Fund provide
data for processing periodically during the month and at month end into the general accounting
system. Periodic processing between systems provides current supply and equipment expense
data to DFAS-Defense Accounting Office and updates the status of funds for base-level resource
managers and Budget. Accounting system management reports and automated materiel system
reports provide the RCM and CCMs with the information necessary to monitor their execution
plan execution.
Civilian Payroll System—Provides biweekly expense and disbursement data output from this
system to interface with the accounting system. Civilian payroll transactions affect either
accrued expense unpaid (AEU) or accrued expense paid (AEP). The ensuing pay cycle
accumulates expense data and establishes necessary accruals. Output is the RCS: DD-COMP
(AR) 1092 report. (See Chapter 9 and DFAS-DE 7077.2-M on support system.)
DoD Functional Categories—These 16 categories are a method of arranging data in the
conventional budget structure or the FYDP. Functional category descriptions are in DFAS-DE
Regulations.
Element of Expense and Investment Code (EEIC)—These represent the final breakout in the
budget structure. The number varies with the major command (MAJCOM), depending on the
number of sub-elements required for local management. This part of the budget structure is quite
similar to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) object classification. Air Force EEICs
and DoD elements of expense are in the Financial Management Data Dictionary.
Interim Work Information Management System (IWIMS)—The general accounting and
finance system and IWIMS are independent systems that exchange data. IWIMS receives daily
accounting transactions affecting civil engineering. IWIMS, in turn, passes data back to the
general accounting and finance system at the end of each month for civil engineering material
cost distribution data.     Additionally, the IWIMS produces a monthly Schedule of
Reimbursements and Refunds Report that reflects reimbursable and refund costs applicable to
each BCE reimbursable/refundable customer. This data is used by DFAS to record
reimbursements or refunds to the proper accounts. DFAS requires special coding to identify
obligation and expense transactions entered into the accounting system that also apply to Civil
Engineering/IWIMS. See DFAS-DE 7077.2-M, Section 53 for more detailed information on
IWIMS processing.
Material Management Reports—There are many reports produced by the expeditionary
combat support system that provide budget personnel and resource managers detailed
information on the operating budget authority set aside for purchases from the Defense Working
Capital Fund. Most often used are the RC/CC Summary List, Project Fund Management
Report, PFMR/ OCCR Update and Reconciliation Report, Consolidated Fund Management
Report and Obligated Due-Out Listing.
Military Personnel Expense System—This system records the expenses of military personnel
at standard rates by program element and element of expense. Use assigned strength as of the
 58                                                                 AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


first calendar day of each month as the basis to compute military personnel expense for that
month. (See Chapter 8 and DFAS-DE 7077.2-M for information on this system.)
Online Vehicle Interactive Management System (OLVIMS)—A system to improve
management effectiveness in base motor vehicle maintenance and operation and to interface with
portions of the standard accounting and finance and base supply systems. The general
accounting and finance system and OLVIMS exchange information daily between themselves.
The accounting system extracts vehicle maintenance and operation costs and passes these costs
to OLVIMS to make cost distribution and identify reimbursements and refunds. See DFAS-DE
7077.2M, Section 54 for more detailed information on OLVIMS processing.
Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR) System—The OCCR system provides for current
day as well as fiscal year-to-date materiel obligation and expense data recorded at the cost center
level for EEICs 600, 602, 609, 628, 644 and 645. The system provides cost center level
management products showing the net value (issues less turn-ins) of materiel issued by EEIC,
value of obligated due-outs by EEIC and fund availability targets by EEIC.
Project Funds Management Record (PFMR)/Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR)
Directory—This program provides a directory of PFMR and OCCR indicative data for use by
FMA, supply, RCMs, RAs, CCMs and all other financial management personnel in identifying
coded financial data to the applicable organization(s).
Program Element (PE)—PEs describe all forces, activities and support required to accomplish
the Air Force mission with associated costs.
Project Funds Management Record (PFMR) System—A system to provide monitorship and
control over each RCM's execution plan programmed for purchase of expensed materiel by
CCMs from the General Support Division, and Reparable Support Division of the Defense
Working Capital Fund. The expeditionary combat support system provides management
products informing each responsibility center manager and Budget of the status of operating
budget authority fund availability, as well as fiscal year-to-date data concerning expensed
materiel buys and on-order (due-outs) by current and prior year. The PFMR is a control record
for one or more organization cost center records (OCCRs). The OCCR to PFMR system is a
relationship similar to the relationship between the cost center and responsibility center.
Standard Material Accounting System—A variety of reports produced for the medical
function provide valuable financial data for the budget function. The system accumulates and
provides financial data for all base and tenant medical dental stock-funded and non-stock-funded
supplies and equipment. This data mainly concerns financial transactions within fund code 2X
but, transactions occur frequently within other BAs and involve mainly buys with EEIC 604 and
624.
Total Actual Authority (TAA)—TAA is TOA, or direct authority plus reimbursements earned
(filled plus unfilled customer orders), whichever is less.
Total Obligation Authority (TOA)—TOA is direct obligation authority plus accepted
reimbursable orders.

           BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR OPERATIONS

A2.1. The System's Purpose and Content:
   A2.1.1. The Future Year Defense Program (FYDP). The FYDP summarizes resources
   (forces, personnel and TOA for each appropriation) programmed for DoD—categorized by
   programs and related to the budget’s appropriation structure. See DoD 7045.7-H, Future
   Years Defense Program Structure, and DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Budget
   Formulation and Presentation.
      A2.1.1.1. The FYDP projects all data except forces for 5 years; forces extend an
      additional 3 years.
      A2.1.1.2. Carefully cost out the FYDP. Link plans and programs to desired program
      budget estimate levels and to approved program levels of budget authorities.
   A2.1.2. Budgeting and Accounting Systems. The budgeting system defines the
   requirement for future consumption of resources; the accounting system records the
   resources used. The accounting system for operations covers funds made available from the
   Operation and Maintenance (O&M), Military Personnel, Other Procurement, Military
   Construction Program (MCP) and Military Family Housing appropriations. This instruction
   emphasizes O&M and Military Personnel. (See Attachment 3 for details on the O&M
   Budget Activity Structure.)
   A2.1.3. Using Information. The accounting system for operations:
      A2.1.3.1. Allows analysts and managers to evaluate financial and program progress,
      determine budget requirements, and justify total resource requirements.
      A2.1.3.2. Applies elements of the FYDP (BAs and PEs) to all organizations
      (responsibility centers/cost centers) (RC/CCs) that accumulate operating costs by Air
      Force EEICs.
      A2.1.3.3. Provides obligation and expense information to formulate budgets and monitor
      actual execution against quarterly and annual budget targets. It also provides adequate
      fiscal controls and accounting techniques to properly account for appropriated funds.
A2.2. Support and Cost System Integration:
   A2.2.1. Transaction Data. The main transaction data comes from DFAS-Defense
   Accounting Office direct entry of information from obligation and commitment documents.
   (Examples are travel orders, purchase requests and orders for goods and services, and other
   Air Force contract and procurement documents.) Other automated support systems provide
   the remaining information.
   A2.2.2. Support Systems Interface. Three major support systems (Civilian Payroll,
   Military Personnel Expense and Automated Supply and Equipment) interface with the
   general accounting system.
      A2.2.2.1. See Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 for military personnel expense and civilian
      payroll procedures.
 60                                                              AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


      A2.2.2.2. The General Support, Medical-Dental, and Reparable Support divisions of the
      Defense Working Capital Fund provide update data that are processed periodically during
      the month and at month-end into the general accounting system. DFAS updates the
      status of funds for base resource managers and budget using current supply and
      equipment expense data generated by the periodic processing. RCMs, RAs and CCMs
      use the accounting system management reports and automated materiel system reports to
      monitor the execution of their execution plan.
   A2.2.3. Cost System Interface. The general accounting and finance system is the principal
   financial data source for input to the Interim Work Information Management System
   (IWIMS) and Vehicle Integrated Management System (VIMS). With minor modifications,
   the general accounting and finance system processes these systems' financial transactions.
   This single source of financial data for the cost system allows us to pass data back to the
   accounting system for reimbursement or to distribute material costs.
A2.3. Management Application of the Accounting System for Operations:
   A2.3.1. Management Controls. Other directives and instructions show how to manage
   resources and administer the budget in specific functional areas. The accounting system
   provides management control data that allows RC/CC managers and comptroller personnel to
   do financial analysis.
   A2.3.2. Undelivered Orders Outstanding (UOO). Usually, base services contracts are
   performed over a fairly long time period and it isn't appropriate to record them as expenses
   when the contract is awarded.
      A2.3.2.1. Charge the contract to an "undelivered orders" account and record it as an
      obligation -- not as an expense.
      A2.3.2.2. Upon completing the job, (the vendor provides the services or you get
      documentation showing incremental completion), charge the amount to expense and
      reduce the undelivered orders accounts.
      A2.3.2.3. The sum of current fiscal year expense incurred (accrued expenditures paid
      and unpaid) and current fiscal year undelivered orders will always equal current year
      obligations.
   A2.3.3. Project Fund Management Records (PFMR). Materiel requirements and
   associated financing are part of the base's available O&M fund authority. These are some
   management control techniques you use for the mechanized supply system.
   A2.3.4. Establish the quarterly phased dollar programs that apply to Expeditionary Combat
   Support System operations and the Standard Materiel Management System in the PFMRs.
   After the FMB approves the FWG recommended target distributions, resource advisors
   furnish the financial management analysis office internal operating budget targets within
   each PFMR by organization code and cost center code, if applicable.
      A2.3.4.1. Load targets into the Expeditionary Combat Support System.
      A2.3.4.2. Load targets by cost center code into the Standard Materiel Management
      System.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                     61


     A2.3.4.3. The total targets for all organization cost center records (OCCRs) can't exceed
     the total amount of the responsibility center approved target for the organization PFMR.
  A2.3.5. FMA summarizes the recommended distributions based on (1) the total supply and
  equipment approvals, and (2) the receipt of recommended organization and cost center
  distributions from resource advisors. FMA will enter the data into the applicable supply
  system. FMA should inform resource advisors if changes are made to the recommended
  distribution before final processing.
  A2.3.6. Establish separate PFMRs for the host and each Air Force tenant and additional
  PFMRs as necessary. (See Accounting and Finance and Supply directives).
     A2.3.6.1. Establish PFMRs by fund code, operating agency code (OAC), OBAN, budget
     project (for Military Family Housing) and budget activity (for O&M), at the RC/CC
     levels specified in MAJCOM instructions.
     A2.3.6.2. Use one combined PFMR for both supplies and equipment.
  A2.3.7. Reimbursable Program:
     A2.3.7.1. Reimbursable Authority. Reimbursable authority is available only when a
     customer order has been received. DoD Components must not authorize or incur an
     obligation or make a disbursement against anticipated reimbursements. Such actions must
     be delayed until the applicable customer order is received from Federal Government
     activities or funds are collected from public activities or those Federal activities not
     paying with an appropriation or any other form of budget authority. See DoD FMR
     7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 15 and Volume 14, Chapter 1 and AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
     Chapter 5 for further details.
         A2.3.7.1.1. For procurement and RDT&E appropriations, SAF/FMB transmits
         annual reimbursable authority (anticipated reimbursements) to the Commands.
         A2.3.7.1.2. For O&M, reimbursable authority is auto-apportioned. The Office of
         Management and Budget automatically apportions reimbursement authority at
         departmental level.    In this case, reimbursable authority equals earned
         reimbursements plus customer orders. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 5 for
         more details.
         A2.3.7.1.3. MAJCOMs/FOAs won't allot anticipated reimbursement unless they
         have reasonable assurance that the reimbursements will be collected. Even when
         reimbursements are apportioned or allotted, these estimates don't become budgetary
         resources available for obligations unless two conditions have been met:
            A2.3.7.1.3.1. Valid orders, including written agreements, have been received
            from and obligated by Federal Government-funded customers.
            A2.3.7.1.3.2. Advance payment has been collected, in the case of orders from the
            public or those Federal activities not paying with an appropriation or any other
            form of budget authority.
     A2.3.7.2. Credit appropriation reimbursements to the EEIC that most nearly identifies
     the nature of the materiel or service that originally provided it, except for transactions
     related to IWIMS, OLVIMS or any other management or cost system.
62                                                              AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


         A2.3.7.2.1. Use selected EEICs only when reporting the                  appropriation
         reimbursement transaction through a cost or management system.
         A2.3.7.2.2. Identify the sale of services or materiel to a specific EEIC. Only use
         EEIC 59900 if you can't identify the sale of services or materiel to a specific EEIC,
         and the sale isn't reported through a management or cost system. Use EEIC 59900 to
         record advance payments/collections receive from public activities or those Federal
         activities not paying with an appropriation or any other form of budget authority. Use
         MPC 9910 (advances received) in last 4 positions of the BPAC for Procurement and
         RDT&E accounts for the same purpose of recording advance payments/collections.
  A2.3.8. Program Element Predominancy Rule. Identify military and civilian personnel
  costs to the DoD program element (PE) as authorized in the unit authorization file extract.
     A2.3.8.1. Identify other expenses, excluding EEIC series 2XX and 1XX, to the
     appropriate DoD PE when you can do so with reasonable effort; otherwise, identify these
     costs to the RC/CC representing a predominant PE. (Validate through FMDD DQS)
     A2.3.8.2. Select the predominant PE based mainly on the manning authorizations
     assigned to a specific organization.
     A2.3.8.3. The most common users of the predominancy rule are weapon system
     maintenance activities who use common bench stocks for work on various aircraft.
     A2.3.8.4. Try to identify costs to the proper PE. Doing otherwise distorts aircraft
     maintenance cost factors developed by SAF/FMC because of inconsistencies in factors
     for like aircraft. These discrepancies make it more difficult to defend budget estimate
     submissions to OSD and Congress, and can lead to a loss in funding to the Air Force.
A2.4. Summary:
  A2.4.1. FYDP Relationship. Use the accounting system for operations to identify and code
  the costs of Air Force missions, budget activities and PEs to meet FYDP requirements. Use
  element of expense codes to identify the cost of operating base-level organizations and
  RC/CCs. By linking these data elements, the Air Force relates all operating costs to a major
  Air Force mission programmed in the FYDP.
  A2.4.2. System Structure. The accounting system for operations is structured along
  organizational lines because organizations manage and use resources. The operating reports
  available to management show consumption by type of resource (i.e., EEIC).
  A2.4.3. System Differences. The system focuses on the basic difference between resource
  acquisition and resource consumption. The differences involve the time of purchase and
  receipt of goods and services and the amounts of obligations and expenses:
     A2.4.3.1. Appropriation accounting is concerned with resource acquisition or obligation
     authority.
     A2.4.3.2. Accrual (expense) accounting reports the costs of resources used during the
     period.

                                 THE EXECUTION PLAN

A4.1. Overview:
   A4.1.1. Purpose. The basic purpose of the EP submission is to ensure an equitable
   distribution of the President’s Budget (PB) consistent with accomplishing Air Force program
   objectives and to produce a plan that executes within budgetary limitations while supporting
   the AF mission. The approximate submission schedule is:
      A4.1.1.1. Submit the EP after OMB submits the President's Budget to Congress, the first
      Monday in February, for the fiscal year that begins the following October 1. Submitting
      the EP approximately 4 months before the beginning of the upcoming fiscal year
      provides MAJCOMs, CoCOMs and other operating agencies current information to
      prepare to execute the next fiscal year’s budget.
      A4.1.1.2. The EP is the main vehicle for distributing anticipated funding (both direct and
      reimbursable) for the upcoming execution year in an equitable manner. It requires all
      organizational levels to contribute their corporate knowledge and expertise.
      A4.1.1.3. Budget and functional staffs participate at each management level, including
      financial and budget working groups at base, command and air staff.
A4.2. Elements of the Execution Plan:
   A4.2.1. The Commander's Statement. This statement includes assumptions, statements on
   force changes, mission changes, equipment changes, conversions and any other changes that
   will affect financial requirements. The Commander’s Statement should speak to the
   overarching risks/impacts within the command and provide an execution strategy overview.
   This assessment should clearly and concisely state commander’s intent within the constraints
   of both the bogey and guidance. It should also discuss any major trade-offs necessary to
   operate within the command bogey provided by SAF/FMB. The Commander’s Statement
   may be optional; check the O&M Execution Plan Call Guidance to determine if required.
   A4.2.2. The Annual Execution Plan (Mechanized). This section includes line item budget
   detail by BA, PE, EEIC, and ESP (if applicable). Funding can be moved in the command
   plan but must balance bottom line to the bogey and comply with all guidance and
   instructions.
   A4.2.3. Sub Activity Group Narratives. This section contains SAG Narratives categorized
   by SAF programs and mission areas as represented by Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS)
   panels. The purpose of the SAG narrative is to discuss the major cost drivers within each
   SAG and the trade-offs made in order to minimize risks and/or impacts. The SAG narrative
   should answer the following questions: 1) What capabilities are funded? 2) What capabilities
   are not funded? 3) What are the risks and impacts?
   A4.2.4. SAF Program Requirements.         Using the SAF-defined programs provide
   SAF/FMB the total unconstrained requirement in each of the categories. These requirement
   amounts will be used by SAF/FMBO for analysis purposes only.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                      65


  A4.2.5. Functional Realignments. Functional realignments are transfers of funding,
  programs, missions or manpower identified and submitted in the command execution plan.
  These realignments were either not identified or not processed during the POM. The four
  types of functional realignments are: OAC Transfers, Library, GSA Leases and Long Lease
  Lines. The realignment must identify a gaining and losing command. The realignment is
  detailed by OAC, PE, EEIC and amount, and both the gaining and losing commands must
  fully coordinate and approve prior to submission to SAF/FMBO. These functional
  realignments are submitted to SAF/FMBO in September and included in the respective
  command’s distribution.
  A4.2.6. Foreign Currency Requirements (Exhibit Q). The Exhibit Q is used to identify
  all foreign currency sensitive requirements. These requirements are converted into their
  respective foreign currency using the approved OSD budget rate. The identified
  requirements are consolidated at SAF/FMBO by command, country code, currency, PE and
  EEIC. This consolidated data is used to create the PB-18 Exhibit (Foreign Currency
  Exchange Data) to establish the AF funding level for the DoD Foreign Currency Fluctuation
  Account. This data is also used by SAF/FMBO to determine the command distribution of
  both increases and decreases to foreign currency funding provided in the PB.
  A4.2.7. Variance Analysis. The execution plan is a year round budget drill and includes the
  comparison of planned program execution to actual (variance analysis). This ongoing
  analysis provides valuable insight to better evaluate your overall planning. The analysis will
  be performed throughout the year during the Operating Budget Review Committee (OBRC)
  meetings. The variance analysis is conducted at SAF Program and Panel Level.

        CIVILIAN MANPOWER FUNDING, EXECUTION AND REPORTING

A6.1. Civilian Pay, Type of Payments To Employees and Compensation Computation.
   A6.1.1. Civilian Pay Cost Model. The output products described in Chapter 9 provide the
   baseline data inputs to the civilian pay cost model. When combined with other data, this
   model projects civilian personnel cost requirements for the Future Year Defense Program and
   related budget reports. This model estimates the civilian payroll impacts of anticipated
   changes in manpower utilization funding and program composition.
      A6.1.1.1. Program Analysis. Analysis of consolidated data shows management
      whether actual operations are in line with planned operations. It permits necessary future
      adjustment of operating budgets to keep approved expense authority consistent with
      actual and planned civilian personnel programs.
      A6.1.1.2. Types of Employment Positions:
          A6.1.1.2.1. A full-time employee is one scheduled to work regularly the number of
          hours or days required by the administrative workweek for their employment group.
          Full-time employees may occupy either permanent or other-than-permanent positions.
          A6.1.1.2.2. An established full-time permanent position is without time limit, or for a
          limited period of a year or more, or occupied for a year or more. The intent of
          establishing the position is not a relevant factor. The status (permanent or temporary)
          of an employee occupying a given position does not determine whether a position is
          permanent or other than permanent.
          A6.1.1.2.3. Positions other than full-time permanent include part-time, temporary
          and intermittent:
          A6.1.1.2.4. Part-time permanent employees have appointments that require work on
          a prearranged schedule of fewer hours or days of work than prescribed for full-time
          employees in the same group or class.
          A6.1.1.2.5. Temporary employees have appointments for a limited period of time
          that is generally less than a year. For example: full-time temporary employees,
          seasonal employees without permanent appointments, employees with term
          appointments and employees with indefinite appointments.
          A6.1.1.2.6. Intermittent employees have appointments that require work on an
          irregular or occasional basis and who are paid only for the time actually employed or
          services actually rendered.
      A6.1.1.3. The Civilian Manpower and Funding Report (RCS: DD-COMP (AR)
      1092) combines employment in full-time permanent and other-than-full-time permanent
      positions into major pay systems categories.
      A6.1.1.4. US Direct Hire (USDH). The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of
      1990 contains the federal employee salary schedule with grades and bases of pay for all
      employees occupying Classification Act positions. This includes full-time permanent,
      temporary, part-time and intermittent employment.
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                    71


     A6.1.1.5. U. S. Citizens, Prevailing Rate. In the Air Force, most positions excluded
     from coverage of the Classification Act, as amended, are subject to the pay determination
     jurisdiction of the DoD wage funding authority established under the Coordinated
     Federal Wage System. This system establishes prevailing rate schedules for specific
     wage localities.
     A6.1.1.6. Foreign National Direct Hire (FNDH). Under the direct hire system, the US
     Forces are the official employer of non-US citizen personnel and assume responsibility
     for all administrative and management functions about their employment. The provisions
     of a detailed operating agreement based upon a treaty or other formal action between the
     U.S. and other nations govern basic pay rates. U.S. determines the wages and salaries,
     usually based on locally prevailing rates. Report all direct hire non-US citizen
     employment in this category.
     A6.1.1.7. US Citizens, Youth Employment Programs, Direct Hire. This includes
     persons between the ages of 16 and 21 hired under the President's Youth Opportunity
     Program, (program provides meaningful employment opportunities for disadvantaged
     youths). Hire eligible youths under the Summer Youth Employment or Stay-in-School
     portions of the program. Appointments may be to either prevailing rate or Classification
     Act type positions, depending on Air Force needs and individual qualifications.
     A6.1.1.8. US Citizens, Other Wage Authority. This includes pay rates of employees
     occupying positions determined by wage-fixing authority other than the Classification
     Act, as amended, or wage funding authorities established under the Coordinated Federal
     Wage System. Report only U.S. citizens in these categories. Report all direct hire
     foreign nationals under the non-US citizens, direct hire category.
     A6.1.1.9. Indirect Hire Foreign National Personnel (FNIDH), Labor Contracts
     With Foreign Governments. The indirect hire system provides that the host
     government assume the responsibility for meeting the needs of US forces for local
     national personnel. Rates of pay normally conform to rates established and paid by the
     host government for comparable work in the area. Charge basic pay and separation
     allowances for non-US indirect hires to EEICs 16201 and 16211 respectively.
  A6.1.2. Types of Payments to Employees: Civilian pay is categorized into two main
  categories: compensation and benefits.
     A6.1.2.1. Basic Compensation. Includes an employee’s basic rate of regular salaries and
     wages.
     A6.1.2.2. Other Compensation. Compensation above the basic rates of pay to include
     overtime, holiday pay, night work differential, post differentials, hazardous duty pay,
     supervisory differential, cash incentive awards and other premium pay.
     A6.1.2.3. Personnel Benefits. Cash payments paid to other funds for the benefit of
     federal civilian employees and direct payments to the employee.
        A6.1.2.3.1. Includes insurance and annuities for the employer's share of life
        insurance, health insurance, employee retirement, work injury disabilities, death,
        Thrift Savings Plan and social security taxes. Includes recruitment, retention, and
        other incentives such as student loan payments, extended assignment incentive,
72                                                             AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012


        relocation (PCS), cost-of-living allowances, separate maintenance, education for
        dependents, and overseas differentials, etc. See OMB Circular A-11, Section 83.6 for
        additional authorized benefits.
  A6.1.3. Compensation Computation:
     A6.1.3.1. Compensable Hours. Compute employee's regular pay based on regular
     hours. Compensable hours, for a compensated employee, include periods of annual or
     sick leave and time off for legal holidays. Exclude overtime or other premium pay hours.
     A fiscal year has 2080, 2088 or 2096 compensable hours.
     A6.1.3.2. Workyears. A workyear is the equivalent of one employee being in a pay
     status for the number of compensable hours in a fiscal year or more than one employee
     being in a pay status part of the year for which the total hours paid are equal to the
     number of compensable hours in the fiscal year. Workyear equivalents represent a part
     of a total workyear actually used during any fractional part of the fiscal year.
        A6.1.3.2.1. The Civilian Manpower and Funding Report system computes workyear
        equivalents for each month by dividing the number of compensable hours used during
        the month by the number of compensable hours in the year.
            A6.1.3.2.1.1. For example, March 2013 has 184 compensable hours (23 days
            times 8 hours) and FY 2013 has 2,088 compensable hours (261 days times 8
            hours). Assume you used 18,400 compensable hours during May, then the
            workyear equivalent is 8.81 (18,400 divided by 2,088).
     A6.1.3.3. Average Costs Computation:
        A6.1.3.3.1. Compute the basic average salary by dividing the total obligations for
        base pay of each type of employment by the applicable worker equivalents or
        workyears for a given month, quarter or year. For example, assuming May 2013 total
        obligations for General Schedule employment of $264,300 and a workyear equivalent
        of 8.81, the basic average salary would be $264,300 divided by 8.81 or $30,000.00.
        A6.1.3.3.2. Compute the overall average salary by dividing the total obligations for
        total personnel compensation for each type of employment by the applicable
        workyear equivalents or workyears for a given month or quarter of the year.
        Continuing with the example and assuming May total obligations for General
        Schedule employment of $217,800, then the overall average salary would be
        $272,300 divided by a workyear equivalent of 8.81, or $30,908.06 (rounded to
        $30,908).
        A6.1.3.3.3. Compute workyear cost by dividing the total obligations for total
        personnel compensation and benefits of each type of employment by the applicable
        workyear equivalents or workyears for a given month, quarter or year. Continuing
        with the example, and assuming fourth quarter total obligations for General Schedule
        employment to be $984,244, then the work-year cost would be $984,244 divided by a
        workyear equivalent of 25.29, or $38,918.30 (rounded to $38,918).
     A6.1.3.4. Manpower Utilization.        Compute based on the relationship between
     compensable time used and compensable time available during a given period (day,
     month, quarter or fiscal year). Table 9.1. includes the number of available workdays for
AFI65-601V2 18 MAY 2012                                                                   73


     each month and quarter, fiscal years 2011-2013. Express manpower utilization data with
     workhour, workday, workmonth or workyear equivalents. Table 9.2. shows examples of
     the various relationships.
     A6.1.3.5. Manpower Conversion. When the utilization is in one of the terms,
     (workhours, workdays, workmonths, workquarters or workyears), convert it to any of the
     other terms by applying the following formulas. Table 9.2. provides data used to
     illustrate these formulas. Round accounts for slight variances.
        A6.1.3.5.1. Workhours Are Known:
            A6.1.3.5.1.1. Convert to workdays by dividing the number of compensable hours
            used by the number of compensable hours in the period and multiplying the result
            by the number of compensable days in the period. For example, May workhour
            use of 18,400 hours divided by 184 hours equals 100, times 23 days, equals 2300
            workdays.
            A6.1.3.5.1.2. Convert to workmonths by dividing the number of compensable
            hours used by the number of compensable hours in the period and multiply the
            result by the number of months in the period. For example, first quarter workhour
            use of 52,800 hours divided by 528 hours equals 100, times 3 months, equals 300
            workmonths.
            A6.1.3.5.1.3. Convert to workquarter equivalents by dividing the number of
            compensable hours used by the number of compensable hours in the quarter. For
            example, May workhour use of 18,400 hours divided by 528 hours equals 34.85
            workquarter equivalents.
            A6.1.3.5.1.4. Convert to workyear equivalents by dividing the number of
            compensable hours used by the number of compensable hours in the year. For
            example, first quarter workhour use of 52,800 hours divided by 2,088 equals
            25.28 workyear equivalents.
        A6.1.3.5.2. Workdays Are Known:
            A6.1.3.5.2.1. Convert to workhours by dividing the number of compensable days
            used by the number of compensable days in the period and multiplying the result
            by the number of compensable hours in the period. For example, May workday
            use of 2,300 days divided by 23 days equals 100, times 184 hours, equals 18,400
            workhours.

           A6.1.3.5.5.5. Conversion Formulas Recap. The foregoing formulas illustrate that
           it is possible to compute utilization data in any terms when you know actual
           utilization in one of the terms. In addition, the formulas permit a single formula
           to apply equally to utilization during any part of a fiscal year.
              A6.1.3.5.5.5.1. Recognize that:
                A6.1.3.5.5.5.1.1. Known hours used produces the most accurate utilization.
                A6.1.3.5.5.5.1.2. In most instances, you lose some minor degree of
                accuracy when applying the formulas to convert from other than actual
                workhours.
                A6.1.3.5.5.5.1.3. Simplify some of the formulas departing from data
                presented in the manpower utilization sample or when applied to the
                utilization data for only one month. As an example:
                A6.1.3.5.5.5.1.4. To simplify the formula for converting workhours to
                workdays, as stated in paragraph A6.12.22 divide the workhour utilization
                for any period by the number of compensable hours in a day (8).

     A6.1.3.5.5.5.1.5. For quarterly data, follow the formula for converting
     workhours to workmonths, as stated in paragraph A6.12.23. But, to
     simplify when applying the formula to data for a single month, because it
     produces the same result either by dividing the number of compensable
     hours used by the number of compensable hours in the period and
     multiplying the result by the number of months in the period (1) or simply
     by dividing the number of compensable hours used by the number of
     compensable hours in the period (1 month).
