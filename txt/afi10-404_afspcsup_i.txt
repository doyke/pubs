This instruction implements AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning, and provides for the preparation of base
support plans (BSP), and expeditionary site plans (ESP); and the accomplishment of contingency site sur-
veys across the spectrum of USAF operations for deliberate and crisis action planning and execution. It
describes the specific requirements to translate and integrate operational requirements into Agile Combat
Support and Expeditionary Combat Support (ACS/ECS) at employment sites to create and sustain opera-
tions. This instruction applies to ANG and AFRC units.

(AFSPC) This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-404,
Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning, 9 March 2004. The AFI is published word-for-word

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2004-1. This change to AFI 10-404, Base Support and
Expeditionary Site Planning integrates the In-garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP) and the Expedi-
tionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) into the plan. The IGESP is primarily developed for locations with a
permanent Air Force presence, and is fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many func-
tional experts with a deliberate planning time line. IGESPs were formerly known as Base Support Plans
(BSPs). The ESSP improves our capability to effectively identify potential operational locations and col-
lect, store, and access site data in support of the warfighter decision-making process. This process will
provide decision-makers with standardized, substantive, and reliable site survey information essential to
successful mission accomplishment. Furthermore, standardization of the ESSP process will lead to a
greater understanding of responsibilities at all levels, and greatly improves our expeditionary capability.

            BASE SUPPORT AND EXPEDITIONARY SITE PLANNING CONCEPTS

1.1. Objectives. The objectives of in-garrison expeditionary site plans (IGESP) and expeditionary site
planning (ESP) are to determine capabilities and apply them to contingency operations. The Expedition-
ary Site Survey Process (ESSP) is a subset of the overall expeditionary site planning process. Expedition-
ary site planning is the foundation for Air Force expeditionary operations; this AFI is the governing
document for the ESSP. It provides the focus, guidance, and integration, and prioritizes the actions for the
site survey teams. It provides the necessary detailed information required by planners at all levels--strate-
gic, operational, and tactical. Whether they are developing the Air Campaign, the aircraft basing plan sup-
porting the air campaign, or preparing to deploy a unit forward to execute the plan – each requires similar
information with which to begin planning. The primary difference between the three examples is the level
of detail required to execute their planning. The ESSP provides the expeditionary site planning process a
standard operational method for data collection and data storage for potential operating locations.
    1.1.1. Part I of the in-garrison and expeditionary site plan identifies resources and capabilities of a
    location by functional area and is the focus of the expeditionary site survey. For contingency require-
    ments, Part II of the plan allocates resources identified in Part I, assesses the ability to support the
    operation, and identifies limiting factors (LIMFACs). It is through these plans that all units operating
    out of the location become familiar with the existing resource allocations and key tactics, techniques,
    and procedures (TTPs).
    1.1.2. The ESSP is a strategic vision that defines the site survey process in operational and tactical
    terms. Air Force units and personnel should plan and execute site surveys by using the ESSP to plan
    employment, reception and beddown, employment, and sustainment of air and space expeditionary
    forces.
    1.1.3. The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense (DOD) DOD Reorganization Act of 1986
    established the operational chain of command for the DOD from the President to the Secretary of
    Defense to the combatant commanders. Title 10, United States Code 163, the Unified Command Plan
    (UCP) direct that communications between the President/Secretary of Defense and the combatant
    commanders be transmitted through the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). The commanders of
    combatant commands exercise command authority (CoCom) of assigned forces and are directly
    responsible to the President and Secretary of Defense for the performance of assigned missions and
    preparedness of their commands. There are nine combatant commanders with five having geographic
    responsibilities. These combatant commanders are each assigned an Area of Responsibility (AOR) by
    the UCP and are responsible for all operations within their designated areas; U.S. Southern Command,
    U.S. Central Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Northern Com-
    mand (includes Homeland Defense). During wartime, the Commander of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK),
    which is a subordinate command to USPACOM in peacetime, becomes the Commander, United
    Nations Command, and Commander of the Republic of Korea (ROK)-U.S. Combined Forces Com-
    mand. The other four combatant commanders have worldwide functional responsibilities not bounded
    by geography: U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Transportation
    Command, and U.S. Joint Forces Command. Assigned to each of these combatant commands is an Air
    Force component command. At the operational level, the component command commander advocates
    air and space power, provides expertise and advice to the combatant commander, and exercises
    day-to-day command authority over air and space forces. Each Air Force component command will
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                           9


   have a program office responsible for site survey planning and execution. The responsible Air Force
   component command program office will work with Combatant Commander planning staffs to
   develop a theater-wide Site Survey Priority List (SSPL). The program office will also orchestrate the
   execution of site surveys in coordination with Air Mobility Command and supporting agencies to
   ensure site data is collected, stored, and accessible worldwide in accordance with the standardized
   ESSP defined by this AFI. Figure 1.1., Military Command Relationships, depicts the chain of com-
   mand that affects expeditionary site planning, the level of involvement (Strategic, Operational, or Tac-
   tical), and the command relationship between key players in the process.

Figure 1.1. Military Command Relationships.




1.2. Products. The expeditionary site planning process produces an In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan
(IGESP) and an Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP). IGESPs are primarily developed for locations with a per-
manent Air Force presence, and are fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many func-
tional experts with a deliberate planning time line. ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a
permanent Air Force presence and may contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial beddown
decisions (quick reaction site survey information in Part I). ESPs may be developed in short time frames
to meet contingency needs without full staffing or coordination. IGESPs and ESPs follow the format tem-
plates in the attachments to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning or the Survey Tool
for Employment Planning application. The new Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) defines the
capability and procedures to effectively identify potential operational locations and collect, store, and
access site data in support of warfighter decision-making processes. This process will provide deci-
sion-makers with substantive and reliable site survey information essential to performing their jobs well.
Furthermore, the standardization of the process will enable the process to move faster, lead to a greater
10                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


understanding of responsibilities at all levels, and a greatly improve the quality and usefulness of expedi-
tionary site planning data.

1.3. Processes. Agile combat support (ACS) is a core competency of the Air Force and includes the pro-
cesses that create, sustain, and protect all aerospace capabilities necessary to accomplish mission objec-
tives across the spectrum of conflict. It is the product of processes that ready the force, prepare the battle
space and position, employ, sustain, and recover the force. Expeditionary combat support (ECS) is the tai-
lored ACS capability deployed to expeditionary sites to provide for Aerospace Expeditionary Forces
(AEF) employed and engaged in operations. This capability is produced by rapidly deployable, tailored
forces executing ACS processes to beddown, employ, maintain, protect, and redeploy tactical components
of air and space power and production. As part of ACS and ECS, the expeditionary site planning process
defines capability, establishes resource allocation, and determines solutions to shortages/limitations. A
rigorous expeditionary site planning process is essential to determine contingency beddown locations,
deployment requirements, tailoring decisions, and resource allocations. Where existing capabilities fall
short of mission requirements, this process facilitates decisions for successfully sustaining the mission.
The process result is an IGESP/ESP that defines the information necessary for making beddown, recep-
tion, and deployment-planning decisions. The collaborative planning required by all functional areas to
create a coordinated/integrated ESP results in the maximum benefit of the process. At the unit level it rep-
resents a capability assessment and an employment plan for the tactical level. For MAJCOM/NAF/Air
Component staffs, it quantifies theater/AOR support capabilities at the operational level. At HQ USAF, it
presents service level data for strategic level planning and requirements determination.
     1.3.1. This Air Force Instruction is the governing document for the ESSP. It provides the focus, guid-
     ance, and integration, and prioritizes the actions for the site survey teams. It provides the necessary
     detailed information required by planners at all levels--strategic, operational, and tactical.

1.4. Systems Support. The Logistician’s Contingency Assessment Tools (LOGCAT) is a NIPRNET/
SIPRNET-based suite of standard systems tools that enables automated, employment-driven, agile com-
bat support planning. LOGCAT supports the expeditionary site planning process by accurately and rap-
idly identifying resources and combat support requirements at potential employment locations, providing
beddown capability analysis and LIMFAC identification, and facilitating force tailoring decisions to
reduce the overall deployment footprint. LOGCAT consists of three components that are mandated for use
when they are available at all levels of command. LOGCAT users are required to obtain a LOGCAT
NIPRNET/SIPRNET user password from their MAJCOM office.
     1.4.1. Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP). Partially automates the overall expeditionary
     site planning process and standardizes IGESP/ESP products via a sophisticated, multimedia tool for
     the collection of site data. STEP is designed for in-garrison or deployed configurations, and incorpo-
     rates functionally based checklists to methodically capture site survey data in a standardized formats.
     STEP organizes survey data to facilitate beddown analysis and LIMFAC identification. STEP enables
     IGESP/ESP development with separate Part I and Part II modules. STEP provides a Part I capability
     that facilitates Part II development. Use of STEP for developing IGESP/ESPs is mandatory. Units
     unable to use STEP Part II for IGESP/ESPs (as a result of no SIPRNET connectivity or other reasons)
     must request a waiver from HQ USAF/ILGD through the appropriate MAJCOM/LGX or equivalent.
     Waiver requests should include, as a minimum, the reason why STEP cannot be used, resolution
     actions, get well date, and temporary work-around solution.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                                11


    1.4.1. (AFSPC) Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP). Initial waiver requests to USAF/
    A4R will be processed through the AFSPC Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning functional
    manager (HQ AFSPC/A4RDX). Monthly updates from AFSPC wings to AFSPC/A4RDX will iden-
    tify get well dates, temporary work around solutions and resolution actions to close the initial waiver
    request.
    1.4.2. Employment Knowledge Base (EKB). EKB is the LOGCAT database that stores all STEP-pro-
    duced IGESPs and ESPs. It also contains National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) airfield
    data, and other information critical to contingency beddown planning. LOGCAT users are to enter
    Part I data via the NIPRNET only. Part I data on the classified network will be updated via the data
    synchronization capability from the unclassified STEP. (WARNING) Never update Part I data while
    in the Part II (SIPRNET) portion of the EKB.
    1.4.3. Beddown Capability Assessment Tool (BCAT). BCAT is a robust decision support tool for
    assessing the extent to which base/site capabilities can support planned mission activities over a des-
    ignated period of time. BCAT processes data from multiple sources including the EKB (survey data
    captured using STEP) to perform a day-to-day assessment by comparing mission requirements to site
    capabilities for petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL), munitions, parking, lodging, meals, and to a lim-
    ited extent, airlift throughput. With information generated by the analysis, BCAT presents LIMFACs
    using various graphical and tabular presentation modes. From the results, planners can anticipate the
    future need for capabilities and make informed decisions to mitigate LIMFACs. BCAT analysis sup-
    ports IGESP Part II and ESP development.

1.5. ESSP Enablers. Worldwide accessibility to data storage is possible and necessary for planning accu-
racy and risk analysis of intended expeditionary sites. Planners and surveyors must be able to take advan-
tage of the Department of Defense Communications network, the Global Command and Control System
(GCCS) and Global Combat Support System (GCSS) infrastructures. Data collected in the field must be
transported to data stores in time to support impending operations. Planners must have access to the most
current data to advise senior leaders on courses of action concerning expeditionary site selection. Data
sharing will eliminate redundancy in collection efforts and help in right sizing deploying forces.

1.6. Integrated Data Collection Tools and Equipment. Standardized tools are integral to effective collec-
tion, storage, and access of data gathered during a site survey. Collecting data accurately and reliably
requires site survey teams to use standardized tools to support the site survey process. Integrated data col-
lection tools and equipment are designed and utilized to collect tabular and geospatial data. The corner-
stone of these tools is the site survey checklist and its integration of tabular and geospatial data. The Wing
Commander-scanned certification page should be imported via multimedia into the General Site Informa-
tion Chapter. The responsible MAJCOM, in coordination with the appropriate Air Force Component, will
determine certification authority in cases where the wing/installation commander cannot be the Certifying
official; i.e., lead wing commander or air force component commander. The Air Force Component Com-
mander may delegate this responsibility. Other Site Survey Checklist data fields not included within the
LOGCAT system should be populated within the miscellaneous field. It is designed to prioritize func-
tional team member actions and facilitate the sharing of information while preventing duplication of
effort. Properly trained personnel will be able to utilize these tools to collect integrated site data. The stan-
dardized tools focus the team and optimize activities, especially when situation restrictions may limit time
available on the ground at the site. MAJCOMs or other higher headquarters must plan for and acquire the
equipment required by their site survey teams. The headquarters must ensure requirements are identified

and submitted as part of the United States Air Force Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for fund-
ing. Each site survey team will have its own equipment. Equipment should be compatible with current
expeditionary site planning standards. This equipment will include both functional area-unique and com-
mon equipment. Equipment must meet the following standards:
     1.6.1. Equipment must comply with guidelines for preventing unauthorized transfer of technology
     1.6.2. Equipment should be unclassified
     1.6.3. Equipment must be transportable by commercial means
     1.6.4. Equipment must fit in suitcase-sized carriers

                                 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General. This chapter describes functional area roles and responsibilities for the planning, prepara-
tion, and execution of the expeditionary site planning and survey processes. Both processes significantly
impact beddown and campaign plan decisions for all military branches. Consequently, roles and responsi-
bilities must be clearly defined and unambiguous. Therefore, it is important that each organization's role
is known and understood by all involved. The following cross-functional responsibilities touch many
organizations and agencies and depict the basic responsibilities of each level of command.
   2.1.1. Cross-Functional Responsibilities for IGESP/ESP. The format for IGESP/ESP is by functional
   chapters, and templates for each are included as attachments to this instruction. The table of contents
   of this instruction specifies the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for each chapter. Functional
   OPRs are responsible for ensuring the template includes the functional content necessary to meet
   expeditionary site planning objectives.
   2.1.2. Cross-Functional Responsibilities for Expeditionary Site Planning Standard Systems Applica-
   tions. The rule-based logic contained in BCAT or its replacement is derived from functional area pol-
   icy, technical data, and subject matter expert experience – examples include aircraft parking space
   data, aircraft refueling flow rates, meal consumption data, etc. The “electronic checklist” in STEP is
   derived from widely used checklists and functional expert input. Functional area managers are respon-
   sible for keeping BCAT rules and STEP data elements current through coordination with AF/ILGD,
   and the respective MAJCOM and expeditionary site planning OPR as appropriate.

2.2. The Directorate of Logistics Readiness (HQ USAF/ILG). Responsible for the Air Force Expedition-
ary Site Survey Planning process, policy, and guidance.
   2.2.1. Provides oversight of USAF contingency site survey process. Assist lead MAJCOMs efforts to
   de-conflict competing site survey requirements/resources when necessary.
   2.2.2. Exercises management control over the expeditionary site planning program to insure avail-
   ability of accurate and current data for contingency logistics planning. Perform quarterly review of
   EKB data for currency based on scheduled MAJCOM actions for IGESP/ESP entries/updates. During
   the interim period of LOGCAT fielding, assess data currency by coordinating quarterly with MAJ-
   COMs that are unable to use STEP and the EKB.
   2.2.3. Manages supporting standard systems applications, and is the OPR for LOGCAT. Chairs the
   LOGCAT Functional Requirements Board (FRB).

2.3. MAJCOM/Command Logistics Plans Function. Provides command policy and guidance for imple-
menting in-garrison expeditionary support (IGESP), and expeditionary site planning (ESP) concepts to
meet their specific missions.
   2.3.1. Ensure all subordinate bases develop IGESP Part I. Coordination of this requirement with other
   services may require service component agreements at MAJCOM level if the AF unit is a tenant a Sis-
   ter Service location.
   2.3.2. Ensure subordinate bases with support/combat responsibilities (i.e. reception, throughput,
   training, etc.) develop IGESP Part II. At locations where USAF is not the host component, coordina-
14                                                                       AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


     tion of this requirement with other services may require service component agreements at MAJCOM
     level if the AF unit is a tenant a Sister Service location.
     2.3.3. To facilitate management control, maintain a roster of subordinate bases (including forward
     operating locations where USAF may or may not maintain a presence) that require either an IGESP or
     ESP. Follow the format in Figure 2.1. (sort the locations based on the next activity date), classify
     appropriately, and forward to HQ USAF/ILGD on a quarterly basis (end of Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct).
     2.3.3. (AFSPC) AFSPC installations will forward their In-Garrison Expeditionary Support Plan
     (IGESP) status to HQ AFSPC/A4RDX NLT the 15th of Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct for consolidation into
     the MAJCOM Roster. Minimum information required is IGESP Part I date, IGESP Part II date (if
     applicable), In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC) date, next activity (e.g.
     annual review, under revision, new requirement, etc.), and when Employment Knowledge Base
     (EKB) was uploaded. Follow the format in Figure 2.1.

        tribution Objective (WCDO)/War Plans Additives Requirements Roster (WPARR) requirement. If
        none of these requirements exist for your installation, a Part 2 is not required.
     2.3.4. Identify a point of contact (POC) to HQ USAF/ILGD for all MAJCOM related expeditionary
     site planning issues. The MAJCOM POC represents the respective MAJCOM at the LOGCAT FRB
     and is a voting member.
     2.3.4. (AFSPC) The AFSPC in-garrison expeditionary site planning and expeditionary site planning
     functional manager (AFSPC/A4RDX) is the point of contact for subordinate installations and repre-
     sents the command at the Air Force LOGCAT Functional Review Board (FRB).

  2.3.5. Provide planning information to subordinate units (i.e., all forces time-phased force deploy-
  ment data (TPFDD), war consumables distribution objective (WCDO), war plans additive require-
  ments report (WPARR), vehicle authorization list (VAL), War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), etc.)
  and identify baseline-planning data for IGESP/ESP development.
  2.3.5. (AFSPC) Installations can access the all-forces time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD)
  and the VAL through DCAPES and the Automated Fleet Integrated System (AFIS), respectively. With
  regards to the WCDO, WPARR, and Wartime Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR), HQ AFSPC/A4RDX
  is the OPR.
  2.3.6. Develop a review process for IGESP/ESPs in coordination with the responsible numbered Air
  Force (NAF). Request MAJCOM functional area support to provide plan inputs for those areas where
  functional expertise does not exist within the subordinate unit or NAF. Where appropriate, coordinate
  with host wing, host wing NAF, and host wing MAJCOM logistics plans agencies during review pro-
  cess. Maximize LOGCAT applications to expedite and standardize overall review process.
  2.3.7. Monitor subordinate unit limiting factor (LIMFAC) reports in coordination with the appropri-
  ate NAF. Staff validated LIMFACs with appropriate MAJCOM/Command functional managers for
  resolution actions. As appropriate, coordinate resolution actions and prioritization of effort with MAJ-
  COM senior staff, and NAF. Maintain a database of LIMFAC status and issue resolution.
  2.3.8. Develop policy for performing staff assistance visits (SAVs) with subordinate units as required.
  The purpose of SAVs is to review the overall expeditionary site planning process, provide guidance,
  clarification, and training. The SAV program should be executed in coordination with responsible
  NAFs.
  2.3.9. Coordinate with MAJCOM Inspector General (IG) to ensure proper evaluation of in-garrison
  and expeditionary site planning processes and products across all functional areas.
  2.3.10. Manage all MAJCOM related aspects of fielding, using, and sustaining expeditionary site
  planning standard systems applications such as LOGCAT and or its replacement.
  2.3.11. Provide oversight of MAJCOM contingency site survey processes. Develop policy to insure
  site survey information is collected with STEP and stored in the EKB when possible. Avoid duplica-
  tion of effort, and ensure enough data is collected during site surveys to facilitate beddown analysis
  with BCAT as appropriate. Assist AMC/A3 with the development and maintenance of the Site Survey
  Priority List (SSPL) for near-term (two years) site surveys at locations that are most likely to be used
  for primary missions, humanitarian assistance operations, or unique MAJCOM/AOR requirements.
  SSPLs should be developed in concert with supported commands, subordinate units, and contingency
  taskings. Update SSPLs semiannually, classify as appropriate, and forwarded to HQ USAF/ILGD
  NLT 31 March and 30 September each year. MAJCOMs and Centers (AETC, AFMC, AFRC, and
  ANG) without an AOR responsibility are exempt from the SSPL report.

     2.3.12. Identify to subordinate NAF and wing logistics plans functions their roles and responsibilities
     in meeting expeditionary site planning objectives.
     2.3.13. Identify and resolve IGESP and ESP issues impacting other MAJCOM units, including Air
     National Guard and Air Force Reserve units with their respective MAJCOM logistics plans functions.

2.4. Other MAJCOM Agencies.
     2.4.1. Inspector General (IG). Evaluate expeditionary site planning processes and products. Coordi-
     nate with the MAJCOM expeditionary site planning OPR for evaluation guidelines and metrics.
     2.4.2. MAJCOM Functional Managers. Take appropriate action to resolve subordinate unit LIM-
     FACs. Coordinate efforts with MAJCOM logistics plans function and the appropriate NAF agencies.
     2.4.2. (AFSPC) MAJCOM Functional Managers. Limiting Factors (LIMFAC) will be coordinated
     with AFSPC/A4RDX only after the coordination process through the NAF is complete.
     2.4.3. Coordinate all site survey requests with the MAJCOM logistics plans function to prevent dupli-
     cation and permit proper prioritization of efforts, and ensure site survey information is collected with
     STEP and stored in the EKB when possible.
     2.4.3. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A4RDX is the manager for all contingency site survey requests and the
     final approval authority. Coordination will be done through the NAF prior to the request coming to
     HQ AFSPC.
     2.4.4. Provide assistance and inputs for IGESP/ESP development when functional expertise is not
     resident at subordinate levels.
     2.4.5. Further refine functional chapter and/or ESP requirements to reflect unique AOR and/or MAJ-
     COM necessities. Include these refinements in a MAJCOM instruction or supplement to this docu-
     ment.

2.5. Air Force Component Command (MAJCOM/NAF in component role) Logistics Plans Func-
tion. Responsible, with the assistance of appropriate functional managers, for the following in addition to
the applicable responsibilities in paragraph 2.3.
     2.5.1. Review AOR wartime and contingency requirements and identify all aircraft, personnel (to
     include noncombatant evacuees and all services), and equipment competing for base resources.
     Review all other planning efforts to include base operability actions, reception task force responsibil-
     ities, command and control structures, facility and utility usage, security requirements, noncombatant

   evacuation planning (to include Safe Haven operations), tenant planning involvement, and host-nation
   support.
   2.5.2. Sponsor, host, and fund USAF participation in applicable IGESP and ESP conferences at
   USAF beddown and en route support locations within their AORs. Specifically, ACC is responsible
   for SOUTHCOM, JFCOM, and CENTCOM AORs, USAFE is responsible for EUCOM AOR,
   PACAF is responsible for PACOM AOR, and responsible parent MAJCOMs for CONUS based
   installations. MAJCOMs may delegate any or all of these responsibilities to subordinate NAF/wing
   within the AOR.
   2.5.3. Facilitate the development of ESPs for beddown or support locations in their AOR that do not
   have a major Air Force presence. All efforts will be made to develop ESPs with Parts I and II -- as a
   minimum, develop the ESP Part I. When the host country severely restricts access to a location, the
   ESP should be completed to the extent possible with ongoing efforts to complete the plan. Coordina-
   tion of this requirement with other services may require service component agreements at MAJCOM
   or COMBATANT COMMANDER level.
   2.5.4. Validate/monitor unit level LIMFACs in coordination with appropriate NAF/MAJCOM func-
   tional agencies.
   2.5.5. Coordinate all site survey requests with MAJCOM logistics plans function to prevent duplica-
   tion of effort and permit proper prioritization of survey requirements.

2.6. Other Air Force Component Command (MAJCOM/NAF in component role) Staff Functions. Pro-
vide guidance and assistance as necessary for developing and/or reviewing IGESP/ESP functional chap-
ters. Coordinate all site survey requests with the MAJCOM logistics plans function and insure site survey
information is collected with STEP and stored in the EKB when possible.
2.6. (AFSPC) Other Air Force Component Command (MAJCOM/NAF in component role) Staff
Functions. Requests for site surveys of AFSPC installations by non-AFSPC units will be coordinated
through HQ AFSPC/A4RDX after coordination with the appropriate NAF.

2.7. Deploying Unit Commander. Coordinate all site survey requests with AOR and parent MAJCOM
logistics plans function. Review IGESP/ESPs for locations their units are tasked to deploy to or transit
through. Deploying unit commanders will coordinate with and advise the reception base or transit loca-
tion of unique support requirements, suggested changes, or other impacts on reception planning. Units are
encouraged to participate in site surveys or planning conferences at their deployment locations to coordi-
nate requirements and plan for the most effective use of resources. Every effort should be taken to accom-
plish ESP site surveys or planning conferences in conjunction with scheduled deployments and/or
exercise participation. These visits facilitate the development of viable IGESP/ESPs, and provide the
deploying units the opportunity to tailor their deployment packages to eliminate duplication and reduce
reception and transportation requirements.

2.8. Host Wing/Installation Commander. Ensure IGESP is developed and maintained as directed by the
MAJCOM. When delegated by MAJCOM, budgets to host representatives from major deploying units to
assist in development of Part II and subsequent refinements. Support the overall process through the
in-garrison expeditionary site planning committee (IGESPC). Coordinate all site survey requests with
MAJCOM logistics plans function. Retain final signature authority on IGESP documents and validation
authority on electronic information transmitted and stored in the EKB. Chair the Planning Committee.

       2.9.6.6. Copies of Inspection Reports (applicable local and higher headquarters inspection find-
       ings, SAV reports, self-inspection findings, etc.).
       2.9.6.7. LIMFAC program documentation.
       2.9.6.8. Miscellaneous (issues, lessons learned, message traffic, training slides, handbooks, and
       any comments which would add to the understanding of the expeditionary site planning process).
       2.9.6.9. IGESP/ESP POC appointment letter.
   2.9.7. Develop and maintain local policy and procedures for implementation and usage of LOGCAT
   at base level. Insure local certification and system administration requirements are addressed.
   2.9.7. (AFSPC) The LOGCAT User-ID Request Form DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access
   Request (SAAR) located on the AFSPC/A4RDX webpage (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/
   OpenCop.asp?Filter=OO-LG-SP-30) is used to request/authorize access to the EKB and will be
   submitted to AFSPC/A4RDX. AFSPC/A4RDX will then coordinate with SSG and DISA-Montgom-
   ery who controls access to the EKB.
       2.9.7.1. Coordinate with the local network security office for software installation authorization
       2.9.7.2. Maintain a LOGCAT user account roster. Inform MAJCOM LOGCAT Super Planner
       when access is no longer required (changed jobs, PCS, retire, etc.).
   2.9.8. Maintain visibility and forward notification of local site survey requirements to respective
   NAF and HHQ. Insure information is validated and loaded into LOGCAT, as appropriate.

2.10. In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC). (See paragraph 3.3. for specifics)
The IGESPC is a deliberate planning body chaired by the wing commander. Its primary function is to
actively integrate the efforts of all base-level organizations involved in preparing an IGESP.

2.11. Wing/Base Level Units (Including Tenant Units). All commanders and functional area experts,
regardless of command, are responsible for development, management, and review of their portions of the
IGESP. IGESP chapter OPRs will maintain continuity books (see paragraph 2.9.6.) to ensure succeeding
personnel are aware of how the chapter was developed (include internal checklists, formulas used, etc.).
Coordinate all site survey requests with wing logistics plans function to prevent duplication of effort and
permit proper prioritization of requirements. Each unit on base will compare capabilities against contin-
20                                                                AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


gency requirements and identify those constraints having a critical negative effect on a base's war fighting
capability. These constraints will be reviewed by the unit commander and submitted to the logistics plans
function for review by the IGESPC. LIMFACs are personnel or materiel deficiencies, problems, or condi-
tions (validated by the IGESPC) that have a critical negative impact on the ability of a unit to perform its
wartime mission, and require the aid of higher headquarters to resolve. Units will monitor reported LIM-
FACs and submit updates should changes occur (e.g., LIMFAC becomes invalid, outdated, etc.). Con-
straints, which do not meet IGESP LIMFAC criteria, should be identified as such (e.g., constraint,
shortfall, etc.) and included in the plan.
2.11. (AFSPC) Wing/Base Level Units (Including Tenant Units). Units consider the most stringent
requirements with respect to DW-coded assets and consider the vulnerabilities of DXX coded UTCs for
AEF Deployments. Units will consider capabilities and limiting factors (LIMFACs) with respect to
throughput/beddown activities for transient forces and include in-place mission impacts under all these
conditions.

2.12. Installation Exercise/Inspection Function. Wing IG or equivalent; establish a program in coopera-
tion with the installation logistics plans function to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the reception
and beddown process. Installations will conduct local reception and beddown exercises at the discretion
of their MAJCOM. Reception and beddown exercises can be combined with other local exercises at the
host commander’s discretion. Exercise scenarios should be based on real world expectations of simulta-
neous deployment, reception, beddown, and integration of forces. All IGESP participants should be
involved in building the exercise scenario. Exercise evaluation results will be included in the IGESPC
minutes.

2.13. ESSP Roles and Responsibilities. Individuals involved in the site survey process must understand
the relationships between the various organizations involved in the process and what unique function each
provides to its successful outcome.
     2.13.1. HQ USAF/ILG:
        2.13.1.1. Develop doctrine; develop policy, guidance, and procedures on site survey process.

        2.13.6.1. Perform site surveys as directed by component command.
        2.13.6.2. Perform initial site survey to sites to include, at a minimum but not restricted to:
            2.13.6.2.1. Airfield Suitability Survey.
            2.13.6.2.2. Threat Assessment.
            2.13.6.2.3. Pavement Evaluation.
            2.13.6.2.4. Beddown Assessment.

        (MOBs).
        2.13.7.2. Deploy and execute assigned missions.
        2.13.7.3. During deployment, the AEW determines the capability and sustainability of the site
        and complete checklists for site’s ESP.

2.14. Site Survey Team Training. Education and training are critical to the success of this AFI. All Air
Force personnel will be educated on the expeditionary site survey process. Those who collect the data as
well as those who will use the data to plan operations or make decisions must understand the overall expe-
ditionary site survey process and how to exploit its capabilities to the advantage of the Air Force.
     2.14.1. Personnel assigned to the site survey teams are recognized functional experts. However, while
     each has the ability to view a site from that individual perspective, the team must be able to see the site
     from the operational perspective – the overall organization, since they may or may not know how the
     site will be used. As a result and beyond AFSC or position-specific training, the Air Force must pro-
     vide training courses for the team chief and site survey team. The team chief course is a senior-level
     course addressing the overall process and procedures, lessons learned from past operations, basic
     interaction with foreign governments and military counterparts on behalf of the United States, the
     legal aspects of such situations, and the limitations and authorities of the team chief. The focus of the
     team course will be team synergy – what each member brings to the team as an individual, and
     together, what the team can accomplish through careful planning and interaction.
     2.14.2. All site survey team members, whether assigned to the initial site survey team or follow-on
     team must be formally trained. Air Force leadership and individuals assigned in the planning commu-
     nity must be educated as to what the ESSP is, what the site surveys provide, and how to leverage
     opportunities to assist in expanding the data collection effort while maintaining a high level of accu-
     racy. Ultimately, when fully operational, the ESSP will provide access to an integrated process that is
     capable of addressing those initial operational questions critical to planning air operations.

                                      PLAN DEVELOPMENT

3.1. General. IGESP/ESP development is an ongoing process. The total base resources are identified in
Part I of the plan. Part II development generally follows the JCS planning cycle and publication of sup-
porting plans. The baseline planning data for IGESP/ESP development is (1) COMBATANT COM-
MANDER and supporting OPLANS and CONPLANS, (2) time-phased force deployment data (TPFDDs)
including all-service data, (3) wartime aircraft activity report (WAAR), (4) war reserve materiel (WRM)
authorization documents, and (5) contingency in place requirements.
   3.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) For contingency in-place requirements, functional experts will use Func-
   tional Area Manager Letters, Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS), AEF Reporting
   Tool (ART), Unit Manning Document (UMD), AEF TPFDD Library, and other functional planning
   data necessary to determine mission breakpoints.
   3.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC units will review all taskings to include AEF DW_ posturing,
   In-Place requirements, and capabilities not tied to specific Unit Type Codes (UTCs) affecting overall
   mission accomplishment. Units must compare taskings, capabilities and formally document total mis-
   sion shortfalls and limiting factors within the IGESP Part II. The final IGESP Part II must be signed
   by the respective Wing Commander.
   3.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) For planning purposes, AFSPC units will use their worst-case OPLAN/
   AEFC TPFDD to decide on the appropriate snapshot used for IGESPs.

3.2. Plan Timing. Units are required to update/rewrite IGESP/ESPs in conjunction with TPFDD updates,
when there has been significant change in the unit's support posture, or as directed by the MAJCOM
logistics plans function. As a minimum, the IGESP/ESPs Part I is to be updated annually, but not later
than one year from when it was last published. It is not intended to be updated as changes occur through-
out the year. The IGESP/ESP Part II should be completed no later than 90-days after release of updated
planning documents or as tasked by the MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will baseline the planning cycle by mes-
sage traffic to their units to compensate for the problem of different cycles for source documents. MAJ-
COMs will interface with supported joint commands to interpret other Services’ planned use of AF bases
as reflected in the TPFDD, or where USAF is designated host/executive agent for a location.

3.3. In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC). The IGESPC is the key to successful
expeditionary site planning and must function with senior leadership involvement. The IGESPC shall
meet annually or more often if necessary to maintain a current IGESP.
3.3. (AFSPC) In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC). AFSPC wings will con-
duct an IGESPC at least annually. The date will be determined by each wing.
   3.3.1. Primary members of the IGESPC are all wing staff agency chiefs, group commanders, squad-
   ron commanders, and tenant unit commanders. On installations where a Civilian Personnel Office
   (CPO) is located, the CPO will be on the IGESPC. This individual will ensure civilians are accounted
   for in the IGESP when appropriate, satisfy the need for linkage between IGESPs and Emer-
   gency-Essential, Contingency Essential, and Key personnel designations, and provide overall exper-
   tise in civilian personnel matters.
24                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


     3.3.2. When directed to develop or update a Part II, and upon receipt of initial or updated planning
     data the IGESPC will convene to disseminate information and establish timelines and requirements to
     complete the Part II. The IGESPC will review contingency in-place requirements and other base-level
     plans that describe contingency or wartime requirements and other in-garrison expeditionary site
     planning efforts (e.g., installation deployment plan). Review wartime and other contingency require-
     ments to identify all aircraft, personnel, (including noncombatant evacuees and all services) and
     equipment competing for base resources. Reviews should include (but are not limited to) air base
     operability actions, reception task force responsibilities, command and control structures, facility and
     utility usage, security requirements, noncombatant evacuation planning (including Safe Haven opera-
     tions), and tenant in-garrison expeditionary site planning involvement. The IGESPC should consider
     recommended changes and inputs received from transiting and/or employing units for possible incor-
     poration into the IGESP to include tenant unit requirements. De-conflict requirements for competing
     resources. Validate and prioritize installation LIMFACs that affect force deployment, reception,
     employment, and overall mission accomplishment.
        3.3.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) When in receipt of new planning documents, AFSPC units through the
        IGESPC must assess the in-place mission with all respective taskings and determine an IGESP
        Part 2. The IGESPC must coordinate and document reviews of the unit’s ability to perform the
        in-place mission under wartime conditions. The documented review must be certified by the wing/
        installation commander. If the documented review reveals an IGESP Part 2 is not necessary – post
        the certified letter IAW paragraph 1.6. The OPRs to coordinate the IGESPC reviews, IGESP Part
        1 and 2s are listed at Table 2.1. (Added)
        3.3.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC units will report limiting factors of any capabilities affecting
        the overall in-place mission through an IGESP Part 2. Currently, IGESP Part 2 reporting is man-
        datory for Peterson and Patrick AFBs.
     3.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC organizations attached as tenant units are not responsible for writing
     an IGESP/ESP, however, they must ensure they are included in the host IGESPC process. If the tenant
     unit submits input into the host IGESP, ensure that input is sent to HQ AFSPC/A4RDX.

3.4. Planning Conference/Site Survey. Ideally IGESP/ESPs are produced at the point of intended use by
the units expected to use them. A combined planning conference/site survey held at the employment loca-
tion with the lead wing and NAF participating is optimum for locations without permanently assigned
major air force units. This concept also works well at locations where there is a host Air Force unit, and
they expect significant incoming forces. A planning conference at the host unit location can bring together
like-functional representatives from the host and the major incoming units to facilitate resource alloca-
tion.

3.5. Plan Titles. ESPs and IGESPs have standardized titles. The title includes the base/site name and
location, and " IGESP 10-404-XX” with XX representing the year the IGESP or ESP is published. Exam-
ples:
        KUNSAN AB, ROK                                 AL UDEID AB, QATAR
        IGESP 10-404-00                                ESP 10-404-01

3.6. Security Classification. IGESP/ESP Part I is normally unclassified and marked "For Official Use
Only." IGESP/ESP Part II is normally classified based on the OPLANS they support – classify Part II
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                             25


according to derivative classification guidance. The IGESP and ESP may have separate unclassified and
classified sections, as well as restricted distribution of some sections, to allow the widest appropriate dis-
tribution. As a minimum, mark the plan "For Official Use Only."

3.7. Plan Approval. The wing/installation commander is usually the approval authority for the IGESP
and ESP and must sign the plan, any subsequent changes or updates, and the LIMFAC report. The respon-
sible MAJCOM in coordination with the appropriate NAF will determine approval authority in cases
where the wing/installation commander cannot be the approval authority; i.e., lead wing commander or
air force component commander can approve an IGESP or ESP for a site. The information contained
within the IGESP Part I, will be treated as FOUO and NOFRN. The commander’s approval of an elec-
tronic generated IGESP from the EKB will be documented in the miscellaneous folder, within the General
Site Information Section.
   3.7.1. (Added-AFSPC) IGESP/ESP approvals are delegated to the wing/installation commander.
   ESP approval requires coordination and approval of the lead wing or Air Force Component Com-
   mander.

3.8. Plan Distribution. Once IGESPs and ESPs are approved, the publishing function (usually wing or
NAF logistics plans function) will generate a message to the MAJCOM and NAF logistics plans function,
and each major deploying unit notifying them of plan availability. Post the plan to the EKB, or when this
is not possible to a MAJCOM logistics plans function GCCS/SIPRNET WEB page. Air National Guard
and Air Force Reserve units should forward one copy of the IGESP to ANGRC/LGX or AFRC/LGX in
addition to any MAJCOM requirements. Specific benefits derived from good distribution and availability
of the IGESP/ESP include (1) in-depth review and consistent development of requirements; (2) tailored
deployment packages that eliminate duplication of resources available at the beddown location; and (3) a
common core of knowledge on planned reception actions to provide a smooth and rapid integration of
incoming forces. When appropriate, ensure the U.S. host nation representative has the opportunity view
the IGESP/ESP. Be sure to coordinate this release with the appropriate Plans and Programs office prior to
release.
3.8. (AFSPC) Plan Distribution. Contact AFSPC/A4RDX upon completion of the IGESP Part 1 and 2.
Ensure the EKB is uploaded NLT 30 days from completion.
   3.8.1. Upon receipt of draft, new or updated IGESP/ESPs, deploying units should accomplish a plan
   review and provide recommended changes and comments back to the IGESP/ESP OPR. Direct corre-
   spondence between deploying and reception units is encouraged; with courtesy copies of message
   traffic to the respective MAJCOM and NAF logistics plans agencies as applicable.

                                    PLAN CONTENT GUIDANCE

4.1. Format. IGESP/ESPs currently use a two-part format. Part I outlines base/installation capabilities
and total resources. As a minimum, MAJCOMs will ensure units capture STEP blue field (BCAT) data
elements in EKB Part I. MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring the complete in-garrison ESP is accessi-
ble via the World Wide Web or AF Portal and is available to AF and sister service functionals. Part II
depicts contingency requirements and allocates resources identified in Part I, assesses the ability to sup-
port the operation, and identifies limiting factors (LIMFACs). Until such time, units that cannot access the
STEP application should follow the format outlined in the attachments as much as possible. Deviations
are authorized where the information in the attachment does not apply. The process should result in a plan
with the complete range of information necessary to identify wartime requirements and procedures, and
the resources necessary to fulfill the requirements. In general, content should be detailed enough for a
newly assigned individual to understand what must be done and how to do it. This is especially true for
IGESP/ESPs in short tour areas and at bases without a major Air Force presence during peacetime.
4.1. (AFSPC) Format. AFSPC wing IGESP OPRs will post their data to the EKB. All AFSPC IGESPs
will be updated in the EKB within 120 days of receipt of their LOGCAT User-ID/Password.

4.2. Non-Air Force Support. Use applicable functional chapter to incorporate requirements for planned
Army, Navy, or Marine Corps unit beddown, or transit support. Completed SORs should be incorporated
in the functional chapters of the plan (Part II).

4.3. Specific Content Guidance. The functional chapter titles in STEP are the same as Attachment 1
through Attachment 44; however, data entry fields within the STEP chapters differ in some cases from
the narrative in the attachments. When necessary, the “notes” area in all STEP chapters can be used to
include any information not covered by a data entry field. Units are encouraged to develop operating
instructions, checklists, and other supporting documentation to aid in plan development and execution
and to address unique situations. When a Part II is required, a lead-in paragraph should establish why it is
being developed, i.e., for what OPLAN or contingency. Tenant unit equipment and resources should be
incorporated in the appropriate section of the plan (Parts I and II)
4.3. (AFSPC) Specific Content Guidance. Initial Part 2s will be posted to the EKB using the appropri-
ate STEP module 120 days after receipt of LOGCAT system User-ID/Password. Thereafter, Part 2
updates will be made IAW paragraph 3.2.
     4.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC units will have access to the LOGCAT unclassified and classified
     systems. The classified LOGCAT is the repository for all IGESP Part 2s, classified site surveys, and
     provides commanders information about worldwide locations.
     4.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) The same unclassified LOGCAT username and password are used to access
     the EKB at website: https://ekb.mont.disa.mil/step/

4.4. The Expeditionary Site Survey Process is a subset of the ESP process. It is composed of three pri-
mary interactive sub processes. As shown in Figure 4.1., these are site selection, data collection, and stor-
age and access. Although inter-related, each sub process has its own distinct purpose.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                              27


Figure 4.1. Overview – ESSP Process.




   4.4.1. Sub-Process 1: Site Selection. Site selection consists of two, interrelated processes based on
   when a site is identified as a potential operating location. Air Force component command staffs will
   work with Combatant Commanders and Air Mobility Command planners to assess operating loca-
   tions in support of the Combatant Commander planning directives such as the theater engagement
   plan. A site may be one of several identified and prioritized on a list by the component command,
   IAW its site selection criteria, in the pre-conflict period. It can also be identified as part of the course
   of action (COA) development phase during crisis action planning. It is incumbent upon the compo-
   nent command to actively seek opportunities to conduct site surveys in a deliberate planning mode.
   This process of early engagement will facilitate the planning and execution process as well as facili-
   tate relationships with country teams in those locations not routinely visited by air force personnel.
   4.4.2. Sub-process 2: Data collection. The data collection sub-process is the heart of the site survey
   process. It is composed of three distinct components - pre-site survey, site survey, and post site survey
   as illustrated in Figure 4.2. The pre-site survey consists of actions taken by the team before departing
   home station for the site. Functional experts perform pre-site survey tasks such as research the
   selected site via the Non-Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) or Secret Internet Pro-
   tocol Router Network (SIPRNET) or obtain prior surveys, and expeditionary site plans if available,
   obtain common installation picture and other maps and imagery of the location, and contact the Air
   Force component command and Combatant Command country teams for information and assistance
   as necessary. The site survey, which consists of actions accomplished while the team is deployed to
   the location. When notified, the site team deploys to a location to conduct the site survey. During the
   site survey the team obtains site-specific physical characteristics and site capability data. Additionally,
   the teams may be required to make basic assessments regarding the site’s suitability for flight opera-
28                                                                 AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


     tions in support of any Air Force mission. The standardized checklist will guide the site survey teams
     and planners to perform an operational assessment of a site. Information collected during the site visit
     is stored and subsequently analyzed to generate four primary products for use by planners during the
     post-site survey phase--airfield suitability assessment, full spectrum threat assessment, pavement
     evaluation, and an initial beddown assessment. The post-site survey phase consists of actions taken
     by the team after departing the survey location. During this phase actions would include updating an
     integrated framework and further development of an integrated CIP using ESM capabilities. Teams
     may be required to generate written reports as necessary to meet theater requirements. In-depth feasi-
     bility assessments may be accomplished during the post-site survey timeframe to ascertain the most
     effective mission type for the site. Analysis and information generated by an assigned mission by
     functional experts determine the long-term capability of a site’s supportability. This analysis identifies
     what additional items and personnel are required to execute and sustain a mission, i.e. the generation
     of in-to-plane contracts for fuel support or the development of an acquisition cross-servicing agree-
     ment with the host-nation.

Figure 4.2. Data collection Sub-Process.




Determining that an airfield is capable of supporting flight operations is paramount to successful accom-
plishment of a site survey. Appropriate MAJCOM Director of Operations staff will perform an assess-
ment on the Site Survey Team’s Airfield Suitability Survey data and approve or disapprove the site for
their MAJCOM specific air operations. The assessment procedure (Figure 4.3.) is typical across the
MAJCOMs and addresses all Air Force aircraft and the full spectrum of operational missions. Decisions
for potential use will be made available to the warfighter with notes on which specific aircraft can operate
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                            29


from the FOL, limitations, and other appropriate comments. Additionally, decisions not to use the site for
future operations based on the airfield suitability assessment will be identified.

Figure 4.3. Airfield Suitability Assessment.




   4.4.3. Sub-Process 3: Storage And Access. Data Storage and Access: Storage of data, and access to
   the data, by authorized personnel is paramount to advancing the site survey process. Data collected by
   the site survey teams must be managed in a fashion that allows data sharing opportunities, provides
   methods for easy yet secure access, and rapid analysis. The methodology for building data communi-
   cations or information technology (IT) systems is well defined by the DOD and the Air Force. The
   DOD and the Air Force have established direction in the form of policies, guidance, and standards for
   the acquisition and implementation of IT systems. All IT systems are designed on a specific architec-
   ture that includes an Integrated Framework. The Integrated Framework is comprised of layers; Tech
   Services, Integration Services, and Infrastructure. The Tech Services layer is the only layer of the inte-
   grated framework that most customers of site survey data will reference. The components of the Tech
   Services layer provide the storage of, and access to data. The Web Services component will provide
   web pages with integrated applications allowing users to search (query) databases for site information
   and then deliver the results of the search in predefined reports or user-defined (ad-hoc) reports. Links
   to archives and archive search engines will also provide users with information not typically stored in
   databases (e.g., after-action and lessons-learned reports). The goal of the Web Services component is
   to become the one-stop shopping point, or Web broker, of site survey data. Other components of the
   Tech Services layer address, security, load balancing of customers accessing Web Services, and data-
30                                                           AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


     bases. The ESSP Program Manager must continuously search for opportunities to enhance data man-
     agement by seeking out and collaborating with Program Managers of systems that store site
     information. Data sharing between databases must be examined and established to minimize duplica-
     tion of data stores and collection efforts.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                            31

                                CONTINGENCY/ESSP SITE SURVEY

5.1. General. AFI 10-503, Base Unit Beddown Procedures, implements AFPD 10-5, Basing, and pro-
vides guidance for conducting site surveys for permanent beddown of a unit or mission on real property.
It is not applicable to site surveys for determining locations to support survival recovery and reconstitu-
tion plans, exercises, and contingencies. This AFI sets policy for conducting these types of site surveys
that are collectively termed contingency site surveys. In the context of expeditionary site planning, a site
survey is defined as the physical investigation of a location to gather data in support of a planned or pos-
sible contingency operation. Site surveys are conducted for any or all of the following purposes: (1) To
determine the feasibility of a location for planned operations; (2) To validate information about equip-
ment, terrain, host nation resources, and infrastructure such as serviceability, availability, compatibility,
etc. (3) To gather critical information for future operations and facilitate planning for the eventual use of
a location.

5.2. Concept. Site surveys are an integral part of the expeditionary site planning process. Information
gathered during a survey on a site’s resources and capabilities are captured in the ESP Part I, and an anal-
ysis of the information facilitates resource allocation in Part II of the plan.
   5.2.1. Site surveys are accomplished during deliberate and crisis action planning. In both circum-
   stances enough information must be collected to avoid the need for repeat visits. The survey tool for
   employment planning (STEP) is designed to capture site information by functional category. STEP
   has two modes or electronic checklists for gathering data – a full detailed checklist designed for fully
   staffed survey teams with adequate time for a complete survey (deliberate planning), and a shortened
   quick reaction site survey (QRSS) checklist for smaller survey teams supporting crisis action plan-
   ning. Site survey data collected with STEP is stored on the Employment Knowledge Base (EKB) as
   an ESP Part I enabling planners worldwide access to the data for beddown planning, assessment, and
   familiarization. The Integrated Expeditionary Site Survey Checklists (IESSC) may be used to collect
   site survey data when STEP is not available or impractical to use. The checklists should reflect the
   same data entry points in STEP or a similar capability to facilitate loading the data in STEP after the
   fact, and subsequent storage on the EKB. The STEP QRSS checklist and IESSC are available from the
   Command logistics plans function.
   5.2.2. In addition to known operating locations identified in contingency plans, site surveys should be
   conducted at other possible beddown sites to better prepare air expeditionary forces for operations in
   unfamiliar and austere locations. MAJCOMs and NAFs in a component role should identify locations
   within their AOR as the most likely candidates for conducting contingency operations to include
   humanitarian relief operations. Locations should be determined from theater engagement plans, Com-
   batant Commander’s staff inputs, intelligence information, etc. and prioritized for accomplishing
   actual site surveys. The process of identifying possible beddown sites and surveying them is an ongo-
   ing effort. The list of locations must be continuously reviewed and new locations surveyed as chang-
   ing world conditions drive new requirements.

5.3. Authorization. The MAJCOM logistics plans function or designated organization, provides over-
sight for all site surveys in their AOR. Permission to conduct site surveys must be granted by this central
MAJCOM authority prior to the actual visit. This process minimizes duplication of effort (multiple visits
32                                                             AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


to the same location), facilitates proper storage of critical information (ESP update and EKB upload), and
ensures surveys are accomplished in priority order. Units conducting site surveys outside of their AOR
should request permission through their own MAJCOM logistics plans function or designated organiza-
tion.

5.4. Site Survey Team. The mission dictates site survey team member selection. Every effort should be
made to include functional area subject matter experts (SME) of sufficient experience and rank from the
lead wing or major deploying units expected to operate at the location. Site survey team members using
STEP must be trained on the application. Figure 5.1. provides a suggested site survey team composition;
however, the mission and purpose of the site survey will determine the team size, composition, rank struc-
ture, specific experience required in each functional area, etc. When multiple MAJCOMs have opera-
tional responsibility at the same location they each may be granted permission to field a site survey team
(i.e., the same location has both AMC throughput mission and ACC aircraft beddown missions), but team
size should be limited to the maximum extent possible and cross utilization of personnel is encouraged.

5.5. ESSP Integrated Site Survey Team Composition. The ESSP is composed of two types of teams – a
dedicated initial site survey team and the follow-on team. The differences between the two teams are their
focus and products. Future site survey teams will have defined roles, an established team composition,
and a defined product thus eliminating any confusion on what is expected of the teams. The initial site sur-
vey team will be capable of producing the minimum essential data required on a site: the threat assess-
ment, the airfield suitability survey, the pavements evaluation, and the beddown assessment. The
follow-on team however, will be mission specific and will focus on the data that are pertinent to the suc-
cess of the given operation. These teams will be groups of highly trained individuals who have a working
knowledge of the process and the deliverables. Tools will be used that will expedite their efforts, and pri-
oritized actions will ensure time onsite is optimized. Site survey teams will provide planners and leaders
with decision-quality information.
   5.5.1. Initial Site Survey Team (ISST). The cadre of personnel trained and capable of producing the
   following products. Although the ISST is limited to specific functional areas it by no way implies that
   other functional areas do not facilitate the site survey process. Team limitations are a result of scope,
   time, and country restrictions. If the scope of site survey exceeds the capability of the ISST, MAJ-
   COMs and component commands should make accommodations to the team composition but not to
   the detriment of producing the aforementioned ISST products. These automated reports will be avail-
   able in a future release of LOGCAT.
       5.5.1.1. Full Spectrum Threat Assessment – Security Forces, Preventative Medicine, Civil Engi-
       neering Readiness and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI).
       5.5.1.2. Airfield Suitability Survey – Airfield Operations (certified Airfield Manager plus 1).
       5.5.1.3. Pavements Evaluation – Civil Engineering.
       5.5.1.4. ECS Beddown Assessment – Civil Engineering, Contracting, Fuels, Munitions (SEI 375
       qualified), Communications, Combat Plans, Medical.
   5.5.2. The Follow-on Team. The follow-on team should conduct detailed analysis of the information
   available on the site/country and what additional information is required to successfully execute the
   anticipated assigned mission. This team may consist of functional experts from the Open the Base
   Force Module and typically either the component command, Contingency Response Unit (CRU), and
   air expeditionary group/wing and associate units or a combination of all of the above. The focus of
   this team is methodical data collection as it pertains to a specific mission and that site. To do this, the
   team will determine the access and availability of host nation resources, capability of the site and host
   nation ability to sustain operations, identify shortfalls/limiting factors (LIMFACS) and potential
   workarounds for each, and develop a site beddown plan. The follow-on team is required to produce
   the final ESP.
   5.5.3. Role of Team Chief (Responsibilities and Duties). The Team Chief is the senior Air Force per-
   son on any site survey team and is responsible for the success of the survey and will certify any data
   collected by his/her team. This person must be capable of interacting with high-ranking officials of
   other services and nations. The team chief must have the capability and authority to make high-level
   decisions. This individual should understand Air Force operational capabilities as well as logistical
   implications of bedding down various Air Force forces. The team chief should have an extensive
   working knowledge of the various key functional areas and their minimum needs to beddown forces.
   The team chief is responsible for several key functions within the site survey process. Duties of the
   team chief include, but are not limited to those identified in Figure 5.2.

Terms
Aerial Port —An airfield that has been designated for the sustained air movement of personnel and
materiel as well as an authorized port for entrance into or departure from the country where located.
Agile Combat Support (ACS)—A core competency of the Air Force that includes the processes that
create, sustain and protect all air and space capabilities necessary to accomplish mission objectives across
the spectrum of conflict. It is the product of processes that ready the force, prepare the battle space,
position the force, employ, sustain, and recover the force.
Air Terminal —A facility on an airfield that functions as an air transportation hub and accommodates the
loading and unloading of airlift aircraft and intransit processing of traffic. The airfield may or may not be
designated an aerial port.
Combatant Commander—A commander of one of the unified or specified combatant commands
established by the President. Also called CDR. See also combatant command; specified combatant
command; unified combatant command. (Approved by JMTGM # 076-2864-94)
Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS)—The tailored ACS capability deployed to expeditionary sites
to provide for air and space forces employed and engaged in operations. This capability is produced by
rapidly deployable, tailored forces executing ACS processes to beddown, employ, maintain, protect and
redeploy tactical components of air and space power and production.
Employment Knowledge Base (EKB) —LOGCAT database that stores all STEP Agency (NIMA)
airfield data, and other information critical to contingency beddown planning.
Expeditionary Site Plans (ESP)—ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a permanent Air
Force presence and may contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial beddown decisions.
ESPs may be developed in short time frames to meet contingency needs without full staffing or
coordination. It is the installation level or site plan to support unified and specified command wartime
operations plans, as well as MAJCOM supporting plans. It cuts across all functional support areas in a
consolidated view of installation missions, requirements, capabilities, and limitations to plan for actions
and resources supporting war or contingency operations, including deployment, post-deployment, and
employment activities (as appropriate).
Garrison GeoBase—Provides one installation map delivering current situational awareness in a secure
fashion via the base network.
GeoBase—An Air Force initiative to “attain, maintain, and sustain one geospatial infrastructure
supporting all installation requirements.” GeoBase consists of a suite of three dimensions used for various
functions. They are as follows:
GeoReach and Expeditionary Basing—Provides a Common Installation Picture (CIP) using
information acquired from intelligence sources and assists with various planning aspects such as aircraft
parking, munitions storage, and other beddown force requirements.
In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP) —Primarily developed for locations with a permanent
Air Force presence, and are fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many functional
experts with a deliberate planning time line. Replaces the former term Base Support Plan (BSP). All plans
formerly called BSPs will be redesignated IGESPs. The term IGESP describes all plans developed to
44                                                                 AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


meet deliberate planning requirements, contingency planning requirements, and any other site planning
requirements. While the term BSP is superseded; the requirement for robust, structured, and standardized
site planning based on AFI 10-404 remain.
In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC) —A planning body appointed by the
installation commander to facilitate the development of the (normally comprised of senior level
leadership). The IGESPC serves as the focal point for plan development and reports to the commander on
the status of plans. It integrates the numerous base-level requirements and functional support actions to
present a coordinated overview of activity in the. This committee was formerly known as the Base
Support Planning Committee (BSPC).
Level of Survey:—
Suitability —Tests the ability of the site to meet basic requirements.
Feasibility —Tests the ability of the site to be adapted to use.
Capability —Tests the ability of the site to support a specified mission or deployment.
Sustainability —Tests the ability of the site to support a specified mission for an undetermined period of
time.

Limiting Factor. —A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently, impedes mission
accomplishment. (Joint Pub 1-02) {Has a critical negative impact on the ability of a unit to perform its
wartime mission, and require the aid of higher headquarters to resolve.}Used in this publication for
clarity.
Logistician’s Contingency Assessment Tools (LOGCAT)—A NIPRNET/SIPRNET-based suite of
standard systems tools that enables automated, employment-driven, agile combat support planning.
LOGCAT supports the and expeditionary site planning process by accurately and rapidly identifying
resources and combat support requirements at potential employment locations, providing beddown
capability analysis and LIMFAC identification, and facilitating force tailoring decisions to reduce the
overall deployment footprint. LOGCAT consists of three components that are mandated for use when they
are available at all levels of command.
MAJCOM Combat Plans Function —Provides command policy and guidance for implementing and
expeditionary site planning concepts to meet their specific missions.
Site Survey—The physical investigation of a location to gather data in support of a planned or possible
contingency operation. Site surveys are conducted for any or all of the following purposes: (1) To
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                           45


determine the feasibility of a location for planned operations; (2) To validate information about
equipment, terrain, host nation resources, and infrastructure such as serviceability, availability,
compatibility, etc. (3) To gather critical information for future operations and facilitate planning for the
eventual use of a location.
Strategic GeoBase—Looks at broader geospatial imagery to understand the proximity of cities,
geographical landmarks, and other areas of interest. This information is used in collaboration with the
more specific GeoBase garrison data to gain a more complete picture of the operating location.
Supported Command —The command having primary responsibility for an operation under an OPLAN
or contingency. (Definition used for this pub only)
Supporting Command —A command providing augmentation forces or other support to another
(supported) command. (Definition used for this pub only)
Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP) —Partially automates the overall and expeditionary
site planning process and standardizes /ESP products via a sophisticated, multimedia tool for the
collection of base/site data. STEP is designed for in-garrison or deployed configurations, and incorporates
functionally based checklists to methodically capture data during site surveys. STEP organizes the data in
a standard format to facilitate beddown analysis and LIMFAC identification. STEP enables or ESP
development with separate Part I and Part II modules.
Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) —The computer-supported data base portion of
an operation plan; it contains time-phased force data, non-unit-related cargo and personnel data, and
movement data for the operation plan.
Wartime Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR) —Extracts of the USAF War and Mobilization Plan,
Volume 4 (WMP-4), Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) that lists the aircraft activities of approved war
plans for a specified airfield or assault strip.

                                        CHAPTER 6 - RECEPTION


PART 1:

6.1. Concept of operations. Provide an overview of the overall perspective and goals of the installation
reception process. The purpose is to effectively and efficiently receive incoming forces by ensuring arriv-
ing personnel are provided immediate protection from the effects of enemy attack, adequate living and
working facilities; and arranging for the expeditious movement of arriving equipment to unit work areas.
Reception begins at the POD. Theater reception is the process of receiving personnel and materiel in the
theater. It establishes the in-theater accountability, and initial sorting of units, unit equipment, personnel,
and materiel. Staging occurs when unit personnel are married with their equipment in a controlled area.
Theater sustainment materiel is segregated, prioritized, and prepared for transport to the required loca-
tions. Onward movement is the coordinated actions of allocating road space, transportation assets (air,
ground, inland, and rail) and support requirements for the unit and/or materiel. Additionally, vehicle allo-
cations need to be accomplished in an orderly fashion.

6.2. Provide a simple summary of the reception flow for equipment, personnel, and weapon systems. This
should be clear enough that personnel arriving could use the summary to understand what to do upon
arrival at a base through actual beddown.

     6.2.1. Describe the personnel reception process from the point that personnel arrive at the base
     through their arrival at temporary quarters. Ideally units are met by like host units, i.e. an inbound civil
     engineer team would be met by someone from the civil engineer squadron. Describe the modifications
     to the process (if any) that occur should the installation come under attack and/or become CB contam-
     inated during reception activities.

     6.2.2. Describe the process by which cargo (uncontaminated and contaminated) for arriving units is
     received and moved to the appropriate location on base. This process should include a method for
     inbound unit equipment custodians to travel with the cargo and then be processed through the recep-
     tion line when their equipment is properly stored in the beddown work area. Units may include the
     handling procedures for contaminated cargo in this chapter or provide appropriate references to the
     NBCC annex.

6.3. Identify reception facilities or areas that will be used for personnel and cargo reception. Include facil-
ity capacities, phone numbers and other communications capabilities. A drawing of the facility with flow
path is often useful to incoming unit commanders. Include the location(s) of the nearest protective struc-
tures if the reception point does not provide adequate protection for personnel in the event of an enemy
attack.

6.4. Specify functional area procedures and responsibilities.

     6.4.1. Personnel in-processing procedures.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                             53


   6.4.2. Finance support.

   6.4.3. Chaplain support including publication of religious service schedules.

   6.4.4. Legal and medical support on the in-processing line.

   6.4.5. Services support including availability of box lunches during in-processing and beddown activ-
   ities, availability of dining facilities, lodging etc.

   6.4.6. Transportation support for the reception of personnel and cargo, including a local driving orien-
   tation for inbound personnel.

   6.4.7. Postal support including advising individuals and units on procedures for receiving mail.

   6.4.8. Additional support that may be required from security forces, Red Cross, state/local govern-
   ment representation, or others.

   6.4.9. Interface with arrival/departure airfield control groups, Tanker Airlift Control Elements, and
   deployment control centers.

   6.4.10. Weapons safety and munitions control office support for reception of explosives, and storage
   of explosives in accordance with explosives site plans.

   6.4.11. Additional NBCC defense measures

major deploying units during Part II planning conferences/site surveys. Use of standard civil engineering
Global Information System (GIS) mapping programs is encouraged for developing aircraft parking plan
maps. See Attachment 45 for specific guidance.

PART 1: IS NOT DEVELOPED FOR THIS CHAPTER

PART 2:

8.1. The airfield loading/parking plan is crucial to managing the physical flow of aircraft through the base,
especially when airlift and tactical operations occur concurrently. Maintaining a smooth and orderly flow
is important to the expeditious turnaround of airlift assets and minimizing exposure of aircraft and person-
nel to possible enemy action. Depict all aircraft including in-place, transient, and incoming aircraft
regardless of origin. This information is used to identify peak load periods for the base during contin-
gency operations and facilitates effective evaluation of support capability and requirements.

8.2. Use the WAA to depict consecutive airfield loading by MDS and MOG. The following format is sug-
gested:



                          MOG MOG MOG MOG MOG MOG MOG MOG
 DAY MDS UNIT              1-5     6-10    11-15 16-20 21-25 26-30 31-60 61-90 REMARKS


8.3. Use the WAA to identify planned sorties in five day increments by MDS and gallons per sortie. A
breakout of in-place and augmentation aircraft is recommended along with reference to the WAAR line
for each aircraft type. The following format is suggested:



    ACFT       GALS
    TYPE  WAAR PER
I/P   AUG LINE SORTIE 1-5 6-10 11-15                     16-20    21-25    26-30    31-60    61-90 RMKS


8.4. Describe the aircraft-parking plan for the primary war mission of the base. Use the Contingency Air-
field Parking Planner (CAPP) available on-line at www.pcase.com. Normally, the completed plan is clas-
sified. Include all employing and transient combat and cargo aircraft. Identify loading / unloading spots
and hot pit refueling areas; ensure all explosives loading, unloading, parking areas are sited and a risk
assessment performed and commander is briefed on the risk. Depict specific use of all shelters, revet-
56                                                                  AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


ments, hardstands, and ramp areas by planned aircraft. Highlight the situation if space in aircraft shelters
exceeds aircraft assets, and ensure these extra shelters are utilized for critical asset protection (fuel trucks,
bomb jammers, etc.). Portray emergency parking areas such as taxiways, secondary runways, airfield
matting, commercial facilities, and current host parking areas, as these areas may require use during sur-
vivability actions. Coordinate the plan with operations, security forces, civil engineers, maintenance, fire
department, fuels, communications, and safety. See Attachment 44 for specific guidance.

                               OPERATIONS


Note: Use applicable DoD and Air Force instructions for developing information for this chapter.

PART 1:

9.1. Summarize the plan to handle and process US citizens and designated foreign nationals for NEO and
Safe Haven operations, to include operations in a NBCC environment if the threat exists. Define the scope
of required actions by indicating specific activities (e.g., identification, marshaling, evacuation) applica-
ble to the plan. Although the personnel community is responsible for preparing this portion of the IGESP/
ESP (which includes both establishment and implementation of procedures during actual operations),
numerous other agencies play important roles and their responsibilities cannot be overlooked. Thus, logis-
tics plans, services, security forces, OSI, comptroller, public affairs, transportation, CE Readiness NBC
personnel, etc., are OCRs in the development of NEO planning and should provide the personnel office
with operational procedures pertaining to their specific functions (e.g., Services will plan lodging require-
ments, and Transportation will identify airlift/sealift evacuation procedures, etc.).

PART 2:

9.2. Identify any contingency-specific requirements, operating procedures, or limitations. The plan will
address the following areas, as a minimum, if the possibility of these operations taking place in a NBCC
environment exists.

10.2. Identify the concept of operations. Identify the organizational relationship and reporting require-
ments of all operations units.

10.3. Identify existing capabilities (facilities, briefing rooms, communication modes, vehicles, weather
data, etc.).

PART 2:

10.4. Identify the mission(s) and concept of operations for all flying operations. Include emergency
response procedures for aircrew members when they and their aircraft are caught outside the parking area
during an enemy attack i.e., launch for survival, return to parking area, pull over to side of taxiway or into
nearest revetment, etc.

10.5. Summarize organizational command and control relationships existing under OPLAN execution.

10.6. Identify reporting requirements for all operations units.

10.7. List assumptions that may impact the ability to support the wing mission during OPLAN execution.

10.8. Identify procedures for life support, aerial delivery, tactics, initial generation and launch, etc.

10.9. Identify rules of engagement.

10.10. Include any other requirements to support the wing flying operations, such as weather. Ensure the-
ater orientation briefings are prepared for incoming forces.

10.11. Consider if current unit facility(s) is adequate for the additional personnel arriving and indicate any
additional requirements. If a CB threat exists, include an assessment of the aircrew contamination control
area processing rate into the facility(s) as part of this evaluation.

10.12. Specify additional communication needs, including radios, frequencies, and telephones.

10.13. Compute additional vehicle requirements considering on-hand vehicle fleet, as well as any WRM
vehicles assigned to your unit(s). Provide requirements to the transportation function by vehicle type,
number currently authorized for peacetime operation, number currently assigned, and number required to
support OPLAN requirements.

                                 OPERATIONS


PART 1: IS NOT DEVELOPED FOR THIS CHAPTER

PART 2:

11.1. Introduction. As principle advisors to the commander on NBCC issues, the readiness personnel
should be able to address all aspects of NBCC defense. Make plans to improve or develop alternatives for
deficiencies. If the unit is counting on host nation resources, ensure written support agreements exist.

11.2. NBC Detection and Warning. The unit’s integrated NBC detection network should detect all of the
enemy’s CB agents, in all of the likely agent delivery forms (liquid, dusty, aerosol). If not, develop a
method that will/can be used for agent identification.

11.3. Threat. Determine the threat.

   11.3.1. What is the actual threat at the location as agreed upon by the Readiness Flight, Security
   Forces, OSI, and Intelligence? Use all available documents and specific discussions with intelligence
   personnel during this evaluation.

   11.3.2. What is the likelihood of enemy use of:

       11.3.2.1. Nuclear, chemical, or biological agents?

       11.3.2.2. Conventional weapons, terrorism, and special operations forces?

   11.3.3. If NBCC weapons are likely to be used:

       11.3.3.1. How are the agents likely to be delivered?

       11.3.3.2. How many weapon systems will probably be used in any given attack?

       11.3.3.3. What is the range, payload, accuracy, and likely burst characteristics (air, ground) of the
       weapon system(s)?

       11.3.3.4. What specific agents are likely to be used?

       11.3.3.5. What is the expected physical form (liquid, dusty, aerosol) of the agents?

       11.3.3.6. When is the enemy likely to employ NBCC weapons (i.e., in the early stages, during
       nighttime, etc.)?
60                                                                 AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


        11.3.3.7. What contamination levels (g/m2, mg/m3, spores/m3, etc.) are expected to exist at your
        location after an attack?

        11.3.3.8. What is the purity of the enemy’s agents:

            11.3.3.8.1. Is there a shelf-life associated with their agent production (i.e., the agent(s) must be
            used within six months of production in order to be effective)?

            11.3.3.8.2. Are the characteristics of their agent the same as an American-made agent (i.e.,
            does the enemy’s VX have the same volatility rate, color change on M8 paper, etc.)?

     11.3.4. What are the expected conventional weapons delivery systems (i.e., mortars, rockets, sur-
     face-to-surface missiles, and man portable surface-to-air missiles)?

     11.3.5. What is the “hazard ring” associated with critical operating locations of the installation (to
     include typical aircraft take off and landing patterns)? This “ring” provides insight into the amount of
     area around the installation that must be secured from ground forces - the installation’s perimeter
     fence has no tactical significance. Develop the hazard ring by drawing a line equaling threat weapon
     system ranges from the critical airfield operating locations. In most cases, the “ring” will actually take
     the shape of a large dog bone.

     11.3.6. If a realistic threat, what is the range and accuracy of enemy sniper activities?

11.4. NBC Assessments. The unit should possess the training and support materials necessary to provide
detailed assessments for commanders concerning NBC agent identification, characteristics, associated
hazards, and persistency? If necessary in relation to the threat, does the unit have a realistic chance (equip-
ment, training, and past exercise performance) of sustaining mission operations in a NBC contaminated
environment for an extended time?

     11.4.1. “Hazard Ring”. Air base defense, sister service, and/or host nation forces should have control
     throughout the employment location’s “hazard ring”, especially in terms of man-portable sur-
     face-to-air systems?

11.5. NBC Equipment. The unit should possess plans for the protection and distribution of CB individual
protective equipment (IPE).

     11.5.1. Are all personnel familiar with the plans?

     11.5.2. Does the unit possess sufficient IPE to conduct operations in an extended NBC contaminated
     environment? This includes IPE for critical host nation and/or sister service personnel such as air
     defense, security forces, and cargo handlers.

     11.5.3. Is a clear resupply route for IPE established and are sufficient resources available through this
     method?
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                            61


11.6. NBC Detection.

   11.6.1. The unit’s integrated NBC detection network should be positioned in such a manner that per-
   sonnel will receive sufficient warning to completely avoid agent exposure.

       11.6.1.1. If this is not possible, what specific types and concentrations of CB agents will personnel
       likely be exposed to before they receive warning?

       11.6.1.2. Will this exposure be sufficient to cause injuries and/or fatalities? If so, what percentage
       of personnel are expected to be incapacitated or killed?

       11.6.1.3. Does the unit possess the capability to provide virtually instantaneous warning and criti-
       cal amplification instructions to the entire base populace?

   11.6.2. Is the base divided into sectors to provide contamination control post-attack?

11.7. NBCC Response. All Readiness personnel employed are expected to be familiar with existing pro-
cedures and aware of their specific mission task(s), regardless of their originating home station. Installa-
tion response procedures should be such that the wing does not respond to all threats (sniper, ground
forces, mortars, missile and/or aircraft attacks) in the same manner. This will cause unnecessary degrada-
tion and possibly prevent the unit from accomplishing its assigned mission(s).

   11.7.1. Does the unit possess “cookie cutter” (one-size fits all) procedures such as automatic evacua-
   tion distances in relation to unexploded ordnance (same for bomblet as for missile regardless of facil-
   ity structure or mission criticality)? If so, examine these procedures and determine the potential
   impact they will have on mission operations.

                                              FOOD SERVICE


PART ONE:

15.1. Indicate how food service can support 4 meals a day. Identify all food service activities and capaci-
ties (meals per period.) Also identify the seating capacity for each activity.

15.2. Emergency Capacity Computation.

     15.2.1. Determine the number of seats available in each appropriated food service facility.

     15.2.2. Multiply the total number of seats by 32 (four hours of operation per meal multiplied by two
     turnovers of seats per hour, four meals per day) for each appropriated funded dining facility. Total all
     the seating capacities for appropriated funded facilities.

     15.2.3. Determine actual production capacity for each appropriated food service facility in a 24-hour
     period and total the capacities.

     15.2.4. Ensure the overall seating capacity does not exceed the overall meal production capability. The
     lower of these two figures represents the total emergency capacity for appropriated facilities.

     15.2.5. Feeding capacities of other facilities (i.e., nonappropriated facilities) that will be used must be
     computed based on additional factors, such as preparation and serving equipment and the potential use
     of these facilities for other purposes. The number of facilities identified for use must be supportable
     by the number of incoming and in-place Services manpower.

     15.2.6. Total the capacities for appropriated and nonappropriated funded facilities. This is the overall
     feeding capacity. Divide this number by three to identify the total personnel that can be supported on
     a daily basis.

PART TWO:

15.3. Provide detailed procedures, capabilities, (if different than identified in Part One) and requirements
to provide dining support to in-place, incoming, and transient forces, and Noncombatants awaiting evac-
uation or onward movement. Identify available and required facilities, to include clubs, equipment,
rations, and personnel, as well as sources of supply. Include troop issue operations. After coordinating
with appropriate functional managers, prioritize the listing of food service facilities in the order that will
support the plan. Appropriated and nonappropriated facilities should have the highest priority.

15.4. From the TPFDD, determine the total base population (including US/Local National E-E, Key and
Contingency Essential civilians) to be supported. In actual wartime, and especially at isolated locations,
90% of meal cardholders and separate ration personnel may eat in base dining facilities. This planning
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                            79


factor is based on the base workload, number of hours people are on base (if applicable), the security
threat of the base, and consumption data (ref AFMAN 10-401).

   15.4.1. Compare the figure above with the total emergency feeding capacity calculated in Part One to
   determine if additional feeding support is required.

   15.4.2. If the base population to be supported is smaller than the emergency capacity, determine which
   facilities will be used, the number of hours of operations required, and include in the plan. If other
   than appropriated funded facilities are to be used, they will be operated as an appropriated funded
   facility and the base food service will be responsible for the management and will ensure the augmen-
   tation scheduled for the base food service is sufficient to support these facilities.

   15.4.3. If the base population exceeds the food service capability, review the appropriate TPFDD to
   determine if field kitchens are scheduled for the base. If they are, include the capability in the plan.
   Determine the number of people the field kitchens will support and compare against the shortage.

15.5. Determine the amount of potable water required for each food service facility using their emergency
capacity as a baseline. Use a figure of 10 gallons of water per person per day for each food facility. Trans-
portation of emergency potable water is to be arranged through the BCE planner and reflected in the plan.

15.6. Source of Rations. (Ration = 3 meals for one person for one day)

   15.6.1. State how initial requirements can be furnished. For example, initial requirements can be fur-
   nished from __________days supply on hand as follows:

   Operational Rations (MRE)- _________Rations

   DECA Peacetime Operating Stocks (POS)- __________Rations

   Appropriated Funded Stocks (Dining Hall)-____________Rations

   Miscellaneous Stocks -_____________ Rations

   Non-Appropriated Funded Stocks (MWR) programmed for NEO support (not to be included in avail-
   able rations for OPLAN implementation)

   15.6.2. POCs/Phone Numbers for rations are as follows:

   PRIMARY
   ALTERNATE
   DeCA
   APPROPRIATE FUNDED (FOOD SERVICE)
   AAFES
   NONAPPROPRIATED FUNDED (MWR)
   LOGISTICS PLANS (WRM)
80                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


     15.6.3. Movement of rations from resupply points will be accomplished by _________________.

15.7. Flight Meals. Flight meals will be prepared at __________ building, as required.

15.8. Reimbursement. Include procedures for reimbursement if different from normal.

15.9. Hospital Patient Feeding. Subsistence and facility planning should be based on providing three pre-
pared meals per day to 90% of the patients in the Military Healthcare Facility (MHF), 100% of any con-
valescent patients and 100% of the aeromedical staging facility (ASF) patient capacity. Ten percent (10%)
of the MHF patients will not be receiving meals for health care reasons. Flight meals will be needed for
aeromedical evacuation patients based on the number of evacuees per day. Medical diet technicians deter-
mine and order medical unique rations items, and transport meals to medical facilities.

15.10. Shelter stocking. If appropriate for the threat, describe the shelter stocking plan for food items and
water to include the basis for food stock/water calculations, specific procedures and resources that will be
used to deliver the stocks to shelters, timing of initial and resupply actions, accountability parameters and
a sustainment assessment (without resupply). Ensure this information is cross referenced to the shelter
assignment and capacity information contained in the NBCC chapter.

                                               LODGING


PART I:

15.1. Identify the total lodging capacity using the definitions and criteria listed below. Total lodging
capacity will be computed according to the priorities established in paragraph B15.1.9 and using the
emergency capacity planning factor of 50 sq. ft per person. Bases may go below 50 sq. ft per person only
when the TPFDD population exceeds the rate at which housekeeping assets are erected. For safety rea-
sons, reduction in square footage per person must not obstruct entrances or exits. Determination of total
lodging capacity is based on the scenario. For example, in most exercise receptions, only visiting officer/
enlisted quarters, contract quarters, and available dorms will be considered. However, during a contin-
gency or OPLAN situation, emergency quarters (e.g., base fitness center, recreation center, etc.) will be
used. Additionally, during a contingency or OPLAN execution, vacated base housing and dorms (due to
deploying forces and noncombatant evacuations) will be considered. In computing total emergency lodg-
ing capacity consider the type of facilities available (e.g., room-bath-room configuration vs. central
latrine). A dormitory bedroom with the room-bath-room configuration may be large enough to accommo-
date four bed spaces, however eight people using one bathroom is unacceptable. Also, a percentage of the
total lodging capacity will need to be set aside for storage of personal property left behind by departed
(deployed) personnel and noncombatants (applies to dormitories and family housing). Note: Although
some lodging categories will not have to be utilized in Part II of the IGESP, all priorities (except Contin-
gency Housekeeping Assets) should be included in the computation of capacities in Part I.

   15.1.1. Normal Capacity. The number of beds located in the facility whether occupied or not.

   15.1.2. Emergency Capacity. The total capacity of officer, enlisted, and emergency facilities by
   expanded and converted with addition beds and cots. Determine the capacity of these facilities based
   on providing 50 sq ft of net living area per person. Refer to AFI 34-246 for a definition of net living
   area. Only after the initial 30-day beddown or population surge should square footage be increased to
   accommodate quality of life standards of 72 sq ft and 110 sq ft for enlisted and officers, respectively
   (if space is available).

   15.1.3. Transient Quarters. Transient quarters include Visiting Officers' Quarters (VOQ), Visiting
   Quarters (VQ), Distinguished Visitors (DV) suites, and Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLF).

   15.1.4. Dormitories. These facilities include single/unaccompanied personnel housing such as Unac-
   companied Airmen Quarters (UAQ), Unaccompanied Officer Quarters (UOQ), and Unaccompanied
   Noncommissioned Officer Quarters (UNCOQ).

   15.1.5. Commercial Lodging/Contract Quarters. Commercial hotels and motels may be used to house
   Air Force civilian and active duty military personnel when on-base transient quarters are filled. Wing
   commander approval is required to use off-base quarters during contingency operations. Lodging
   should provide the expected number of personnel in commercial lodging/contract quarters and
   approximate distance from the installation.
82                                                                AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


     15.1.6. Alternate Permanent Facilities. Under emergency conditions, other types of buildings besides
     dormitories and transient quarters may be used. Types of buildings that may be suitable for such pur-
     poses are fitness centers, warehouses, and hangars, provided toilets and showers are available. In areas
     where NBCC threats exist and/or the climate is very cold or hot, the adequacy of personnel protection
     and the availability of heating and cooling systems in these facilities should be considered.

15.1.7. Family Housing. As a last resort, family housing units may be used to house transient people. In
overseas areas where a NEO program is to be implemented in wartime to evacuate dependents and US cit-
izens, using family housing is a viable way to provide housing for NEO evacuees. Such a plan will house
incoming NEO families and unaccompanied personnel in family quarters vacated by families already
evacuated. Families not yet evacuated may be asked to house NEO personnel in their quarters on a volun-
tary or even mandatory basis in wartime. Family housing should be used for transient unaccompanied per-
sonnel only when no other practical alternative exists. The wing commander will determine whether
family housing will be used for lodging. In instances where an NBCC threat exists and family housing is
used for NEO operations, Services personnel will distribute brochures (developed by CE Readiness)
describing how to transform the living quarters into a protective shelter. Refer to the NEO chapter of the
IGESP/ESP for additional information.

15.1.8. Facilities under construction. For planning purposes, include facilities under construction and
respective estimated completion dates. Consider availability of toilets and showers as in paragraph
B15.1.6. above.

15.1.9. Lodging Priorities. The priority for lodging personnel is as follows:
     Priority 1: Emergency capacity for all transient quarters
     Priority 2: Commercial lodging/contract quarters
     Priority 3: Emergency capacity in dormitories
     Priority 4: Alternate permanent facilities
     Priority 5: Family housing
     Priority 6: Contingency Housekeeping Assets (Note: List all WRM assets, including beds, cots, tents,
     Harvest Housekeeping Sets, and any other contingency housekeeping assets, in Part II (classified) of
     the IGESP (paragraph B15.5.5.3.). However, include the following statement in Part I: “See Part II of
     the IGESP for in-place/due-in WRM assets”).

15.2. The following outlines how lodging capacities should be calculated and what information should be
documented.

Example: This is a list of lodging facilities and respective capacities that currently exist at
_________________AB. Priorities are shown for all existing facilities as to desirability for deployment
assignments. Emergency lodging facilities are also shown.

NOTE: These facilities do not have any bedding available. All housing standards must still be complied
with should these facilities be used (housing officers and enlisted personnel with unique job criteria, i.e.,
aircrews, shift workers, etc.). Identify proximity to latrine facilities, whether BCE assistance is required
for conversion to emergency quarters (coordinate with the CE chapter of the BSP), and whether emer-
gency shower and toilet facilities are required.

PART TWO:

15.3. Using the latest approved all-services TPFDD, compute the following data that will be used to deter-
mine the total number of people requiring lodging. This formula does not take into account non-combat-
ants awaiting evacuation or onward movement.

(Add)
IN-PLACE FORCES*
INCOMING FORCES**

(Subtract)
DEPLOYING FORCES

(Equals)
TOTAL BASE POPULATION REQUIRING LODGING

*Include personnel living off base who, under contingency/wartime conditions, would require on-base
lodging. Include E-E civilian employees remaining at the installation who would require on-base lodging.

**By C-Day, include transiting forces that require temporary lodging.

15.4. Housing Concepts. Specify how housing services will be provided on a 24-hour basis in the order/
sequence/priority of actions to be taken. Develop a plan/agreement to ensure that the civil engineers will
provide personnel during the execution of this plan to issue keys for the buildings that they manage (dor-
mitories, family housing, etc.).

15.5. Augmentation personnel will be used to expand sleeping areas by erecting bunk beds, cots, and
tents, rearranging base facilities to emergency quarters, and providing 24-hour lodging and linen
exchange service.

EXAMPLES:

     15.5.1. During initial stages of plan implementation, the lodging NCOIC, the CES furnishings man-
     agement supervisor, and civilian/local national personnel assigned to lodging will begin 12-hour shifts
     on a 24-hour basis, effective C-day.

     15.5.2. _________ military shift supervisors in lodging and local national/civilian temporary augmen-
     tees from other less essential base functions (specify) will be provided on C-day to assist in 24-hour a
     day lodging assignments, linen/bedding issues, and furnishings placement during initial stages of unit
     arrivals.

15.5.3. ________personnel from (specify unit) will provide augmentation support (determine require-
ments IAW the READY program and the Personnel chapter of the IGESP).

     15.5.4. _______augmentees (specify officer/enlisted grades) will be in-place no later than C+ . local
     national/ civilian overhires will be employed to initiate and continue furnishings movement to facili-

   ties identified in Part I. SF Forms 52 will be prepared in advance and processed to CCPO on C-day for
   expedient hiring.

   15.5.5. Assignment of quarters. Personnel will process through the reception processing unit (RPU)
   (Bldg #). Lodging personnel will be under the direction of the RPU chief during this initial phase.
   Registration cards and linen/bedding accountability records will be sufficient to cover the pro-
   grammed TPFDD flow of personnel. Number of officers and airmen will be pre-organized and assign-
   ments indicated in accordance with lodging, dormitories, and housing facilities planned per Part I.
   Room keys will be organized for issue for each facility (except for tents) per the "emergency capacity"
   in Part One. Base maps showing beddown facilities (including emergency quarters and tent areas) and
   transportation routing from the RPU will be displayed at the registration point. Personnel will com-
   plete a registration card prior to key issue. Lodging personnel will mark locator cards with building
   number, room number, and phone number (if applicable), and issue initial linen/bedding. Special con-
   sideration will be given to aircrew members to maximize crew rest and to maintain aircrew integrity.
   This will be done by housing two crew members per room in vacant VOQ or VAQ room (see Part
   One).

       15.5.5.1. Officer and enlisted personnel room assignments will be made and keys issued at the
       RPU by lodging office and Civil Engineering dorm management or housing representatives.
       When possible, quarters assignments will be done with consideration of unit integrity.

       15.5.5.2. Lodging of medical personnel should be taken into consideration since immediate recall
       of hospital staffs to support mass casualty influxes from base attack and other locations is a real
       and constant concern. Such lodging should be as close to the hospital as is available. Medical per-
       sonnel should also be housed together to afford quicker access and recall. This is not the case for
       Aeromedical Crews, who should be housed with other AMC crews for alert access.

15.5.5.3. The following outlines how and where the base population will be assigned lodging and what
documentation is required. Assignments will be based on capacities and priorities in Part I. Rooms will
contain only essential furnishings. Try to specify designated unit/occupant and the date the building will
be required (by C-day per the TPFDD). Assign incoming personnel to rooms vacated by permanent party
personnel deployed to other locations or evacuated under NEO, as required. Develop a plan for securing
personal property left behind by all departing personnel and dependents to include designated storage
facility and managing unit. Relocation of permanent party personnel and their personal possessions to
accommodate and consolidate incoming personnel should be avoided.

        *Include time-phased erection schedule, if applicable (coordinate with the CE chapter of the
        BSP).

        **State intended place of use; e.g. dormitory, base fitness center, tent city, etc.

15.6. Contact base contracting to define level of housekeeping and other lodging services to be provided.
If none are available, individuals will provide their own housekeeping services.

15.7. Unplanned arrivals (personnel) will be briefed at base operations/passenger terminal to report
directly to the RPU, Bldg until terminated; then to lodging office, Bldg , for assignment to quarters. The
same procedures in paragraph B15.5.5. apply. Normally, the number of unplanned personnel will not
exceed the fallouts of planned personnel. Therefore, an additive planning factor is not required.

15.8. Use one officer to five airmen and one female to ten male personnel as a planning factor when des-
ignating lodging facilities. AF policy in the housing of women in deployment situations states, "There is
only one requirement which must be met in the housing for women in deployment situations: privacy in
sleeping and bathing/latrine facilities. Exclusively separate quarters or bathing and latrine facilities are
not essential. Bathing and latrine facilities can be scheduled on a time-sharing basis or with appropriate
occupied/unoccupied signs; temporary makeshift partitions may be used to afford quarter’s privacy. Envi-
ronmental conditions and/or austere living accommodations cannot be considered limiting factors in the
use of women in deployment situations. Women can function under the same environmental conditions
and use the same existing facilities as men, including the most adverse and primitive." (Reference USAF
WMP Volume I, Annex GG). To ensure the incoming number of personnel is current, coordination with
base LGX should be performed and the date of coordination documented. Incoming officer and enlisted
personnel will be assigned to designated emergency areas as shown in Part One. Consideration should be
given to designation of separate areas for officer and airmen, if feasible. Female personnel will be housed
in separate facilities (where practical) as shown in Part One.

15.9. Vehicles. (Coordinate with the Transportation chapter of the IGESP) Unit Services personnel will
plan vehicle requirements. Coordinate with unit VCO and the Vehicle Operations Fleet Management Sec-
tion to ensure completeness prior to the Transportation Function consolidation of unit requirements for
publication of the IGESP. The Transportation Function prior to their inclusion in the IGESP must approve
all subsequent changes to vehicle authorizations, including WRM vehicles.

15.10. Communications and Information. Identify any communications and information requirements
beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for consideration include: basic phone services, comput-
ers, networking capabilities (classified and unclassified), secure phone instruments, LMRs and/or pagers,
secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing capabilities. The installation must also have the
ability to rapidly notify housed personnel of impending or actual force protection threats i.e., fires, bomb
threats, imminent enemy attack, presence of contamination, etc. Services personnel must verify the ade-
quacy of in-place notification systems (with assistance from CE Readiness, Communications, fire fight-
ers, etc.) If the installation warning and notification network is insufficient in personnel housing facilities,
Services personnel will work with CE Readiness and Communications personnel to develop work around
mitigation measures. Coordinate with installation Communications Officer prior to consolidation of
requirements into Base Support Plan. Insure these requirements are addressed in Chapter 28.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                           91


15.11. In areas where the CB threat warrants, Services and CE Readiness personnel must jointly develop
response procedures for instances where CB contamination adversely affects personnel housing facilities.
This includes immediate response actions by off-shift personnel located in these facilities, relocation pri-
orities and procedures/criteria, and techniques for verifying the safety of previously contaminated facili-
ties. Describe the concept of operations for these activities. Cross reference this information to the
material contained in the NBCC chapter. CRITICAL. RATIONALE: This vital area must be addressed as
it is one of the largest unrealistic “simulations” associated with peacetime training and exercises.
Non-preparedness for this probable event will result in unnecessary mission degradation and personnel
injuries/fatalities.

                                          LAUNDRY SUPPORT


PART ONE:

15.1. Planning factors for programming laundry support:

15.1.1. Medical, third and fourth echelons (3E and 4E), to include Expeditionary Medical Systems and/or
Air Force Theater Hospitals --each 500 bed hospital requires four bare base tactical field laundry (TFL)
units.


     15.1.1.1. Patients--32 pounds per patient per week.

     15.1.1.2. Medical Staff--32 pounds per person per week. NOTE: Only those staff members who come
     in direct biological contact with patients will have their uniforms laundered by Services.

     15.1.1.3. Organizational Bulk (sleeping bags, parkas, etc.)--10 pounds per person per week.

15.1.2. Laundry programming for Air Force units should be provided from the following sources in the
priority indicated, if available:

     15.1.2.1. Commercial contract.

     15.1.2.2. Other military facilities through joint agreements.

     15.1.2.3. Air Force industrial funded laundries.

     15.1.2.4. Bare base laundries (e.g., self-help laundries, UNIMAC, Containerized Batch Laundries or
     TFL) will be used in situations when above resources are not available or are insufficient to handle the

     16.16.6.4. Briefing incoming medical forces on medical intelligence.

  16.17. Aeromedical Evacuation. Remember that with the exception of Aeromedical Evacuation Con-
  trol Team (AECT), most tactical AE units are mobile and may be planned to arrive at an air base only
  for staging purposes. Theater AECT will dictate their final destination based upon the tactical situa-
  tion and progress of the war or buildup period.

     16.17.1. Resource Requirements. Tactical AE units provide not only deployment but also are
     somewhat self sufficient. Other AE assets, especially crews and strategic AE ground support ele-
     ments, require prepositioned assets. Such resources must be planned for.

     16.17.2. Buildings for Squadron Operations. These buildings should include space for AE:

         16.17.2.1. Command Section and Orderly Room.

         16.17.2.2. Control Center.

         16.17.2.3. Crew Briefing Rooms.

         16.17.2.4. Crew Alert Rooms.

         16.17.2.5. Supply and Equipment Maintenance.

         16.17.2.6. Vehicle Parking.

             16.17.2.6.1. Vehicles. The following are minimal requirements to support a strategic AE
             location.

                 16.17.2.6.1.1. Pickups - Two

                 16.17.2.6.1.2. Step Vans - Two

     16.17.3. Communications. The AE unit should be provided handheld radios from the host AMC
     element for AE mission launch and recovery duties. Ensure the base Communications Officer is
     aware High Frequency (HF) radios will be operated by AE Control Centers, liaison teams or
     Mobile Aeromedical Evacuation Staging Facilities.

     16.17.4. Medical Resupply and Equipment Maintenance. Resupply of AE contingency kits along
     with storage should be planned well in advance of a contingency. Maintenance on AE equipment
     should also be planned for.

                                  CHAPTER 20 - TRANSPORTATION


This chapter is prepared by the Chief of Transportation through the auspices of the Transportation Combat
Readiness and Resources Flight as the focal point for reception, organization, and coordination of war-
time transportation support for the Traffic Management Flight, the Vehicle Operations Flight, and the
Vehicle Maintenance Flight.

PART ONE:

20.1. This section provides an overview of transportation capabilities for base forces and units participat-
ing in activities involving the base (deployment from, deployment to, or transit) during peacetime exer-
cises and day-to-day operations. The Base Support Plan (IGESP) Part I is, in effect, a unit capabilities
plan. The following format should be followed in developing Part I.

20.2. References: List references (AFPDs, AFIs, DOD Directives, etc.) used in preparation of this chapter.

20.3. Support Capabilities. The key to effective base support planning is a thorough understanding of the
day-to-day capabilities of the transportation unit, as well as the threat, the planned operational response of
the wing, and requirements of transiting forces.

20.4. Functional Assumptions. List all factors taken into consideration to determine base support capabil-
ities. For example, normal duty hours, reliance on commercial contractors for specific functions, etc. An
important point to remember is that each assumption will have a major impact on the ability to meet
IGESP responsibilities should the assumption prove to be incorrect.

20.5. Resources. This paragraph should provide an overview of base transportation capabilities, and serve
as an outline for branch managers to consider in drafting respective inputs to the plan, or it can be com-
piled after the inputs are received. Considerations vary at each base and the information entered is an
instant picture of all things considered in your ability to support peacetime operations, and which justify a
need for additional augmentation during exercise/wartime situations. Review of applicable considerations
at each base is the responsibility of all transportation managers and planners. Consider (as a minimum)
the following when completing this section: aircraft generation mobility, deployment, reception, WRM
availability, normal passenger/cargo movements on/off base, base operability support, scheduled airlift
aircraft on a 24 hour basis , vehicle/equipment leasing support, mobile maintenance capability, sub-motor
pool locations, remote site vehicle repair requirements, and augmentation taskings which result in a loss
of transportation personnel to other functions. Also include the following:

      20.5.1. Reference (cite) the agreements and procedures to provide support or obtain support from host
      nation, other Services, or contract.

      20.5.2. Identification of authorized personnel and area of assignment.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                         117


   20.5.3. Identification of available equipment (e.g., MHE, tire chains, computers, etc).

   20.5.4. Peacetime vehicle authorizations/assignments.

   20.5.5. Identification and location of all transportation facilities.

   20.5.6. Vehicle recall procedures.

PART TWO:

20.6. This section contains guidance limited to actions taking place during ExPlan/OPLAN execution and
describes transportation requirements, resources, and procedures to support in-place, inbound, outbound,
and transiting forces of all services, including NEO operations, if directed. Identify specific transporta-
tion-unique response procedures or activities such as Vehicle Maintenance’s logging of contaminated
vehicles into the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System (OLVIMS).

20.7. Arrangements must be made through the logistics plans function for briefing the Chief of Transpor-
tation and officers/superintendents on threat assessments and contemplated C-day/D-day operational
responses to exercise and wartime requirements. An understanding of worst case scenarios with antici-
pated aircraft generation, deployment taskings, augmentation, command, control, and communications
(C3), and critical support areas by transportation planners and managers is essential to planning and exe-
cuting effective transportation support. Information gained from the logistics plans function, combined
with in-depth reviews of applicable ExPlan/OPLAN annexes will enable transportation planners and
managers to establish priorities and schedule resources to meet peacetime and wartime needs. Close atten-
tion must be given to timing and simultaneous events necessitating maximum use of transportation
resources to identify potential LIMFACS, which must be resolved.

20.8. Support Concept. The documented support concept will provide a unit level general concept of
operations under contingency/wartime conditions. It will explain what the transportation unit is expected
to accomplish and the procedures/methods to do so. The transportation combat readiness function is the
focal point for transportation taskings and deployment operations and will be furnished with any requests
for deviation from established procedure/policy and the additional or unexpected commitment of trans-
portation resources of any transportation branch. Upon OPLAN/deployment exercise execution, the
Deployment Control Unit (DCU) transportation representative will assume the responsibilities of Trans-
portation combat readiness function.

20.9. Functional Assumptions. List all factors taken into consideration during formulation of support
plans for OPLAN execution. Use the same format as in Part One, but focus on assumptions critical to
operation in a wartime environment.

20.10. Planning Considerations. This paragraph should provide an overview of plan taskings and detail
procedures that address requirements of the taskings. It can serve as an outline for branch managers to
consider in drafting respective inputs to the plan or it can be compiled after inputs are received.

   20.10.20. Bare base/satellite base support requirements.

   20.10.21. Communications and Information. Identify any communications and information require-
   ments beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for considerations include: basic phone ser-
   vices, computers, networking capabilities (classified and unclassified), secure phone instruments,
   LMRs and/or pagers, secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing capabilities. Coordinate
   with installation Communications Officer prior to consolidation of requirements into Base Support
   Plan. Insure these requirements are addressed in Chapter 28.

20.11. Responsibilities. Outline specific responsibilities for the following:

20.11.1. Transportation Combat Readiness and Resources Flight. This office serves as the focal point for
consolidating OPLAN planning and all planning issues affecting the utilization of any and all transporta-
tion resources. It monitors readiness posture of transportation flights. In concert with other transportation
flight chiefs, it performs capability analysis to ensure sufficient resources to meet ExPlan/OPLAN and
resulting IGESP taskings. It also ensures transportation inputs that impact upon airlift requests are fully
coordinated and takes action to resolve transportation deficiencies. During deployment operations, this
flight becomes the TCC support staff as situations and personal expertise permit, and as directed by the
Transportation Function.

20.11.2. Transportation Control Center (TCC). The nerve center of transportation units during deploy-
ment/contingency operations. The TCC is the transportation "command post" and will be capable of being
manned and equipped 24 hours a day. This work center is the command and control for all transportation
resources for the duration of the contingency, and consequently, is the only emergency work center that
does not phase out prior to cessation of the contingency. All transportation work centers will keep the
TCC advised of their status and of all problems and assistance required. The TCC will be the initial source
of contact for all support requests not covered in the IGESP and for IGESP support which is not being
met. Outline your TCC concept of operations and provide essential details of operation.

   20.11.3. Traffic Management Office (TMO). As the movements experts in all available modes and
   having detailed knowledge of processing requirements, the TMO is an essential player in base support
   planning. TMO must be able to investigate alternate modes of moving peacetime, exercise, and con-
   tingency requirements whether through other services, common user land transportation, host nation,
   or commercial sources and determine relative reliability and any legal formalities required. Direct
   support of sortie production is the first priority of USAF transportation resources. All other move-
   ments are allocated to available movement resources IAW mission priority. This is a basic shipping
   and planning function which must be incorporated into base support planning and expanded in contin-
   gency operations. The increased availability of automated systems for the rapid processing and move-
   ment of cargo has improved the overall efficiency of this process. These systems can be deployed to
   allow automation in the field as well as home base.
120                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007



20.11.4. Vehicle Operations Flight. Vehicle Operations is the wing’s single manager for Air Force regis-
tered vehicles, and the sole source of organic movement capability where no unit functional vehicle capa-
bility exists. Units possessing vehicle authorizations are expected to perform movements with in-house
capability. Excess vehicle operations capability beyond that tasked in the IGESP may be requested from
TMO, who will levy lift requirements to both vehicle operations and other available carriers commensu-
rate with established criteria. It is therefore important that vehicle operations identify recurring on-base
support services such as base taxi or shuttle bus operations, or state that such services are not available.

         20.11.4.1. As the OPR for organic capability and filling the wartime vehicle authorizations for
         units requiring in-house capability, vehicle operations staffs authorization requests for both peace-
         time and wartime use and assigns assets IAW the Vehicle Authorization List (VAL). During con-
         tingency operations, vehicle operations recalls peacetime use vehicles and reassigns them to
         wartime authorizations IAW the VAL. Vehicle operations ensures the availability of road kits for
         war readiness vehicles which will be prepositioned to off-base locations. It maintains a fleet of
         vehicles and trained operators to meet preplanned taskings and such requirements as may be
         requested by TMO. Additionally, vehicle operations maintains necessary supply of straps, tiedown
         devices, and other vehicle support supplies as needed to meet the wartime requirements of the
         transportation squadron; acts as focal point for advising vehicle maintenance of shop priorities to
         support contingency vehicle needs (unless superseded by the TCC), rotates vehicles between units
         with special care to ensure availability of sortie producing and aircraft emergency response vehi-
         cles, as well as command and control/base operability response vehicles.

20.11.4.2. Vehicle operations take action IAW appropriate directives to secure approval for WRM vehicle
release and responds to command directives for vehicle shipments to any area. It advises TCC of vehicle
losses for subsequent command action, and keeps the TCC/TMO apprised of organic movement capabil-
ity and mission impact as a result of insufficient vehicle assets. The chief of transportation, through the
Vehicle Operations Flight, will advise contracting of vehicle requirements and quantities. As the wing sin-
gle manager for registered vehicles, only those assets reflected in the transportation chapter are consid-
ered true vehicle requirements. Vehicle requirements will not be reflected in any other IGESP chapter. If
a reference to vehicle is deemed essential, a statement to refer to the transportation chapter will suffice.

         20.11.4.3. Based on a comprehensive review of contingency recurring support requirements, vehi-
         cle operations establishes consolidated operations (such as combining administration/fleet man-
         agement to release manpower for other duties) wherever possible and establishes a sub-motor pool
         (SMP) operation when mission needs dictate. It ensures detailed expedient hardening, dispersal,
         and contamination avoidance “coverage” plans are in effect for the protection of assets, adminis-
         ters the vehicle priority recall plan when directed, and establishes a viable vehicle recovery pro-
         gram in coordination with vehicle maintenance.

         20.11.4.4. Ensure vehicle fuel requirements are coordinated with base fuels. Consider the use of
         alternative fueled vehicles.

      20.11.5. Vehicle Maintenance. During contingency operations and periods of heavy workload, vehicle
      maintenance has the capability of tailoring their workload by waiving non-safety related repairs and
      maintenance. However, these waivered repairs will have to be accomplished in time, and therefore
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                         121


   any waivers due to workload must be held to a minimum. Consequently, vehicle maintenance must
   determine the level of maintenance necessary to support the base on a day-to-day basis, as well as
   what waivers are justified during periods of heavy workload, such as exercises and contingencies.
   Shop and supervisory personnel must be aware of the residual hazards associated with vehicles that
   have been previously contaminated with chemical agents and are responsible for tracking these vehi-
   cles through the use of OLVIMS. Vehicle maintenance managers will need to explore expansion of
   fully or partially equipped mobile maintenance capability and the possibility of satellite maintenance
   sites especially in remote areas of the base or in proximity to flightline operations.

       20.11.5.1. Establish procedures to release vehicles from maintenance shops which when released
       will not violate safety conditions or cause further mechanical deterioration.

       20.11.5.2. Describe maintenance support for off base activities, such as communication sites.

       20.11.5.3. Describe mobile maintenance requirements.

       20.11.5.4. Identify vehicle maintenance priorities, including war reserve vehicles.

       20.11.5.5. A communications network must be established placing maintenance control in touch
       with mobile maintenance, remote locations, and the TCC (when activated). A system of reporting
       all critical vehicle maintenance repair actions must be on line between maintenance, the TCC, and
       vehicle operations.

   20.11.6. Attention needs to be given to potential interruption of supply pipelines and the known recur-
   ring parts failures that could reduce vehicle availability. Mission kits must be fabricated for those
   vehicles to be prepositioned at bare base support locations. Increased emphasis in operator care is also
   warranted under contingency conditions.

20.12. LIMFACS. After comparing base capabilities against OPLAN requirements, identify any limiting
factors and submit to the logistics plans function for review by the IGESPC. If approved, IGESP LIM-
FACs will be documented in the LIMFACs chapter of the IGESP and forwarded to MAJCOM HQ and the
NAF.

                           CHAPTER 21 - AIR MOBILITY OPERATIONS


This chapter (in an IGESP Part I) should be developed by local air transportation agencies in consultation
with HQ AMC/A4X. This chapter (in an IGESP Part II) must be developed with the assistance of HQ
AMC/A4X. Depending on temporary assigned duty/temporary duty (TAD/TDY) budgets that may limit
HQ AMC participation at planning conferences, any revision proposed for this chapter by any level of
theater planning staff (e.g. unified, air component command/combat numbered air force (NAF), or wing/
unit) should be sent to HQ AMC/A4X for review and concurrence prior to publication and dissemination.

PART ONE:

21.1. Provide a general overview of aerial port procedures and capabilities.

21.2. Describe the aerial port location. Identify possible cargo aircraft offload areas, aircraft explosives
cargo parking areas to include a cargo contamination control area (CCA) if the threat warrants, cargo mar-
shalling and breakdown areas, office, storage (include weapons and classified storage requirements),
refrigeration and freezer capabilities, tanker airlift control elements, deployment control center, cargo
deployment function, reception control center, and other operating areas, primary and alternate locations
for aeromedical evacuation aircraft loading with engines off and engines running; primary and secondary
locations for AMC mobile aeromedical staging facilities.

21.3. Aircraft that can be handled in 24 hours during peacetime operations or OOTW should be annotated
for both uncontaminated and CB contaminated environments. Cargo support aircraft that can be handled
in a 24 hour period will vary due to types programmed to transit the base and the purpose of the mission.
Estimate the base's capabilities under different aircraft configurations using standard planning factors for
cargo or passenger allowable cabin load (ACL) and ground times based on calculations. NOTE: Through-
put capacity is a function of the maximum number of aircraft that can be on the ground and serviced
simultaneously in any one 24-hour period for each function, air transportation, command and control, air-
craft maintenance, refueling etc. This can be derived by multiplying the number of aircraft that can be ser-
viced simultaneously, by the expected ground time. For example, five C-141s can be serviced at one time;
each C-141 can be cycled (received, offloaded and launched) every 2 hours. Factors will vary with turn-
around requirements, such as refueling, crew rest, and others. Other factors affecting throughput capacity
are load scales, hot cargo pad, net explosive weight (NEW) limitations, high line docks, and container
handling. Major command transportation staffs should provide necessary guidance.

21.4. Identify MHE and identify the sources (e.g., host nation or other source). Include 463L 10K forklifts
or equivalent, 25K loaders or equivalent, new small loaders (once procured and fielded), 40K loaders or
equivalent, 60K loaders, wide-body elevator loaders (WBEL)/high lift loaders for the KC-10, commer-
cial/civil reserve air fleet (CRAF) loaders, pallet dollies and trailers, tugs, 4-6K forklifts, if appropriate;
international standardization organization container handling equipment; highlights or jetways for CRAF
aircraft used for aeromedical evacuation; identify availability of lights or light carts for night operations;
supplies and source of supplies for aerial port operations (such as dunnage).
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                             123


PART TWO:

21.5. This Chapter will be written/authored by HQ AMC/A4X with technical assistance regarding infra-
structure, operations in NBC environments, and funding issues being provided from HQ AMC/XP and
CE and any unique force protection issues being coordinated on by HQ AMC/SFX. The Part II chapter
will be broken into four distinct or “main” parts.

   21.5.1. The four parts will include: tanker/airlift control element (TALCE), strategic airlift aircraft and
   strategic air refueling aircraft maintenance, aerial port operations, and overages/shortfalls/LIMFACs.
   The Part Two chapters will reflect the entire spectrum of functional area support and will outline all of
   AMC’s requirements for sustained operations. This format is applicable for strategic airlift aircraft
   aerial ports of debarkation (APODs) (more commonly known as simple “off-load locations” or “unit
   move locations”) and for locations where the beddown of TRANSCOM-owned/AMC “air bridge”
   aircraft or personnel occur [read: non-chopped or non-theater augmentation aircraft]. In these
   instances, the chapter inputs should not be broken up into functional areas by the host logistics plans
   functions.

   21.5.2. However, where AMC strategic air refueling aircraft or tactical airlift aircraft “chop” to the
   theater in an augmentation role (supporting fighter/bomber employment and theater logistics mis-
   sions), the format will follow host logistics plans function’s guidelines and may be broken into func-
   tional chapters.

21.5.3. Each CONUS plans office will evaluate the worst case OPLAN "All Forces" TPFDD and deter-
mine throughput and reception. If over any 30-day period the base throughput exceeds 3000 short tons of
cargo or 10,000 PAX, or receives/beddowns over 300 personnel or is considered a primary NEO Repatri-
ation Airfield, the base must write Chapter 21, Part II. If a base meets this criteria, local base logistics and
transportation planners will complete a Chapter 21, Part II and submit it to HQ AMC/A4X for final vali-
dation. If a base does not meet these criteria, only Chapter 21 Part I is required.

21.6. Provide a general overview of aerial port requirements during OPLAN/CONPLAN execution. Iden-
tify specific responsibilities for unit and nonunit cargo and personnel and their relationships with the
deployment and reception control centers, if different than what is identified in Part One.

21.7. Identify the following assigned and required MHE from the applicable TPFDD as planned by
HQ AMC/DOZ. Total requirements for air transportation personnel/equipment/vehicles will not vary
from TPFDD requirements without prior coordination with HQ AMC/DOZ before publication. TPFDD
requirements may not consider all equipment available for use at the base because requirements could be
filled by incoming assets while base assets may be tasked to forward deploy because of operational neces-
sity/timing.

21.8. Additionally, a passenger terminal facility, air freight warehouse, covered storage areas, hot cargo
pads, and pallet grid yard will be identified. Aircraft parking positions (cargo and support aircraft parking
positions will vary due to types programmed to transit the base) will be identified.

21.9. At a minimum, address parking capabilities for C-5, C-9, (C-12, C-20, C-21, or other operational
support aircraft (OSA) as necessary), C-17, C-27, C-130, C-141, KC-135/KC-10 (as warranted), and
124                                                              AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


CRAF aircraft. These parking capabilities should be reflected for each type of aircraft assuming no other
cargo or support aircraft are on the ground at the same time (i.e., "the base is capable of supporting
______C-130s, if no other cargo or support aircraft are on the ground at the same time"). NOTE: The host
or lead wing should address parking capabilities for theater assets (i.e., C-12, C-130). Combination air-
craft parking MOG must also be calculated based on the most likely transient or beddown aircraft types
identified in the USAF WMP-4/WAAR, or an interpretation of modeling products from the AMC Deploy-
ment Analysis System (ADANS) and Combined Mating and Ranging Planning System (CMARPS) pro-
vided by HQ AMC IGESP team members at Part II planning conferences. Remember to take into account
bomber/fighter parking requirements as addressed in Chapter 8, “Airfield Loading/ Parking Plan.”

21.10. Communications and Information. Identify any communications and information requirements
beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for considerations include: basic phone services, comput-
ers, networking capabilities (classified and unclassified), secure phone instruments, LMRs and/or pagers,
secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing capabilities. Coordinate with installation Communi-
cations Officer prior to consolidation of requirements into Base Support Plan. Insure these requirements
are addressed in Chapter 28.

21.11. If the threat warrants, describe cargo movement operations in NBC environments. As a minimum,
include the following:

      21.11.1. Likely operating environments

      21.11.2. Decision trees for aircraft movement after a chemical attack

      21.11.3. Cargo contamination avoidance and control procedures

      21.11.4. Contaminated airfield cargo movement operations

         21.11.4.1. Establishment and operation of cargo CCA

         21.11.4.2. Integration of mission criticality and hazard category

      21.11.5. Offload operations (Transload if appropriate)

         21.11.5.1. Clean to dirty

         21.11.5.2. Dirty to clean

21.12. The overages/shortfalls/LIMFACs section will address those areas of either surplus or critical need
for AMC as calculated against total base resources and all other known common-user or unique theater
requirements on those scarce base resources.

                       CHAPTER 22 - WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM)


PART 1: IS NOT DEVELOPED FOR THIS CHAPTER

PART 2:

22.1. WRM planning identified in the IGESP is not a restatement of AFI 25-101 responsibilities and
requirements. Rather, it identifies local requirements and procedures necessary to ensure in-place and
incoming WRM can support the operations.

22.2. During IGESP site surveys, using units will identify Base Operating Support (BOS) requirements
(i.e., vehicles) to the host base and include it in the IGESP Part II. The host base will forward BOS
requirements to its NAF for review. The NAF will then forward BOS requirements to its MAJCOM for
inclusion in its War Plans Additive Requirements Report (WPARR) - Part II. The WPARR- Part I will be
submitted by the using units MAJCOM to identify non-BOS requirements (i.e., aviation support equip-
ment). Requirements will be identified by base of planned use in the WPARR.

22.3. Identify movement requirements for assets and ensure all assets are scheduled. Identify all vehicle
and materiel handling equipment (required and available packing material such as pallets, nets, dunnage,
and tiedown devices to ship by preplanned modes). Describe procedures for requesting air, sea, and
ground transportation. Identify all manpower requirements needed for such tasks as outload documenta-
tion and preparation; tiedown, blocking, and bracing; and onloading and offloading at railheads. Identify
units to which assets will be issued, to the extent possible.

22.4. Develop expedient hardening, dispersal, and contamination avoidance “coverage” plans for all
assigned WRM assets and WRM that arrives from other storage locations. Identify priority of assets to be
dispersed. Identify all manpower and materiel required for dispersal.

22.5. Describe procedures to ensure necessary parts, modifications, and shelf-life items are available and
distributed with assets.

22.6. Provide the information for major items, commodities, or UTCs to be moved on or off base as indi-
cated in Tab 1.

22.7. Provide the information for major items, commodities, or UTCs to be received as indicated in Tab 2.

22.8. After comparing capabilities against OPLAN requirements, identify any limiting factors and submit
them to the logistics plans office for review by the IGESPC.

PART ONE:

23.1. List existing support agreements that will remain in effect during contingency/wartime in this chap-
ter by agreement number, supplier, receiver, and a short summary of support provided.

23.2. Support provided by other major commands, services, or nations, does not require duplication
within the IGESP if the agreement was negotiated to remain in effect during contingencies. Agreements
identified to remain in effect during contingency/wartime will contain a statement in the remarks section
of the agreement allowing for this support. Care must be taken to identify basic logistical support that may
be covered via support agreement but not arranged for during OPLAN execution. This information should
be included in the IGESP. Examples of basic logistical support provided under support agreements
includes power, communications, water, messing, facilities, transportation, maintenance, and personnel
services. Care must taken to identify the Local National employee status as described in Host National
Support agreements during contingency/wartime operations and insure any restrictions or conditions are
incorporated in the planning process.

                                    CHAPTER 24 - MAINTENANCE


The Logistics Group (LG) or Operations Group (OG) Commander or equivalent who manages the flight
line maintenance function prepares this chapter, with inputs and assistance from squadrons and agencies
with aircraft maintenance responsibilities. Part 1 of this chapter outlines the general maintenance capabil-
ities of the installation which currently exist and are separated into three separate sections; on-equipment
(flight line) maintenance, off-equipment (backshop/intermediate maintenance), and maintenance opera-
tions. These capabilities may not be available to all incoming units; incoming units must coordinate with
the installation to ensure that a capability they may wish to use is deploying, not dedicated to another unit,
or otherwise unavailable. Part 2 covers OPLAN specific actions/procedures and will also be addressed in
the same three subsections.

PART ONE:

24.1. Outline the general maintenance plan to support aircraft operations. Maintenance of aircraft and
associated support equipment will be performed IAW Air Force and applicable MAJCOM aircraft main-
tenance instructions; use this area to discuss any peculiarities of organization or operations that affect the
base. For example, 15 ABW might note that no LSS is assigned to the base, so engine management issues
are worked directly with the 15th Logistics Support Division. Additionally, units receiving day-to-day
and/or contingency support from collocated or nearby units, facilities, and airfields (military or commer-
cial) for aircraft operations should identify this in the IGESP, Part I. This applies to Air Force Reserve
Component (AFRC) / Air National Guard (ANG) units receiving support from an active unit or active
units receiving reciprocal support from the AFRC/ANG.

24.2. On-equipment Maintenance (Logistics or Operations Group): Outline existing maintenance capabil-
ities in the following areas:

   24.2.1. Mission Design Series (MDSs) Currently Supported/Supportable. Outline the type(s) of air-
   craft the unit currently maintains and the level of support provided. Discussion should include:

       24.2.1.1. Each MDS currently supported at the unit.

       24.2.1.2. Other configuration items for which the unit provides flight line support (e.g., Low Alti-
       tude Navigation Terrain-Following Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) pods, specific types of Elec-
       tronic Counter Measures (ECM) pods, Alternate Mission Equipment (AME), etc.).

       24.2.1.3. Any variations from standard unit maintenance capabilities for launch, recovery, servic-
       ing, and removal/replacement actions.

      tenance areas. Provide narrative as required on these topics and on quiet hours, airfield lighting, drain-
      age problems, etc., as they may effect aircraft maintenance.

24.2.4. Transportation. Note transportation requirements, sources, distribution, and maintenance/control
procedures not covered elsewhere. Compute additional vehicle requirements considering on-hand vehicle
fleet, as well as any WRM vehicles assigned to your unit. Provide requirements to the Transportation
Function by vehicle type, number currently authorized for peacetime operation, number currently
assigned, and number required to support OPLAN requirements. Coordinate with the Transportation
Function to ensure completeness before they consolidate wing requirements in the Transportation Chapter
of the IGESP. All subsequent changes of vehicle authorizations, including WRM vehicles, must have the

                                        FORMAT FOR IGESP/ESP
                                       CHAPTER 25 - MUNITIONS


PART I:

25.1. In coordination with the Logistics Group Commander, munitions units will develop munitions
employment plans (MEP) using the following guidance. The plan must be in direct support of taskings
outlined in applicable OPLANS, CONPLANS, and the IGESP.

25.2. For CONPLAN taskings, since there are usually no specific munitions build or load-out details,
planning will encompass those actions required to deploy and general actions that are the same for any
scenario. Plan requirements should not be additive. In other words, assume that contingencies and
OPLAN execution will not occur simultaneously.

25.3. For OPLAN taskings, munitions plan development will be a coordinated effort between the recep-
tion/beddown unit (provisional wing) and major deploying units. Units fighting in place and lead muni-
tions flights deploying to collocated operating bases (COBs) should address all the areas listed below.
Units deploying to main operating bases (MOBs) or units that are not the lead unit at COBs do not need
to address all areas below. They would use the MEP from the lead unit in developing their plan.

25.4. Chapter development starts with performing a thorough and comprehensive initial site survey. For
someone else to address munitions matters instead of a munitions expert requires that person to be knowl-
edgeable in areas that take years of experience to acquire. Surveys are not just a one-time effort either.
Annual visits to the beddown location are a necessity, especially if newly assigned personnel are involved.
Insist that a knowledgeable munitions NCO/Officer accompany the survey team, it will benefit all con-
cerned. It is essential for the munitions IGESP OPR to coordinate with applicable base agencies to ensure
required support will take place, and that this support requirement is cross referenced in their respective
portions of the IGESP/ESP. If a site survey is not possible due to the sensitivity of location, the Contin-
gency Reference Book and Ground Logistics Study contain valuable data for writing the MEP. These doc-
uments are available at wing intelligence (IN) offices, worldwide.

25.5. Part One of the chapter should detail the resources available to support contingency taskings. These
resources include in-place assets (to include serviceable WRM) and resources provided through TPFDD,
host nation, and/or other services. Part Two describes concept of operations to meet required taskings and
appraisal of the unit's ability to fulfill those taskings. Format of the chapter will be at local discretion, but
should emphasize ease of use and clarity. The guidelines listed below should give the planner ideas for the
areas to consider when developing the chapter. Only include applicable areas of concern in the plan. How-
ever, do not forget to consider the needs of deploying units when addressing areas of concern.

25.6. State the purpose of this chapter and reference other supporting plans. For example, this plan defines
the munitions capabilities available at this location. State the specific mission of your organization. This
summary should give military decision makers a brief synopsis of your capabilities based on information
available at the time of preparation.

25.7. Describe munitions support capability, restrictions, and procedures. Include:

   25.7.1. Facilities. List location, type, size, explosives hazard classifications and limitations for each
   hazard classification, utilities available, and other relevant statistics about each storage, maintenance,
   and buildup facility. Describe whether these facilities provide complete overhead cover (contamina-
   tion avoidance measure for NBC environments), partial overhead cover, and to what degree they have
   been provided hardening from conventional munitions effects. Also include information about load-
   ing docks and hot cargo pad for incoming munitions shipments.

   25.7.2. Describe security systems and procedures for both munitions storage area and flightline deliv-
   ery locations. Describe security requirements and responsibilities associated with the control and pro-
   tection of resources, i.e., define responsibilities for perimeter defense of the munitions storage area
   (MSA), entry control, armed escort for off-base and possibly on-base munitions movements, etc.

   25.7.3. War reserve assets currently available.

   25.7.4. Delivery Routes. This section describes the on-base and off-base delivery routes used to trans-
   port munitions between different areas. Areas for discussion should include primary and alternate
   delivery routes between the MSA and aircraft parking ramp or hardened aircraft shelters (HAS), MSA
   and hot cargo pad, and MSA to holding areas (if any), etc. Include road hazards, load limitations,
   bridge locations, etc. This is vital information to know when transporting munitions.

   25.7.5. List available handling equipment and vehicles by type and quantity. Include WRM vehicles
   in deep storage identified for munitions flight use.

   25.7.6. Available test equipment for precision guided munitions. Identify resources to include tools,
   equipment, benchstock, technical data, publications, etc., required to support munitions operations.

   25.7.7. Available special tools for build-up operations

   25.7.8. List required personnel by skill level and assess unit capabilities by comparing the requirement
   with the in-place and/or TPFDD resources. Provide overall personnel requirements for the munitions
   operations to be performed. Include augmentees and their intended use. Match in-place and deploying
   personnel against requirements. For deploying personnel, use the Manpower Force Packaging Sys-
   tem, derived from the Contingency Operation/Mobility Planning and Execution system (COMPES),
   to identify skill level and functional account code.

   25.7.9. Identify communication capabilities and radio frequencies. Include location of Combat
   Ammunition System - Base (CAS-B) terminals if CAS is to be used for reporting purposes. If CAS-B
   is not used list available computers that can support CAS-Deployable operation.

   25.7.10. Describe any unique characteristics of the munitions storage area.

       25.7.10.1. Terrain Conditions. Identify the different conditions anticipated, what their effects
       might be on operations, and other precautions to be taken.

      25.7.11. Provide maps or drawings of munitions areas, delivery routes, etc.

         25.7.11.1. Designate the safest possible primary and alternate explosives movement routes to
         cover all phases of movement.

         25.7.11.2. Identify routes and any limitations on explosives quantities by hazard class/division in
         base publications. Avoid built-up areas and key, mission-oriented facilities and equipment to the
         maximum extent possible.

      25.7.12. Describe safety requirements and tasks necessary to support mission accomplishment. Since
      most operations are under combat conditions, it’s essential that all safety aspects of the operation be
      identified and controlled as much as possible. Safety awareness will help reduce accidental injury to
      personnel and loss of other resources.

         25.7.12.1. Use AF Operational Risk Management and AF Explosives Standards in planning to
         help the commanders make informed decisions on the proper mix of combat readiness and safety.

      25.7.13. Delineate Quantity-Distance (Q-D) requirements, and when an operation is incompatible
      (i.e., Q-D) with explosive safety standards, perform a thorough risk analysis and ensure appropriate
      compensatory measures are implemented. Initiate waiver procedures when necessary.

PART TWO:

25.8. In coordination with the Logistics Group Commander, describe how operations will be accom-
plished. Include:

      25.8.1. Tasked Organizations. List the organizations that support this MEP. The TPFDD identifies
      tasked units, where they are going, when they need to be there, etc. The planner should review the
      required UTCs and provide extracts to document types of equipment, quantities, earliest arrival date
      (EAD) and latest arrival date (LAD).

      25.8.2. Force Requirements. Identify the PAA supported, including deployed units.

      25.8.3. Describe procedures for integrating incoming munitions forces.

      25.8.4. Pre-conflict Measures. Include responsibilities the munitions OIC/NCOIC must initiate upon
      notification of plan implementation. Ensure this information is included in Chapter 4, Pre-Conflict
      Measures or reference this chapter as appropriate.

      25.8.5. Key Assumptions. List key assumptions essential to make this plan successful. Consider avail-
      ability of prepositioned assets, access to operational facilities, communications requirements, config-
      uration of deploying aircraft, likely threat environment, availability of protective structures and
      equipment, etc.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                       139


  25.8.6. Operational Constraints. Constraints include restrictions that might affect the outcome of the
  operation. Describe those essential issues that are unresolvable at unit level and ensure they are
  included in the unit LIMFAC report. For example, if ammo modules are not available for F-16 reload-
  ing operations, aircraft turnaround times may exceed established time requirements and ultimately
  affect the Integrated Tasking Order (ITO).

  25.8.7. Time To Commence Effective Operations. Describe significant events that must happen before
  operations can begin at the employment location. If personnel must arrive before aircraft to begin
  buildup operations or if deployed aircraft must regenerate within a certain time after arrival at the
  employment location, note this here.

  25.8.8. Munitions Flight Command Relationships. Who is in charge and who reports to whom? Note
  the chain-of-command between the different deploying units at the employment location and within
  your own unit.

  25.8.9. Munitions Requirements. Total munitions requirements must be known before sound planning
  can take place. The War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO), Annex D, Appendix 6 of
  OPLANs, and the unit pre-ITO, and Combat Ammunition System (CAS) reports contain information
  on consumable requirements. These documents outline munitions that are to be prepositioned, assem-
  bled into a combat configuration, or shipped, as well as received, at designated times , and provide
  estimated daily consumption charts. Coordination with OG and LG plans functions is essential in this
  area.

     25.8.9.1. Munitions operations will identify all munitions programmed by OPLAN tasking for
     shipment or receipt to the Base WRM and Transportation Officers. The munitions operations
     function will assist the Chief of Logistics Plans in preparing appendices for WRM munitions out-
     loading and receiving for munitions identified by OPLAN for shipment or receipt.

     25.8.9.2. Units will assure munitions shipping/receiving capability in the event communications
     are out (comm-out). Should the MAJCOM Ammunition Control Point (ACP) be unreachable,
     shipping units will confirm outload requirements with their NAF. If a "comm-out" situation exists
     with all headquarters, the shipping/receiving units will take the initiative to establish communica-
     tions and confirm outload capability prior to execution of the shipment. All modes of communica-
     tion will be considered in a "comm-out" situation, to include such means as DSN, commercial
     telecon or telegram, MARS, SSB radio, USN radio links, and physical relays by courier.

     25.8.9.3. In a "comm-out" condition to all headquarters, shipping units will process munitions as
     specified in the most current TPFDD or as requested by the receiving unit once communications
     are reestablished.

     25.8.9.4. Units storing War Reserve Supplies for Allies (WRSA) items will take into consideration
     the amount of WRSA munitions to be moved when assessing the units capability to ship and
     receive assets. WRSA movements have to be included in any concept of operation for munitions
     movements.
140                                                                AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


      25.8.10. Munitions Control Concept of Operations. Describe how munitions control will direct opera-
      tions, also how and what information will be upchanneled to them. Include:

         25.8.10.1. Personnel. Quantify the number of people to perform the operation.

         25.8.10.2. Duties. Describe specific duties.

         25.8.10.3. Facility Layout. The planner should make every effort to obtain/provide detailed draw-
         ings or photographs with accurate dimensions. Hand sketches will suffice if more accurate draw-
         ings can’t be obtained during the site survey.

         25.8.10.4. Shift Schedule. Identify the number of personnel assigned to each shift.

         25.8.10.5. Other. Identify other important areas not mentioned above.

      25.8.11. Storage Breakout Concept of Operations. Describe the plan for initial breakout of munitions
      for build-up sites and how these sites will be resupplied. Tasks to consider include prioritized breakout
      scheme, equipment utilization priorities, in/out shipment operations, production area resupply, and
      residue removal and disposition (shipment of reusable containers, dispose of or maintain for repack of
      unserviceable and/or unused munitions during recovery/redeployment, etc.). Specifically address

         25.8.11.1. Personnel. Quantify the number of people to perform the operation.

         25.8.11.2. Resources. Lists tools and support equipment, vehicles, technical data and publications,
         etc., needed to perform the operation. If the threat warrants, estimate the amount of barrier materi-
         als (plastic sheeting, tarps, etc.) to accomplish CB contamination avoidance measures for these
         resources. The normal planning factor would be for 5 covers per asset.

         25.8.11.3. Duties. Describe specific duties.

         25.8.11.4. Storage Area Layout. Show location of storage structures and build-up sites.

         25.8.11.6. Other. Identify other important areas not mentioned above.

      25.8.12. Munitions Build-up Concept of Operations. Describe the plan for assembly of munitions.
      Describe the concept of operations for each location if several build-up sites will be used. Include:

         25.8.12.1. Personnel. Quantify the number of people to perform the operation.

         25.8.12.2. Resources. Lists tools and support equipment, vehicles, technical data/publications,
         etc., needed to perform the operation. If the threat warrants, estimate the amount of barrier materi-
         als (plastic sheeting, tarps, etc.) to accomplish CB contamination avoidance measures for these
         resources. The normal planning factor would be for 5 covers per asset.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                        141


     25.8.12.3. Duties. Describe specific duties.

     25.8.12.4. Facility Layout. The planner should make every effort to obtain/provide detailed draw-
     ings or photographs with accurate dimensions. Hand sketches will suffice if more accurate draw-
     ings can’t be obtained during the site survey

     25.8.12.5. Production Rate. Quantify the number of munitions that can be assembled per hour for
     a 24 hour period to support the expected sortie rate. Identify crew size to accomplish this.

     25.8.12.6. Shift Schedule. Identify the number of personnel assigned to each shift.

     25.8.12.7. Other. Identify other important areas not mentioned above.

  25.8.13. Munitions Delivery Concept of Operations. Describe the plan for delivery of munitions to
  aircraft locations. Include:

     25.8.13.1. Personnel. Quantify the number of people to perform the operation.

     25.8.13.2. Resources. Lists tools and support equipment, vehicles, technical data/publications,
     etc., needed to perform the operation. If the threat warrants, estimate the amount of barrier materi-
     als (plastic sheeting, tarps, etc.) to accomplish CB contamination avoidance measures for these
     resources. The normal planning factor would be for 5 covers per asset.

     25.8.13.3. Duties. Describe specific duties.

     25.8.13.4. Aircraft parking location layout. Show the location of aircraft parking spots in relation
     to the munitions storage area and munitions delivery routes.

     25.8.13.5. Shift Schedule. Identify the number of personnel assigned to each shift.

     25.8.13.6. Other. Identify other important areas not mentioned above.

  25.8.14. Munitions Accountability. Munitions accountability procedures must be an integral part of
  combat munitions production. This will facilitate consistent and accurate munitions stockpile man-
  agement and enhance the unit’s combat sortie generation capabilities. Timely upchanneled stockpile
  reports will effect distribution and resupply actions by MAJCOM. Incorporate into this section the
  local accountability and reporting procedures that the munitions organization will use. Existing direc-
  tives (AFI 21-201, AFMAN 10-206, MAJCOM procedures) reflect procedures for accountability.

  25.8.15. Munitions Resupply. This section should contain data concerning specific resupply details,
  such as arrival date, method of arrival, quantities, etc. Some things to consider are:

     25.8.15.1. WRM movement requirements. Determine incoming and outgoing munitions ship-
     ments required by TPFDD tasking.
142                                                                AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


         25.8.15.2. What is the theater concept of munitions resupply (see theater CINCs OPLAN, CON-
         PLAN, etc.,)?

         25.8.15.3. How will munitions resupply occur (by what mode)? Identify responsibilities for move-
         ment of munitions after delivery.

      25.8.16. Residue Disposal. Munitions packing residue, empty containers, and extra bits/pieces accu-
      mulated after buildup operations are complete need to be collected and disposed of to preclude a
      safety hazard or hindrance to the operation. There may be a requirement to preserve some of this
      material to repack unused munitions or for some other use. List responsibilities and procedures for
      residue disposal. Chemically-contaminated Waste Disposal. Munitions personnel must clearly mark
      and separate all contaminated waste materials from other waste. Determine where the temporary
      waste disposal site(s) will be, the location of the permanent contaminated waste disposal site, the time
      period or stock level for placing materials in the temporary waste disposal site, and the mechanism to
      transport the assets from the temporary to the permanent contaminated waste disposal site. The site
      should be at least 50 feet from occupied munitions facilities or work positions if possible. Further
      details for contaminated waste disposal are included in AFMAN 10-2602, Attachment 4.

      25.8.17. Emergency Destruction of Munitions. Emergency destruction of munitions (EDM) is the
      final action taken to ensure assigned munitions and materials do not fall into the hands of unautho-
      rized forces. This section should identify responsibilities and describe procedures on how to destroy
      munitions if an emergency arises. (If a separate EDM plan is available it can be included in the MEP
      in place of rewriting it for this section.)

         25.8.17.1. Responsibilities. Identify responsibilities.

         25.8.17.2. Support. Identify and coordinate requirements for other agencies, like security forces
         and EOD, tasked to provide support.

         25.8.17.3. Resources. Identify equipment, personnel and demolition material needed to support
         EDM. Is explosive material for EDM on hand or will it be sent through resupply channels?

         25.8.17.4. Safety Briefing. Identify safety aspects of each operation.

         25.8.17.5. Destruction Location. Identify where assets will be destroyed.

         25.8.17.6. Storage Location. Identify locations of demolition materials.

         25.8.17.7. Destruction Methods. Identify methods used to destroy munitions and materials.

         25.8.17.8. Other.

      25.8.18. Logistics Appraisal. State logistics limitations that could impede implementation of this plan.
      Availability of assets (both at home base and deployed location) should be considered. Logistical
      problems concerning munitions resupply operations, if anticipated, should be mentioned.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                           143


   25.8.19. Personnel Appraisal. Note personnel limitations.

   25.8.20. Supply Distribution. Identify supply requirements, source and distribution procedures rele-
   vant to munitions operations. Note if initial support is from Mobile Readiness Spares Package
   (MRSP), prepositioned assets, or host-nation support. Identify requirements for common consumable
   supply requirements such as, banding materials, nails, dunnage and tie-down equipment.

   25.8.21. Fuels Distribution. Identify fuel requirements (jet fuel, mogas, and diesel), sources and distri-
   bution procedures. All fuel for aerospace ground equipment (AGE) and vehicles must be identified
   and coordinated with the fuels management flight during the planning phase to ensure availability of
   assets.

25.8.22. Transportation. Note transportation requirements, sources, distribution, and maintenance and
control procedures not covered elsewhere. Compute additional vehicle requirements considering on-hand
vehicle fleet, as well as any WRM vehicles assigned to your unit. Provide requirements to the Transporta-
tion Function by vehicle type, number currently authorized for peacetime operation, number currently
assigned, and number required to support OPLAN requirements. Coordinate with the Transportation
Function to ensure completeness before the Transportation Function consolidation of wing requirements
in the Transportation Chapter of the IGESP. All subsequent changes of vehicle authorizations, including
WRM vehicles, must have the Transportation Function approval prior to inclusion in the IGESP. Muni-
tions vehicle requirements are included in the Transportation chapter of the IGESP. Identify procedures
for repair of high use equipment such as forklifts and tow vehicles.

   25.8.23. Communications and Information Requirements: Identify any communications and informa-
   tion requirements beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for considerations include: basic
   phone services, computers, networking capabilities (classified and unclassified), secure phone instru-
   ments, LMRs and/or pagers, secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing capabilities. Con-
   sider the effectiveness of the installation warning and reporting network within the on-base munitions
   area and at any off-base munitions storage sites. Ensure any LIMFACs in this area are highlighted at
   the installation WOC and in reports to higher headquarters. Coordinate with installation Communica-
   tions Officer prior to consolidation of requirements into Base Support Plan. Insure these requirements
   are addressed in Chapter 28.

   25.8.24. Camouflage, Concealment, And Deception (CCD). Commensurate with the threat, and with
   the assistance of Security Forces and CE Readiness personnel, identify the resources that require CCD
   and the optimum CCD techniques available for their protection. This may include netting buildings or
   vehicles, application of tonedown paint to blend equipment with the terrain, or disguising potential
   targets...the possibilities are numerous. If CCD materials and techniques are determined to be neces-
   sary, ensure checklists and local post-attack response procedures are modified to indicate that chemi-
   cal agents will remain a contact hazard on these materials for an extended period of time (up to 24
   hours).

   25.8.25. Dispersal. Efforts to disperse assets will force the enemy to strike in different places to com-
   pletely destroy all intended targets. Provide procedures for dispersal of munitions, support equipment,
   vehicles, and personnel.
144                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


      25.8.26. Decontamination. Decontamination is associated with base recovery operations and must be
      an expeditious process for removing contaminated material (chemical or radioactive) from those
      assets needed to continue operations. Identify responsibilities, resources, and post-attack procedures
      to support the mission.

      25.8.27. Maps, photographs, drawings, etc., should be maintained as support data. These maps should
      identify locations of the MSA, storage structures, convoy routes, aircraft parking ramp, and other
      important areas for the planner to develop an effective plan. If maps or photographs don’t exist or are
      unavailable, make drawings to add support for the requirement.

      25.8.28. References. List references for determining required resources (deployment manning docu-
      ment, tables of allowance, vehicle authorization lists, etc.).

25.8.29. LIMFACs/Shortfalls. Consolidate all shortfalls and limiting factors in this section and outline
efforts to resolve them. Number and assign each LIMFAC an office of primary responsibility (OPR),
point of contact (POC), estimated completion date (ECD), impact assessment and work around. After
identifying LIMFACs or shortfalls submit them to logistics plans for review by the IGESPC.

               CHAPTER 26 - MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL OFFICE


This chapter will describe to your augmenting forces what your capabilities are and the requirements
expected of them during a contingency or war. Basic capabilities and general operating procedures are
outlined in Part One. OPLAN-specific capabilities and operating procedures are contained in Part Two.
This is one of the most important documents you will be involved with concerning wartime planning.
Properly completed, it will be a resource document to assist you.

PART ONE:

26.1. Summarize existing capabilities.

   26.1.1. Facility location(s), size, phone numbers, etc.

   26.1.2. The type and number of communication lines. Also, include any special communication capa-
   bilities and degree of access (limited, moderate or unlimited) to GCCS, AFMEA BBS, PDS, DCPDS,
   etc.

   26.1.3. The type and number of vehicles.

PART TWO:

26.2. Summarize how the capabilities listed in Part One will be used at OPLAN execution.

26.3. Summarize the military and civilian personnel office mission during OPLAN execution.

   26.3.1. Include number of Emergency Essential civilian positions and employees available during
   contingency/wartime OPLAN execution.

26.4. List any assumptions you have which impact your ability to support the wing mission during
OPLAN execution. Include assumptions concerning Local National civilian employees during contin-
gency/wartime operations.

26.5. Summarize and chart organizational command control relationships existing under OPLAN execu-
tion.

26.6. Personnel support for contingency operations (PERSCO). Review OPLAN taskings to best position
parent and augmentation teams, identifying redundant requirements. Consolidate as needed.

   26.6.1. Map team locations and available facilities.
146                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


      26.6.2. Outline plan for PERSCO transition for accountability/casualty reporting into traditional per-
      sonnel program (assignments, promotions, etc.) support.

      26.6.3. Detail coordination procedures between parent stand-alone teams and any augmenting geo-
      graphically separated teams. Include needed communications and power support requirements.

      26.6.4. Establish manual procedures to accomplish PERSCO automated processes.

      26.6.5. Provide a security plan for equipment and data. Include emergency destruction procedures.

26.7. Prepare a concept to account for evacuees during operations for NEO and Repatriation. (Ref AFI
10-216) (During these operations “Personnel” is only responsible for the accountability for the evacuees -
not the entire process. NEO and Repatriation comes under operations and should be part of a base plan
that outlines how all agencies, of which “Personnel” is a small part, will support these efforts. This should
be part of the XO attachment).

26.8. Outline procedures for processing of formerly captured, missing, and detained US personnel. The
health, welfare, and morale of returned US personnel are of prime importance. All reasonable efforts will
be made to provide for their personal, psychological, and spiritual needs. Returned US personnel will be
placed in medical channels as soon as possible. (Ref AFI 10-401, JCSM 136-91 and WMP1, Annex G,
Appendix 6)

      26.8.1. Processing time for returnees will be kept to a minimum consistent with their physical condi-
      tion, the availability of transportation, and other operational considerations.

26.9. Contact your unit plans function to determine OPLAN taskings for your unit. From that OPLAN's
Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD), list numbers of personnel deploying to (and from)
your unit (include Unit Type Code (UTC) and Required Delivery Date (RDD)). Identify any special fac-
tors (requirements, formulas, etc.) you used in determining or assessing capabilities and requirements.

26.10. Provide detailed tasks for the personnel management organization. This section should identify and
justify wartime tasks which places additional requirements on your unit and may require additional mate-
rial and facilities to accomplish the mission. Identify on-hand material and facilities and additional
requirements.

26.11. Compute required equipment and supply items based on total numbers of personnel expected to
deploy to support your operations (less on-hand items at your unit identified in Part One which may be
used during the operation).

26.12. Consider if the current unit facility is adequate for the additional personnel arriving and indicate
any additional requirements.

26.13. Develop a detailed plan for participating in the reception of and the accountability for forces
received at your location. The plan should include the process of accounting for those forces at your loca-
tion temporarily; i.e., passing through enroute to other locations.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                       147


26.14. Communications and Information. Identify any communications and information requirements
beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for considerations include: basic phone services, comput-
ers, networking capabilities (classified and unclassified), secure phone instruments, LMRs and/or pagers,
secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing capabilities. Coordinate with installation Communi-
cations Officer prior to consolidation of requirements into Base Support Plan. Insure these requirements
are addressed in Chapter 28.

26.15. Compute additional vehicle requirements considering on-hand vehicle fleet, as well as any WRM
vehicles assigned to your unit. Provide requirements to the Transportation Function by vehicle type, num-
ber currently authorized for peacetime operation, number currently assigned, and number required to sup-
port OPLAN requirements. Coordinate with the Transportation Function to ensure completeness prior to
the Transportation Function consolidation of wing requirements for publication into the Transportation
Chapter of the IGESP. The Transportation Function prior to inclusion in the IGESP must approve all sub-
sequent changes of vehicle authorizations, including WRM vehicles. Vehicle requirements are included in
the Transportation chapter of the IGESP.

26.16. After comparing your capabilities against your OPLAN requirements, identify any limiting factors
and submit them to logistics plans for review by the IGESPC.

outlines basic peacetime capabilities and general operating procedures. Part Two outlines OPLAN-spe-
cific (wartime) responsibilities and operating procedures, to include any deployment requirements.
Although "Manpower" guidance is provided here separately, it is very important to coordinate this chapter
with your local Military Personnel Flight. It is acceptable to consolidate your input in a combined "Man-
power and Personnel" chapter.

PART ONE:

27.1. Summarize existing capabilities.

27.2. Provide information regarding facility location(s): size, type and number of communication lines,
etc. Also include any special communication capabilities and degree of access (limited, moderate or
unlimited) to GCCS, AFMIA XPM website, Red Mini, secure telephone/modem/FAX, etc.

27.3. Identify available vehicles.

27.4. Outline your basic mission and how that mission supports the overall mission of the base.

PART TWO:

27.5. Summarize how the capabilities listed in PART ONE will be used to meet manpower related require-
ments outlined in the "Manpower & Personnel Annex" to the OPLAN (i.e.,, explain procedures to support
the Manpower and Personnel Readiness Unit (MPRU)). Outline concept of operations for Manpower and
Organization technicians deployed to other locations (e.g. COBs) (AFI 38-205). Describe integration of
Manpower and Organization technicians gained as part of deployed forces to your location. Also, include
any support to a NAF.

27.6. Outline the relationship which will exist between the Manpower and Organization Office and the
Personnel Readiness Unit (PRU) in meeting the manpower and personnel functional responsibilities
detailed in the OPLAN. For example, how will the Manpower and Personnel Readiness Unit (MPRU) be
manned and where will it be located. Show organizational structure. Address all locations where this rela-
tionship will exist.

27.7. List the type and number of manpower (CSFXX) UTCs (personnel and equipment) that can be gen-
erated or mobilized in support of the OPLAN.

27.8. List any assumptions you make impacting your ability to support the wing's mission (to include
deployments) during OPLAN execution. Also include any support you will provide in the form of aug-
mentees to other wing functions.

The installation chaplain will prepare this chapter. Identify policy and guidance to facilitate planning and
execution of a comprehensive Chaplain Service ministry during base support, operation site planning,
humanitarian relief operations, as well as, all levels of conflict in the area of operations (AO). These activ-
ities include being a visible reminder of the Holy; providing a pluralistic, pastoral, moral, religious, and
spiritual ministry to Air Force personnel in support of maximum Air Force combat effectiveness. Air
Force Chaplain Service personnel, operating as Chaplain Service Teams are essential in the combat area
to provide timely ministry to Air Force personnel facing the trauma of mass casualties, battle fatigue, and
other combat-related stress. These teams are needed in the AO to nurture the living, minister to casualties,
and honor the dead.

Air Force Chaplain Service personnel assist the commander in meeting the spiritual needs of Air Force
personnel by providing a comprehensive ministry. They are responsible for all religious activities, wor-
ship services, pastoral counseling, pastoral visitation, pastoral care, religious rites and providing ethical
leadership and advice to commanders. Air Force Chaplain Service personnel are responsible for ministry
to casualties, casualty care-givers, and other Air Force personnel, as well as personnel of component com-
mands who are integrated into Air Force units and separated from the moral and spiritual care of their
component Chaplain Service representative.

                                        CHAPTER 40 - SAFETY


This chapter is prepared by the Chief of Safety. In it, you will describe to your augmenting unit what your
capabilities are and the requirements expected of them during a contingency or war. Basic capabilities and
general operating procedures are outlined in Part One. OPLAN-specific capabilities and operating proce-
dures are contained in part Two. This is one of the most important documents you will be involved with
concerning wartime planning. Properly completed, it will be a resource document to assist you.

PART ONE:

40.1. Summarize how Safety supports the mission during any contingency, to include general policies,
procedures, and guidance.

40.2. Identify on hand materiel, facilities, and any other capabilities. Identify and advise the commander
of effect and impact to mission accomplishment during joint operations. Significant issues arise in the
joint environment which are not encountered in routine single-service operations, but which have a cumu-
lative effect with respect to risk. These include, but are not limited to, deployment problems (e.g., cargo
preparation and marshaling for airlift and sealift, ramp space allocation and aircraft surface movement
conflicts, establishment of quantity-distance limits for explosives and "hot cargo" areas at deployed loca-
tions); air traffic conflicts among participating forces and with civil aviation operations (saturation, partic-
ipating aircraft performance, terminology and language problems, block airspace for refueling operations,
etc.); and exposure to potential blue-on-blue fire (such as disconnects between rules of engagement, air
tasking order management, and even routine movements). In short, risk reduction, while naturally embed-
ded in the planning of day-to-day combat operations, must also be a separate concern and receive due
attention both during movement operations and upon establishment of deployed presence. Otherwise,
commanders stand to lose vital assets needed to accomplish their missions.

PART TWO:

40.3. Summarize the mission for your unit during OPLAN operations. Review support agreements to see
if safety requirements will increase or decrease and plan accordingly. Include policies, procedures, guid-
ance, and any changes in capabilities (decreased/increased services, resources, etc.) which may differ than
those identified in Part One. Assess risk for joint operations to include co-location bed-down of personnel
and weapons systems.

40.4. List any assumptions you have which impact on your ability to support the wing mission during
OPLAN execution.

40.5. Summarize organizational command control relationships existing under OPLAN execution.

40.6. Contact your unit plans function to determine OPLAN taskings for your unit. From that OPLAN's
Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD), list numbers of personnel deploying to (and from)
your unit (include Unit Type Code (UTC) and Required Delivery Date (RDD), and Limiting Factors
(LIMFACS)). Identify any special factors (requirements, formulas, etc.) you used in determining or
assessing capabilities and requirements.

40.7. List functional responsibilities that have a direct bearing on successfully providing safety support.

40.8. Provide detailed tasks. This section should identify and justify wartime tasks that place additional
requirements on your unit and may require additional material and facilities to accomplish the mission.

40.9. Risk Management. Define your functional role in risk management during the implementation phase
of this support plan. Specific attention should be placed on those operations with inherent risk. Include
explosive exceptions in the risk management. Assist other functional managers in the development and
identification of risk within all areas of the operation to include joint operations to include co-location
bed-down of personnel and weapons systems.

40.10. Mishap Reporting. Define mishap reporting procedures that will be in effect during implementa-
tion of this plan. Subsequent mishap investigations will be IAW AFI 91- 204, Investigating and Reporting
US Air Force Mishaps.

40.11. Explain/advise of any issues/operations that could impact on the successful implementation of the
OPLAN. Emphasis in risk management throughout the execution of the OPLAN should ensure mission
accomplishment with minimal resource loss.

40.12. Compute required equipment and supply items based on total numbers of Safety personnel
expected to deploy to support your operations (less on-hand items at your unit identified in Part One
which may be used during the operation).

40.13. Consider if the current unit facility is adequate for the additional personnel arriving and indicate
any additional requirements. Specify the need for secure work areas, including interview rooms and evi-
dence facilities.

40.14. Communications and Information. Identify any communications and information requirements
beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for considerations include: basic phone services, comput-
ers, networking capabilities (classified and unclassified), secure phone instruments, LMRs and/or pagers,
secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing capabilities. Coordinate with installation Communi-
cations Officer prior to consolidation of requirements into Base Support Plan. Insure these requirements
are addressed in Chapter 28.

40.15. Compute additional vehicle requirements considering on-hand vehicle fleet, as well as any WRM
vehicles assigned to your unit. Provide requirements to the Transportation Function by vehicle type, num-
ber currently authorized for peacetime operation, number currently assigned, and number required to sup-
port OPLAN requirements. Coordinate with the Transportation Function to ensure completeness prior to
the Transportation Function consolidation of wing requirements for publication into the Transportation
Chapter of the IGESP. The Transportation Function prior to inclusion in the IGESP must approve all sub-
182                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007

PART ONE:

44.1. Depict base areas and facilities that will be used to support the base contingency mission and show
all requirements for facilities and utilities. Generally describe the base layout and its location relative to
known geographic landmarks, for example, "XXXX Air Base is approximately 5 miles southwest of city,
(country). The base is serviced by major highway routes and is _____miles from the nearest railway."

44.2. Consolidate maps required by various functional activities. Include a general base layout and anno-
tate the following areas or facilities (lodging, dining, medical, maintenance, supply, munitions, utilities,
fuels storage and servicing, morgue and mass burial area, etc.). Identify NBCC area monitoring locations
on base grid maps and/or 1:50,000 scale maps.

44.3. These layouts will also portray the areas for emergency use when existing facilities are saturated.
Depicted should be such areas as emergency troop housing areas, aerial port and related areas, deploying
vehicle parking, aircraft parking, field kitchens, field hospital in relation to existing facilities, tent city
location, and other pertinent areas.

44.4. Utility layouts should reflect possible expansion of USAF and host nation lines. The use of layouts
and depiction of major functional building is encouraged. Generally, maps should show the layout of
functions to address the base missions in the base support plan. The maps should vary in scale so as to
depict the overall layout and specific areas.

44.5. On base maps will be available using 1”=400’ and 1”=800’ scale for crash recovery/response and
airfield maps will be available for damage plotting/minimum operating strip selection in the 1” = 100’
scale.

44.6. Maps should be documented by Civil Engineering representatives using standardized AutoCAD

      IC 2004-1 TO AFI 10-404, BASE SUPPORT AND EXPEDITIONARY SITE PLANNING
9 MARCH 2004
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2004-1. This change to AFI 10-404, Base Support and
Expeditionary Site Planning integrates the In-garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP) and the Expedi-
tionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) into the plan. The IGESP is primarily developed for locations with a
permanent Air Force presence, and is fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many func-
tional experts with a deliberate planning time line. IGESPs were formerly known as Base Support Plans
(BSPs). The ESSP improves our capability to effectively identify potential operational locations and col-
lect, store, and access site data in support of the warfighter decision-making process. This process will
provide decision-makers with standardized, substantive, and reliable site survey information essential to
successful mission accomplishment. Furthermore, standardization of the ESSP process will lead to a
greater understanding of responsibilities at all levels, and greatly improves our expeditionary capability.
A “|” indicates revised material since the last edition.
1.1. Objectives. The objectives of in-garrison expeditionary site plans (IGESP) and expeditionary site
planning (ESP) are to determine capabilities and apply them to contingency operations. The Expedition-
ary Site Survey Process (ESSP) is a subset of the overall expeditionary site planning process. Expedition-
ary site planning is the foundation for Air Force expeditionary operations; this AFI is the governing
document for the ESSP. It provides the focus, guidance, and integration, and prioritizes the actions for the
site survey teams. It provides the necessary detailed information required by planners at all levels--strate-
gic, operational, and tactical. Whether they are developing the Air Campaign, the aircraft basing plan sup-
porting the air campaign, or preparing to deploy a unit forward to execute the plan – each requires similar
information with which to begin planning. The primary difference between the three examples is the level
of detail required to execute their planning. The ESSP provides the expeditionary site planning process a
standard operational method for data collection and data storage for potential operating locations.
1.1.1. Part I of the in-garrison and expeditionary site plan identifies resources and capabilities of a loca-
tion by functional area and is the focus of the expeditionary site survey. For contingency requirements,
Part II of the plan allocates resources identified in Part I, assesses the ability to support the operation, and
identifies limiting factors (LIMFACs). It is through these plans that all units operating out of the location
become familiar with the existing resource allocations and key tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs).
1.1.2. The ESSP is a strategic vision that defines the site survey process in operational and tactical terms.
Air Force units and personnel should plan and execute site surveys by using the ESSP to plan employ-
ment, reception and beddown, employment, and sustainment of air and space expeditionary forces.
1.1.3. The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense (DOD) DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 estab-
lished the operational chain of command for the DOD from the President to the Secretary of Defense to
the combatant commanders. Title 10, United States Code 163, the Unified Command Plan (UCP) direct
that communications between the President/Secretary of Defense and the combatant commanders be
transmitted through the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). The commanders of combatant com-
mands exercise command authority (CoCom) of assigned forces and are directly responsible to the Presi-
dent and Secretary of Defense for the performance of assigned missions and preparedness of their
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                       199


commands. There are nine combatant commanders with five having geographic responsibilities. These
combatant commanders are each assigned an Area of Responsibility (AOR) by the UCP and are responsi-
ble for all operations within their designated areas; U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Central Command,
U.S. European Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Northern Command (includes Homeland
Defense). During wartime, the Commander of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), which is a subordinate com-
mand to USPACOM in peacetime, becomes the Commander, United Nations Command, and Commander
of the Republic of Korea (ROK)-U.S. Combined Forces Command. The other four combatant command-
ers have worldwide functional responsibilities not bounded by geography: U.S. Special Operations Com-
mand, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Transportation Command, and U.S. Joint Forces Command.
Assigned to each of these combatant commands is an Air Force component command. At the operational
level, the component command commander advocates air and space power, provides expertise and advice
to the combatant commander, and exercises day-to-day command authority over air and space forces.
Each Air Force component command will have a program office responsible for site survey planning and
execution. The responsible Air Force component command program office will work with Combatant
Commander planning staffs to develop a theater-wide Site Survey Priority List (SSPL). The program
office will also orchestrate the execution of site surveys in coordination with Air Mobility Command and
supporting agencies to ensure site data is collected, stored, and accessible worldwide in accordance with
the standardized ESSP defined by this AFI. Figure 1.1., Military Command Relationships, depicts the
chain of command that affects expeditionary site planning, the level of involvement (Strategic, Opera-
tional, or Tactical), and the command relationship between key players in the process.

1.2. Products. The expeditionary site planning process produces an In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan
(IGESP) and an Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP). IGESPs are primarily developed for locations with a per-
manent Air Force presence, and are fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many func-
tional experts with a deliberate planning time line. ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a
permanent Air Force presence and may contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial beddown
decisions (quick reaction site survey information in Part I). ESPs may be developed in short time frames
to meet contingency needs without full staffing or coordination. IGESPs and ESPs follow the format tem-
plates in the attachments to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning or the Survey Tool
for Employment Planning application. The new Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) defines the
capability and procedures to effectively identify potential operational locations and collect, store, and
access site data in support of warfighter decision-making processes. This process will provide deci-
sion-makers with substantive and reliable site survey information essential to performing their jobs well.
Furthermore, the standardization of the process will enable the process to move faster, lead to a greater
understanding of responsibilities at all levels, and a greatly improve the quality and usefulness of expedi-
tionary site planning data.
1.3. Processes. Agile combat support (ACS) is a core competency of the Air Force and includes the pro-
cesses that create, sustain, and protect all aerospace capabilities necessary to accomplish mission objec-
tives across the spectrum of conflict. It is the product of processes that ready the force, prepare the battle
space and position, employ, sustain, and recover the force. Expeditionary combat support (ECS) is the tai-
lored ACS capability deployed to expeditionary sites to provide for Aerospace Expeditionary Forces
(AEF) employed and engaged in operations. This capability is produced by rapidly deployable, tailored
forces executing ACS processes to beddown, employ, maintain, protect, and redeploy tactical components
of air and space power and production. As part of ACS and ECS, the expeditionary site planning process
defines capability, establishes resource allocation, and determines solutions to shortages/limitations. A
rigorous expeditionary site planning process is essential to determine contingency beddown locations,
deployment requirements, tailoring decisions, and resource allocations. Where existing capabilities fall
short of mission requirements, this process facilitates decisions for successfully sustaining the mission.
The process result is an IGESP/ESP that defines the information necessary for making beddown, recep-
tion, and deployment-planning decisions. The collaborative planning required by all functional areas to
create a coordinated/integrated ESP results in the maximum benefit of the process. At the unit level it rep-
resents a capability assessment and an employment plan for the tactical level. For MAJCOM/NAF/Air
Component staffs, it quantifies theater/AOR support capabilities at the operational level. At HQ USAF, it
presents service level data for strategic level planning and requirements determination.
1.3.1. This Air Force Instruction is the governing document for the ESSP. It provides the focus, guidance,
and integration, and prioritizes the actions for the site survey teams. It provides the necessary detailed
information required by planners at all levels--strategic, operational, and tactical.
1.4. Systems Support. The Logistician’s Contingency Assessment Tools (LOGCAT) is a NIPRNET/SIPR-
NET-based suite of standard systems tools that enables automated, employment-driven, agile combat sup-
port planning. LOGCAT supports the expeditionary site planning process by accurately and rapidly
identifying resources and combat support requirements at potential employment locations, providing bed-
down capability analysis and LIMFAC identification, and facilitating force tailoring decisions to reduce
the overall deployment footprint. LOGCAT consists of three components that are mandated for use when
they are available at all levels of command. LOGCAT users are required to obtain a LOGCAT NIPRNET/
SIPRNET user password from their MAJCOM office.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                            201


1.4.1. Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP). Partially automates the overall expeditionary site
planning process and standardizes IGESP/ESP products via a sophisticated, multimedia tool for the col-
lection of site data. STEP is designed for in-garrison or deployed configurations, and incorporates func-
tionally based checklists to methodically capture site survey data in a standardized formats. STEP
organizes survey data to facilitate beddown analysis and LIMFAC identification. STEP enables IGESP/
ESP development with separate Part I and Part II modules. STEP provides a Part I capability that facili-
tates Part II development. Use of STEP for developing IGESP/ESPs is mandatory. Units unable to use
STEP Part II for IGESP/ESPs (as a result of no SIPRNET connectivity or other reasons) must request a
waiver from HQ USAF/ILGD through the appropriate MAJCOM/LGX or equivalent. Waiver requests
should include, as a minimum, the reason why STEP cannot be used, resolution actions, get well date, and
temporary work-around solution.
1.4.2. Employment Knowledge Base (EKB). EKB is the LOGCAT database that stores all STEP-pro-
duced IGESPs and ESPs. It also contains National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) airfield data,
and other information critical to contingency beddown planning. LOGCAT users are to enter Part I data
via the NIPRNET only. Part I data on the classified network will be updated via the data synchronization
capability from the unclassified STEP. (WARNING) Never update Part I data while in the Part II (SIPR-
NET) portion of the EKB.
1.4.3. Beddown Capability Assessment Tool (BCAT). BCAT is a robust decision support tool for assess-
ing the extent to which base/site capabilities can support planned mission activities over a designated
period of time. BCAT processes data from multiple sources including the EKB (survey data captured
using STEP) to perform a day-to-day assessment by comparing mission requirements to site capabilities
for petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL), munitions, parking, lodging, meals, and to a limited extent, airlift
throughput. With information generated by the analysis, BCAT presents LIMFACs using various graphi-
cal and tabular presentation modes. From the results, planners can anticipate the future need for capabili-
ties and make informed decisions to mitigate LIMFACs. BCAT analysis supports IGESP Part II and ESP
development.
1.5. ESSP Enablers. Worldwide accessibility to data storage is possible and necessary for planning accu-
racy and risk analysis of intended expeditionary sites. Planners and surveyors must be able to take advan-
tage of the Department of Defense Communications network, the Global Command and Control System
(GCCS) and Global Combat Support System (GCSS) infrastructures. Data collected in the field must be
transported to data stores in time to support impending operations. Planners must have access to the most
current data to advise senior leaders on courses of action concerning expeditionary site selection. Data
sharing will eliminate redundancy in collection efforts and help in right sizing deploying forces.
1.6. Integrated Data Collection Tools and Equipment. Standardized tools are integral to effective collec-
tion, storage, and access of data gathered during a site survey. Collecting data accurately and reliably
requires site survey teams to use standardized tools to support the site survey process. Integrated data col-
lection tools and equipment are designed and utilized to collect tabular and geospatial data. The corner-
stone of these tools is the site survey checklist and its integration of tabular and geospatial data. The Wing
Commander-scanned certification page should be imported via multimedia into the General Site Informa-
tion Chapter. The responsible MAJCOM, in coordination with the appropriate Air Force Component, will
determine certification authority in cases where the wing/installation commander cannot be the Certifying
official; i.e., lead wing commander or air force component commander. The Air Force Component Com-
mander may delegate this responsibility. Other Site Survey Checklist data fields not included within the
LOGCAT system should be populated within the miscellaneous field. It is designed to prioritize func-
202                                                                AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


tional team member actions and facilitate the sharing of information while preventing duplication of
effort. Properly trained personnel will be able to utilize these tools to collect integrated site data. The stan-
dardized tools focus the team and optimize activities, especially when situation restrictions may limit time
available on the ground at the site. MAJCOMs or other higher headquarters must plan for and acquire the
equipment required by their site survey teams. The headquarters must ensure requirements are identified
and submitted as part of the United States Air Force Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for fund-
ing. Each site survey team will have its own equipment. Equipment should be compatible with current
expeditionary site planning standards. This equipment will include both functional area-unique and com-
mon equipment. Equipment must meet the following standards:
1.6.1. Equipment must comply with guidelines for preventing unauthorized transfer of technology
1.6.2. Equipment should be unclassified
1.6.3. Equipment must be transportable by commercial means
1.6.4. Equipment must fit in suitcase-sized carriers
2.1. General. This chapter describes functional area roles and responsibilities for the planning, prepara-
tion, and execution of the expeditionary site planning and survey processes. Both processes significantly
impact beddown and campaign plan decisions for all military branches. Consequently, roles and responsi-
bilities must be clearly defined and unambiguous. Therefore, it is important that each organization's role
is known and understood by all involved. The following cross-functional responsibilities touch many
organizations and agencies and depict the basic responsibilities of each level of command.
2.1.1. Cross-Functional Responsibilities for IGESP/ESP. The format for IGESP/ESP is by functional
chapters, and templates for each are included as attachments to this instruction. The table of contents of
this instruction specifies the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for each chapter. Functional OPRs are
responsible for ensuring the template includes the functional content necessary to meet expeditionary site
planning objectives.
2.1.2. Cross-Functional Responsibilities for Expeditionary Site Planning Standard Systems Applications.
The rule-based logic contained in BCAT or its replacement is derived from functional area policy, techni-
cal data, and subject matter expert experience – examples include aircraft parking space data, aircraft
refueling flow rates, meal consumption data, etc. The “electronic checklist” in STEP is derived from
widely used checklists and functional expert input. Functional area managers are responsible for keeping
BCAT rules and STEP data elements current through coordination with AF/ILGD, and the respective
MAJCOM and expeditionary site planning OPR as appropriate.
2.2. The Directorate of Logistics Readiness (HQ USAF/ILG). Responsible for the Air Force Expedition-
ary Site Survey Planning process, policy, and guidance.
2.2.1. Provides oversight of USAF contingency site survey process. Assist lead MAJCOMs efforts to
de-conflict competing site survey requirements/resources when necessary.
2.2.2. Exercises management control over the expeditionary site planning program to insure availability
of accurate and current data for contingency logistics planning. Perform quarterly review of EKB data for
currency based on scheduled MAJCOM actions for IGESP/ESP entries/updates. During the interim
period of LOGCAT fielding, assess data currency by coordinating quarterly with MAJCOMs that are
unable to use STEP and the EKB.

2.3. MAJCOM/Command Logistics Plans Function. Provides command policy and guidance for imple-
menting in-garrison expeditionary support (IGESP), and expeditionary site planning (ESP) concepts to
meet their specific missions.
2.3.1. Ensure all subordinate bases develop IGESP Part I. Coordination of this requirement with other ser-
vices may require service component agreements at MAJCOM level if the AF unit is a tenant a Sister Ser-
vice location.
2.3.2. Ensure subordinate bases with support/combat responsibilities (i.e. reception, throughput, training,
etc.) develop IGESP Part II. At locations where USAF is not the host component, coordination of this
requirement with other services may require service component agreements at MAJCOM level if the AF
unit is a tenant a Sister Service location.
2.3.3. To facilitate management control, maintain a roster of subordinate bases (including forward operat-
ing locations where USAF may or may not maintain a presence) that require either an IGESP or ESP. Fol-
low the format in Figure 2.1. (sort the locations based on the next activity date), classify appropriately,
and forward to HQ USAF/ILGD on a quarterly basis (end of Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct).
Figure 2.1. Sample IGESP/ESP MAJCOM Roster.




2.3.4. Identify a point of contact (POC) to HQ USAF/ILGD for all MAJCOM related expeditionary site
planning issues. The MAJCOM POC represents the respective MAJCOM at the LOGCAT FRB and is a
voting member.
2.3.5. Provide planning information to subordinate units (i.e., all forces time-phased force deployment
data (TPFDD), war consumables distribution objective (WCDO), war plans additive requirements report
(WPARR), vehicle authorization list (VAL), War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), etc.) and identify base-
line-planning data for IGESP/ESP development.
2.3.6. Develop a review process for IGESP/ESPs in coordination with the responsible numbered Air
Force (NAF). Request MAJCOM functional area support to provide plan inputs for those areas where
functional expertise does not exist within the subordinate unit or NAF. Where appropriate, coordinate
with host wing, host wing NAF, and host wing MAJCOM logistics plans agencies during review process.
Maximize LOGCAT applications to expedite and standardize overall review process.
2.3.7. Monitor subordinate unit limiting factor (LIMFAC) reports in coordination with the appropriate
NAF. Staff validated LIMFACs with appropriate MAJCOM/Command functional managers for resolu-
tion actions. As appropriate, coordinate resolution actions and prioritization of effort with MAJCOM
senior staff, and NAF. Maintain a database of LIMFAC status and issue resolution.
2.3.8. Develop policy for performing staff assistance visits (SAVs) with subordinate units as required. The
purpose of SAVs is to review the overall expeditionary site planning process, provide guidance, clarifica-
tion, and training. The SAV program should be executed in coordination with responsible NAFs.

2.3.9. Coordinate with MAJCOM Inspector General (IG) to ensure proper evaluation of in-garrison and
expeditionary site planning processes and products across all functional areas.
2.3.10. Manage all MAJCOM related aspects of fielding, using, and sustaining expeditionary site plan-
ning standard systems applications such as LOGCAT and or its replacement.
2.3.11. Provide oversight of MAJCOM contingency site survey processes. Develop policy to insure site
survey information is collected with STEP and stored in the EKB when possible. Avoid duplication of
effort, and ensure enough data is collected during site surveys to facilitate beddown analysis with BCAT
as appropriate. Assist AMC/A3 with the development and maintenance of the Site Survey Priority List
(SSPL) for near-term (two years) site surveys at locations that are most likely to be used for primary mis-
sions, humanitarian assistance operations, or unique MAJCOM/AOR requirements. SSPLs should be
developed in concert with supported commands, subordinate units, and contingency taskings. Update
SSPLs semiannually, classify as appropriate, and forwarded to HQ USAF/ILGD NLT 31 March and 30
September each year. MAJCOMs and Centers (AETC, AFMC, AFRC, and ANG) without an AOR
responsibility are exempt from the SSPL report.

2.3.12. Identify to subordinate NAF and wing logistics plans functions their roles and responsibilities in
meeting expeditionary site planning objectives.
2.3.13. Identify and resolve IGESP and ESP issues impacting other MAJCOM units, including Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve units with their respective MAJCOM logistics plans functions.
2.4.1. Inspector General (IG). Evaluate expeditionary site planning processes and products. Coordinate
with the MAJCOM expeditionary site planning OPR for evaluation guidelines and metrics.
2.4.4. Provide assistance and inputs for IGESP/ESP development when functional expertise is not resi-
dent at subordinate levels.
2.4.5. Further refine functional chapter and/or ESP requirements to reflect unique AOR and/or MAJCOM
necessities. Include these refinements in a MAJCOM instruction or supplement to this document.
2.5.1. Review AOR wartime and contingency requirements and identify all aircraft, personnel (to include
noncombatant evacuees and all services), and equipment competing for base resources. Review all other
planning efforts to include base operability actions, reception task force responsibilities, command and
control structures, facility and utility usage, security requirements, noncombatant evacuation planning (to
include Safe Haven operations), tenant planning involvement, and host-nation support.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                        205


2.5.2. Sponsor, host, and fund USAF participation in applicable IGESP and ESP conferences at USAF
beddown and en route support locations within their AORs. Specifically, ACC is responsible for SOUTH-
COM, JFCOM, and CENTCOM AORs, USAFE is responsible for EUCOM AOR, PACAF is responsible
for PACOM AOR, and responsible parent MAJCOMs for CONUS based installations. MAJCOMs may
delegate any or all of these responsibilities to subordinate NAF/wing within the AOR.
2.5.3. Facilitate the development of ESPs for beddown or support locations in their AOR that do not have
a major Air Force presence. All efforts will be made to develop ESPs with Parts I and II -- as a minimum,
develop the ESP Part I. When the host country severely restricts access to a location, the ESP should be
completed to the extent possible with ongoing efforts to complete the plan. Coordination of this require-
ment with other services may require service component agreements at MAJCOM or COMBATANT
COMMANDER level.
2.6. Other Air Force Component Command (MAJCOM/NAF in component role) Staff Functions. Provide
guidance and assistance as necessary for developing and/or reviewing IGESP/ESP functional chapters.
Coordinate all site survey requests with the MAJCOM logistics plans function and insure site survey
information is collected with STEP and stored in the EKB when possible.
2.7. Deploying Unit Commander. Coordinate all site survey requests with AOR and parent MAJCOM
logistics plans function. Review IGESP/ESPs for locations their units are tasked to deploy to or transit
through. Deploying unit commanders will coordinate with and advise the reception base or transit loca-
tion of unique support requirements, suggested changes, or other impacts on reception planning. Units are
encouraged to participate in site surveys or planning conferences at their deployment locations to coordi-
nate requirements and plan for the most effective use of resources. Every effort should be taken to accom-
plish ESP site surveys or planning conferences in conjunction with scheduled deployments and/or
exercise participation. These visits facilitate the development of viable IGESP/ESPs, and provide the
deploying units the opportunity to tailor their deployment packages to eliminate duplication and reduce
reception and transportation requirements.
2.8. Host Wing/Installation Commander. Ensure IGESP is developed and maintained as directed by the
MAJCOM. When delegated by MAJCOM, budgets to host representatives from major deploying units to
assist in development of Part II and subsequent refinements. Support the overall process through the
in-garrison expeditionary site planning committee (IGESPC). Coordinate all site survey requests with
MAJCOM logistics plans function. Retain final signature authority on IGESP documents and validation
authority on electronic information transmitted and stored in the EKB. Chair the Planning Committee.
2.9. The Installation Expeditionary Site Planning OPR (Host Wing Logistics Plans Function).
2.9.1. Develop and manage the installation expeditionary site planning program.
2.9.2. Manage the IGESP Limiting Factor (LIMFAC) reporting program. Forward LIMFACs that are val-
idated by IGESPC and approved by wing/installation commander to applicable NAF logistics plans func-
tion. NAFs will, in-turn, forward these reports to MAJCOM logistics plans function after NAF staff and
commander review/approval.
2.9.3. Schedule and manage IGESPC meetings and notify/invite the appropriate NAF/LGX or equivalent.
Publish minutes and ensure copies are provided to all base agencies, attendees, NAF, and higher head-
quarters.
2.9.4. Develop and present IGESP briefings as required.
206                                                               AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


2.9.6.1. IGESP functional OPRs (project officers in each major base staff function, organization, and
associate units with a war support function), and authorized LOGCAT users.
2.9.6.2. Copies of minutes of the last four IGESPC meetings and any applicable working group meetings
(or reference to location if minutes are classified).
2.9.6.4. Copy of the IGESP or reference to its location.
2.9.6.8. Miscellaneous (issues, lessons learned, message traffic, training slides, handbooks, and any com-
ments which would add to the understanding of the expeditionary site planning process).
2.9.6.9. IGESP/ESP POC appointment letter.
2.9.7. Develop and maintain local policy and procedures for implementation and usage of LOGCAT at
base level. Insure local certification and system administration requirements are addressed.
2.9.7.1. Coordinate with the local network security office for software installation authorization
2.9.7.2. Maintain a LOGCAT user account roster. Inform MAJCOM LOGCAT Super Planner when
access is no longer required (changed jobs, PCS, retire, etc.).
2.10. In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC). (See paragraph 3.3. for specifics)
The IGESPC is a deliberate planning body chaired by the wing commander. Its primary function is to
actively integrate the efforts of all base-level organizations involved in preparing an IGESP.
2.11. Wing/Base Level Units (Including Tenant Units). All commanders and functional area experts,
regardless of command, are responsible for development, management, and review of their portions of the
IGESP. IGESP chapter OPRs will maintain continuity books (see paragraph 2.9.6.) to ensure succeeding
personnel are aware of how the chapter was developed (include internal checklists, formulas used, etc.).
Coordinate all site survey requests with wing logistics plans function to prevent duplication of effort and
permit proper prioritization of requirements. Each unit on base will compare capabilities against contin-
gency requirements and identify those constraints having a critical negative effect on a base's war fighting
capability. These constraints will be reviewed by the unit commander and submitted to the logistics plans
function for review by the IGESPC. LIMFACs are personnel or materiel deficiencies, problems, or condi-
tions (validated by the IGESPC) that have a critical negative impact on the ability of a unit to perform its
wartime mission, and require the aid of higher headquarters to resolve. Units will monitor reported LIM-
FACs and submit updates should changes occur (e.g., LIMFAC becomes invalid, outdated, etc.). Con-
straints, which do not meet IGESP LIMFAC criteria, should be identified as such (e.g., constraint,
shortfall, etc.) and included in the plan.
2.12. Installation Exercise/Inspection Function. Wing IG or equivalent; establish a program in coopera-
tion with the installation logistics plans function to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the reception
and beddown process. Installations will conduct local reception and beddown exercises at the discretion
of their MAJCOM. Reception and beddown exercises can be combined with other local exercises at the
host commander’s discretion. Exercise scenarios should be based on real world expectations of simulta-
neous deployment, reception, beddown, and integration of forces. All IGESP participants should be
involved in building the exercise scenario. Exercise evaluation results will be included in the IGESPC
minutes.
2.13. ESSP Roles and Responsibilities. Individuals involved in the site survey process must understand
the relationships between the various organizations involved in the process and what unique function each
provides to its successful outcome.
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                         207

2.13.7.3. During deployment, the AEW determines the capability and sustainability of the site and com-
plete checklists for site’s ESP.
2.14. Site Survey Team Training. Education and training are critical to the success of this AFI. All Air
Force personnel will be educated on the expeditionary site survey process. Those who collect the data as
well as those who will use the data to plan operations or make decisions must understand the overall expe-
ditionary site survey process and how to exploit its capabilities to the advantage of the Air Force.
2.14.1. Personnel assigned to the site survey teams are recognized functional experts. However, while
each has the ability to view a site from that individual perspective, the team must be able to see the site
from the operational perspective – the overall organization, since they may or may not know how the site
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                          209


will be used. As a result and beyond AFSC or position-specific training, the Air Force must provide train-
ing courses for the team chief and site survey team. The team chief course is a senior-level course address-
ing the overall process and procedures, lessons learned from past operations, basic interaction with
foreign governments and military counterparts on behalf of the United States, the legal aspects of such sit-
uations, and the limitations and authorities of the team chief. The focus of the team course will be team
synergy – what each member brings to the team as an individual, and together, what the team can accom-
plish through careful planning and interaction.
2.14.2. All site survey team members, whether assigned to the initial site survey team or follow-on team
must be formally trained. Air Force leadership and individuals assigned in the planning community must
be educated as to what the ESSP is, what the site surveys provide, and how to leverage opportunities to
assist in expanding the data collection effort while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Ultimately, when
fully operational, the ESSP will provide access to an integrated process that is capable of addressing those
initial operational questions critical to planning air operations.
3.1. General. IGESP/ESP development is an ongoing process. The total base resources are identified in
Part I of the plan. Part II development generally follows the JCS planning cycle and publication of sup-
porting plans. The baseline planning data for IGESP/ESP development is (1) COMBATANT COM-
MANDER and supporting OPLANS and CONPLANS, (2) time-phased force deployment data (TPFDDs)
including all-service data, (3) wartime aircraft activity report (WAAR), (4) war reserve materiel (WRM)
authorization documents, and (5) contingency in place requirements.
3.2. Plan Timing. Units are required to update/rewrite IGESP/ESPs in conjunction with TPFDD updates,
when there has been significant change in the unit's support posture, or as directed by the MAJCOM
logistics plans function. As a minimum, the IGESP/ESPs Part I is to be updated annually, but not later
than one year from when it was last published. It is not intended to be updated as changes occur through-
out the year. The IGESP/ESP Part II should be completed no later than 90-days after release of updated
planning documents or as tasked by the MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will baseline the planning cycle by mes-
sage traffic to their units to compensate for the problem of different cycles for source documents. MAJ-
COMs will interface with supported joint commands to interpret other Services’ planned use of AF bases
as reflected in the TPFDD, or where USAF is designated host/executive agent for a location.
3.3. In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC). The IGESPC is the key to successful
expeditionary site planning and must function with senior leadership involvement. The IGESPC shall
meet annually or more often if necessary to maintain a current IGESP.
3.3.1. Primary members of the IGESPC are all wing staff agency chiefs, group commanders, squadron
commanders, and tenant unit commanders. On installations where a Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) is
located, the CPO will be on the IGESPC. This individual will ensure civilians are accounted for in the
IGESP when appropriate, satisfy the need for linkage between IGESPs and Emergency-Essential, Contin-
gency Essential, and Key personnel designations, and provide overall expertise in civilian personnel mat-
ters.
3.3.2. When directed to develop or update a Part II, and upon receipt of initial or updated planning data
the IGESPC will convene to disseminate information and establish timelines and requirements to com-
plete the Part II. The IGESPC will review contingency in-place requirements and other base-level plans
that describe contingency or wartime requirements and other in-garrison expeditionary site planning
efforts (e.g., installation deployment plan). Review wartime and other contingency requirements to iden-
tify all aircraft, personnel, (including noncombatant evacuees and all services) and equipment competing
210                                                              AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


for base resources. Reviews should include (but are not limited to) air base operability actions, reception
task force responsibilities, command and control structures, facility and utility usage, security require-
ments, noncombatant evacuation planning (including Safe Haven operations), and tenant in-garrison
expeditionary site planning involvement. The IGESPC should consider recommended changes and inputs
received from transiting and/or employing units for possible incorporation into the IGESP to include ten-
ant unit requirements. De-conflict requirements for competing resources. Validate and prioritize installa-
tion LIMFACs that affect force deployment, reception, employment, and overall mission
accomplishment.
3.4. Planning Conference/Site Survey. Ideally IGESP/ESPs are produced at the point of intended use by
the units expected to use them. A combined planning conference/site survey held at the employment loca-
tion with the lead wing and NAF participating is optimum for locations without permanently assigned
major air force units. This concept also works well at locations where there is a host Air Force unit, and
they expect significant incoming forces. A planning conference at the host unit location can bring together
like-functional representatives from the host and the major incoming units to facilitate resource alloca-
tion.
3.5. Plan Titles. ESPs and IGESPs have standardized titles. The title includes the base/site name and loca-
tion, and " IGESP 10-404-XX” with XX representing the year the IGESP or ESP is published. Examples:
       KUNSAN AB, ROK                  AL UDEID AB, QATAR
       IGESP 10-404-00                 ESP 10-404-01
3.6. Security Classification. IGESP/ESP Part I is normally unclassified and marked "For Official Use
Only." IGESP/ESP Part II is normally classified based on the OPLANS they support – classify Part II
according to derivative classification guidance. The IGESP and ESP may have separate unclassified and
classified sections, as well as restricted distribution of some sections, to allow the widest appropriate dis-
tribution. As a minimum, mark the plan "For Official Use Only."
3.7. Plan Approval. The wing/installation commander is usually the approval authority for the IGESP and
ESP and must sign the plan, any subsequent changes or updates, and the LIMFAC report. The responsible
MAJCOM in coordination with the appropriate NAF will determine approval authority in cases where the
wing/installation commander cannot be the approval authority; i.e., lead wing commander or air force
component commander can approve an IGESP or ESP for a site. The information contained within the
IGESP Part I, will be treated as FOUO and NOFRN. The commander’s approval of an electronic gener-
ated IGESP from the EKB will be documented in the miscellaneous folder, within the General Site Infor-
mation Section.
3.8. Plan Distribution. Once IGESPs and ESPs are approved, the publishing function (usually wing or
NAF logistics plans function) will generate a message to the MAJCOM and NAF logistics plans function,
and each major deploying unit notifying them of plan availability. Post the plan to the EKB, or when this
is not possible to a MAJCOM logistics plans function GCCS/SIPRNET WEB page. Air National Guard
and Air Force Reserve units should forward one copy of the IGESP to ANGRC/LGX or AFRC/LGX in
addition to any MAJCOM requirements. Specific benefits derived from good distribution and availability
of the IGESP/ESP include (1) in-depth review and consistent development of requirements; (2) tailored
deployment packages that eliminate duplication of resources available at the beddown location; and (3) a
common core of knowledge on planned reception actions to provide a smooth and rapid integration of
incoming forces. When appropriate, ensure the U.S. host nation representative has the opportunity view
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                          211


the IGESP/ESP. Be sure to coordinate this release with the appropriate Plans and Programs office prior to
release.
3.8.1. Upon receipt of draft, new or updated IGESP/ESPs, deploying units should accomplish a plan
review and provide recommended changes and comments back to the IGESP/ESP OPR. Direct corre-
spondence between deploying and reception units is encouraged; with courtesy copies of message traffic
to the respective MAJCOM and NAF logistics plans agencies as applicable.
4.1. Format. IGESP/ESPs currently use a two-part format. Part I outlines base/installation capabilities and
total resources. As a minimum, MAJCOMs will ensure units capture STEP blue field (BCAT) data ele-
ments in EKB Part I. MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring the complete in-garrison ESP is accessible
via the World Wide Web or AF Portal and is available to AF and sister service functionals. Part II depicts
contingency requirements and allocates resources identified in Part I, assesses the ability to support the
operation, and identifies limiting factors (LIMFACs). Until such time, units that cannot access the STEP
application should follow the format outlined in the attachments as much as possible. Deviations are
authorized where the information in the attachment does not apply. The process should result in a plan
with the complete range of information necessary to identify wartime requirements and procedures, and
the resources necessary to fulfill the requirements. In general, content should be detailed enough for a
newly assigned individual to understand what must be done and how to do it. This is especially true for
IGESP/ESPs in short tour areas and at bases without a major Air Force presence during peacetime.
4.2. Non-Air Force Support. Use applicable functional chapter to incorporate requirements for planned
Army, Navy, or Marine Corps unit beddown, or transit support. Completed SORs should be incorporated
in the functional chapters of the plan (Part II).
4.3. Specific Content Guidance. The functional chapter titles in STEP are the same as Attachment 1
through Attachment 44; however, data entry fields within the STEP chapters differ in some cases from
the narrative in the attachments. When necessary, the “notes” area in all STEP chapters can be used to
include any information not covered by a data entry field. Units are encouraged to develop operating
instructions, checklists, and other supporting documentation to aid in plan development and execution
and to address unique situations. When a Part II is required, a lead-in paragraph should establish why it is
being developed, i.e., for what OPLAN or contingency. Tenant unit equipment and resources should be
incorporated in the appropriate section of the plan (Parts I and II)
4.4. The Expeditionary Site Survey Process is a subset of the ESP process. It is composed of three primary
interactive sub processes. As shown in Figure 4.1., these are site selection, data collection, and storage
and access. Although inter-related, each sub process has its own distinct purpose.

Figure 4.1. Overview – ESSP Process.




4.4.1. Sub-Process 1: Site Selection. Site selection consists of two, interrelated processes based on when
a site is identified as a potential operating location. Air Force component command staffs will work with
Combatant Commanders and Air Mobility Command planners to assess operating locations in support of
the Combatant Commander planning directives such as the theater engagement plan. A site may be one of
several identified and prioritized on a list by the component command, IAW its site selection criteria, in
the pre-conflict period. It can also be identified as part of the course of action (COA) development phase
during crisis action planning. It is incumbent upon the component command to actively seek opportunities
to conduct site surveys in a deliberate planning mode. This process of early engagement will facilitate the
planning and execution process as well as facilitate relationships with country teams in those locations not
routinely visited by air force personnel.
4.4.2. Sub-process 2: Data collection. The data collection sub-process is the heart of the site survey pro-
cess. It is composed of three distinct components - pre-site survey, site survey, and post site survey as
illustrated in Figure 4.2. The pre-site survey consists of actions taken by the team before departing home
station for the site. Functional experts perform pre-site survey tasks such as research the selected site via
the Non-Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) or Secret Internet Protocol Router Network
(SIPRNET) or obtain prior surveys, and expeditionary site plans if available, obtain common installation
picture and other maps and imagery of the location, and contact the Air Force component command and
Combatant Command country teams for information and assistance as necessary. The site survey, which
consists of actions accomplished while the team is deployed to the location. When notified, the site team
deploys to a location to conduct the site survey. During the site survey the team obtains site-specific phys-
ical characteristics and site capability data. Additionally, the teams may be required to make basic assess-
ments regarding the site’s suitability for flight operations in support of any Air Force mission. The
standardized checklist will guide the site survey teams and planners to perform an operational assessment
of a site. Information collected during the site visit is stored and subsequently analyzed to generate four

primary products for use by planners during the post-site survey phase--airfield suitability assessment,
full spectrum threat assessment, pavement evaluation, and an initial beddown assessment. The post-site
survey phase consists of actions taken by the team after departing the survey location. During this phase
actions would include updating an integrated framework and further development of an integrated CIP
using ESM capabilities. Teams may be required to generate written reports as necessary to meet theater
requirements. In-depth feasibility assessments may be accomplished during the post-site survey time-
frame to ascertain the most effective mission type for the site. Analysis and information generated by an
assigned mission by functional experts determine the long-term capability of a site’s supportability. This
analysis identifies what additional items and personnel are required to execute and sustain a mission, i.e.
the generation of in-to-plane contracts for fuel support or the development of an acquisition cross-servic-
ing agreement with the host-nation.
Figure 4.2. Data collection Sub-Process.




Determining that an airfield is capable of supporting flight operations is paramount to successful accom-
plishment of a site survey. Appropriate MAJCOM Director of Operations staff will perform an assess-
ment on the Site Survey Team’s Airfield Suitability Survey data and approve or disapprove the site for
their MAJCOM specific air operations. The assessment procedure (Figure 4.3.) is typical across the
MAJCOMs and addresses all Air Force aircraft and the full spectrum of operational missions. Decisions
for potential use will be made available to the warfighter with notes on which specific aircraft can operate
from the FOL, limitations, and other appropriate comments. Additionally, decisions not to use the site for
future operations based on the airfield suitability assessment will be identified.

4.4.3. Sub-Process 3: Storage And Access. Data Storage and Access: Storage of data, and access to the
data, by authorized personnel is paramount to advancing the site survey process. Data collected by the site
survey teams must be managed in a fashion that allows data sharing opportunities, provides methods for
easy yet secure access, and rapid analysis. The methodology for building data communications or infor-
mation technology (IT) systems is well defined by the DOD and the Air Force. The DOD and the Air
Force have established direction in the form of policies, guidance, and standards for the acquisition and
implementation of IT systems. All IT systems are designed on a specific architecture that includes an Inte-
grated Framework. The Integrated Framework is comprised of layers; Tech Services, Integration Ser-
vices, and Infrastructure. The Tech Services layer is the only layer of the integrated framework that most
customers of site survey data will reference. The components of the Tech Services layer provide the stor-
age of, and access to data. The Web Services component will provide web pages with integrated applica-
tions allowing users to search (query) databases for site information and then deliver the results of the
search in predefined reports or user-defined (ad-hoc) reports. Links to archives and archive search engines
will also provide users with information not typically stored in databases (e.g., after-action and les-
sons-learned reports). The goal of the Web Services component is to become the one-stop shopping point,
or Web broker, of site survey data. Other components of the Tech Services layer address, security, load
balancing of customers accessing Web Services, and databases. The ESSP Program Manager must contin-
uously search for opportunities to enhance data management by seeking out and collaborating with Pro-
gram Managers of systems that store site information. Data sharing between databases must be examined
and established to minimize duplication of data stores and collection efforts.

Chapter 5
CONTINGENCY/ESSP SITE SURVEY
5.1. General. AFI 10-503, Base Unit Beddown Procedures, implements AFPD 10-5, Basing, and provides
guidance for conducting site surveys for permanent beddown of a unit or mission on real property. It is not
applicable to site surveys for determining locations to support survival recovery and reconstitution plans,
exercises, and contingencies. This AFI sets policy for conducting these types of site surveys that are col-
lectively termed contingency site surveys. In the context of expeditionary site planning, a site survey is
defined as the physical investigation of a location to gather data in support of a planned or possible con-
tingency operation. Site surveys are conducted for any or all of the following purposes: (1) To determine
the feasibility of a location for planned operations; (2) To validate information about equipment, terrain,
host nation resources, and infrastructure such as serviceability, availability, compatibility, etc. (3) To
gather critical information for future operations and facilitate planning for the eventual use of a location.
5.2. Concept. Site surveys are an integral part of the expeditionary site planning process. Information
gathered during a survey on a site’s resources and capabilities are captured in the ESP Part I, and an anal-
ysis of the information facilitates resource allocation in Part II of the plan.
5.2.1. Site surveys are accomplished during deliberate and crisis action planning. In both circumstances
enough information must be collected to avoid the need for repeat visits. The survey tool for employment
planning (STEP) is designed to capture site information by functional category. STEP has two modes or
electronic checklists for gathering data – a full detailed checklist designed for fully staffed survey teams
with adequate time for a complete survey (deliberate planning), and a shortened quick reaction site survey
(QRSS) checklist for smaller survey teams supporting crisis action planning. Site survey data collected
with STEP is stored on the Employment Knowledge Base (EKB) as an ESP Part I enabling planners
worldwide access to the data for beddown planning, assessment, and familiarization. The Integrated
Expeditionary Site Survey Checklists (IESSC) may be used to collect site survey data when STEP is not
available or impractical to use. The checklists should reflect the same data entry points in STEP or a sim-
ilar capability to facilitate loading the data in STEP after the fact, and subsequent storage on the EKB. The
STEP QRSS checklist and IESSC are available from the Command logistics plans function.
5.2.2. In addition to known operating locations identified in contingency plans, site surveys should be
conducted at other possible beddown sites to better prepare air expeditionary forces for operations in
unfamiliar and austere locations. MAJCOMs and NAFs in a component role should identify locations
within their AOR as the most likely candidates for conducting contingency operations to include human-
itarian relief operations. Locations should be determined from theater engagement plans, Combatant
Commander’s staff inputs, intelligence information, etc. and prioritized for accomplishing actual site sur-
veys. The process of identifying possible beddown sites and surveying them is an ongoing effort. The list
of locations must be continuously reviewed and new locations surveyed as changing world conditions
drive new requirements.
5.3.Authorization. The MAJCOM logistics plans function or designated organization, provides oversight
for all site surveys in their AOR. Permission to conduct site surveys must be granted by this central MAJ-
COM authority prior to the actual visit. This process minimizes duplication of effort (multiple visits to the
same location), facilitates proper storage of critical information (ESP update and EKB upload), and
ensures surveys are accomplished in priority order. Units conducting site surveys outside of their AOR
should request permission through their own MAJCOM logistics plans function or designated organiza-
tion.

5.4. Site Survey Team. The mission dictates site survey team member selection. Every effort should be
made to include functional area subject matter experts (SME) of sufficient experience and rank from the
lead wing or major deploying units expected to operate at the location. Site survey team members using
STEP must be trained on the application. Figure 5.1. provides a suggested site survey team composition;
however, the mission and purpose of the site survey will determine the team size, composition, rank struc-
ture, specific experience required in each functional area, etc. When multiple MAJCOMs have opera-
tional responsibility at the same location they each may be granted permission to field a site survey team
(i.e., the same location has both AMC throughput mission and ACC aircraft beddown missions), but team
size should be limited to the maximum extent possible and cross utilization of personnel is encouraged.

5.5. ESSP Integrated Site Survey Team Composition. The ESSP is composed of two types of teams – a
dedicated initial site survey team and the follow-on team. The differences between the two teams are their
focus and products. Future site survey teams will have defined roles, an established team composition,
and a defined product thus eliminating any confusion on what is expected of the teams. The initial site sur-
vey team will be capable of producing the minimum essential data required on a site: the threat assess-
AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007                                                                            217


ment, the airfield suitability survey, the pavements evaluation, and the beddown assessment. The
follow-on team however, will be mission specific and will focus on the data that are pertinent to the suc-
cess of the given operation. These teams will be groups of highly trained individuals who have a working
knowledge of the process and the deliverables. Tools will be used that will expedite their efforts, and pri-
oritized actions will ensure time onsite is optimized. Site survey teams will provide planners and leaders
with decision-quality information.
5.5.1. Initial Site Survey Team (ISST). The cadre of personnel trained and capable of producing the fol-
lowing products. Although the ISST is limited to specific functional areas it by no way implies that other
functional areas do not facilitate the site survey process. Team limitations are a result of scope, time, and
country restrictions. If the scope of site survey exceeds the capability of the ISST, MAJCOMs and com-
ponent commands should make accommodations to the team composition but not to the detriment of pro-
ducing the aforementioned ISST products. These automated reports will be available in a future release of
LOGCAT.
5.5.1.1. Full Spectrum Threat Assessment – Security Forces, Preventative Medicine, Civil Engineering
Readiness and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI).
5.5.1.2. Airfield Suitability Survey – Airfield Operations (certified Airfield Manager plus 1).
5.5.1.3. Pavements Evaluation – Civil Engineering.
5.5.1.4. ECS Beddown Assessment – Civil Engineering, Contracting, Fuels, Munitions (SEI 375 quali-
fied), Communications, Combat Plans, Medical.
5.5.2. The Follow-on Team. The follow-on team should conduct detailed analysis of the information
available on the site/country and what additional information is required to successfully execute the antic-
ipated assigned mission. This team may consist of functional experts from the Open the Base Force Mod-
ule and typically either the component command, Contingency Response Unit (CRU), and air
expeditionary group/wing and associate units or a combination of all of the above. The focus of this team
is methodical data collection as it pertains to a specific mission and that site. To do this, the team will
determine the access and availability of host nation resources, capability of the site and host nation ability
to sustain operations, identify shortfalls/limiting factors (LIMFACS) and potential workarounds for each,
and develop a site beddown plan. The follow-on team is required to produce the final ESP.
5.5.3. Role of Team Chief (Responsibilities and Duties). The Team Chief is the senior Air Force person on
any site survey team and is responsible for the success of the survey and will certify any data collected by
his/her team. This person must be capable of interacting with high-ranking officials of other services and
nations. The team chief must have the capability and authority to make high-level decisions. This individ-
ual should understand Air Force operational capabilities as well as logistical implications of bedding
down various Air Force forces. The team chief should have an extensive working knowledge of the vari-
ous key functional areas and their minimum needs to beddown forces. The team chief is responsible for
several key functions within the site survey process. Duties of the team chief include, but are not limited
to those identified in Figure 5.2.

Terms
Aerial Port. An airfield that has been designated for the sustained air movement of personnel and mate-
riel as well as an authorized port for entrance into or departure from the country where located.
Agile Combat Support (ACS) – A core competency of the Air Force that includes the processes that cre-
ate, sustain and protect all air and space capabilities necessary to accomplish mission objectives across the
spectrum of conflict. It is the product of processes that ready the force, prepare the battle space, position
the force, employ, sustain, and recover the force.
Air Terminal. A facility on an airfield that functions as an air transportation hub and accommodates the
loading and unloading of airlift aircraft and intransit processing of traffic. The airfield may or may not be
designated an aerial port.
Combatant Commander – A commander of one of the unified or specified combatant commands estab-
lished by the President. Also called CDR. See also combatant command; specified combatant command;
unified combatant command. (Approved by JMTGM # 076-2864-94)

Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) – The tailored ACS capability deployed to expeditionary sites to
provide for air and space forces employed and engaged in operations. This capability is produced by rap-
idly deployable, tailored forces executing ACS processes to beddown, employ, maintain, protect and
redeploy tactical components of air and space power and production.
Employment Knowledge Base (EKB) – LOGCAT database that stores all STEP Agency (NIMA) air-
field data, and other information critical to contingency beddown planning.
Expeditionary Site Plans (ESP) – ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a permanent Air
Force presence and may contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial beddown decisions.
ESPs may be developed in short time frames to meet contingency needs without full staffing or coordina-
tion. It is the installation level or site plan to support unified and specified command wartime operations
plans, as well as MAJCOM supporting plans. It cuts across all functional support areas in a consolidated
view of installation missions, requirements, capabilities, and limitations to plan for actions and resources
supporting war or contingency operations, including deployment, post-deployment, and employment
activities (as appropriate).
Garrison GeoBase – Provides one installation map delivering current situational awareness in a secure
fashion via the base network.
GeoBase – An Air Force initiative to “attain, maintain, and sustain one geospatial infrastructure support-
ing all installation requirements.” GeoBase consists of a suite of three dimensions used for various func-
tions. They are as follows:
GeoReach and Expeditionary Basing – Provides a Common Installation Picture (CIP) using informa-
tion acquired from intelligence sources and assists with various planning aspects such as aircraft parking,
munitions storage, and other beddown force requirements.
In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP). Primarily developed for locations with a permanent Air
Force presence, and are fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many functional experts
with a deliberate planning time line. Replaces the former term Base Support Plan (BSP). All plans for-
merly called BSPs will be redesignated IGESPs. The term IGESP describes all plans developed to meet
deliberate planning requirements, contingency planning requirements, and any other site planning
requirements. While the term BSP is superseded; the requirement for robust, structured, and standardized
site planning based on AFI 10-404 remain.
In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC). A planning body appointed by the
installation commander to facilitate the development of the (normally comprised of senior level leader-
ship). The IGESPC serves as the focal point for plan development and reports to the commander on the
status of plans. It integrates the numerous base-level requirements and functional support actions to
present a coordinated overview of activity in the. This committee was formerly known as the Base Sup-
port Planning Committee (BSPC).
Level of Survey:
Suitability – Tests the ability of the site to meet basic requirements.
Feasibility – Tests the ability of the site to be adapted to use.
Capability – Tests the ability of the site to support a specified mission or deployment.
Sustainability – Tests the ability of the site to support a specified mission for an undetermined period of
time.

Limiting Factor. A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently, impedes mission accom-
plishment. (Joint Pub 1-02) {Has a critical negative impact on the ability of a unit to perform its wartime
mission, and require the aid of higher headquarters to resolve.}Used in this publication for clarity.
Logistician’s Contingency Assessment Tools (LOGCAT) – A NIPRNET/SIPRNET-based suite of stan-
dard systems tools that enables automated, employment-driven, agile combat support planning. LOGCAT
supports the and expeditionary site planning process by accurately and rapidly identifying resources and
combat support requirements at potential employment locations, providing beddown capability analysis
and LIMFAC identification, and facilitating force tailoring decisions to reduce the overall deployment
footprint. LOGCAT consists of three components that are mandated for use when they are available at all
levels of command.
MAJCOM Combat Plans Function – Provides command policy and guidance for implementing and
expeditionary site planning concepts to meet their specific missions.
Site Survey – The physical investigation of a location to gather data in support of a planned or possible
contingency operation. Site surveys are conducted for any or all of the following purposes: (1) To deter-
mine the feasibility of a location for planned operations; (2) To validate information about equipment, ter-
rain, host nation resources, and infrastructure such as serviceability, availability, compatibility, etc. (3) To
gather critical information for future operations and facilitate planning for the eventual use of a location.
Strategic GeoBase – Looks at broader geospatial imagery to understand the proximity of cities, geo-
graphical landmarks, and other areas of interest. This information is used in collaboration with the more
specific GeoBase garrison data to gain a more complete picture of the operating location.
Supported Command. The command having primary responsibility for an operation under an OPLAN
or contingency. (Definition used for this pub only)
Supporting Command. A command providing augmentation forces or other support to another (sup-
ported) command. (Definition used for this pub only)
Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP) – Partially automates the overall and expeditionary site
planning process and standardizes /ESP products via a sophisticated, multimedia tool for the collection of
base/site data. STEP is designed for in-garrison or deployed configurations, and incorporates functionally
based checklists to methodically capture data during site surveys. STEP organizes the data in a standard
format to facilitate beddown analysis and LIMFAC identification. STEP enables or ESP development
with separate Part I and Part II modules.

of required actions by indicating specific activities (e.g., identification, marshaling, evacuation) applica-
ble to the plan. Although the personnel community is responsible for preparing this portion of the IGESP/
ESP (which includes both establishment and implementation of procedures during actual operations),
numerous other agencies play important roles and their responsibilities cannot be overlooked. Thus, logis-
tics plans, services, security forces, OSI, comptroller, public affairs, transportation, CE Readiness NBC
personnel, etc., are OCRs in the development of NEO planning and should provide the personnel office
with operational procedures pertaining to their specific functions (e.g., Services will plan lodging require-
ments, and Transportation will identify airlift/sealift evacuation procedures, etc.).

LODGING
PART I:
15.1. Identify the total lodging capacity using the definitions and criteria listed below. Total lodging
capacity will be computed according to the priorities established in paragraph B15.1.9 and using the
emergency capacity planning factor of 50 sq. ft per person. Bases may go below 50 sq. ft per person only
when the TPFDD population exceeds the rate at which housekeeping assets are erected. For safety rea-
sons, reduction in square footage per person must not obstruct entrances or exits. Determination of total
lodging capacity is based on the scenario. For example, in most exercise receptions, only visiting officer/
enlisted quarters, contract quarters, and available dorms will be considered. However, during a contin-
gency or OPLAN situation, emergency quarters (e.g., base fitness center, recreation center, etc.) will be
used. Additionally, during a contingency or OPLAN execution, vacated base housing and dorms (due to
deploying forces and noncombatant evacuations) will be considered. In computing total emergency lodg-
ing capacity consider the type of facilities available (e.g., room-bath-room configuration vs. central
latrine). A dormitory bedroom with the room-bath-room configuration may be large enough to accommo-
date four bed spaces, however eight people using one bathroom is unacceptable. Also, a percentage of the
total lodging capacity will need to be set aside for storage of personal property left behind by departed
(deployed) personnel and noncombatants (applies to dormitories and family housing). Note: Although
some lodging categories will not have to be utilized in Part II of the IGESP, all priorities (except Contin-
gency Housekeeping Assets) should be included in the computation of capacities in Part I.
15.1.7. Family Housing. As a last resort, family housing units may be used to house transient people. In
overseas areas where a NEO program is to be implemented in wartime to evacuate dependents and US cit-
izens, using family housing is a viable way to provide housing for NEO evacuees. Such a plan will house
incoming NEO families and unaccompanied personnel in family quarters vacated by families already
evacuated. Families not yet evacuated may be asked to house NEO personnel in their quarters on a volun-
tary or even mandatory basis in wartime. Family housing should be used for transient unaccompanied per-
sonnel only when no other practical alternative exists. The wing commander will determine whether
family housing will be used for lodging. In instances where an NBCC threat exists and family housing is
used for NEO operations, Services personnel will distribute brochures (developed by CE Readiness)

describing how to transform the living quarters into a protective shelter. Refer to the NEO chapter of the
IGESP/ESP for additional information.
15.1.9. Lodging Priorities. The priority for lodging personnel is as follows:
      Priority 1: Emergency capacity for all transient quarters
      Priority 2: Commercial lodging/contract quarters
      Priority 3: Emergency capacity in dormitories
      Priority 4: Alternate permanent facilities
      Priority 5: Family housing
      Priority 6: Contingency Housekeeping Assets (Note: List all WRM assets, including beds, cots, tents,
      Harvest Housekeeping Sets, and any other contingency housekeeping assets, in Part II (classified) of
      the IGESP (paragraph B15.5.5.3.). However, include the following statement in Part I: “See Part II of
      the IGESP for in-place/due-in WRM assets”).
15.2. The following outlines how lodging capacities should be calculated and what information should be
documented.
15.5.3. ________personnel from (specify unit) will provide augmentation support (determine require-
ments IAW the READY program and the Personnel chapter of the IGESP).
15.5.5.3. The following outlines how and where the base population will be assigned lodging and what
documentation is required. Assignments will be based on capacities and priorities in Part I. Rooms will
contain only essential furnishings. Try to specify designated unit/occupant and the date the building will
be required (by C-day per the TPFDD). Assign incoming personnel to rooms vacated by permanent party
personnel deployed to other locations or evacuated under NEO, as required. Develop a plan for securing
personal property left behind by all departing personnel and dependents to include designated storage
facility and managing unit. Relocation of permanent party personnel and their personal possessions to
accommodate and consolidate incoming personnel should be avoided.
15.9. Vehicles. (Coordinate with the Transportation chapter of the IGESP) Unit Services personnel will
plan vehicle requirements. Coordinate with unit VCO and the Vehicle Operations Fleet Management Sec-
tion to ensure completeness prior to the Transportation Function consolidation of unit requirements for
publication of the IGESP. The Transportation Function prior to their inclusion in the IGESP must approve
all subsequent changes to vehicle authorizations, including WRM vehicles.

CHAPTER 20 - TRANSPORTATION
20.1. This section provides an overview of transportation capabilities for base forces and units participat-
ing in activities involving the base (deployment from, deployment to, or transit) during peacetime exer-
cises and day-to-day operations. The Base Support Plan (IGESP) Part I is, in effect, a unit capabilities
plan. The following format should be followed in developing Part I.
232                                                              AFI10-404_AFSPC_I 1 MARCH 2007


20.4. Functional Assumptions. List all factors taken into consideration to determine base support capabil-
ities. For example, normal duty hours, reliance on commercial contractors for specific functions, etc. An
important point to remember is that each assumption will have a major impact on the ability to meet
IGESP responsibilities should the assumption prove to be incorrect.
20.11.1. Transportation Combat Readiness and Resources Flight. This office serves as the focal point for
consolidating OPLAN planning and all planning issues affecting the utilization of any and all transporta-
tion resources. It monitors readiness posture of transportation flights. In concert with other transportation
flight chiefs, it performs capability analysis to ensure sufficient resources to meet ExPlan/OPLAN and
resulting IGESP taskings. It also ensures transportation inputs that impact upon airlift requests are fully
coordinated and takes action to resolve transportation deficiencies. During deployment operations, this
flight becomes the TCC support staff as situations and personal expertise permit, and as directed by the
Transportation Function.
20.11.2. Transportation Control Center (TCC). The nerve center of transportation units during deploy-
ment/contingency operations. The TCC is the transportation "command post" and will be capable of being
manned and equipped 24 hours a day. This work center is the command and control for all transportation
resources for the duration of the contingency, and consequently, is the only emergency work center that
does not phase out prior to cessation of the contingency. All transportation work centers will keep the
TCC advised of their status and of all problems and assistance required. The TCC will be the initial source
of contact for all support requests not covered in the IGESP and for IGESP support which is not being
met. Outline your TCC concept of operations and provide essential details of operation.
20.11.4. Vehicle Operations Flight. Vehicle Operations is the wing’s single manager for Air Force regis-
tered vehicles, and the sole source of organic movement capability where no unit functional vehicle capa-
bility exists. Units possessing vehicle authorizations are expected to perform movements with in-house
capability. Excess vehicle operations capability beyond that tasked in the IGESP may be requested from
TMO, who will levy lift requirements to both vehicle operations and other available carriers commensu-
rate with established criteria. It is therefore important that vehicle operations identify recurring on-base
support services such as base taxi or shuttle bus operations, or state that such services are not available.
20.11.4.2. Vehicle operations take action IAW appropriate directives to secure approval for WRM vehicle
release and responds to command directives for vehicle shipments to any area. It advises TCC of vehicle
losses for subsequent command action, and keeps the TCC/TMO apprised of organic movement capabil-
ity and mission impact as a result of insufficient vehicle assets. The chief of transportation, through the
Vehicle Operations Flight, will advise contracting of vehicle requirements and quantities. As the wing sin-
gle manager for registered vehicles, only those assets reflected in the transportation chapter are consid-
ered true vehicle requirements. Vehicle requirements will not be reflected in any other IGESP chapter. If
a reference to vehicle is deemed essential, a statement to refer to the transportation chapter will suffice.
20.12. LIMFACS. After comparing base capabilities against OPLAN requirements, identify any limiting
factors and submit to the logistics plans function for review by the IGESPC. If approved, IGESP LIM-
FACs will be documented in the LIMFACs chapter of the IGESP and forwarded to MAJCOM HQ and the
NAF.

This chapter (in an IGESP Part I) should be developed by local air transportation agencies in consultation
with HQ AMC/A4X. This chapter (in an IGESP Part II) must be developed with the assistance of HQ
AMC/A4X. Depending on temporary assigned duty/temporary duty (TAD/TDY) budgets that may limit
HQ AMC participation at planning conferences, any revision proposed for this chapter by any level of
theater planning staff (e.g. unified, air component command/combat numbered air force (NAF), or wing/
unit) should be sent to HQ AMC/A4X for review and concurrence prior to publication and dissemination.
21.5. This Chapter will be written/authored by HQ AMC/A4X with technical assistance regarding infra-
structure, operations in NBC environments, and funding issues being provided from HQ AMC/XP and
CE and any unique force protection issues being coordinated on by HQ AMC/SFX. The Part II chapter
will be broken into four distinct or “main” parts.
21.5.3. Each CONUS plans office will evaluate the worst case OPLAN "All Forces" TPFDD and deter-
mine throughput and reception. If over any 30-day period the base throughput exceeds 3000 short tons of
cargo or 10,000 PAX, or receives/beddowns over 300 personnel or is considered a primary NEO Repatri-
ation Airfield, the base must write Chapter 21, Part II. If a base meets this criteria, local base logistics and
transportation planners will complete a Chapter 21, Part II and submit it to HQ AMC/A4X for final vali-
dation. If a base does not meet these criteria, only Chapter 21 Part I is required.
21.9. At a minimum, address parking capabilities for C-5, C-9, (C-12, C-20, C-21, or other operational
support aircraft (OSA) as necessary), C-17, C-27, C-130, C-141, KC-135/KC-10 (as warranted), and
CRAF aircraft. These parking capabilities should be reflected for each type of aircraft assuming no other
cargo or support aircraft are on the ground at the same time (i.e., "the base is capable of supporting
______C-130s, if no other cargo or support aircraft are on the ground at the same time"). NOTE: The host
or lead wing should address parking capabilities for theater assets (i.e., C-12, C-130). Combination air-
craft parking MOG must also be calculated based on the most likely transient or beddown aircraft types
identified in the USAF WMP-4/WAAR, or an interpretation of modeling products from the AMC Deploy-
ment Analysis System (ADANS) and Combined Mating and Ranging Planning System (CMARPS) pro-
vided by HQ AMC IGESP team members at Part II planning conferences. Remember to take into account
bomber/fighter parking requirements as addressed in Chapter 8, “Airfield Loading/ Parking Plan.”

CHAPTER 22 - WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM)
22.1. WRM planning identified in the IGESP is not a restatement of AFI 25-101 responsibilities and
requirements. Rather, it identifies local requirements and procedures necessary to ensure in-place and
incoming WRM can support the operations.
22.2. During IGESP site surveys, using units will identify Base Operating Support (BOS) requirements
(i.e., vehicles) to the host base and include it in the IGESP Part II. The host base will forward BOS

CHAPTER 23 - SUPPORT AGREEMENTS/HOST NATION SUPPORT
23.2. Support provided by other major commands, services, or nations, does not require duplication
within the IGESP if the agreement was negotiated to remain in effect during contingencies. Agreements
identified to remain in effect during contingency/wartime will contain a statement in the remarks section
of the agreement allowing for this support. Care must be taken to identify basic logistical support that may
be covered via support agreement but not arranged for during OPLAN execution. This information should
be included in the IGESP. Examples of basic logistical support provided under support agreements
includes power, communications, water, messing, facilities, transportation, maintenance, and personnel
services. Care must taken to identify the Local National employee status as described in Host National
Support agreements during contingency/wartime operations and insure any restrictions or conditions are
incorporated in the planning process.

CHAPTER 24 - MAINTENANCE
24.1. Outline the general maintenance plan to support aircraft operations. Maintenance of aircraft and
associated support equipment will be performed IAW Air Force and applicable MAJCOM aircraft main-
tenance instructions; use this area to discuss any peculiarities of organization or operations that affect the
base. For example, 15 ABW might note that no LSS is assigned to the base, so engine management issues
are worked directly with the 15th Logistics Support Division. Additionally, units receiving day-to-day
and/or contingency support from collocated or nearby units, facilities, and airfields (military or commer-
cial) for aircraft operations should identify this in the IGESP, Part I. This applies to Air Force Reserve
Component (AFRC) / Air National Guard (ANG) units receiving support from an active unit or active
units receiving reciprocal support from the AFRC/ANG.
24.2.4. Transportation. Note transportation requirements, sources, distribution, and maintenance/control
procedures not covered elsewhere. Compute additional vehicle requirements considering on-hand vehicle
fleet, as well as any WRM vehicles assigned to your unit. Provide requirements to the Transportation
Function by vehicle type, number currently authorized for peacetime operation, number currently
assigned, and number required to support OPLAN requirements. Coordinate with the Transportation
Function to ensure completeness before they consolidate wing requirements in the Transportation Chapter
of the IGESP. All subsequent changes of vehicle authorizations, including WRM vehicles, must have the
Transportation Function approval prior to inclusion in the IGESP. Munitions vehicle requirements are
included in the Transportation chapter of the IGESP. Identify procedures for repair of high use equipment
such as forklifts and tow vehicles.
24.5.4. Outline the forms and actions necessary to develop the flying and maintenance schedules. This
schedule includes the time-phased aircraft generation and scheduled maintenance requirements for the
fleet. It assists in planning emergency maintenance workloads and permits supporting functions to deter-
mine required workload schedules. Ensure the employing unit prepares the generation schedule for
incoming aircraft based on latest arrival time and ensure they forward them to the reception base for inclu-
sion in the IGESP. Ensure that each required generation or maintenance action for at least the first 72

CHAPTER 25 - MUNITIONS
PART I:
25.1. In coordination with the Logistics Group Commander, munitions units will develop munitions
employment plans (MEP) using the following guidance. The plan must be in direct support of taskings
outlined in applicable OPLANS, CONPLANS, and the IGESP.
25.4. Chapter development starts with performing a thorough and comprehensive initial site survey. For
someone else to address munitions matters instead of a munitions expert requires that person to be knowl-
edgeable in areas that take years of experience to acquire. Surveys are not just a one-time effort either.
Annual visits to the beddown location are a necessity, especially if newly assigned personnel are involved.
Insist that a knowledgeable munitions NCO/Officer accompany the survey team, it will benefit all con-
cerned. It is essential for the munitions IGESP OPR to coordinate with applicable base agencies to ensure
required support will take place, and that this support requirement is cross referenced in their respective
portions of the IGESP/ESP. If a site survey is not possible due to the sensitivity of location, the Contin-
gency Reference Book and Ground Logistics Study contain valuable data for writing the MEP. These doc-
uments are available at wing intelligence (IN) offices, worldwide.
25.8.22. Transportation. Note transportation requirements, sources, distribution, and maintenance and
control procedures not covered elsewhere. Compute additional vehicle requirements considering on-hand
vehicle fleet, as well as any WRM vehicles assigned to your unit. Provide requirements to the Transporta-
tion Function by vehicle type, number currently authorized for peacetime operation, number currently
assigned, and number required to support OPLAN requirements. Coordinate with the Transportation
Function to ensure completeness before the Transportation Function consolidation of wing requirements
in the Transportation Chapter of the IGESP. All subsequent changes of vehicle authorizations, including
WRM vehicles, must have the Transportation Function approval prior to inclusion in the IGESP. Muni-
tions vehicle requirements are included in the Transportation chapter of the IGESP. Identify procedures
for repair of high use equipment such as forklifts and tow vehicles.
25.8.29. LIMFACs/Shortfalls. Consolidate all shortfalls and limiting factors in this section and outline
efforts to resolve them. Number and assign each LIMFAC an office of primary responsibility (OPR),
point of contact (POC), estimated completion date (ECD), impact assessment and work around. After
identifying LIMFACs or shortfalls submit them to logistics plans for review by the IGESPC.
