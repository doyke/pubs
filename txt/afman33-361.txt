        (i.e. AFMAN33-361, AF Form 673). (T-3). Note: It is the OPR/POC’s responsibility to
        identify and place figures, tables, and graphics in the integrated file where they are to be
        printed.
        9.4.2. The OPR/POC must also provide separate source graphics files in “.tif”, “jpg”,

            formats such as .pdf files and metadata for unique products (i.e., visual aids).
        9.4.3. Policy Memorandums (PMs), Guidance Memorandums (GMs) and Supplements
        to DOD issuances are required to be in camera ready Word format so AFDPO can apply
        the published date as they post. (T-2).
10. Submitting Classified Products for Review. OPR/POCs with classified products that
require a format review must submit an email to the AFDPO/PPP workflow usaf.pentagon.saf-
aa.mbx.afdpo-ppp@mail.mil. The email must include the product information such as product
number, title, classification, OPR, POC name, email address and DSN. Note: Do not submit
classified information via an unclassified network. AFDPO will review the product and provide
feedback to the OPR as necessary. (T-2).
11. Periodic Reviews. Periodic product review actions are auto-generated via AFIMPT.
Reviews are also initiated by the pubs/forms manager via AFIMPT. Additional detailed
instructions on processing reviews are located in the AFIMPT “Help” menu.
https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/afimpt.
12. Departmental Form Development. When a requirement exists to collect information,
OPRs will develop draft forms and provide to AFDPO. The OPR must ensure the new form does
not duplicate an existing Air Force or DoD form. Forms must be prescribed in directive type
publications. (T-2). All departmental forms will be designed by AFDPO using the mandated
Air Force forms designer software. Note: If a new or revised publication prescribes a form,
allow time to design, reproduce (physical), and disseminate (physical) the new or revised form.
OPRs must coordinate the proposed form with functional offices (see AFI 33-360). (T-2). Once
the final version of the form is approved by the OPR, AFDPO will post to the e-Publishing
website. (T-2).     When posting a new publication which prescribes new forms, both the
AFMAN33-361 21 MARCH 2014                                                                      9


publication and form(s) must be posted simultaneously. (T-2).    AFDPO issues and maintains a
control log for each departmental form number assignment.
13. Field Form Development.
   13.1. With the exception of ANG Wings, field activities must design the form, complete the
   metadata, and lock their forms before submitting to AFDPO. (T-3). Forms must be
   submitted via AFIMPT for posting on the e-Publishing website. (T-2).
   13.2. The unlocked file must follow the file naming convention (e.g.,
   ACC201_unlocked.xfdl). Detailed instructions are also provided in the AFIMPT training
   guide located in HELP menu of the application.
   13.3. Prior to submitting forms for posting to the e-Publishing website, the following must
   be accomplished:
   13.4. Save the form as an unlocked form.
       13.4.1. To save as unlocked:
           13.4.1.1. Go to File – Save As.
           13.4.1.2. When the Dialog box comes up, go to File name and add _unlocked to the
           File name then hit save. (e.g., AF3_unlocked.xfdl).
           13.4.1.3. When the dialogue box comes up, select Finish. If you have saved before,
           check overwrite existing file and then select finish.
       13.4.2. Field Activities must upload the unlocked form to AFIMPT and forward to
       AFDPO for final processing and posting to the website. (T-2). Note: AFDPO does not
       process forms below wing level.
14. Submitting Items for the Product Announcement. Product announcements (PA) inform
users of new, revised, or obsolete electronic and physical products. Product announcements are
issued bi-weekly and can be accessed under the Product Announcement link on the e-Publishing
website. Publications/forms managers are responsible for forwarding information about their
products to AFDPO to be included in the product announcement. Note: Products published via
AFIMPT are automatically included in the PA. Therefore, it is not necessary to forward a
separate email. Customers with products that are not automatically published via AFIMPT but
must be included in the PA should forward an email to the workflow usaf.pentagon.saf-
aa.mbx.afdpo-ppp@mail.mil. The email must include product type and number (short title),
long title product title, and date of product. (T-2). Information received after the cut-off of a
product announcement will appear in the next product announcement published. Product
announcement information should be submitted via e-mail to usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.afdpo-
ppp@mail.mil.

Section C—Procurement and Distribution Process

15. General Information. With the exception of ANG Wings, the procurement and distribution
process includes printing procurement, receipt, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of physical
publishing products.
 10                                                           AFMAN33-361 21 MARCH 2014


16. Requesting Printing Support. With the exception of ANG Wings, requests for printing
support must be coordinated with AFDPO/PPP usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.afdpo-
ppp@mail.mil for funding approval prior to submitting the publishing product for final
processing. (T-2). See AFI 33-360, paragraph 9.2., for further guidance. OPRs must identify
their printing requirement and provide a justification for printing on the AF Form 673. (T-2).
When a publishing product requires printing, the OPR must submit a GPO Form 952 (GPO 952),
Desktop Publishing Disk Information; a compact disc (CD) which contains any necessary
artwork; and a separate document which contains the printing specifications. (T-2). OPRs
should contact their local graphics office for assistance with completing the GPO 952 and the
CD.
17. Physical Product Storage and Distribution from the Army MDD. With the exception of
ANG Wings, field publications/forms managers who require AFDPO support for storage and
distribution of their physical products must send a request to AFDPO usaf.pentagon.saf-
aa.mbx.afdpo-ppp@mail.mil prior to sending the product to the Army MDD. At a minimum,
your request should contain the OPR, contact number, office symbol, product type and number,
product title, date, requested delivery date and quantity to be stored. Upon approval of your
request, AFDPO will provide the requester with a product ID and specific labeling requirements.
(T-3).     AFDPO will also send a monthly inventory to the applicable MAJCOM
publications/forms manager for MAJCOM products stocked in the Army MDD.
Publications/forms managers shall thoroughly review this inventory listing for stock needing
replenishment as well as to ensure the currency of products in stock. If a publications/forms
manager determines that stock of their product needs to be replenished, they shall take the
necessary measures to reorder stock and forward to the Army MDD. Prior to sending new or
reprinted products to the Army MDD, publication and forms managers must forward a copy of
their printing documentation or a memo specifying the product type and number, product title,
product date, OPR, due-in date, due-in quantity, unit of issue, unit of issue quantity (if
applicable) and printing specifications to AFDPO usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.afdpo-
ppp@mail.mil. (T-3). If the product is a revision, the publications and forms manager is
responsible for providing disposition instructions for the existing stock (i.e., previous edition is
obsolete, to be salvaged, is to be used until exhausted, etc.). Note: Only publications/forms
managers are authorized to request to forward stock directly to the Army MDD. (T-3).
18. Distribution of Restricted/Controlled Products. For Official Use Only (FOUO) and other
restricted products can only be obtained in electronic format via the Warehouse Management
System (WMS) which is .mil/common access card (CAC) restricted. Only unclassified metadata
for restricted products can be posted to the e-Publishing website.
19. Obtaining Restricted/Controlled Products. Organizational accounts are required for
organizations requiring controlled products (FOUO publications and storage safeguard or
accountable forms). (T-2). Note: Establishing an organizational account should not be
confused with placing an order. Once your organizational account is approved, you must
access WMS online ordering to place your order. Establishing the account and placing an
order are two different actions.
20. Obtaining an Organizational Account.
   20.1. Use an AF Form 1846, Request For and Record of Organizational Account, to
   establish an organizational account. (T-2). Prepare the AF Form 1846 and retain a copy for
AFMAN33-361 21 MARCH 2014                                                                      11


   your records. (T-2). You must have a “.mil”, “.gov”, or “.edu” email extension to be
   approved for an organizational user account. The OAR should complete and then send the
   approved AF Form 1846 to the organization's publishing office for signature of the
   publications and forms manager and then forward to AFDPO . Submit the completed AF
   Form 1846 to AFDPO via e-mail, or fax to DSN 754-2387; Commercial: 202-404-2387. (T-
   2). Once AFDPO has processed the request, the account information will be sent to the OAR
   at the organizational e-mail address provided on the AF Form 1846. Note: Organizational
   accounts will be approved and issued for restricted/controlled (FOUO, accountable, storage
   safeguard and General Officer Protocol Stationery products only). (T-2).
       20.1.1. Complete the AF Form 1846 as follows:
           20.1.1.1. OAR Information. Identification boxes are used to identify your location.
           They are self-explanatory. The requesting official is the OAR.
           20.1.1.2. Publications and Forms Manager Signature. Their signature verifies that
           the organization exists on the base. The publications/forms manager official must
           return the form to the OAR who then sends the completed AF Form 1846 to AFDPO
           via fax mail or via email. (T-2). For contractors requiring controlled products, the
           organization commander or the contracting officer will sign and approve the AF Form
           1846. This signature is the authorization for the organization to receive controlled
           products.
           20.1.1.3. Account Number. Leave blank. WMS will generate a system notification
           with the account number to the OAR after the account request is approved and
           processed.
           20.1.1.4. Account Validation. Upon receipt of the account information, the OAR
           must access the WMS website to validate (register) the account. (T-3).
21. How to Request Changes to an Organizational Account. All changes to an
organizational account require the submission of a revised AF Form 1846. (T-2). The OAR
marks the revision block on the top of the form to indicate that the form is revised. The OAR
also fills in the account number block when submitting any changes. When the OAR changes, a
revised AF Form 1846 must be submitted to AFDPO. If the OAR is the only change, only
information required on the revised form is the new OAR’s information and signature and the
approving official’s name and signature. (T-2). When OARs need to add or delete an item from
the organizational account or cancel the account, they must submit a revised AF Form 1846. The
changes they request must be clearly identified on the form. Additions and deletions require the
OAR and approving official’s names and signatures. (T-2).
22. Issuing Organizational Accounts to Contractors. Contractors’ requests must be approved
by the contracting officer and include the contract number and expiration date of contract. (T-3).
Additionally, you must have a “.mil” e-mail extension on the e-mail address to establish an
organizational account. A contractor should not establish or request an organizational account
for one-time issues or for unrestricted/unclassified physical products. Contractors who have a
“.mil” e-mail address can establish general user accounts for unrestricted/ unclassified physical
products. Contractors who have a need for a one-time issue of physical products should obtain
the needed items through their contracting officers. The contracting officer should submit orders
for one-time issuances of physical products via WMS online ordering.
 12                                                           AFMAN33-361 21 MARCH 2014


23. Air Force Contracting Officers. Contracting Officers are responsible for approving the AF
Form 1846, which authorizes contractors to order restricted/controlled physical products. (T-2).
Ensure the AF Form 1846 includes the contract number, expiration date, and the list of physical
products the contractor is authorized to use. (T-2).
24. Obtaining Unclassified/Unrestricted Physical Products.
   24.1. Individuals needing unrestricted physical products should request a user account via
   the    WMS      website.       You     must     have    a   CAC     to    access   WMS.
   https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/wms/.
       24.1.1. Requests for user accounts are submitted and processed on-line using the link
       https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/wms/.
       24.1.2. Users should access WMS and click on the “Accounts” tab.
       24.1.3. Click on the “My Personal Information” link on the left side of the screen.
       24.1.4. Add the information and click “SAVE”.
   24.2. AFDPO will issue Air Force products to sister services and other government agencies
   only. Non-government agencies must go through their respective channels to obtain DoD,
   GSA (Standard Forms), and other non-Air Force products. Once an order is submitted, users
   will receive three acknowledgements; 1) when the order is placed, 2) once it is processed
   and, the last, 3) when it ships. Customers can view the status of orders on-line (see
   Attachment 2 for additional guidance). AFDPO imposes a monthly maximum issue on each
   physical product stocked at the Army MDD. The maximum issue is based on the average
   monthly usage of each product. If you need a one-time issue which exceeds the maximum
   issue, you will be able to submit your order for the quantity you need via on-line ordering.
   You must then fax or e-mail a justification with your commander’s/director’s signature to
   AFDPO within one week of placing your order. (T-3).                 If you do not submit your
   justification your order will be cancelled or the quantity will be changed. You will be notified
   via e-mail of the status of your order. If you need more than the maximum issue on a
   recurring basis (non-controlled/unrestricted products only), send a request through your
   MAJCOM publications/forms manager or the OPR for the product, as appropriate. Once
   AFDPO receives the approved request from either your MAJCOM publications/forms
   manager or the OPR for the product, AFDPO will waive the over maximum issue limit for
   your account for that particular product. You will be allowed to order the amount you were
   approved for on a monthly basis without being required to complete the review process;
   however, additional amounts exceeding the recurring approval amount will require a
   justification letter. Please remember to include in your request your account number, the
   product number of the product you are ordering, and the quantity you will need to order each
   month.
25. Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS). The e-Publishing website
provides a link to DAPS for ordering bulk printing of electronic products. Alternatively,
customers may order directly from their local DAPS office. Note: Funding for printing of
publishing products may be centralized within your local publishing function. Contact your
publications/forms manager for local procedures.

social function when a general officer acts as host on behalf of the Air Force at an Air Force-
sponsored function; or when a general officer participates in an official social function as an
official representative of the Air Force. General Officer note paper may also be used for
correspondence that is duty related, but of a more personal or private nature.
28. How to Obtain Social Protocol Stationery. Protocol officers and executives may order
stationery items via the WMS online ordering website. The OAR may order or they may
establish a separate organizational account representative to order protocol stationery (see

orders. As soon as the OAR receives a shipment of accountable forms from the Army MDD,
they should thoroughly check each form for proper serial number and compare the shipment with
entries on the document receipt, which accompanies the shipment. If the inventory is correct,
sign the original receipt and forward it to AFDPO within 30 days. If there is any discrepancy,
immediately report this to AFDPO, by annotating the receipt with the serial numbers and the
quantity received; sign the bottom and return it. If there is a loss of accountable forms for which
the OAR is accountable, promptly start investigative procedures and report the circumstances
through command channels to the OPR. The OPR is listed in the prescribing directive; also, read
the directive to see if it gives any special instructions on how to report the loss.
If the signed document receipt is not forwarded to AFDPO within 30 days, your organizational

account will be disabled and you will be unable to submit orders until you submit the receipt and

it is received.
