        certifications and training requirements. Reference AFI 11-202 Volume 2, Aircrew
        Standardization/Evaluation Program, for guidance on crewmember responsibilities
        relating to transporting qualification records [i.e. Flight Evaluation Folders (FEF)].
        1.2.6.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
        guidelines of this instruction.
        1.2.6.3. Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are
        adequately prepared, trained, qualified and current.
1.3. Processing Changes.
     1.3.1. Process changes using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
     IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, and AFI 11-215, USAF Flight
     Manuals Program (FMP), through local and MAJCOM training channels to ACC/A3TO
     who will then forward coordinated recommended changes to AF/A3O-AI for approval.
     1.3.2. ACC/A3 will:
        1.3.2.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic instruction with all MAJCOM A3s.
        1.3.2.2. Process recommendation for change.
        1.3.2.3. Forward recommendations for changes to this volume to AF/A3O-AI for
        AF/A3/5 approval.
        1.3.2.4. Address time sensitive changes by an immediate action message.
     1.3.3. MAJCOM A3s will determine training requirements for their subordinate units and
     coordinated these training requirements through ACC/A3 for AF/A3/5 approval. As
     necessary, AFDPO will issue publication changes via revision, Interim Change, or
     Administrative Change, IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
1.4. Training. Aircrew training programs are designed to progress aircrew from Initial
Qualification Training (IQC/TX-1), Re-Qualification Training (TX-2), or Training as directed by
the squadron commander (TX-3) to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to
Continuation Training (CT).
     1.4.1. IQT. TX-1, TX-2, TX-3, or Senior Staff Qualification Course (SSQC) provide the
     training necessary to initially qualify aircrew in a basic position and flying duties without
     regard to the unit’s mission. See Chapter 2. Upon completion of TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 or
     SSQC, the crewmember attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a
     prerequisite for MQT. Except for General Officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-
     term qualification status. Waiver authority for any crewmember, other than General Officers
     above the wing level and API-6/-8 aircrew in designated Test Squadrons located at a base
     without B-1 aircraft, to remain BAQ for longer than 6 months is MAJCOM/A3. NOTE: If
     a crewmember’s MQT lasts longer than six months the crewmember may fly only MQT
     sorties without obtaining a waiver.
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 9


  1.4.2. MQT. MQT provides crewmembers the advanced training necessary to certify a
  crewmember in flight duties that directly support a unit’s mission. See Chapter 3.
  Crewmembers maintain BAQ status until completion of MQT and subsequent CMR or BMC
  designation. The Formal Training Unit (FTU) Instructor course is equivalent to a unit MQT
  program.
  1.4.3. CT. CT consists of aircrew training in the basic flying skills necessary to ensure safe
  operation of the aircraft and specific mission-related training required to accomplish the
  unit’s assigned missions.
  1.4.4. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). RAP is the CT program designed to focus training
  on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. Specific RAP instructions
  are issued by each MAJCOM via a RTM (see Chapter 4). Upon completion of IQT and
  MQT, aircrew will be trained in all the basic missions of a specific unit, unless excepted in
  Chapter 3. Crewmembers who have completed MQT will be assigned to either a Combat
  Mission Ready (CMR) position or a Basic Mission Capable (BMC) position.
     1.4.4.1. CMR. A status that denotes a crewmember is receiving the minimum training
     required to be certified, current, and proficient in all of the primary DOC mission
     requirements of their assigned or attached unit.
         1.4.4.1.1. All combat unit (CC-coded) active duty API-1 and API-2 positions, flying
         squadron commander (SQ/CC), and squadron director of operations (SQ/DO)
         positions are designated CMR positions. Flight examiners will maintain CMR status.
         EXCEPTION: FTU, HHQ, senior flight examiners, and HHQ-designated
         test/evaluation unit examiners will maintain BMC status. OG/CCs may designate
         other API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. [EXCEPTION; If
         a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit
         Manning Document (UMD) API-1s and API-2s to CMR and designate the overage
         BMC. In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced aircrew, with at least
         50%, if available, designated CMR.]
         1.4.4.1.2. CMR aircrew will maintain proficiency and qualification in all core
         missions of the flying unit to which the crewmember is assigned or attached. CMR
         aircrew maintain currencies which affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated
         flight training (missions and events), and all mission ground training. Failure to
         complete this training or maintain these currencies could result in regression to Non-
         CMR (N-CMR) status, unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR, a
         crewmember may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) and
         events in which the crewmember is current at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
     1.4.4.2. BMC. A status that denotes a crewmember is receiving the minimum training
     required to be familiar with all, and may be certified and proficient in some, of the
     primary DOC mission requirement of their assigned or attached unit.
         1.4.4.2.1. All active duty wing aircrew positions that are not designated CMR
         positions per paragraph 1.4.4.1.1 are designated BMC positions. BMC designation
         is assigned to aircrew that have a primary job performing wing supervision or staff
         functions that directly support the flight operation, FTU instructors, WIC instructors,
         operational test aircrew, and subject matter experts assigned to 29 Training Systems
 10                                                      AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


          Squadron (TSS)/ Detachment (DET) 4 and ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS)
          DET 14. However, these aircrews are required to provide additional sortie generation
          capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying
          squadrons.
          1.4.4.2.2. BMC crewmembers must be able to attain proficiency and, if required,
          certification/qualification in 30 days or less for those missions/events they maintain
          familiarization only.
          1.4.4.2.3. BMC crewmembers will accomplish all mission related ground training
          designated by their attached SQ/CC.
          1.4.4.2.4. BMC crewmembers may deploy and participate in any mission for which
          they are proficient and qualified, without additional training, as determined by the
          SQ/CC.
          1.4.4.2.5. As described in the B-1 RTM, failure to complete required BMC training
          results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC will
          determine missions the aircrew may perform and the supervision required.
      1.4.4.3. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skill
      necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions that are not required by every
      crewmember. Specialized training consists of upgrade training such as flight lead,
      mission commander, etc., as well as CT to maintain proficiency and qualification in unit
      tasked special capabilities and missions.
          1.4.4.3.1. Specialized training is normally accomplished after an crewmember is
          assigned CMR/BMC status; and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements.
          Unless otherwise specified, aircrew in BMC or CMR positions may hold special
          capabilities/qualifications as long as any additional training requirements are
          accomplished.
          1.4.4.3.2. SQ/CCs will determine and assign aircrew that will train for and maintain
          special mission certifications.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This instruction provides
   training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
   flying and operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate formal operation
   training syllabi for ACC/A3 approval. Designated Test Units (CB-coded) may develop
   syllabi to upgrade Operation Test Aircrew in support of specific test plans. Mission
   qualification training and continuation training programs will be developed and approved by
   the OG/CC.
   1.5.3. Units will design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked
   roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   11


   capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g.,
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery
   procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intel briefing/debriefing).
   Tactical training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators,
   countermeasures, and dissimilar aircraft as much as practical.
   1.5.4. In Flight Supervision.
       1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision
       necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
       introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor
       may be required.
       1.5.4.2. Instructor Pilots (IP), Instructor WSOs (IWSO), Flight Leads (FL), and Multi-
       ship Mission Leads (MML) certified SQ supervisors may allow any crewmember to lead
       limited portions of a mission if they are appropriately briefed. This provision will only be
       used to allow the crewmember to practice events in which the crewmember is already
       certified or to help determine if the pilot is ready for Flight Lead Upgrade (FLUG) or
       MML Upgrade. In either case, the IP, IWSO, or SQ supervisor is responsible for the
       flight.
       1.5.4.3. Flight/Mission leads may give their wingman the tactical lead for specific tasks.
       As the tactical lead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the flight, but the
       flight/mission lead retains overall authority and responsibility.
1.6. Experienced (EXP) Aircrew Requirements. Crewmembers are designated as experienced
based on the minimum hour requirements in Table 1.1 Both total and B-1 hours must be met
before designating an individual as experienced. Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT),
Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT), and Undergraduate Combat System Officer Training
(UCT) student time is not included in total hours. All instructors are considered experienced.
   1.6.1. SQ/CCs may elect to retain an individual meeting the minimum requirements as
   inexperienced if designation as experienced is not warranted. SQ/CCs may return an
   individual to inexperienced status at any time.
   1.6.2. When crewmembers are designated as experienced, the remaining requirements of the
   training cycle will be prorated.
   1.6.3. Hours logged in the Weapon System Trainer (WST) accomplishing RTM-approved
   missions will be counted as ―hours‖ when determining experience level. RAP WST Mission
   hours will not exceed 20% of the total B-1 hours required to meet the experienced threshold
   (ex: 100 RAP WST Mission hours out of 500 B-1 hours may be used to meet the experience
   threshold). See the current RTM for guidance on approved RAP SIM Missions and logging
   procedures.

 WSO             1,300/200, 1,000/300 or 750/500
1.7. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management.
   1.7.1. The aircrew training cycle is a 12 month cycle aligned with the Fiscal Year (FY).
   Each RAP CT status (i.e. CMR/BMC) is defined by a total number of RAP missions, broken
   down into mission types, plus specific weapons qualifications and associated events as
   determined by the MAJCOM and unit commanders.
   1.7.2. The total number of RAP missions for CMR/BMC is the primary factor for
   maintaining an individual’s CT status. The breakout of mission types is provided as a
   guideline to be followed as closely as possible. Variances in mission types may be used as a
   basis for regression as directed by the SQ/CC. Certification in a mission is determined by the
   SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individual’s capabilities.
   1.7.3. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a
   building block type mission. Each mission requires successfully completing a majority of the
   events applicable to that mission type, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2.
   1.7.4. The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated aircrew to CMR.
   1.7.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
         1.7.5.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR mission rate.
         1.7.5.2. Certification/qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at
         CMR.
         1.7.5.3. Confirmation that the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated
         number of RAP mission and event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the
         training cycle.
         1.7.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification.
         1.7.5.5. SQ/CC certification.
   1.7.6. CMR and BMC aircrew will fly the required monthly sortie rate. If unable, refer to
   Regression, paragraph 4.7
   1.7.7. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the crewmember’s experience level
   on the last day of the current training cycle.
1.8. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Mission Program Development.
   1.8.1. RTM CMR/BMC mission and event requirements (see Attachment 2) apply to CMR
   and BMC aircrew as well as those carrying special capabilities or certifications. The mission
   requirements listed in the RTM establish the minimum number of missions per training cycle
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     13


   for BMC and CMR levels of training. The RTM takes precedence over this instruction and
   may contain an updated mission and event requirements not yet incorporated in Attachment
   2.
   1.8.2. Experience or Cost of Business sortie requirements should be considered when
   developing unit flying hour programs (FHP). These sorties are not directly related to combat
   employment training but are necessary in day-to-day unit operations. These include, but are
   not limited to, instructor sorties, ferry flights, orientation/incentive flights, deployments, and
   air shows. The MAJCOM, when able, will allocate flying hours to the unit for these
   purposes.
   1.8.3. Unit FHPs can be allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate for non-
   effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie, is planned
   and flown, but a majority of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished due to
   poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties, it
   is essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.
1.9. Training Records and Reports.
   1.9.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluation IAW:
      1.9.1.1. AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
      1.9.1.2. AFI 11-202 Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
      1.9.1.3. AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records (and disposed of in accordance with
      the      Air   Force      Records      Disposition   Schedule      located    at
      https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
      1.9.1.4. ACCI 11-464, Training Records and Performance Evaluation in Formal Flying
      Training Programs.
      1.9.1.5. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
      1.9.1.6. Appropriate MAJCOM directives.
   1.9.2. Units will track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable):
      1.9.2.1. Required ground training.
      1.9.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual missions, RAP missions,
      mission types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
      1.9.2.3. RAP mission requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month
      running totals for lookback.
      1.9.2.4. Currencies.
      1.9.2.5. Weapons employment records in sufficient detail to document all employment
      attempts as well as to compute Circular Error Probable (CEP) and event hit percentage
      histories.
   1.9.3. Units may use the crewmember’s individual training summary (ITS) with either the
   date of the last FTU or United States Air Force Weapons School (USAFWS) equivalent
   event accomplished to update training requirements in ARMS . The ITS will be used only to
 14                                                     AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


   update dates for training event frequency. Proration of RAP training requirements will be
   IAW with paragraph 4.9
   1.9.4. Periodic and End-of-Cycle Training Reports. Guidance and templates can be
   found               at             ACC/A3TO’s            Sharepoint           at
   https://acc.eim.acc.af.mil/org/A3/A3T/A3TO/default.aspx.
       1.9.4.1. Periodic Training Reports. Squadrons will submit a training report to HQ
       ACC/A3TO every 4th month during the training cycle (always on the 15th day of Feb,
       Jun, and Oct). Squadrons may submit an out of cycle report at anytime if higher HQ
       assistance is required to prepare for DOC or deployment tasking.
          1.9.4.1.1. Reports will consist of:
              1.9.4.1.1.1. A commander’s memorandum summarizing previous report
              results/issues, current training plan summary, and significant shortfalls/limiting
              factors (LIMFACS) affecting training.
              1.9.4.1.1.2. A completed squadron training health slide (attachment to
              commander’s memo) summarizing critical training issues.
       1.9.4.2. End-of-Cycle Reports. Squadrons will submit an end-of-cycle training report
       each 12-month training cycle. Report all deviations from the training requirements in this
       instruction and the B-1 RTM, after proration, to ACC/A3T at the end of the training
       cycle. Include in the report all training requirements waived by the OG/CC. Squadrons
       planned to deploy during the reporting period will submit an end-of-cycle report prior to
       deployment.
       1.9.4.3. Shortfall and LIMFAC Reporting. Units should report significant
       shortfalls/LIMFACS that affect most or all of the squadron for prolonged periods of time.
       Include possible solutions or specific assistance required if able. HQ ACC will attempt
       to rectify or minimize noted shortfalls/LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way.
          1.9.4.3.1. Shortfalls. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
          accomplished due to shortages of equipment, munitions, ARMS software, etc.
          Example: unable to accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of weapons.
          1.9.4.3.2. LIMFACS. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that
          degrade training effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual
          weapons release is limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop
          munitions. This may include support hardware and software.
1.10. Weapons Delivery Recording.
   1.10.1. Aircrew should use and assess all available training aids including Removable
   Memory Module (RMM) data, Common Mission Debrief Program (CMDP) data, targeting
   pod (TGP) video, and Weapon Impact Scoring Set (WISS) data on all tactical missions.
   Aircrew should review their delivery data with crewmembers in their flight.
   1.10.2. As a guide, the following items should be reviewed: weapons delivery parameters,
   accuracy, adherence to Training Rules (TR), flight discipline, and tactical employment.
1.11. Aircrew Utilization Policy.
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                       15


     1.11.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group tactical crewmembers (API-1/-2/-6s) fill
     authorized positions IAW unit manning documents (UMD) and that aircrew status is properly
     designated. The overall objective is that crewmembers perform combat-related duties.
     Supervisors may assign crewmembers to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, Flying
     Evaluation Board /mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors
     involved, such as level of crewmember tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
     For inexperienced crewmembers in the first year of their initial operational assignment,
     supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to combat activities.
     1.11.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API-1/-2
     crewmembers are weapons and tactics officer, scheduler, flight safety officer (FSO),
     supervisor of flying (SOF), mobility/ contingency plans, training (except ARMS
     documentation), SQ standardization/evaluation liaison officer (SELO), aircrew flight
     equipment officer (AFEO), electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related to
     flying operations. In some instances, such as squadron-assigned FSOs, API-1/-2s may be
     attached to the wing or group. API-1/-2s will not be attached to wing or group staffs or man
     wing or group staff positions unless total wing aircrew API-1/-2 manning is 100 percent or
     better. CCs will ensure wing staff crewmembers (API-6) perform duties justified in
     MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.
     1.11.3. Crewmembers will not perform long-term duties that detract from their primary
     duties of training for or performing the unit flying mission.
1.12. Sortie Allocation and Unit Manpower Guidance.
     1.12.1. In general, inexperienced API-1/-2 aircrew should receive mission allocation priority
     over experienced aircrew. Priorities for mission allocation are as follows:
        1.12.1.1. FTU and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, CMR/API-1/-2, instructor

   6.5) and/or Single-Ship Mission Lead (SML) upgrade (paragraph 6.6) entering
   requalification may complete the upgrade training during requalification with FTU SQ/CC
   approval. NOTE: A crewmember is unqualified upon expiration of his or her qualification
   evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (see 4.5.1.3.2), or completion of a
   qualification evaluation in a different MDS (Exception: authorized multiple qualifications in
   aircraft). Use landing currency for pilots and weapon delivery currency for WSOs to
   determine when the crewmember became non-current due to PCS.
2.9. Senior Staff Qualification Course (SSQC).
   2.9.1. SSQC provides senior staff officers and military test pilot school (TPS) graduates with
   academics, simulator and flight training that result in BAQ status after successful completion
   of the course at the FTU. The course requires completion of an instrument check (pilot only)
   and qualification level flight evaluation for senior staff officers. If a graduate of SSQC
   requires a BMC or higher status, then the graduate’s gaining flying unit will provide the
   training required for the higher status.
      2.9.1.1. At a minimum, graduates must complete all IQC/TX-1 flight training events
      prior to upgrading to BMC or higher status. Number of sorties required will be tailored to
      each individual’s training needs. Air Refueling, Terrain Following/Low Level
      Procedures, and Weapons Delivery Procedures will require special emphasis as part of
      the upgrade training since only limited training is provided in these areas during SSQC.
      All CMR/BMC training may be conducted by the graduate’s gaining flying unit.
      2.9.1.2. Academic and flight training accomplished during SSQC applies toward upgrade
      to CMR/BMC.
      2.9.1.3. Gaining units may require additional MQT training items to complete upgrade to
      CMR/BMC.
   2.9.2. If senior officers are in training at the FTU and assigned to the same wing, they will
   be placed in formal training status, and unit duties will be turned over to the appropriate
   deputies or vice commanders until training is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be
   approved by the ACC/A3.
   2.9.3. Prerequisites and time limitations are listed in ETCA https://etca.randolph.af.mil

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit developed training program that
upgrades newly assigned crewmembers to CMR or BMC to accomplish the unit mission.
Guidance in this chapter will be used to develop a unit’s MQT program. Units may tailor this
program for all crewmembers, based on experience, currency, documented performance, and
formal training. All training events accomplished to the required proficiency level at the FTU are
creditable (if applicable) for MQT. Accomplish waived FTU proficiency items prior to declaring
the individual CMR or BMC. Units may credit training events accomplished during in-unit
requalification toward MQT requirements provided proficiency was obtained in the event.
   3.1.1. Local MQT programs should consist only of ground and flight training applicable to
   unit taskings. Upon completion of this training, the SQ/CC will certify aircrew CMR or
   BMC.
   3.1.2. Crewmembers will complete MQT within 90 calendar days after the completion of
   squadron in-processing. Units will notify ACC/A3T with a memorandum for record if
   training exceeds the 90-day time period or there is a delay beginning MQT (e.g., due to
   security clearance) that exceeds 30 days. Entry into MQT and training will start no later than
   7 workdays after the crewmember has arrived on base and has been cleared for flying duties.
   If the crewmember elects to take leave prior to entering MQT, the timing will begin after the
   termination of the crewmember’s leave. Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification to
   CMR or BMC.
   3.1.3. CMR/BMC Certification. A crewmember will be reported as CMR/BMC once
   certified as CMR/BMC by the SQ/CC, Crewmembers reported as CMR/BMC after the 15th
   of the month are considered to be in continuation training on the first day of the following
   month for RAP proration and RAP lookback purposes. Prior to CMR/BMC certification, a
   crewmember must complete:
       3.1.3.1. Night/Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) Terrain Following (TF)
       certification (see paragraph 3.7).
       3.1.3.2. LASDT Category IB (see paragraph 3.6).
       3.1.3.3. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) certification (see paragraph 6.3).
       3.1.3.4. Initial weapons certification (see paragraph 5.2).
       3.1.3.5. Targeting pod mission certification (see paragraph 6.4). Targeting pod mission
       certification may be deferred by SQ/CC if resources are unavailable; however,
       crewmembers will be at a minimum targeting pod safety of flight certified (see
       paragraph 6.4).
   3.1.4. Transferring Between Units. Units may accept certifications, qualifications, and flight
   evaluations from other MAJCOMs and units, if they meet the gaining MAJCOM’s and unit’s
   standards. The gaining SQ/CC will determine the MQT training requirements for CMR or
   BMC crewmembers transferring between units based on experience, proficiency, currency,
 22                                                       AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


   and previous formal training. At a minimum, crewmembers transferring between units will
   receive the unit’s mission briefing.
3.2. Ground Training.
   3.2.1. Units will provide blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the unit’s mission
   as determined by the SQ/CC. Units may credit training accomplished during IQT towards
   this requirement. Ground training will include, but is not limited to:
       3.2.1.1. Unit tasking.
       3.2.1.2. Threat and tactics study IAW unit DOC statements.
       3.2.1.3. Unit missions, tactics and employment IAW applicable Joint Publications and
       AFTTPs.
       3.2.1.4. Chemical Defense Training.
       3.2.1.5. Local Area Survival (See AFI 16-1301, SERE Training).
       3.2.1.6. Simulator Console Operator Training (See paragraph 6.13)
   3.2.2. Combat Planning Exercises (CPEX). Crewmembers will complete two CPEXs.
   Crewmembers will demonstrate to an instructor satisfactory mission planning set skills using
   one of the B-1 current RAP mission sets.
       3.2.2.1. Standoff Weapons (SOW). Objective: Crewmembers will complete one AGM-
       158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) combat planning exercise This
       practical exercise focuses on developing mission-planning cell (MPC) planning skills to
       solve a tactical problem. At the conclusion of the exercise, the crewmember will be
       prepared to take part in JASSM attack-planning activities. Objectives: Apply B-1 JASSM
       planning to mission plan a standoff weapon strike.
       3.2.2.2. Multi-Desired Mean Point of Impact (DMPI) JDAM. Objective: Upon
       completion of CPEX the crewmember will be able to accomplish preplanned JDAM
       considerations for a 2-ship strike to include rotation time, fuse options, target priorities,
       and DMPI organization.
3.3. Initial Verification. Crewmembers will complete initial verification within 90 days after
completing MQT. Failure to comply will result in regression to Non-CMR/Non-BMC until
verification is complete. Attachment 3 contains the suggested verification briefing guide. Each
crewmember will demonstrate to a formal board a satisfactory knowledge of the unit’s assigned
mission and the tactical considerations for employing this mission in a realistic combat threat
environment. The SQ/CC will establish the board composition.
3.4. Simulator Training. Crewmembers will complete three simulator missions. MQT
crewmembers should fly the missions outlined below as typical RAP profiles. Each simulator
mission will include selected critical action emergency procedures and instrument procedures.
Mission types are defined in Attachment 2.
   3.4.1. WST MQT-Standoff Weapons and Dynamic Targeting (DT). Objective: Mission
   designed to strike pre-fragged and dynamic targets with guided weapons, unguided weapons,
   and JASSM in opposed target areas, using single-ship and/or formation tactics.
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  23


   3.4.2. WST MQT-Integrated Tactics. Objective: Mission designed to increase effectiveness
   through the integration of multiple assets and capabilities. Integrated tactics require
   coordination with other C2, OCA, SEAD, and/or strike assets to effectively utilize,
   deconflict, and manage package assets. Long-haul DMO is required for mission completion.
   3.4.3. WST MQT-Close Air Support. Objective: Mission designed to strike targets in close
   proximity to ground forces, in a semi-permissive threat environment, using single-ship and/or
   formation tactics. Emphasis is on detailed coordination with ground parties while under
   positive control of a simulated or actual Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) to find, fix,
   track, target, engage, and assess static and mobile targets. Long-haul DMO is desired for
   mission completion.
3.5. Flight Training. Units will use missions listed below as a baseline to build the local MQT
program to certify a crewmember to CMR or BMC. Unit-developed MQT programs should use
profiles typical of squadron missions found in Attachment 2. The mission objectives are to
expose crewmembers to the various aspects of the unit mission and train them to required
proficiency so they can accomplish the mission unsupervised. Units will use the following
elements, listed in no particular order, as a guide and adjust them based on unit DOC tasking.
   3.5.1. LAO/Instrument. The Local Area Orientation (LAO)/Instrument element is mandatory
   for pilots and will be accomplished in conjunction with the pilot’s first MQT sortie in the
   local area unless the pilot is flying in the same local area as in IQT or RQT. Objectives:
   Familiarization with local area requirements and local instrument procedures. Specific Tasks:
   Local area familiarization, emergency airfield(s) overflight/approach(es) if available, and
   local instrument procedures.
   3.5.2. MQT Sortie Profiles.
       3.5.2.1. MQT-Low Altitude Training (LOWAT) Ingress Surface Attack. Objective: Plan
       and execute LOWAT ingress to multi-DMPI guided weapons employment in an opposed
       threat environment. Specific Mission Tasks: Intel scenario, mission planning, opposed
       ingress, threat detection, threat reaction, TGP, and weapons employment IAW Unit
       Committed Munitions List (UCML).
       3.5.2.2. MQT-Close Air Support. Objective: Plan and execute CAS mission with
       simulated or actual guided weapons. Specific Mission Tasks: Plan with intel/ground
       liaison officer (GLO) for orbit management, communications with, and targeting
       hierarchy and engagement with an actual or simulated JTAC.
       3.5.2.3. MQT-Surface Attack. Objective: Plan and execute low or medium altitude
       ingress to guided or unguided weapons employment in an opposed threat environment.
       Specific Mission Tasks: Intel scenario, mission planning, opposed ingress, threat
       detection, threat reaction, TGP and weapons employment IAW unit UCML. MQT WSO
       will occupy the DSO position.
3.6. Low Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT).
   3.6.1. To conduct low altitude operations safely, crewmembers need to be knowledgeable of
   aircraft handling and performance characteristics, visual formation, defensive maneuvering,
   and basic navigation. Operations in the low altitude environment require a well-supervised
   LASDT program, including initial certification and currency requirements. LASDT
 24                                                          AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


     completion certifies crewmembers to conduct Low Altitude Training (LOWAT) at or below
     1,000 feet AGL. LOWAT category certification is required prior to performing unsupervised
     operations at altitudes commensurate with that category. All crewmembers will accomplish
     Low Altitude Awareness Training (LAAT) academics. Pilots require flight training prior to
     being certified. WSO LASDT flight training requirements are at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
     3.6.2. The LASDT program is a sequential, multi-phase training process that will be
     accomplished IAW Table 3.1 There is no time limit to progress beyond LOWAT Category I
     and progress will be based upon individual pilot proficiency and training availability.
     LOWAT Category II should be accomplished at the pilot’s earliest opportunity. A pilot shall
     be LOWAT Category IIA certified prior to becoming an aircraft commander. Progression
     through the step-down training program is based on instructor/squadron supervisor
     assessment of aircrew performance, training rules (TR) compliance, and judgment. An IP or
     squadron supervisor who has completed LASDT will supervise all LASDT missions.

Notes:
1. A pilot LOWAT Category IA certified may conduct flight in LOWAT Category IB if the pilot
in command (PIC) is certified LOWAT Category IB. Actual LOWAT Category IB certification
requires IP supervision IAW paragraph 3.6.2.
2. A pilot LOWAT Category IIA certified may conduct flight in LOWAT Category IIB if both
PICs in formation are certified LOWAT Category IIB. Actual LOWAT Category IIB
certification requires IP supervision IAW paragraph 3.6.2.
     3.6.3. Demonstrated proficiency down to 1,000 feet AGL is required for LOWAT Category I
     certification and is normally accomplished during IQT and/or MQT. Category I certification
     is a minimum requirement for CMR status. Category III training may not be conducted
     during MQT.
     3.6.4. Entry into LASDT requires SQ/CC approval. The SQ/CC determines the LOWAT
     category a pilot is certified to based on the lowest altitude that all tasks can be comfortably
     performed and proficiency demonstrated. The goal is proficiency down to the minimum
     altitude compatible with squadron mission. Upon successful completion of LASDT training,
     the SQ/CC will certify the pilot to the minimum approved altitude of the LOWAT category.
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 25


  Squadrons may accept documented LASDT certification for pilots coming from other
  units/commands. With SQ/CC approval, low altitude training conducted at a B-1 formal
  training course may be used to fulfill applicable requirements of this paragraph.
  3.6.5. LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as a primary portion of the mission.
  Crewmembers may accomplish compatible RAP CT events in conjunction with LASDT as
  long as the events meet LASDT sortie objectives. Crewmembers will not fly LASDT as an
  alternate mission. IPs/FLs must be aware of the added stress and task loading associated with
  low altitude operations and provide breaks in training above the training altitude. Training
  profiles will be developed to avoid over-tasking the upgrading pilot, and upgrade sortie
  continuity should be emphasized.
  3.6.6. Ground Training. Ground training will be built to support the mission and concept of
  operations of the individual squadron, incorporating appropriate portions of AFTTP 3-1.B-1,
  Tactic Employment-- B-1, and AFTTP 3-3.B-1, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals--B-1.
  Crewmembers will complete all academic training prior to flight training/briefing.
     3.6.6.1. Low Altitude Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC). Discuss aircraft
     performance as it applies to the low altitude environment, to include:
         3.6.6.1.1. Control response (SEF, Hinge Moment Limiter (HML), low/ high speed,
         over-G potential, speed brake use, use of rudder, stores effects).
         3.6.6.1.2. Acceleration/deceleration to include afterburner use (fuel considerations,
         selection techniques).
         3.6.6.1.3. Level turns, vertical maneuvering, climb/dive, recoveries, effects of gross
         weight, power settings, density altitude, G-loading, and bank angles.
         3.6.6.1.4. Terrain avoidance (ridge crossings), terrain clearance versus turning room,
         and dangers inherent in over-banking during turns.
     3.6.6.2. Environmental factors. Discuss out-of-cockpit visibility and Field of View
     (FOV) restrictions, sun angle, terrain features, terrain and G-excess illusions/perceptions,
     air turbulence, weather considerations, and bird strike.
     3.6.6.3. Task       management.       Discuss    low   altitude  tasks  and    task
     management/prioritization concept; the importance of frequent crosscheck of aircraft
     attitude relative to horizon; and the video "How Low Can You Go?".
     3.6.6.4. Low Altitude Formation. Discuss formations, hazards at low altitudes, task
     prioritization, tactical turns, visual lookout/mutual support and formation deconfliction
     during threat reactions.
     3.6.6.5. Defensive maneuvering. Discuss visual lookout and mutual support, threat
     weapons systems envelopes, and defensive maneuvering against air-to-air and surface-to-
     air threats.
     3.6.6.6. Additional factors affecting low altitude awareness to include airmanship and
     pilot responsibilities, individual proficiency, route familiarity and complacency, route
     obstacles, planning and chum responsibilities.
     3.6.6.7. Special subjects to include training rules, aircraft emergencies, and weather abort
     procedures.

     3.6.7. LASDT Flight Profiles. Each LASDT Flight Profile is intended to demonstrate visual
     proficiency in low altitude awareness and maneuvering at designated altitude. Prior to each
     LASDT Flight Profile the preflight briefing will include a review of wings level/over
     bank/under-G/TTI & TTR charts, dive recovery charts, AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules
     and Procedures training rules (TR), and anticipated environmental conditions/hazards. Flight
     events will include, but are not limited to, low altitude visual navigation leg, altitude
     awareness and control, offensive maneuvering, defensive maneuvering, low altitude weapons
     delivery considerations, and visual crosscheck/lookout. If terrain is available terrain masking
     and ridge crossings should also be flown.

 Notes:
 1. Profile will include a TTI/TTR demonstration. Accomplish the demonstration with a floor
 of 1,000 feet AGL,
 2. Not required if already formation certified to 500 feet via the Visual Formation checkout
 program in paragraph 6.2.
 3. Authorized for Stream formation only.
 4. A pilot(s) LOWAT Category IB certified may fly LASDT Profile 5 and subsequently be
 certified LOWAT Category IIB by an IP in the opposing aircraft of a formation given both
 pilots are at least LOWAT IB Certified.
3.7. Night/IMC TF Initial Certification Training.
     3.7.1. The certification requirements listed below are mandatory unless previously
     accomplished at the FTU. Units may apply all training accomplished to proficiency at the
     FTU towards these requirements. Requalifying crewmembers previously certified to
     minimum set clearance plane (SCP) in night/IMC TF may retain this certification once they
     regain proficiency in Night/IMC TF.
     3.7.2. Academics. Academics will include TF system and procedures review, Vertical
     Situation Display (VSD) interpretation, crew coordination, TF limitations, checklist
     procedures/use, and safety considerations. Failure to complete this training during the MQT
     time period requires training as directed by the SQ/CC. Training need not be restarted in all
     cases since the amount of retraining is based on individual experience and previous exposure
     to Night/IMC TF operations.
     3.7.3. Simulator Training. Complete one WST/Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT) mission
     emphasizing crew coordination, systems malfunctions, and TF procedures (including
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     27


   demonstration of flyup recovery proficiency). Complete this WST/CPT before starting flight
   training. This WST may not be combined with any other MQT night simulator. For units
   without a WST, an in-depth discussion of system malfunctions will be included in
   academics.
   3.7.4. Flight Training
       3.7.4.1. Pilot Flight Training. A minimum of two instructor supervised night/IMC TF
       flights, both of which should be mountainous, are required for initial flight certification.
       Each flight must include 10 minutes of night/IMC TF to be creditable. After initial flight
       certification pilots must complete a minimum of four 10-minute mountainous Night/IMC
       TF navigational legs, of which no more than two navigational legs may be completed in
       the WST, at 1,000 feet SCP prior to being cleared for minimum SCP altitudes during
       night/IMC. After completing this requirement, an instructor or squadron supervisor pilot
       must fly mountainous Night/IMC TF with the crewmember to verify required proficiency
       prior to the individual being cleared to fly AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 3, B-1 Operations
       Procedures, minimum SCPs.
       3.7.4.2. WSO Flight Training. WSOs require a minimum of two IWSO supervised
       night/IMC TF flights, both of which should be over mountainous terrain, for initial flight
       certification. At least one flight must be in the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO) seat.
       Each flight must include 10 minutes of night/IMC TF and a flyup to be creditable.
       3.7.4.3. Night Terrain Following (NTF) SCPs are tied to the least certified pilot. If any
       crewmember has not completed the final proficiency demonstration flight with an
       instructor, the crew is restricted to 1,000 feet SCP. Exception: Crews may fly minimum
       SCP altitudes if the WSO/OSO has completed initial flight certification or is under
       supervision of an IWSO, and the aircraft commander/pilot is under the supervision of an
       IP certified at minimum route altitudes.
3.8. Flight Surgeon. IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1units will provide assigned and attached flight
surgeons every opportunity to fly in the unit’s aircraft.
   3.8.1. Ground Training. Flight surgeons will ensure completion of AFI 11-202 Volume 2
   qualification requirements as verified by the squadron Stan/Eval function and recorded in
   ARMs. Flight surgeons who are assigned to tactical units and who have not previously flown
   the unit-assigned aircraft will accomplish the following training IAW AFI 11-202 Volume
   1before the initial flight briefing:
       3.8.1.1. Aircraft general review.
       3.8.1.2. Hanging harness training, egress training, protective equipment training.
       3.8.1.3. CRM training, a bold face/critical action test, and an instrument/emergency
       procedures (EP) simulator with an IWSO (1 hour minimum).
   3.8.2. Flight Training. A flight surgeon’s first flight in the unit-assigned aircraft will be with
   an instructor WSO and may be flown in conjunction with other training sorties. The briefing
   and sortie will emphasize crew coordination, communications and equipment, instrument
   interpretation, and the aircraft’s performance envelope.

  4.1.4. FTU/USAFWS/Test Instructor Aircrew Requirements.
     4.1.4.1. API-1/-2/-6 instructors assigned or attached to Primary Training Aircraft
     Inventory (PTAI) (formerly TF) or Primary Development/Test Aircraft Inventory (PDAI)
     (formerly CB or Test) coded units will fly at the BMC sortie rate for lookback and are
     only required to accomplish the BMC Basic Skills WST requirements as noted in the B-1
     RTM. In addition to RAP missions listed in the RTM, formal training syllabus-directed
     missions and approved test plan missions apply to lookback. SQ/CCs may desire to track
     mission, enabler and event data for assigned aircrew based on vulnerability to convert to
     CMR status.
     4.1.4.2. As long as AFI 11-202 Volume 2, and AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 2 periodic
     instructor evaluation requirements are met, instructors failing to accomplish Basic Skills
     requirements will not lose instructor qualification, but will require additional training as
     determined by the SQ/CC prior to performing instructor duties in the delinquent event.
     4.1.4.3. Flight Training. Unit or SQ/CC will direct additional sorties if programmed
     syllabus or test missions do not provide sufficient aircrew proficiency training.
     4.1.4.4. Weapons Events. Crewmembers weapons delivery certified will maintain
     appropriate weapons delivery currencies. Instructors must be initially qualified in the
     weapons events they plan to instruct.

           supporting SQ/CC, SQ/DO or authorized representative prior to flights with that
           squadron.
           4.1.5.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission, and in coordination with squadron
           supervision, determine that their ability and proficiency will not be exceeded.
       4.1.5.4. Instructor-qualified crewmembers may perform instructor duties with the
       concurrence of the OG/CC.
   4.1.6. Flight Surgeon Requirements. Flight surgeons may fly selected tactical missions to
   enhance understanding of tactical missions with which they are directly associated. Initial
   checkouts will be IAW paragraph 3.8 Flight surgeon flying rates and requirements will be
   IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
4.2. Ground Training. Unit commanders will ensure aircrews accomplish academic and
ground training requirements. Commanders may direct additional training as necessary to ensure
all aircrew attain and maintain a state of proficiency permitting immediate and successful
completion of the assigned mission. An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that
academic training requirement. Ground training accomplished at the FTU or USAFWS may be
credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. See
Ground Training Requirements located in paragraph 6a. of the B-1B RAP Tasking
Memorandum.
   4.2.1. Aircrew Training Device.
       4.2.1.1. The B-1 RTM depicts the minimum training requirements. MAJCOMs will
       determine the minimum number/type of Aircrew Training Device (ATD) missions that
       require supervision. Units should determine additional CT training device supervision
       requirements based on expected employment tasking, and mission training objectives.
       4.2.1.2. Units with WSTs will ensure scenarios are based on expected employment
       tasking and training device capabilities. Emphasize training not easily attainable during
       daily flying activities, to include operations in contested electromagnetic spectrum (EMS)
       environments, system malfunctions, and emergency procedures.
       4.2.1.3. Simulator Certification (SIMCERT). Det 4, 29 TSS will certify the WST to
       command standards before crediting transfer of task learning from the aircrew training
       device to the aircrew. Flight evaluation completion may be accomplished per AFI 11-
       2B-1V2, B-1 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, for events certified Code 1 through
       SIMCERT. Certified Code 1 RAP events accomplished in the WST may be credited
       towards training cycle requirements and may be used to update currency, where
       applicable. Refer to Table 4.4. for currency events that can be updated in the WST. Each
       RAP mission shall run as an integrated crew, using full motion to the maximum extent
       possible.
   4.2.2. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
       4.2.2.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
       procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. The
       crew should present a situation and discuss actions necessary to cope with the
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 31


     malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion. Critical action procedures (if applicable)
     and squadron special interest items should be emphasized.
     4.2.2.2. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
         4.2.2.2.1. Discuss at least one EP during the SEPT session.
         4.2.2.2.2. Accomplish three SEPT sessions each training cycle with an instructor.
     4.2.2.3. Crewmembers will accomplish one SEPT every month. SEPT currency will
     expire at the end of the month if accomplished before the 20th or at the end of the
     following month if accomplished on or after the 21st (expiration is a grounding item until
     SEPT accomplished).
     4.2.2.4. Crewmembers may accomplish SEPT in the WST, if available. If SEPT is not
     accomplished in the WST, it should be accomplished as small, flight-sized groups to
     allow all crewmembers to participate and share equal time responding to emergency
     situations.
     4.2.2.5. Completion of a WST Emergency Procedure (EP) profile satisfies the monthly
     SEPT requirement. For IP/EP/IWSO/EWSO administering the WST EP Sim will satisfy
     their SEPT requirement.
     4.2.2.6. Formal course student SEPT satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement for the
     instructor who administers this training.
  4.2.3. Weapons/Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons and tactics
  academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Squadron Commanders
  will provide guidance to unit weapons shops on an annual CT weapons and tactics academics
  program that will ensure all aircrew are informed of new and current weapons, systems,
  mission-specific TTPs, and enemy TTPs, to include operations in contested electromagnetic
  spectrum (EMS) environments.
     4.2.3.1. USAFWS graduates are the preferred academic instructors.
     4.2.3.2. Training is required once each training cycle.
  4.2.4. Verification Training. Verification is designed to incorporate all wartime related
  aircrew training events and provide the experience necessary to plan for the unit’s wartime
  mission. Unit weapons officer will establish a training program to support initial and CT
  requirements. Attachment 3 contains the suggested areas to be included in the academic
  training courseware.
     4.2.4.1. Theater Training is one unit of instruction within verification training. Complete
     appropriate theater training before operating in deployed overseas locations. Should
     contingencies preclude theater training before deployment, orientation training packages
     will be deployed with the aircrews.
     4.2.4.2. Continuation Verification. Continuation verification, updates aircrew on their
     squadron’s wartime mission. Each crewmember will participate in unit
     initial/continuation verification every 12 months as a briefer, board member, or seminar
     participant. Aircrew that participates in a unit deployment to a DOC tasked theater of
     operations may receive credit for continuation verification.

     4.2.4.3. BMC aircrew may accomplish an initial verification and/or participate in CT
     verifications to facilitate future upgrade to CMR status, at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
  4.2.5. Intelligence. (IAW AFI 14-105, Unit Intelligence Mission and Responsibilities, and
  MAJCOM supplements) The intelligence training program will be developed in coordination
  with the unit’s weapons and tactics training program. The focus and extent of academic
  training will be determined by the OG/CC and will be aligned with projected wartime
  tasking, threats, and unit equipage. Supervisory personnel above squadron level maintaining
  mission qualification do not require this item.
     4.2.5.1. Training items will include, but are not limited to, primary adversary weapons
     systems that affect execution of the unit mission, evasion and recovery (E&R), collection
     and reporting, visual recognition, and current intelligence. The unit training plan will
     ensure that each training item is taught at least twice per training cycle, once during the
     first six months of the training cycle and once during the second six months. Training
     methods may include, but are not limited to, threat-of-the day briefings, weapons and
     tactics academics, theater orientation briefings, weapons system videos, etc.
     4.2.5.2. Collection and Reporting (C&R) training enables aircrew to initiate aircrew
     originated reports; Inflight Report (INFLTREP), and Communication Instructions
     Reporting Vital Intelligence Sighting (CIRVIS). Training will familiarize them with the
     information requirements of the intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and
     Intelligence Report (INTREP).
     4.2.5.3. Current Intelligence will cover significant military/political developments
     (including threat updates) in the squadron’s mission areas of interest.
     4.2.5.4. Isolated Personnel Reports (ISOPREP). Every person subject to
     flight/participation in an employment mission must have a current, accurate, ISOPREP
     card, DD Form 1833, Isolated Personnel Reports, on file. During readiness, ISOPREPs
     will be reviewed IAW paragraph 6a. of the B-1B RAP Tasking Message. During
     operations, personnel will review ISOPREPs prior to their first mission of the day and as
     often as necessary thereafter to maintain knowledge of its content.
  4.2.6. Crew Resource Management (CRM). Each crewmember is required to participate
  in one training session every 24 months IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource
  Management Training Program. Additionally, instructor/evaluator aircrew must accomplish
  the CRM Instructor/Evaluator Training Course (one time requirement) prior to instructor
  certification. Waiver authority for this requirement is the OG/CC.
  4.2.7. Communications Training. Units will establish a communications training program
  IAW AFI 33-201 Volume 1, Communications Security (COMSEC), to satisfy CT
  requirements.
  4.2.8. Electronic Combat (EC) Training. The purpose of Electronic Combat Training is to
  ensure all WSOs possess the knowledge and skills necessary to employ their aircraft’s EC
  equipment against known threat systems. Aircrew training devices will be employed to the
  maximum extent possible. Each WSO is required to participate in one training session every
  12 months. Specific objectives include:
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  33


       4.2.8.1. EC related threat system information to include signal analysis, capabilities,
       limitations, strengths, weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
       4.2.8.2. Aircraft EC systems hardware and software capabilities and limitations.
       4.2.8.3. Signal ambiguity resolution.
       4.2.8.4. Electronic Attack (EA) techniques and application.
       4.2.8.5. EC related issues to include training and operational guidance.
   4.2.9. Aircraft Servicing. Training ensures crewmembers have the knowledge to service,
   safe weapons, and reconfigure the aircraft for launch after landing. Each crewmember is
   required to participate in one training session every 12 months. The Aircraft Servicing video
   can      be      found      at     the      ACC      TRSS,      Detachment       14     CoP:
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AC-OP-01-89
   4.2.10. NVG Academics. Each pilot is required to participate in one training session every
   24 months IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1. This training may be conducted in conjunction with
   CT Weapons/Tactics academic training. Refresher training as a minimum will consist of
   common NVG hazards, MDS specific hazards, spatial disorientation, limitations and
   performing preflight adjustment procedures and focusing on an eye chart or the use of a
   Hoffman 20/20 tester. The use of a mock-up terrain display is encouraged for this training.
4.3. Flight Training. All aircrew will accomplish the requirements found in the B-1 RTM as
applicable. Failure to accomplish these annual requirements will not affect BAQ, BMC, or CMR
status but may require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC.
4.4. Multiple Qualification/Currency.
   4.4.1. MAJCOM A3 may authorize qualification in more than one mission design series
   (MDS) aircraft for a crewmember only when such action is directed by command mission
   requirements and is economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below
   MAJCOM level. Unless required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not
   permit crewmembers qualified in primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in
   support aircraft
       4.4.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to MAJCOM
       A3T. All requests must contain full justification. Approval for multiple qualification
       requests must be provided to the appropriate host base flight management office. Flight
       accomplishments are not authorized until aircraft assignment is updated into ARMS.
       4.4.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the
       crewmember is assigned to the specific position, and aircraft requested, or rescinded by
       MAJCOM A3.
   4.4.2. Multiple qualifications are not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
   different types of aircraft. Wing Commanders will qualify in only one of their wing’s aircraft.
   Either the WG/CV or OG/CC should qualify in another of the wing’s aircraft (not the same
   one selected by the WG/CC).
   4.4.3. Multiple Requirements: Crewmembers will satisfy at least 50 percent of sortie
   requirements in their primary aircraft. If CMR, they will meet all RAP sortie/event
   requirements of the primary aircraft. In addition, the crewmember will fly an equitable
 34                                                       AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


   distribution of emergency patterns, instrument sorties, penetrations, non-precision
   approaches, and precision approaches in each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements.
   4.4.4. Multiple Currencies: Crewmember will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft.
   They will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
   4.4.5. Crewmember must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus.
4.5. Currencies, Recurrencies, and Requalification.
   4.5.1. Currency.

Table 4.1. defines currency requirements for B-1 aircrews.
   4.5.2. Recurrency.
      4.5.2.1. Recurrency is required whenever a crewmember exceeds a currency requirement
      in this instruction. To regain currency a crewmember must demonstrate proficiency with
      an instructor of like specialty except as noted on Table 4.1
      4.5.2.2. Overdue training requirements must be satisfied before the crewmember is
      considered qualified to perform tasks applicable to the type of training in which
      delinquent. Training annotated as affecting CMR or BMC status will require regression
      to N-CMR or N-BMC until appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC is accomplished.
      Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR
      although it may result in grounding until training is completed (e.g., life support training).
      The duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on
      CMR status.
      4.5.2.3. Regaining currency is based on time elapsed from the date the individual became
      non-current. NOTE: Use landing currency (P) and weapon delivery (W) currency to
      determine when the individual became non-current.
          4.5.2.3.1. Up to 180 days: Training as directed by the SQ/CC and crewmember must
          demonstrate proficiency in all delinquent events with an instructor of like specialty.
          4.5.2.3.2. Over 180 days: A crewmember with an expired qualification evaluation
          and any currency expired as designated under Table 4.1 will be unqualified. If the
          individual crewmember is non-current for an event designated under Table 4.1 for
          over 180 days and has a current qualification evaluation, then training must be
          accomplished as directed by the SQ/CC. Individuals need to requalify only in events
          required by their training level. Flight check by an evaluator is required only for non-
          current items that would be evaluated during a Qualification evaluation as defined in
          AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 2.
   4.5.3. Requalification. NOTE: A crewmember is unqualified upon expiration of his or her
   qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (see 4.5.1.3.2), or completion
   of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (Exception: authorized multiple
   qualifications in aircraft). Use landing currency for pilots and weapon delivery currency for
   WSOs to determine when the crewmember became non-current due to PCS.
      4.5.3.1. Unqualified up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months
      at the end of any active flying assignment: Completion of an FTU requalification
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                               35


     academic course and FTU flight training (TX-2), or training as directed by the SQ/CC in-
     unit (TX-3). All training will culminate in a flight evaluation. Aircrew need to requalify
     only in events required by their training level. Flight check by an evaluator is required
     only for non-current items that would be evaluated during an initial qualification check.
     4.5.3.2. Unqualified 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months at the
     end of any active flying assignment to 8 Years: Complete an FTU requalification
     academic course (TX-2) and FTU flight training. A flight evaluation will be conducted in
     accordance with paragraph 2.7 and the B-1 Requalification Training Course Syllabus.
     4.5.3.3. Unqualified over 8 years: Individuals non-current over 8 years will complete the
     Initial Qualification Course (TX-1).
  4.5.4. Loss of Instructor Status. Instructors will be decertified if:
     4.5.4.1. They fail an evaluation. To regain instructor status, the instructor must
     successfully complete training IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 2.
     4.5.4.2. They become non-current in an event/sortie which causes removal from
     CMR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance
     to require decertification. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor
     becomes non-current in events/sorties which do not require removal from CMR/BMC
     status, instructor status may be retained, but the instructor will not instruct in that
     event/sortie until the required currency is regained.

Notes:
1.        Loss of currency greater than 180 days results in unqualified status IAW AFI 11-202V1
   2.2.
    and AFI 11-2B-1V1 4.6.
2.        For sorties without a current Instructor Pilot, both pilots must be current in the event to
   be
    flown.
3.        If non-current, currency may be regained by flying at least one precision and one non
    precision approach with a current Instructor Pilot.
4.        The designated aircraft commander must be current for the event to be flown. The non
    current Pilot will not accomplish the event.
5.        If non-current, qualified IPs may regain currency by flying at or above 2,000’ AGL.
6.        If non-current, currency may be regained by flying 3 simulated and/or actual weapon
    deliveries with an instructor of like specialty.
7.        Accomplishing the night/IMC event dual-credits the day event for currency only.
4.6. Regression (see Figure 4 1).
   4.6.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and
   contingency operations sorties may be used for lookback. If a crewmember does not meet
   lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, the SQ/CC can: regress the
   crewmember to N-CMR/N-BMC, as applicable; remove the crewmember from a CMR/BMC
   manning position; or initiate action to remove the crewmember from active flying status.
       4.6.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP lookback, either for a sortie or WST, requires a
       review of the crewmember’s respective 3-month sortie or WST history. If the 3-month
       lookback has been met, the crewmember may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC.
       Failure to meet the 3-month lookback for either sortie or WST requirements will result in
       regression to N-BMC/N-CMR, or the crewmember may be placed in probation status for
       1 month at the SQ/CC’s discretion. If probation is chosen, the only way to remove a
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   37


       crewmember from probation and preserve the current status is to reestablish a 1-month
       lookback at the end of the probation period.
       4.6.1.2. CMR crewmembers regressed to N-CMR for lookback, must complete a SQ/CC
       approved recertification program to return to CMR status. BMC crewmembers regressed
       to N-BMC must complete a SQ/CC directed recertification program. Upon completion of
       the recertification program, CMR/BMC crewmembers must also meet the subsequent 1-
       month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The sorties, WSTs,
       and events accomplished during the recertification program may be credited towards their
       total/type mission and event requirements for the training cycle as well as for their
       monthly sortie or WST requirements.
       4.6.1.3. Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. Crewmembers
       must maintain 1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is established.
   4.6.2. Regression for Failed Evaluations. In addition to the requirements of AFI 11-202
   Volume 2 and AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 2, crewmembers who fail a periodic evaluation will
   regress to N-CMR/N-BMC as applicable. Crewmembers will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until
   accomplishing AFI 11-202 Volume 2 requalification requirements and are recertified by the
   SQ/CC.
   4.6.3. Regression for Weapons Certification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons
   certification at the end of the training cycle will require:
       4.6.3.1. For events tasked as Proficient (PROF) at CMR/BMC. Regression to N-
       BMC/N-CMR. To regain CMR/BMC, the crewmember must re-achieve initial
       certification in the deficient weapons event (see paragraph 5.2), unless waived by
       OG/CC. Events accomplished for this recertification may count toward the cumulative
       CT event certification required at the end of the next training cycle.
       4.6.3.2. For events tasked as Familiarization (FAM) at CMR/BMC. Regression to
       N-BMC/ N-CMR. To regain CMR/BMC, a crewmember must accomplish at least three
       actual or simulated weapons deliveries, the first must be under the supervision of a
       squadron supervisor or instructor, unless waived by OG/CC. Events accomplished for
       this requalification may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at
       the end of the next training cycle.
   4.6.4. Crewmembers who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or instrument evaluation will
   be handled IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 2. Aircrew will regress to
   N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These crewmembers will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until
   successfully completing required corrective action, a re-evaluation, and are re-certified by the
   SQ/CC.
   4.6.5. Crewmembers that accomplish in-unit upgrade training may not be reported as CMR
   until completion of upgrade training and an AFI 11-202 Volume 2 evaluation.
4.7. End of Cycle Requirements. Crewmembers who fail to complete mission or event
requirements by the end of the training cycle may require additional training depending on the
type and magnitude of the deficiency. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is
required. Refer to paragraph 4.8 to determine if any of these requirements may be prorated. In
all cases, report training shortfalls IAW RTM instructions.
 38                                                      AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


   4.7.1. Crewmembers who fail to meet the total RAP mission requirements may continue at
   CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is
   required.
   4.7.2. Failure to meet RAP mission type requirements will result in:
      4.7.2.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the mission type is
      significant. To regain CMR/BMC, the crewmember will complete the appropriate
      number of mission types as determined by the SQ/CC. These missions may be counted
      against the total requirements for the new training cycle.
      4.7.2.2. Continuation at CMR/BMC if total RAP missions and lookback are maintained
      and the mission type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the squadron by the
      SQ/CC. The SQ/CC will determine if any additional training is required to address
      shortfall.
   4.7.3. Failure to accomplish mission required for Special Capabilities or
   Certification/Qualifications will result in loss of that certification/qualification. The SQ/CC
   will determine recertification requirements. Requalification requirements are IAW AFI 11-
   202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 2.
4.8. Proration of End of Cycle Requirements.
   4.8.1. At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC may prorate any training requirements as
   necessary for crewmembers when Duty Not Including Flight (DNIF), emergency leave, non-
   flying TDYs or exercises, and/or combat/contingency deployments preclude training for a
   portion of the training cycle. Ordinary leave will not be considered as non-availability.
   Extended bad weather or other environmental factors that precludes the unit from flying for
   more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability. The following
   guidelines apply:
      4.8.1.1. Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies.
      4.8.1.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the
      training cycle. Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on
      cumulative calendar days of non-availability.
      4.8.1.3. If IQT or MQT is reaccomplished, a crewmember’s training cycle will start over
      at a prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT training.
      4.8.1.4. No requirement may be prorated below one. Prorated numbers resulting in
      fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower whole number (one or
      greater).
      4.8.1.5. Newly assigned/converted crewmembers and crewmembers achieving
      CMR/BMC after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the
      following month for proration and lookback purposes. A prorated share of RAP missions
      must be completed in CT.
      4.8.1.6. A crewmember's last month on station prior to a Permanent Change of Station
      (PCS) may be prorated provided one month's proration is not exceeded. Crewmembers
      who are in the process of a PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposes during a
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   39


      period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or
      sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first.
      4.8.1.7. CMR crewmembers who attend FTU/USAFWS in TDY-and-return status and/or
      who participate in actual B-1 flying contingency operations may be reported throughout
      the TDY as CMR. Upon return, those crewmembers will accomplish a prorated share of
      mission and event requirements (see Table 4.2).
      4.8.1.8. Example: Capt Clarke was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
      attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days.
      His SQ/CC authorized a total of two months proration from his training cycle (73 days
      total. 17 days for emergency leave plus 56 days for SOS).
   4.8.2. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
   impact on a unit's CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
   potential lack of training opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the unit, forcing
   it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time at home station.
   The following proration procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the
   unit's CT program.
      4.8.2.1. Normally, all sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged as
      contingency operations sorties. These sorties do not count toward RAP requirements, but
      may be used for lookback purposes. RAP events logged during contingency operations
      sorties do not count toward RAP requirements, but may be used to update currencies.
      Upon returning from contingency operations, units will prorate RAP missions and events
      for the period of time each individual was deployed. In addition, proration is authorized
      for the deployment spin-up and reconstitution where home station flying is reduced by
      the MAJCOM.
      4.8.2.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary
      considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be
      logged as RAP missions. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event
      requirements, and these sorties and events may not be prorated upon return to home
      station.
      4.8.2.3. Upon return from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating
      the sorties to be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the number of
      valid RAP sorties as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable sortie
      proration. Negative numbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion
      based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sorties.

4.9. Regaining CMR/BMC Status.
   4.9.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons
   certifications or event requirements, recertification/requalification is IAW paragraph 4.6.3
   4.9.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.6, the
   following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember became N-CMR/N-BMC):
      4.9.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The crewmember must complete a SQ/CC approved
      recertification program (documented in the crewmember’s gradebook/training records) to
      return to CMR/BMC status. Upon completion of the recertification program, the
      CMR/BMC crewmember must also meet the subsequent 1-month lookback requirement
      prior to regaining CMR/BMC status. The missions and events accomplished during the
      recertification program may be credited towards the crewmember’s RAP mission and
      event requirements for the training cycle as well as for lookback purposes. In addition, all
      Aircrew Currencies which affect CMR/BMC status must be regained. The SQ/CC will
      approve any other additional training prior to re-certification to CMR.
      4.9.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as paragraph 4.9.2.1, plus open/closed book qualification
      examinations (IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2B-1 Volume 2). Open/closed
      book examinations will be documented on the AF Form 8 as SPOT IAW AFI 11-202
      Volume 2, Chapter 7.
      4.9.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Reaccomplish a SQ/CC directed MQT program to
      include a formal Mission (MSN) evaluation IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2and AFI 11-2B-1
      Volume 2.
4.10. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process.
   4.10.1. Capt Clarke is an experienced CMR crewmember with a 1- and 3-month RAP
   lookback requirement of 3 and 9 RAP sorties respectively. On Feb 3, he flew a RAP sortie
   prior to departing for a non-flying TDY for two months. He returned to the squadron from
   the TDY on 6 Apr. What is Capt Clarke’s readiness status throughout his TDY and upon his
   return?
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                41


  4.10.2. The SQ/CC intended to report Capt Clarke as CMR for readiness reporting purposes
  throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, Capt Clarke’s flight commander (Flt/CC)
  performed the mandatory 1-month lookback on Capt Clarke. Capt Clarke flew only one RAP
  sortie in February, thus failing the 1-month lookback RAP requirements. The Flt/CC then
  performed a 3-month lookback which indicated that Capt Clarke failed to meet his 3-month
  RAP lookback requirement for CMR aircrew because he flew only eight sorties total during
  the months of December, January, and February. Had Capt Clarke flown one more sortie
  during that time span and met his 3-month lookback, his SQ/CC could continue to report
  Capt Clarke as CMR. The SQ/CC had the option to regress Capt Clarke to N-CMR, but
  instead elected to place Capt Clarke on probation based on his past demonstrated abilities and
  continued to report him as CMR.
  4.10.3. On 1 April, Capt Clarke’s 1-month lookback for the month of March was 0 sorties
  requiring the SQ/CC to regress Capt Clarke to N-CMR and place him in a SQ/CC directed
  recertification program. Upon completing this program, Capt Clarke will need to re-establish
  his 1-month lookback by 1 May in order to regain CMR status (if he completes the Sq/CC
  directed program prior to 15 April). NOTE: If Capt Clarke had returned on 22 March and
  had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he would need to fly 3 RAP sorties to recapture his 1-
  month lookback and get off probation. Although Capt Clarke would still be CMR in March,
  the SQ/CC would fly Capt Clarke with an IP on his first sortie in order to regain his landing
  currency.
  4.10.4. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC prorated two months off of Capt Clarke’s
  total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Clarke was deficient in two RAP sorties
  (26 out of 28). The SQ/CC could regress Capt Clark to N-CMR status and place him in a
  SQ/CC directed recertification program, if he deemed the shortfall to be significant. If this
  action was taken and Capt Clarke accomplished the recertification program (the deficient
  missions), the SQ/CC would recertify Capt Clarke as CMR. This training also would count
  for the new training cycle.

    WEAPONS DELIVERY/EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION/CERTIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial qualification and
maintaining continuation training (CT) certification for CMR/BMC WSOs in the employment of
air-to-surface weapons. Refer to ―Description of Events‖ in Attachment 2 for further guidance
on weapons events.
5.2. Initial Qualification. Pilots and WSOs must accomplish initial qualification in guided and
unguided weapons delivery (simulated or actual) requiring qualification at CMR/BMC.
   5.2.1. Initial Qualification Criteria. Initial qualification for guided and unguided weapons
   requires a qualified evaluator monitor crewmember mission planning and in flight weapon
   delivery procedures (actual or simulated) during an AFI 11-202 Volume 2 evaluation. Initial
   qualification is awarded if the planning and delivery requirements specified in the RAP
   Tasking Memo are accomplished and the hit criteria are achieved.
   5.2.2. Qualification achieved during IQT or MQT satisfies the requirements for initial
   qualification, but not for CT certification. Initial qualification and CT certification will carry
   over for crewmember upgrades if previously certified in the weapon type. If unqualified up
   to 39 months initial qualification criteria carries over from previous qualification. If
   unqualified for 39 months, the initial qualification criteria must be re-accomplished. In either
   case CT certification still applies.
5.3. CT Certification. CT certification criteria establishes the minimum standards for
crewmembers to maintain certification in the appropriate weapon delivery events, and does not
determine evaluation criteria established by other instructions, regulations, or agencies. Weapon
delivery events requiring PROF/FAM are specified in the RAP Tasking Memo.
   5.3.1. CT Certification Criteria. CT certification criteria for Pilots and WSOs are achieved
   by maintaining a 75% hit rate for guided weapons and a 50% hit rate for unguided weapons,
   assessed during normal reporting periods of the RAP training cycle. PROF/FAM status
   carries over to the next training cycle. Failure to certify in one event does not invalidate
   certification in the other. Overall hit percentages for guided and unguided weapon
   certifications are calculated by dividing number of hits by number of attempts.
Guided Hit % = Guided Weapon Hits (WE70) / Guided Weapon Attempts (WE69)
Unguided Hit % = Unguided Weapon Hits (FH27) / Unguided Weapon Attempts (FO27)
   5.3.2. Mission Lead Responsibilities. Mission Leads will use all available means to
   accurately assess weapon delivery effectiveness of the pilot flying (PF) and OSO for each
   bomb run during the mission debrief. Navigation Weapons Scoring (NWS) data for
   simulated releases and/or range scoring for actual releases will be the primary methods for
   determining hit criteria. The intent is to ensure an adequate debrief is accomplished that
   quantifies and records weapon delivery effectiveness, while ensuring crewmembers remain
   certified to employ ordnance.
 44                                                      AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


       5.3.2.1. Weapon Hit. A hit will be assessed for each bomb run where the PF and OSO
       deliver actual or simulated weapon(s) against the correct target, within the established
       released criteria.
       5.3.2.2. Weapon Miss Assessment. A miss will be assessed for each bomb run where
       the PF and OSO have an aircrew error that precludes an effective simulated or actual
       weapon(s) release (failure to open weapon bay doors, delivery outside briefed release
       criteria, wrong target coordinates entered into offensive avionics system (OAS),
       premature safeing of stores management system (SMS), etc.).
   5.3.3. CT Weapon Deliveries. CT weapons deliveries will be deliveries simulating realistic
   employment of Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML) munitions considering such factors
   as fuzing, safe escape/separation, frag deconfliction, egress, etc. Actual CT air-to-surface
   weapons event requirements should be accomplished on scoreable tactical ranges as much as
   possible. To maintain a combat perspective in a peacetime environment, weapons deliveries
   should simulate realistic employment of actual munitions. To take credit for a record
   delivery, WSO must be occupying the OSO position in the aircraft.
   5.3.4. Failure to Certify. Failure to certify in one event does not invalidate certification in
   others. SQ/CCs may declare a crewmember uncertified in an event(s) and invalidate all
   previous record deliveries for that event at any time during a training cycle without affecting
   other weapons event certifications. The crewmember will revert to N-CMR/N-BMC and will
   remain in that status until achieving initial certification in the deficient event(s).
   Crewmembers failing to meet required guided and/or unguided weapons hit percentages will
   become uncertified in that event(s) until completion of a squadron directed recertification
   program is completed.
   5.3.5. Certification Cycle. Weapon certification will be aligned with the squadron’s 12-
   month training cycle. At the end of the training cycle, crewmembers’ weapons delivery
   scores will be reviewed to assess their certification. If certified, the crewmember’s
   certification is valid through the following training cycle.
5.4. Weapons Delivery Parameters. The following event descriptions form the basic
framework for aircrew weapons delivery training and all deliveries will conform to the criteria
established for each specific event.
   5.4.1. System Delivery (SD). A delivery of a weapon using the OAS with inputs to the INS
   from the radar and/or GPS. This type of delivery applies to non-guided weapons.
       5.4.1.1. Low Altitude System Delivery (LASD). Minimum run-in altitude is safe
       separation/escape/fuse arm for ordnance being delivered/simulated, aircrew minimum
       low altitude certification, or range/target area restrictions, whichever is higher. Maximum
       altitude is 5,000 feet AGL. Hit criteria: Low Altitude High Drag (LAHD) - 250 feet
       (76m), Low Altitude Low Drag (LALD) - 325 feet (99m) (Use LALD hit criteria to
       evaluate CBU hits delivered below 5,000 feet AGL).
       5.4.1.2. Medium/High Altitude System Delivery (MASD/HASD). For the purposes of
       accomplishing this event, minimum altitude is above 5,000 feet AGL. Hit Criteria: from
       5,000 feet AGL up to but not including 25,000 feet MSL - 475 feet (145m). At or above
       25,000 feet MSL - 575 feet (175m).
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 45


   5.4.2. Degraded Delivery (DD). A delivery of a weapon by the best means available
   without position updates to the host aircraft from the GPS. This type of delivery applies to
   guided weapons. Hit criteria: 226 feet (69m).
   5.4.3. Guided Delivery (GD). A delivery of a weapon autonomously guided by an onboard
   GPS and/ or INS. Delivery of ordnance, actual or training, is not required.
      5.4.3.1. JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition). Actual or simulated release of one or
      more GBU-31s, GBU-38s or GBU-54s. Individuals must plan and execute delivery
      against a single target or a target set to ensure weapon(s) will achieve mission objectives
      and weapon parameters. Hit Criteria: For actual delivery - 49 feet (15m) for GPS aided
      and 98 feet (30m) for INS only (Where the GPS is updating the aircraft but not the
      weapon itself). For simulated delivery - effective release of one or more JDAMs within
      LAR/LP parameters.
      5.4.3.2. WCMD (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser). Actual or simulated release of
      one or more CBU-103, -104 or -105. Individuals must plan and execute delivery against a
      single target or a target set to ensure weapon(s) will achieve mission objectives and
      weapon parameters. Hit Criteria: For actual delivery - 100 feet (30m). For simulated
      delivery – effective release of one or more WCMDs within LAR/LP parameters.
   5.4.4. Standoff Delivery (SD). A delivery of a weapon autonomously guided by an onboard
   GPS and/ or INS. Delivery of ordnance, actual or training, is not required.
      5.4.4.1. JASSM (Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile). Actual or simulated release of
      one or more AGM-158. Individuals must plan and execute delivery against a single target
      or a target set to ensure weapon(s) will achieve mission objectives and weapon
      parameters. Hit Criteria: Effective release of one or more weapon within correct
      parameters.
5.5. Actual Ordnance. Actual ordnance training is essential to aircrew combat capability.
Every attempt should be made to give each crewmember the opportunity to deliver as many
types of weapons inventoried on the UCML as possible. To provide this opportunity, actual
ordnance requirements are listed in the semiannual RAP Tasking Memo and AFI 11-212,
Munitions Requirements for Aircrew Training.

                                           Chapter 6

                                 SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. General. This chapter outlines aircrew upgrade training programs for special capabilities,
certifications, and qualifications. Units will develop and maintain local specialized training
programs based on these guidelines. SQ/CCs may tailor programs for individual crewmembers
based on previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance.
   6.1.1. Ground Training Requirements. Ground training events accomplished in one training
   program, and subsequently required for another training program, need not be re-
   accomplished unless required by the SQ/CC. Units will annotate initial event
   accomplishment in the crewmember’s training record.
6.2. Visual Formation Certification.
   6.2.1. General. The Visual Formation training program is designed to certify aircrew in B-1
   formations other than Trail or Stream. Wingman will be certified in Trail and Stream
   formation upon completion of the requisite TX-1 or TX-2 training. Those certified in visual
   formation positions at the FTU require no additional formal training in those positions at the
   gaining unit. Visual formation certification consists of training in the Route/Observation,
   Fluid, Wedge, and Line Abreast (LAB) positions. The visual formation checkout program
   consists of two separate phases: high altitude visual formation and low altitude visual
   formation. Units will track certification for each phase separately on the squadron’s Letter of
   Certification. High altitude and low altitude visual formation training may be accomplished
   on the same sortie. All crewmembers require visual formation academic training before
   flying any visual formation positions. WSOs do not require flight training. Document all
   ground and flight training activity in the crewmember’s training folder.
   6.2.2. An instructor pilot will conduct all training. At no time will an uncertified pilot fly in
   positions or perform maneuvers not signed off in their training record as proficient without
   supervision. Training is complete following SQ/CC’s review of training records and written
   certification.
   6.2.3. Ground Training. Academic training for each phase will include, but is not limited to:
       6.2.3.1. Review of applicable B-1 formation guidance and restrictions.
       6.2.3.2. Study formation relevant tactics, techniques, and procedures contained in
       AFTTP 3-1.B-1, Tactical Employment-- B-1 with emphasis placed on:
          6.2.3.2.1. Formation definitions, procedures and references.
          6.2.3.2.2. Maneuvering techniques.
          6.2.3.2.3. Defensive Maneuvering.
          6.2.3.2.4. Mission Flow.
          6.2.3.2.5. Formation hazards and formation mishaps.
   6.2.4. Flight Training. Pilots will complete all flight training for each phase within 90 days
   of that phase’s academic training. If a pilot exceeds the 90 day limit, academic training for
   the phase will be reaccomplished.
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                47


      6.2.4.1. High Altitude Visual Formation Phase. Pilots will be certified in High Altitude

          6.2.4.1.11. Rejoin to Tanker Observation position from Echelon.
          6.2.4.1.12. Maintaining Tanker Observation position while the tanker executes turns
          into and away from the aircraft.
      6.2.4.2. Low Altitude Visual Formation Phase. Pilots will practice all formation
      maneuvers at least once above 5,000’ AGL prior to attempting the maneuvers low
      altitude. Initial letdown and maneuvering will be to 1,000’ AGL. At the IP’s discretion,
      aircrew may perform training as low as 500’ AGL. Prior to SQ/CC Low Altitude Visual
      Formation certification, pilots will be proficient in:
          6.2.4.2.1. Dive to low altitude.
          6.2.4.2.2. Turning rejoin to Wedge as wing.
          6.2.4.2.3. Wedge Maneuvering, including hook turns, 90 degree turns into and away
          from the wingman, and shackle.
          6.2.4.2.4. Wedge maneuvering in mountainous terrain.
          6.2.4.2.5. Defensive Maneuvering (Notch/Break, Pump, and Gun Jinks) as the Lead
          and Wingman.
          6.2.4.2.6. Split as wing.
          6.2.4.2.7. Pop to Level.
6.3. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Certification. Pilot NVG training will be conducted IAW
AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
   6.3.1. Program Entry. Pilots are cleared for NVG training once a flight surgeon reviews the
   pilot’s medical records IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and AFI 48-123,
   Medical Examinations and Standards. All training accomplished to proficiency at the FTU
 48                                                       AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


   applies towards the requirements listed below. Document all training activity in the pilot’s
   training folder.
   6.3.2. Ground Training. All initial NVG ground training will be IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1,
   Aircrew Training, conducted by AFRL/AETC/AATTC/MAJCOM FTU certified instructors
   or WIC graduates. Instructors will use AF-approved courseware for initial aircrew ground
   training.
   6.3.3. Flight Training. Accomplish all ground training before entering the flight phase.
   Training will consist of a minimum of two sorties flown with NVGs and at least two NVG
   low altitude navigation events, each with an NVG certified instructor. Flight profiles will
   include at least one sortie with mountainous low altitude navigation and one formation sortie
   as a wingman. In addition to events required by AFI 11-202 Volume 1, initial flight training
   will include:
       6.3.3.1. High altitude formation consisting of NVG aided station keeping, engine near-
       Infrared (IR) signature demonstration, IR strobe light demonstration, and NVG-aided
       rendezvous with a wingman.
       6.3.3.2. Low altitude terrain following consisting of: NVG aided auto TF letdown, fly up
       procedures (accomplished to proficiency) with NVGs, weather effects (when present),
       terrain albedo considerations, and shadow effects.
   6.3.4. All pilots must complete the unit NVG training program and be certified by the
   SQ/CC prior to NVG flights without an instructor.
   6.3.5. Refresher Training. Once NVG qualified, crewmembers will receive annual NVG
   academic refresher training. Topics will include recent hot topics, NVG mishaps, B-1 tactical
   issues, and any other relevant NVG discussion items.
6.4. Targeting Pod (TGP) Training. This program is focused on utilizing and integrating the
targeting pod as an advanced sensor to augment B-1 capabilities to find, fix, track, target, engage
and assess fixed and mobile targets in a dynamic or static environment. WSOs are the primary
operators of the TGP and will be certified to employ all TGP modes/functions to enhance

proficiency. Emphasis will be placed on training needed for missions not accomplished in daily
operations. This training will be conducted IAW all applicable regulations.
   6.18.1. Ground Training. Units will brief Rules of Engagement (ROE)/Training Rules,
   command and control, engagement authority and procedures, Special Instructions (SPINs),
   airspace restrictions, unique communications requirements, Emissions Control (EMCON)
   procedures, and theater Order of Battle. Accomplish a review of the Foreign Clearance Guide
   for the unique procedures and requirements of the destination country. Brief the Customs,
   Courtesies and Cultural differences if applicable. Additionally, this exercise will include a
   discussion of the airfield description and operating peculiarities. This review of the location’s
   unique operational environmental features should include but is not limited to in flight
   procedures, seasonal weather, other unique weather phenomena, wind shear potential and

  characteristics (i.e., sea breeze front, low altitude jet stream potential, etc.), airfield
  restrictions, taxi routes, and operating data if available.
  6.18.2. Flight Training. Spin-up training will be tailored to ensure all deploying
  crewmembers are proficient, current, and qualified in all expected mission taskings.

                                GLOBAL POWER TRAINING

A4.1. General. Global Power is the unclassified term for ACC-tasked bomber out-of CONUS
long-range conventional strike employment-deployment capabilities needed to respond to the
spectrum of Air Expeditionary Force engagement scenarios. Global Power by itself is
unclassified, although any exercises it may be associated with may be classified. The goal of
Global Power sorties is to increase unit combat capability by providing robust and realistic
training opportunities in the global arena, involving multiple Areas of Responsibility (AOR).
Global Power missions are not intended to be an aircrew training requirement only, but rather a
requirement for the entire unit, allowing each part of the war fighting team an opportunity to gain
valuable experience. The benefit of these missions is to provide units with practice in joint
operations, foreign country coordination, nonstandard mission planning and range activities,
international flight planning, physiological aspects of long duration flights, aircraft phase flow
and weapons load training. There is also the potential for these sorties to have much broader
shaping or deterrent effects by demonstrating to our allies and adversaries, long-range aviation
operations, activities, and capabilities. Office of Primary Responsibility is ACC/A3OO, DSN
574-7730.
A4.2. Command Relationships. The execution order (EXORD) for HHD missions will specify
command relations. For most training missions Operational Control (OPCON) will remain with
CDRUSJFCOM. The supported commander has Tactical Control (TACON) for exercises
purposes whenever forces not assigned to that combatant commander undertake exercises in the
combatant commander’s AOR. TACON begins when the forces enter the AOR, and is
terminated at the completion of the exercise after departing the AOR. TACON provides direct
authority over exercising forces for purposes relating to that exercise only; it does not authorize
operational employment of those forces. Specified elements of Administrative Control
(ADCON), to include force protection and concurrent UCMJ authority, are also granted to the
supported commander for deployment/diverts into the AOR.
A4.3. Global Power Mission Requirements.
   A4.3.1. As a minimum, a Global Power sortie must depart the Continental United States
   (CONUS) and/or exit the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), conduct weapons activity
   (actual or simulated on a case by case approval basis), and exercise under the direct control
   of an Air Operations Center (AOC). Although not required, air refueling and entering/exiting
   another AOR meet the intent of improving long-range combat capability and are preferred.
   Sortie profiles should include a robust target set, a credible threat environment and varied
   mission tasks including a realistic Command and Control architecture. Targets, weapons,
   threats, C2 and tasks will be simulated when the sortie lacks actual training opportunities.
   A4.3.2. Each sortie must be a minimum of 13 hours. A goal is for crews to experience the
   physiological effects of long duration flight and practice the required mitigation measures.
   The length of the Global Strike mission will depend upon the actual sortie profile and
   scenario.
A4.4. Funding. For specified Global Power missions ACC/A3O will fund TDY, per diem, and
billeting costs of operation and maintenance personnel supporting the mission. ACC/A3O will
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                               85


approve funding for Global Power missions on a case-by-case basis. Global Power funding is not
authorized for air shows or airlift requests.
A4.5. Scheduling. ACC/A3O will manage the B-1 Global Power program. Global Power
missions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will be included on the ACC
Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS).
A4.6. Public Affairs. Many Global Power missions will attract media attention, and this is
encouraged. All public affairs questions should be routed to the Office of Public Affairs, HQ
ACC/PA, DSN 574-5007.
A4.7. Numbered Air Force Responsibilities.
   A4.7.1. 12AF through 612 AOC should work range requests, fighter intercepts/escort,
   tanker/ALTRV, airlift support, diplomatic clearance, airspace coordination, Electronic
   Attack, etc, through the appropriate organization. 612 AOC will provide the bomber wing all
   information, once coordinated.
   A4.7.2. 12AF through 612 AOC will ensure the correct Air Refueling Support Priority (IAW
   CJCSI 4120.02B) is assigned.
A4.8. Individual Bomber Unit Responsibilities.
   A4.8.1. Units will develop local guidance and procedures for all aspects of Global Power
   missions.
   A4.8.2. Appoint a primary and alternate POC to interface with ACC/A3O on all Global
   Power matters. Ensure ACC/A3O has a current name, message address, DSN number, and e-
   mail address for the POCs.
   A4.8.3. Maintain ACC/A3O and 612 AOC as ―info‖ addressee on all message traffic
   associated with Global Power. Similarly, info the concerned OCONUS MAJCOM and parent
   NAF.
   A4.8.4. Units will consult the ACC CPS to determine the type of exercise the Global Power
   mission will support (i.e. JCS, MAJCOM, etc.) in order to ensure the correct Air Refueling
   Support Priority can be assigned. Contact ACC/A3O if there is any question on the priority
   level to be assigned.
   A4.8.5. Units should coordinate air refueling requests as soon as practical since tanker
   request are normally critical to ensure Global Power mission success. Submit tanker requests
   with the proper priority level annotated IAW CJCSI 4120.02B.
   A4.8.6. Units will consult/comply with the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide and for
   applicable overseas/international guidance.
   A4.8.7. Unit Intel Office will submit a threat advisory support request message IAW ACCI
   14-250 NLT 10 working days prior to launch date. Unit Intel personnel will brief appropriate
   personnel and aircrew of relevant threat information.
   A4.8.8. Units may explore options to use if the mission cannot be accomplished as planned.
   However, alternate missions should be kept as simple as possible due to the complexity of
   the primary mission. Training events will be limited to the minimum required to accomplish
   the specific mission taskings and operational training.
 86                                                        AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011


   A4.8.9. Provide a detailed summary of planned employment activity to ACC/A3O and 612
   AOC NLT 2 weeks before the mission date. Unit POCs will also contact ACC/A3O 48 hours
   prior to mission launch to update the two-week report.
   A4.8.10. In flight reports must be made to the appropriate AOC IAW AFTTP 3-1.B-1,
   Tactic Employment-- B-1. These reports will include, as a minimum, a takeoff report, end air
   refueling report, a strike report, and a landing report. Also, a report will be made anytime
   unplanned circumstances significantly affect the outcome of the mission, such as in flight
   emergency, divert, release system malfunction, weather, or navigation problems. The aircrew
   should request relay of the report to the 612 AOC. 612 AOC will relay the report to ACC
   Command Center as well as the parent wing command post.
   A4.8.11. Within 3 days after the mission, a call must be made to ACC/A3O with a verbal
   report on the mission. This is not an official after-action report but a generalized ―how it
   went‖ briefing. EXCEPTION: if anything occurs during the mission that needs to be briefed
   to the ACC or NAF Staff (diversion, emergency, diplomatic incident, etc.), call the ACC
   Command Post, DSN 574-1555, immediately.
A4.9. Crew Rest and Flight Duty Limitations.
   A4.9.1. Crew Rest. Aircrew and DNIF cover aircrew will be identified no later than 72
   hours prior to launch. The aircrew will be relieved of non-mission related duties 48 hours
   prior to launch. Units will consider using preflight crews to minimize crew duty day. Post-
   flight crew rest should be proportionate to the length of the flight duty period. Longer flight
   duty periods will require longer crew rest periods. For all long duration sorties post-flight rest
   requirement is a minimum of 24 hours, plus one half hour for every time zone crossed in
   flight.
   A4.9.2. Maximum Flight Duty Period. Maximum flight duty period for all sorties is
   defined in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules, Table 9.1. and AFI 11-202 Volume
   3, General Flight Rules, ACC Sup 1. For all sorties exceeding maximum flight duty day
   periods, units must request a duty day waiver from ACC/A3. For HHD missions including
   Global Power missions, the approved Execute Order (EXORD) should contain a statement
   approving the waiver request as well as identifying the maximum duty day for the sortie.
   A4.9.3. Units are encouraged to use any reasonable means to shorten an extended crew duty
   day, such as using preflight crews, minimizing show times. Every attempt should be made to
   minimize conflict with crew circadian rhythms. Where possible, avoid scheduling critical
   phases of flight during normal sleep periods (such as 2300 through 0600 hours home-base
   time).
   A4.9.4. Crew Chief Work and Rest Plan. The aircraft commander, in conjunction with the
   en route station chief of maintenance, will determine how long the crew chief can safely
   perform aircraft recovery actions. The crew chief must have the opportunity for 8 hours sleep
   in each 24-hour period. See AFI 21-101, Maintenance Operations and Management Policy,
   for detailed guidance.
A4.10. Human Factors/Physiological Issues.
   A4.10.1. It is highly recommended that units contact their Wing’s Aerospace and Physiology
   Training team for missions exceeding 24 hours. The Aerospace and Physiology Training
AFI11-2B-1V1 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     87


   team can provide a mission fatigue management timeline. The timeline will provide
   information on sleep/wake cycles and light (night/day) levels expected for route of flight.
   Requirements for the timeline are latitudes and longitudes of route of flight, T/O and land
   times, AR times, and low altitude times.
   A4.10.2. Unit flight surgeons will ensure medications (Go and No-Go Pills) are used IAW
   current AF/A3 and ACC/SG guidelines.
   A4.10.3. Unit flight surgeons will also ensure aircrews receive briefings on human
   performance and physiological issues related to long duration missions.
   A4.10.4. The wing life support officer will develop a long duration flight equipment package
   (i.e. noise reduction headsets, piddle packs, mattress, sleeping bag, etc.) as appropriate for the
   sortie. Use of long duration flight equipment, to include quick-don oxygen masks, is
   restricted to periods of high altitude cruise flight. Crewmembers will comply with ejection
   seat requirements for high altitude cruise removal of torso harness and leg and arm restraints
   in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
   A4.10.5. Unit planners will contact unit flight surgeons upon initiation of planning. Factors
   to be considered include pre- and post-flight crew rest, use of medication, required human
   factors briefings and scheduling of in-flight activities. The unit flight surgeon will act as
   liaison with Air Force Research Laboratory and request on scene assistance as needed. The
   mission fatigue timeline and other related aircrew fatigue management documents may
   function as source documents for guidance.
A4.11. Theater Instructions. Barring additional guidance (EXORD, SPINs, etc.) the following
entry/exit procedures will be used by bomber aircraft operating in the specified AOR and should
help minimize in-flight communications. These procedures do not replace any required exercise-
specific reporting instructions or absolve planners and crew from confirming entry/exit
procedures with applicable AORs, the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, applicable DoD Flight
Information Publication Area Planning guidance, or the applicable Flight Information Handbook.
The delegated authority for requesting an aircraft diplomatic clearance should determine
diplomatic clearance requirements by reviewing DoD foreign clearance guide entries for each
country’s airspace entered along the route of flight. Aircraft and aircrew clearance requests shall
contain the information specified in the DoD Clearance Guide and applicable DoD Flight
Information Publications Area Planning guidance for individual country entries. Initial
coordination of EXORD creation should begin1 month out from planned mission execution.
   A4.11.1. EUCOM. The following procedure will be used by aircrew employing to or
   transiting the EUCOM AOR. Crossing 45W longitude eastbound, aircrew will contact the
   603 AOC directly or via phone patch (DSN 314-478-8831/5014), call sign WOLFHOUND,
   at Ramstein AB, GE. Pass in-flight report to include, time of crossing, aircraft status, and
   ETA to target. The 603 AOC will provide a weather update and confirm range availability if
   within the EUCOM AOR. This does not replace the need to communicate directly with the
   specific range for final confirmation and for the aircrew to comply with all range procedures.
   Keep the 603 AOC advised of any deviations to the original planned operation (use of an
   alternate range, weather divert, etc.). Contact the 603 AOC when exiting the AOR with an in-
   flight MISREP. If exiting eastbound/ entering westbound, make exit/entry report at 30E
   longitude to the 603 AOC. Units will coordinate with the 603 AOC NLT 7 business days
   prior to mission launch to confirm and coordinate the mission SPINS.

  A4.11.2. PACOM. Upon entering the PACOM AOR, aircrew will contact the 613 AOC
  directly or via phone patch through (DSN 315-448-3041) call sign MAUKA, at Hickam
  AFB, HI. Pass in-flight report to include, time of crossing, aircraft status, and ETA to target.
  The 613 AOC will provide a weather update and confirm range availability if within the
  PACOM AOR. This does not replace the need to communicate directly with the specific
  range for final confirmation and for the aircrew to comply with all range procedures. Keep
  the 613 AOC advised of any deviations to the original planned operation (use of an alternate
  range, weather divert, etc.). Contact the 613 AOC when exiting the AOR with an in-flight
  MISREP. Units will call the 613 AOC Chief of Combat Operations (COD) (DSN 315-448-
  3040) on mission planning day to confirm the impending mission and any additional
  information.
  A4.11.3. CENTCOM. Two weeks prior to the mission, the unit POC will contact the
  CENTCOM POC (CCJ3-P (Non JCS Exercise) DSN 968-6340 or CCJ3-E (JCS Exercise)
  DSN 968-6298) to detail command and control authority and specific communication
  requirements (call sign of controlling agency, SATCOM frequencies, DSN #, and number of
  reports required). Contact the CAOC SODO (DSN 318 436-4293) via HF radio (or other
  suitable means) upon entry and exit of the CENTCOM AOR and continuously monitor
  directed frequencies throughout the mission. Aircrews will ensure they report aircraft status,
  location, and any other pertinent information. The controlling agency will pass along
  information as required that may apply to the mission (weather, range status, etc.). Contact
  CENTCOM/CCJ3, DSN 968-6340/6298 (FAX: 968-5829) on mission planning day to
  confirm the impending mission and coordinate details.
  A4.11.4. SOUTHCOM. NLT 30 days prior to the mission, the unit POC will contact the
  AFSOUTH A3X (DSN 228--1770/0209) to conduct initial coordination. Simultaneously, the
  aircrew will also contact the 612 AOC MAAP Cell (DSN 228-8798/8790) to coordinate
  inclusion in the AFSOUTH ATO and any other AOC issues. During mission planning day
  the aircrew should contact the 612 AOC Duty Officer (DSN 228-1982/5189) to get further
  updates/restrictions, coordinate details and to confirm the mission. Upon entering the
  SOUTHCOM AOR, aircrew will contact the 612 AOC directly or via phone patch through
  (DSN 228-1982), call sign RAIDER, at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. Pass in-flight report to
  include, time of crossing, aircraft status, and ETA to target. The 612 AOC will provide a
  weather update and confirm range availability if within the SOUTHCOM AOR. This does
  not replace the need to communicate directly with the specific range for final confirmation
  and for the aircrew to comply with all range procedures. Keep the 612 AOC advised of any
  deviations to the original planned operation (use of an alternate range, weather divert, etc.).
  Contact the 612 AOC when exiting the AOR with an in-flight MISREP.
  A4.11.5. AFRICOM. Upon entering the AFRICOM AOR, aircrew will contact the 617
  AOC directly or via phone patch through (DSN 314-448-3041) at Stuttgart, GE. Pass in-
  flight report to include, time of crossing, aircraft status, and ETA to target. The 617 AOC
  will provide a weather update and confirm range availability if within the AFRICOM AOR.
