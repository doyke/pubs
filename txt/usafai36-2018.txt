(CPR)-2 organization; and added the USAFA Form 91-1, Basic Cadet Outgoing Clearance,
(paragraph 5.3.1.).
1. Responsibilities:
     1.1. Records Managers:
        1.1.1. For CPR-1. HQ USAFA/A1A manages the CPR-1 for all cadets. For access to
        and release of information from the records, see AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel
        Records System.
        1.1.2. For CPR-2. The Commandant of Cadets (HQ USAFA/CW), as CPR-2 manager,
        establishes administrative controls for CPR-2 records under AFI 36-2608.
     1.2. Records Custodians:
        1.2.1. CPR-1 Custodian (for records of first-class cadets). Cadet Classifications and
        Cadet Accessions (HQ USAFA/A1A), is the records custodian for the CPR-1.
        1.2.2. CPR-1 Custodian (for second, third, and fourth-class records). Cadet Customer
        Service (HQ USAFA/A1A), is the records custodian for the CPR-1. HQ USAFA/A1A
        responds to frequent telephone/walk-in inquiries to verify employment, security
        clearances, etc. Records custodians must follow the Privacy Act of 1974 and not release
        any unauthorized information (see AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program).
        1.2.3. CPR-2 Custodian. Squadron Air Officers Commanding (AOC)/Academy Military
        Trainers (AMT) are the records custodians for CPR-2s on cadets assigned to their
        squadron and are responsible for custodianship as well as maintenance of those records.
     1.3. Records Technicians:
        1.3.1. CPR-1 Records Technician.        Each records technician assigned to HQ
        USAFA/A1A maintains the CPR-1 by filing all documents in the CPR-1 as Attachment 2
        specifies. (NOTE: If a document is not listed in Attachment 2, refer to AFI 36-2608.)
        HQ USAFA/A1A conducts semiannual records audits (using current Cadet
        Wing/Exception Roster) to ensure continuing record accountability.
        1.3.2. CPR-2 Records Technician. Each squadron AOC/AMT acts as CPR-2 records
        technician to manage the records for cadets assigned to the squadron. AOCs/AMTs
        account for and file source documents as Attachment 3 specifies. Squadron AOCs/AMTs
        must document all pertinent information and occurrences on cadets in their respective
        squadron.
2. Preparation of Initial CPR-1s and CPR-2s:
     2.1. HQ USAFA/A1A will:
        2.1.1. Prepare a CPR-1 for each cadet candidate who accepts an appointment to the
        USAF Academy, including prior service personnel (regular and reserve) and USAF
        Academy Preparatory School students.
        2.1.2. Ensure receipt of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders received from the
        losing Military Personnel Section (MPS) on prior regular/reserve airmen and filed in
        CPR-1.
USAFAI36-2018 25 AUGUST 2011                                                                        3


      2.1.3. Ensure awards received from losing units of prior service personnel are forwarded
      to the squadron AOC for presentation of the award. HQ USAFA/A1A also places a copy
      of the award in the individual's CPR-1.
   2.2. Basic Cadet Training (BCT) Executive Officer will:
      2.2.1. Ensure the CPR-2 is properly created before an appointee enters the Academy.
      The primary BCT AOC transfers the CPR-2 to the appropriate academic squadron AOC
      when the cadet completes BCT.
3. Tracking Cadet Records:
   3.1. Filing Locations. The records technician files documents in sections as specified in
   Attachment 3 for CPR-1s and Attachment 2 for CPR-2s.
   3.2. Administrative and Safeguard Procedures. The records custodian establishes
   administrative and physical safeguard procedures for CPR-1s. Personnel using CPR-1s must
   be advised that concealment, removal, mutilation, or destruction of records or documents
   may be a criminal offense under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 2071 and Article 134, Uniform
   Code of Military Justice.
   3.3. Access to Records. Personnel have access to CPR-1s and CPR-2s in official capacity
   only. This includes officials from Staff Judge Advocate (HQ USAFA/JA), Directorate of
   Manpower and Personnel (HQ USAFA/A1), Commandant of Cadets (HQ USAFA/CW),
   AFOSI Detachment 808, 10th Security Forces Squadron (10 SFS), Inspector General
   (HQ USAFA/IG), and the Academy Records Management Section (10 CS/SCXPCR).
   3.4. Signing Out Records. The records technician uses AF Form 614, Charge Out Record,
   to account for records temporarily removed from storage cabinets. When a record is
   removed from HQ USAFA/A1A, the records technician attaches a copy of the cadet's Record
   of Emergency Data for Cadet Personnel to AF Form 614 and suspenses it for 72 hours. If
   the record is not returned after 72 hours, the records technician contacts the individual who
   signed it out to see if it is still needed. The records technician continues this process until the
   record is returned to the file.
4. Management Controls:
   4.1. Storage. The records technician files records alphabetically by class and stores them in
   a locked area or container, except when under the direct control of the individual responsible
   for controlling entry or access to such records.
   4.2. Routine Transfer of CPR-2s for Review Purposes:
      4.2.1. To the Academy Board. The squadron AOC ensures the CPR-2 is first reviewed
      by the Vice Commandant of Cadets (HQ USAFA/CWV) and Commandant of Cadets
      (HQ USAFA/CW).
      4.2.2. To Another Individual. The records technician annotates AF Form 614 to ensure
      continuous accountability.
      4.2.3. To Other Agencies:
 4                                                          USAFAI36-2018 25 AUGUST 2011


            4.2.3.1. When a runner transfers a CPR-2 to another agency, the records technician
            must place the record in a sealed envelope or in the locked distribution bag used by
            HQ USAFA/CWV.
            4.2.3.2. The records technician must not transfer a CPR-2 to any agency through
            local distribution channels. (EXCEPTION: May transfer a record from group offices
            to USAFA/CW/CV in a locked distribution bag.)
     4.3. Transfer of CPR-2s During Squadron Reassignment:
        4.3.1. Individual Reassignment. Upon receipt of an order reassigning an individual cadet
        to another squadron, the losing AOC hand carries the CPR-2 to the gaining squadron or
        group AOC. If the cadet hand carries the CPR-2, it MUST be in a sealed envelope.
        4.3.2. Mass Class Shuffle. Each squadron AOC receives a copy of the mass
        reassignment order from Cadet Scheduling (HQ USAFA/CWTS), Cadet Support
        Division (HQ USAFA/ CWTM), through the deputy group AOC. The squadron AOC
        uses this order to annotate the new squadron on each cadet's CPR-2 name label. The
        group AOC receives and disburses the records to the new squadron AOCs. Each
        squadron AOC audits the records using a new squadron alpha roster.
        4.3.3. Verification Procedures for the CPR-2. Each group AOC establishes annual
        review procedures for CPR-2s maintained by the individual squadron AOCs. During the
        review, AOCs verify accountability for each CPR-2, timely filing, and use of AF Form
        614 if a CPR-2 is not available in the storage area.
        4.3.4. Proper Destruction of Records Containing Privacy Act Material. At the end of the
        appropriate retention period after graduation (90 days), the records custodian must
        obliterate material to destroy the record content (tearing into small pieces, shredding, or
        burning) (see AFI 33-332).
5. Separation Processing Procedures (Disenrollees and Turnbacks):
     5.1. AOC Counseling Records. The squadron AOC delivers the CPR-2 to the appropriate
     group secretary when separation correspondence is initiated (voluntary or involuntary). The
     group secretary initiates USAFA Form 34, Cadet Separation Clearance/Referral.
     5.2. CPR-2 Documents. The squadron AOC forwards to HQ USAFA/A1A, by hand
     carrying any CPR-2 documents received after the record has been transferred.
     5.3. HQ USAFA/A1A:
        5.3.1. Includes the USAFA Form 91, Cadet Outgoing Clearance, or the USAFA Form
        91-1, Basic Cadet Outgoing Clearance, in the disenrollment folder. The USAFA Form
        91-1 will be used during Basic Cadet Training (July-Aug) timeframe for basic cadets
        only. After separation is completed, the CPR-1 and CPR-2 are combined into one CPR.
        See Attachment 4 for transfer of documents.
        5.3.2. Upon approval of disenrollment by the Secretary of the Air Force, disposes of all
        documents contained in the CPR as specified in AFI 36-2608 or AFI 33-
        364_USAFASUP, Records Disposition - Procedures and Responsibilities. If a
        disenrollment is stopped or canceled, reestablishes the record as a CPR-1 and CPR-2.
USAFAI36-2018 25 AUGUST 2011                                                                    5


6. Graduation Processing of CPR-1. All graduating/commissioning cadets must complete and
have processed all required documents before graduation. When this is complete, USAFA/A1A
will forward the entire file, minus the Record of Emergency Data for Cadet Personnel, which is
kept for 120 days after graduation, to HQ AFPC/DPMD001for inclusion in Automated Records
Management System (ARMS). Cadets that are projected for graduation with no commission will
complete all out-processing paper work. Once all actions are complete, records will be
forwarded to Dean of the Faculty Student Academic Affairs and Academy Registrar
(USAFA/DFR) for archive.
7. In-processing Turnbacks and Ex-Cadets:
   7.1. Time Frame. Each June and January cadets that are in an administrative turnback
   status and ex-cadets are required to in-process. Cadets must report to HQ USAFA/A1A
   between the hours of 0700 to 1100 hours to receive instructions for in-processing.
   7.2. In-processing Turnbacks
       7.2.1. Administrative Turnbacks. The 10 MDG/SGP provides HQ USAFA/A1A with
       guidance whether or not a cadet in administrative turnback status is returning to the wing.
       HQ USAFA/A1A sends a questionnaire, by registered mail, to the cadet inquiring
       whether or not the cadet desires to come back to the wing. When the cadet does not
       desire to return to the wing, HQ USAFA/A1A informs HQ USAFA/JA of the decision.
       HQ USAFA/A1A also obtains a new P.O. Box number and squadron for the cadet. On
       the appointed day of in-processing, the cadet receives from HQ USAFA/A1A, a copy of
       USAFA Form 92, Cadet In-processing Checklist, and is briefed on each agency listed on
       the checklist and how to in-process back into the wing. An appointment is set up for the
       in-processing cadet with 10 MDG for urinalysis. It is mandatory that the cadet reports
       to the 10 MDG within two hours of notification of the urinalysis requirement. Once the
       in-processing cadet has finished all necessary in-processing, and the checklist has been
       completed, the USAFA Form 92 is brought back to HQ USAFA/A1A and filed in the
       CPR-1.
       7.2.2. Ex-Cadets. See paragraph on in-processing administrative turnbacks for these in-
       processing procedures. Clearance from the 10 MDG is not required for ex-cadets.
       Additionally, ex-cadets must have the Record of Acceptance, Obligation, Reimbursement,
       and Oath of Allegiance readministered and sign an AF Form 2030, USAF Drug and
       Alcohol Abuse Certificate.
