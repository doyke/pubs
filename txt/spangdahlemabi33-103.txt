This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-1, Information Resources
Management, 27 June 2006; TO 00-33A-1001, Methods And Procedures General Communications
Activities Management Procedures And Practice Requirements; TO 00-33D-3003, Methods and
Procedures Managing the Cyberspace Infrastructure with the Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning
System (CIPS); and AFI 33-104, Base-Level Planning and Implementation. The intent of this
instruction is to define the procedures to request and communications requirements. It applies to all
units assigned or attached to Spangdahlem Air Base (AB), Germany. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and its United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE) supplement, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF 847s from the field through the appropriate
functional’s chain of command. For purposes of this instruction and to clarify terminology used in
numerous source documents, Communications and Information system requirements, Command,
Control, Communications, Computer Systems (C4) requirements, and Information Technology (IT)
requirements are all synonymous and are therefore referred to as communications requirements.

1. The 52 FW Communications Requirements Process. The communications and
information systems requirements process enables requesting organizations (customer) to obtain
new communications and information capabilities, with the assistance of the Communications
and Information Systems Officer (CSO). You may also use this process to document
 2                                           SPANGDAHLEMABI33-103 26 JANUARY 2012


communications and information systems sustainment requirements. The process starts when the
customer identifies a mission need and requests CSO assistance with defining the requirement
and developing a technical solution for that need. The customer may also request CSO assistance
with implementing technical solutions. In some instances, the CSO must involve the Base
Systems Telecommunications Engineering Manager (STEM-B), the lead command, frequency
management, communications security (COMSEC) activities, and others to assist in developing
the technical solution. The CSO is the final approval authority for all automated information and
communications systems located on Spangdahlem AB and at all geographically separated units.
2. Background: For the past 2+ years, all units on Spangdahlem have simply contacted 452-
COMM for all communications requirements.
     2.1. Problem: There is no clearly defined documented process for submitting comm
     requirements nor what actually constitutes a requirement. No definition is both confusing
     and frustrating to the customer as well as the CS production work centers.
     2.2. Solution: To provide 52 FW customers a well defined, validated and documented
     process for all requirements and develop and deliver technical solutions at the lowest price
     that meets the needs of the 52 FW.
3. Types of Communications Requirements.
     3.1. Trouble Ticket (TT). A current capability that has stopped working. For example, the
     telephone worked yesterday and today there is no dial tone. Generally, trouble tickets will be
     coordinated with the Communications Focal Point (CFP) or Enterprise Service Desk (ESD).
     3.2. Work Order (WO). An enhancement to a current capability that can be funded and
     accomplished at the base level generally in less than 30 days in the form of a maintenance
     task.
     3.3. Requirement (REQ). The source document that defines the needed communications
     for a new capability to support a mission. The mission impact code and mission impact
     statement define what mission will fail if the requirement is not fulfilled to provide the
     necessary capability. Note: Only WOs, and REQs are addressed in this publication. TTs to
     repair a current capability that has stopped working are reported to the ESD at 478-HELP or
     directly to the CFP (DSN 452-COMM), option 3. A remedy ticket is opened for rectification.
     Remedy is the web-based automated system used throughout the AF to manage Trouble
     Tickets.
4. Priorities.
     4.1. The Priority Matrix (Figure 1 and 2) is strictly followed by the CFP. Priority 1 is the
     highest and priority 9 is the lowest.
     4.2. Mission Critical is defined as a requirement that is critical to meet the 52 FW mission
     and without it would result in imminent mission failure. Mission critical requires the
     organizational CC or equivalent certification in either an uploaded document / attachment to
     the Work Order submission in WOMS or added to the justification field under Work Order
     details. Certification should include an actual impact statement. Not many requirements fit
     into the ―critical‖ category. (NAOC, Accident Board, Presidential visit, etc.)
     4.3. Mission Required is defined as a requirement where the mission itself drives the
     implementation schedule. A good example of this would be a visiting inspection team that
SPANGDAHLEMABI33-103 26 JANUARY 2012                                                       3


   requires PCs, printers, telephones, NIPRnet and SIPRnet access. These types of priorities
   have a firm completion date that the 52 CS must adhere to.
   4.4. Mission Enhancement is defined as all other work orders/requirements where the 52 CS
   drives the implementation schedule. Scheduling is also based on the availability of
   manpower, material, and funding. Examples include office moves, printer/BB requests, etc..

     5.2. Each unit TCO will establish a WOMS account and receive WOMS training from 52
     CS/SCXP.
     5.3. The TCO will submit a WOMS WO to the 52 CS/SCXP. 52 CS/SCXP will determine if
     it stays a WO or converts to a REQ.
6. Requirements Review Board (RRB).
     6.1. RRB goals are to clarify customer IT need, provide cost effective options to meet
     mission requirements, and mange workflow to provide predictable, visible scheduling for 52
     FW customers.
     6.2. The primary purpose of the RRB is to ensure only validated requirements are integrated
     into the 52 CS workflow process to ensure prompt and predictable delivery to the customer.
     The RRB ensures the continued availability of a base-level planning forum to review both
     current and future IT requirements affecting the Spangdahlem AB C4 infrastructure and the
     respective systems supported. The RRB is chaired by the 52 CS/SCX Plans & Resources
     Flight, with membership from 52 CS/SCO Operations Flight & 52 CS/SCX Flight
     Superintendents, STEM-B, and applicable production work center section chiefs. The
     appropriate 52 CS/SCXP project manager is present as a representative for the customer.
7. Technical Solution & Costing (TS&C).
     7.1. TS&C estimates are developed from a validated requirement. Solutions provide the
     detailed information to meet the infrastructure requirement and estimate the cost for
     implementation.
     7.2. Funding for all equipment and material is a financial responsibility of the requesting
     unit. If the 52 CS workload allows, organic 52 CS labor and materials (if available) will be
     used resulting in no cost to the customer. If a TS&C is beyond the scope of the 52 CS, then
     the requesting unit will be responsible for funding the installation through a third party
     installer. (Major Command, Engineering & Installation, contract)
     7.3. See attachment 2 for a list of standardized solutions for the most commonly purchased
     communications devices. See attachment 3 for the typical cost for your typical work order.
8. Requirements Processing Procedures. Individual unit commanders must ensure only valid
C&I requirements are submitted to the 52 CS and the proposals are necessary for mission
accomplishment. See attachments 4 and 5 for work order and requirements process flowcharts.
     8.1. The requesting organization (the customer) submits the requirement to their unit TCO.
     8.2. The unit TCO submits the WO to SCXP via WOMS.
     8.3. The 52 CS/SCXP project manager (PM) contacts the TCO to further define and validate
     the work requested.
     8.4. The PM presents the WO to the RRB.
        8.4.1. The RRB considers the request and if approved, assigns the appropriate priority,
        and returns to the PM for technical solution development.
            8.4.1.1. The PM notifies the TCO that the request was approved and has been
            forwarded for a technical solution.
SPANGDAHLEMABI33-103 26 JANUARY 2012                                                           5


       8.4.2. If the RRB disapproves the request, the PM returns the submission to the unit TCO
       along with justification for its disapproval.
   8.5. The technical solution is provided to the TCO for their approval along with a request for
   funding.
       8.5.1. If funds are available, the PM processes the WO for implementation.
       8.5.2. If funds are not available, the PM transfers the WO to a REQ in CIPS and to an
       unfunded status and notifies the TCO.
   8.6. Project is implemented.
   8.7. 52 CS, Quality Assurance Section (52 CS/SCQ) inspects the project installation as
   required.

                 STANDARDIZED SOLUTIONS FOR IT EQUIPMENT

A2.1. Personal computers and laptops. In accordance with AFI 33-112, Information
Technology Hardware Asset Management, all personal computers and laptops must be ordered
through Air Force Way (AFWAY). The only PC’s or laptop’s allowed to be purchased are those
listed in the AFWAY catalog. The 52CS/SCOS Asset Management section is responsible for
making all purchases through the AFWAY website using the customer’s government purchase
card. The customer submits the WO thru WOMS. Once approved by the RRB, the customer is
notified to provide their GPC account information directly to 52 CS/SCOS. Once the items are
delivered, the customer is notified for pickup.
A2.2. Monitors, printers, scanners, and digital senders. Peripheral devices are unit funded
items and included in the communications requirements process. Once approved by the RRB,
monitors can be procured directly by the customer using a GPC. All requests for printers,
scanners, and digital senders will be governed by SPANGDAHLEMABGM 33-02, Printer
Redux Plan, and can be obtained only with explicit approval from the RRB Chair or 52 CS/CC.
Should you have questions concerning the purchase of peripheral devices, contact 52 CS/SCXP
or 52 CS/SCOM Asset Management for assistance.
A2.3. Blackberry and cellular phones. Requests for cellular services must be approved by the
base CSO prior to purchase. Customers submit their requirement to 52 CS/SCXP through
WOMS along with sufficient justification. The RRB reviews the request and forwards their
recommendation to the CSO for final approval. If approved, the 52 CS Personal Wireless
Communications Systems section will place the order with Deutsche Telekom using the
customer’s GPC. The customer is notified when the device is ready for pickup.
SPANGDAHLEMABI33-103 26 JANUARY 2012                                                         11

                   STANDARDIZED SOLUTIONS FOR IT SERVICES

A3.1. Funding. The purchase of all equipment and material is a financial responsibility of the
requesting unit. If the 52 CS workload allows - depending upon the nature of the WO/New
Requirement – in-house 52 CS labor and materials (if available) will be used. If the work it is
beyond the scope of the 52 CS, then the requesting unit will be responsible for funding the
installation.
A3.2. Local Area Network (LAN) Drop. Estimated €375 per drop. This is the typical cost for
installing one duplex LAN jack, however, there are numerous variables to be considered when
requesting a LAN drop. The final cost depends upon proximity to the building communications
closet, availability of existing conduct, existing port on switch and patch panel, available
workforce, and the urgency of need. Conducting a site survey and developing a technical
solution will show estimated costs for the project. Below is an example of the estimated cost of
materials if needed to be procured and installed by a contractor. See A1.

A3.3. Telephone Install. Where possible, new Voice Over Internet Protocol telephone
instruments are installed by the 52 CS. This is accomplished with no cost to the customer.
However, when there is old or no building infrastructure available, then the cost to install the line
is very similar to that of a LAN drop shown above. Note: Mission priorities dictate utilizing the
52 CS to install network and telephone infrastructure. When available, the 52 CS will utilize in-
house maintenance technicians to perform the work. On occasion, this may not be possible and
our technical solutions may include purchasing the installation services through contracting.
This is a cost bore by the requesting organization.
