Section A—Purpose and Responsibilities
1. Purpose. Many PMELs built or renovated in recent years have not met minimum operating environment
standards. These facilities cannot be certified by the Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program, resulting in
loss of calibration capability at the bases. This manual provides Air Force Civil Engineer standards for design and
construction of Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories. Use it as a guide for site selection and design of a
new metrology laboratory, or for modification of an existing facility. Only those requirements which directly affect
the accuracy and integrity of the measurements made and are unique to a calibration laboratory are addressed.
Criteria in this manual must not be used as sole justification to improve an existing facility if the facility’s condition
does not adversely affect the environmental requirements for performing measurement traceability. Users should
contact AFMETCAL DET 1/ML, 813 Irving-Wick Drive West Suite 4M, Heath OH 43056-6116, and HQ
AFCESA, Tyndall AFB early in the design phase to ensure their facility will meet or surpass the basic design
criteria.

2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. Headquarters Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (HQ AFCESA):
        2.1.1. Establishes standards and criteria for Air Force PMEL design and construction.
        2.1.2. Provides technical assistance to the MAJCOMs and bases.
    2.2. AFMETCAL DET 1/ML: Manages the Air Force Metrology and Calibration program, including the PMEL
    program.
    2.3. Base Civil Engineer:
        2.3.1. Ensures this manual is referenced in all PMEL project design documents, and reviews A&E Design
        Documents to ensure their compliance with this manual.
        2.3.2. Hosts a pre-planning workshop prior to development of programming documentation for new
        construction, major rehabilitation, or major modification of the PMEL environmental system.
        2.3.3. Invites representatives from AFMETCAL DET 1/ML, Base PMEL, the MAJCOM PMEL
        Functional Area Manager (FAM), and the MAJCOM CE functional manager to participate in the
        workshop.

Section B—Facility Design
3. Design Approach. The design approach described in this section simplifies construction or renovation of a
wide variety of PMELs by including the basic calibration and administration area requirements which apply to any
PMEL. It incorporates common area criteria with unique criteria to arrive at an overall space requirement. Figure
1 is an example layout showing relative locations of laboratory and administrative functions. Tables provided in
attachment 2 should be carried over directly to the design documents, and incorporated into the commissioning
process. Architectural features specified in this manual must be included in PMEL design. NOTE: Figure 1 is
not to scale and does not show all facility requirements.

Figure 1. Example PMEL Layout.




4. Space Requirements. There are four basic sizes for the PMEL calibration/repair area, each based on the size
of the inventory supported (Table 1). Some PMELs support more than a 10,000 item inventory. If the PMEL
supports between 10,000 and 20,000 items, add the area for Plan D to the value obtained by multiplying the
number of items over 10,000 by 0.5. The product will be the space requirement in square meters (square feet) for
the calibration/repair area of the PMEL. For PMELs supporting an inventory over 20,000 items, add the space
required to support the 20,000 items (3,141 square meters [10,185 square feet]) to the value obtained by
multiplying the number of items over 20,000 by 0.4. In general, space required for measurement areas depends on
the area needed per work station; space required for support/administrative areas is based on the number of
personnel working in the PMEL. Support/administrative area figures are not included in Table 1.
    4.1. Layout. Locate rooms, spaces, and equipment to ensure orderly workflow, and provide security and
    property management. Incompatible areas should not be in close proximity; e.g., equipment that vibrates
    should not be near the calibration/repair area when vibration may affect measurements. Moisture-generating
    areas such as restrooms and breakrooms should not be near the calibration/repair area. Limit outside walls in
    the calibration/repair area as much as possible. North exposures and east exposures are preferred. Ensure
    traffic from movement of equipment, technicians, and customers is isolated from the calibration/repair area.
    Where possible, design doors and air locks (paragraph 4.1.2) to allow movement of large PMEL equipment and
    appropriate material handling equipment within the facility. With the exception of the air lock doors, designate
    all exit doors as emergency exits only.

         4.1.1. Calibration/Repair Area. Floors, corners, aisles, and work areas must be clear and uncluttered for
         easy, frequent, thorough cleaning. Do not place exterior windows (except for optical windows, as required)
         in the calibration/repair area; however, sealed glass viewing ports may be installed in calibration areas to
         permit viewing without entering. Pass-through windows are not permitted. Minimize the number of doors
         in the calibration/repair area consistent with fire and safety regulations. Locate equipment to prevent
         disrupting airflow and heatflow patterns within the calibration/repair area. This will minimize temperature
         fluctuations in areas most affected, such as dimensional calibrations.
         4.1.2. Air Lock. Use a minimum 1.8-meter (6-foot) wide air lock at the entrance to the calibration/repair
         area, with a door opening at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) wide to accommodate large equipment. The air lock
         must be at least 2.7 meters (9 feet) long to ensure both sets of doors are not open at the same time. Double
         doors are preferred (exception: a sliding door may be used). Do not position air lock doors in-line with
         building entry doors.
         4.1.3. Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Rooms. Mechanical equipment is usually housed separate
         from electrical equipment. It is critical that equipment fits the space without crowding and allows adequate
         space for maintenance. Plan on a minimum of 15 percent of the total structure area. Utility rooms must be
         structurally (seismically) separate from the rest of the PMEL building. Overseas PMELs require
         additional space for 400- and 500-Hz motor generators with sound dampening walls between these
         generators and other areas.
         4.1.4. Cleaning Room. The Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) cleaning room must
         be a separate room from the calibration/repair area, and supplied with utilities.
    4.2. Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing Requirements. Using the internal and site layouts, locate
    interfaces between the facility structure and equipment items. Verify the design contains openings, conduit, and
    raceways to install cables, equipment, and piping with minimum disruption to finished work. During the
    predesign stages of the project, the PMEL Supervisor must provide the Design Agent with technical data for
    any equipment which requires special connections.

5. Acceptance Testing Criteria. To assure construction compliance, criteria for acceptance testing must be
developed from the design and construction specifications, and appropriate test methods selected. Some tests must
be conducted over a specific period of time, such as temperature and humidity variation in the calibration/repair
areas during a seasonal change. Outside consultants may be hired to perform such tests as air balancing, air flow,
and temperature gradients.

Section C—General Facility Requirements
6. Site Evaluation:
    6.1. Vibration. The PMEL facility site must be isolated from sources of vibration such as railroads, heavy
    vehicle or aircraft traffic, cranes or machine operations, foot traffic, or similar disturbances. (An infrequently
    used option is constructing the facility below ground level.) Vibration level in the PMEL calibration/repair
    area must not exceed limits specified in Instrument Society of America (ISA) RP52.1, Recommended
    Environments for Standards Laboratories: 0.25 µm (10 microinches) between 0.1 and 30 Hz; and 0.0098
    m/s2 (0.001 g) between 30 and 200 Hz. Contact AFMETCAL DET 1/MLLE for assistance when excessive
    vibration is suspected at new PMEL sites.
    6.2. External Electromagnetic Interference/Radio Frequency Interference (EMI/RFI). The amount of EMI/RFI
    generated by nearby overhead high voltage lines, radio and TV transmitters, and microwave antennas
    determines the suitability of a site, and the extent of internal facility shielding required. Most building sites not
    close to sources of EMI/RFI will meet the electromagnetic requirements for PMELs, since average magnetic
    field in the vicinity of overhead electrical distribution lines drops off rapidly with distance. With maximum
    currents of up to 243 amperes, average maximum field exposure is approximately 13.53 milligauses at zero
    meters (zero feet) and 2.48 milligauses at 30.5 meters (100 feet). These levels would be acceptable for most
    laboratories. EMI/RFI levels should be reevaluated whenever generators are installed after a PMEL is
    operational. If excessive EMI/RFI is suspected, contact AFMETCAL DET1/MLLE.

7. Building.
    7.1. Functional Requirements. The building must provide:
         7.1.1. Protection from inclement weather or other atmospheric conditions to allow facility environmental
         conditions/ parameters to be maintained at the levels specified in this manual.
         7.1.2. Controlled access, including protection from unauthorized entry, and security for maintaining
         classified equipment and documents.
         7.1.3. Protection from toxicological, radiological, mechanical, electrical, electromagnetic, pyrotechnic,
         visual, and other special hazards.
         7.1.4. Utilities and other services.
    7.2. Construction. The building must be single-story, ground floor, concrete slab construction; exterior doors
    must not face prevailing winds.
    7.3. Calibration/Repair Area Positive Pressure. A minimum positive static pressure of 12 pascals (0.05 inches
    of water) is required in the calibration/repair area to prevent infiltration of dust-laden air. Air should flow from
    the calibration/repair area through the grille of the inside air lock door and into the air lock, then out through
    the spaces around the outside air lock doors (normal construction tolerance), preventing infiltration of dust-
    laden air to the calibration/repair area. Note: The positive pressure requirement does not apply to
    Radioactivity Detection Indication and Computation (RADIAC) or liquid flow calibration areas in separate
    rooms.
    7.4. Shoe Cleaners. Electrical and vacuum connections for shoe cleaners must be available at the entrance to
    the air lock. Provide a grounded touch pad at each shoe cleaner to dissipate electricity. Shoe cleaners are not
    required for Type IV PMELs.
    7.5. Vacuum Cleaning System. A wet/dry vacuum cleaning system is required for cleaning TMDE, shoe
    cleaners, janitorial service of the calibration/repair area and other support areas. Install flush-mounted outlets
    in the walls approximately 0.6 meters (2 feet) above the finished floor. Outlets should be spaced so that hose
    length does not exceed 9.1 meters (30 feet) and each area can be reached by the hose intake fitting. At least
    four outlets should be operated simultaneously when using 38-millimeter (1½-inch) hoses and long sweep
    fittings. Install vacuum piping in the walls. Vacuum pressure at the end of each hose must be no less than
    6221 pascals (25 inches of water). Vent system exhaust outside the building away from air inlets and other
    dust-sensitive areas.
    7.6. Intercom System. An intercommunications system is required to allow two-way conversation between
    rooms in the PMEL facility. Normally, base communications personnel will provide and install the system;
    however, conduit runs and terminal boxes to support the intercom, telephone, and computer systems must be
    part of facility design.
    7.7. Compressed Air. Oil-free, dry, compressed air for technical use in the calibration/repair area must be
    supplied from an oil-free compressor. Compressed air must conform to ANSI/ISA S7.3, Quality Standard for
    Instrument Air, with minimum pressure of 690 kPa (gage) (100 psig). Pressure of compressed air used at
    workbenches should be reduced with a precision valve and a 0-690 kPa gage. Compressed air quality for
    technical use in the calibration/repair area or for operating TMDE must satisfy operating manuals for the
    TMDE to be serviced. In no case will the oil content of compressed air be greater than 24 ppm/wt and -40 ºC
    (-40 °F) atmospheric dew point. This quality may be achieved using dryers fitted with appropriate prefilters or
    coalescent air filters that remove oil and particulates. Provide an in-line oil monitor. Supply a refrigerated
    dryer for high flow requirements. Minimum filter requirement for an equipment cleaning area incoming air line
    is 75 microns. All air lines into the laboratory must have an automatic blow-down valve ahead of each filter.
    Each top connection and line tie must lead off the top of the line. The number of outlets and total capacity may
    vary by individual laboratory; but normally, a minimum 9.4 L/s (20 scfm) is needed. Each PMEL organization
    will determine specific requirements and incorporate them into the design criteria. Install the air compressor in
    the utility room as real property and size it to satisfy total facility requirements. Mark compressed air lines to
    show pressure.
    7.8. Dry Nitrogen. Water-pumped dry nitrogen (oil free) is required for technical use. It must conform to
    Federal Specification BB-N-411, Nitrogen, Technical, Type I, Class 1, Grade B; or MIL-P27401, Propellant
8                                                                             AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998

    Pressurizing Agent, Nitrogen, Type I. Install dry nitrogen cylinders in the utility room. Piping run to the
    calibration/repair area must be rated at 4137 kPa (gage) (600 psig). Mark nitrogen lines to show pressure.
    7.9. Exhaust Ventilation. Exhaust ventilation systems must accommodate the fume hoods over temperature
    calibration baths.
    7.10. Fire Protection. The PMEL facility must have a complete sprinkler system conforming to National Fire
    Protection Association (NFPA) 13, Sprinkler Systems; and a manual fire evacuation system conforming to
    NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Code.
    7.11. Personnel Entrance Canopy. The personnel entrance to the building must be protected with an overhang.
    Where practicable, use a vestibule (two sets of doors), to prevent cold/hot air or dust from infiltrating the
    facility. Entrance doors should be recessed to prevent wind damage.
    7.12. Service Entry. Provide an entrance for unloading equipment: either a double-entry door with a drive-
    through canopy, or a service entry with a roll-up door large enough to allow a small truck or van to back into
    the unloading area. Quantity and size of equipment handled and weather conditions should determine which
    entry is appropriate.
    7.13. Oversized Equipment Entry. Where oversized equipment cannot be moved through the air lock, provide
    a set of tightly-sealed double doors between the precision dimensional area and the building exterior.
    7.14. Communications. During development of the building layout, consult with Base Communications to
    identify space and functional requirements (usually a small, dedicated room with conduit and wiring) for
    telephone, computer, and other communication needs.

Section D—Materials and Methods of Construction
8. Type N Construction.        Use standard construction materials and practices for permanent, Type N (non
combustible) construction.

9. Clean Construction Protocol. Cleanliness within a PMEL facility is necessary to: (1) protect precise
measurement surfaces from abrasive damage caused by dust particles; (2) prevent contamination of fluids,
chemicals, and metals used during the calibration process; and (3) comply with positive pressure requirements in
the calibration/repair areas to duplicate the positive pressure in higher echelon laboratories that calibrate primary
standards. Although cleanliness and particle filtration requirements for most PMELS are not as stringent as for
clean rooms, incorporating clean construction protocol (CCP) in design and construction contracts is recommended.

10. Structural Elements. Use masonry walls, metal studs, steel joists, steel columns, and steel beams. Where
possible, locate specially conditioned areas within the structure so the walls are interior partitions. These interior
walls should be insulated and have as much thermal mass on the controlled (calibration/repair area and precision
dimensional area) side of the wall as possible. For example, if the wall is stud construction, use two layers of 16-
millimeter (5/8-inch) gypsum board on the controlled area side, with batt insulation, vapor barrier, and 13-
millimeter (½-inch) gypsum on the outside. Good workmanship is essential in finishing each joint and seam of the
walls to minimize air filtration and exfiltration. Interior partitions must extend above the vapor barrier of the
ceiling.

11. Minimizing Vibration. To minimize vibration in the calibration/repair area:
    11.1. Use expansion/isolation joints in the concrete floor on the outside toe of the walls defining the
    conditioned area to isolate the thermal mass of the floor and reduce vibration transmission. Use vibration-
    isolating joints in the utility room where walls and floor adjoin the main structure.
    11.2. Locate vibration-generating equipment such as blowers, compressors, heating and air conditioning units,
    vacuum pumps, and transformers on separate, isolated utility pads.
    11.3. Use specialized shock mounts, air bag supports, or isolated massive blocks.
    11.4. Mount air conditioning equipment (condenser/compressor or fan coil units) to the structure using steel
    spring type isolators which limit vibration transmission to 0.0098 m/s2 (0.001 g) or less.
    11.5. Use flexible boots or connectors to reduce vibration transmission through ductwork, piping, and rigid
    tubing.
AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                                        9

     11.6. Do not allow rigid conduit such as feeders, subfeeders, and their supports to contact other objects.
     11.7. Use flexible neoprene-jacketed conduits for connections to vibration producing equipment. Install
     flexible bonding ground straps to ensure continuity of the ground.
NOTE: Workbenches and surface plates mounted on vibration isolators or air bearings should be used in PMELs
where extensive isolation techniques cannot be used. This will reduce vibration transmitted to sensitive
instrumentation in contact with these surfaces. See paragraph 6.1 for more information on vibration control.

12. Vapor Barriers. Vapor barriers usually are placed on the warm side of a wall and ceiling. If the primary
method of environmental control is cooling, or if heating and cooling are used about equally, place the vapor barrier
away from (outside) the conditioned area. This will eliminate any possibility of moisture buildup, and result in
fewer penetrations of the vapor barrier, since most power outlets will be facing into the conditioned area. Where
heating is the primary method of environmental control, place the barrier toward the inside of the wall and the
ceiling. On concrete masonry units, use foil face rigid insulation on the outside of the wall. Fur out and finish the
wall. Install a vapor barrier underneath new floor slabs. Seal all penetrations in walls, ceilings, and floors.

13. Finishes. Prepare surfaces to prevent - or at least reduce - dust accumulation. Clean concrete masonry
thoroughly to remove dirt, fungus, grease, oil, glaze, loose particles, and scale. Fill voids to give a smooth surface
without pits or holes. Repair joints, cracks, holes, and other surface defects in gypsum wallboard so the surface is
flush and smooth. Where there are painted surfaces, use a smooth, nonchalking, mildew-resistant semigloss finish
which will stand up to frequent cleaning. Use light neutral tints, such as light blue or beige, to prevent eye fatigue,
increase light reflectivity, and improve lighting efficiency.

14. Wainscots. Wainscots should be avoided because the top edge accumulates dust. If wainscotting is necessary,
the top edge should be rounded or beveled.

15. Air Lock Doors. Air lock doors must have 610- by 760-millimeter (24- by 30-inch) shatterproof glass vision
panels (or the closest standard size that fits) and bumpers to prevent equipment and cart damage. Door interlocking
systems are not necessary. Doors closest to the calibration/repair area must have gasket-type stops, astragals,
automatic door bottoms, and a properly-sized grille installed above the doors (not required on outside air lock
doors). Joints between doors and frames must be sealed with gaskets.

16. Floor Covering in Calibration/Repair Areas and Air Locks. Use 1.8-meter- (6-foot-) wide non-conductive
sheet vinyl flooring. Each joint must be routed and welded or bonded to form a seamless floor when installed
according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Sheet vinyl is recommended because its smooth, continuous surface
simplifies daily cleanup, including chemical and mercury spills. At junctions of the floor and walls, install a wood
or wax fillet strip, and turn up the sheet vinyl flooring to form a seamless “self-coved” base with the top edge fitted
into a molding strip. Do not wax hard-surfaced flooring since waxed surfaces are highly resistive and prone to
static generation. Wax also flakes and contributes to dirt accumulation. Do not install carpet in air locks because
it interferes with door operation. Floor mounted thresholds are not permitted.

17. Ceilings. Install finished ceilings with clear ceiling height of not less than 2.74 meters (9 feet) throughout the
PMEL (except in the utility and mechanical rooms) to provide a finished surface, conceal conduits, and provide an
adequate thermal mass to stabilize temperatures. Where possible, the ceiling should be finished gypsum board with
insulation. Drop-in ceiling panels cannot assure the same level of reduced vapor transmission and air exfiltration.
NOTE: Preferred ceiling and wall systems will add little to project costs, but will improve the thermal and
humidity performance of the environmental control system.
    17.1. Framing. Ceiling framing systems (if used) must be metal and support the required load without
    excessive deflection or vibration. The distance from floor to framing may dictate suspended or furred ceilings.
    Do not tie suspension systems to catwalks or mechanical and electrical equipment platforms.
    17.2. Ceiling Access Panels. Provide air-tight, dust-tight ceiling access panels for environmental system
    balancing and required maintenance.
10                                                                             AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998

     17.3. Calibration/Repair Area. The ceiling system for the calibration/repair area of the PMEL must provide a
     surface that will reduce air leakage, prevent dust infiltration, and not produce dust. Acceptable ceilings in
     order of preference are:
         17.3.1. A monolithic surface of drywall or plaster construction with finished joints and corners.
         17.3.2. Noncombustible acoustical units (mineral composition) secured to concealed metal runners with
         concealed fastenings and hold-down clips. Acoustical units must not shed particles, and must be installed
         with a joint system that will not leak due to the difference in air pressure above and below the ceiling. Do
         not use fissured or perforated units.
         17.3.3. Lay-in panels, supported in a suspended exposed metal grid system. Securely fasten lay-in panels
         with concealed tape or clips to prevent movement or loss of air pressure and to prevent infiltration of dust.
         Use factory finished hardboard, vinyl faced and edged gypsum board, or acoustical units described above.
         Use lay-in panels only for renovation work where other options are not cost-effective.

Section E—Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) for Calibration/Repair Areas
18. Standards for Facility Environmental Control. For environmental control purposes, each PMEL will have
three areas: an administrative area; a main calibration area (can be broken up into separate rooms for specific
purposes); and either a temperature/humidity sensitive (T/H S) area or a 68 degree room, depending on the purpose
of the PMEL. T/H S rooms contain dimensional and other equipment which require more stringent environmental
control. Design conditions for each area must be maintained on a continuous basis under varying loads, including
periods when the laboratory is not in operation. Excluding the administrative area, reference AFM 88-29,
Engineering Weather Data, for local outside temperature and humidity conditions using a 99 percent criterion for
heating, and a 1 percent temperature and relative humidity criterion for air conditioning.
    18.1. Administration Areas. Design the administrative area to normal comfort conditions using good
    commercial practice and ASHRAE standards for ventilation and air conditioning for administrative areas.
    18.2. Main Calibration Lab. The environmental control system serving the main calibration area must
    maintain a temperature of 23 ± 1.1 ºC (73 ± 2 °F) dry bulb and a relative humidity of 40 percent, +5/–20
    percent.
    18.3. Temperature/Humidity Sensitive Area. The T/H S room environmental control system must maintain a
    temperature of 23 ± 1.1 ºC (73 ± 2 °F) and a relative humidity of 40 percent, +5/–20 percent. Though room
    temperature may vary 2.2 ºC (4 °F), the temperature may not vary more than 0.5 ºC (1 °F) in any one hour
    period during normal system operation. Maximum temperature gradient across the room is 1.1 ºC (2 ºF).
    18.4. 68 Degree Room. Where a 68 degree room is required, the environmental control system shall maintain
    a temperature of 20 ± 0.5 ºC (68 ± 1 °F) dry bulb and a relative humidity of 40 percent, +5/–20 percent.
    Precise dimensional standards demand a 45 percent maximum acceptable relative humidity to preclude
    corrosion problems. The temperature may not change more than 0.5 ºC (1 °F) in any one hour period during
    normal system operation. A modular clean room may be provided to meet these requirements.

19. HVAC Design Considerations. A number of factors must be considered in the design of the environmental
system to satisfy criteria. PMELs are issued restricted certification or decertified when the operating environment
(temperature and humidity) is outside the required operating tolerances. This causes workloads to be transferred to
other laboratories, resulting in costly delays until the condition is corrected. Although specific guidance is
impractical due to the wide range of local conditions encountered at PMEL facilities, the following must be
carefully considered:
    19.1. Psychrometric analysis to determine the effect of local conditions on design. This analysis, including a
    review of past problems with similar facilities, will prevent designing an inadequate environmental system.
    19.2 Equipment heat gain. The using agency must determine the electrical equipment load so that electrical
    apparatus heat gains can be considered in the air conditioning design. During the predesign stages of the
    project, the using agency will provide the agency responsible for design the maximum, minimum, and average
    heat gains for both PMEL-owned and PMEL-supported equipment that is expected to be connected to electrical
    power during a normal day's operation. Also provide the approximate equipment location.
AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                                   11

    19.3 Controls/instruments to record temperature and humidity data. Careful study of AFM 88-29 is essential.
    Design calculations should recognize the effect of brief deviations in outside temperature and humidity beyond
    those listed. Recording instruments, calibrated to National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST)/International Standards, will be contractor-supplied and may be combined with the controller. The
    recording device must be capable of discerning 0.25 ºC (0.5°F).
NOTE: The designer should optimize the selection of cooling equipment taking into account all aspects of
performance, reliability, maintainability, and capital and maintenance costs.

20. Facility HVAC Design Features:
    20.1. Building Layout (Figure 1). Whenever practical, locate the calibration/repair area adjacent to other
    conditioned areas. Lab space should always be covered with an attic or plenum loft space to reduce the effect
    of solar loads on the control requirements. When impractical to provide adjacent conditioned space, consider
    increasing the thermal mass of the envelope. Follow American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air
    Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) fundamentals to determine the U values for building construction elements.
    20.2. Chilled Water Systems. A chilled water system with reheat is usually the best option to maintain
    required temperature tolerances. A central building chilled water system with modulating control is most
    satisfactory for the required 4.4 ºC to 5.5 ºC (40 °F to 42 °F) water. Select compressors to be the most
    efficient over the range of anticipated loads. In humid regions, reciprocating compressors must have the
    maximum number of capacity steps to obtain adequate humidity control. Hot water reheat is recommended.
    20.3. Single Zone Air Handling Units. Use single zone air handling units to isolate control requirements for
    each major PMEL area. Size calibration/repair area cooling coils to maintain nominal 40 percent relative
    humidity under the location design conditions listed in AFM 88-29. Determine the minimum acceptable room
    air change rate from ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, Ventilation for Acceptable Air Quality. The design
    requirement is to provide even temperature throughout the controlled space.
    20.4. Air Distribution. Design the air distribution system to circulate air throughout the facility to prevent
    stratification. Use non-unidirectional air pattern control. Specifications apply within the space 0.9 meters to
    1.5 meters (3 feet to 5 feet) above the floor (working area); air velocity in the working area must be 7.6 ± 3
    meters (25 ± 10 feet) per minute. Keep noise level below 45 dB as measured by a meter meeting American
    National Standards Institute (ANSI) S1.4, Sound Level Meters, Specification for. Locate heat-generating
    equipment (such as temperature baths) to prevent heat buildup; also isolate high-heat-generating equipment to
    maintain temperature within required limits. Localized exhaust may be used for this purpose, provided make-
    up air requirements do not adversely affect system operation.
    20.5. System Response. The system must heat, cool, humidify, and dehumidify as required at all anticipated
    flow rates. Design and construction documents must specify: the maximum difference in temperature and
    humidity between supply air and room air (to establish the rate of change of the room environment); and the
    number, type, and location of room thermostats and humidistats and how the environmental system responds to
    their signals. Duct design should not rely on adjusting dampers on diffusers or grills for control because of the
    effect on air distribution patterns. Where required, provide dampers inside ducts and install access panels.
    20.6. Condensate Discharge. Discharge condensate from cooling coils into a floor drain.
    20.7. Recording Devices. The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program requires permanent records of
    temperature and humidity data in calibration areas. The data must be provided by a contractor-supplied
    continuous recording system which uses self-contained sensor/recorders, or remote sensors with centrally-
    located recorders. Temperature and humidity sensors are required in each separate room in the calibration
    area, and a minimum of one set of sensors for every 186 square meters (2000 square feet) of calibration area.
    When selecting recording devices, consider accuracy and response time -- critical environments require
    immediate response and high accuracy. Mount sensors at bench level, as near as possible to the most critical
    area of measurement. If practicable, flush-mount recording devices with remote sensors within the walls.
    Calibrate recording instruments to NIST/International Standards. Recording device temperature resolution
    must be 0.1 degrees (Fahrenheit and Celsius) or better, and humidity sensor percent relative humidity resolution
    must be 0.5 percent relative humidity or better. An alarm will be relayed to the PMEL Computer System and
    the Base Energy Management and Control System (EMCS) when the calibration area environment is out of
12                                                                            AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998

     tolerance or the HVAC system operating parameters are out of tolerance. Both the recording device and the
     alarm system will indicate real time. All temperature and humidity sensors, including wall-mounted assemblies,
     will be removable for calibration, and indicating devices will be capable of accepting new calibration data.

21. Calibration Area Environmental Control:
    21.1. Makeup/Outside Ventilation Air. Use a separate system to supply a constant volume of preconditioned
    makeup/outside ventilation air to the HVAC systems serving the non-administrative areas of the PMEL. The
    system must be equipped with heating and cooling (chilled water/glycol) coils and controls to temper outside air
    to a neutral (22.8 ± 1.1 ºC [73 ± 2 °F]) dry bulb temperature, and regulate humidity levels. In some climates,
    an air-to-air heat exchanger may be beneficial to precondition makeup air. Humidity in nonadministrative areas
    will be controlled by regulating the humidity in the outside/makeup air system. Coils must meet 99% design
    conditions. Discharge air from this system must be mixed with the return air from the calibration area. To
    facilitate inspection and cleaning, install access doors between coils, and ensure coils are no more than eight
    rows deep. In humid areas, the amount of dry outside air required to dehumidify the calibration area may
    exceed the amount required for ventilation and makeup. In these cases, a portion of the return air can be drawn
    through this system and dehumidified with the outside air stream. Also consider using desiccants for the
    outside/makeup air in areas of high humidity.
    21.2. Room Pressurization/Filtration. Use a self-reading magnahelic gauge to measure pressure differential
    between the calibration/repair area and surrounding spaces. Except for the 68 degree room, air filters will have
    80-85% efficiency when tested by an acceptable atmospheric dust spot test (reference ASHRAE Standard 52.1-
    1992, Gravimetric and Dust-Spot Procedures for Testing Air-Cleaning Devices Used in General Ventilation
    for Removing Particulate Matter). Install roughing filters in the administrative area. The 68 degree room
    must have a filtration system which satisfies a particle count not exceeding 24,700 particles per cubic meter
    (700 particles per cubic foot) of atmosphere, 5 microns and larger; and 3,530,000 particles per cubic meter
    (100,000 particles per cubic foot) of atmosphere, 0.5 microns and larger. Accurately detail filter installation to
    ensure easy access and quick changing of filters, minimizing air system shutdown. Install diaphragm-activated
    draft gages with remote audible alarms across all filter banks to signal when filter replacement is required.

Section F—Electrical Power
22. Power Distribution. Safe and permanent sources of power must be available to calibration personnel, integral
to or near each workstation, to supply power to the standards, comparators, and workload items assigned to the
area.
    22.1. Types of Electrical Power. Normally, electric service will be provided at 480 Vac, 3-phase, 60 Hz.
    Listed below are possible PMEL power requirements for testing. This list does not include lighting and air
    conditioning requirements. Power demand varies depending on the workload of the individual PMEL. The
    PMEL superintendent will assist the Base Civil Engineer in determining power requirements and equipment
    heat loads, and identifying any special mission requirements.

                 Nominal System Voltage*           Phase                 Frequency
                          277/480                  1&3                   60 Hz ± 1 Hz
                          120/240                  1&3                   60 Hz ± 1 Hz

         *CONUS installations
     22.2. Voltage Regulation. Voltage drop of the building wiring system will not exceed 3 percent to any outlet.
     Provide outlets for technical testing with regulating equipment to maintain voltage within ±2 percent of the
     basic voltage, except 28 Vdc which will be regulated to ±3 percent. Time constant (response time) of the
AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                                     13

    voltage regulators should not exceed 0.3 seconds, and total harmonic distortion must not exceed 5 percent.
    Power conditioning and continuation interface equipment (PCCIE) must be supplied by the using agency.
    22.3. Tagging/Labeling. Tag or label electrical power outlets, connectors, or receptacles with a technical
    description of the type or amplitude of a voltage source, the power rating, and phase or connection scheme, and
    indicate the breaker servicing them.
    22.4. Wiring Installation. Install electrical wiring in metal raceways, concealed but accessible, in attics,
    plenums, or utility housings. Install wiring for frequencies greater than 60 Hz in nonferrous raceways and label
    with the correct frequency. Extend utilities into the calibration and repair area within utility chases concealed
    in walls and partitions. Do not use under-the-ceiling utility services. Direct overhead utility connections to
    workbenches and stations are permitted if the most feasible and economical and if the design minimizes dust
    collection. Use gaskets and seals to maintain room pressure and prevent dust infiltration where ducts, pipes,
    and conduit penetrate walls.

23. Electrical Utility Room. Install electrical facility equipment such as transformers, power distribution systems,
frequency converters, rectifiers, and voltage regulators in the utility room. The 28 Vdc power supply and the 400
Hz motor-generator will be provided by the using agency and installed by the contractor. Follow applicable
portions of National Electrical Code (NEC) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Standards. Pay particular attention to derating electrical equipment if boilers or other heat-generating equipment
are present. Provide Power Conditioning and Continuation Interface Equipment (PCCIE) for testing and powering
sensitive electronic equipment. The using agency (PMEL) must obtain PCCIE through the PCCIE Program Office,
SM-ALC/LIET, McClellan AFB CA 95652, DSN 633-0181, or (916) 643-6570/6777/0901. PCCIE maintenance
is the responsibility of the using agency.

24. Emergency Electrical Power Disconnects. Emergency electrical power switches or disconnects are
recommended at a central location in every room of the calibration area. They should be well-marked,
unobstructed, and have a lockout feature. Electrical power switches should not turn off the overhead lights.

25. Antenna Ports. The PMEL requires an antenna port installed during construction. Port location is dependent
on the location of such instruments as precise time (GPS) receivers. Antenna port penetrations through
calibration walls should be properly finished and sealed to prevent loss of calibration area positive pressure.

26. Grounding. Install grounding in accordance with the NEC and the National Electrical Safety Code, except
that the grounding system must have a resistance to ground of less than 10 ohms. If less than 10 ohms cannot
reasonably be attained, a waiver must be sought from the MAJCOM electrical engineer and the PMEL Flight
Chief. Power the calibration/repair area from (an) isolation transformer(s) with the electrostatic shield between the
primary and secondary windings installed as a separately derived system as close as practical to the loads. Provide
an equipotential plane for the calibration/repair area where sensitive electronic equipment will be used.

27. Backup Power. Provide a means for connecting a portable backup power unit to serve critical circuits within
the PMEL. Use a double-throw switch; and, if feasible, provide a matching plug and receptacle approved by the
Base Civil Engineer. Locate the switch for easy access by a power unit. Comply with isolated neutral
requirements in NEC 250-5(d), Alternating-Current Circuits and Systems to be Grounded, Separately Derived
Systems.

28. Electrical Receptacles. Actual location and type of electrical receptacles must be considered, such as:
receptacles high on the wall for wall clocks or portable emergency lights; receptacles at mid-wall level for
connecting to work benches located along the walls. Do not use the common 60 Hz, 120 Vac receptacle for
28 Vdc, 50 Hz, or 400 Hz services. The electrical contractor can provide the approved type based on the NEC.
Install enough receptacles to allow for future changes in layout due to personal preferences, relocation of
measurement systems to balance heat load and air balance, or the addition of new measurement systems.
14                                                                            AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998

Recommend placing two duplex receptacles every six feet along each wall. Explosion-proof receptacles may be
required in areas where flammable materials are used.

29. Electrical Feeds. Separate electrical feeds are recommended for the calibration areas.

30. Main Power Panels and Main Electrical Feeds. If possible, especially in areas of inclement weather, locate
access to main power panels inside the facility. Main power panels should be marked as discussed in paragraph
22.3.

31. Internal Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)/Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) Control. Within the
laboratory itself, interference suppression should include RF-shielded lenses, ballast RF suppressors, and power
line filters for fluorescent lighting. EMI/RFI is best controlled by following the guidance in MIL STD 188-124,
Grounding, Bonding, and Shielding for Common Long HaulTactical Communications Systems Including Ground
Based Communication, and MIL STD 188-125, High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) for Ground-Based
C4I Facilities Performing Critical, Time-Urgent Missions, Volume 1, Fixed Facilities (Metric); and MIL HDBK
419, Grounding, Bonding, and Shielding for Electronic Equipment and Facilities, and MIL HDBK 423, High-
Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Protection for Fixed and Transportable Ground-Based C4I Facilities.

Section G—Lighting
32. Calibration/Repair Area. Use permanent overhead-recessed fluorescent fixtures sealed with gaskets to
prevent air or moisture leakage and dust accumulation/intrusion from the interstitial area, satisfying ANSI C78.2,
Fluorescent Lamps - Preheat Start Types - Dimensional and Electrical Characteristics. Light fixture electrical
circuits should be on separate electrical feeds from instrumentation circuits. Individual light controls are required
for areas where radiant energy can affect measurements. If recessed fixtures can’t be used during renovation of an
existing PMEL, light fixtures surface-mounted on the ceiling may be used, providing the fixtures are streamlined to
avoid catching dust particles.

33. Illuminance. Facilities shall require a minimum uniform illumination of 100 foot-candles calculated at the
midlife of the tubes as measured at bench level in the calibration/repair areas. Light shall be evenly distributed to
minimize glare, spectral reflection, and radiant heat to the extent that measurements are nominally unaffected by
any of these parameters. Other areas must conform to the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) Lighting
Handbook. Zone lighting by work area and provide switches near the air lock entrance.

34. Emergency Lighting. Emergency lighting is required by NFPA Standard 101, Life Safety Code. Evaluate the
standard carefully, as its requirements may not include considerations for the unique layout and equipment
configurations in a metrology facility. Installed emergency lights are recommended. If a generator set is included,
wire emergency lights to automatically transfer from normal supply to the generator set. If portable lights are
mounted on the wall, locate an electrical receptacle near the light.

35. Explosion Proof Lighting. Regardless of the type of lighting, Class 1 Division 2 light fixtures should be used
in rooms housing pressurized flammable liquids.

Section H—Support Areas
36. Design Considerations. Quantities of workload, physical size of workload, proposed workload, or expansion
of workload are the primary factors determining design of PMEL support areas. From quantities of equipment that
will be received, processed, and stored daily, initial floor space requirements can be estimated. Human engineering
and the integration of other PMEL operations must be considered to determine location and layout of the support
areas. Locate these areas adjacent to the calibration and repair areas when possible, to reduce the distance delicate
test equipment must be moved. Equipment storage areas must be isolated from visitors for security and to prevent
unauthorized movement of equipment. A custom-built customer service counter effectively isolates the customer
AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                                      15

from equipment storage and processing areas. Typical support areas include: scheduling/receiving/equipment
storage with customer service counter; equipment cleaning room; technical library (if not in calibration area); office
space; conference room; janitorial supply room. NOTE: Hazardous materials used in the laboratory must be
considered in the design. The user will provide the designer a list of hazardous materials, including quantity, use,
and location in the laboratory.
    36.1. Mechanical. A temperature of 22.8 ± 3 °C (73 ± 6 °F) is recommended to allow equipment in the work
    queue to pre-stabilize near the calibration laboratory temperature (pre-soak period). HVAC air supply
    distribution to the support areas should not be on the same zone as the laboratory calibration areas.
    36.2. Electrical. Computer network, intercom, and telephone conduits and outlets should be installed during
    construction at enough locations to meet current layout and future expansion needs. Cabling should be
    installed in conduit in the walls, and in metal raceways above suspended ceilings. A door bell should be
    installed on the customer entry door. Electrical power loads should not be on the same circuits providing
    electricity to the calibration areas.
    36.3. Cleaning Room. A specially-equipped and isolated area is required for cleaning and washing
    mechanical, electrical, and electronic equipment. Requirements for the area are determined by the types of
    equipment to be serviced. Each cleaning unit and drying oven requires a minimum of 1.4 square meters (15
    square feet) additional floor space. A stainless steel sink and drain board with hot and cold water and exhaust
    hood is required. Locate the cleaning and washing area outside the calibration area. Supply utilities, services,
    furnishings, tools, and equipment equivalent to the following:
         36.3.1. Power: 120/240 Vac single-phase 20 amp circuit hard-wired to a government- or contractor-
         supplied electronic drying oven with disconnect switch. These circuits should not be connected to electrical
         distribution serving the calibration area.
         36.3.2. Compressed Air: Use an oil-free compressor to provide oil-free and clean dry instrument air at
         344 to 1379 kPa (50 to 200 psi), with 0.0017 m3/s @ 344 kPa (3.5 cfm @ 50 psi). Compressed air
         supplied to the cleaning station must have an adjustable regulator with a 0-35 psig range at the station.
         36.3.3. Cleaning System: Fresh hot and cold water supply and drain with mercury trap to be connected to
         the government supplied cleaning system and deep utility sink. Provide floor drain.
         36.3.4. Exhaust Vent: The cleaning area needs a canopy type fume hood with power exhauster for fume
         and vapor removal (see OSHA Standards 1910.94, Ventilation, and 1910.1000, Air Contaminants). The
         drying oven requires 6 cubic meters (212 cubic feet) per minute of room air for the purge blower intake and
         exhaust. The maximum temperature of the oven is 72 °C (163°F).
         36.3.5. Furnishings: Deep industrial sink, work bench with lipped stainless steel top that drains into the
         sink, storage cabinet for cleaning materials, trash cans, safety signs, fire extinguisher, storage for hand
         tools, stool, supplemental lighting.
         36.3.6. Vacuum: Vacuum port will be provided in the equipment cleaning room.
    36.4. Office. Locate the office for the PMEL manager and the administrative staff near the main laboratory
    entrance to control building access and receive visitors. Allow a maximum 9.3 square meters (100 square feet)
    per office occupant. Typical laboratory functions requiring office and administrative space include:
         36.4.1. Flight Chief.
         36.4.2. Laboratory Chief.
         36.4.3. Secretary, receptionist, word processor.
         36.4.4. Quality Assurance Supervisor.
    NOTE: A separate entrance should be provided for customers picking up or delivering workloads.
    36.5. Training and Conference Room. Allow 1.9 square meters (20 square feet) per projected room occupant.
    In sizing the room, consider: number of personnel that will use the room; and training aids and furnishings
    required. Recommend a small conference and training room be located near the laboratory manager's office;
    and the laboratory break and lunch (or other) rooms be used for larger meetings and training sessions. A
    smaller room near the Flight Chief’s office can also provide supplemental space for the lab manager for laying
    out special projects on a conference table during development stages.

Section I—68 Degree Rooms and Other Special Requirements
37. Modular Prefabricated PMEL Rooms.                  Modular environmental enclosure systems are available as
controlled laboratories for high precision metrology. Typically they are more cost effective than a 68 degree room
built as part of the facility. Their self-contained environmental system provides temperature and relative humidity
control, and dust particle filtration. The modular structure is normally erected inside a building, along with the
environmental control system, the electrical system, laboratory equipment, and furniture. Before contracting
construction of a modular environmental enclosure, consider: (1) environmental specifications for the 68 degree
room calibration laboratory 20 °C± 0.5 °C (68 °F±1 °F); (2) life cycle costs; (3) size (fits the space?); (4) possible
vibration and electromagnetic interference; and (5) volume and type of work to be processed. If an environmental
enclosure system is feasible, the design should include:

                               Design Features of Environmental Enclosure System
                  External duct work, plumbing, wiring, painting, and testing as part of the
                  installation.
                  An electrical supply system providing protection from voltage surges, spikes,
                  or transient noise.
                  Control equipment with a good earth ground.
                  A suitable drain for condensate disposal in the fan-coil area.
                  A smooth concrete floor for the enclosure installation, with maximum deviation
                  in the horizontal plane of 9.5 millimeters (3/8-inch).
                  Non-conductive vinyl floor covering.
                  If required for the humidification system, a year-round supply of potable water
                  operating at a flow rate and pressure required by the system.
                  If required for the HVAC system condenser cooling coil, a year-round supply
                  of water of the necessary minimum pressure, temperature, and flow-rate.
                  Possible use of an independent power supply for standby or to meet future load
                  requirements.

     37.1. Module Sizes. Following are sizes of various enclosures/modules available:

    37.3. Manufacturer’s Information. For further information and examples of manufacturers of prefabricated
    PMELs, contact AFMETCAL/DET 1/MLEE, 813 Irving-Wick Drive West, Suite 4M, Heath OH, 43056-
    6116.

38. RADIAC Calibration Areas. Radioactive materials, such as Americium 241, Cesium 137, Krypton 85,
Plutonium 239 and Thorium 232, are used in devices calibrated in selected licensed PMELs. These isotopes are
also used as calibration standards. When not properly shielded or used, these materials can generate dangerous
levels of radioactivity. Positive pressure is not required in RADIAC calibration areas; neutral or negative
pressures are acceptable. Also, most Type IIB laboratories are calibrating only low-level radiation instruments and
do not require special construction. Special shielding needs to be considered in facility design only when using
RADIAC sources which emit more than 2.6×10-4 coulombs per kilogram of air (1 roentgen) per hour. Currently,
only laboratories using the J.L. Shepherd 81-10 source qualify as using high-intensity sources. Reference Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) Title 10 CFR 20, Standards for Protection Against Radiation. Calibration, leak
testing, and otherwise processing these devices can be accomplished only in those activities authorized to do so, and
by trained personnel. Storage, calibration, maintenance, shipping, and disposal of devices containing radioactive
material is subject to detailed control, such as that specified by the NRC and the U. S. Air Force Radioisotope
Committee, Brooks AFB, Texas. NRC and Agreement States have requirements for facility construction to house
radioactive sources and RADIAC equipment. Recommend these requirements be identified through the A/E firm or
builder.

39. Force and Pressure Measurement Areas. Safety screens or shields may be required in the immediate
vicinity of force and pressure calibration equipment to protect operators and other laboratory personnel from flying
projectiles, high pressure gas, or fluids. Consider placing such equipment in isolated areas or separate rooms as an
added measure for personnel and equipment protection.

40. Liquid Flow Calibration Area. A specially-equipped, isolated area is required in PMELs which perform
liquid flowmeter calibration involving flammable liquids. The building housing a liquid flow calibration area must
be constructed of non-combustible or fire resistive materials as defined by the National Fire Protection Association.
This generally refers to masonry, reinforced concrete, or protected steel construction. The facility also must be
equipped with a minimum of two exits, separated to preclude both being cut off in the event of a localized fire.
     40.1. Floor Space. Determine floor space by considering the type and number of flow calibrators necessary to
     accommodate the workbench. Allocate additional space as necessary for workbenches and for storage of tools,
     ancillary equipment, and for walkways.
     40.2. Ceiling Height. Ceiling height must be adequate for housing flow calibrators and for performing in-place
     maintenance. Ceiling and wall finish will be in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph 13.
18                                                                           AFMAN 32-1094 1 NOVEMBER 1998

     40.3. Flooring. Use conductive flooring for installation in NFPA 70, National Electrical Code, Class I,
     Group D, Division 2 hazardous classified locations as specified.
     40.4. Water Supply. Supply hot and cold water considering the requirements of flow calibrator heat
     exchangers. Minimum service will consist of 1.26 L/s (20 gpm) of 4.4 ± 2.7 °C (40 ± 5 °F) chilled water and
     1.26 L/s of 71.1 ± 11.1 °C (160 ± 20 °F) heated water. Service must be adequate to support the simultaneous
     operation of all major systems in the facility.
     40.5. Compressed Air and Nitrogen. Compressed air and nitrogen must be supplied considering the
     requirements for the type and number of flow calibrators necessary to accommodate the workload.
     Compressed air delivered to flow calibrators shall be of instrument quality conforming to the requirements of
     ANSI/ISA S7.3. Compressed nitrogen shall conform to the requirements of Federal Specification BB-N-411,
     Type I, Class I grade B or MIL-P-27401. Service shall be adequate to support the simultaneous operation of
     all major systems in the facility.
     40.6. Fluid Waste. Use drip pans, barriers, or other suitable methods of containment to prevent spills of
     flammable, contaminated, caustic or waste fluids other than water from entering drain pipes or sewer systems.
     40.7. Wastewater. Provide wastewater considering the requirements of the flow calibrators.
     40.8. Ventilation. Ventilate the facility in accordance with the requirements of Title 29 CFR 1910,
     Occupational Safety and Health Standards . This includes a ventilation rate of not less than 4.25 liters per
     second per square meter (1 cubic foot per minute per square foot) of solid floor area.
     40.9. Environmental Controls. Facilities housing temperature-controlled flow calibrators do not require
     environmental controls. All other facilities shall respect extremes in environmental conditions below 18.3 °C
     (65 °F) and above 29.4 °C (85 °F) or rapid changes in environmental temperature exceeding 2.2 °C (4 °F) per
     hour.
     40.10. Flammable Liquids. Flammable liquid storage and handling shall be in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.

41. Azimuth Reference:
    41.1. Azimuth Station Locations. The Air Force has established eight North Seeking Gyrocompass
    Verification Facilities to support the calibration requirements of gyrocompass units. The purpose of these
    facilities is to provide accurate astronomical azimuth or directional standards for verifying the accuracy of the
    gyrocompass units. Equipment such as fixtures, plates, optical elements, stands, and other related items used in
    the calibration have been assembled in the Azimuth Reference System (ARS-1), NSN 4920-01-149-6391.
    Customers having requirements to set up a verification facility for supporting gyrocompass calibration
    requirements should contact AFMETCAL DET 1/MLEE, 813 Irving-Wick Drive West, Suite 4M, Heath OH
    43056-6116, for technical assistance in establishing new verification facilities. The methodology for
    supporting critical azimuth requirements varies depending on accuracy requirements for items being supported..
    41.2. Azimuth Reference Details. Each facility has an external azimuth reference line terminating at a target
    monument. The line ranges in length up to one mile, depending on location. The primary azimuth references
    are established within the facility by an optical target collimator located on an isolated pier. The directions of
    the external line and the normals to the collimator are determined by observing Polaris (the North Star) from
    outside the facility. Transfer of direction from Polaris and/or the line to the optical reference is accomplished
    using a precision theodolite. The PMEL verification facility is an environmentally controlled facility. Facilities
    must be located to permit laying out unobstructed lines of sight to the target monument, ranging 45 degrees
    either side of astronomic north, and in an area relatively free from vibrational disturbances such as heavy local
    traffic. The test area in the PMEL must provide a steady state internal environment with regard to temperature
    and air movement. Stable piers are provided for the optical reference collimator and temperature is maintained
    at 22.2 ± 3.3 °C (72 ± 6 °F) through the year. A precision optical window assembly is located on the external
    wall of the PMEL to permit external observations of Polaris, the indoor reference collimator, and the target
    monument. This design permits direct, single-azimuth transfers between Polaris, the indoor target collimator,
    and the external azimuth reference line.
    41.3. Updates. Determination of the direction of the reference line does not stop after the facility becomes
    operational. Observations will be made by the Defense Mapping Agency geodetic surveyors annually.

Section J—Commissioning
42. Standards. The designer must follow Army Corps of Engineers Engineer Regulation 1110-345-723, Systems
Commissioning Procedures, in developing commissioning standards. The end result must be a facility where the
primary emphasis is to design, construct, inspect, and accept a complete and operational facility.

Terms

Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program (AFMETCAL Program)—The composite of measurement
standards, metrologists, a system of world-wide laboratory facilities (commonly known as PMELs), calibration
data, and integrated planning to provide a disciplined Air Force program to assure the optimum reliability and
accuracy of systems, subsystems, and equipment.

Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL)—PMELs use base measurement standards to maintain
working standards. The working standards are used to maintain (troubleshoot, align, repair, and calibrate) Test,
Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) designated as PMEL responsibility. Authorizations for PMEL
equipment and facility requirements are tailored to meet specific requirements for supported missions. PMELs are
the base-level link for measurement transfer and maintenance self-sufficiency for all systems in the Air Force.
