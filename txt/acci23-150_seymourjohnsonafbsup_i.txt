                      GENERAL MOBILITY BAG MANAGEMENT

3.1. Policy. HQ USAF has established three mobility bags: Type A (general purpose), Type B
(extreme cold weather) and Type C (chemical warfare defense). ACC has also established an
A-1 bag, which is required to increase rapid deployment capability. The A-1 bag is derived from
the A-bag and consists of individual protective equipment IAW AFI 10-2501. Type C bags are
required IAW AFI 10-2501. The specific contents of each type mobility and organization bag
are listed in attachments 4 through 11. Type D/D-1 organization bags are maintained by Aircrew
Life Support as outlined in chapter 6. Units requiring additional nonstandard items are
responsible for the storage and maintenance of those items as organizational equipment.
3.2. Mobility Bag Authorizations. Mobility bag authorizations are based upon Non-Standard
Unit Type Codes (NSUTC) identified in the Air Force World-Wide UTC Summary (AFWUS),
supported unit requirements and safety levels as authorized by Air Staff policy guidance.
   3.2.1. LRS Readiness Flight will submit mobility bag requirements annually, NLT 1
   September. Wing/tenant units will submit changes of their baseline to the LRS Readiness
   Flight on a quarterly basis only if they experience a 10% change in their requirements. This
   validation process is as follows:
       3.2.1.1. LRS Readiness Flight will forward authorizations for type A, B, and C mobility
       bags, gas masks and weapons to HQ ACC/A3XD for validation, using the AFWUS as a
       basis for computations. LRS Readiness Flight should ensure authorizations include
       requirements for non-ACC tenant units.
          3.2.1.1.1. HQ ACC/A3XD will validate wing authorizations and will publish formal
          correspondence annually, NLT 1 November.
          3.2.1.1.2. ACC/A4LI will apply appropriate safety levels to wing authorizations and
          publish specific line item authorization, NLT 1 December.
          3.2.1.1.3. The LRS War Readiness Section will be responsible for updating MICAS
          immediately with new authorizations in regards to tariff requirements (see
          Attachment 2 and Attachment 3).
   3.2.2. If existing mobility authorizations do not support mission requirements, i.e. notional
   tasking, LRS Readiness Flight will coordinate an increase/decrease request via formal
   correspondence through their wing to HQ ACC/A3XD and A4LIP.
   3.2.3. Quarterly reviews that warrant change (10 percent increase/decrease in authorizations)
   will be forwarded to HQ ACC/A3XD and A4LIP for validation. Otherwise, mobility bag
   authorizations will remain firm for one year.
3.3. Mobility Bag Storage. The LRS War Readiness Section will centrally store mobility bags.
Exceptions exist as identified in this chapter; however, the LRS/CC maintains ultimate
responsibility.
   3.3.1. Mobility bags may be stored in any configuration identified by the LRS/CC. If stored
   in built-up configuration, use tariff size guidelines found in Attachment 2 and Attachment 3.

   accomplished annually.
3.4. Gas Mask Management. Gas mask authorizations equal: the total wartime commitment
(NSUTCs A/DWS, A/DWX, A/DXS, and A/DXX) and the number derived from the AFWUS.
All remaining masks (to include the 5% safety level) will be retained in the LRS War Readiness
Section to offset sizing differences, support of notional tasking, and inclusion in the mask
support kits. Wing commanders may elect to centrally store all masks in the LRS War Readiness
Section
   3.4.1. Unit Deployment Managers will establish local procedures to account for masks
   issued by LRS War Readiness Section. Precautions should be taken to prevent improper
   storage of masks that may result in disbonding or which may negatively affect the proper
   form and fit of these masks.
