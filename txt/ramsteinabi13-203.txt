This publication implements AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic, Airfield, Airspace and Range Management.
It describes the operational environment for Ramstein AB and the local area, and prescribes
policies/procedures for air traffic control (ATC), airfield management (AM), airspace, and flight
line activities. The provisions of this instruction are directive in nature and apply to all
assigned/attached units. Pilots may deviate from the procedures contained herein in the interest
of flying safety or when directed by Langen Air Control Center (ACC), Ramstein ground
controlled approach (GCA), Ramstein control tower, or other competent authority. NOTE: All
altitudes in this instruction are mean sea level (MSL) unless specified otherwise or when
referring to weather minimums. Aircrew and ground personnel should refer to Notices to
Airmen (NOTAM) and AM for up-to-date information. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims/index.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

In, VFR Low Altitude Tactical Straight-In and VFR Curvilinear Approach procedures. Chapter
4: deleted availability and restrictions for Surveillance and PAR Approaches; changed go-
around phraseology to match current tower/GCA operations letter; changed GCA‘s VHF
common use frequency. Chapter 5: removed building number associated with alternate control
tower and changed evacuation point for non-essential tower personnel to the GCA; changed
required VHF frequency the tower needs to monitor in the event the GCA evacuates; changed
the GCA‘s VHF frequency in the evacuation broadcast phraseology tower uses when evacuating;
changed airfield lighting requirement reference when tower is operating out of the alternate
control tower; deleted requirement for tower to have aircraft contact Chief 2 on 282.7 because
the requirement no longer exists. Chapter 7: changed all reference to IMT system use to GDSS2
system use. Chapter 8: added change to alleviate confusion about when an aircraft using the call
sign ―AIR EVAC or MED EVAC‖ becomes a priority; changed reference to IMT system to
GDSS2; added ―AMC‖ Departures to the list of local aircraft priorities; clarified required
separation between an opposite direction IFR arrival vs. IFR arrival to the runway in use; deleted
lost communication procedures associated with a PAR; specified who can conduct NVG
helicopter operations within Ramstein Air Base Class D Airspace; changed SFO wording to
alleviate confusion in the intent of the paragraph; added hearing protection information for
flightline personnel Attachment 7: combined VFR Random Steep and Spiral Up Departure
procedures and added new figure; added VFR Random Shallow figure; added VFR High
Altitude Tactical Straight-In Approach procedures and figure; added VFR Low Altitude Tactical
Straight-In Approach procedures and figure; added VFR Curvilinear Approach procedures and
figure. Attachment 8: corrected VFR departure procedure wording to alleviate confusion and
conflict. NOTE: The 86 AW and 435 ABW were reorganized on 16 July 2009 into the 86
AW and 435 AGOW. All previous 435 ABW organizations, functions and units are now
part of the 86 AW while the CRG and the ACOMG have moved to the 435 AGOW.

1.2. Runway Selection Procedures.
     1.2.1. Rwy 26 is designated the primary calm wind runway. Rwy 26 shall be designated as
     the runway in use whenever the prevailing wind speed is less than 5 knots regardless of wind
     direction (exception, see paragraph 1.2.3.).
     1.2.2. Whenever the wind speed exceeds 4 knots, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower watch
     supervisor shall use the Runway Determination Aid (see Attachment 11) to help determine
     which runway to use.
     1.2.3. The ATC tower watch supervisor may designate a runway in use other than that
     favored by the prevailing wind when an operational advantage will be gained. Example:
     Availability of navigational Aid (NAVAIDs), arresting systems, approach lighting to specific
     runways; weather cells east/west of field, existing traffic conditions/volume when wind
     speed/direction changes, etc.
     1.2.4. Pilot requests for opposite direction operations will be approved on a workload
     permitting basis.
     1.2.5. Rwy 26 shall be designated as the runway in use, regardless of weather conditions,
     during all periods when the interval between operations (departures or arrivals) equals or
     exceeds one hour. Tower shall continue to designate Rwy 26 as the runway in use until
     notified by Ground Controlled Approach (GCA), Langen Air Control Center (ACC) or an
     aircrew of an impending operation. Upon receiving notification of an impending operation,
     tower shall utilize the criteria in 1.2.1., 1.2.2. and/or 1.2.3 to select the runway in use.
     1.2.6. Runway change notification.
        1.2.6.1. Tower will coordinate with GCA prior to a runway change.
        1.2.6.2. Tower will notify Airfield Management (AM) and weather after a runway
        change.
        1.2.6.3. GCA will notify Langen ACC and Heidelberg Approach after a runway change.
        1.2.6.4. AM will notify the fire department alarm room, barrier maintenance (786
        CES/CEOE), command post, (86 AW/CP), transient alert (86 MXS/MXMTT),
        maintenance operations center (86 MOS/MOC) and air mobility control center (721
        AMS/MOC) after a runway change.
     1.2.7. Runway 09/27 Operations:
        1.2.7.1. Runway 09/27 shall be used as the primary taxi route for aircraft to and from
        Runway 08/26.
        1.2.7.2. When Runway 08/26 is not available for any reason, Runway 27 shall be
        designated as the secondary calm wind runway. Rwy 27 shall be designated as the
        runway in use whenever the prevailing wind speed is less than 5 knots regardless of wind
        direction (exception, see paragraph 1.2.3).
        1.2.7.3. At no time will Runway 08/26 and 09/27 be used as landing and or takeoff
        surfaces at the same time. Simultaneous operations to both runways are not authorized.
        1.2.7.4. Runway change notification. See para 1.2.6.1 through 1.2.6.4.

1.19. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures.
     1.19.1. IAW the Air Traffic Act Permit, during engine test runs only two engines per aircraft are
     allowed to be operated simultaneously under load conditions, unless necessary for mission
     accomplishment.
     1.19.2. The 86 AW MOC, 38 EAS MOC and 721 AMS MOC will coordinate all engine runs
     with control tower for approval. Engine run supervisors will ensure ground control is contacted
     for approval prior to engine start.
     1.19.3. Once approval is given, maintenance engine run supervisors will continue to monitor
     ground control. Aircraft radio transmissions to ground control will be kept to a minimum.
     1.19.4. The following periods are authorized for aircraft maintenance engine runs for all
     aircraft:
        1.19.4.1. Monday through Saturday: 0700L to 1900L.
        1.19.4.2. Sunday/German holidays: no engine runs.
        1.19.4.3. When the doors to the hush house are closed, engine runs in the hush house are
        authorized at all times. When the doors to the hush house are open, engine runs in the hush
        house must be conducted between 0700L and 1900L, Monday through Saturday.
     1.19.5. Deviation requests. Any requests for engine runs outside the above periods must be
     approved by the 86 OG/CC via 86 AW/CP. The 86 AW/CP will notify tower and AM of all
     quiet hour engine run approvals.
     1.19.6. Acceptable reasons for deviation requests:
        1.19.6.1. Mission degradation. Disapproved engine runs would cause mission degradation.
        1.19.6.2. Higher headquarters (HHQ) impact.          Disapproved engine run would cause
        HHQ/JCS mission impact.
        1.19.6.3. Generation of HHQ or JCS directed alert or missions has priority.
     1.19.7. Tower and AM will monitor airfield operations during quiet hours and notify the 86
     AW/CP of any deviations. Engine runs during quiet hours will not be approved without prior
     notification.
     1.19.8. Rules for C-5 and C-17 engine runs on ramp 5 are listed in Table 1.6. Rules for
     engine runs by base assigned aircraft are listed in Table 1.7. Engine run supervisors have
     full responsibility for ensuring the safety of all personnel and equipment during engine runs
     and must be aware of tower's blind spots as described in paragraph 1.25.

     1.20.1. Reverse thrust. Aircrews will use powered reverse thrust to the minimum extent
     necessary for safe operations.
     1.20.2. Approach procedures. Aircrews will utilize German civil airfield approach
     procedures as specified in FLIP AP/2 to the maximum extent possible. For ILS approaches,
     crews should establish final configuration by the final approach fix as depicted for the
     localizer approach.
     1.20.3. Visual approaches should avoid overflight of towns and villages. When approaching
     from the east, execute the Autobahn 6 Visual Approach for Rwy 26 or 27 to avoid overflight
     of the city center.
     1.20.4. Quiet hours. Ramstein AB quiet hours are defined as periods when only mission-
     essential arrivals/departures/engine runs will be authorized. Authorization is on a case-by-
     case basis.
     1.20.4.1. Established quiet hours for arrivals and departures at Ramstein AB are in
     effect Monday through Saturday, 2200L to 0600L. Engine start is not authorized prior to
     0600L without a quiet hour waiver.
         1.20.4.2. On Sundays and German holidays, quiet hours remain in effect until 1300L.
         Engine start is approved 30 minutes prior to the end of quiet hours but aircraft cannot
         depart prior to 1300L.
     1.20.5. Quiet hour waivers. 86 OG/CC is the approval authority for all quiet hour waivers.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                             25

      1.20.5.2. In turn, 86 AW/CP coordinates approval with 86 OG/CC and notifies the
      applicable agency for final approval/disapproval; 86 AW/CP will notify tower and AM of
      any approvals daily. NOTE: Control tower personnel have approval authority to taxi
      aircraft to parking that land at or before 2200L.
   1.20.6. Quiet hour policy guidance. The following general guidance will be applied to
   reduce noise pollution during set quiet hours without negatively impacting the mission.
      1.20.6.1. Aircrews and maintainers will operate their aircraft/engines so as to produce
      the least amount of noise consistent with safety of flight/mission accomplishment.
      1.20.6.2. During quiet hours, pilots with quiet hour approval are only authorized one
      instrument approach to a full stop landing and/or one departure.
      1.20.6.3. Aircraft are not authorized VFR patterns on weekends and German holidays
      except in emergency situations or upon approval by the 86 OG/CC.
      1.20.6.4. When quiet hour operations are authorized, tower will advise pilots to avoid
      overflight of populated areas.
   1.20.7. Avoidance of populated areas. Aircraft will avoid overflying the areas identified in
   Attachment 6 to the maximum extent possible, except as required in an emergency, or when
   executing a departure procedure (DP). NOTE: If VMC on a DP/ATC instructions, course
   corrections to avoid the areas in Attachment 6 are approved until leaving the class D
   airspace.
   1.20.8. Avoidance of USAFE HQ and CC Air Ramstein area. To the maximum extent
   possible, aircraft will avoid over flight of the areas on Ramstein Air Base encompassing
   USAFE headquarters and CC Air Ramstein buildings below 3600 feet MSL. Arriving VFR
   aircraft will be instructed to land via runway or taxiways in such a manner that avoids this
   area. Transient VFR aircraft when crossing the airport north/south bound will be instructed
   to cross the east or west ends of the runway and avoid mid field over flight. Transient VFR
   aircraft crossing the class delta surface area east/west bound will remain south of the runway
   or four miles north until past the end of the runway for their direction of flight. Pipeline
   inspection helicopters, federal agency and emergency response operations aircraft are exempt
   from this restriction.
1.21. ILS CAT I/II/IIIa Procedures/Protection of the ILS Critical Areas.
   1.21.1. Protection of the ILS Critical Areas is IAW BesAnMilFS 2-100. See Attachments 2
   and 3 for depiction of ILS CAT I/II/IIIa critical areas.
      1.21.1.1. No aircraft, vehicle, or personnel shall be allowed in, or be allowed to enter
      into the ILS critical area when an ILS approach is in progress. Refer to paragraph

   can receive Ramstein tower VHF but must hover at or above 60 ft to transmit.
1.26. Quiet Hour/Ramp Freeze Requests.
   1.26.1. Quiet periods and ramp freezes may be requested for ceremonies and events taking
   place on Ramstein‘s airfield when noise reduction from aircraft operations, flight line ground
   support equipment and flight line vehicles is required.
   1.26.2. There are three main types of ramp freezes and quiet periods issued at Ramstein.
      1.26.2.1. Motivational wing or MAJCOM runs. There is a specific run route approved
      for the flight line. The route is depicted in Attachment 10. Motivational runs are
      authorized 90 minutes of ramp freeze and quiet period. This time starts 30 minutes prior
      to the start of the run and ends 1 hour after the start of the run. The wording for the quiet
      period and ramp freeze is as follows: No engine runs, taxis, tows, APU/GTC, or hush
      house engine runs with open doors authorized on Ramps 2 or 3 nor on Twy Delta
      adjacent to these ramps during this time frame. North/south vehicle traffic on Mitchell
      Ave across Ramps 2 and 3 is not authorized. Vehicle movement on Ramp 2, east of Spot
      2-3 is authorized.
      1.26.2.2. Retreat ceremonies. Retreats ceremonies are held on Ramp 3 next to building
      2201. Retreat ceremonies are authorized 40 minutes of ramp freeze and quiet period.
      This time starts 10 minutes prior to the start of the retreat and ends 30 minutes after the
      start of the retreat. The wording for the quiet period and ramp freeze is as follows: No
      engine runs, taxis, tows, APU/GTC or hush house engine runs authorized on Ramps 2, 3
      or 4 nor on Twy Delta adjacent to these ramps during this time frame. North/south
      vehicle traffic on Mitchell Ave across Ramps 2 and 3 is not authorized. Vehicle
      movement on Ramp 2, east of Spot 2-7 is authorized.
      1.26.2.3. Change of command ceremonies. Change of command ceremonies held in
      aircraft hangars are authorized 90 minutes of ramp freeze and quiet period. The quiet
      period and ramp freeze restrictions will depend on location of the event. An example for
      a change of command held in Hanger 1 is as follows: No engine runs, taxis, tows,
      APU/GTC or hush house engine runs authorized on Ramps 1 or 2 nor on Twy Delta
      adjacent to these ramps during this time frame. Vehicle movements are not authorized on
      Ramp 2 or Taxiway Delta adjacent to Ramp 2, except for emergency support vehicles or

        1.26.4.3. Prior coordination. Coordinate with the 37 AS, 38 EAS, 76 AS, 86 AMXS, 86
        MXS, 86 AW/PA, 435 ABW/CCP and 86 OSS/OSO either electronically or via fax.
        Coordination with these agencies may be accomplished simultaneously rather than
        sequentially (no need to obtain a signature from one before moving on to the next).
        1.26.4.4. Staff Summary Sheet. Initiate a Staff Summary Sheet, AF IMT 1768, or
        Electronic Staff Summary Sheet (E-SSS), prior to the planned event. Compile the
        responses from the prior coordination (as listed in paragraph 1.26.4.3.) onto a single AF
        IMT 1768 or E-SSS by entering the name and date of approval in the appropriate
        signature block. Forward the completed and coordinated AF IMT 1768 or E-SSS to 86
        OSS/OSA NLT 7 days before the planned quiet period. 86 OSS will then submit the
        request to the 86 OG/CC for approval.
        1.26.4.5. Upon review of the AF IMT 1768 or E-SSS by the 86 OG/CC, requesting
        agency will be notified by e-mail of the approved length of quiet period and specific
        details of the ramp freeze.
     1.26.5. Upon receipt of ramp freeze and quiet period approval from the 86 OG/CC, 86
     OSS/OSAM will disseminate a ramp freeze message via e-mail to all affected organizations
     and will issue a NOTAM via the Defense Internet NOTAM Service website.

                                            Chapter 3

                      VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) PROCEDURES

3.1. VFR Weather Minimums. Visual flight rules are in effect when observed weather is equal
to or greater than 1500 ft ceiling and/or equal to or greater than 5000 meters prevailing visibility.
For noise abatement purposes, fighter aircraft will not depart VFR with ceiling less than 3700 ft
and prevailing visibility less than 5000 meters.
3.2. VFR Traffic Patterns. See Attachments 4 and 6.
   3.2.1. Class D airspace entry procedures, standard tower frequency/VFR reporting points.
       3.2.1.1. Pilots must establish two-way radio communication with the control tower and
       obtain approval for the requested pattern to be flown prior to entering class D airspace.
       3.2.1.2. The primary control tower radio frequency for all aircraft conducting operations
       in class D airspace is VHF 133.2.
       3.2.1.3. The VFR reporting points are ECHO (062-R/5.2 DME), WISKY (291-R/6.6
       DME) and PIVOT (352-R/6.6 DME). All radials and DME are from Ramstein‘s
       TACAN. NOTE: Pilots must be familiar with the VFR entry/reporting points listed in
       Attachment 4 prior to working in class D airspace. Unless otherwise coordinated, enter
       class D airspace and proceed to the approved reporting point at or below 3000 MSL.
CAUTION: Expect extensive glider activities in the vicinity of Ramstein AB during VFR
conditions. Local gliders are not in communication with Ramstein GCA and are not transponder
equipped to provide traffic alerting and collision avoidance system guidance. Local glider parks
are located 5 NM west of WISKY point and 1 NM north of PIVOT point. Aircrews should be
extremely vigilant in looking for glider traffic when operating in the vicinity of Ramstein.
CAUTION: All local assigned aircraft will exercise caution when traversing the WISKY,
PIVOT, and ECHO points in the local pattern. The Potzberg Hotel (Castle) performs aviary
shows at their location. The risk of striking a very large predatory bird is increased over the area
and aircrews must avoid direct over-flight. Crews should plan to avoid the area (49˚31.20‘ N
and 7˚28.80‘ E) by at least ½ NM.
   3.2.2. Transient aircraft are not authorized in the VFR traffic pattern unless an emergency
   situation exists and is necessary for aircraft performance. This restriction may be waived by
   the 86 OG/CC. NOTE: USAFE fighter aircraft are authorized to recover using the overhead
   pattern. However, aircraft desiring multiple approaches must execute their option back to the
   GCA radar pattern.
   3.2.3. VFR patterns are authorized for use by all locally assigned aircraft, unless otherwise
   specified.
   3.2.4. Pattern use/deviations.
       3.2.4.1. All VFR patterns are considered in use during normal operating hours (Monday
       through Friday 0600L to 2200L), weather permitting.
       3.2.4.2. All aircraft executing VFR patterns will take care to avoid towns in the Ramstein
       vicinity (see Attachment 6).
36                                                 RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009


         3.2.4.3. VFR patterns are closed during quiet hours, weekends and German holidays.
         3.2.4.4. When authorizing pattern deviations, tower will advise pilots to avoid overflight
         of populated areas. See paragraph 1.20. for quiet hour approval requirements. NOTE:
         Aircraft executing multiple VFR pattern approaches to Rwy 26 or Rwy 27 will not start
         their crosswind turn until abeam the water tower. All towns referred to in pattern profiles
         can be found in Attachment 6.
     3.2.5. Closed traffic pattern. See Attachments 4 and 6 for depictions.
         3.2.5.1. Pattern altitude is 2000 MSL.
         3.2.5.2. Weather criteria. Ceiling at or above 1700 AGL and visibility at or above 5000
         m.
         3.2.5.3. Pattern profile. Remain outside Ramstein village, Miesenbach, and Ramstein
         AB housing area but inside Mackenbach. OPTIONS: Simulated engine-out pattern
         deviation requires control tower approval.
     3.2.6. Overhead pattern. See Attachment 4 for depiction.
         3.2.6.1. Pattern altitude is 3000 MSL until either WISKY or ECHO and 2500 MSL
         after passing WISKY or ECHO.
         3.2.6.2. Weather criteria. Ceiling at or above 2200 AGL and visibility at or above
         5000 m.
         3.2.6.3. Pattern profile. Proceed to WISKY at 3000 MSL for initial to Rwy 08/09 or
         ECHO at 3000 MSL for initial to Rwy 26/27, as directed by tower. Only right breaks
         will be made to both runways and pilots will remain clear of all no-fly areas.
         EXCEPTION: If ATC requires C-21 aircraft to break past the approach end when
         Rwy 08/09 are in use, a left break will be used to avoid overflying Kindsbach.
         Additionally, when a left break is used, C-21 aircraft will avoid overflying Ramstein
         village to the north and turn base around the water tower. Subsequent patterns will
         reenter initial avoiding no-fly areas (Attachment 6).
     3.2.7. Vectors to initial.
         3.2.7.1. Pattern altitude is assigned and will be no lower than 3600 MSL.
         3.2.7.2. Weather criteria. Ceiling at or above 2200 AGL and visibility at or above 5000
         m.
         3.2.7.3. Pattern profile. Pilots requesting vectors to initial will be vectored by Ramstein
         GCA to a point no closer than 7 NM on final approach at an assigned altitude no lower
         than 3600 MSL, unless otherwise coordinated with tower. NOTE: Aircraft enter the
         overhead pattern from WISKY and ECHO at 3000 MSL. After reporting the field in
         sight, pilots will be instructed to contact tower. Pilots who do not report the field insight
         by 6 NM final will be instructed to climb to at least 4000 MSL, then radar vectored into
         the radar pattern for an instrument approach.
     3.2.8. Protection of the overhead pattern. When the overhead pattern is in use, all departure
     aircraft will be instructed by the tower/GCA to maintain at or below 2000 MSL until
     departure end of runway.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                              37


   3.2.9. Holding procedures. When traffic dictates, aircraft will be instructed to hold at either
   WISKY or ECHO by tower personnel until resumption of the normal traffic pattern can
   continue. Aircraft are expected to circle to the north at 3000‘ MSL or ATC assigned altitude
   as standard unless specifically instructed otherwise by tower personnel.
   3.2.10. Aircraft will squawk 0033 in the VFR pattern or as directed by ATC.
3.3. Special Procedures.
   3.3.1. Helicopter operations. In addition to the runway, tower may authorize helicopters to
   arrive/depart from any portion of the controlled movement area or from any active taxiway.
   Helicopters will not be authorized to land directly on or takeoff directly from parking ramps.
   Additionally, controllers will not allow helicopters to over-fly Mitchell Ave on takeoff or
   landing. Inbound helicopters from the east, landing on Twy Delta and destined for Ramp 3
   or Ramp 4 shall be instructed to land prior to (east of) Mitchell Ave and taxi through the
   Mitchell Ave intersection. Helicopters departing toward the east shall be taxied onto Twy
   Delta and through the Mitchell Ave intersection before being issued takeoff clearance.
   Controllers shall activate the Mitchell Ave traffic lights prior to any aircraft (helicopter or
   fixed wing) being taxied through the Mitchell Ave intersection.
      3.3.1.1. Helicopter procedures are published in the Department of Defense Visual Flight
      Rules (VFR), Arrival/Departure routes Europe.
      3.3.1.2. Only helicopters from C Co 1-214th Aviation Regiment are authorized VFR
      practice approaches at Ramstein. Pattern altitudes are at or below 700‘ AGL/1500‘ MSL.
   3.3.2. Restricted low approaches with vehicles or personnel on runway.
      3.3.2.1. Tower is authorized to restrict low approaches at or above 500 AGL or 1000

                  INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR) PROCEDURES

4.1. Radar Traffic Pattern. The radar traffic pattern will normally be flown at 4000/5000
MSL, north or south downwind, and expect vectors from Ramstein GCA to the final approach
course. See Attachment 5.
4.2. IFR Departure Procedures. Tower is required by host nation agreement to request all IFR
departure clearances no earlier than 20 minutes prior to departure. Therefore, pilots can expect
their clearance with ground control after requesting taxi instructions. Standard instrument
departure procedures are listed in the DoD Flight Information Publication (Terminal) Vol-3,
High and Low Altitude Europe, North Africa and Middle East. When Rwy 26 is in use, the
Toley 2 departure is the preferred departure due to noise abatement.
4.3. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures. Radar vectors to initial and visual approaches are
available upon request, traffic permitting. For noise abatement, aircraft under control of
Ramstein GCA will be issued radar vectors to a point no closer than 7 NM straight-in final.
4.4. IFR Local Climbout Procedures. The following IFR climbout instructions apply only to
locally assigned aircraft.
     4.4.1. Standard local climbout procedures are listed below. The ATC phraseology has been
     abbreviated for base assigned aircraft IAW AFI 13-203, Ch. 6.
        4.4.1.1. ATC Phraseology: ―AFTER COMPLETING (low approach, touch and go,
        option), EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT RUNWAY (designator), TRACK
        050/269/275 (if applicable).‖
NOTE The use of ―LOCAL CLIMBOUT‖ phraseology constitutes an abbreviated IFR clearance
for locally assigned aircraft that are transitioning from tower to the Ramstein radar pattern.
        4.4.1.2. Rwy 08 local climbout:
CLIMB ON TRACK 080 TO 4000 WITH A MINIMUM CLIMB GRADIENT OF 270 FT/NM TO
1500. AT 3 DME/2NM TURN LEFT ON TRACK 360.
        4.4.1.3. Rwy 09 local climbout:

      4.4.1.7. Rwy 27 local climbout 269 track:
CLIMB ON TRACK 269 TO 4000.
NOTE: During TACAN out procedures, aircraft will be given NM versus DME.
   4.4.2. Protection of the overhead pattern. When the overhead pattern is in use, all departure
   aircraft will be instructed by the tower/GCA to maintain at or below 2000 MSL until
   departure end of runway.
4.5. IFR Arrival Procedures.
   4.5.1. Unless otherwise requested, pilots should expect ILS approach.
   4.5.2. Frequency use. Ramstein GCA common VHF frequency 140.9/124.275 should be
   used as the primary and UHF frequency 356.225 as the secondary when conducting flight
   operations in the radar traffic pattern. All aircraft will be changed to a discrete frequency
   when handed off to the final controller.
   4.5.3. Reference speeds. C-130: 170 KIAS; C-21: 200 KIAS; C-20: 200 KIAS; and C-40: 200
   KIAS.

   authorized south of Rwy 08/26 IAW DoD Terminal FLIP. Pilots will avoid overflying the
   villages listed in Attachment 6 to the maximum extent possible. Tower will instruct
   transient aircrews to avoid overflying local villages to the maximum extent possible. If
   executing an approach to Rwy 08 and circling to land 26, use CAT C mins and if executing
   an approach to Rwy 26 to circle to land 08, use CAT E mins (noise abatement).
   4.5.5. Full stop/stop and go operations. Aircraft that desire a full stop/stop and go landing
   shall advise each ATC facility on initial call-up to aid in sequencing other aircraft in the
   pattern.
   4.5.6. C-130 formation procedures. GCA should allow for 1 NM per aircraft in formation
   between turns/vectors (i.e., flight of four requires 4 NM between turns/vectors).
4.6. Breakout/Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
   4.6.1. Break out procedures. When an aircraft/flight is at 6 miles or farther: "CLIMB AND
   MAINTAIN 5000, FLY RUNWAY HEADING, ACKNOWLEDGE."
   4.6.2. Go around procedures.
      4.6.2.1. When an aircraft/flight is less than 6 miles: "MAINTAIN 2000, FLY RUNWAY
      HEADING, ACKNOWLEDGE."
      4.6.2.2. In case an aircraft is in departure position on the runway, tower will issue ―Go
      around left (Rwys 26/27) or right (Rwys 08/09).‖ Aircraft will offset 200 feet south of
      the runway, and then fly standard go around procedures. NOTE: The 2000 ft restriction
      may be deleted after coordination with tower.
   4.6.3. Missed approach procedures. Pilots will fly the missed approach procedure for the
   published approach they are on, unless otherwise instructed by ATC. If no published missed
   approach procedure exists, pilots will execute go around procedures and notify ATC.

6.1. Responsibilities. A detailed outline of Ramstein AB flight line vehicle/pedestrian
operations can be found in RABI 13-201, Control of Vehicles and Personnel Operating on the
Airfield. Only mission essential government vehicles and other approved vehicles displaying the
appropriate flight line pass are permitted in the CMA as defined in paragraph 1.3. Two-way
radio communications must be established with Ramstein tower prior to entering the CMA. The
airfield manager will develop a local flight line driver‘s familiarization program, train unit
vehicle control officers/flight line driving program managers and inspect a minimum of one
unit‘s flight line driving program each quarter. These procedures are outlined in RABI 13-201.
Unit commanders will ensure training is conducted, a program manager is selected, and limit
flight line driving authorization to only those personnel requiring flight line driving to
accomplish their duties. Commanders will conduct a face to face briefing with all newly
assigned and certified drivers outlining the seriousness of driving on the flight line, aircraft
movement, the importance of clear communication, the requirement to use operational risk
management to assess activities prior to entering flight line and the fact that safety is paramount
in all activities on and around the flight line. Unit flight line driving program managers will
perform their duties as outlined in RABI 13-201.
6.2. Flight line Driving Requirements. Flight line driving requirements can be found in RABI
13-201.

     are free of stones, trash or loose objects that could cause FOD prior to entering taxiways, at
     each FOD checkpoint and when entering airfield pavement from an unpaved surface.
        6.3.1.1. Foreign objects that could fall from truck beds or towed equipment must be
        secured or removed before crossing the taxiway. Flatbed trucks, pickup trucks and other
        vehicles with open storage areas will inspect and secure any debris that may fall out
        during motion or be blown out by the wind.
        6.3.1.2. At night, vehicle operators must use a flashlight to conduct FOD checks.
     6.3.1.3. If debris is still tracked onto the hard surface, the driver will stop the vehicle and
     pick up all debris before departing the area.
        6.3.1.4. If the debris cannot immediately be cleaned up due to excessive amounts, the
        driver will immediately contact AM by radio or by phone and request an airfield sweeper.
     6.3.2. Driving on unpaved surfaces is prohibited, except in an emergency situation or if
     required to perform official duties. Drivers of vehicles entering airfield pavements from an
     unpaved surface will check the vehicle tires for foreign objects.
     6.3.3. All vehicles that routinely operate on the flight line will be equipped with a FOD can
     and FOD pickers. FOD pickers are small metal picks shaped like a pen used to remove rocks
     from between tire treads.

6.8. Procedures for Gaining Access to the CMA. The CMA is depicted in Attachment 2 and
3 and described in paragraph 1.3. Aircraft, vehicles, or personnel will not operate in the CMA
without two-way radio communication and approval from tower. Approval for entry to CMA via
phone calls to tower or AM by third parties is prohibited, including during exercises or
emergencies. If circumstances beyond an individual‘s control preclude radio communication, they
must obtain an escort with 2-way radio capability before being granted access to the CMA.
NOTE: The NCAR is for mission essential vehicles only. The NCAR is not open to POVs and
will not be used as a short cut to transit to the north or south side of the airfield.
   6.8.1. Unless approved by AM, jogging on the flight line, to include the NCAR, runways,
   taxiways and parking ramps, is strictly prohibited.
   6.8.2. Pedestrians are prohibited from walking on or along the NCAR, with the exception of
   those participating in approved motivational runs as listed in paragraph 1.26.2.1 and along
   the motivational run route as depicted in Attachment 10.
   6.8.3. When instructed to depart the runway, the withdrawal distance will be a minimum of
   100 ft from the runway edge unless otherwise directed by ground control.
   6.8.4. Deviations. All CMA deviation requests (i.e., escort requests) will be
   forwarded to 86 OSS/OSAM for approval.
   6.8.5. Parking coordination. TA will inform tower of parking locations for all transient
   aircraft including base assigned aircraft transporting verified distinguished visitors (DV).
   Exception, TA will not provide parking locations for 38 EAS assigned aircraft and base
   assigned aircraft not transporting DV's.
   6.8.6. Communications failure with vehicles or personnel on runway.
       6.8.6.1. If a communication failure occurs between the tower and a vehicle/person on the
       runway, tower will use standard light gun signals IAW AFVA 13-221, Control Tower
       Light Signal Card, 1 November 2001and turn the high intensity runway lights (primary
       tower only) on and off to signal vehicle operators or pedestrians to depart the runway
       immediately. Personnel seeing the signal will exit the movement area immediately to a
       distance outside the runway distance markers/hold lines.
       6.8.6.2. If personnel are unable to establish/maintain 2-way radio communication with
       tower at any time while on the CMA, they must immediately exit the CMA by the most
       direct route that does not cross any runway and remain off of the CMA until
       communications can be regained or an escort can be dispatched to their location. NOTE:
       AM personnel may also be dispatched to escort personnel off the runway if needed
       during communications failure.
6.9. Emergency Vehicle Operations.
   6.9.1. Any emergency vehicle requiring access to the CMA will be on either the Fire
   Department ―District 1‖ or operations digital net and obtain permission for entry from tower
   IAW paragraph 6.8 above. If vehicles are unable to comply with 2-way radio
   communications requirements, they must obtain an escort with that capability before being
   granted access to the CMA.
   6.9.2. Operations FM net priorities:

                                              Chapter 7

                              FLIGHT PLANNING PROCEDURES

7.1. Responsibilities.
     7.1.1. Aircraft commanders:
        7.1.1.1. Ensure IFR flight plans are filed at least 4 hours prior to estimated time of
        departure (ETD), and VFR flight plans are filed 1 hour prior to ETD. Special operations
        and procedures may require earlier filing. Exceptions may be made when warranted; i.e.,
        flights into/through France must use the lead times published in Area Planning 2.
        7.1.1.2. Via the form, ensure their aircraft departing Ramstein AB have a flight plan on
        file with Eurocontrol prior to takeoff.
            7.1.1.2.1. Use DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, or other authorized
            form IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, and FLIP General Planning.
            7.1.1.2.2. Use the form or contact dispatch agency for all changes to flight plans prior
            to         departing.                 Instructions        are         posted          at
            https://amd.ramstein.af.mil/offices/sof/dispatch/.
     7.1.2. AMC procedures:
        7.1.2.1. AMC aircrews will have flight plans pre-filed through the integrated flight
        manager.
        7.1.2.2. AMC aircrews or AMC command post will coordinate any flight plan changes
        with the integrated flight manager or AMD.
     7.1.3. Locally assigned aircrews will:
        7.1.3.1. File flight plans electronically or contract dispatch agency.
        7.1.3.2. Contact AMD initiation cell to determine an alternate method when electronic
        filing is not possible.
        7.1.3.3. Contact flying squadron first for any flight plan changes needed while en route.
        Secondary, contact AM via the pilot to dispatch (PTD) radio. Changes may only be
        accomplished using predetermined stereo routing (provided by 37 AS/76 AS), kept on
        file at AM and each flying squadron. NOTE: Aircrews must fax a copy of their original
        flight plan to AM prior to departure for AM to make any changes via the PTD radio
        (IAW AFI 13-213, paragraph 3.2.10.). When a flight plan is faxed, it is the responsibility
        of the aircraft commander and/or flying squadron to call AM and confirm AM received
        the fax.
     7.1.4. If using a means other than the Form or contract dispatch agency to file flight plans,
     users and local flying squadrons will maintain original flight plans IAW the Air Force
     Records Disposition Schedule, table 13-7, rules 3 and 4, located electronically at
     https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. When offered a dispatch release, customers will sign, copy and
     maintain original dispatch, using the rules previously listed in this paragraph. NOTE: When
     a flight plan is faxed, it is the responsibility of the aircraft commander and/or flying squadron
     to call AMD initiation cell and confirm AMD received the fax.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                59


   7.1.5. AMD will transmit all flight plans as soon as received. Aircrews are encouraged to
   file outbound flight plans the day prior to ETD. Aircrews should build flight plan shell and
   store the data using the notional flight plan option on the GDSS2. Deviations to ETD and
   route of flight may cause flow control/slot time delays.
   7.1.6. AM will:
      7.1.6.1. Maintain a flight planning room equipped with two operational computers with
      access to the Ramstein LAN for transient US aircrews, and DOD flight planning
      publications to include one CD-ROM containing current Jeppesen terminal area
      procedures data for transient aircrews, foreign aircrews and local aircrews when squadron
      facilities are not available.
      7.1.6.2. Review flight plans filed at AM for completeness, clarity and signature. Submit
      all flight plans for US and foreign aircrews not supported by AMD or AMC IAW FLIP
      General Planning, AFJMAN 11-213, Military Flight Data Telecommunications System,
      and this instruction.
      7.1.6.3. Maintain original, hand delivered flight plans from transient aircrews IAW
      AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
      7.1.6.4. Initiate NOTAMS concerning the airfield environment and procedures into/out
      of Ramstein AB.
   7.1.7. Changes and deviations to flight plans.
      7.1.7.1. The pilot in command is responsible to identify flight plan changes due to
      weather, ground aborts or other mission requirements as soon as possible. The pilot may
      submit requests for changes to ATC for coordination with AMD. Expect a delay, for
      identification, while AMD coordinates a new slot time for departure.
      7.1.7.2. Once an aircraft is airborne, any corrections or deviations to a flight plan must
      be coordinated through the air traffic control agency currently in contact with the aircraft.
      7.1.7.3. Problems with flight plans (i.e., route of flight, missing data) and air traffic flow
      management messaging will be handled by calling the affected flying squadron and
      coordinating with the on-duty operations officer to correct the problem. The on-duty
      operations officer shall be responsible for correcting or re-filing the flight plan for the
      aircrew to prevent mission delay.
   7.1.8. Electronic flight plan filing:
      7.1.8.1. Configure computers by downloading and following instructions posted on the
      Form.
      7.1.8.2. Electronic flight plan and air traffic flow management messaging: Check FLIP
      Area Planning AP/2 and download instructions from the Form.
7.2. Slot Times and Flow Control.
   7.2.1. The two terms, slot time and flow control, are not controlled by AMD or the US
   government, but are flight restrictions imposed and controlled by several European air traffic
   control organizations.
60                                               RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009


        7.2.1.1. Flow control means that at a certain point or region (i.e., flight information
        region boundary), ATC authorities can and/or will only handle a certain number of
        aircraft per hour.
        7.2.1.2. Slot time, or calculated takeoff time (CTOT) is a 15-minute window, during
        which an aircraft can depart. Slot time is issued to Ramstein from Eurocontrol through
        GDSS2, and then passed to aircraft.
        7.2.1.3. To comply with European flow control restrictions, tower controllers will not
        issue clearances allowing aircraft to depart more than 5 minutes before or 10 minutes
        after an assigned CTOT. NOTE: CTOTs are displayed in the GDSS2. Ground control
        will ensure aircrews have the correct slot time on initial contact. AMD cannot request
        slot times--they can only delay, send "ready messages" or cancel the flight plan. It is
        important to note that sending a ready message does not always mean the aircraft will get
        a better slot time. Departure will be slot time -5/+10 minutes.
     7.2.2. Flow control exempt flights. Flow control exemption shall be in accordance with
     FLIP Area Planning AP/2, Theater Supplementary Notices and Procedures.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            61

8.5. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures. IAW DoD Flight Information Publication
Enroute Supplement, Ramstein airfield is official business only. Aircraft not assigned to
Ramstein AB or on a 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center controlled mission must submit a PPR
request to AM. Send PPR request no earlier than 15 days prior and no later than 24 hours prior
to arrival. IAW AFI 13-213; AFI 13-213 USAFE Supplement; AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft
Landing Permits; AFI 10-1801, Foreign Governmental Aircraft Landings at United States Air
Force Installations and this instruction, the Airfield Manager is the delegated approval authority
for all landing approvals and PPR authorizations.
8.6. Arriving Air Evac Notification and Response Procedures. The fire department is
designated as the agency responsible for rescue protection (aeromedical evacuation flights) upon
pilot notification. Upon request by the fire department, tower will:
   8.6.1. Notify fire department of the inbound aeromedical aircraft landing at Ramstein when
   the aircraft is 15 miles final or enters class D airspace VFR.
   8.6.2. Relay any additional information requested by the pilot to AM.
8.7. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals.
   8.7.1. Other than cases of in-flight emergency or weather divert, aircraft that are not
   scheduled to arrive at Ramstein AB will not receive landing clearance from the ATC tower.
   Any uncertainty regarding authorization to land on Ramstein AB must be resolved with AM
   prior to requesting landing clearance.

   and higher movements.
   8.8.2. ATC will notify the 86 AW/CP when DV-6 or higher is 25 miles from touchdown.
   8.8.3. Block-time updates. All departing DV aircraft must pass an initial block-time forecast
   as soon as safety permits after takeoff/climb out. A high frequency or satellite
   communications phone patch to 86 AW/CP will suffice on most missions.
   8.8.4. Block-time updates. Crews should plan to make their block time estimate. When
   unforeseen winds, ATC restrictions, fuel considerations, or any safety factor makes the
   original prediction unobtainable, make every effort to relay updated times to 86 AW/CP.
64                                                RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009


        8.8.4.1. On missions greater than 4 hours, crews should pass an updated block-time 2
        hours prior, if the forecast time has changed more than 10 minutes. Further adjustments
        within 2 hours should be held to a minimum.
        8.8.4.2. Once within UHF range of 86 AW/CP, all DV missions will relay actual block-
        times. At this range, adjustments should normally only be made to inform command post
        of a delay. Once within 30 minutes of predicted block-times, crews should consider full
        approaches and other timing adjustments before calling in, up to a 10-minute early
        arrival.
8.9. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo.
     8.9.1. The hazardous/hot cargo area is the HCP (Ramp 8). Ramp 5 can be used to park aircraft
     carrying certain amounts of hot cargo (see table 8.2). Servicing (up or downloading) of
     munitions loads may occur on Ramp 5, but must be limited to the amounts listed in table 8.2.
     If the amount of munitions exceeds authorized limits, aircraft must be moved to the HCP to
     service munitions.
     8.9.2. Hot cargo inbound notification. TA will notify the control tower of all AMC aircraft
     with hot cargo needing the HCP.
     8.9.3. If the pilot of an explosives-loaded aircraft or a hazardous cargo aircraft declares an
     in-flight emergency and requires landing at Ramstein AB, the following actions shall be
     accomplished.
        8.9.3.1. Ramstein tower shall activate PCAS and relay all information received from the
        pilot.
        8.9.3.2. Upon landing, aircraft will be directed to the hazardous cargo area and
        marshaled into position.
        8.9.3.3. If command post receives notification (by means other than the PCAS) of an in-
        flight emergency involving an explosives-loaded aircraft or a cargo aircraft with
        hazardous cargo aboard, they shall relay all information to tower. Tower will then
        activate the PCAS.
     8.9.4. The 86 AW/CP is the designated focal point for information and facilitates
     coordination of support efforts concerning hazardous munitions/cargo IAW 86 AW OPLAN
     11-204, Hazardous Munitions Cargo Plan.
     8.9.5. Explosive loaded cargo aircraft. The following limitations apply to routine, peacetime
     explosive loaded cargo aircraft operations. Table 8.2 illustrates approved explosive loaded
     aircraft cargo operations locations/limitations at Ramstein AB.

        8.9.5.1. Maximum amount of explosives that can ever be on the HCP at one time is
        65,136 pounds net explosives weight (NEW) of HC/D 1.1, utilizing only Spots 01 and 04
        at their maximum of 15,000 and 50,136 pounds NEW of HC/D 1.1 respectively.
        8.9.5.2. No more than 3 aircraft can be on the HCP at one time, which equates to a
        maximum of 45,000 pounds of explosives (15,000 pounds NEW of HC/D 1.1 per aircraft
        parked at Spots 01, 03 and 04).
        8.9.5.3. For aircraft parking on Ramp 5; identify aircraft loaded with munitions by
        posting symbols at each aircraft. One fire symbol may be posted at the point of entry for
        fire-fighting personnel to aircraft area; post the fire symbol for the highest class/division
        located within the aircraft area. Notify the Fire Alarm Communication Center (FACC)
        when each aircraft is loaded or unloaded. Give the aircraft tail number, parking location,
        and the type of explosives involved.
8.10. Wear of Hats and Reflective Belts. IAW AFI 21-101, Ramstein Supplement (paragraph
18.23.2.12.1.), all flight line areas are designated no-hat areas. These areas are inside the fence line of
the northeast, southeast, and southwest areas, all ramps, taxiways, and end-of-runway areas.
    8.10.1. Exceptions.

        authorized to be worn in no-hat areas. However, remain alert to operating engines.
        8.10.1.2. Security forces personnel, while performing official duties, may wear the beret with
        insignia attached; however, when they are within 50 feet of an operating aircraft their berets
        must be removed and secured.
    8.10.2. During inclement weather, darkness or periods of reduced visibility all personnel
    working/operating on the flight line are required to wear a reflective belt. Security forces
    personnel armed to provide security on the flight line are exempt from this requirement.

            AND SQUAWKING 7600, TURN NORTH TO ENTER THE VFR PATTERN AND
            LOOK FOR LIGHT GUN SIGNALS. NOTE: When the alternate tower is in use,
            aircraft will not be able to observe light signals until turning final approach.
            8.12.1.2.2. IMC: IF NOT ESTABLISHED ON A PUBLISHED APPROACH,
            MAINTAIN AT LEAST 5000 AND PROCEED DIRECT FRANK/MAPIG
            (DEPENDENT UPON RWY IN USE). IF ALIGNED FOR AN APPROACH, FLY
            APPROACH AS PUBLISHED.                  OTHERWISE, EXECUTE ONE TURN IN
            HOLDING FOR ALIGNMENT, AND FLY APPROACH AS PUBLISHED.
            SQUAWK 7600. MONITOR TOWER FOR LIGHT GUN SIGNALS. NOTE: When
            the alternate tower is in use, aircraft will not be able to observe light signals until
            approximately 4 NM final.
8.13. Standard Climb-out Instructions. Only local aircraft are authorized to use abbreviated
IFR climb out instructions, listed in paragraph 4.5. All transient aircraft must receive ATC
instructions for departures into the local IFR pattern or utilize the published departure procedure
instructed by ATC. All VFR aircraft will be given departure instructions by ATC. NOTE:
Transient aircraft shall not be issued local ATC instructions for departures into the IFR pattern as
a ―work-around‖ for specified climb gradients published in the departure procedures.
8.14. Opposite Direction Take-Offs and Landings.
     8.14.1. Opposite direction IFR cutoff points.
        8.14.1.1. Opposite direction IFR arrival vs. IFR arrival to the runway. No two IFR aircraft
        will be simultaneously inbound inside 10 miles on opposite final approach courses. An
        aircraft conducting an opposite direction approach terminating in a circling maneuver to the
        active runway ceases to be an opposite direction approach once the aircraft turns base to the
        active runway.
        8.14.1.2. Opposite direction IFR arrival vs. IFR departure/low approach, etc. from the
        runway in use. An opposite direction IFR arrival shall not proceed inbound closer than 10
        NM from the departure end of the runway in use until the IFR departure/low approach is
        airborne and established on a course diverging by at least 15 degrees from the reciprocal
        of the final approach course before an IFR arriving aircraft reaches 10 NM on final.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                   67


   8.14.2. IFR opposite direction departure vs. IFR arrival to the runway in use. An opposite
   direction IFR departure must be airborne and established on a course diverging by at least 15
   degrees from the reciprocal of the final approach course before an IFR arriving aircraft can
   proceed inbound past 10 NM final.
   8.14.3. VFR opposite direction criteria. Opposite direction separation standards listed in the
   previous three paragraphs may be reduced to 6 NM when either or both aircraft are VFR.
   VFR aircraft in the pattern will not turn base leg until an opposite direction departure is
   airborne and clear of the final approach course or an opposite direction arrival has landed.
   8.14.4. Control tower and GCA shall follow the coordination procedures in the control
   tower/GCA Coordination Procedures Operations Letter.
8.15. Breakout/Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures. Refer to paragraph 4.7. for
breakout/go around/missed approach procedures.
8.16. Flight line Smoking Policy. According to Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
Standard 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line – Ground Operations and Activities and National Fire
Protection Association, National Fire Code 410, smoking is prohibited on the flight line and
ramp areas. This prohibition applies to the entire ramp area, not just the restricted areas inside the
red lines.
8.17. Civilian Aircraft Operations. Civil aircraft (except US/AMC charter), other than
emergencies, will not be allowed to land unless an approved civil aircraft landing permit
number/aircraft landing authorization number is on file and verified at AM. Upon verification
from AM, a PPR number will be issued to allow for landing/parking at Ramstein AB.
8.18. Civil Use of Military NAVAIDS. Civil aircraft without prior-permission-required (PPR)
approval may use USAF navigational aids and radar services, as long as operations will not
conflict with local traffic.
8.19. Aero Club Operations. Ramstein AB does not have an Aero Club.
8.20. Hazardous/Severe Weather Notification Procedures/Lightning Response.
   8.20.1. Lightning watch. This watch is in effect 30 minutes prior to thunderstorms being within
   5 NM radius of the base. Operations or activities may continue; however, all personnel must be
   prepared to implement lightning warning procedures.
   8.20.2. Lightning warning. This warning is in effect whenever lightning occurs within a 5 NM
   radius of the base.
       8.20.2.1. IAW AFOSH 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line – Ground Operations and Activities,
       personnel in affected locations cease all outside activities and seek shelter. Approved shelters
       include:

        8.20.2.2. Aircraft with engines running may continue if their specific mission design series
        regulations allow taxi and takeoff, avoiding all thunderstorms, down drafts or rain shafts.
        This is with ATC concurrence and slot time approval. Aircraft may also wait in parking with
        crew and passengers aboard (this applies to arriving aircraft as well). Realize this may be an
        extended wait since transportation may not be able to send out a bus to pick-up personnel.
        Do not taxi into or out of parking slots that require marshallers when none are present.
        Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) equipment will be shutdown during lightning
        warnings.
8.21. Airfield Snow Removal Operations.
     8.21.1. AM is the central coordinating agency for snow removal and ice control on the
     airfield. Requests for snow removal/ice control will be handled according to established
     priorities in Consolidated 86th Airlift Wing/435th Air Base Wing Snow and Ice Control
     Plan 86-05.
        8.21.1.1. Airfield, runway and taxiway snow removal priorities will be in accordance
        with 86 AW OPLAN 86-05.
        8.21.1.2. Snow removal from NAVAIDs will be IAW 86 AW OPLAN 86-05.
     8.21.2. AM /snow control will advise tower and GCA when anti-icing agent is applied to the
     runway.
     8.21.3. Tower will broadcast and initiate an advisory on the ATIS which states
     "CLEARWAY ON RUNWAY". This advisory will remain on the ATIS for 3 hours after
     application, or until AM advises clearway has dissipated. Tower will advise departing
     turbojet aircraft of the possibility of smoke on takeoff when chemicals have been applied to
     the runway.
8.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program Guidelines.
     8.22.1. AM and/or control tower personnel will determine and report the bird watch
     condition (BWC).
     8.22.2. Bird watch conditions (BWC) are based on observations made by aircrews, tower,
     AM, GCA observed and tower confirmed, and game wardens.
     8.22.3. Tower will:

        8.22.4.2. Notify 86 AW/CP and 723 AMS/AMCC of BWC changes.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            69


      8.22.4.3. Will notify tower, AMCC, 86 AW/CP, 86 OSS/OSW and 86 AW/SEF when
      BWC changes to/from MODERATE and SEVERE.
   8.22.5. Additional information and guidance can be found in 86 AW OPLAN 91-212.
8.23. Bird Watch Condition (BWC).
   8.23.1. LOW: Normal bird activities on and above the airfield with a low probability of
   hazard.
   8.23.2. MODERATE: Increased bird population in the terminal area which presents an
   increased potential for strike.
   8.23.3. SEVERE: High bird population on or immediately above the active runway or other
   specific location that presents a high potential for strike.
   8.23.4. BWC restrictions:
      8.23.4.1. LOW: No restrictions during this condition..
      8.23.4.2. MODERATE: Local training flights must be approved by the 86 OG/CC or
      designated representative. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies and
      supervisors and caution by aircrews.
      8.23.4.3. SEVERE: All arrivals and departures will be delayed until the bird condition is
      reduced. Minimum fuel or emergency aircraft will be permitted to conduct straight-in,
      full stop landings only, and will be at the discretion of the pilot-in-command. Departure
      of any aircraft must be approved by the 86 OG/CC or designated representative.
      Supervisors and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before conducting
      operations in areas under condition SEVERE.
8.24. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operating from the Tower. Ramstein AB does not have a
SOF program.
8.25. Taking of Photographs. Photography on and around the airfield is restricted by RABI
31-101 Chapter 15. Contact 86 AW/PA (Public Affairs) for questions regarding photography on
the airfield.
8.26. Exercise Procedures.
   8.26.1. Exercise coordination. In accordance with AFI 13-203, paragraph 8.1; base
   officials must brief the airfield operations flight commander (AOF/CC) at least 48 hours
   in advance, of exercises that involve any ATC facility or the airport movement area. In
   this case, the AOF/CC is considered a trusted agent. IAW with AFI 13-213, the airfield
   manager must also be involved in any pre-exercise coordination and will also be
   considered a trusted agent.
   8.26.2. Exercise aircraft. Ramstein GCA will, time and traffic permitting, notify tower
   and 86 AW/CP when fast moving, predesignated aggressor aircraft announce their
   intention to perform an airfield attack during local exercises. If tower receives initial
   notification by a predesignated aggressor, they will notify GCA and the 86 AW/CP, time
   and traffic permitting.
70                                                 RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009


        8.26.2.1. Exercise aircraft will be advised by Ramstein GCA or tower of the NATO
        alarm condition upon initial contact. When advised of condition alarm red, aircraft will
        state their intentions in accordance with applicable war plans and simulations.
        8.26.2.2. Exercise aircraft will depart and recover IFR, unless otherwise approved by the
        86 OG/CC or designated representative.
8.27. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Proficiency Range. The following general
procedures will be used:
     8.27.1. Location. SW area at building 2271.
     8.27.2. Tower will be notified of the number of detonations, use of smoke grenades, when
     the detonations will occur, when each detonation or series of detonations is complete and
     when EOD has terminated range operations for the day.
     8.27.3. Initial tower notification of planned/emergency operations will be made via landline.
     EOD will request tower to monitor fire/crash net. Prior to any detonation, EOD will contact
     tower via LMR on fire/crash net and request vertical clearance, inform of number of
     detonations, and time occurring. Upon termination, EOD will notify tower of completion of
     operations.
8.28. Silent Launch Operations (SLO).
     8.28.1. These procedures apply to locally assigned 86 AW aircraft and require GCA to be
     operational for IFR operations. Normal Ramstein GCA operating hours are 0600L - 2200L
     daily. The objective is to safely launch unit aircraft without radio communications to
     minimize operational detection.
     8.28.2. SLO and all related documentation will be maintained by 86 OSS/OSK (Wing
     Tactics).
     8.28.3. Safety should be emphasized during all phases of SLO and additional measure taken
     to mitigate unnecessary risks. ATC and/or aircrews will break communication silence if
     there is any safety concern/risk. SLO will be terminated any time safety is jeopardized or
     circumstances dictate; for example, if weather, clearance or maintenance problems cannot be
     resolved. Any radio transmissions from participating aircraft or radio calls directed to
     participating aircraft for these reasons will signal termination of silent operations. Do not
     make reference to SLO on any radio. Once terminated, SLO will not be resumed.
     8.28.4. Weather minimums for SLO are 1000/ft ceiling and 1 mile visibility. SLO will be
     terminated any time the weather drops below these minima. If a Tactical VFR Sortie is
     flown in conjunction with a Silent Launch, the weather minima for Tactical VFR Sorties
     apply.
     8.28.5. The aircraft commander (AC) or designated representative will receive an updated
     "time hack" with Ramstein Tower Net 12 hours prior to departure at DSN: 478-7438. The
     AC will ensure all crewmembers have acquired an accurate "time hack" prior to stepping to
     the aircraft.
     8.28.6. The AC should notify ATC a minimum of 12 hours prior to takeoff of intention to
     utilize Silent Launch/Recovery procedures. This notification must be made NLT 1+00 prior
     to departure via secure means using the format in Attachment 12.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                               71


  8.28.7. Light gun procedures will be in effect during all phases of aircraft movement. Crews
  will utilize the AFVA 13-221, Control Tower Light Signal Card, 1 November 2001.
  8.28.8. Aircrews will tune and monitor (VHF 121.5 and/or UHF 243.0) guard frequencies
  during all phases of SLO. Aircrews will monitor ground frequency (VHF - 121.775 or UHF
  - 308.775) during all engine start and taxi operations until reaching the hold short line for all
  runways. Crews will full stop at the hold short line at which time they will switch on their
  own to and monitor tower frequency.
  8.28.9. IFR silent recoveries and landings will not be performed.
  8.28.10. SLO will not be used to reposition aircraft.
  8.28.11. 86 AW aircrews must be fully qualified.
  8.28.12. 86 AW aircrews will not conduct SLO in conjunction with aircrew ancillary
  training and/or during simulated or real EP‘s.
  8.28.13. Engine Start Sequence.
     8.28.13.1. When SLO procedures are in effect, 86 AW aircraft besides C-130s are
     cleared to start engines 25 minutes prior to scheduled departure (30 minutes with a GTC).
     Proper clearing authorities/safety personnel and equipment will be utilized.
     8.28.13.2. When SLO procedures are in effect, C-130s are cleared to start engines 40
     minutes prior to scheduled departure while parked on Ramps 1, 2, and 3 using the 2-1-1
     procedure. Proper clearing authorities/safety personnel and equipment will be utilized.
  8.28.14. Aircraft Clearance.
     8.28.14.1. If the SLO aircraft is scheduled to be handed off to Langen RADAR, tower
     will request IFR clearance when visual contact has been made with the SLO aircraft
     approaching the VFR hold short line. Tower will inform Langen ACC the SLO aircraft
     will delay for one IFR pattern. This procedure will be the standard operation.
     8.28.14.2. Crews may request IFR departure clearance relay via secure means (Iridium,
     STE III, etc). This request must be passed via the launch officer and pre-coordinated
     using timing flow plan worksheet (Attachment 12). See paragraph 8.28.17. for
     exception.
     8.28.14.3. If the SLO aircraft will remain in the Ramstein local VFR pattern, ―WISKY-
     PIVOT-ECHO‖ (vice versa for Rwy 08) will be the standard climb-out. Upon passing
     PIVOT, crews will break silence and comply with paragraph 8.28.18.3.1.
     8.28.14.4. If the SLO aircraft encounter actual lost communication, comply with
     paragraph 8.12. and appropriate FLIP guidance.
  8.28.15. Taxi Operations
     8.28.15.1. Under no circumstances will SLO aircraft be allowed onto Rwy 27/09 unless
     to cross for Rwy 26 at Twy Bravo.
     8.28.15.2. Aircraft will hold short at all appropriate hold short lines and await light gun
     signals.
72                                             RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009


     8.28.15.3. SLO aircraft must be parked on the same parking ramp if in a formation (C-
     130 only). Mission Commanders must be aware that the timing flow plan becomes
     extremely important under radio silence when you cannot visually monitor your
     wingman.
     8.28.15.4. Southwest Area (SWA) Procedures.
        8.28.15.4.1. Applicable to 76 AS aircraft only.
        8.28.15.4.2. Tower will ensure that Twy Golf south of Rwy 26 is clear of aircraft
        NLT 20 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. After the taxi operation is
        initiated, the AC will have ultimate responsibility for clearing until visual with the
        tower. Aircrews must use extra vigilance for utility vehicles (snow plows, tugs, etc)
        that are not communicating with ATC and taxiing aircraft. Breaking radio silence is
        required if a safety situation arises.
        8.28.15.4.3. Upon reaching the hold-short line for Twy Golf south of Rwy 26, the
        aircraft will come to a complete full stop. Tower will inform the aircraft via light gun
        procedures the following (after departure clearance is received):
            8.28.15.4.3.1. Rwy 26 Operations – A flashing green light will enable the aircraft
            to position and hold for Rwy 08, cleared to proceed with 15-30 second engine run
            at takeoff rated thrust, power to idle, release brakes, and taxi into position an hold
            Rwy 26. Aircraft Commanders will ensure that taxi speed will be less than 45
            knots groundspeed (nose-wheel steering max speed).
            8.28.15.4.3.2. Rwy 08 Operations - A flashing green light will enable the aircraft
            to position and hold for Rwy 08, proceed with 15-30 second engine run at Takeoff
            Rated Thrust if crew desires.
     8.28.15.5. Ramp 1 Procedures
        8.28.15.5.1. Tower will ensure that Twy Delta east of Ramp 2 to Twy Bravo is clear
        of aircraft NLT 20 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. Aircrews must use
        extra vigilance for utility vehicles (snow plows, tugs, etc) that are not communicating
        with ATC and taxiing aircraft. Breaking radio silence is expected if a safety situation
        arises.
        8.28.15.5.2. SLO aircraft operating from Ramp 1 are automatically cleared to taxi
        based upon the fragged taxi time using Attachment 12. These aircraft will taxi and
        hold short at the intersection of Ramp 1 and Twy Delta, until visual confirmation of
        light gun signals with tower.
     8.28.15.6. Ramp 2 Procedures. Tower will ensure that Twy Delta East of Mitchell Ave.
     to Twy Bravo is clear of aircraft NLT 20 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time.
     Aircrews must use extra vigilance for utility vehicles (snow plows, tugs, etc) that are not
     communicating with ATC and taxiing aircraft.
     8.28.15.7. Ramp 3 Procedures. ATC facilities will ensure that Twy Delta to Twy Bravo
     is clear NLT 20 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. Aircrews must use extra
     vigilance for utility vehicles (snow plows, tugs, etc) that are not communicating with
     ATC and taxiing aircraft.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           73


     8.28.15.8. Under no circumstances will SLO aircraft initiate taxi from Ramps 2 and 3
     without proper light-gun signals unless specifically cleared to do so by means of Iridium
     communication, or pre-coordination efforts (i.e. timing) with launch officer and ATC.
     8.28.15.9. Crews, Launch officer, and Tower personnel must be extra vigilant during
     periods where visual confirmation (light gun) with the tower is obstructed (ILS Hold
     Short Line at Bravo, Ramp 1, Twy Delta – Twy Bravo Ops, etc). See paragraph 8.28.3.
  8.28.16. Aircraft Lighting. SLO aircraft will maintain aircraft lighting IAW AFI 11-202V3,
  AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and respective flight
  manual(s).
  8.28.17. IFR Local Climbout Procedures (Silent).
     8.28.17.1. Aircraft departing IFR will squawk 4237.
         8.28.17.1.1. The use of ―LOCAL CLIMBOUT‖ phraseology constitutes an
         abbreviated IFR clearance for locally assigned aircraft that are transitioning from
         tower to the GCA RADAR pattern. This clearance will be the SOP for all IFR
         departing SLO aircraft.
         8.28.17.1.2. Rwy 08 Local Climbout 360 Track. See paragraph 4.5.1.2
         8.28.17.1.3. Rwy 26 Local Climbout 050 Track. See paragraph 4.5.1.4.
     8.28.17.2. Upon passing 3000‘ MSL, SLO aircraft will break radio silence and contact
     GCA VHF– 140.900 or UHF – 356.225, acknowledge position (Radial-DME) from RMS
     TACAN.
     8.28.17.3. GCA will RADAR identify the SLO aircraft, provide RADAR vectors and
     IFR clearance as appropriate.
     8.28.17.4. After IFR clearance is received and squawk is transmitted, GCA will
     coordinate for IFR handoff to Langen ACC upon pilot request.
  8.28.18. VFR Local Climbout/Arrival Procedures (Silent).
     8.28.18.1. See CH 2, Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Procedures.
     8.28.18.2. Aircraft will squawk German VFR – 0033.
     8.28.18.3. After departure, crews will fly to points WISKY (291-R/6.6 DME), PIVOT
     (352-R/6.6 DME), and ECHO (062-R/5.2 DME), if departing Rwy 26 (opposite routing
     for Rwy 08 will apply). All radials and DME are from Ramstein‘s TACAN (RMS).
         8.28.18.3.1. Upon reaching PIVOT, crews will contact tower and report ―(call sign)
         PIVOT‖ (ex ―Hook 69, PIVOT‖). This will allow ATC the ability to deny arrival if a
         traffic conflict should occur.
         8.28.18.3.2. Should tower accept the SLO aircraft for arrival, tower will reply ―(call
         sign), REPORT GEAR‖
         8.28.18.3.3. If traffic does not permit, Tower will say ―(call sign) HOLD NORTH
         OF PIVOT‖. SLO aircraft will ―orbit‖ over PIVOT.
         8.28.18.3.4. When traffic allows, tower will follow up with ―(call sign) REPORT
         GEAR.‖
74                                                RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009


            8.28.18.3.5. Once tower has issued ―(call sign) REPORT GEAR‖, SLO operations
            are resumed and the aircraft can depart PIVOT for ECHO (or WISKY depending on
            Rwy) with no further radio communications.
        8.28.18.4. The standard arrival for SLO aircraft will be a 3 mile initial flown at 2500‘
        MSL, tactical overhead approach with a north break and look for light gun signals turning
        final.
     8.28.19. Landing.
        8.28.19.1. Under no circumstances shall the crew attempt landing on any runway without
        receiving permission from tower via light gun (STEADY GREEN), or if warranted,
        verbal communication. Tower will ensure that Rwy 26/08 is clear of all arriving and
        departing traffic, and that wake turbulence minimum times are observed.
            8.28.19.1.1. Should an aircraft receive a light gun signal other than steady green
            (cleared to land), the crew will accomplish go-around procedures IAW with
            applicable FLIP guidance, Technical Orders and paragraph 4.7 of this instruction and
            break SLO operations (ex. ―Hook 69 Going Around‖).
            8.28.19.1.2. Should a light gun signal be in question by the aircrew, the aircrew will
            perform the go-around procedures IAW with applicable FLIP, Technical Orders and
            paragraph 4.7 of this instruction.
            8.28.19.1.3. Should it become apparent that a light gun signal was displayed
            incorrectly, tower will break SLO operations and verbalize instructions to the SLO
            aircraft accordingly. Aircraft will comply with tower‘s instructions.
        8.28.19.2. SLO aircraft will break radio silence prior to crossing the Rwy threshold with
        ―GEAR DOWN‖ call.
     8.28.20. Taskings.

RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            77


   8.28.21. Post Mission
       8.28.21.1. Mission commanders and launch officers will complete post mission silent
       launch feedback and forward it to wing tactics NLT 24 hours after mission completion.
       8.28.21.2. Wing tactics will maintain post mission silent launch feedbacks for 6 months.
8.29. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations.
   8.29.1. C Co 1-214th Aviation Regiment helicopter NVG operations within Ramstein Air
   Base Class D Airspace will be conducted IAW procedures defined in the Letter of
   Agreement located in the Airfield Operations Flight file plan.
   8.29.2. The 37th Airlift Squadron NVG operations will be conducted IAW Operations Letter
   between 86 OSS and 37 AS.
8.30. Simulated Flameout Approaches (SFO). SFO approaches are not authorized at
Ramstein.
8.31. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA).
   8.31.1. ARA procedures are special-use procedures for use by 86 AW aircraft only. Other
   aircraft and DoD components may use these procedures only after receiving approval from
   USAFE A3 IAW AFI 11-203.
   8.31.2. NGA and USAFE-approved ARAs can be flown in both IMC and VMC conditions.
   8.31.3. Runway 26.      Aircrews conducting a straight-in ARA will not need to request
   approval for the approach from GCA when VMC. When IMC, GCA will issue clearance to
   conduct the approach and approval for own navigation for the ARA procedure.
   8.31.4. Runway 08. Due to the proximity of Baumholder Range and air traffic separation
   requirements from restricted airspace, clearance for self-navigation to conduct ARA
   procedures will not be issued until aircraft is at least on base leg heading south.
   8.31.5. Runway 09/27 ARA approaches are not authorized.
8.32. Flightline Hearing Protection. It is very important that personnel are adequately
protected when working in hazardous noise environments. The Air Force does not have specific
guidance or policy addressing the level of hearing protection required when operating around
active aircraft. The Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) Flight conducted a review of
hazardous noise level exposures encountered when working around active aircraft.
   8.32.1. Personnel are required to wear double hearing protection when working within 100
   feet of active aircraft on the flightline. An active aircraft is any aircraft with an engine
   running, such as during Engine Running Onload (ERO), or any aircraft with an Auxiliary
   Power Unit (APU) or Gas Turbine Compressor (GTC) operating.
   8.32.2. Personnel should review their most recent Industrial Hygiene survey, performed by
   BEE, for hearing protection requirements when working with hazardous noise producing
   equipment.

                     LOW VISIBILITY RAMP/APRON PROCEDURES

9.1. Low Visibility RAMP/APRON Operations. Defined as operations conducted on the
airfield where the RVR is at or below 400 m and include four distinct low visibility conditions
(VISCONs) defined below.
     9.1.1. Weather will notify AM when changes in weather create changes in low visibility
     conditions. AM, in turn, will report changes in low visibility conditions via the secondary
     crash net.
     9.1.2. Ramp controllers (as described in paragraph 1.7.) shall establish one central point of
     contact and control for their respective ramps.
9.2. VISCON 1. VISCON 1 will be in effect when the RVR is between 200 m and 400 m,
inclusive. While in VISCON 1, all operators on the airfield will wear reflective gear and all
drivers will turn on vehicle headlights and flashing lights. NOTE: CMA restrictions in
paragraph 6.8 apply to all vehicles and personnel.
9.3. VISCON 2. VISCON 2 will be in effect when the RVR is greater than or equal to 100 m
and less than 200 m. In addition to the provisions of para 9.2:
     9.3.1. Ramp central points of contact will establish two-way communications with the ATC
     tower via the digital ramp net (using the authorized call signs listed in Table 6.1).
     9.3.2. Ramp controllers and operators will take inventory of all personnel and equipment on
     the ramp.
     9.3.3. Taxi operations. Only aircraft arrivals will be allowed to taxi. Exception, for 86 AW
     aircraft, refer to paragraph 1.21.1.3.
     9.3.4. Vehicles will not exceed 10 mph while operating on the airfield.
9.4. VISCON 3. VISCON 3 will be in effect when the RVR is greater than or equal to 50 m
and less than 100 m. In addition to the provisions of paragraphs 9.2 – 9.3.4:
     9.4.1. Vehicle operations. Only mission critical vehicles are authorized to operate on the
     airfield and must activate flashing/hazard lights at all times when on the airfield even if
     temporarily parked. IAW AFOSH 91-100, refueling and explosive loaded (laden) vehicles
     will not be operated on the airfield.
     9.4.2. As soon as possible, the central point of contact for each ramp will report 100%
     accountability of personnel, vehicles and equipment operating on the ramp to ATC tower via
     the digital ramp net. Tower will not issue taxi clearances until each ramp has reported 100%
     accountability.
     9.4.3. Taxi operations. Only aircraft arrivals will be allowed to taxi. Exception, for 86 AW
     aircraft, refer to paragraph 1.21.1.3. Prior to an aircraft taxiing, the ATC tower will inform
     each ramp central point of contact in the path of the aircraft for personnel and equipment
     dispersal. NOTE: Aircraft will not be given taxi clearance from ATC until each ramp
     point of contact in the projected path of the aircraft has ensured and reported the taxi
     route is free of personnel and equipment.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           79

   improves to VISCON 3 or better. Only movement to clear the path for taxiing aircraft or in
   support of emergencies is authorized.
   9.5.3. All aircraft engine runs will cease.
   9.5.4. Taxi operations. Only aircraft arrivals will be allowed to taxi. Prior to an aircraft
   taxiing to parking, the ATC tower will inform each ramp central point of contact in the path
   of the aircraft for personnel and equipment dispersal. NOTE: Aircraft will not be given
   taxi clearance from ATC until each ramp point of contact in the projected path of the
   aircraft has ensured and reported the taxi route is free of personnel and equipment.
   9.5.5. Due to the limitations associated with RVR reporting, 86 OG/CC approval must be
   obtained to deviate from established procedures. Exception, 86 MXG/CC may approve
   deviations from chapter 9 procedures for 86 MXG personnel operating on Ramps 1, 2 and 7;
   723 AMS/CC may approve deviations for 723 AMS personnel operating on Ramps 5 and 8.

visual range not less than 550 m.
Category II (CAT II) operation—.A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision
height lower than 60 m (200 ft), but not lower than 30 m (100 ft), and a runway visual range not
less than 350 m.
Category IIIa (CAT IIIa) operation.—A precision instrument approach and landing with:
a) a decision height lower than 30 m (100 ft) or no decision height; and
b) a runway visual range not less than 200 m.
All—Weather Operations.Any taxi, take-off or landing operations in conditions where visual
reference is limited by weather conditions.
ILS critical area—An area of defined dimensions about the localizer and glide path antennas
where vehicles, including aircraft, are excluded during all ILS operations. The critical area is
protected because the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside its boundaries will cause
unacceptable disturbance to the ILS signal in-space.
ILS sensitive area.—An area extending beyond the critical area where the parking and/or
movement of vehicles, including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable
interference to the ILS signal during ILS operations. The sensitive area is protected to provide
normally within the airfield boundary.

         AIRCRAFT ARRESTING BARRIER ENGAGEMENT PROCEDURES

Table A9.1. Barrier Engagement Procedures.

INITIAL RESPONSE AND ASSEMBLY

This will be dictated by the type of barrier engagement.

Fire Department vehicles will be positioned at designated locations along the runway
according to the established response plan.

Barrier maintenance will report to the applicable aircraft arresting system. After normal
duty hours, barrier-qualified fire department personnel, if available, will report to the
aircraft arresting system.

The following agencies will assemble at the intersection of the road leading past Airfield
Management and the north crash access road.
Crash recovery
Ambulance
Airfield Management will position for immediate runway access.
TA will respond for fighter aircraft.

RUNWAY OPERATIONS SUSPENDED

When the aircraft has engaged the barrier, Airfield Management will notify Tower over
the ramp net that runway ops are suspended.

Airfield Management will notify 86 AW/CP and take appropriate NOTAM action.

Traffic and workload permitting, Tower will broadcast on guard frequency that ops are
suspended and the estimated time they will resume.

RUNWAY RESPONSE

Fire department and crash recovery vehicles will respond to the aircraft upon clearance
from the Tower.

Barrier maintenance will report to the pits. After normal duty hours and on weekends,
qualified fire department personnel will report to the barrier pit area.

Airfield Management will obtain clearance from the Tower and inspect the runway for
debris.

All other agencies will respond to the aircraft only at the direction of the incident
response commander.
RAMSTEINABI13-203 6 NOVEMBER 2009                                                              97


The fire department official in command will ensure the aircraft is fire-safe and advise the
Tower of assistance requirements. The Tower will relay the requirement to the Airfield
Management representative. Vehicles not requested will remain at the assembly point.

The aircraft commander and the 86 OG/CC will determine if the aircraft is capable of
self extraction based on aircraft type and mechanical state.

AIRCRAFT EXTRACTION

Hand signals will be used by fire protection and crash recovery personnel.

Fire Department and/or Crash Recovery personnel will remove the aircraft from the
barrier cable and contact 786 CES service call for standby response to put the arresting
system back in service.

If the aircraft is damaged or disabled, routine priority will normally be used to remove
it.

If emergency (30 minutes) or urgent (1+30) priority criteria are to be used, the final
decision will be made by the 86 OG/CC.

NOTE: If prior to the engagement the aircraft commander notifies the tower with intentions
to shut down or determines the situation will warrant shutdown, fire department and crash
recovery may proceed onto the runway after receiving clearance from the tower.

RESUMING RUNWAY OPERATIONS

As the barrier engagement extraction progresses, the incident response commander will
pass estimates to the tower of how long it will take to resume runway ops.

Tower will advise GCA of the anticipated opening time. Tower will advise the incident
response commander of any impending emergencies while the engagement clearance is
in progress.

As the aircraft is being removed (either by taxi or tow), the Airfield Management
representative will check the runway for debris and call the sweeper if necessary.

Power Production standby personnel will perform the post-engagement inspection and
notify Airfield Management/Control Tower when the system is operational. When all
vehicles are off the runway, the barrier tape rewound, and the runway clear, the Airfield
Management representative will notify AM Operations and Tower when runway ops can
be resumed. Only Power Production/Barrier Maintenance can return the system to
operational status, if they are not available the system will not, under any circumstance,
be returned to service. Emergency aircraft will be directed to remaining serviceable
arresting system. AM Ops will then notify the 86 AW/CP and take the appropriate
NOTAM action.
