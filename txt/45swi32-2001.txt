                                      GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Program Objective. A successful fire prevention program requires command support at all levels
and the continuing efforts of all 45 SW personnel. The effects of fire have a direct impact on the ability of
the 45 SW and all assigned organizations to accomplish the mission.

1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all personnel, organizations and activities within the 45
SW or tenant units, including active duty personnel, contractors, concessionaires, military family housing
occupants and any other person/s while on property controlled by the 45 SW.
   1.2.1. Where applicable and to the extent possible this instruction shall apply to Patrick Air Force
   Base (PAFB), Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Antigua Air Station, Ascension Auxiliary
   Field, Jonathan Dickenson Missle Tracking Annex, Malabar Tracking Annex and all other sites under
   the jurisdiction of the 45 SW, unless otherwise directed in the contract statement of work.
   1.2.2. This instruction is not intended to supersede any legally mandated or contractual requirements.
   1.2.3. Adherence to established fire prevention practices is the responsibility of all personnel who
   work for, or are associated with the 45 SW.
   1.2.4. This instruction has been developed to afford a minimum level of fire protection and life safety
   guidance to help insure the protection of Air Force personnel and property and the general public from
   the dangers posed by fire, hazardous materials and other potentially life threatening or injury causing
   situations/conditions and to minimize the effect of an incident/accident should it occur.
   1.2.5. It is the responsibility of all 45 SW personnel to conduct themselves in a manner which does
   not pose an unnecessary risk of fire or injury to themselves or others and to abide by the contents of
   this instruction.

1.3. Equivalencies and Alternatives.
   1.3.1. Nothing in this instruction is intended to prevent the use of systems, methods or devices of
   equivalent or superior quality, strength, fire resistance, effectiveness, durability, or safety.
   1.3.2. If a variance from an existing standard is required the requestor has the right to submit the
   request for variance to the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). The requestor must provide adequate
   documentation for the variance request plus any technical specifications or other documentation.
   Once the need is determined and the request package has been developed submit the request to the
   AHJ for review. The requestor must adequately demonstrate to the AHJ that the suggested alternative
   method meets or exceeds the intent of the minimum standard and that the alternative method, device
   or procedure is acceptable and safe.

1.4. Definitions.
   1.4.1. AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report. This is the initial document used by the Fire
   Department Fire Prevention Office to document either a fire safety deficiency or a fire hazard. This
   form should contain a minimum of three copies, one for the facility manager, one for the functional
   manager, and one for the fire prevention office.

                         CONTRACT MANAGEMENT/CONSTRUCTION

7.1. Construction Project Review. The Fire Department Fire Prevention Office takes an active and
aggressive interest in all aspects of construction/renovation projects, this includes AF Forms 332, Civil
Engineer Work Request, DD Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data, project book develop-
ment, design reviews, materials approval, actual construction and pre and final acceptance tests.

7.2. Pre-construction Meetings. The Fire Chief or designated representative will attend pre-construc-
tion and pre-performance meetings with the engineering contract manager to coordinate fire prevention
requirements. This includes appropriated and non-appropriated funded projects, MILCON projects, saber
projects, Army Corps of Engineering projects etc.

7.3. Fire Hazards, Unsafe Practices, and/or Conditions During Contruction. When fire hazards,
unsafe practices, or unsafe conditions are found during construction, the Civil Engineer contract monitor/
project manager shall take immediate corrective actions.

7.4. Contract Fire Prevention Construction Guidance. Each contract shall contain a specific section
on fire prevention that references the pertinent, applicable guidance for that particular project.

7.5. Project Coordination. All construction projects, renovation projects, demolition projects, or alter-
ations of any kind to 45 Space Wing real property facilities shall be coordinated with the PAFB/CCAFS
Fire Prevention Offices, Civil Engineering, Contract Engineering (or equivalent). This includes construc-
tion projects at PAFB, CCAFS, Antigua, Ascension, Jonathan Dickenson, Malabar and all other sites con-
trolled by the 45 SW.

7.6. Conflicting Guidance. If conflicting guidance for the same subject or issue exists, consult
MIL-HDBK-1008C for order or precedence.

7.7. Waiver or Variance Requests. A request for a waiver or variance to MIL-HDBK-1008C require-
ments may be submitted as specified in the first chapter of MIL-HDBK-1008C. Note: Cost savings is not
in and of itself a valid reason for requesting a waiver or variance.

7.8. Current Standards. The most current edition of an applicable standard available at the time of a
project’s design shall apply.

7.9. Use Group, Height, and Area Limitations. For determining things like use group, occupancy, con-
struction type, height and area limitations consult the uniform building code (UBC).

7.10. Egress and Life Safety Requirements. For determining egress and life safety requirements con-
sult NFPA 101 the Life Safety Code (LSC).

7.12. Minimum Fire Protection Requirements. Unless an automatic fire suppression is specifically
required by ETL, MIL-HDBK or NFPA, the minimum requirement for any new building on property
owned or controlled by the 45 SW is a complete automatic fire detection system and manual pull stations.
Smoke detectors in the HVAC ductwork and manual pull stations at the exits do not meet these minimum
requirements.
   7.12.1. If a system is required, coverage shall include 100%-of the facility. All spaces occupied or
   unoccupied, concealed or open shall be equally protected. The exemptions specified in
   MIL-HDBK-1008C and or applicable National Fire Code shall be honored. Some of the most notable
   and common exceptions for coverage for fire detection systems are small, concealed spaces less than
   50-square feet in area, concealed spaces above false ceilings less than 6-inches in height, the areas
   above false ceilings used as return air ducts, all spaces above false ceilings, in attics, near the roof, etc.
   Where smoke could accumulate in the event of a fire, areas shall be subdivided into less than
   3,000-square foot. The material used to sub-divide the smoke compartments shall have a minimum of
   a ½-hour, fire resistance rating.

7.13. Code Compliance for Renovations. When renovating a facility unless specifically required by
code, only the area being renovated must be brought up to the code requirements specified for new con-
struction.

7.14. Major Renovations. In accordance with AFCESA, NFPA, MIL-HDBK-1008C, the term “major
renovation” shall cause a facility to be considered new construction. The term “major renovation” has no
set cost or square footage value.
