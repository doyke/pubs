1. OVERVIEW
2                                                                     AFI14-135 22 May 2014


    1.1. The Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Enterprise Image Quality
    Verification Program (EIQVP). The ISR EIQVP provides the framework to establish and
    incorporate, as applicable, technical standards based on current industry "best practices"
    imaging and video benchmark quality standards for an end-to-end Image Quality (IQ)
    program, applicable to imaging sensors and their associated data processing, data
    transmission, and display systems throughout their programmed life cycle, and optimize IQ
    through the entire image chain. ISR EIQVP is a comprehensive program established to
    ensure consistent IQ is delivered from sensor to the imagery analyst.
    1.2. ISR EIQVP Applicability. This publication applies to traditional airborne ISR
    platforms; this includes, but is not limited to imaging sensors on: U-2, RQ-4, MQ-1, MQ-9,
    and MC-12. This publication does not apply to imaging capability (e.g. SAR) on Battle
    Management Command and Control (BMC2) e.g. E-8C; fighters, bombers or non-traditional
    ISR (NTISR) assets. ISR EIQVP covers sensor output from electro-optical (EO), infrared
    (IR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and film-based sensors; full-motion video (FMV) and
    wide-area motion imagery (WAMI); Advanced Geospatial Imagery collection (e.g., multi-
    and hyperspectral, thermal infrared imaging and advanced SAR processing); and transport
    and processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED). The ISR EIQVP applies to the
    identified systems from fielding through sunset including those designated as Quick Reaction
    Capabilities (QRCs).
    1.3. Image Quality (IQ) Components. The process used to ensure consistently high IQ
    from sensor to analyst is referred to as Image Chain Analysis (ICA). ICA includes the
    subcategories of Sensor and Downlink/Relay Assessment, and Transport and PED
    Assessment.
       1.3.1. ICA is the continuous and systematic assessment and evaluation of IQ throughout
       the entire image chain. This includes establishing baseline system performance
       parameters (metrics), continuously monitoring performance as part of test, evaluation,
       and fielding processes, and evaluation of IQ at each node in the image chain (utility
       measures). ICA is a process that can be used for sensor design, validation, and
       confirmation during operations. Balanced metrics are required for all elements in the
       chain and should be considered/refined during development and upgrades. The image
       chain can be separated into a sensor and downlink/relay segment and a transport and PED
       segment.
       1.3.2. Sensor and Downlink/Relay Assessment is the regular calibration and checkout
       procedures designed to ensure that IQ is optimized from the sensor through the downlink
       to the last node within the relay chain. This includes component performance
       parameters; sensor maintenance; original equipment manufacturer standards; calibration
       requirements; establishing baseline standards, to include the adoption of DoD, NATO,
       and industry best practices for image data transport nodes, including encoding,
       compression, and data encryption sub systems; and IQ reporting metrics and procedures.
       1.3.3. Transport and PED Assessment is the regular calibration and checkout procedures
       designed to ensure that the highest IQ, with the least amount of image data degradation is
       transported, processed, exploited, and disseminated. This includes establishing baseline
       standards, to include the adoption of DoD, NATO, and industry best practices for image
       data transport nodes, including encoding, compression, and data encryption sub systems;

     workstation setup; initial and routine calibration; PED network hardware and software
     configuration and calibration; the exploitation environment; analyst products; and
     reporting metrics and procedures.

Terms
Combat Air Force (CAF)â€”A collection of Air Force organizations, commands and forces that
may be tasked to generate specific precise effects from the air, space and cyberspace. The eight
key organizations that form the basis of the CAF are: Air Combat Command; Air Force Space
Command; Pacific Air Forces; Air Force Special Operations Command; United States Air Forces
Europe; Air National Guard; Air Force Reserve Command; and Air Force Cyber Command.
Essential Elements of Information (EEIs)â€”Those items of information regarding the
adversary and other relevant aspects of the operational environment that need to be collected and
processed in order to meet the intelligence requirements of a commander. Aircrews should
review established EEIs and be prepared to observe any significant information while conducting
their mission and report the observations during debrief.
Image Chain Analysis (ICA)â€”Continuous and systematic assessment and evaluation of IQ
throughout the entire image chain. This includes establishing system baseline performance
parameters, continuously monitoring performance as part of the test, evaluation, and fielding
processes, and evaluation of IQ at each node in the image chain. This includes performance
parameters for components such as sensors; data links, transport networks, encoders and
decoders, display devices, routers and air- and ground-based image processing equipment.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)â€”The originating office for a publication; the author
of the publication is an individual within the OPR. OPRs are solely responsible for the accuracy,
currency, and integrity of their publications and forms.
Point of Contact (POC)â€”The individual designated by the OPR to meet all OPR
responsibilities. POC and OPR are often used interchangeably, but the organization of primary
responsibility retains ultimate responsibility.
Transportâ€”The transfer of video through its distribution architecture without a loss of integrity.
Tier 1 (Tâ€”1)â€”Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders or the AF strongly at risk of mission
or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. T-1
AFI14-135 22 May 2014                                                                     13


waiver requests may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than
MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the publication's approving official.
Tier 2 (T-2)â€”Non-compliance has the potential to create moderate risk of mission or program
degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waivers
may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM
Director.
Tier 3 (T-3)â€”Non-compliance has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or
program degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
Waivers may be granted at the Wing/DRU/FOA/CC level.
