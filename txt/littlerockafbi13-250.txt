This instruction implements AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airspace, Airfield, and Range
Management, 13 series AFIs, and directs procedures to be used for airfield operations activities
at Little Rock AFB. It defines requirements and responsibilities of support agencies for services
required and provided. The procedures and instructions are directive for all assigned base and
partner units and aircrews, but are not intended to supplement good judgment in the interest of
flight safety. The Airfield Operations Board (AOB) has approved this instruction. Deviations to
this instruction are authorized only when directed by Air Traffic Control (ATC), Airfield
Management (AM), or in emergency situations where adherence would jeopardize safe aircraft
operations. This instruction combines various directives, which affect the entire ATC system at
Little Rock AFB, into one document common to all users and service agencies.
Recommendations for improvements to this instruction are encouraged. Changes will be
submitted to the Little Rock AFB Airfield Operations Board (AOB) through the 19th Operations
Support Squadron Airfield Operations Flight (19 OSS/OSA) using the exact wording desired for
approval on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Prior to submission,
changes must be coordinated by the submitting organizations with all affected agencies. 19
OSS/OSA, Airfield Operations Flight Commander, or representative will incorporate all changes
approved by the board. This instruction will be reviewed by the AOB annually. The use of the
name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. This instruction prescribes Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Airfield Management
(AM) procedures for Little Rock AFB. AFI 13-204 specifies applicable items that must be
addressed herein. Command and Wing directives will be consulted in order to determine how to
perform specific operations. The procedures described here are directive in nature and apply to
personnel and aircraft assigned to the 19 AW, 314 AW, 189 AW, and tenant units. Deviations
from the procedures outlined herein are authorized when flying safety dictates, or when directed
by Memphis Center, Little Rock (Adams Field) Approach Control, Little Rock AFB Tower, or
AM Operations.
1.2. Policy. Each partner unit or assigned organization is responsible for ensuring its personnel
are familiar with this instruction.
   1.2.1. The following definitions apply within this instruction.
       1.2.1.1. Shall or must - indicates a mandatory procedure.
       1.2.1.2. Should - indicates a recommended procedure.
       1.2.1.3. May or need not - indicates an optional procedure.
       1.2.1.4. Will - indicates futurity, not a requirement for the application of a procedure.
1.3. Quiet Hours for Special Events on and Around the Flight Line.
   1.3.1. Coordination for “Quiet Hours” requests will begin with 19 OSS/OSO (Current
   Operations). 19 OSS/OSO will then forward a request to the 189 OG/OSO, 314 OG/OGO, 29
   WPS, 19 OG/CD, 314 OG/CD, 189 OG/CC, 19 MXG/CC, 314 MXG/CC, 189 MXG/CC,
   and 29 WPS for coordination. Requests will be forwarded to 34 CTS for info only. 19
   OG/CC will grant final approval. In order to minimize conflict with formation takeoff times,
   events requiring quiet hours should not be scheduled during the following time periods:
   0920-1005, 1115-1300 and 1415-1615. Quiet hours shall be coordinated prior to ordering
   invitations or making other special, permanent arrangements as the times may change subject
   to local flying requirements. Requests must be submitted no later than 10 business days prior
   to event date to allow proper coordination and notification. If the above suspense is not met,
   the requester will require face-to-face approval from 19 AW/CC. If proper coordination is
   not followed, the request for quiet hours is subject to disapproval. Recommend use of loud
   speaker system to help abate noise pollution.
       1.3.1.1. The quiet hours option selected by the 19 OG/CC will be included in the daily
       flying schedule (Bluelines) on the day of the event.
   1.3.2. Special Event Options:

     advance of the requested operation to ensure a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                             9


   7460-1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration is filed as required by Federal
   Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace. Once there is an
   approved FAA waiver, 19 OSS/OSA shall be notified 10 days in advance of any crane
   operation to ensure flying operations are not impacted. Note: When the approved FAA
   Form 7460-1 is returned to the requestor, a copy must be sent to 19 CES and 19 OSS/OSAA.
   Failure to coordinate may result in suspension of construction operations until approved by
   the installation commander.
   1.4.2. Temporary Construction Waivers: All proposed airfield construction must be
   coordinated at least 30 days in advance through 19 CES/CEPD for approval of a temporary
   construction waiver by the 19 AW/CC. See Unified Facilities Criteria 3-260-01
   Airfield/Heliport Planning Design (UFC 3-260-01), Attachments 2 and 15, for further
   information.
       1.4.2.1. Project administrators must submit waivers through 19 CES 45 days prior to and
       no less than 30 days prior to project start.
       1.4.2.2. Waiver requests will detail obstructions requiring a waiver (construction
       equipment, vehicles, etc.), and provide necessary procedures to mitigate any safety
       hazards during the construction.

                                           Chapter 2

                         AIRFIELD FACILITIES INFORMATION

2.1. Airfield Information. Little Rock AFB’s center of the airfield is located at coordinates:
34°55'03"N (34 55.05N), 92°08'42"W (92 08.70W). Field elevation is 310ft Mean Sea Level
(MSL).
2.2. Runway and Assault Zone.
   2.2.1. Runway: The touchdown zone elevation for RWY 25 is 298ft MSL and 307ft MSL
   for RWY 07. The threshold elevation for RWY 25 is 288ft MSL and 285ft MSL for RWY
   07. RWY 07/25 (true azimuth 071/251) is 12,000ft by 200ft with 25ft non-load bearing
   asphalt shoulders. There are 1,000ft asphalt non-load bearing overruns at each end of RWY
   25/07. See Attachment 4.
   2.2.2. Assault Zone (AZ): The AZ (true azimuth 069/249) is 3,500ft by 60ft. The AZ has a
   300ft unmarked load bearing underrun and overrun and 10ft non-load bearing shoulders. The
   AZ is painted with a white rectangle dictating the landing surface. The distance from the
   edge of the Assault Zone to the edge of the main runway is 320ft. See Attachment 4.
2.3. Taxiways. All taxiways (TWY) have non-load bearing shoulders and are 75ft wide except
for TWYs H and J, which are 40ft wide. See Attachment 4.
2.4. Runway Selection Procedures.
   2.4.1. RWY 25 is designated as the calm wind and primary instrument RWY. Mission
   requirements (AADZ run-in, AZ landings, surrounding airspace, etc.) make designation of
   RWY 25 advantageous even when the prevailing winds favor RWY 07.
   2.4.2. When the 19 AW, 314 AW, and/or 189 AW are scheduled to fly, base weather shall
   call tower watch supervisor whenever a tailwind component of 10 knots or more is forecast
   to remain in effect for more than 2 hours. The Watch Supervisor will monitor current wind
   situations at Little Rock AFB and determine if a runway change is necessary.
   2.4.3. If the WS elects to change the active RWY, he/she will notify Command Post, Little
   Rock (LIT) Approach, AMOPs, Tower Chief Controller who will notify 19 OG/CC office,
   and Base Weather. Additionally, tower will attempt to coordinate with 189 AW
   “FOXTROT” prior to changing the RWY in use. As soon as the decision is made to change
   the active RWY. the Tower shall make a transmission on frequencies 121.5 and 243.0
   notifying LRAFB aircraft of RWY change in progress.
   2.4.4. Tower will determine when to commence the RWY change based upon existing air
   traffic. Tower shall coordinate with Little Rock (LIT) Approach, AM Operations, 19 OG/CC
   or designated representative, and Base Weather before changing the runway and notify these
   agencies upon completion of the runway change.
2.5. Airfield Lighting Systems. Airfield lighting controls are located in the tower.
   2.5.1. Runway lighting: RWYs 07/25: HIRLs, ALSF-1 Sequenced Flashing Lights, and
   PAPI lights.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                                   11


   2.5.2. AZ: HIRLs that will be set with RWY lights but not greater than step 3, unless
   requested by pilot.
   2.5.3. Infrared (IR) lights: RWY 25/07 and AZ 069/249 are equipped with IR lighting for
   Night Vision Goggle (NVG) training.
       2.5.3.1. IR lighting configuration pattern is an AMP-2 on RWY 25 and AZ 069/249.
       One IR light is located on either side of RWY 25 at 500ft and 1,000ft, and on the AZ
       069/249 at the threshold and 500ft. Additionally, one strobe light is located on centerline
       at the departure end overrun of RWY 25 and AZ 069/249. Due to equipment limitations,
       AMOPs must receive at least 2 hours advanced notification if aircrews need the IR lights
       set-up on RWY 07. The IR lights are solar-charged/battery powered and are
       automatically activated at night via photo sensors.
   2.5.4. Minimums for inoperative airfield lighting: When airfield lighting, or portions of it, is
   inoperative, the following procedures apply:
       2.5.4.1. See FLIP for decision height and minimum descent altitude no light minimums.
       2.5.4.2. Circling approach minimums are not affected.
       2.5.4.3. Sequenced Flashing Lights (SFL): Although an optional addition to the ALSF-1
       approach lights, SFLs do not change approach minimums; however, the RWY must be
       clearly outlined for landings at night regardless of weather conditions (AFI 11-206, Vol
       3). Outages of any system, or a portion of any system, must be promptly reported to AM
       Operations for a determination of system degradation. If it is determined that there is a
       system degradation, AMOPS will issue a NOTAM IAW AFI 11-208.
       2.5.4.4. Tower will include the following statement on the ATIS:              “APPROACH
       LIGHTS OUT, NO LIGHT APPROACH MINIMA APPLIES.”
   2.5.5. 19 CES will check airfield lighting as outlined in para 2.17.5.2.2. of this instruction.
2.6. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of Airfield. There are no permanently closed or
unusable areas of the airfield.
2.7. Aircraft Arresting Systems. There are no aircraft arresting systems on the airfield.
2.8. Parking Plan/Restrictions. See LRAFBI 11-102, Aircraft Parking Plan.
   2.8.1. Parking ramp responsibility:
       2.8.1.1. The 19th Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) is the OPR for AETC and
       AMC parking ramps.
       2.8.1.2. The ANG parking ramp is coordinated through 189 AW MOC.
       2.8.1.3. The transient alert parking ramp is controlled by AM Operations.
   2.8.2. The Compass Rose is restricted to C-130 or smaller aircraft.
   2.8.3. The Christmas Tree Parking Apron is restricted to C-17 or smaller aircraft. Note:
   Stub 1 of the Christmas Tree is used for AGE equipment parking. All AGE equipment must
   remain behind the white lines. C-130 aircraft wishing to park on stub 1 require prior
   permission from the Airfield Manager or designated representative.

2.9. Air Traffic Control and Airfield Management Operations Facilities.
   2.9.1. The control tower and airfield management will be staffed when locally assigned
   aircraft are scheduled to fly or as directed by the 19 OG/CC. Airfield closures will be as
   scheduled in the IFR Enroute Sup. During low flying periods, the tower may be staffed with
   minimal manning. Airfield management must have two qualified personnel on duty at all
   times, unless otherwise directed by the AOF/CC.
      2.9.1.1. Normally, the daily flying period is 0800L – 0200L, Monday – Friday and
      Saturdays and Sundays when more than four base-assigned aircraft are scheduled to
      conduct local flying.
      2.9.1.2. Little Rock AFB tower and airfield management operations are staffed IAW
      AFMS 13E1, Manpower and Organization Airfield Operations Flight. Emergency
      Staffing Level (ESL), a term for staffing below authorized levels, represents the
      minimum number of qualified personnel available to provide normal services without
      degrading safety.
      2.9.1.3. AM Operations will not factor the Airfield Manager, Deputy Airfield Manager,
      or unqualified 3-level personnel into ESL computations. When AM Operations staffing
      reaches ESL, actions will be taken to mitigate the impact IAW AFIs.
      2.9.1.4. Operating the tower at ESL requires combining control positions and/or staffing
      shifts with a senior controller instead of a dedicated watch supervisor. During tower’s
      ESL and while operating with a senior controller, the VFR traffic pattern may be limited.
      Should any Airfield Operations Flight facility remain at ESL for more than 60 days (or
      personnel staffing declines below ESL), additional curtailment actions will be completed
      IAW AFIs.

       2.11.1.2. Before taking a NAVAID with monitors, 19 CS Operations Flight will inform
       the tower watch supervisor. Note: Flight check on a NAVAID with monitors renders a
       NAVAID unusable for the period of the flight check. AMOPS shall issue a NOTAM
       IAW AFI 11-208.
       2.11.1.3. There are two ground TACAN checkpoints, located on TWY A and E.
       2.11.1.4. Little Rock AFB NAVAID components are not part of the National Airspace
       System.
   2.11.2. Preventative Maintenance Inspection (PMI): 19 CS Operations Flight will notify the
   AOF at least 24 hours in advance of any ATCALS equipment (TACAN, ILS, etc.) requiring
   downtime outside of the No-NOTAM PMI schedule, located in the DoD IFR Enroute
   Supplement. The AOF will coordinate necessary downtime with the Tower Chief Controller,
   Airfield Manager, 19 OSS/CC, 314 OG/CC, and the 19 OG/CC. If the weather is VFR
   during the downtime and there will be minimal wing flying, the 19 OSS/CC may approve
   downtime requests; however, the 19 OG/CC retains final approval authority. Note: 19 CS
   shall use the ATCALS Downtime Request Form found in Attachment 5 when requesting
   ATCALS downtime outside of the No-NOTAM PMI schedule.
       2.11.2.1. Meteorological and Navigational Aid (METNAV) shall attempt to schedule all
       downtime requests prior to or after scheduled wing flying.
       2.11.2.2. 19 CS personnel or contractors must contact the tower watch supervisor/senior
       controller prior to taking any NAVAID off the air or performing any PMI action, even
       during the No-NOTAM PMI window. The tower watch supervisor, AOF, or tower chief
       controller should postpone scheduled PMI during actual or forecasted IMC conditions or
       when visibility goes/or is forecast below 5 miles and ceiling below 3,000ft, IAW AFI
       33-100, Repairing and Restoring Air Traffic Control and Base Weather Facility
       Malfunctions and the DoD IFR Enroute Supplement.
       2.11.2.3. Upon approval of ATCALS downtime, the AOF will notify the tower chief
       controller and/or watch supervisor, and the Airfield Manager.
   2.11.3. Generator Power: During normal operations, all ATCALS facilities are authorized to
   rely on auxiliary power auto-start capability.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                           15


      2.11.3.1. METNAV and civil engineer personnel must obtain tower’s approval prior to
      changing power (generator or commercial) at ATCALS facilities. Generator tests should
      be conducted during non-scheduled flying hours.
2.12. Transient Alert. See the IFR Enroute Supplement for transient services and available
hours.
2.13. Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) Procedures. The ATIS is used for
essential non-control information as outlined in FAA ORDER JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
The following local advisories will be included on the ATIS, when appropriate:
   2.13.1. Bird Watch Condition (BWC) and Deer Watch Condition (DWC), other than Low.
   2.13.2. Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS), when AHAS is reported as Severe.
   2.13.3. Index of Thermal Stress (ITS), when ITS is Caution or higher.
   2.13.4. NOTAMs affecting aircraft operations issued less than 24 hours prior.
   2.13.5. Airfield Advisories.
2.14. Aircraft Special Operations Areas.
   2.14.1. Combat Off-load (COL): Primary COL is conducted on the Compass Rose and may
   be used for day, night, or NVG operations. The secondary COL area is the Christmas Tree
   ramp and may be used for day, night, or NVG operations. AM Operations will issue a local
   NOTAM when the Christmas Tree ramp or Compass Rose is not available. ATOC should
   remove the pallets not later than 30 minutes after the completion of the COL operation and
   perform a complete FOD check of the area and notify tower when the area is usable for
   aircraft operations.
      2.14.1.1. When the primary or secondary COL areas are not available, Zulu parking rows
      can be used if approved by AM Operations (UHF 372.2). AM Operations will ensure no
      transient aircraft are inbound prior to approving a COL in the Zulu parking area.
      Extreme vigilance is required when conducting COL operations in the Zulu parking area.
      When using Zulu row for COL, ATOC should remove the pallets not later than 30
      minutes after the completion of the COL operation and inform AM Ops when complete.
      AMOPS will perform a complete FOD check of the area and notify tower when the area
      is usable for aircraft operations.
          2.14.1.1.1. Aircraft will use an East to West direction to prevent jet blast damage to
          buildings and vehicles, ensuring adequate ramp space is available and aircraft are not
          parked in spots directly in front of the COL aircraft.
   2.14.2. Hot Pit Refueling Areas: Little Rock AFB does not have the capability for hot pit
   refueling.
2.15. Aircraft Tow Procedures.
   2.15.1. Aircraft must be towed by qualified maintenance personnel.
   2.15.2. Maintenance personnel requesting aircraft tows shall:
      2.15.2.1. Contact ground control prior to commencing tow.
      2.15.2.2. Maintain radio contact with ground control until the tow is complete.
 16                                             LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


   2.15.3. If tower observes an aircraft moving without two-way radio contact and the aircraft’s
   intentions cannot be verified with 19 AW MOC, 189 AW MOC or AM Operations, the tower
   will implement anti-hijacking procedures, IAW Little Rock Air Force Base Plan 502.
   2.15.4. Outside of wing flying hours (normally 0200L-0600L) or when the tower is closed
   and after tower releases control to MOC, MOC will handle requests for tow clearances or
   engine runs. Before the start of wing flying, tower will contact MOC for a listing of all
   engine runs/tows being conducted on the airfield. Engine runs will be monitored IAW
   paragraph 2.20.
2.16. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements/Routes.
   2.16.1. Any B-52 arrival must be pre-coordinated with the Airfield Manager 1 day before
   landing to create a runway entry/exit plan. Note: Taxiing aircraft must exercise extreme
   caution during ramp and TWY operations as numerous vehicles transition along the ramp
   and TWY F west of the instrument hold line. These vehicles are not in communication with
   the tower.
2.17. Airfield Maintenance (Airfield Sweeper, Airfield Lighting Procedures, Airfield
Mowing.
   2.17.1. Airfield Sweeper Procedures:
      2.17.1.1. The highest sweeper priority on Little Rock AFB is the airfield. Elimination of
      debris from airfield parking areas and travel routes can significantly reduce Foreign
      Object Damage (FOD) incidents costing thousands of dollars. A regular and systematic
      sweeping program is a very important part of the overall FOD program.
      2.17.1.2. The Airfield Manager, 19 OSS/OSAA, shall be the responsible agency for
      overall monitoring of the sweeper program on the airfield.
      2.17.1.3. Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) personnel will conduct an airfield
      FOD check prior to the start of flying activities and inspect/check the airfield throughout
      the day to ensure all areas remain FOD free. The daily airfield inspection will normally
      be conducted NLT 0800.
      2.17.1.4. All airfield users will pick up FOD as they see it. When the volume of FOD
      and the areas over which it is spread are too great, report the location of FOD
      accumulation to AM Operations.
      2.17.1.5. Civil Engineer Squadron (CE) will dispatch a sweeper and operator daily who
      will report to AM Operations (building 120) prior to 0815, Monday through Friday, for
      sweeping assignments. The operator will check in with AM Ops prior to beginning
      operations, and will check out with AM Ops when leaving the airfield for any reason.
      2.17.1.6. CE will provide an emergency standby operator during weekend and federal
      holiday hours to sweep required areas reported by AM Ops. The standby operator will
      respond to the airfield within 1 hour. The operator will check in with AM Ops prior to
      beginning operations, and will check out with AM Ops when leaving the airfield.
   2.17.2. Sweeper Schedule:
      2.17.2.1. Little Rock AFB currently has three sweepers. One sweeper must be available
      for use on the airfield at all times.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                            17


      2.17.2.2. Daily sweeping requirements are threefold. The first is to clean all areas
      identified through the daily airfield inspection that requires immediate attention. The
      second is normal sweeping of the designated area of the day. When the designated area
      is completed, the operator will report to AM Ops for further assignments or for release, as
      appropriate. The third is for emergency airfield sweeper requirements, i.e., aircraft
      incident/accidents. It is imperative the sweeper operator maintain a state of readiness at
      all times and have the ability to respond to the airfield within 30 minutes.
      2.17.2.3. The weekly sweeper’s schedule by area is shown in Figure 1. Beginning with
      Area I on Monday, Area II on Tuesday, etc.

Figure 2.1. Weekly Area Sweeping Schedule and Diagram.




      2.17.2.4. Sweeper operators will not operate trucks mounted with metal bristles, as the
      bristles tend to separate and create FOD.
      2.17.2.5. When Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) supervision determines that one or
      more limited areas need to be swept, they will contact AM Ops and provide details. AM
      Ops will determine the appropriate priority and dispatch the sweeper in accordance with
      that priority. Note: This procedure applies only to aircraft taxi/tow routes and not
      general areas or parking lots, etc.
      2.17.2.6. If sweepers are not available or cannot adequately clean area to be swept,
      Airfield Management will work with CE to sweep limited areas of major FOD
      concentration by hand. NOTE: The Maintenance Operation Center will provide sweeper
      crews as necessary for these areas.

  2.17.3. Operations.
     2.17.3.1. CE will provide a radio for the sweeper operator. Two-way radio contact must
     be established with the control tower prior to entering the Runway, Assault Zone, and
     Taxiways. The operator will monitor the radio at all times while on these areas. If radio
     contact is lost, the operator will immediately and safely vacate the area and proceed to
     AM Ops.
     2.17.3.2. CE will ensure that all flight line sweeper operators have in their possession an
     AF IMT 483, Certificate of Competency for Airfield Driving and a USAF Restricted
     Area Badge (AF Form 1199), authorizing them access to all areas of the airfield.
     2.17.3.3. Sweeper outages will be reported by LRS and/or CE to AM Ops as soon as the
     information becomes known. Specify the nature of the maintenance problem and
     expected in-commission time.
  2.17.4. Special Emphasis.
     2.17.4.1. Units possessing aircraft have the primary responsibility for the FOD program
     in their aircraft parking areas. When assistance is required due to unusual circumstances
     and to control potential FOD, units should contact AM Ops for sweeper support.
     2.17.4.2. Close coordination will be maintained between CE and the Airfield
     Management to support this instruction to the maximum extent.
  2.17.5. Airfield Lighting Systems Inspection, Maintenance, and Reporting Procedures
     2.17.5.1. Airfield Management will:
         2.17.5.1.1. Conduct a daily nighttime/evening airfield lighting serviceability check.
         2.17.5.1.2. Document airfield lighting discrepancies to include the date/time found,
         who the outage was reported by/to, and follow-up actions until the discrepancy is
         closed.
         2.17.5.1.3. Report lighting outages and/or deficiencies to CE Electrical Systems for
         correction.
         2.17.5.1.4. Outages exceeding allowable tolerances and/or any airfield lighting
         discrepancy which is considered a hazard to flight safety will immediately be reported
         to CE for priority response.
         2.17.5.1.5. Minor outages identified during non-duty hours which fall within
         allowable tolerances and do not pose a hazard to flight safety may be reported the
         following duty day.
     2.17.5.2. CE Electrical Systems Personnel will:
         2.17.5.2.1. Review AM’s airfield lighting discrepancy log.
         2.17.5.2.2. Inspect airfield lighting systems Mon-Fri (except holidays) prior to
         0900L.
         2.17.5.2.3. Notify AMOPS when the lighting inspection is completed, of any
         additional outages, and the status of fix actions until discrepancies are
         repaired/closed.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                          19


          2.17.5.2.4. Respond to airfield upon notification from AMOPS personnel of airfield
          lighting discrepancies which exceed allowable tolerances and pose a hazard to flight
          safety.
      2.17.5.3. These procedures are established IAW AFIs. Deviations to these procedures
      will be coordinated on an individual basis between CE Electrical Systems and AMOPS.
   2.17.6. Mowing Operations: The normal mowing season is between March and October.
   Mowing operations are completed by contract with CE serving as the Quality Assurance
   representative. Airfield grass height will be maintained between 7 and 14 inches. Due to
   sometimes unfavorable airfield conditions, mower operators must check in with AM
   Operations prior to starting airfield mowing operations. AM Operations will notify the
   appropriate agencies depending on the mowing locations. Mowers must contact tower
   whenever mowing on the airfield.
      2.17.6.1. Due to the closeness of the mowers to the AZ, mowers are required to get
      preapproval from the tower before getting within 50ft of the AZ. While in this area,
      mowers are required to maintain radio contact with the tower in case they are required to
      vacate the area for aircraft landings/departures. Mowing operations around the AZ
      should be conducted before wing flying to minimize delays to landing and departing
      aircraft.
2.18. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and Runway Condition Reading (RCR) Values.
   2.18.1. AM Operations will conduct these checks based on current meteorological
   conditions. Results of these checks will be reported to appropriate wing agencies for
   dissemination to aircrews. When the airfield is open, AM Operations is responsible for
   determining and reporting RSC/RCR as required IAW T.O. 33-1-23, Procedures for Use of
   Decelerometer to Measure Runway Slickness, and LRAFB Plan 32-1002, Snow and Ice
   Control. The RSC/RCR and any subsequent changes shall be relayed to tower, command
   post, and base weather. Tower will notify other concerned ATC agencies. AMOPS will
   send a NOTAM whenever the runway surface condition is other than dry.
2.19. Runway Inspections/Checks Procedures and Requirements.
   2.19.1. Airfield Management will inspect the airfield daily prior to the start of flying
   activities. Additional airfield checks will be accomplished as needed IAW AFIs. Normally,
   AM Operations will perform airfield and RWY checks; however, other personnel may be
   delegated the responsibility but must be trained and certified by the Airfield Manager or
   designated representative prior to assuming duties.
   2.19.2. AM Operations will conduct the following specific airfield checks:
      2.19.2.1. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) and Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH): This
      check will be accomplished daily before flying activities begin and as required
      throughout the day.
          2.19.2.1.1. AM Operations will conduct a FOD check, time and traffic permitting, of
          the runway and taxiways before any fighter (excluding A-10) and KC-135R
          lands/departs. Traffic permitting, tower will provide a call to AMOPS upon receiving
          the inbound strip.
 20                                               LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


       2.19.2.2. Airfield Lighting Serviceability: This check will be completed before the start
       of NVG ops, the hours of darkness, or during the overt NVG window.
       2.19.2.3. Runway Surface Condition/Runway Condition Reading will be conducted
       when weather conditions or braking reports require or at pilots request.
       2.19.2.4. In-flight and Ground Emergencies: See Para 6.19.1.
       2.19.2.5. Check for conditions that could affect safe airfield operations during other
       events, such as unauthorized aircraft landings, severe weather, airfield driving violations,
       checks of construction areas, natural disaster (tornado, typhoon, earthquake, etc.).
   2.19.3. When a RWY/TWY check is required, AM Operations will be notified as soon as
   possible. Tower or AM Operations will suspend aircraft operations, in the affected area,
   until the check is complete. Tower will give AM Operations priority access to the runway
   and taxiways if FOD is reported or suspected to conduct FOD checks. If normal operations
   cannot be immediately resumed following the check, AM Operations will close the affected
   area and issue a NOTAM until operations can be resumed.
2.20. Engine Test/Run-Up Procedures. Maintenance personnel or Aircrews requesting engine
runs (throttles out of ground idle range) for maintenance and system checks shall first contact
MOC and then ground control for clearance. Due to radio limitations, 189th AW crews are
exempt from the requirement to contact MOC. Maintain radio contact with ground control until
the engine run is completed. Workload permitting, ground controllers will issue advisories to all
traffic in radio contact requesting to operate behind an aircraft performing an engine run;
however, aircraft commanders are ultimately responsible for aircraft safety when in proximity to
engine run operations. When the tower is closed or daily after wing flying, MOC will handle
requests for maintenance engine runs per paragraph 2.15.4 and 6.14.
   2.20.1. Parking Rows B – Z, spots 1-5 in each row (except U1-2 and V1-2 for ATC tower
   noise abatement), are authorized for idle power engine runs. Aircraft are authorized to
   conduct above flight idle engine runs if the parking spot directly behind is vacant (to include
   taxiing aircraft, vehicle, and pedestrian movement) during the duration of the engine run.
   Note: Aircraft in Papa Row may conduct engine runs regardless of aircraft parked in Romeo
   Row as the necessary distance requirement is met; however, spotters must still consider
   vehicle and pedestrian movement.
   2.20.2. Engine Runs Conducted by Aircrew Members. Note: Aircrews should not normally
   conduct engine runs or propulsion system checks in lieu of maintenance personnel. All
   engine run propulsion systems checks will be performed by qualified aircrew members and
   accomplished IAW MDS specific -1 guidance. MDS specific -6 procedures will be
   conducted by FCF crews only. The aircraft commander is ultimately responsible for ensuring
   all potential danger areas are clear. When conducting engine runs at or above flight idle in
   congested areas (i.e. aircraft parking rows), the aircraft commander will use an external
   spotter (crewmember or maintainer) to monitor the aircraft and danger areas and advise the
   crew of any hazards. The external spotter will connect to the aircraft’s interphone system
   and close the crew entrance door. The external spotter will take a position outboard of the
   left wing, in a position to see the pilot and the area behind the aircraft. After the engine run
   is completed and clearance is given by the pilot, the external spotter can board the aircraft.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                        21


2.21. Noise Abatement Procedures. Formal noise abatement procedures are not applicable;
however, avoid overflying base housing and the school, both located south-southwest of the
runway. See Attachment 2 for VFR ground tracks.
2.22. Noise Complaints.
   2.22.1. During duty hours (0730-1630L), refer all noise complaints to PA (DSN: 731-3601).
   2.22.2. After duty hours, Command Post will record the information and forward it to the
   public affairs office the next duty day.
2.23. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas.
   2.23.1. Localizer & Glideslope Critical Areas:
       2.23.1.1. In addition to standard RWY hold lines, there are instrument hold lines and
       illuminated instrument (INST) hold signs on TWYs F and G.

Figure 2.2. ILS/Localizer Critical Area.
 22                                              LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


Figure 2.3. RWY 25 ILS/Glideslope and POFZ Critical Areas.




      2.23.1.2. The INST hold signs are turned on when the reported weather conditions are
      ceiling less than 800ft and/or visibility less than 2 miles. When the INST hold signs are
      illuminated, tower shall prohibit aircraft or vehicles beyond the INST hold lines if an
      arriving aircraft is inside the final approach fix (FAF) (This procedure is more restrictive
      than FAA ORDER JO 7110.65 and AFIs). The following exceptions apply:
          2.23.1.2.1. Aircraft may be in or over the localizer critical area while landing,
          departing, exiting, or conducting missed approach. DO NOT allow aircraft to stop in
          the critical areas unless an emergency exists.
      2.23.1.3. When the reported weather conditions are ceiling less than 200ft and/or RVR
      2,000ft or less (1/2 mile if RVR is not available) do not authorize vehicle or aircraft
      operations in or over the localizer critical area when an arriving aircraft is inside 1 NM
      from touchdown.
      2.23.1.4. When weather conditions are such that the INST hold lines are NOT in effect,
      but an arriving aircraft is conducting a "coupled approach" or “autoland” the tower shall
      protect the appropriate critical area. Inform the aircraft when the appropriate critical
      areas are not being protected.          (Phraseology: "ILS CRITICAL AREA NOT
      PROTECTED"). NOTE: Vehicles/aircraft must obtain tower clearance to enter either of
      the critical areas when the instrument hold signs are illuminated.
   2.23.2. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ):
      2.23.2.1. The POFZ is an 800 foot wide by 200 foot long rectangular area centered on
      the runway centerline, beginning at and extending outward from the threshold, designed
      to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground vehicles and other aircraft
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                              23


       when the ceiling is less than 300 feet, or visibility is less than ¾ statute mile (or runway
       visual range below 4,000 feet). See Figure 2.3.
       2.23.2.2. The POFZ is considered clear even if the wing of the aircraft holding on a
       taxiway waiting for runway clearance penetrates the POFZ; however, neither the fuselage
       nor the tail may infringe on the POFZ.
       2.23.2.3. IAW LRAFBI 13-202, Non-essential vehicle operators will obtain permission
       from tower to enter the POFZ (which is penetrated while transiting the east end perimeter
       road or holding short of the runway at Txy E) prior to entering the POFZ. Ground
       vehicles essential to airport operations are excluded from this requirement. Essential
       vehicles include those vehicles necessary for the maintenance of the airport and
       navigation facilities, but do not include non-essential vehicles such as construction,
       refueling vehicles, or mowers.
       2.23.2.4. In the event that taxiing/parked aircraft or vehicles are not clear of the POFZ,
       controllers are to provide traffic advisories only to the arriving aircraft regarding the
       position of the offending aircraft/vehicles.
2.24. Airfield Restricted Areas.
   2.24.1. Restricted areas: Areas on the airfield designated by the installation commander for
   the protection of resources. The C-130 parking apron is a designated restricted area (parking
   rows A through Y). Additionally, all aircraft maintenance hangars and the Christmas tree
   parking apron are designated restricted areas when protection-level 3 resources or higher are
   present.
   2.24.2. Individuals must have a restricted area line badge (AF Form 1199) or be escorted by
   someone who does before entering these areas. Contact unit security managers for specific
   details.
2.25. Runway Suspension Procedures. Tower and/or AM Operations should temporarily
suspend RWY or AZ operations anytime an unsafe condition exists (e.g. dropped objects, FOD,
liquid spills, wildlife, etc). AM Ops will complete an airfield check of the affected area and
report status of the RWY/AZ prior to resuming operations. Note: AM Operations has authority
to impose airfield restrictions (close, suspend, or resume RWY/AZ or taxiway operations) as
necessary.
2.26. Airfield Closure Procedures. The process for closure requests outside of published
airfield operating hours can be found in AFI 13-204V3. The AOF/CC will coordinate all
closures with, at a minimum, 19 OSS/OSO, 314 OG/OGO, and 189 OG before requesting final
approval as instructed by AFI 13-204V3 and applicable supplements.
          2.26.1. Will take control of the airfield when the control tower, AMOPS, and airfield
          are closed. Otherwise, owner/user personnel will be actively involved in security of
          their assets by providing internal control and surveillance for aircraft parking areas
          and resources. Security response will be provided by SFS.
2.27. Airfield Opening Procedures.
   2.27.1. Responsibilities:
       2.27.1.1. AM Operations:

          Control of the airfield will be transferred to AM Operations upon request. At that
          time, all information of any personnel in the CMA will be given to AM Operations.
          2.27.1.1.3. Will document on AF IMT 3616, Daily Record of Events, each vehicle by
          call sign that is on the airfield plus any additional pertinent information relayed by
          Security Forces.
             2.27.1.1.3.1. Will advise the control tower via the Tower Net or Tower Hotline of
             all vehicles within the CMA, by call sign, prior to opening.
          2.27.1.1.4. Report for duty 1 hour prior to pre-coordinated ETA/ETD or scheduled
          opening time and complete an airfield inspection/check and transfer control of the
          airfield to tower 30 minutes prior to a pre-coordinated ETA/ETD or scheduled
          opening time, whichever comes first.
      2.27.1.2. Control Tower:
          2.27.1.2.1. Will be operational and expect control of the airfield from AM Operations
          30 minutes prior to a pre-coordinated ETA/ETD, or scheduled opening time.
             2.27.1.2.1.1. Will receive control of the airfield from Airfield Management via
             the Tower Net or Tower Hotline. At that time, the call sign of each vehicle within
             the CMA will be relayed to the Tower.
             2.27.1.2.1.2. Will confirm the location of all vehicles relayed by AM Operations
             and request any other vehicles to check in if not already called by making the
             following announcement to all agencies on the Tower Net: “Little Rock Air
             Force Base airfield is open, contact Tower for approval onto the Controlled
             Movement Area.”
2.28. Radio and Visual Blind Spots.
   2.28.1. Radio: Occasionally, transmissions on the Clearance Delivery frequency are not
   received by the tower from aircraft located in the Christmas Tree and/or the transient ramp
   (Row “Z1” spots 3-5).
   2.28.2. Visual: West of the jumbo hangar (bldg. 250) and the Christmas Tree apron.
2.29. Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF).
   2.29.1. ARFF notifications will be accomplished IAW AFI 13-204V3_AMCSUP.
   2.29.2. The ARFF capability degradation restrictions are defined by the ARFF/Airfield
   Operations Restriction working group, and will be published separately in an Operations
   Letter to be incorporated into applicable checklists and FLIPs as appropriate. The working
   group is co-chaired by the OSS/CC and CES/CC, delegated no lower than their respective
   deputies and will convene IAW AFI 13-204V3_AMCSUP.

                                          Chapter 3

                                 LOCAL FLYING AREAS

3.1. General Description of Local Terrain and Obstructions. The area surrounding Little
Rock AFB is generally flat with some rolling hills (400ft to 500ft MSL) west of the RWY. The
highest obstruction within 25 NM of Little Rock AFB is a television antenna (2,220ft MSL) 17.8
NM southwest, approximately in line with the RWY.
3.2. Local Flying Area.
   3.2.1. Consists of a 600 NM radius around Little Rock AFB. Note: Flights in and around
   the Warrior MOA and KAEX will also be considered local area for members of 34 CTS and
   34 CTS certified Trainer/Mentors.
       3.2.1.1. Restricted areas 2403A/B are located approximately five miles west of Little
       Rock AFB (see Para 3.5.).
       3.2.1.2. There are three drop zones (DZ) in the Little Rock AFB area: All American
       (AADZ) located in R-2403A, which encompasses an AZ; Black Jack (BJDZ) located
       approximately 19 miles NNE of Little Rock AFB and JAX DZ located just north of
       RWY25/07 and at the west end of the AZ on Little Rock AFB (see Para 3.7.).
3.3. Designation of Airspace. The aerodrome is designated as Class D airspace. It
encompasses a 5.6 NM circle from the center of the airfield, from the surface to and including
2,800ft MSL. Two-way radio communication is required with ATC prior to entering the Class D
airspace and will be maintained until exiting the Class D airspace or a frequency change
approval is given by the tower. Little Rock Approach may use portion of the Class D airspace as
shown in the Little Rock AFB Tower and Little Rock Tower Coordination LOA, Attachment 2.
3.4. Fixed Wing Functional Check Flight (FCF) Area. The Little Rock AFB FCF local flying
area begins 30 NM from the Jacksonville TACAN (LRF) to the 600 NM boundary; on a line
from LRF through Jackson VORTAC (JAN), then clockwise to a line from LRF to Walnut Ridge
VORTAC (ARG); then due north of Walnut Ridge VORTAC to the area boundary. Normally,
an FCF will be performed under radar control and in the FCF area to the maximum extent
possible.
3.5. Restricted Areas.
   3.5.1. R-2403 A/B is located 5-9 miles west of Little Rock AFB and can be active up to
   16,000ft. The Department of the Adjutant General of the Arkansas Army National Guard
   controls R-2403A/B. NOTAMs concerning R-2403A/B are found in the Enroute Special
   Notice section under Memphis ARTCC. Little Rock AFB control tower will have R2403
   active times on the DATIS as applicable.
       3.5.1.1. When notified, Little Rock AFB AM Operations may process a local NOTAM
       for the activation of R-2403A/B; however, IAW AFI 11-208, AM Operations is not
       required to issue any NOTAM concerning R-2403A/B activity. The Camp Robinson
       Range Officer coordinates all starts/stops/changes to operations in R-2403A/B with LIT
       Approach Control. Requests to deactivate R-2403A/B, due to an emergency, will be
       made through LIT Approach Control.
 26                                              LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


   3.5.2. When R-2403B is active, instrument approaches to RWY 07 are not authorized.
   Additionally, Category E circling to RWY 07 is not authorized. Note: Run-ins to AADZ
   and AALZ are authorized. Use caution to stay north of N 34° 53.33, Declination Rd, which
   denotes the weapons range on Camp Robinson, approximately 1.4NM south of the AADZ
   southern boundary.
   3.5.3. The Combat Arms complex and EOD detonation area are located 1-2 NM ESE of the
   east end of RWY 25.
3.6. VFR Local Training Areas. N/A
3.7. Local Drop Zones. Procedures for local DZ and AZ use are contained in 19 AW
Supplement to AFI 11-2C-130, Vol 3, 314 AW Supplement to AFI 11-2C-130, Vol 3, and the
Little Rock AFB Aircrew Flimsy. EXCEPTION: See Paras 3.7.1.-3.
   3.7.1. Jacksonville Drop Zone (JAX DZ): JAX DZ is located on the airfield (north of the
   runway and west of the AZ) and consists of two DZs of varying dimensions. Contact 19
   OSS/OSK for information and restrictions.
      3.7.1.1. Use of JAX DZ requires prior coordination with the 19 OG/CC and specific
      authorization of the 19 AW/CC. Before using JAX DZ, mission commanders will ensure
      that 19 OSS/OSK briefs crewmembers and airdrop leaders.
      3.7.1.2. JAX DZ is approved for day and night operations of heavy equipment, container
      delivery system (CDS), and personnel (high altitude low opening and static line).
      CARPS (computed aerial release points) should not fall south of the RWY. In the event
      the CARP falls south of the RWY, approval must be obtained from the 19 OG/CC. Use
      the LRF 275/7 at 1,900ft MSL for the emergency salvo area.
      3.7.1.3. JAX DZ personnel and equipment drops require special emphasis by all parties
      concerned to ensure the safety of the jumpers and ground personnel. All aircraft ground
      movements shall be suspended on TWY F northward and west of TWY D (and vehicle
      movements on tower controlled movement area) until Drop Zone Control Officer
      (DZCO) advises tower personnel that the DZ is clear. DZCO shall maintain radio contact
      with the tower on 275.8 and advise them when drops have terminated. Tower shall
      approve parachute jumping with respect to known or observed traffic and issue advisory
      information to the jump aircraft and to non-participating aircraft as necessary for the safe
      conduct of the jump operation.
   3.7.2. All American Drop Zone/Assault Zone: Scheduling for the use of the DZ/AZ located
   in restricted area R-2403A, will be coordinated IAW LRAFBI 11-201. In the event of an
   emergency, or to affect a cease-fire on R-2403A/B, contact LIT Approach Control and LZ
   controller.
   3.7.3. Black Jack Drop Zone: Scheduling for the use of the DZ will be coordinated IAW 11-
   201.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                             27


3.8. Practice Approaches by Transient Aircraft. Transient aircraft may make practice VFR
or IFR approaches when base assigned or attached aircraft are flying in the tower or radar pattern
as long as they do not interrupt the base’s mission. HHQ directed missions, distinguished visitor
aircraft, Camp Robinson AAF helicopters (Guard Copter), and Air National Guard aircraft
assigned to the 188th Fighter Wing (call sign “Hawg” or “Tusk”) will be given priority over
other transient aircraft. If a formation flight, practice approaches by transient aircraft are
considered local operations and will be assigned priority IAW Para. 9.11.
 28                                               LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


                                            Chapter 4

                                     VFR PROCEDURES

4.1. VFR Weather Minimums. VFR weather minimums in the Little Rock AFB local flying
area are IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. To conduct VFR transition training in the Little Rock AFB
Class D airspace, the reported ceiling must be at or above 1,500ft AGL and 3 SM visibility. The
tower will discontinue VFR training when aircraft are no longer visible from the tower in any
portion of the VFR traffic pattern. Weather minimums for other than USAF aircraft will be IAW
FAA ORDER JO 7110.65.
4.2. VFR Traffic Patterns.
   4.2.1. General Procedures:
       4.2.1.1. The tower watch supervisor will determine the number of aircraft that can safely
       operate in the VFR traffic pattern.
       4.2.1.2. Formation flights conducting different type landings to the RWY, such as #1 full
       stop, #2 and #3 low approach, should request and receive clearance for the “OPTION.”
       Note: Aircraft within a formation flight are not authorized to conduct operations to
       different landing surfaces.
       4.2.1.3. For traffic pattern efficiency and safety, aircraft flying an approach at other than
       normal airspeed ("NO FLAP" approach), shall inform air traffic control of their
       intentions during the downwind leg of the radar or tower patterns.
       4.2.1.4. Air traffic controllers will not approve a pilot's request or request a pilot to
       conduct unusual maneuvers within the Class D airspace if they are not essential to the
       performance of flight. Maneuvers identified in AFI 11-2C-130 Vol 3, applicable AFTTP
       3-3, and this instruction, are considered to be operationally required for wing aircraft, and
       are not classified as unusual maneuvers. All other requests will be denied unless
       specifically approved by the 19 OG or designated representative (19 AW assets) or the
       314 OG or designated representative (314 AW assets).
       4.2.1.5. Aircraft are not authorized to conduct a GROUND-IDLE TOUCH-AND-GO or
       a STOP-AND-GO when cleared for the “OPTION.” These landings must be specifically
       approved by ATC.
       4.2.1.6. Aircraft are authorized to operate at or below 250 KIAS while in the Class D
       Airspace.
   4.2.2. Rectangular Traffic Patterns (see Attachment 2): The traffic patterns will normally be
   entered from the north of Little Rock AFB using a 45-degree entry leg to downwind. The
   traffic pattern altitude is 1,400ft MSL. Any pilot deviation from the pattern altitude by more
   than +/- 100ft MSL requires control tower notification.
       4.2.2.1. RWY 25 Left Closed Traffic: Use of this traffic pattern is directed by the tower
       as necessary, typically to sequence traffic due to formation high-speed downwind
       recoveries to RWY 25, or during formation east-to-west All American Drop Zone run-
       ins.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                            29


         4.2.2.1.1. Turn left crosswind when safely airborne, but no earlier than the end of the
         RWY. Downwind leg shall not exceed 2 NM miles south of airfield, unless
         otherwise instructed by ATC. Aircrews will remain above 1,000’ AGL when Combat
         Arms M-203 training is in progress. During EOD activations, aircrews will not
         overfly the EOD area except when the EOD area is active for non-blast/fragment
         producing explosives or ground burst simulator detonations only.
     4.2.2.2. RWY 25 Right Closed Traffic: Turn right crosswind when safely airborne, but
     no earlier than the end of the RWY, unless otherwise instructed by ATC.
     4.2.2.3. RWY 07 Left Closed Traffic: Turn left crosswind when safely airborne, but no
     earlier than the end of the RWY, unless otherwise instructed by ATC.
     4.2.2.4. RWY 07 Right Closed Traffic: Turn right crosswind when safely airborne, but
     no earlier than the end of the RWY. Downwind leg shall not exceed 2 NM miles south of
     airfield, unless otherwise instructed by ATC. Aircrews will remain above 1,000ft AGL
     when Combat Arms M-203 training is in progress. During EOD activations, aircrews
     will not overfly the EOD area except when the EOD area is active for non-blast/fragment
     producing explosives or ground burst simulator detonations only. Note: If traffic
     permits, tower may authorize closed traffic (crosswind turn) prior to departure end of the
     RWY.
  4.2.3. Overhead Pattern (Attachment 2): Both conventional and jet aircraft may fly the
  overhead patterns. The overhead traffic pattern altitude is 1,900ft MSL. When operating on
  RWY 25, local C-130 aircraft will normally break left at the RWY numbers consistent with
  wing aircraft priority; however, the break may be delayed (i.e. midfield, departure end), as
  directed by ATC for safety or traffic reasons. All other aircraft will be issued a right break
  IAW the IFR Sup, unless otherwise directed by ATC. Note 1: When the EOD area is active,
  Rwy 25 left breaks from the overhead pattern will not be permitted except when the EOD
  area is active for non-blast/fragment producing explosives or ground burst simulator
  detonations only. Rwy 25 right breaks will be approved, traffic permitting. Note 2: To
  comply with noise abatement, the preferred recovery for Rwy 07 overhead is left break.
  Aircraft may perform Rwy 07 right break due to pattern saturation or in the interest of safety.
  Note 3: For drop zone transitions, these procedures only apply to Blackjack DZ when Rwy
  25 is active. During concurrent AADZ/BJDZ operations, overhead transitions are not
  authorized from All-American.
     4.2.3.1. Base assigned C-130 aircraft escaping visually from Blackjack DZ shall squawk
     0322, beginning at the Initial Point (IP), to signal LIT and tower that an overhead
     approach recovery is desired.
     4.2.3.2. On DZ escape, maintain VFR (Day/Night 1500ft MSL), contact LIT, and request
     own navigation to initial. Climb to 1,900’ MSL prior to turning initial.
  4.2.4. To ensure protection of the overhead pattern, when applicable, tower will instruct
  transient aircraft departing from LRAFB to maintain at or below 1,400ft MSL until the
  departure end of the runway.
  4.2.5. All American Run-in Procedures: When All American LZ/DZ operations are active
  and C-130 aircraft are approved for the PLAYNS transition by LIT, the following procedures
  go into effect:
 30                                                 LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


      4.2.5.1. Tower will:
          4.2.5.1.1. Establish a south traffic pattern to de-conflict pattern traffic from
          transitioning aircraft.
          4.2.5.1.2. Release IFR departures IAW the Little Rock AFB & FAA Letter of
          Agreement.
      4.2.5.2. Transitioning C-130 aircraft will:
          4.2.5.2.1. When cleared to AADZ by LIT, maintain at or above 3,000’ MSL until
          PLAYNS (LRF 062/30), then descend and maintain 2,000’ MSL. When formation
          lead is past TYV and at slowdown, aircraft may descend to drop altitude and
          complete the run-in as stated in the Little Rock AFB Aircrew FLIMSY.
4.3. Assault Zone (AZ) Operations.
   4.3.1. Use by other than base assigned C-130’s must be coordinated in advance with the 19
   OG/CC.
   4.3.2. Departures: Aircraft may depart the AZ on an IFR or VFR flight-plan.
   4.3.3. Arrivals:
      4.3.3.1. Aircraft must inform ATC of the landing surface as soon as possible (AZ or
      RWY).
   4.3.4. Weather minimums to request/receive approval to transition to the assault zone are the
   same as circling minimums for the non-precision approach.
   4.3.5. Single aircraft may land on the AZ by transitioning visually from non-precision
   approaches to RWY 25/07. Weather minimums to request/receive approval to transition to
   the assault zone are the same as circling minimums for the non-precision approach. Crews
   must request the transition prior to commencing/receiving clearance for the instrument
   approach (Little Rock Approach will clear the aircraft for the approach). In the case of
   missed approach, crews will transition to the main runway (RWY 25/07) and execute
   published missed approach or (alternate instructions).
      4.3.5.1. Formations are not authorized to land to the AZ since Reduced Runway
      Separation cannot be applied. Traffic permitting, aircraft within a formation requesting
      to recover to the AZ must assume individual call signs and continue as single ships as
      directed by ATC.
      4.3.5.2. Formations are not authorized to depart the AZ unless prior coordinated with
      ATC.
   4.3.6. Tower approves or disapproves AZ approaches based on traffic and shall use the
   following phraseology: "ASSAULT ZONE, CLEARED TO LAND/LOW APPROACH" or
   "UNABLE ASSAULT ZONE" (Time permitting, give reason(s), and provide alternate
   instructions, such as transition to RWY 25, etc.). Note: To the maximum extent possible,
   consistent with pilot qualifications and aircraft performance, pilots will comply with tower’s
   request to transition from one landing surface to another. (I.E. “UNABLE ASSAULT
   ZONE, MAKE LOW APPROACH RUNWAY 25”)
   4.3.7. After landing on the AZ, hold short of RWY 25/07 until given ATC instructions.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                            31


   4.3.8. AZ operations shall be temporarily suspended anytime personnel or equipment are on
   the AZ. Tower will coordinate with AM Operations to ensure expeditious removal of
   personnel and equipment on or adjacent to the AZ to expedite its availability for use.
4.4. Helicopter Operations.
   4.4.1. Helicopters may take off and land on any portion of the movement area depending
   upon tower traffic. Due to uncontrolled vehicles and other aircraft operations, tower will use
   caution when instructing helicopters to depart/land from other than the tower controlled
   movement area. The tower may allow helicopters to cross the RWY at any point depending
   upon other air traffic; however, helicopters shall not overfly any aircraft on the ground.
4.5. Special Procedures.
   4.5.1. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Patterns: SFO patterns are not authorized at Little Rock
   AFB. An actual flameout is an emergency and shall be provided priority handling. Tower
   shall make every effort, time permitting, to clear the Class D airspace prior to an actual
   flameout reporting “High Key.”
   4.5.2. RANDOM STEEP APPROACH: A VFR maneuver allowing base assigned C-130
   pilots to practice approaches and landings in a simulated hostile environment. This
   maneuver is subject to tower approval and consists of a high altitude, steep spiral, and
   descent over the airport to the RWY/AZ. Procedures are as follows:
      4.5.2.1. The pilot shall request this approach from LRF tower at any point in the VFR
      traffic pattern or inform LIT approach on initial contact of proposed approach altitude
      (typically 4,500ft MSL) and the landing surface. Advise ATC, if other than left break
      and one turn to final.
      4.5.2.2. ATC shall relay any known traffic and issue transponder Mode 3 code 0333.
   4.5.3. RANDOM SHALLOW APPROACH: These VFR maneuvers will be approved by
   the tower only during periods of low-density traffic. Single-ship approaches are expected;
   formation approaches require advance coordination and tower approval. Normally, pilots
   will begin this maneuver from the VFR traffic pattern, and maintain radio contact with the
   tower. Airspeed is at the pilot’s discretion, not to exceed 250 KIAS, unless the pilot advises
   that a higher minimum speed is required.
      4.5.3.1. Pilots shall inform the tower of the type approach (i.e. straight-in or abeam) and
      obtain approval prior to departing the traffic pattern or beginning the maneuver if outside
      the traffic pattern. Note: Tower may terminate this approach at any time and direct a
      climb and entry into the VFR pattern.
      4.5.3.2. RANDOM SHALLOW ABEAM: (Not authorized while RWY 07 is in use)
      Random shallow abeam approaches must cross the runway from the north while
      remaining east of the control tower and aircraft shall maintain at 900ft MSL (day) and
      1,100ft MSL (night). Tower shall not approve random shallow abeam approaches when
      the Combat Arms complex is active or during EOD activity.
      4.5.3.3. RANDOM SHALLOW STRAIGHT-IN: Prior to turning final, aircraft will
      climb to and maintain 1,400’ MSL within the Little Rock AFB Class D airspace. Aircraft
      executing a straight-in from the visual pattern should obtain clearance from tower to
32                                            LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


     maneuver to the north/east and remain within 5 NM of the active runway. Descent to
     900’ MSL (day) or 1,100’ MSL (night) is at pilot discretion.
     4.5.3.4. Random shallow approaches (except a straight-in) will enter the Class D
     airspace from the north.
     4.5.3.5. Aircraft shall maintain avoidance criteria IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 3 throughout
     the maneuver.
  4.5.4. Other Random Procedures:
     4.5.4.1. HIGH ALTITUDE PENETRATION DESCENT (PD15, PD25, and PD30):
     This is initially an IFR procedure, until IFR is canceled (outside the Class D Airspace).
     Returning IFR aircraft may request the approach, and ATC will approve/disapprove
     based on traffic. Final approach is completed using a random shallow straight-in
     approach (see Para. 4.5.3.3.). The final altitude is 14,500ft MSL.
     4.5.4.2. HIGH-SPEED DOWNWIND: Primarily used to enter a high-speed downwind
     pattern when visually escaping from AADZ and BJDZ.
        4.5.4.2.1. Entry point: LRF 350/12, regardless of runway in use.
        4.5.4.2.2. DELETED.
        4.5.4.2.3. Base assigned C-130 aircraft escaping visually from All American or
        Blackjack DZ shall squawk 0311, beginning at the Initial Point, to signal LIT and
        LRF tower that a high-speed downwind recovery is desired.
        4.5.4.2.4. On DZ escape, maintain VFR (Day/Night 1500ft MSL), contact LIT, and
        request own navigation or radar vectors to the downwind entry point.
        4.5.4.2.5. At the downwind entry point, fly an approximate heading of 170 to enter
        the downwind pattern, regardless of runway in use. Aircraft shall not proceed past 7
        NM northwest until radio contact has been established with the tower and tower has
        approved the high-speed downwind entry. (Phraseology: “DOWNWIND ENTRY
        APPROVED”).
     4.5.4.3. CARGO WEST: A VFR stereo route allowing predictable VFR flight, along
     with flight following, from Little Rock AFB to Blackjack DZ and return to Little Rock
     AFB. The final altitude is 14,500ft MSL.
        4.5.4.3.1. DELETED.
        4.5.4.3.2. DELETED.
        4.5.4.3.3. DELETED.
        4.5.4.3.4. AFI 11-202 and FAR procedures for VFR flight shall apply throughout the
        entire route. If unable to comply with the VFR rules, aircrew shall advise ATC
     4.5.4.4. BLACKJACK 19: A higher altitude SKE route with a block altitude of 16,000
     through 17,000.
        4.5.4.4.1. DELETED.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                            33


       4.5.4.5. RANDOM SHALLOW TEARDROP:            All teardrop approaches should
       commence from the active RWY downwind entry point described in paragraph 4.2.2.,
       unless otherwise directed by ATC.
          4.5.4.5.1. When departing All American or Blackjack DZ, request clearance from
          LIT ATC and maneuver north until cleared inbound by tower. Proceed inbound until
          within 5 NM, then maneuver to align on the extended runway centerline. Descent to
          at or below 900ft MSL (day) is at pilot's discretion.
          4.5.4.5.2. Do not over fly any landing surface during the teardrop maneuver (i.e. fly
          opposite direction overhead the runway for a late break turn) without explicit
          approval from tower. Initiate a continuous turn to final when the aircraft is abeam the
          landing threshold.
          4.5.4.5.3. For night approaches, maintain 1,500ft MSL until within 5 NM then
          descend to 1,100ft MSL at pilot's discretion.
4.6. Low Altitude Closed Traffic and Circling Approach Procedures. A maneuver that
allows pilots to practice circling maneuvers when a circling approach, to the opposite RWY,
cannot be approved. Pilots may request this maneuver from tower or LIT. The weather
minimums for low altitude closed traffic are transition weather minimums (1,500ft ceiling and 3
SM visibility). The maneuver begins with a non-precision instrument approach, followed by an
over-flight of the RWY along the RWY centerline, and closed traffic at circling MDA.
   4.6.1. When aircraft are transferred to Little Rock AFB tower, the pilot will request low
   altitude closed traffic as follows: ("JODY 63 REQUEST LOW ALTITUDE CLOSED")
   Tower will approve or disapprove low altitude closed traffic based upon traffic conditions.
   The phrase “LOW ALTITUDE CLOSED TRAFFIC APPROVED” is approval for an over-
   flight of the RWY along the RWY centerline followed by closed traffic (at circling MDA) at
   the departure end of the RWY. When disapproving low altitude closed traffic, tower will
   provide alternate instructions. Note 1: When the aircraft begins low altitude closed traffic,
   IFR is automatically cancelled the first time the aircraft crosses the landing threshold. Note
   2: Air traffic controllers shall not allow aircraft conducting “LOW ALTITUDE CLOSED
   TRAFFIC” to over-fly aircraft that are “POSITION AND HOLD.”
   4.6.2. When weather conditions do not permit Low Altitude Closed Traffic (weather below
   transition minimums), pilots may request a “Circling Approach” to RWY aligned with the
   instrument approach procedure. This is an IFR maneuver and pilots are expected to comply
   with all appropriate circling criteria, including keeping the RWY environment in sight. ATC
   will expect pilots to commence this maneuver at the departure end of the RWY or as
   instructed by ATC. For example: For RWY 25, pilots will be instructed to “CIRCLE
   NORTHEAST FOR A RIGHT BASE” or “CIRCLE SOUTHEAST FOR A LEFT BASE TO
   RWY 25.” For RWY 07; pilots will be instructed to “CIRCLE NORTHWEST FOR A LEFT
   BASE TO RWY 07.”
   4.6.3. Circling maneuvers will normally be north of the field to prevent traffic congestion
   and to avoid flying over populated areas. Circling south of the field is not authorized except
   for emergency situations or when directed by ATC for safety reasons.
 34                                                LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


4.7. Reduced Same Runway Separation Procedures.
   4.7.1. RWY 25/07: Tower may use Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) standards,
   as outlined in AFIs, between base assigned or attached C-130 aircraft. Aircrews or air traffic
   controllers may refuse RSRS anytime safety of flight may be jeopardized.
      4.7.1.1. General procedures:
          4.7.1.1.1. Weather must be at or above transition minimums (1,500ft ceiling and 3 mi
          visibility).
          4.7.1.1.2. Runway surface must be dry.
          4.7.1.1.3. RSRS standards are only authorized between similar/compatible type
          operations (departure behind a departure, full stop behind a full stop, full stop behind
          a departure, touch and go behind a touch and go, low approach behind a low
          approach, touch and go behind a departure, touch and go behind a low approach, full
          stop behind an OPTION).
              4.7.1.1.3.1. Full Stop following a Full Stop: The preceding C-130 must be at the
              appropriate separation down the RWY before the succeeding C-130 crosses the
              landing threshold.
      4.7.1.2. C-130 RSRS Minimums:
          4.7.1.2.1. Sunrise to sunset: 5,000ft.
          4.7.1.2.2. Sunset to sunrise: 6,000ft.
          4.7.1.2.3. C-130 formation landings: 6,000ft between formations or formations and
          single ship.
      4.7.1.3. RSRS shall not apply when:
          4.7.1.3.1. Aircraft (succeeding/preceding) are cleared for the OPTION (except full
          stop behind an OPTION), or the preceding aircraft is cleared for a STOP AND GO.
          4.7.1.3.2. Aircraft are cleared for a low approach behind a touch and go or a touch
          and go behind a full stop.
          4.7.1.3.3. A pilot declares an emergency.
   4.7.2. RWY and AZ Separation Procedures: The following minimum separation shall apply
   between C-130 aircraft using the AZ and the RWY.
      4.7.2.1. A C-130 landing on the AZ behind a C-130 landing or departing RWY 25 shall
      not pass abeam the RWY 25 threshold until the preceding C-130 has landed or the
      departure is airborne and 5,000ft down the RWY.
      4.7.2.2. A C-130 landing on RWY 25 behind a C-130 landing on the AZ shall not cross
      the RWY 25 threshold until the preceding C-130 has landed on the AZ. If the AZ is
      planned low approach, ensure that the preceding (AZ) aircraft passes abeam TXY H
      before the succeeding aircraft crosses the RWY 25 landing threshold.
      4.7.2.3. A C-130 landing on RWY 07 behind a C-130 landing on AZ shall not cross
      RWY 07 threshold until the preceding C-130 passes the 6,000ft remaining marker.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010                                                             35


      4.7.2.4. A C-130 landing on the AZ behind a C-130 landing or departing RWY 07 shall
      not pass abeam the landing threshold of RWY 07 until the preceding C-130 has landed or
      the departure is airborne and passed 6,000ft remaining marker. Note: If the preceding
      aircraft in paragraph 4.7.2.4. is a stop-and-go, touch-and-go, or low approach, use
      departure separation criteria.
      4.7.2.5. A C-130 landing on RWY 07/25 behind a C-130 departing the AZ shall not
      cross the RWY 07/25 threshold until the AZ departure is airborne.
      4.7.2.6. A C-130 departing the AZ shall not begin takeoff roll until a C-130 making a
      full stop landing on RWY 07/25 is landing assured.
      4.7.2.7. For C-130 aircraft using the AZ only, apply same RWY separation procedures
      IAW FAA ORDER JO 7110.65. An arriving aircraft must have taxied clear of TWY H
      or J before the succeeding aircraft is allowed to cross the AZ threshold or begin takeoff
      roll.
4.8. Line up and Wait Procedures.
   4.8.1. To expedite traffic, aircraft may be taxied into takeoff position to hold on one surface
   while traffic is landing or taking off on the other surface. ATC shall issue traffic advisories
   IAW FAA ORDER JO 7110.65.

   4.8.1.1. HQ AFFSA and the FAA have issued a waiver (on file at 19 OSS/OSA) which
   allows one base assigned or attached aircraft at a time to taxi into position and hold at an
   intersection on the main RWY during the hours of darkness when the controller can visually
   see the aircraft holding in position and uses established memory aids.
4.9. Intersection Departures. RWY intersection departures may be made from the following
TWYs:
   4.9.1. RWY 25: TWYs C, D, H, and J.
   4.9.2. RWY 07: TWYs B, C, and H.
   4.9.3. The distance remaining from the intersection to the end of the RWY will not be
   transmitted to locally based aircraft except upon pilot request. Distances remaining from
   intersections are depicted in Attachment 4.
   4.9.4. To avoid delaying AZ departures, aircraft using TWY D intersection should be ready
   for departure upon reaching the RWY. If a delay is anticipated at TWY D, continue to TWY
   E for departure.
   4.9.5. To avoid delaying aircraft exiting the AZ from TWY H, aircraft using TWY C for
   departures should be ready for departure upon reaching the RWY. If a delay is anticipated,
   continue to TWY E for departure.
   4.9.6. Whenever an aircraft is parked on the secondary or tertiary Hot Cargo Pad (the
   compass rose or intersection of taxiways Alpha and Foxtrot) the following restrictions apply:
   Runway 25 Intersection departures are only authorized from Taxiway Delta or the full length
   of Runway 25. Runway 07 full length departures are prohibited. This is to mitigate an
   increased risk to operations as the result of an ORM Assessment conducted as part of the
   MAJCOM approved HCP waivers.

4.10. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations. NVG operations are authorized to Runway
25/07 and Assault 249/069. Note: Requests to turn the runway and assault zone lights on or off
shall be made through the tower and will be taken in the following priorities: Non NVG capable
aircraft arriving from off station, local a/c not utilizing NVGs, then NVG aircraft. Final approval
authority before changing the lighting configuration is the Tower WS.
   4.10.1. During airfield covert lighting operations, RSRS cannot be applied.
       4.10.1.1. NVG operations to an IR/covert only lighted airfield are not authorized while
       non-participating aircraft are within the Class D airspace.
       4.10.1.2. Tower shall turn off airfield lighting only after non-participating or non-NVG
       aircraft have departed the Class D airspace.
   4.10.2. Non-NVG flight training may be conducted to a normal/overt lighted landing surface
   while NVG flight training is being conducted to the other, IR/covert only lighted, landing
   surface. Reduced Same Runway Separation is authorized only when Rwy25/07 is overt
   lighted.
       4.10.2.1. DELETED.
           4.10.2.1.1. Taxiways H and J will be turned off whenever the Assault Zone is the
           IR/covert only landing surface and turned on when Runway 25 is the IR/covert only
           landing surface.
           4.10.2.1.2. DELETED.
           4.10.2.1.3. Airfield lighting on the normal/overt lighted surface will normally be
           operated IAW FAA ORDER JO 7110.65 during local night operations, unless
           otherwise requested. The approach lights will be turned off when requested.
       4.10.3. Little Rock AFB air traffic controllers do not use NVGs while controlling aircraft
       in the air or on the ground. Controllers will only use NVGs to enhance situational
       awareness of the airfield. Use of NVGs will be at the discretion of the WS. The interior
       tower cab lighting shall be adjusted if using NVGs to observe NVG operations.

                                      IFR PROCEDURES

5.1. Air traffic control service at Little Rock AFB.
   5.1.1. Air Traffic Control Service is provided by the following agencies:
       5.1.1.1. Memphis Center (ZME)
       5.1.1.2. Little Rock Approach Control (LIT)
       5.1.1.3. Little Rock AFB Control Tower (LRF)
5.2. IFR Control. IFR traffic above 15,000ft MSL is controlled by ZME. LIT provides
approach and departure control services to aircraft within approximately a 30 NM radius of LIT
VORTAC up to and including 15,000ft MSL. LRF tower is responsible for providing VFR ATC
service within the Little Rock AFB Class D Airspace. The operating hours for Little Rock
AFB’s airfield are contained in the IFR Supplement.
   5.2.1. LIT provides basic radar service to all aircraft transitioning to and from Little Rock
   AFB and will consist of safety alerts, traffic advisories, limited radar vectoring when
   requested by the pilot, and sequencing VFR traffic with IFR and other participating VFR
   traffic.
   5.2.2. Due to high traffic volume, all arriving VFR aircraft will contact LIT Approach
   Control for sequencing prior to entry into Little Rock AFB airspace.
   5.2.3. Although basic radar service is not mandatory, radar use enhances the overall air
   traffic system and is encouraged. If service is not desired, the pilot must state "negative radar
   service" on initial call-up. ATC will assume all VFR aircraft are participants unless informed
   otherwise.
5.3. Radar Traffic Patterns. As vectored by LIT approach control.
5.4. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures. As directed by LIT ATC.
5.5. Local Departure Procedures. Note:          Little Rock AFB does not have any published
Departure Procedures (DP).
   5.5.1. Charlie Climb-out Instructions:
       5.5.1.1. CHARLIE CLIMB-OUT: A departure clearance (not a DP) assigned by tower
       or LIT to aircraft requesting to depart and enter the radar traffic pattern, or remain in the
       radar traffic pattern for instrument approaches. The clearance limit is LRF and it replaces
       other missed approach instructions.
          5.5.1.1.1. Aircraft cleared for Charlie Climb-out will fly RWY heading, climb and
          maintain at or below 1,400ft until departure end of RWY (maintains overhead traffic
          pattern protection), then climb and maintain 2,000ft, at 2 DME turn right heading 360
          (RWY 25) or left heading 360 (RWY 07), contact local channel 9 (257.625 or
          120.125 or LIT frequency as assigned).
 38                                              LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


          5.5.1.1.2. In the event the TACAN is out of service, aircraft will execute the Charlie
          Climb-out as published, except turn right heading 360 (RWY 25) at LIT 352/14 or
          turn left heading 360 (RWY 07) at LIT 007/15.
   5.5.2. Departure Control Instructions: Formation departures shall be changed to departure
   control frequency before takeoff. Any emergency instructions from the tower, after the
   formation has changed to departure frequency, will be broadcast on GUARD frequency(ies).
   5.5.3. When pilots request a local IFR clearance to LIT that was not part of the original
   flight plan, controllers will issue ―Cleared to Little Rock Adams Field as filed‖ in lieu of
   reading the full route clearance over the radio. Although radar vectors are common, aircrews
   should understand that ATC expects the pilot to fly the stereo routing to LIT as stated in the
   Flimsy (LRF248008 BEGEE TYV LIT). Pilots may request LRF or LIT to fly direct to LIT
   Adams Field. All requests will be taken on an individual basis.
5.6. Availability/Restrictions for Surveillance (ASR) Approaches and Precision Approach

                                 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

6.1. General. Specific procedures cannot be prescribed for every situation that might be
considered an emergency. As a general rule, an emergency includes any situation, which places
an aircraft, people, and/or property in danger or distress. If it is unclear whether a situation is an
emergency, treat it as an emergency.
6.2. Types of Declared Emergencies. When an aircrew declares an emergency it will be
classified as one of the following emergencies: in-flight, ground, or physiological.
6.3. Operation of Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and Secondary Crash Net (SCN).
   6.3.1. Primary Crash Alarm System: IAW AFIs, the primary crash circuit is limited to two-
   way communications with the fire department, AM Operations, and the flight surgeon
   (during clinic operational hours). Additional agencies may have receive-only capability.
   Note: The flight surgeon’s office is only staffed during normal duty hours. After normal
   duty hours, the fire department will make the necessary calls for medical personnel.
   6.3.2. Secondary Crash Net: IAW AFIs, the secondary crash net is operated by AM
   Operations. All information received over the PCAS shall be transmitted verbatim over the
   SCN.
   6.3.3. To ensure system reliability, the PCAS and SCN shall be tested daily between 0830
   and 0900L.
6.4. On/Off-Base Aircraft Mishaps or Emergencies. In the event of an aircraft mishap or
emergency, tower will:
   6.4.1. On-Base: Immediately activate the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) providing
   all available information regarding the emergency. Information should include: type of
   emergency, call sign, type aircraft, location, estimated time of arrival, landing RWY,
   personnel on board, fuel on board, current wind, hazardous cargo, nature of emergency, and
   any other pertinent information.
       6.4.1.1. Suspend normal operations when an aircraft mishap is observed or when normal
       operations would conflict with an emergency aircraft's priority.
       6.4.1.2. The ground controller will notify ground traffic and taxiing aircraft to "HOLD
       POSITION" when emergency (crash) equipment moves out to respond to the emergency.
       Normally, ground operations will resume after the emergency has been terminated;
       however, ground movements may be approved on a case-by-case basis, prior to
       emergency termination, after coordination with the Incident Commander/fire chief.
       6.4.1.3. Relay additional information to crash crew personnel over the two-way radio.
       All references to the crash site will include location or grid map coordinates if available.
   6.4.2. Off-Base: In the event an off-base mishap report is received from a credible source,
   (ATC facility, Sheriff’s Department, etc.) the following shall apply: Note: Anytime the
   source of a mishap report is questionable, tower shall notify command post to verify the
 40                                              LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010

       6.4.2.3. The designation and responsibilities of the Incident Commander can be found in
       LRAFB Plan 91-204, Mishap Response Plan. The Fire Chief is normally the Incident
       Commander; however, the Incident Commander will be designated by the 19 MSG/CC.
6.5. External Stores Jettison Areas. The jettison area is located on the eastern edge of R-2403
A/B, and west of the Rock Ridge and Cato Mountain Ridge in Faulkner County. Controllers
shall not determine the exact time or location of external stores release).
   6.5.1. The primary emergency jettison area is located on the LRF 275/7 NM at a desired
   altitude of 1,900ft MSL.
   6.5.2. Aircraft operating VFR will notify the tower of an emergency situation requiring
   jettisoning and may obtain an approach control frequency for vectors to the jettison area.
   6.5.3. When aircraft are “own navigation,” the aircraft should maintain RWY heading (250
   MH) for 7 NM miles and turn north for 3 1/2 NM miles to the jettison area.

   9.8.3. No-notice Requirements: As soon as possible after becoming aware of a no-notice
   DV arrival, tower shall notify AM Operations. AM Operations will immediately notify
   command post upon receipt of the estimated time of arrival (ETA).
   9.8.4. At no time will safety of flight be jeopardized to provide priority handling for a DV
   aircraft.
       9.8.4.1. Arriving and departing DV aircraft will be sequenced and handled on a first-
       come, first-served basis consistent with the local aircraft priorities listed in paragraph
       9.11. Note: When priority handling of DV aircraft is in the best interest of the 19 AW,
       the 19 AW/CC/CV, 19 OG/CC, 19 OSS/CC, or the AOF/CC may direct priority handling
       of DV aircraft over any 19 AW aircraft which normally are authorized higher priority.
       9.8.4.2. Requests for priority DV handling will be made through command post to the
       tower.
       9.8.4.3. Upon receipt of a DV priority request, tower will complete all necessary actions
       to allow the unimpeded taxi, takeoff, or landing of the DV aircraft consistent with the
       local aircraft priorities listed in paragraph 9.11.
9.9. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo. These procedures are in addition to those contained in
AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Material. Taxi routes
and other procedures applicable to hazardous material and contaminated aircraft are established
for use at Little Rock AFB.
   9.9.1. Notification of inbound aircraft carrying hazardous cargo may be received from the air
   terminal operations center, tower, pilot-to-dispatch message, flight service, etc. AFJI 11-204
   requires aircraft carrying hazardous cargo or inert devices to indicate type cargo in the
   remarks section of the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan. A base agency receiving
   information on an inbound aircraft carrying hazardous cargo will relay all available
   information to AM Operations. AM Operations will notify and keep the appropriate agencies
   updated.
   9.9.2. Parking for hazardous cargo aircraft will be IAW LRAFBI 13-205, Aircraft Parking
   Plan.
9.10. Wear of Hats. Hats are not authorized on the Little Rock AFB flight line. This restriction
is an effort to reduce Foreign Object Damage (FOD) risk to aircraft. IAW LRAFBI 21-140,
Foreign Object Damage and Dropped Object Prevention Programs, exemptions are as follows:
   9.10.1. Protocol duties when hats are appropriate (i.e. greeters).
   9.10.2. Security forces and emergency personnel when headgear/hats are required.
   9.10.3. Aircraft maintenance personnel when protective/weather headgear. Note: All
   personnel wearing hats and/or headgear must remove all head garments/gear in the vicinity
   of aircraft engine intakes, exhausts, props wash, and jet blasts, as loose garments can cause
   serious damage to aircraft engines.

   missed approach instructions will be issued "FLY RWY HEADING, CLIMB AND
   MAINTAIN AT OR BELOW 1,400ft UNTIL DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY, THEN
   CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2,000ft," or as otherwise instructed by ATC.
9.16. Flight Line Smoking Policy Smoking is prohibited on Little Rock AFB Flight Line
except at designated smoking locations along Flight Line Drive.
9.17. Civilian Aircraft Operations. Civilian aircraft may use base navigational aids and tower
services. Practice approaches (IFR/VFR) are not authorized during wing flying (base assigned or
attached). Outside of wing flying, civil aircraft may make low approaches only. Note: For
other than a low approach, approval must be obtained IAW AFR AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft
Landing Permits. If an unauthorized aircraft lands at Little Rock AFB, the tower will activate
the primary crash alarm system.
   9.17.1. Use of Little Rock AFB by civil/general aviation is not authorized. Only the
   Installation Commander or designated representative can grant exceptions to this policy.
       9.17.1.1. Except for emergencies, no civil aircraft will land without approval of the 19
       AW/CC or designated representative.
       9.17.1.2. Requests for civil aircraft landing permits will be processed through
       Headquarters USAF/XOOCA IAW AFI 10-1001. Note: Under certain conditions, civil

 52                                               LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


   9.17.2. Unauthorized landings present a distinct security risk to Little Rock AFB. If a pilot
   files a flight plan to and lands at Little Rock AFB without first obtaining prior permission,
   the 19 AW/CC or designated representative may categorize the landing as unauthorized in
   IAW AFI 10-1001.
   9.17.3. When a civil aircraft, without a PPR requests permission to land, AM Operations will
   inform the tower watch supervisor that no prior approval has been obtained and the aircraft is
   to be denied landing rights.
   9.17.4. If the pilot of a civil aircraft declares an emergency and needs to land at Little Rock
   AFB, the tower watch supervisor/controller-in-charge will allow the aircraft to land, direct
   him to clear the active runway and hold position, and notify AM Operations of location. In
   this situation, the tower shall activate the PCAS to inform base agencies of both an IFE and
   an unauthorized aircraft landing.
      9.17.4.1. Upon receiving the information from the PCAS, AM Operations will
      immediately ring the secondary crash net. 19 SFS will dispatch a security team to the
      aircraft to maintain security of the aircraft and crew and, if necessary, conduct follow-on
      actions as directed by the Incident Commander.
      9.17.4.2. AM Operations supervisor will respond to the aircraft and coordinate with ATC
      to ensure the aircraft is held in position until 19 SFS responds.
      9.17.4.3. AM Operations will notify the AOF/CC.
      9.17.4.4. AM Operations will have Transient Alert provide a vehicle to the aircraft and
      standby to escort and/or park the aircraft.
      9.17.4.5. The Airfield Manager or designated representative will proceed to the aircraft
      to determine landing validity.
      9.17.4.6. The responding representative will interview the pilot and obtain a written
      circumstantial report, copies of pilot’s license, driver’s license, aircraft registration, and
      copies of reports taken by other responders such as FAA, Security Forces, or Secret
      Service.
      9.17.4.7. Once the interview is completed the category of landing will be ascertained (the
      installation commander or a designated representative will identify an unauthorized
      landing as either an emergency landing, an inadvertent landing, or an intentional landing)
      and appropriate labor, material, etc. cost will be assessed according to AFI 10-1001 and
      appropriate report sent to HQ USAF XOO/CA.
      9.17.4.8. The AOF/CC will update the 19 OG/CC and 19 AW/CC.

areas supporting PL1, 2, or 3 resources unless approval has been granted by the group
commander owning the resources or by the 19 AW/Public Affairs Division in writing. Cell
phones equipped with a camera feature are not to be used for photography in restricted areas
without proper authorization. Airfield Management has received approval from PA to take
pictures on any portion of the airfield. See LRAFBI 31-101, Little Rock AFB Installation
Security Instruction for specific details.
9.26. Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) Ground Operations. JRTC aircraft will
normally conduct operations on TWY G and the Christmas Tree. JRTC personnel will
accomplish marshaling and aircraft handling. JRTC aircraft may use the transient ramp only
after coordination with the airfield management.
9.27. Mid-Air Collision Avoidance Program (MACA. The goal of the MACA Program is to
enhance the safety of pilots with whom we share airspace. The purpose of the program is to
educate civilian pilots about Little Rock AFB flying operations and military pilots about civilian
flying operations.
   9.27.1. Little Rock National/Adams Field airport is located 12 NM miles south of the
   airbase. The traffic patterns are separated; however, certain maneuvers can bring aircraft into
   close proximity with individuals in other patterns.
   9.27.2. North Little Rock airport is 7 NM miles southwest of the base, and Camp Robinson
   airport is 8.3 NM miles southwest of the base. Visual and instrument traffic patterns to Little
   Rock AFB are north of RWY 25/07 in order to minimize conflicts with other area traffic.
   9.27.3. Toneyville NDB is located 5.6 NM miles from the approach end of runway 25, and is
   the final approach fix for the NDB approach. A high volume of civil and military air traffic
   passes this fix. In addition, the NDB is also used for holding patterns at or above 2,000ft
   MSL.
 54                                                LITTLEROCKAFBI13-250 29 APRIL 2010


   9.27.4. Potential Conflict Area: Highway 67/167 makes a convenient visual landmark for
   aircraft traveling between Little Rock and Searcy, Walnut Ridge, or Jonesboro. The highway
   passes through the Little Rock AFB Class D airspace and crosses the final approach course to
   RWY 25, just inside the Toneyville NDB. This area has historically been a potential conflict
   area and pilots are advised to be extremely vigilant when operating in this area.
9.28. Quarterly Joint Airfield Inspection. The purpose of the inspection will be to note
hazards, identify new short and long range requirements, validate previously identified
maintenance requirements and identify items that could have safety of flight connotations. This
inspection will provide an avenue for identifying and eventually prioritizing issues impacting
safe operations and mission accomplishment. Participants will be the Airfield Manager or
Deputy Airfield Manager, ATC, Safety, TERPs liaison (if available), and 19 CES (community
planner, pavements engineer, horizontal shop, and electrical shop). Note: The annual Airfield
Waiver Inspection will be completed simultaneously with the 2nd Quarter Quarterly Joint
Airfield Inspection.
9.29. Annual Airfield Certification/Safety Inspection. The purpose of the inspection will be
to note any potential hazards and validate previously identified hazards for status (removed or
remaining). In addition, it acts as a standardized inspection program to validate whether Little
Rock airfield meets standards and elevates the status of the airfield facilities to wing leadership.
This inspection will be completed simultaneously with the Quarterly Joint Airfield Inspection
each September.
   9.29.1. The Airfield Certification/Safety Inspection Checklist listed in 13 series AFIs will be
   used. Brief results at the AOB and maintain a copy on file for 12 months.
   9.29.2. Participants will be the Airfield Manager, 19 CES (community planner, pavements
   engineer, horizontal shop, and airfield lighting), and 19 AW/SEF. Representatives from
   ATCALS maintenance, Weather, Security Forces, and the TERPS liaison (if available) are
   highly encouraged to participate to provide technical expertise in their area of responsibility.
   9.29.3. The 19 AW/CC will review/coordinate on the formal report and indicate whether the
   airfield meets USAF standards. If not, identify corrective action being taken and estimated
   “Get Well” dates.

        CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA & VEHICLE CONTROL AREA

A3.1. CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA (CMA):
  A3.1.1. The following areas on the airfield are part of the Tower CMA: Runway, Assault
  Zone, Taxiways Alpha through Echo, grassy areas north of Taxiway Foxtrot (except fuel
  facilities outlined in Attachment 4), and the eastern portion of Taxiway Foxtrot beginning at
  the instrument (INST) hold line. Additional areas include Taxiway Golf from Echo to the
  entrance (marked by the INST hold line) of the Christmas Tree Apron. The CMA continues
  west, north, and east from these areas to the tree line around the airfield. All operators must
  comply with CMA restrictions and procedures IAW LRAFBI 13-202.
  A3.1.2. Vehicle operators intending to operate within the CMA must establish direct two-
  way radio contact with the Tower (or contact Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) duty
  desk during airfield closures) and receive approval prior to entering any portion of the CMA
  (includes Meteorological and Navigational Aid (METNAV) Maintenance, Airfield Lighting,
  CE Horizontal Shop, etc.). Vehicle operators will remain in radio contact with the Tower at
  all times while operating within the CMA. If radio contact is lost (or cannot be established)
  with personnel or vehicles on the RWY or AZ, tower will flash the appropriate light gun
  signal, or turn the applicable RWY edge lights on and off as an emergency signal for
  personnel operating vehicles to immediately exit the tower controlled movement area. If
  emergency signals fail to recall the vehicle, the tower shall inform AM Operations. AM
  Operations will attempt to intercept the vehicle. Note: The tower may suspend aircraft
  operations when an uncontrolled aircraft, vehicle, or pedestrian is observed entering the
  controlled movement or non-movement areas which may create a hazard to the safe
  movement of aircraft.
A3.2. VEHICLE CONTROL AREA (VCA):
  A3.2.1. Vehicle Control Area (VCA): The grassy areas south of Taxiway Foxtrot, east and
  west of the parking apron, to the tree line south of the airfield. Additional areas include the
  Christmas Tree and all fuel pump houses/maintenance facilities, with direct access from non-
  CMA portions of Taxiway Foxtrot.
  A3.2.2. Vehicles operating in this area are not required to have contact with the tower (or
  Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) airfield closure); however, driver requirements and
  vehicle movements must be IAW LRAFBI 13-202.
