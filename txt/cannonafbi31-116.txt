                                         INTRODUCTION

1.1. Responsibilities.
     1.1.1. 27 SOMSG/CC establishes and manages the local installation traffic supervision
     program.
     1.1.2. Defense Force Commander (DFC) is the principal advisor to the Traffic Safety
     Coordination Group (TSCG) and 27 SOMSG/CC on issues pertaining to the safe movement
     of personnel and traffic. The DFC exercises staff responsibility for directing, regulating and
     controlling traffic and enforcing installation rules pertaining to traffic control. The DFC
     administers the suspension and revocation of on-base driving privileges as required by this
     directive pursuant to the traffic point system.
     1.1.3. Units/Organizations: Commanders are responsible for ensuring each individual
     assigned to their respective units/organizations understands applicable traffic laws and has a
     valid drivers license, insurance and registration prior to operating a motor vehicle on Cannon
     AFB.
1.2. Authority of this Instruction.
     1.2.1. 27 SOW/CC delegates the authority under this instruction to 27 SOMSG/CC and 27
     SOMSG/CD. All instances referencing the installation commander in AFMAN 31-116 and
     AFI 31-218(I) will be the responsibility of 27 SOW/CC or designee (27 SOMSG/CC or CD).
     1.2.2. The New Mexico Motor Vehicle Code, as amended by this instruction, governs motor
     vehicle operations on Cannon AFB and areas under its jurisdiction.
     1.2.3. The Cannon AFB Integrated Defense Plan provides detailed guidance on entry
     authorizations and procedures for the installation. It also includes responsibilities of sponsors
     and is the exclusive directive outlining guidance in this area. AFI 31-101 is the deciding
     document for conflicts of base entry procedures and responsibilities and takes precedence
     over this directive.
1.3. Authority of Security Forces and Fire Officials.
     1.3.1. Security Forces personnel and other persons assigned by the DFC are authorized to
     enforce the Installation Traffic Code and applicable New Mexico traffic laws by voice, hand
     or other signal.
     1.3.2. Fire Officials. Fire Department officials are authorized to direct traffic at the scene of
     a fire response.

     Forces or Fire Department officials performing their official duties.
     1.4.2. Vehicle operators will produce vehicle registration, proof of insurance, driver’s
     license and military identification upon request from Security Forces.

                                TRAFFIC REGULATIONS

2.1. Enforcement of Traffic Code.
   2.1.1. This supplement is established to regulate traffic on the roadways and parking areas of
   Cannon AFB. By virtue of the Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. §13), the provisions of
   the New Mexico Vehicle and Traffic Code are adopted as federal law and will be enforced as
   traffic control measures, except where noted below, in all areas under the control of the
   installation commander. In those cases where there is a disagreement, this traffic code will
   take precedence. The following regulations further define Cannon AFB-specific traffic code.
   2.1.2. LIDAR/RADAR operators shall be trained IAW New Mexico training standards by
   certified trainers. Operators will be recertified every 3 years.
   2.1.3. The DFC will ensure Security Forces members authorized to issue DD Form 1408,
   Armed Forces Traffic Ticket and CVB Form 1805, United States District Court Violation
   Notice are trained and receive task certification on procedures by supervisory personnel prior
   to issuing either form. Training will be documented in the Career Field Education and
   Training Plan.
      2.1.3.1. Fix-it Tickets: If proof of valid vehicle registration, valid insurance, or valid
      driver’s license is not produced, the operator will be issued a fix-it-ticket along with a
      consideration of revocation of driving privileges letter. If the individual did not have
      valid, current insurance or registration at the time of the citation, then the ticket will
      stand. After being cited, the operator will have 72 hours to provide proof of insurance and
      registration to 27 SOSFS/S5R. For all other fix-it-tickets individuals can report to the
      Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC).
      2.1.3.2. Individual will receive a consideration to suspend base driving privilege letter
      from 27 SOSFS/S5 section if reasons for the citation cannot be fixed.
      2.1.3.3. Rebuttal/Voiding a DD Form 1408. In the event an individual does not agree
      with a citation he or she has received, the individual must notify S5R within five duty
      days of their intent to rebut the citation. The violator must submit a rebuttal letter
      articulating his/her position to the DFC through 27 SOSFS/S5R within 14 duty days of
      receipt of the ticket. The letter must be endorsed by the individual’s commander (see
      Attachment 2 for an example). The purpose of this endorsement is to ensure commander-
      level involvement. The commander must add comments supporting the violator’s guilt or
      innocence. The completed package will be forwarded to the DFC for his/her annotation
      and/or recommendation and subsequently to the rebuttal authority (27 SOMSG/CC or
      CD) for final decision. Once the rebuttal authority has made a decision, 27 SOSFS/S5R
      will notify the violator of the final outcome of the ticket rebuttal.
      2.1.3.4. The rebuttal process for DD Forms 1805 is through the US Magistrate Court.
2.2. Emergency Vehicle Operations.

     2.2.1. Emergency Vehicle Defined. Ambulances, Security Forces, fire, explosive ordnance
     disposal, disaster response and command and control vehicles are considered emergency
     vehicles.
     2.2.2. The driver of an authorized emergency vehicle, when responding to an emergency call
     or when in pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law or when responding to but not
     upon returning from a fire alarm, may exercise the privileges set forth in this section subject
     to the conditions stated. The driver of an emergency vehicle may:
        2.2.2.1. Park or stand, regardless of the restrictions in this code.

       prior to operating the vehicle on any roadway.
       2.16.3.4. LSVs must be equipped with specified headlamps, stop lamps, turn signal
       lamps, reflex reflectors, parking brakes, rear view mirrors, windshields, seat belts and
       vehicle identification numbers.
   2.16.4. Conveyances designed or modified to operate at speeds greater than 25 mph must
   meet all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which apply to passenger carrying
   vehicles. These standards are much more stringent than LSV safety standards.
   2.16.5. 27 SOSFS may at any time verify the maximum speed of any golf car or LSV to
   ensure its compliance with this supplement.
2.17. Random Installation Entry/Exit Vehicle Checks (RIEVCs). RIEVCs are derived from
an approved computer generated random list signed by the 27 SOW/CC or their designee
identifying the date, time, and criteria for vehicle checks. These random checks are not based
upon probable cause to believe the vehicle/pedestrian contains property subject to search, but are
based on the commander’s authority to protect the security of the installation or to protect
government property. During such checks, SF personnel posted atinstallation entry/exit points
are acting, not in their law enforcement capacity, but as sentinelssafeguarding a military
installation and protecting government property. Once a person/vehicle has been identified as
meeting the random criteria, the SF member will identify themselves, inform the person they are
conducting RIEVCs authorized by the 27 SOW/CC and ask the person if they will consent to a
check of their vehicle. If consent is given, further instruction of where the check will take place
and compartments to be opened will be provided. Refusal to submit to a randomly selected check
may subject the individual to debarment from base and/or revocation of on-base driving
privileges and/or disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
2.18. Reserved Parking.
   2.18.1. Initial requests and revalidations for permanent reserved parking slots are submitted
   in letter format with a diagram showing the proposed reserved parking areas and total
   number of parking spaces available. Additionally, justification for spaces other than those
   identified in paragraph 2.18.2.1. below is required. Requests will be routed through 27
   SOSFS/S3L for coordination. Recommendations for approval/disapproval will then be
   forwarded to the Traffic Safety and Coordination Group (TSCG) for final
   approval/disapproval. Once approved or disapproved, the TSCG will return requests to 27
   SOSFS/S3L. When received, 27 SOSFS/S3L will annotate approved/disapproved in the
   Master Reserved Parking Lot Book and return the request to the unit. If approved, the
   requesting unit then submits an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, with a
   copy of the approved request to 27 SOCES to make the appropriate sign(s) and attach them
   to the parking spaces if approved.
CANNONAFBI31-116 6 DECEMBER 2012                                                           19

     reserved spaces will be approved on a case by case basis.
  2.18.3. Temporary reserved parking spaces will be coordinated through Security Forces (27
  SOSFS/S3L), who will provide temporary signs for special events only. No reserved parking
  spaces, permanent or temporary, are authorized without Security Forces’ coordination. 27
  SOCES will provide signs to the 27 SOSFS.

                                          ACCIDENTS

4.1. Definitions. A major vehicle accident is any accident involving a fatality, a personal injury
(evident or claimed), disabling damage requiring towing, hard-to-explain circumstances or
property damage over $10,000.
4.2. Response.
   4.2.1. 27 SOSFS will make detailed accident investigations when estimated damage is in
   excess of $10,000 or disabling damage requires towing. 27 SOLRS will assist with
   government vehicle damage estimates and towing or removal of government-owned and
   privately owned vehicles (POVs) from the accident scene, if requested by 27 SOSFS.
   Normally, the towing of POVs will be limited to removing it from an intersection or street
   into the most available parking lot. NOTE: The on-duty Security Forces flight chief will
   determine if reported minor vehicle accidents require an investigation or a police response.
   4.2.2. Security Forces will respond to off-base traffic accidents only when requested by local
   law enforcement agencies, as approved by 27 SOSFS/DFC. IAW the Posse Comitatus Act
   (18 U.S.C. §1835), Air Force members may not assist local law enforcement agencies in
   enforcing civilian laws; this includes investigation, search, seizure, arrest and similar
   activities. Air Force members may provide assistance in rescuing civilians from danger.
   4.2.3. The responding patrol will give the individual(s) involved in the accident a Freedom
   of Information Act (FOIA) handout with the following Internet address where they can
   request a copy of their accident report: https://www.efoia.af.mil/palMain.aspx. All
   questions regarding FOIA requests will be routed through the 27 SOW/IP office at:
   cannon.foia@cannon.af.mil.
4.3. Investigations and Reports. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports. All POV accidents
require an exchange of information between operators, a detailed blotter entry and the 27 SOSFS
CAFB Minor Vehicle Worksheet. Blotter entries must include operators’ names, unit(s)
(address(es) for non-affiliated civilians), any witnesses to include their unit(s) (address(es) for
civilians) and vehicle descriptions to include year, make, model, color of vehicle and license
plate state and number. The responding patrol will ensure both operators exchange information
