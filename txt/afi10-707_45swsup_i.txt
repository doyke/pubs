SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision updates responsibilities and procedures for managing the AFSIR Program. It provides addi-
tional guidance on how to investigate and report EMI from DOD, non-DOD, and suspected hostile
sources.
(45SW) This revision updates all reporting procedures and associated address elements. This supplement
has been completely revised and should be reviewed in its entirety.


1. Air Force Spectrum Interference Resolution (AFSIR) Program. CJCSI 3320.02B states DOD
components will attempt to resolve interference affecting systems under their auspices at the lowest level
possible within their chain of command. The AFSIR program pertains to Air Force units experiencing
interference at any time except when under the operational control of a Combatant Command. MAJ-
COMs with units located outside of the continental United States may report and resolve interference in
accordance with geographical Unified Command procedures and can request AFFMA or QFIRC assis-
tance, if needed. Report any Air Force interference experienced while supporting joint operations in
accordance with Joint Task Force or Combatant Command procedures. Report interference to space sys-
tems, including space, ground, and control segments to your MAJCOM, in accordance with Air Force
Space Command (AFSPC) supplemental guidance. The focus of the AFSIR program is to resolve EMI at
the lowest organizational level. Submit all reports, initial, follow-on, and closure through the MAJCOM
to AFFMA.
1. (45SW) All initial EMI voice reports will be submitted within 1 hour of the start of the incident. An
EMI written report (applicable Attachment 2 through 8) will be submitted to 45 SW Frequency Manage-
AFI10-707_45SWSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                                     3


ment Office (FMO) (45 SCS/SCXSF) within 20 hours (2-hour point, if space system) of the start of the
EMI. See paragraph 3.6.7. for exceptions to reporting.

2. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). EMI can be caused by enemy, neutral, friendly, or natural
sources, and must be resolved on a case-by-case basis. Users must investigate and report as outlined in
paragraph 3.
2. (45SW) If suspected EMI occurs during a scheduled Eastern Range test or operation, notify the 45th
Space Wing Command Post (45 SW/CP) at 494-7071 (STU III capable). The 45 SW/CP will notify the
CSR Eastern Range Scheduler at 853-5951 and the 45 SW FMO at 494-5860/5837. If the EMI is not
affecting a scheduled range test or operation, the unit experiencing the suspected EMI will notify the 45
SW FMO during duty hours and the 45 SW/CP during non-duty hours. The 45 SW/CP will immediately
notify FMO standby personnel. WARNING: Do not discuss classified information over unsecure lines.
   2.1. EMI from DOD Users. When the EMI clearly results from another DOD user, attempt to resolve
   the interference at the lowest organizational level. After all local efforts have been exhausted to
   resolve the EMI, request assistance through command frequency management channels.
   2.2. EMI from Non-DOD Users. Request assistance through command frequency management chan-
   nels. Do not go directly to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any other agency. Air
   Force-owned equipment may cause EMI that appears to originate from a nongovernment source.
   AFFMA personnel will coordinate with the FCC and other government agencies if the investigation
   shows that non-Air Force equipment caused the EMI.
   2.3. EMI from suspected hostile sources. The primary difference between hostile and nonhostile
   EMI is intention. All incidents should initially be treated as nonhostile EMI until proven otherwise.
       2.3.1. EMI from hostile sources should be reported to the Joint Spectrum Center (JSC) in accor-
       dance with CJCSI 3320.02A-1 (Secret) and by MAJCOMs in accordance with AFPD 10-20, Air
       Force Defensive Counterinformation Operations. Report any hostile interference experienced
       while supporting joint operations in accordance with Joint Task Force or Combatant Command
       procedures. Report Military Satellite Communications incidents to US Strategic Command in
       accordance with AFSPC supplemental guidance.

3. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Resolution.
   3.1. The victim of the interference contacts the local installation spectrum manager (ISM) or other
   point of contact identified by the MAJCOM. Accomplish the following actions prior to requesting
   assistance from the MAJCOM spectrum manager.
       3.1.1. System operator will contact equipment maintenance personnel to determine if the EMI is
       the result of maintenance actions or an equipment malfunction.
       3.1.2. System operator will contact other known nearby units to ascertain if they are experiencing
       the same type of EMI. This may aid in identifying the interference source.
       3.1.3. When co-channel interference (interference between systems assigned similar frequency
       assignments) is suspected, the ISM will attempt to determine the location of frequency assign-
       ments that fall within the bandwidth of the victim receiver.
       3.1.4. If resources are available, system operations and equipment maintenance personnel will
       attempt to determine the bandwidth, relative amplitude, and modulation of the EMI with a spec-
4                                                          AFI10-707_45SWSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


       trum analyzer. Find the approximate bandwidth by varying the receiver frequency to determine
       the affected frequency band.
       3.1.5. If a non-Air Force activity reports suspected interference from an Air Force asset, the vic-
       tim experiencing EMI must collect the related information. The ISM or MAJCOM designated
       point of contact will attempt to resolve the EMI.
       3.1.6. After exhausting all local resolution efforts, the ISM or MAJCOM designated point of con-
       tact can contact the 738th Engineering Installation Squadron (EIS) located at Keesler AFB MS,
       directly for an initial assessment of the problem, obtain consultation, and recommendations
       regarding actions, coordination and techniques that can be used to identify the source and resolve
       the EMI.
       3.1.10. (Added-45SW) System operator will maintain a log of start and stop times of all sus-
       pected interference.
       3.1.11. (Added-45SW) If possible, make a recording of the interference. If this is not possible,
       log what is heard or in the case of radar, what is seen on the scope.
       3.1.12. (Added-45SW) If the EMI is voice, attempt to contact the interfering station to identify
       its location.
    3.2. If resolution is not obtained in accordance with paragraph 3.1., the ISM or MAJCOM designated
    point of contact will request assistance from the MAJCOM spectrum manager. The MAJCOM spec-
    trum manager should use any additional information and tools available to resolve the EMI and should
    request a report as outlined in paragraph 3.6.
    3.3. If the MAJCOM spectrum manager cannot resolve the EMI, request assistance from AFFMA.
    AFFMA will attempt to first coordinate resolution with the MAJCOM and 738 EIS.
    3.4. If resolution is not achieved in accordance with paragraph 3.3., a QFIRC may be required. Coor-
    dinate approval between AFFMA, MAJCOM, and 738 EIS prior to deployment of the QFIRC.
    3.5. AFFMA can also request national-level federal agency and/or JSC support, as appropriate.
    3.6. EMI Reporting:
       3.6.1. Report Precedence. The ISM or MAJCOM designated point of contact and MAJCOM
       Spectrum Management Office will determine precedence consistent with the urgency of the
       reported situation.
       3.6.2. Security Classification of EMI Reports. Units must evaluate the security sensitivity of the
       EMI on the affected system and classify the report accordingly. Security classification of interfer-
       ence incidents/reports is determined principally by nationality and location of the implied or stated
       source of the interference and the security sensitivity of the affected military system. Stations
       located in combat areas or having a sensitive military mission generally must classify all interfer-
       ence reports. Guidelines for classifying interference incidents are contained in CJCSI 3320.02B.
       3.6.3. Report Format. Submit an AFSIR report by electronic means (preferably E-mail). The
       Spectrum XXI [SXXI] Interference Resolution module is a tool that can be used for this purpose.
       Interference reports sent by MAJCOMs will be courtesy copied to the JSC J3 as an information
       addressee for historical record keeping purposes. See Attachment 2 for a sample interference
       report.
AFI10-707_45SWSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                                       5


     3.6.4. Types of Reports.
        3.6.4.1. Initial Report. The ISM or MAJCOM designated point of contact will generate a
        report.
        3.6.4.2. Supplemental or Follow-on Reports. Submit supplemental reports when needed to
        add or modify information previously submitted. Use a supplemental report to request 738
        EIS on-site QFIRC technical assistance.
        3.6.4.3. Closing Reports. The ISM or MAJCOM designated point of contact will submit a
        closing report when the EMI incident is resolved or requires no further action.
     3.6.5. Report Addressees.
        3.6.5.1. Air Force units must submit AFSIR reports through their chain of command up to the
        MAJCOM as the action addressee with info copy to AFFMA NIPRNET affma/do@penta-
        gon.af.mil or SIPRNET affma.do@affma.af.smil.mil and 738 EIS NIPRNET
        738eis.eeem.Chief@keesler.af.mil or SIPRNET 738eis.eee3@keesler.af.smil.mil.
        3.6.5.2. MAJCOMs submit reports to AFFMA NIPRNET affma/do@pentagon.af.mil or
        SIPRNET affma.do@affma.af.smil.mil as the action addressee with info copy to 738 EIS
        NIPRNET 738eis.eeem.Chief@keesler.af.mil or SIPRNET 738eis.eee3@keesler.af.smil.mil
        and JSC NIPRNET operations@jsc.mil or SIPRNET operations@jsc.js.smil.mil.
     3.6.6. During exercise periods, coordinate all EMI reports with the Electronic Warfare Coordina-
     tion Cell (EWCC) in the Air Operations Center or EW Duty Officer. Do not submit an exer-
     cise-related report if jamming or intrusion activities are authorized during an exercise. Depending
     on geographical location, contact the Range Spectrum Manager or Area Frequency Coordinator to
     determine if the interference is an approved part of the exercise.
     3.6.7. Exceptions to Reporting. Do not report an incident when:
        3.6.7.1. The interference is transient EMI from natural sources (e.g., rain, lightning, etc.).
        3.6.7.2. The interference only affects training frequencies assigned on a noninterference basis
        for training purposes.
        3.6.7.2. (45SW) The interference only affects frequencies assigned on a noninterference basis
        for training or other purposes. This includes all FCC part 15 low powered non-licensed
        devices that must accept harmful interference (Ref: CFR 47 Part 15).
        3.6.7.3. Space weather (e.g., HF fades, Polar Cap Absorption (PCA) events, geomagnetic
        storming, etc.) is the suspected, or confirmed, cause of the interference. For assistance, notify
        the local weather unit of the EMI to include date, time, location, system, and frequency
        impacts. The local weather unit can contact the Air Force Weather Agency, as appropriate.
        3.6.7.4. The interference is only experienced aboard intelligence, surveillance and reconnais-
        sance (ISR) aircraft aloft and is localized when mission equipment or payload equipment is
        turned on/off or used. In these cases, the interference must be reported to the flying unit's
        Director of Maintenance/Maintenance Officer and Director of Operations. The unit's Director
        of Maintenance/Maintenance Officer may report the EMI to AFMC; the flying unit's Director
        of Operations must characterize the operational impact. The unit's Director of Maintenance/
        Maintenance Officer must determine if unit maintenance or calibration will resolve the EMI
6                                                          AFI10-707_45SWSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


           before notifying AFMC. If notified, AFMC must determine if any field or depot upgrades
           meant to resolve the EMI are already scheduled. AFMC is responsible for reporting the EMI
           to AFFMA if the EMI can be detected at a distance of more than 50 meters from the aircraft.

4. Requesting Quick Fix Interference Reduction Capability (QFIRC) and Joint Spectrum Interfer-
ence Resolution (JSIR) Assistance:
    4.1. QFIRC. The QFIRC reduces or eliminates unintentional (non-hostile) EMI associated with Air
    Force operational equipment. The QFIRC service analyzes and recommends corrective actions for
    reported EMI problems. The 738 EIS, located at Keesler AFB MS, provides QFIRC to all Air Force
    units. This unit can provide people and equipment to perform on-site direction finding and interfer-
    ence problem analysis. The 738 EIS will document corrective actions and give recommendations for
    solving EMI problems in a formal report that will be forwarded to the requesting unit and to its parent
    MAJCOM and AFFMA.
    4.2. JSIR. The JSC is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the JSIR Program. This program
    office maintains a central database of EMI cases, resolutions, and lessons learned for all DOD EMI
    and provides analytical and on-site assistance in resolving EMI problems. JSIR assistance will be
    requested by AFFMA after all Air Force resources are exhausted.

Electromagnetic environmental effects (E3)—The impact of the electromagnetic environment upon the
operational capability of military forces, equipment, systems, and platforms. It encompasses all
electromagnetic disciplines, including electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic interference;
electromagnetic vulnerability; electromagnetic pulse; electronic protection, hazards of electromagnetic
radiation to personnel, ordnance, and volatile materials; and natural phenomena effects of lightning and
precipitation static. (Joint Publication [JP 1-02])
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)—The ability of systems, equipment, and devices that utilize the
electromagnetic spectrum to operate in their intended operational environments without suffering
unacceptable degradation or causing unintentional degradation because of electromagnetic radiation or
response. It involves the application of sound electromagnetic spectrum management; system,
equipment, and device design configuration that ensures interference-free operation; and clear concepts
and doctrines that maximize operational effectiveness. (JP 1-02)
Electromagnetic interference (EMI)—Any electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or
otherwise degrades or limits the effective performance of electronics and electrical equipment. It can be
induced intentionally, as in some forms of electronic warfare, or unintentionally, as a result of spurious
emissions and responses, intermodulation products, and the like. (JP 1-02)
