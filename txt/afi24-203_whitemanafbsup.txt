the security of the classified asset(s) and must maintain 100% positive control. At no time will
the operator leave the item unattended or beyond line of sight. The operator will proceed
directly to the drop-off point for the package.
4.5. Delivery procedures: Operators will ensure the item is delivered to the correct organization,
as identified by the originator. Upon delivery, the operator will use the         509 LRS/MMF
Classified Receipt Listing to verify the individual receiving the package is authorized to
sign/receive classified materials.
4.5.1. If the receiving individual is not on the Classified Receipt Listing or the authority to

Control Center (VOCC) dispatcher immediately. At no time will the operator leave the package
with someone other than the receiver designated by the originator, unless instructed to do so by
the originator or the VOCC dispatcher. In either case, the new receiver’s authority to receive
classified will be verified using the 509 LRS/MMF Classified Receipt Listing.
4.5.2. After delivery acceptance, a copy of the paperwork (e.g., DD Form 1348-1A, DD Form
1149, DD Form 1907) with the receiver’s name, signature and unit will be retained to provide the

Lading (CBL) and other associated inbound documentation to determine authorized entry. A
representative is required to meet the shipment at the ECP to verify and receive delivery.
5.4.1. (Added) IAW Defense Travel Regulation (DTR) II, Chap 205-29, guards are responsible
for verifying the condition of conveyance seals, as annotated on the CBL, and maintaining
proper surveillance of the shipment.

necessary. IAW DTR II Chap 205-20, “if installation access control directives deem necessary
to remove seals at the entry control points, the activity security representatives will annotate the
reason for removing the seal on the [C]BL.”
5.4.1.2. (Added) Seal numbers affixed to the vehicle which do not correspond with the CBL
suggest tampering and potential security risk; 509 SFS will deny entry to the installation.
5.4.1.3. (Added) Should the CBL/vehicle seals not correspond or if signs of theft, damage or
tampering are evident, an immediate inventory will be performed to determine the extent. 509th
Logistics Readiness Squadron/Cargo Movement Element (509 LRS/LGRDDC) will perform this
inventory.
