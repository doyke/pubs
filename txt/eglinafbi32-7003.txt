                                           Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Concept. This instruction provides a framework for complying with environmental
standards applicable to Hazardous Waste (HW), Universal Waste (UW), Special Wastes (SPW),
and used petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) at Eglin Air Force Base (AFB). It is designed to
provide the Installation Commander the appropriate level of confidence that Eglin AFB is
operating in accordance with the requirements of the applicable HW regulations. Use the
procedures in this instruction to comply with applicable Federal, State, and local standards for
HW, UW, SPW and used POL management.
   1.1.1. This instruction establishes a hazardous waste plan and provides policies and
   procedures for the management of HW at Eglin AFB. It applies to all organizations (host,
   associates, activities, contractors and personnel, but not residential households) that generate
   HW, UW, SPW and used POL within the jurisdiction of Eglin AFB. It is designed to
   identify alternatives to disposing of HW by reducing or eliminating the volume of waste
   generated.
   1.1.2. Environmental Management (96 CEG/CEV) provides technical assistance to all base
   activities regarding proper management of HW, UW, SPW and used POL to ensure
   compliance with federal, state, local regulations, and Air Force instructions. Environmental
   Compliance (96 CEG/CEVC) is the single point of contact to the Florida Department of
   Environmental Protection (FDEP) for all issues regarding HW, UW, SPW and used POL on
   Eglin AFB.
   1.1.3. Any deficiencies or inaccuracies noted in this instruction or difficulties complying
   with this instruction or any HW law or regulation must be reported to Environmental
   Compliance Pollution Prevention (96 CEG/CEVCP).
 6                                                   EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010


                                             Chapter 2

                                 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Management and Control. This instruction provides Eglin AFB with a hazardous waste
management plan which addresses the mandatory HW management requirements of the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP) and United States Air Force (USAF). It covers the control and management of
Hazardous Materials (HM) from the point they become waste to the point of final disposition.
This instruction does not cover radioactive or medical wastes, which are regulated under separate
guidance.
     2.1.1. The installation commander (96 ABW/CC), through subordinate commanders, is
     responsible for installation compliance with HW management and disposal laws and
     regulations. Disposal of HW by the waste disposal contractor or Defense Reutilization and
     Marketing Office (DRMO) does not relieve the installation commander of this obligation.
     2.1.2. The requirements addressed apply to all organizations located on Eglin AFB including
     associates, contractors and units here temporarily. 96 CEG/CEVCP provides for HW
     disposal through the DRMO. Contracting for the disposal or off site transfer of HW without
     the coordination of 96 CEG/CEVCP is prohibited.
     2.1.3. Organizations appoint Unit Environmental Coordinators (UEC), Initial Accumulation
     Point (IAP), 45-Day Accumulation Site (ACCS), Universal Waste (UW) collection site,
     Special Waste (SPW) collection site, and used POL accumulation site managers and
     alternates. A copy of each UEC appointment memorandum shall be submitted to 96
     CEG/CEV. A listing of waste collection site managers and alternates will be maintained in
     the Hazardous Material Management System (HMMS). Organizations will coordinate with
     96 CEG/CEVCP as required to maintain accurate information in HMMS.
2.2. Environmental Management System (EMS) Goals, Objectives and Targets. The
hazardous waste program may be assigned goals, objectives, and targets which must be
measured and reported.
2.3. Basic Structure and Outline. The following outlines the structure of the plan and
incorporates the referenced sections of this instruction.
     2.3.1. Responsibilities. Chapter 3 incorporates the responsibilities of all Eglin military,
     civilian and contractor’s operating at Eglin AFB FL.
     2.3.2. Training.   Chapter 4 includes HW and other related training requirements and

WASTE DETERMINATION, ANALYSIS PLAN AND INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS

5.1. Basic HW Determination/Identification. Any solid, liquid, semi-solid, or contained
gaseous material, which is discarded or abandoned, must be evaluated to determine if it is a HW
and subject to regulation under RCRA.
   5.1.1. A waste is subject to regulation as a hazardous waste if it is not excluded from
   regulation and it exhibits any of the hazardous characteristics specified in 40 CFR 261
   Subpart C (Ignitability, Corrosivity, Reactivity, or Toxicity) or if it is listed in 40 CFR 261
   Subpart D.
   5.1.2. Determination Responsibility. All organizations that generate and/or store potential
   HW are responsible for determining the hazardous characteristics of the waste generated
   and/or stored and the applicability of RCRA requirements. The HW disposal services

   profile sheets is prepared.
   5.3.2. Generators must also provide interim updates if any process changes occur. Waste
   streams should be segregated to as great an extent as practical for a given process. This
   ensures proper packaging, marking, labeling, manifesting, and shipping. Waste segregation
   also aids in recycling efforts.
   5.3.3. Waste profiles and waste collection sites will be numbered sequentially by 96
   CEG/CEVCP as indicated in Table 5.2
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                17

Note: Some existing profiles may be numbered [YY]HM[4-digit sequential #]


   5.3.4. Each initial accumulation point will be assigned only one profile. Generally UW and
   SPW sites will also have only one profile assigned, but the hazardous waste manager may
   make exceptions.
   5.3.5. Organizations and/or UECs shall notify 96 CEG/CEVCP if more than one profile is
   assigned per initial accumulation point.
   5.3.6. If feedback received by the HW disposal services contractor or DRMO indicates the
   generator’s waste identification is incorrect/inaccurate, a verification testing program for
   wastes received from that generator will be initiated. This testing will begin on the next turn-
   in by this generator and will continue until the generator’s identification has been proven
   accurate.
5.4. Hazardous Waste Inventory. The inventory of HW generated is maintained in HMMS.
5.5. Abandoned Waste. Notify your UEC immediately if you find abandoned containers
and/or waste. All unmarked containers are suspected waste. If the organization in the immediate
vicinity cannot confirm the contents of an unmarked container, the organization shall
immediately handle the container as if it is a hazardous waste. This includes marking, labeling,
dating the container, and keeping the container closed except for sampling. The container
contents will be analyzed to determine the appropriate characterization, and the date of sampling
will be marked on the container. Upon receipt of test results, the waste will be characterized and
the appropriate type of site management requirements will be applied.
   5.5.1. Ensure all usable material is stored and marked properly, so that it will not be
   mistaken for abandoned waste.
   5.5.2. It is good practice to mark empty containers being stored for later use as empty.
   Containers being stored shall be stored in a manner that prevents collection of rain water in
   order to avoid the collected rain water being suspected as abandoned waste.

            HAZARDOUS WASTE ACCUMULATION SITE OPERATIONS

6.1. Container Tracking System. A waste and material tracking system has been implemented
through the Hazardous Material Management System (HMMS). All waste containers are tracked
through the Container Number (CN) identified on the waste description label (non-hazardous and
hazardous wastes) provided by the waste disposal services contractor or material item serial
number.
6.2. Types of Storage Areas.
   6.2.1. An accumulation site (ACCS) is an organization’s central accumulation site for
   hazardous waste at which an unlimited amount of HW can be accumulated for up to 45 days.
   Some sites may be authorized up to 90 days.
       6.2.1.1. An initial accumulation point (IAP) is an area at or near the point of generation
       of the waste at which no more than 55 gallons of HW or 1 quart of acute HW can be
       accumulated. Each IAP is authorized to collect a single waste stream. IAPs can be
       established in close proximity to each other, but each must collect a different waste
       stream and be operated as an individual site. If waste generation is intermittent, IAPs can
       be activated and deactivated as mission needs require by coordination between the
       generator, UEC, and 96 CEG/CEVCP.
       6.2.1.2. UW, SPW, and used POL management requirements are described in Chapter 7.
       6.2.1.3. A non-accumulation site (NACCS) is a site where waste is generated only
       occasionally and upon generation is properly collected and moved to an ACCS within 3
       days (72 hours).
6.3. Accumulation Container Management.
   6.3.1. Containers must be in good physical condition.
   6.3.2. Containers accumulating HW, UW, or SPW that do not contain free liquids are
   recommended to be located on a concrete pad, pallet, or other supporting structure that keeps
   the container from contact with the soil.
   6.3.3. Containers that contain free liquids must be placed in an area with secondary
   containment when accumulating HW, UW, or SPW. The containment system must have
   sufficient capacity to contain 10% of the volume of all containers or the volume of the largest
   container, whichever is greater. Special containment pallets are less expensive than building
   dikes/berms and are portable. Note: Aerosol containers and intact battery casings are a
   primary container; the collection drum is considered secondary containment. Any spilled
   material must not be able to flow into a storm drain, sewer, or onto permeable surfaces.
   6.3.4. Containers must not be located near anything with which the waste may be
   incompatible (for example an acid stored next to a caustic). This may be accomplished by
   physically separating the waste containers by means of a dike, berm, wall, or use of a
   containment pallet for each incompatible HW.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                               19


  6.3.5. Adequate aisle space (no less than 3 feet) must be maintained to allow the
  unobstructed movement of personnel and fire protection, spill control, and decontamination
  equipment. Container markings and labels must be visible from the aisle.
  6.3.6. It is a regulatory requirement that accumulation containers must always be kept closed
  unless waste is being added to or removed from the container. For a container to be
  considered closed, fastening rings must be in-place and properly secured. For bung type
  drums, bungs must be closed and capped tight. Containers must not leak if overturned.
  6.3.7. Containers must not be handled, stored, or opened in a manner which may rupture the
  container or cause it to leak.
  6.3.8. The HW disposal services contractor will provide containers approved per DOT
  performance oriented packaging regulations.
  6.3.9. Select the container size that best suits your needs. Do not overfill containers; fill to
  90% capacity.
  6.3.10. The type of waste being accumulated must be identified to ensure container/waste
  compatibility. The container must be compatible or lined with material that is compatible
  with the hazardous waste to be stored, so that the integrity of the container is not impaired.
  6.3.11. Only DOT approved containers will be used for HW, UW, and SPW.
  6.3.12. Containers must be marked and labeled (including DOT) as appropriate for their
  content.
  6.3.13. HW marking labels must contain the following information:
     6.3.13.1. Generator’s name and address; Eglin AFB, DRMO, Building 525,
     Transportation Road Eglin AFB FL, 32542.
     6.3.13.2. ―Hazardous Waste! Federal Law Prohibits Improper Disposal. If found,
     contact the nearest police, public safety authority, or the US Environmental Protection
     Agency (EPA).‖
     6.3.13.3. EPA ID number; ―FL8570024366.‖
     6.3.13.4. The EPA waste code(s), which will vary depending upon the waste. The waste
     code(s) is on the DRMS Form 1930 or HMMS equivalent, HW Profile Sheet.
     6.3.13.5. The DOT Proper Shipping Name (PSN). The PSN is on the DRMS Form 1930
     or HMMS equivalent, HW Profile Sheet.

Figure 6.1. Hazardous Waste Label.




      6.3.13.6. The date and storage time depends on the site type.
          6.3.13.6.1. An IAP has no time limit for accumulation of HW until the container is
          full. The accumulation start date on the label at an IAP should be marked with the
          date that the container becomes full (55 gallons or less). The waste must be moved to
          an ACCS within 3 days of marking the accumulation start date on the full container.
          During the 3-day period, the generator must continue to comply with the conditions
          of Paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4
          6.3.13.6.2. A generator may accumulate any amount of HW in containers at an
          ACCS for up to 45 days. (The High Explosives Research and Development (HERD)
          facility will have up to 90 days to accumulate on site, because their waste is treated at
          Eglin.) Drums placed in a 45-day ACCS will be dated upon entry into the storage
          area unless already dated due to relocation from an IAP.
   6.3.14. If hazardous material products in their original containers are turned into an ACCS as
   a hazardous waste, they may be temporarily stored in the original container provided the
   container is in good condition, is less than 26 gallons, and is marked with the words
   ―Hazardous Waste‖ and dated upon storage. Compatible items may be placed in a container
   marked ―Hazardous Waste‖ and dated. These waste products shall be characterized and
   transferred to properly marked and labeled DOT approved containers at the earliest
   opportunity. The accumulation start date marked on the product container shall be
   transferred to the DOT approved container. Empty product containers shall be recycled if
   possible, or disposed in refuse.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                              21


6.4. Operating Procedures.
   6.4.1. A current listing of approved waste accumulation areas is available through HMMS.
   6.4.2. 96 CEG/CEVCP must approve collection and handling of any waste stream by the
   hazardous waste contractor.
   6.4.3. Storage of more than 55 gallons of HW in a single IAP for longer than 3 days is
   prohibited.
   6.4.4. The UEC will coordinate with 96 CEG/CEVCP to establish, modify, or close an IAP
   or ACCS. CEVCP will authorize the site and enter the site data into the HMMS. The
   following information is required:
      6.4.4.1. Proposed site location (building number, range number, etc.).
      6.4.4.2. A copy of the site-specific spill plan.
      6.4.4.3. Name of primary and alternate site managers, supervisor of site manager, and
      their phone numbers.
      6.4.4.4. Description of waste(s) generated.
      6.4.4.5. Description of the process(s) generating the waste(s).
      6.4.4.6. Appropriate MSDS numbers, MSDS, or product technical information.
   6.4.5. The IAP or ACCS site manager and an alternate are responsible for ensuring that all
   regulatory requirements are met, such as container marking and labeling, training, and
   record-keeping.
   6.4.6. 96 CEG/CEVCP will assign an accumulation site number as described in Table 5.3.
   6.4.7. IAP and ACCS site postings and records requirements are identified in Table 6.1.
   Signs at IAP and ACCS must identify the IAP or ACCS manager, the alternate, their phone
   numbers, and the site identification number. All site records must be maintained for 3 years
   after site closes.

   6.4.8. ACCS inspections will occur and be documented by the ACCS manager or alternate
   weekly. Weekly means there will be a documented inspection at least every 7 days. At a
 22                                                EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010


   minimum, inspection documentation shall include the date and time of the inspection, the
   legibly printed name of the inspector, the number of containers, the condition of the
   containers, a notation of the observations made, and the date and nature of any repairs or
   other remedial actions. Maintain recent (6 months) ACCS inspection checklists at the site.
   Documentation of weekly site inspections is not required at an IAP. However, IAP managers
   should inspect their sites as needed to maintain compliance. Documentation of these
   inspections is recommended but not required.
   6.4.9. It is good management practice for IAP and ACCS managers or alternates to walk
   through the areas daily to ensure containers are closed and are not leaking or handled
   improperly.
   6.4.10. IAPs shall be located at or near the point of waste generation and be under the
   control of the operator of the process generating the waste. ACCSs will be under the control
   of the site manager and alternate. Implement appropriate controls to limit access to
   authorized users.
   6.4.11. Post ―No Smoking‖ signs when there is a hazard from ignitable or reactive wastes.
   Store ignitable or reactive waste no less than 50 feet away from sources of ignition, sparks,
   and the installation boundary. Note: In accordance with AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air Force
   Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard, the transfer of flammable liquids (closed cup
   flash point below 100°F) from one container to another shall be done with containers
   electrically interconnected (bonded).
6.5. Turn-In Requirements and Procedures.
   6.5.1. DRMO is responsible for disposal of all HW/HM except for the wastes identified in
   Table 6.2.
   6.5.2. HW must be turned in before the end of the allowed accumulation time or allowed
   quantity is exceeded.
   6.5.3. All transfers and turn-ins of HW must be conducted under the direction of 96
   CEG/CEVCP and processed through the waste disposal services contractor. Waivers for
   waste transfer and disposal or recycling services must be obtained from 96 CEG/CEVCP
   prior to arranging for and transferring waste to a non-DRMO waste disposal services
   contractor.
   6.5.4. Contact the HW disposal services contractor (882-7664) to initiate the turn-in process.
   The HW services contractor will generate the DD Form 1348-1A.
   6.5.5. Ensure DRMS Form 1930 or HMMS equivalent, HW Profile Sheet accurately
   describes the HW stream, has been updated by 96 CEG/CEVCP and signed by the generator
   (site manager or alternate) within the last 12 months. It is the responsibility of the UEC to
   request waste profile re-authorization from 96 CEG/CEVCP. Chapter 5 provides details on
   waste determination and profiling requirements.
   6.5.6. Unopened or unused serviceable HM that is no longer needed shall be identified to the
   Hazardous Material Cell (HMC) as soon as the material is determined to be excess. Special
   requirements for HM turn-in are described in Paragraph 12.7.
   6.5.7. Empty containers should be recycled through the Eglin Recycling Center when
   feasible. Otherwise, discard empty containers in general refuse.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             23


       6.5.7.1. In order for a container to be considered empty, all material must have been
       removed that can be removed using commonly employed methods (e.g., pouring,
       pumping, or aspirating) and no more than one inch of residue remains on the bottom of
       the container (or no more than 3% of the total capacity by weight of the container
       remains in the container for containers less than or equal to 110 gallons or 0.3% for
       containers of greater than 110 gallons capacity).
       6.5.7.2. If the container held material that was an acute HW (P-listed) when discarded,
       the container must be triple-rinsed using an appropriate solvent capable of removing the
       HW or another method approved by 96 CEG/CEVCP. The container must be marked
       ―TRIPLE-RINSED‖ before it is recycled or discarded. Please note that the material used
       for all three rinse cycles must be captured and managed as a hazardous waste.
       6.5.7.3. If an empty container is to be turned into DRMO, a completed DD Form 1348-
       1A will accompany the property.

   6.6.1. Hazardous material products (i.e. paints, adhesives, cleaners, etc.) that are not
   consumed (or become a waste) through use and are no longer needed or useful to your
   organization shall be returned to the organization’s Issue Point for management in
   accordance with hazardous material turn in procedures per AFI 32-7086, AFMC Supplement,
   and AAC Supplement, Hazardous Material Management, (this includes attempted reuse
   prior to disposal). Determination of the continued usability of the material shall be made at
   the issue point.

  6.6.2. Issue Points shall establish a regular schedule for identifying material that has no
  further use or is no longer serviceable. Excess material and waste determinations shall be
  made in accordance with the schedule.
  6.6.3. For returned material items that become waste, Issue Points shall establish appropriate
  waste collection sites.
     6.6.3.1. Material items that are determined to be a hazardous waste shall be collected in
     an initial accumulation point or managed as an NACCS. Compatible items in quantities
     of one gallon or less in their original undamaged containers, which are closed (will not
     leak), can be collected together in a single waste collection container marked as
     ―hazardous waste‖ and contents (profile) listed as unserviceable material. Containers
     with quantities of greater than one gallon shall be marked directly on the container as
     ―hazardous waste.‖ Leave all original manufacturers labels and the hazardous material
     bar code tracking label on containers. All requirements for managing an IAP apply (keep
     containers closed; do not exceed 55 gallons of unserviceable material). A list of the items
     by NSN, MSDS number, and item name must be maintained and shared with the
     hazardous waste contractor or organization’s central accumulation point as items are
     added to the IAP. This tracking of material to waste is accomplished in HMMS. This
     ensures the waste can be properly characterized and consolidated upon pick-up. At the
     time of pick-up, the hazardous waste container will be dated. The hazardous waste
     contractor or organization’s central accumulation point will characterize, consolidate,
     package, mark, and label the waste for shipment.
     6.6.3.2. An alternative to collecting unserviceable material in the original product
     container is to establish an IAP for a specific hazardous waste stream. Empty the
     contents of the original product containers into the waste collection container as items are
     determined to be a HW that meet the specific waste stream description.
     6.6.3.3. Material items that are determined to be a non-hazardous special waste shall be
     collected in a special waste accumulation point. Compatible items in quantities of one
     gallon or less in their original undamaged containers, which are closed (will not leak),
     can be collected together in a single waste collection container marked as non-hazardous
     special waste and contents (profile) listed as unserviceable material. Containers with
     quantities of greater than one gallon shall be marked directly on the container as non-
     hazardous waste. Leave all original manufacturers labels and the hazardous material bar
     code tracking label on containers. All requirements for managing a special waste
     accumulation site apply (keep containers closed). A list of the items by NSN, MSDS
     number, and item name must be maintained and shared with the hazardous waste
     contractor or organization’s central accumulation point as items are added to the IAP.
     This tracking of material to waste is accomplished in HMMS. This ensures the waste can
     be properly characterized and consolidated upon pick-up. At the time of pick-up, the
     non-hazardous waste container will be dated. The hazardous waste contractor or
     organization’s central accumulation point will characterize, consolidate, package, mark,
     and label the waste for shipment.
     6.6.3.4. An alternative to collecting unserviceable material in original product containers

                                           Chapter 7

 MANAGEMENT OF UNIVERSAL WASTE, SPECIAL WASTE, USED PETROLEUM
          PRODUCTS (POL) AND OTHER SPECIFIC WASTES

7.1. Special Wastes General. Special Waste (SPW) is defined as any waste that requires
handling by the hazardous waste contractor because the generator lacks a method to reuse or
recycle the material. Or, the waste is prohibited from disposal in general refuse or the sanitary
sewer but does not meet the RCRA definitions for hazardous waste, universal waste, or used
petroleum product. A SPW Accumulation Site is an area at which any amount of a specific SPW
can be accumulated.
   7.1.1. SPW Accumulation Site numbers will be assigned by 96 CEG/CEVCP and managed
   in HMMS. Organizations generating SPW must contact 96 CEG/CEVCP to initiate or
   terminate a SPW accumulation site.
   7.1.2. Waste profiles for SPW shall be maintained at the collection site and require annual
   renewal. It is the responsibility of the UEC to request re-authorization from 96
   CEG/CEVCP.
   7.1.3. Paragraphs 6.3.1. through 6.3.12. apply to SPW accumulation and storage.
   7.1.4. SPW sites do not have to be located at the point of waste generation. UECs shall
   review their organization’s non-hazardous special waste collection site needs to minimize the
   management burden by operating the minimum number of SPW sites required to meet the
   organizations mission needs. If waste generation is intermittent, SPW accumulation sites can
   be activated and deactivated as mission needs require by coordination between the generator,
   UEC, and 96 CEG/CEVCP.
7.2. Universal Waste General. Universal waste includes; batteries that exhibit a hazardous
waste characteristic, fluorescent lamps to include all sizes and shapes (e.g. compact fluorescent
lamps, fluorescent tubes), mercury vapor lamps, metal halide lamps, high pressure sodium
lamps, neon lamps, other high intensity discharge lamps containing mercury, and mercury
containing devices.
   7.2.1. A Universal Waste (UW) Accumulation Site is an area at which any amount of a
   specific UW can be accumulated for up to nine (9) months, after which the UW must be
   turned over to the hazardous waste contractor. UW Accumulation Site numbers will be
   assigned by 96 CEG/CEVCP and managed in HMMS. Organizations generating UW must
   contact 96 CEG/CEVCP to initiate or terminate any UW accumulation site.
   7.2.2. Waste profiles for UW shall be maintained at the collection site and require annual
   renewal. It is the responsibility of the UEC to request re-authorization from 96
   CEG/CEVCP.
   7.2.3. UW sites do not have to be located at the point of waste generation. UECs shall
   review their organization’s universal waste collection site needs to minimize the management
   burden by operating the minimum number of UW sites required to meet the organizations
   mission needs. If waste generation is intermittent, UW accumulation sites can be activated
   and deactivated as mission needs require, by coordination between the generator, UEC, and
   96 CEG/CEVCP.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                               27


   7.2.4. Paragraphs 6.3.1. through 6.3.12. apply to UW accumulation and storage.
   7.2.5. Containers or pallets (used for collecting UW) or the UW item shall be marked with
   the date the UW is generated and as described in each respective UW section of this
   document. UW may be collected for up to nine (9) months from the date generated, before
   turn-in.
   7.2.6. The hazardous waste contractor shall manage UW turned in by generating
   organizations. Keeping track of the original accumulation start date, the hazardous waste
   contractor will package the UW for transportation and shipment off installation within twelve
   (12) months of the UW accumulation start date.
7.3. Universal Waste Mercury Lamps and Universal Waste Mercury Devices. All discarded
fluorescent lamps, mercury vapor and high intensity discharge lamps, and mercury containing
devices on Eglin AFB will be handled as UW.
   7.3.1. Mercury containing devices are defined as any electrical product or other device,
   excluding a battery or a mercury-containing lamp, which may release mercury into the
   environment. Examples include: mercury thermostats, electric mercury switches and relays,
   mercury thermometers, mercury manometers, mercury ampoules removed from lamps, and
   other devices that contain liquid mercury as a component necessary for their operation.
   Mercury-containing devices shall be containerized and marked ―Universal Waste Mercury
   Devices.‖
   7.3.2. It is recommended that discarded lamps be stored in their original container.
   Otherwise, store in a container adequate to prevent breakage and compatible with the lamp.
   The container used for collection will usually be turned in with the lamps. Use a separate
   container for each type of lamp. Containerized lamps shall be stored indoors and not be
   exposed to moisture. Bundling the lamps with tape or storage without an adequate container
   is not allowed.
       7.3.2.1. The outside of the container shall be marked with ―Universal Waste Mercury
       Lamps;‖ the date of the first item was collected; and the organizational designator. The
       container shall be kept closed except when adding or removing waste. Closed means
       contents will not spill if the container is overturned. Container flaps may require taping.
       Fill containers completely, when feasible. Excess space allows the tubes to move and
       impact against one another, which can cause breakage.
       7.3.2.2. Handle the lamps in a manner that will prevent breakage. Broken lamps must be
       immediately cleaned-up and placed in a sound closed container (e.g., plastic drum, lined
       box), dated, and marked universal waste mercury lamps. Do not mix broken lamps with
       whole lamps.
       7.3.2.3. Lamps may be turned in at the hazardous waste contractor’s storage facility
       during their regular duty hours, or the contractor will collect them if requested when
       conducting hazardous waste pick-ups. When universal waste mercury lamps are
       transported for turn in to the hazardous waste contractor, they shall remain in the closed
       container marked with date, ―universal waste mercury lamps,‖ and organization code.
7.4. Waste Batteries. Batteries eligible as UW include any battery meeting a characteristic of a
hazardous waste.

   7.4.1. Batteries not eligible as UW include spent lead-acid batteries that are being reclaimed
   (e.g., managed under 40 CFR 266.80 Subpart G and classified as exempted HW) or are not
   HW when discarded (Table 7.1.). Generators of spent lead acid batteries are encouraged to
   arrange an exchange agreement with their battery supplier for return of spent lead acid
   batteries, so that the batteries can be reclaimed rather than managed as a universal waste.

   7.4.2. UW batteries (Table 7.2) and some SPW batteries (Table 7.1) should be recycled or
   disposed of through the hazardous waste disposal services contractor. Contact environmental
   management to establish a waste collection site.
   7.4.3. Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are also considered a special waste battery and shall be
   managed IAW requirements of Paragraph 7.1.
   7.4.4. Commercial-type alkaline batteries (such as sizes AA, C, and D) may be disposed of
   through normal refuse. Each alkaline battery should be disposed of as trash as it becomes
   unserviceable. Do not accumulate or store for later disposal.
   7.4.5. Lithium-Sulfur Dioxide Batteries without a Complete Discharge Device (CDD), spent
   Lead Acid Batteries not being reclaimed (exchanged), and other batteries with hazardous
   waste characteristics shall be collected and managed as a UW or HW.
   7.4.6. UW Batteries or containers used for collection shall be marked ―Universal Waste
   Batteries‖ including the battery type (e.g., Mercury, Nickel Cadmium, Sealed Lead Acid, and
   Lithium), the date of the first item was collected, and the organizational designator.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             29


   7.4.7. Batteries shall be kept dry, away from open flame, heat and combustibles, and in well-
   ventilated areas with temperatures not to exceed 130oF.
   7.4.8. Segregate waste batteries by type and store in separate compatible containers.
   7.4.9. Protect batteries from being damaged, crushed, punctured, or short-circuited. Protect
   batteries from exposure to precipitation.
   7.4.10. Do NOT smoke or eat in battery storage areas or allow these activities.
   7.4.11. Store waste batteries separately from other hazardous wastes and provide secondary
   containment if they contain liquid electrolyte.
   7.4.12. Prior to shipment the Department of Transportation (DOT) requires batteries to be
   packaged in a manner that will prevent short circuits. This means that as batteries are
   accumulated the terminals must be protected from potential short circuit by stacking on non-
   conductive pallets or trays appropriate for shipping. For smaller batteries being accumulated
   in a container, the terminals must be insulated with non-conductive material (e.g., tape over
   terminals).
7.5. Special Instructions for UW Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.
   7.5.1. There are two types of batteries currently available – with and without a CDD. Most
   LiSO2 batteries procured after January 1989 have a CDD. Batteries with a built-in CDD can
   be identified by a label over the switch which reads ―Attention: Before Disposal Remove
   This Label and Push Switch.‖
   7.5.2. Batteries with a CDD. Establish a standard operating procedure (SOP) for LiSO2
   deactivation to include:
       7.5.2.1. Activate the switch in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and
       precautions (e.g., on the information card) and Army TB 43-0134.
       7.5.2.2. ONLY personnel authorized by the shop operating procedure may activate the
       battery CDD prior to disposal.
       7.5.2.3. The battery must not be abused in any way to cause rupture. Vented or leaking
       batteries may release sulfur dioxide gas which is toxic, lithium hydroxide which is
       corrosive and methane gas which is flammable. If vented or leaking, these batteries must
       be managed and disposed of as HW.
       7.5.2.4. Store the deactivated battery for five days to eliminate its reactivity.
       7.5.2.5. A SPW collection site shall be established for deactivated LiSO2 batteries.
       Batteries should be collected in an appropriate container and turned into the waste
       disposal contractor for disposal.
       7.5.2.6. For batteries that show signs of damage (e.g., evidence of overheating, a melted
       plastic case, or a vented cell), complete discharge cannot be ensured. Segregate damaged
       batteries from other batteries. This battery may be classified as HW. Contact 96
       CEG/CEVCP for waste determination. If it is a HW, manage, store, and turn in
       accordingly.
7.6. Aerosol Cans. Aerosol cans require special handling. If you want to avoid complying with
the special handling requirements, purchase and issue materials in packaging other than aerosol
 30                                                EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010


cans. Aerosol cans may be managed and transported as material until they are determined to be a
waste. Issued material including aerosol cans should be returned to the HM issue point for
determination of continued usability. When aerosol cans are returned, the issue point manager
has four options as detailed below.
   7.6.1. Establish an IAP for aerosol cans and place the unpunctured cans in the IAP container
   since the cans are identified as hazardous waste. The waste determination may be made as
   cans are returned or at least once per shift. All requirements for managing an IAP apply.
   7.6.2. Establish an IAP or SPW site for the collection of residual material from punctured
   aerosol cans. If the issue point does not have an IAP for waste aerosol cans, make a waste
   determination for all returned aerosol cans at least once per shift. When an aerosol can is
   determined to be a waste, immediately puncture the waste (empty) aerosol can, collecting the
   residual material in an appropriate waste container. All requirements for managing an IAP or
   SPW site apply. Collect the punctured and drained aerosol cans as scrap metal and turn in to
   DRMO.
   7.6.3. Establish an IAP for aerosol cans and an IAP or SPW site for collection of residual
   material from punctured aerosol cans. Make a waste determination immediately upon return
   of the aerosol can to the issue point. If determined to be a waste, place the waste (empty)
   aerosol can in the IAP container for aerosol cans. Periodically remove waste aerosol cans
   from the IAP container for aerosol cans and immediately puncture the cans draining them
   into the IAP container for aerosol can residual material. All requirements for managing
   IAP/SPW sites apply. Collect the punctured and drained aerosol cans as scrap metal and turn
   in to DRMO.
   7.6.4. Comply with the procedures for unserviceable material, reference Paragraph 6.6.
7.7. Solder. Solder is accepted as scrap metal (recyclable materials) at DRMO. Solder does not
need to be collected or managed as a hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii)). Collection
containers must be marked as recyclable material, scrap metal.
7.8. Rags and Wipers. Rags (also called wipers) contaminated with used oil or solvents may be
a HW when discarded. If determined to be a HW, manage in accordance with the HW
requirements of this instruction. Rags which are laundered after use and returned for reuse are
not solid waste and therefore are not subject to regulation as a HW. They may be used
repeatedly until the end of their useful life.
   7.8.1. Before using a clean rag, decide whether it is usable. Can it wipe up the material and
   be laundered without being destroyed? If not, throw the clean rag away as normal trash.
   7.8.2. If the rag is destroyed during use and has been contaminated with solvents or
   hazardous materials, a waste characterization must be completed.
   7.8.3. It is acceptable for organizations with sanitary sewer service (not septic tanks) to use
   their own washing machines for rags contaminated with POL products, provided they are not
   considered flammable (RCRA Ignitable, D001).
   7.8.4. Laundry service for solvent contaminated rags may also be contracted out, provided
   the laundry service is capable of handling your specific contaminants.
   7.8.5. Disposable rags or paper towels contaminated with solvents or hazardous materials
   may be HW. Follow instructions for HW determination (Chapter 5).
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                31


7.9. Used Filters. Use the following procedures to manage, collect and dispose of filters.
   7.9.1. Used oil/hydraulic/fuel filters must be drained of any liquids they contain. Do not mix
   metal containing oil/hydraulic/fuel filters with gasoline filters or non-metal filters. Each
   container shall be marked with the filter category. For example, used oil filters will be placed
   in a container with the words ―used oil filters.‖ Containers will be kept closed, except when
   adding filters. Containers shall be stored on an oil impermeable surface.
   7.9.2. Drained, used gasoline filters may be classified as HW because of their potential
   ignitability characteristic and benzene contamination. If so, they must be managed IAW the
   HW requirements of this instruction. Contact your UEC for assistance.
    7.9.3. Turn in used oil/hydraulic/fuel filters with metal content at the used oil
    recycling facility, Building 552, Monday through Friday, 1200-1300.
7.10. Compressed Gas Cylinders.
   7.10.1. For disposal of compressed gas cylinders, organizations should contact the waste
   disposal contractor for assistance. Please have the following information available:
   7.10.2. Type of gas in cylinder.
   7.10.3. Size of cylinder (Sizes are: small (equal to or less than 24 inches long), medium
   (more than 24 inches but less than 37 inches long, and large (equal to or longer than 37
   inches)).
   7.10.4. Disposal expenses can be eliminated or significantly reduced by reading the
   complete MSDS and gas supplier’s/manufacturer’s instructions. Many compressed gas
   suppliers/manufacturers will allow a customer to return their products at little or no cost.
   Most fees are for the return shipping/transportation of the cylinders.
   7.10.5. Some types of small cylinders can also be recycled through the waste services
   contractor. The cylinder recycling system removes the sealing sleeve and internal valve stem
   from propane, propylene, map and calibration gas cylinders, and empties and filters
   propellant and allows recycling of the empty cylinder as scrap steel.
7.11. Free Liquid Clarification. If a container has visible liquid or will drip when turned over,
there are free liquids in the container. Free liquids can increase the disposal costs of some waste
streams, such as absorbent pads.
   7.11.1. Containers of used absorbent pads, which contain free liquids when turned in, may
   be rejected. Rejected containers will need to have a HW determination performed. Wastes
   reclassified as HW must be managed in accordance with the HW requirements of this
   instruction.
   7.11.2. Pads should be wrung out as completely as possible prior to placing in the waste
   container. To further reduce the liquid content, dry unused pads may be put in the bottom of
   containers used to collect absorbent pads as they are placed in service.
7.12. Blast Media. Generators must complete a HW determination as described in this
instruction. If the waste blast media is determined to be a HW, follow the HW management
requirements of this instruction.

7.13. Refrigerant Oils. Refrigerant oils are lubricating oils from heat transfer equipment
which, as a result of use, may become contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) present in
refrigerant systems. These oils meet the definition of used oil and are not considered HW, as
long as the following conditions are met:
   7.13.1. The CFC based refrigerants are recovered and reused to the fullest extent possible by
   reclamation.
   7.13.2. The technician has the appropriate certifications for CFC-related recovery, repair,
   and maintenance.
   7.13.3. Used oils are not contaminated with CFCs and are managed in accordance with the
   requirements of this instruction and AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance,
   Eglin AFB Supplement.
7.14. Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs mean any chemical substance that is limited to
the biphenyl molecule which has been chlorinated to varying degrees or any combination of
materials that contain such substances.
   7.14.1. PCB containers must be properly marked with a ―Caution Contains PCBs‖ label and
   a DOT Hazard Class label.

Figure 7.1. PCB Caution labels (choose one).
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             33


Figure 7.2. DOT Hazard Class label.




   7.14.2. Notify 96 CEG/CEVCP of the anticipated generation of PCB-contaminated
   equipment. Depending on the facilities and equipment available, storage may be limited to
   30 days from the date removed from service.
   7.14.3. For facilities and equipment meeting the specific conditions of 40 CFR 761.65(b),
   PCB items may be stored for up to 6 months from the date removed from service.
   7.14.4. Facilities that do not comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 761.65(b) must
   comply with 40 CFR 761.65(c). Storage is limited to 30 days from the date removed from
   service.
   7.14.5. Collect in a cardboard box or metal drum.
   7.14.6. Mark the ―Caution: Contains PCBs‖ label with the date which the PCB item is
   removed from service.
   7.14.7. Under no circumstances shall PCB contaminated equipment (waste) be stored in
   excess of 6 months without the approval from 96 CEG/CEVCP.
7.15. Used POL Products. When generators can no longer beneficially use petroleum, oil and
lubricants (POL), the generator must adhere to the requirements of this section. Used POL
products are not managed as HW but as a recyclable product. Used POL products include
synthetic and standard petroleum products such as hydraulic fluid, transmission fluid, gear oil,
and engine oil. Used POL products may be commingled. Solid greases are not used oil products
and should not be mixed with used oil products. Solid greases are a SPW and should be
collected and turned in through the waste disposal contractor.
   7.15.1. Used POL products may be HW if spilled, contaminated with another HW, or
   rendered no longer suitable for recycling. If determined to be HW, manage in accordance
   with the HW requirements of this instruction.
   7.15.2. Do not mix used POL products with HW or any other non-POL material.
   7.15.3. Used POL storage containers of 55 gallons or greater shall be double-walled or the
   container must be stored on an oil impermeable surface within secondary containment of
 34                                                 EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010


   sufficient capacity to hold 110% of the volume of the largest container within the
   containment area. Containers of less than 55 gallon capacity must use secondary
   containment or be stored on an oil impermeable surface inside a structure.
       7.15.3.1. Mobile used POL containers (bowsers) in use on the flightline are not required
       to be double-walled (but will be if available) or within secondary containment. Spill
       response contingency plans must be in place, and spill control and clean-up supplies must
       be readily available. When there are no aircraft operations or flightline maintenance
       activity in progress, single-walled mobile used POL containers must be returned to a
       storage area with secondary containment. Flightline personnel should periodically
       practice spill response actions. It is important to prevent any spilled oil or fuel products
       from reaching storm water drains.
   7.15.4. Used POL containers shall be closed, covered, or otherwise protected from the
   weather.
       7.15.4.1. Used POL containers shall be in good condition and free of severe rust,
       apparent structural defects, or visible leaks. Discharge of used POL to soils, sewers,
       drainage systems, septic tanks, surface or ground waters, watercourses or marine waters
       is prohibited. If a spill or leak of used POL occurs, immediate response is required to
       contain and clean-up the POL. Organizations must provide for and be prepared with
       adequate materials and procedures appropriate for the quantity and location of used POL
       managed.
   7.15.5. Containers shall be marked ―Used POL‖ or ―Used Oil.‖ Flammable/combustible
   materials shall be located at least 50 feet from sources of ignition.
   7.15.6. Used POL may be accumulated in unlimited quantities and should be turned in to the
   Used Oil Recycling Facility when the container is 90 percent full.
   7.15.7. Generating organizations transport and turn in used POL at the Used Oil Recycling
   Facility on Range Road along with a completed DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt.
   The Used Oil Recycling Facility has limited operating hours of 1200 to 1300, Monday-
   Friday. Used POL that require transporting over public highways shall be limited to fifty
   five (55) gallons per transport vehicle. Bring along appropriate spill response materials
   during transportation. Organizations located outside the main cantonment area may recycle
   used POL through a registered used POL transporter and processor. Consult with 96
   CEG/CEVCP as additional requirements will apply.
   7.15.8. Used oils will be inspected and may be sampled as they are accepted at the Used Oil
   Recycling Facility. Samples will be analyzed for constituents that would make the used oil
   unacceptable for recycling.
7.16. Petroleum Contact Water. ―Petroleum Contact Water‖ or ―PCW‖ means water
containing product. ―Product‖ means petroleum product as defined in Florida Statute Chapter
376. Petroleum product means any liquid fuel commodity made from petroleum, including but
not limited to, all forms of fuel known or sold as diesel fuel, kerosene, all forms of fuel known or
sold as gasoline, and fuels containing a mixture of gasoline and other products. PCW managed
for the recovery of product IAW the management standards of Chapter 62-740 is not a solid
waste as defined in 40 CFR 261.2.

  7.16.1. Examples of materials that meet the definition of PCW include the following:
     7.16.1.1. Condensate from underground and aboveground petroleum storage tanks.
     7.16.1.2. Water bottoms or drawdown water removed from a petroleum storage tank
     system.
     7.16.1.3. Petroleum tank filler sump and dispenser sump water.
     7.16.1.4. Aboveground petroleum tank seal leakage water.
     7.16.1.5. Pumpable liquids from petroleum tank cleaning operations.
     7.16.1.6. Product, or water in contact with product which displays a visible sheen
     contained in spill containment and secondary containment areas associated with
     petroleum tank storage, petroleum transportation, and petroleum distribution systems;
     however, stormwater which displays a visible sheen contained in spill containment and
     secondary containment areas associated with a diesel or No.2 fuel storage tank,
     transportation, or distribution system, is not PCW.
  7.16.2. By definition, Eglin AFB is considered a generator of PCW. A generator that stores
  PCW in containers or tanks shall:
     7.16.2.1. Ensure that the container or tank is made of or lined with material that is
     compatible with PCW.
     7.16.2.2. Keep the container or tank closed and stored in a safe manner.
     7.16.2.3. Label or mark the container or tank clearly with the words ―Petroleum Contact
     Water‖ and the date when the PCW accumulation first begins after the existing PCW in
     the container or tank has been removed.
     7.16.2.4. Not store PCW in containers or tanks for more than 180 days.
     7.16.2.5. Not handle the container or tank in a manner that may rupture it or cause it to
     leak.
     7.16.2.6. Inspect the container or tank for leaks and deterioration at least weekly.
     7.16.2.7. Not mix or commingle PCW with any other material.
  7.16.3. Generating organizations transport and turn in PCW at the Used Oil Recycling
  Facility on Range Road, Eglin Main, along with a completed DD Form 1348-1A. The Used
  Oil Recycling Facility has an isolated tank for PCW, so it is not commingled with the used
  oil. The Used Oil Recycling Facility (882-7744) has limited operating hours. Have
  appropriate spill response materials on hand during transportation.

                                          Chapter 11

               EMERGENCY PLANNING/RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

11.1. Personnel Safety. HW presents a multitude of chemical and physical hazards, which can
harm personnel who come in contact with or are exposed to the materials. If personnel become
aware of these hazards through Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) training and follow the
proper procedures when handling HW, the chance of harm to themselves, other personnel,
property, and the environment is greatly reduced.
   11.1.1. To help determine how toxic a HW is to humans, personnel should become familiar
   with the toxicological terms and exposure values, such as permissible exposure limit (PEL),
   threshold limit value-time weighted average (TLV-TWA), and occupational exposure limit
   (OEL). Bioenvironmental Engineering (96 AMDS/SGPB) can provide further information
   and training on these terms and values.
   11.1.2. Hazardous work areas should be equipped with the appropriate engineering controls
   to reduce and maintain personnel exposure below published acceptable limits, thus
   minimizing the potential harm and hazards of HW. When engineering controls are
   impractical, personal protective equipment may be required. Organizations must provide for
   their own engineering controls or PPE.
   11.1.3. All IAPs, ACCSs, UW sites, and SPW sites must develop site-specific procedures for
   the handling of their unique wastes. These procedures should cover normal day-to-day
   routine, non-routine, and emergency activities.
11.2. Emergency Planning. Site-specific spill plans must cover emergency procedures,
evacuation instructions/routes, and emergency equipment/supplies located at the site.
Organizations must develop a site-specific spill plan (Figure 11.1 is an example) for all ACCS
and IAPs. Tailor the example or create a unique format appropriate for the site/organization
needs. The spill plan details should reflect the risks posed by the material being managed at the
site. A copy of the completed package must be forwarded to 96 CEG/CEVCP when establishing
an ACCS and/or IAP. The plan shall be updated on an ―as needed‖ basis.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             41


Figure 11.1. Sample HW Accumulation Site Spill Plan.




11.3. Emergency Preparedness. The type and amount of equipment needed for emergency
response depends upon the activities being conducted, characteristics of the stored HW, type of
storage facility and surrounding terrain, human and environmental exposures, and capabilities of
emergency responders.
 42                                                  EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010


   11.3.1. ACCSs must be equipped with the following: telephone or radio; alarm system to
   alert personnel who could be affected during an emergency; fire suppression equipment; spill
   control equipment; and decontamination equipment. (40 CFR Part 264.32 and 264.34)
   11.3.2. Generators should maintain a sign with emergency response information,
   communication and alarm systems, fire and spill control equipment, emergency shower, and
   emergency eyewash near their ACCSs and other collection sites.

Figure 11.2. Emergency Response Process Flow for Large Releases of HW.




11.4. Emergency Spill Response Actions. Fires, explosions, releases or spills that present a
potential threat to human health or the environment and/or exceed shop (work area) containment
and cleanup capability should be reported immediately to 911. Shops are expected to cleanup
small spills that occur in their areas. It is very important that shop personnel become familiar
with the area spill plan and the base spill plan to facilitate proper action in the event of a
hazardous substance spill. (40 CFR 262.34(a)(4), 265.51, 264.52).
   11.4.1. Each generating activity, accumulation point, or storage facility will obtain and
   maintain appropriate fire and spill control equipment. Facilities in close proximity may
   maintain one central response kit, as long as it is readily available to all of the organizations.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             43


  Each kit must contain, at minimum, all equipment and materials necessary to contain a spill
  of at least 100 gallons or 100 percent of all wastes stored, if combined amounts are less than
  100 gallons. Small spills may require clay or polypropylene absorbents or neutralizing
  agents (acids and bases) designed for the type of waste you generate. Organizations may
  contact the 96 CEG/CEVC Emergency Response Manager for advice on establishing site-
  specific spill response kits.
  11.4.2. Reports will be filed when any amount is spilled. 96 CEG/CEVC will prepare
  environmental reports to higher headquarters and local, state, and federal agencies. A
  complete report of the incident will be recorded in the operating record of the involved
  facility and submitted to 96 CEG/CEVC.
  11.4.3. The site-specific spill plan shall be posted at each ACCS and IAP. A sign
  identifying the waste monitor/alternate with office telephone number shall be posted at each
  ACCS and IAP.

                                          Chapter 12

                 POLLUTION PREVENTION/WASTE MINIMIZATION

12.1. Pollution Prevention Overview. Pollution prevention (P2) reduces liability risk,
enhances Air Force image in the community, protects public health, and improves worker morale
and participation while reducing operational costs. Waste minimization (e.g., pollution
prevention) is required by RCRA regulation (40 CFR 262 Subpart B and Appendix). The
Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 sets a national policy that uses the following hierarchy of
actions to prevent pollution.
12.2. Source Reduction. The primary means to accomplish P2 is to reduce or eliminate
dependence on HM and reduce waste streams by process modification or material substitution.
   12.2.1. Some examples are: Ordering and using only the amount of material needed; using a
   different stripping method, such as high-pressure water jet in lieu of chemicals; utilizing
   aqueous parts washers to eliminate the use of solvents such as PD-680; good operating
   practices to reduce loss due to mishandling or improper storage of HM, as well as
   minimizing spills, leaks, and accidents; donating open/unused portions of HM to other
   organizations that utilize the same materials; determining if materials have received a shelf-
   life extension; donating unused/unopened expended shelf-life items to an organization
   requiring the material for less critical process or to DRMO for resale/reutilization; and
   segregating non-HW from HW to prevent generating unnecessary HW.
12.3. Reclaim/Recycle/Reuse. If source reduction is not possible, reuse or recycle all possible
material on base, when economically feasible.
12.4. Treatment. Any material that cannot be replaced, recycled or reused should be treated (at
a RCRA Subtitle C permitted facility) in such a way that it can be disposed as a non-HW or that
the volume of HW has been minimized to its greatest potential. This includes volume reduction,
neutralization, detoxification, incineration, and scrubbing.
12.5. Disposal. The last resort is to dispose of the HW in a RCRA Subtitle C permitted facility
where it can be properly isolated through encapsulation or embedding.
12.6. Pollution Prevention Program.
   12.6.1. In an effort to reduce HW, the Pollution Prevention (P2) Branch of Environmental
   Management (96 CEG/CEVCP), 96 AMDS/SGPB, and the Hazardous Material Cell (HMC)
   located in Base Supply apply procedures to evaluate processes and foster alternatives to
   hazardous practices. Our P2 program consists of spending time in the process areas and with
   the personnel who perform the process. With the help of supervisors and the craftsmen and
   women who work in the shops, assessments are performed on the processes responsible for
   using HM and/or generating HW. They focus on areas that offer technically and
   economically feasible P2 opportunities.
   12.6.2. Once the assessments are complete and the options weighed, the chosen solution
   requires funding. Funding from the P2 budget may be available to ―seed‖ P2 activities, such
   as Material Substitution; New Process Technologies; Process Modifications; and Recycling.
EGLINAFBI32-7003 1 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            45


12.7. Excess Material Redistribution and Control. The HM Management Program (HMMP)
attempts to redistribute all usable excess HM as a customer service to host and associate
organizations on Eglin AFB to facilitate use/reuse of HM to the maximum extent possible before
turning materials in to the DRMO. The following instructions are implemented to facilitate
reduction in the quantity of HMs becoming HW.
   12.7.1. Hazardous Materials Management System (HMMS) provides a tracking mechanism
   in which a serialized bar coded label is placed on each HM container. The label serial
   number is linked to information on the container contents [National Stock Number (NSN),
   MSDS and Expiration Date]. The HM container is then tracked in the computer system by
   serial number as it is distributed to the HM Distribution Service Centers (HDSCs) or Issue
   Points (IP) and end users.
       12.7.1.1. Issue Point Manager’s (IPM) Responsibilities. IPMs are responsible for
       managing all HM for the shops that they service. One of the IPM’s goals is to maintain
       minimum HM stock levels to meet work requirements. The IPM performs the following
       steps.
          12.7.1.1.1. Reviews material inventory for excess and shelf-life expiration date of
          material from the HMMS and container information.
          12.7.1.1.2. Determines if the shelf-life can be extended by reviewing the Tasking
          Order requirements and contacting the HMC for extension information.
          12.7.1.1.3. Notifies the HMC of excess material and requests it be advertised through
          the HMMS home page or by email to Issue Point Managers.
       12.7.1.2. HMC/IP Responsibilities. If the material can be transferred between the IPs,
       the transferring IP notifies the HMC. After all authorization requirements are met, the
       HMC will approve and notify both IPs of the transfer.
       12.7.1.3. Advertises the excess material in the HMMS until a new user is found or the
       IPM determines the material must be turned in to the DRMO for redistribution, resale,
       recycling, or disposal in accordance with DRMO regulations. The material will remain
       physically located at the original IP (owning IP) and will be under the complete control
       and responsibility of the IPM until the material is used or goes to DRMO. Material
       should not be retained more than 90 days, unless a new use can be verified and
       documented.

                              PUBLIC AFFAIRS PLANNING

13.1. Environmental Public Affairs Overview. Experience shows that the public often
misunderstands Air Force actions. Public relations problems usually remain long after the actual
incident. Eglin AFB must be prepared to effectively meet the challenge of providing timely,
accurate information to the general public concerning HW management or pollution incidents.
The most important aspect involves personal contact and coordination between the Public Affairs
Office (96 ABW/PA) and other agencies to ensure clear communication during an actual HW
emergency response.
13.2. Hazardous Waste Media Queries. Queries may address the base’s notification to the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of HW activity, application for permits to operate
treatment, storage or disposal facilities, procedures for disposition of certain HM and HW, and
emergency response incidents. The procedures for handling all media queries pertaining to
any/all aspects of HW are as follows:
   13.2.1. Anyone receiving a query from a media representative will direct the inquiry to 96
   ABW/PA and will immediately notify 96 ABW/PA of the contact.
   13.2.2. 96 ABW/PA will coordinate the release of any information to the media with the 96
   CEG/CEVC, AAC/JAV, and the affected organizations.
   13.2.3. Any HW incidents with a potential for impact on the surrounding communities or a
   potential for public controversy will be reported to 96 ABW/PA and 96 CEG/CEV for review
   and media notification as appropriate.
