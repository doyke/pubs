                                                Chapter 1

                                               PURPOSE

1.1. General. The AOC is organizationally aligned to a Numbered Air Force or War Fighting Headquar-
ters (WFHQ). This instruction establishes the general requirements of the AOC standardization and eval-
uation (STAN/EVAL) program.

1.2. Purpose. This instruction identifies the objectives, organization, and responsibilities of the AOC
STAN/EVAL program, and provides administrative procedures. The long-range goal of the AOC STAN/
EVAL program is to mirror more robust flying and command and control (C2) weapons system programs
that currently exist throughout the USAF. Given current AOC peacetime manning constraints, the AOC
STAN/EVAL program will be implemented in two phases. This instruction implements phase one. This
phase has two parts leading to completion of mission qualification training (MQT) and being recognized
by unit commander (CC) as combat mission ready (CMR). To gain recognition by the unit CC as CMR,
individuals must complete a positional or functional area certification based upon positional/functional
area training with oversight provided by unit training manager and AOC division/team leads. Secondly,
individuals must complete a formal written evaluation (examination) conducted by AOC STAN/EVAL
based on the AOC master question file (MQF). The next phase will bring the AOC weapons system from
positional/functional area training certification to formal STAN/EVAL positional evaluation. To begin
implementation of phase two, this instruction will be reviewed and rewritten two years from the publica-
tion date on page 1. AOC units will provide supplements to this instruction in accordance with (IAW)
Chapter 6, outlining unit-specific STAN/EVAL policies and procedures. Requirements beyond those
defined by this instruction are at the sole discretion of the unit/group commander.

1.3. Applicability. This instruction applies to commanders, supervisors, and personnel assigned to a Fal-
coner/Tailored AOC as well as, 152 Air Operations Group (AOG), 157 AOG, 112 Air Operations Squad-
ron (AOS), 701 Combat Operations Squadron (COS), 710 COS, 601AOG, 15 Air Mobility Operations
Squadron (AMOS), and 21 AMOS. Functional AOCs (such as TACC and AFSPC) will operate their sys-
tems consistent with the guidelines contained in this AFI and applicable MAJCOM supplement, and will
align their STAN/EVAL function under an appropriate organizational element, responsible to the com-
mander. Publication, implementation, and review of this instruction must be performed IAW appropriate
USAF and MAJCOM directives.

1.4. Objectives. The overall objective of the AOC STAN/EVAL program is to standardize procedures
and provide commanders with a tool to validate mission readiness and provide meaningful indicators
reflecting division/team and overall unit qualifications, capabilities, and effectiveness. Specific program
objectives are to:
    1.4.1. Develop, evaluate, and ensure standardization of AOC operational procedures.
    1.4.2. Assess unit effectiveness and ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and
    administrative directives.
    1.4.3. Evaluate and revise operational directives, procedures, and techniques as required.
    1.4.4. Provide the beginnings of a system to assess and document individual knowledge, proficiency,
    and capability to accomplish assigned AOC duties.

                 UNIT AOC STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. The current AOC organization identifies the air operations group (AOG) commander as the
AOC Director. Under the WFHQ construct, this individual will continue to fill this position in the AOC.
Thus, the AOG/CC has the overall responsibility for establishing the STAN/EVAL function within his/her
AOC organization. Also in today’s organizational structure, some units have an air intelligence group
(AIG). The AIG/CC will be responsible for establishing the STAN/EVAL function for intelligence per-
sonnel. The AIG/CC will work closely with the AOG/CC to ensure his/her program is aligned with
guidelines established by AOG/CC. Communications personnel assigned to support the AOC will utilize
quality assurance program outlined in AFI 33-115, Volume 2, and AFSC Job Qualification Standards.
Squadron and smaller units not associated or part of a group such as the 112 AOS, 701 COS, 710 COS, 15
AMOS, and 21 AMOS, will establish a STAN/EVAL function under the unit CC and for the purposes of
this AFI will be included in term “group” when used below. AMC/A31, AFSOC/DOH, and AFSPACE/
XOT will be responsible for establishing STAN/EVAL function for AOCs under their control, as well as
any forces they provide to an AOC as enablers or increase in AOC capabilities.

3.2. STAN/EVAL(OGV/INV/etc.) Responsibilities. The conduct of the AOC STAN/EVAL program is
directed by and resides under the supervision/responsibility of the commander.
    3.2.1. Group Commander Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Establish a unit STAN/EVAL function to perform the duties directed by this instruction
       and applicable MAJCOM supplements. The CC may establish a single STAN/EVAL function at
       the group level, designate subordinate unit/CC’s to establish this function within their units, or
       have a combination of both.
       3.2.1.2. Ensure materials provided are accurate and current.
       3.2.1.3. Direct evaluations to maintain a quality force.
       3.2.1.4. Direct supplementary evaluations and individual qualification downgrades as necessary.
       3.2.1.5. Designate unit STAN/EVAL managers or evaluators in writing.
       3.2.1.6. Approve and designate individuals as CMR. (NOTE: Group CCs may delegate this to
       squadron commanders).
    3.2.2. Unit STAN/EVAL Function Responsibilities: Emphasize the process of standardization
    across AOC functions where applicable. Unit STAN/EVAL will:
       3.2.2.1. Establish and implement procedures for the evaluation program IAW Chapter 4, Evalu-
       ations. Document the evaluation program IAW Chapter 5, Evaluation Documentation.
       3.2.2.2. Develop and coordinate local MQF as appropriate.
           3.2.2.2.1. Coordinate and submit required local and CAF MQF inputs with assistance from
           subordinate teams and cells. Each AOC division will submit a minimum of 50 MQF questions
           focusing on unit mission/theater specific processes, skills, and knowledge items. These ques-
           tions will become the standardized local MQF.

                                           EVALUATIONS

4.1. General. The initial phase of the AOC STAN/EVAL Program requires positional/functional area
certifications conducted under the unit training program and written evaluations/examinations to ensure
qualification of personnel. Written evaluations/examinations are conducted by STAN/EVAL to ensure
AOC personnel obtain the depth of academic knowledge required within their respective division/team/
functional area positions in order to proficiently perform AOC duties. Written evaluations/examinations
are required for all AOC members to attain and maintain CMR status. Positional/functional area evalua-
tions are not required as part of the unit STAN/EVAL program at this time; however, a separate ‘posi-
tional/functional area certification process at the division, team or functional area level for all AOC
member positions is required as part of the evaluation process and recommendation for CMR status. The
division chief is responsible for ensuring positional/functional area certifications are conducted and
results reported to the training office. Commanders have the authority and are encouraged to develop
additional unit or positional/functional area evaluations. Document unit specific evaluation requirements
in the unit supplement to this instruction.

4.2. Evaluations. Phase 1 of the AOC STAN/EVAL program consists of four types of evaluations for
AOC personnel: IQE, MQE, and RQE. Additionally, provisions exist for commanders to evaluate and
certify specific performance through optional SPOT evaluations. The guidance and procedures, if used,
will be documented in the unit supplement to this instruction. Re-Evaluations are covered in AFI
13-1AOC, Volume 1, AOC Training.
   4.2.1. Initial Qualification Evaluation/Examination. IQE is based on either students passing aca-
   demics in the 505 TRS AOC Formal Training Unit (FTU) and getting a positional/functional area cer-
   tification from the FTU for IQE or passing local commander approved initial qualification training
   (IQT) program. Upon completion of the FTU syllabus, and satisfactory participation in the end of
   course exercise, the AOC member is awarded a special experience identifier (SEI) and is certified as
   basic qualified (BQ). Members completing in-house commander approved IQT program will be
   awarded SEI in accordance with guidance in AFMAN 36-2108.
   4.2.2. Mission Qualification Evaluation/Examination. All assigned AOC personnel will complete
   an MQE for their primary assigned duty position/functional area after completing MQT.
       4.2.2.1. The MQE written evaluation/examination is administered after a crewmember has com-
       pleted the MQT syllabus, and has been position/functional area certified by another CMR team
       member on all MQT positional/functional area requirements IAW the unit supplement to this AFI
       and division/team chief or flight commander approval. AOC Communications Operations and
       AOC weapon system (WS) help desk personnel will task certify IAW AFI 33-115 Volume 2, and
       AFSC crew position requirements identified by AFSC Job Qualification Standards, i.e., AFJQS
       3C0X1-230F, Theater Battle Management Core System-Force Level and AFJQS 3CXXX-200C,
       Position Certification for Network Professionals. Communications-Electronics Maintenance
       (AFSC 2EXXX) personnel will task certified IAW AFI 21-116, Maintenance Management of
       Communications-Electronics and associated AFJQSs.
       4.2.2.2. Upon completion of MQT, STAN/EVAL will administer the MQE written evaluation/
       examination, which will consist of an open and closed book test. MQE written examination ques-
12                                                                    AFI13-1AOCV2 1 AUGUST 2005


        tions will be drawn from the standardized CAF, MAJCOM (if required), and local MQFs. Test
        procedures are outlined in Chapter 4, para 4.4.
        4.2.2.3. Upon successful completion of the MQE the individual will be certified as CMR by the
        unit Commander.
     4.2.3. Recurring and Requalification Evaluations/Examinations. Recurring evaluations are con-
     ducted when an individual reaches his/her window as outlined in AFI 13-1AOC Vol 1. RQEs are
     administered for one of two reasons: to recheck an individual who failed an MQE or RQE; or follow-
     ing loss of qualification due to commander- or supervisor-directed downgrade (see Chapter 4, para
     4.4.8.5.).
        4.2.3.1. The RQE for requalification and directed downgrade includes both a positional/func-
        tional area certification and a written evaluation/examination. The written evaluation/examina-
        tion consists of an open and closed book test. Recheck of individuals who failed an MQE written
        eval/exam will be written evaluation/examination only.
        4.2.3.2. RQE written evaluations/examination questions will be drawn from standardized CAF,
        MAJCOM, and local MQFs.
        4.2.3.3. Successful completion of an RQE will update an individual’s evaluation due date as out-
        lined in Chapter 4, para 4.4.9. The commander will re-certify the individual as CMR.
     4.2.4. SPOT Evaluations. SPOT Evaluations are conducted at the discretion of the unit commander,
     director of operations or equivalent, or STAN/EVAL or Q/A chief. SPOT Evaluations are conducted
     to ensure discrepancies noted in MQE were corrected or to spot check an individuals proficiency.
        4.2.4.1. SPOT Evaluations consist of individual evaluations. Spot evaluations must adhere to
        same standards outlined in this AFI for all evaluations. Commanders and unit STAN/EVAL will
        develop unit unique performance standards for any unit mission related tasks to be evaluated and
        identify requirements in the unit supplement to this instruction.
        4.2.4.2. Document SPOT evaluations in the learning management system (LMS) or with other
        locally developed forms and maintain electronically or in the individual’s training record.

4.3. Personnel Status.
     4.3.1. Basic Qualified. Basic qualified (BQ) is the qualification level awarded to an AOC crewmem-
     ber who has satisfactorily completed IQT IAW AFI 13-1AOC Vol 1 and an IQE IAW paragraph 4.2.1.
     Individual is not ready to perform duties required by Unit’s mission. The crewmember must meet the
     minimum IQT academic and performance standards set forth by the AOC FTU or, for those not
     attending FTU, Commander approved IQT standards established by unit. BQ is not a long-term train-
     ing status nor does it imply position-specific expertise; trainees must progress to MQT to improve and
     attain proficiency on positional/functional area duties and tasks.
     4.3.2. Combat Mission Ready. Combat mission ready (CMR) is the qualification level awarded to
     an AOC crewmember who has satisfactorily completed MQT, successfully accomplished an MQE
     and been given CMR status by the unit commander. These crewmembers have been positional/func-
     tional area certified and are deemed proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned
     AOC crew position. All AOC crewmember UTC-coded positions (X1, X5, M1-M8, and 7FVMA) are
     designated CMR positions. To retain CMR status, crewmembers must complete all continuation train-
     ing requirements IAW AFI 13-1AOC Vol 1 or AFI 33-115, maintain proficiency and qualification in
AFI13-1AOCV2 1 AUGUST 2005                                                                             13


   all core missions of the AOC unit to which they are assigned, and maintain qualification via recurring
   evaluations as prescribed in Chapter 4, paragraph 4.2.3.
   4.3.3. Non-Combat Mission Ready. Non-combat mission ready (NCMR) is a regressed qualifica-
   tion level status of an individual who has failed to maintain CMR. See paragraph 4.4.8. for re-exam-
   ination and restrictions policies. Individuals may be regressed for one of the following reasons:
      4.3.3.1. Does not complete annual continuation training requirements.
      4.3.3.2. Fails a written examination during a recurring evaluation.
      4.3.3.3. Fails to complete a recurring evaluation by the scheduled due date without unit com-
      mander’s waiver as identified in Chapter 4, para 4.3.9.4.
      4.3.3.4. The unit commander, division chief, team chief, or individual’s supervisor determines
      member to be non-proficient. (see Chapter 4, para 4.4.8.5.).
   4.3.4. Unqualified. Unqualified (UQ) is the qualification level of an individual who is not qualified
   to perform AOC duties. The UQ status applies to an individual who has:
      4.3.4.1. Not yet completed IQT training requirements and/or successfully completed IQE for BQ
      status.
      4.3.4.2. Been downgraded at the direction of the commander. (see Chapter 4, para 4.4.8.5.).
      4.3.4.3. Failed an initial or recurring evaluation.
      4.3.4.4. Failed to complete a recurring evaluation prior to the end of an eligibility period.

4.4. Examination Procedures.
   4.4.1. Program Documentation. Document local examination procedures in the unit supplement to
   this instruction.
   4.4.2. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets or computer records
   for at least 3 months, or until documented IAW Chapter 5.
   4.4.3. Examination Question Review. STAN/EVAL will review all MQFs and exams for accuracy
   annually and after any changes in source documents. Units will document their procedures for
   reviewing and updating MQFs and prepared exams in the unit supplement to this instruction.
      4.4.3.1. Unit STAN/EVAL functions as outlined in unit/group supplements to this AFI, will
      develop and control written examinations for each division, team, cell, functional area, or duty
      position, as applicable. However, when different duty positions are responsible for identical infor-
      mation, a single examination will suffice.
      4.4.3.2. Unit STAN/EVAL will maintain two tests on file for each team, cell, functional area, or
      duty position as determined by division chief and ensure that no more than 50% of the questions
      are duplicated between tests.
      4.4.3.3. Units using computer-generated examinations do not need to maintain the examinations
      referenced above provided the following restrictions are observed:
          4.4.3.3.1. Individual examinations are randomly generated from the standardized MQF.
14                                                                   AFI13-1AOCV2 1 AUGUST 2005


            4.4.3.3.2. Re-examinations are constructed so that duplication of questions is kept to a mini-
            mum.
     4.4.4. Test Security. STAN/EVAL personnel, as outlined in unit/group supplements to this AFI, will
     maintain positive control of all tests, applicable answer sheets, and associated computer based/elec-
     tronic media.
     4.4.5. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for examinations is 85 percent. The
     minimum passing score for communications support personnel assigned to AOC Network and AOC
     WS help desk functions is 70 percent due to the industry standard and associated quantity, complexity,
     and level of system engineering level challenges.
     4.4.6. Type of Tests.
        4.4.6.1. Open Book Tests. Open book test questions will come from publications made available
        to the individual during testing. Open book questions will contain information pertinent to overall
        AOC operational procedures as described in AF/MAJCOM/unit directives, AFOTTP 2-3.2, or
        other documents from the unit’s read file. Each unit may develop an open book secure question
        bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the open book test questions. Do not dis-
        tribute the SQB to personnel and safeguard it in the same manner as any other required STAN/
        EVAL examination. The open book test will consist of a minimum of ten questions.
        4.4.6.2. Closed Book Tests. Closed book questions will come from the CAF and theater/local
        MQFs. These questions will emphasize crewmember division, team, cell, functional area, posi-
        tional knowledge and information essential to mission accomplishment. The closed book test will
        consist of a minimum or 20 questions and a maximum of 100 questions. 70 percent of the ques-
        tions will come from the CAF MQF and 30 percent from the theater/local MQFs. See MAJCOM
        supplement for further guidance. All questions will be directly related to the AOC member’s
        crew, division, functional area duties, general knowledge, and unit theater/mission tasking and
        come from AF, MAJCOM, Unit directives, AFOTTP 2-3.2, or other documents from the unit’s
        read file.
     4.4.7. Master Question File. As the lead MAJCOM, ACC will ensure standardized CAF MQFs con-
     tain approved questions for testing. MAJCOMs will ensure theater/mission specific MQFs are avail-
     able for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable AOCs. At the unit level, the unit STAN/EVAL
     is responsible for maintenance and oversight of the MQF. The MQF will be made available to unit
     training personnel to facilitate IQT/MQT training.
        4.4.7.1. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as neces-
        sary. Units may edit MAJCOM MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures, administrative
        errors, and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational procedures; however, subject mat-
        ter may not be changed. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
        4.4.7.2. MQF questions will be multiple choice or true/false. They will contain the appropriate
        reference for validation. Until able to place in LMS, ACC/DOYC will maintain copies the MQF
        on the ACC/DOY web site (https://totn.acc.af.mil).
     4.4.8. Failure to Pass. A written exam will not be complete until all failed items have been success-
     fully re-accomplished.
AFI13-1AOCV2 1 AUGUST 2005                                                                            15


     4.4.8.1. Reexamination Policy. An individual failing a required test must be afforded an ade-
     quate study period of a minimum of 24 hours prior to reexamination. The individual will be
     reevaluated using an alternate exam.
     4.4.8.2. Reexamination Period. Individuals who fail a required test must complete a successful
     reexamination within 30 days (ARC 3 months) following the date of the failure. The unit com-
     mander has waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination.
     Document such waivers with a memo for record placed in the individual training record.
     4.4.8.3. Additional Training. Following a failed examination, an evaluator will make additional
     training recommendations electronically or in writing to the unit training manager to assist in
     eliminating any deficiencies identified during an examination. Additional training may include
     self-study, instruction, use of a computer based training program, or an event.
     4.4.8.4. Restrictions.
        4.4.8.4.1. Crewmembers who fail MQE/RQE written evaluations/exams after the second
        attempt will be regressed to NCMR. Based upon recommendation of the evaluator or quality
        assurance person, training manager, and supervisor, the unit CC may allow the individual to
        continue AOC duties under supervision or take appropriate action to remove individual from
        the weapons system. If the unit CC allows resumption of duties under supervision, the indi-
        vidual must pass the next written evaluation/examination. If a third failure occurs, the unit CC
        will take appropriate action to remove individual from the weapons system.
        4.4.8.4.2. Restrictions should address the specific task or event that requires supervision until
        successful retraining is completed. Restrictions are not punitive, but designed to enhance per-
        formance and proficiency.
        4.4.8.4.3. Specific restrictions will be documented in crewmember’s training folder.
     4.4.8.5. Commander-Directed Downgrade. The unit CC may direct a downgrade of an AOC
     crewmember to NCMR or UQ status if he/she deems circumstances warrant it.
        4.4.8.5.1. Reasons for downgrades to UQ status may include, but are not limited to, repeated
        evaluation or continuation training failures, recurring failures to meet training or evaluation
        suspenses, failure to maintain necessary security clearance, etc.
        4.4.8.5.2. Such downgrades should be taken in consultation with individual’s supervisor as
        well as STAN/EVAL and the unit training manager when appropriate.
        4.4.8.5.3. MAJCOM and/or unit supplements to this instruction will include guidance for
        downgrade processes and documentation. All documentation of downgrades will be main-
        tained in crewmember’s training folder.
  4.4.9. Timing of Qualification Evaluations
     4.4.9.1. MQE. Complete this evaluation within 30 days (ARC 3 months) after the unit training
     manager has certified an individual's MQT is complete. After the crewmember passes written
     evaluation/exam, STAN/EVAL notifies the training office. The training manager will forward
     CMR recommendation to the unit commander for approval.
     4.4.9.2. RQE. Required recurring evaluations expire after 17th month (ARC 36 months). For
     example, an individual’s Mission Evaluation occurs in Jan 2004, the individual enters continua-
16                                                                  AFI13-1AOCV2 1 AUGUST 2005


       tion training, the eligibility window for the individual’s periodic check begins in Jan 2005, and
       certification expires in Jul 2005. See Chapter 4, Table 4.1., Eligibility Window and Expiration
       Date Timelines. For Korea, RQE for personnel on remote assignment is waived.

   4.5.1. Satisfactorily complete unit/theater specific MQT requirements directed by the gaining MAJ-
   COM and the unit.
   4.5.2. Satisfactorily complete the STAN/EVAL written evaluation/examination.
   4.5.3. Be approved for CMR by unit CC.

4.6. Positional/Functional Area Certifications.
   4.6.1. Positional/functional area certifications will be conducted as outlined in the unit supplement to
   this AFI and approved by unit CC. Normally this certification will be conducted by a team/division
   member qualified CMR in the particular duty position.
   4.6.2. For future development of STAN/EVAL checklists, individuals conducting positional/func-
   tional area certifications will use locally produced positional/functional area certification checklists
   for the duty position, team, or functional area. Locally produced checklists will be forwarded to ACC/
   DOYC for CAF units or AMC/A31 for MAF units through appropriate channels for posting to the
   DOY web site. As the AOC lead, DOYC will review all locally produced checklists and use these to
   begin development of CAF standardized checklists. Publication of standardized certification check-
   lists will follow normal AFI development, coordination, approval, and publication process.
   4.6.3. Positional/functional area certifications should be accomplished before the MQE. Positional/
   functional area certifications should be conducted by someone other than the crewmember’s primary
   trainer.
   4.6.4. Upon completion of the certification process, the certifier will forward results of the certifica-
   tion and identify additional training recommendations electronically or in writing to the unit training
   manager. The unit training manager will then notify the STAN/EVAL that the crewmember is ready
   for the MQE.
   4.6.5. Specific unit positional/functional area certification procedures and criteria, to include failures
   and recertifications, will be outlined in the unit supplement to this instruction.
   4.6.6. Positional/functional area certification will be conducted within 30 days (ARC 3 months) after
   the unit training manager has identified an individual's MQT as complete.

                                  EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

5.1. Scope. Administration of the STAN/EVAL program requires accurate documentation. Units will
outline local documentation procedures in the unit supplement to this instruction.

5.2. Format. Computer generated forms or databases may be used to record test scores and cumulative
evaluation results. Hardcopy folders or files may also be used.

5.3. Requirements.
     5.3.1. BQ Certification. Upon completion of IQT, the 505 TRS will document BQ status on the
     appropriate form within LMS and forward documentation to the unit training manager. Units con-
     ducting in house IQT will be responsible for documenting BQ in LMS.
     5.3.2. CMR Certification. Upon completion of MQE and approval of unit CC, the training manager
     documents CMR certification in the individual’s training folder, CAMS, or on the appropriate form
     within LMS, as appropriate.
     5.3.3. The unit STAN/EVAL function will centrally maintain and document the following written
     evaluations/examinations:
        5.3.3.1. Results for all crewmembers.
        5.3.3.2. History for all crewmembers to include types of written evaluations and completion
        dates.
        5.3.3.3. Trend analysis for at least 2 years.

5.4. PCS of Individual.
     5.4.1. Members will normally have an electronic copy forwarded and/or hand-carry their training
     records to the gaining organization.
     5.4.2. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the folder to the gaining
     unit.

5.5. Retention of Records. Retain all individual records in the training folder until reviewed by the gain-
ing unit. After review, return those forms not retained in the folder to the individual.

5.6. Formal Training Graduates. For formal training school graduates reporting directly to an overseas
command for a short tour will retain the formal training school records for transfer to the subsequent gain-
ing unit.
