This instruction implements AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements, AFI 25-201, Support Agreements
Procedures, and DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental Support. It describes
procedures for processing support agreements within the 72d Air Base Wing. It applies to all
Functional Area Agreement Coordinators (FAACs) when their specific functional areas are
identified in a staffed agreement; and Receivers as it applies to their requested support and
whether they are working support agreements according to established timelines. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
the Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at ttps://www.my.af.mil/gcess-af61a/afrims/afrims

1. Procedures:
   1.1. The Plans and Integration Section (72 LRS/LGRDX) Support Agreement Manager
   (SAM) routes all incoming support agreements to applicable FAACs for review. Suspenses
   are established in Figure 3.1., Support Agreements Process Flow Chart. If an extension is
   required, FAACs will send an extension request by electronic mail (e-mail) to the SAM with
   rational for extension. The FAAC must specify the exact amount of additional time required
   to complete the review.
   1.2. The Plans and Integration Section is the central repository for all agreements made
   under the provisions of AFPD 25-2, AFI 25-201, and DoDI 4000.19.

2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. The Plans and Integration Section SAM:
       2.1.1. Maintains a current file and catalog of support for all support agreements.
       2.1.2. Reviews all new, revised and pen and ink changed agreements.
       2.1.3. Distributes Receiver requests for support to Supplier’s FAACs for review,
       coordination, and acceptance.
       2.1.4. Initiates annual informal review of all agreements managed to ensure they are up-
       to-date and providing the necessary support required by the Receiver.
    2.2. The Supplier FAACs will:
       2.2.1. Review specific provisions and terms of support request relating to his/her
       functional area. FAACs must ensure they have a clear understanding of the Receiver’s
       exact intent for the requested support and this intent is defined in the proposed support
       agreement. FAACs will ensure requests contain sufficient information to determine the
       impact the requested support will have an the FAAC’s organization. FAACs will ensure
       all echelons of Supplier organizations are aware of impact.
       2.2.2. Negotiate all required changes to specific provisions and terms with Receiver’s
       FAAC.
       2.2.3. Ensure impasses are worked through functional channels.
3. Support Agreement Steps:
3. 1. In accordance with AFI 25-201, paragraph 2.4.1.9.
 , when submissions for a new agreement are required, Supplier and Receiver FAACs will
submit final provisions with exact wording ensuring clear intent. They will avoid vague
phraseology (e.g. “as required,” ”as necessary,” “as authorized,” etc.). Specific provisions will be
written in complete sentences with all acronyms defined, and all referenced
regulations/instructions identified. Microsoft Word document format will be used and submitted
to the SAM for compilation into the final support agreement document.
    3.1.1. The final provisions will conform to the format used in Attachment 2.
       3.1.2. Submission of this document will be as an e-mail attachment to the SAM from
       Supplier FAAC (cc to Receiver) and implies concurrence by Supplier FAAC and
       Receiver. The document will be added to the new support agreement as written.
       3.1.3. Suspenses for each stage of the support agreement process are noted on Figure 3.1.
       Supplier FAAC will work with Receiver FAAC and will have up to 15 business days
       from notification to submit agreed upon final/exact wording as outlined in paragraphs 3.1
       and 3.1.1.
       3.1.4. The SAM will compile submissions into a final draft agreement and route for
       review according to Figure 3.1. Each Supplier and Receiver FAAC will have up to 10
       business days from receipt of draft to recommend changes. No response constitutes
       consent to final version of support agreement. At this stage, new additions to support
       requirements must be approved by Group Commander or equivalent.

4. Impasse: If, after local Supplier-Receiver negotiations fail, and an irreconcilable
disagreement between Receiver and Supplier exists, the Supplier FAAC will document facts
related to the problem and forward for resolution at base level. In accordance with AFI 25-201,
paragraph 5.5., this impasse documentation may be forwarded from 72 ABW to the appropriate
HQ AFMC functional manager for resolution. The AFMC functional manager may coordinate
with the appropriate MAJCOM functional manager. If resolution is not reached at this level, the
AFMC functional manager may forward all documentation concerning this impasse to HQ
USAF for final resolution.

5. 72 ABW/CC Monthly Brief: SAM should report to 72 ABW/CC on in-process support
agreements (initial and revised). On a monthly basis, SAM should specifically highlight
delinquent products required from Tinker Air Force Base host and tenant organizations to
accomplish the support agreement process.
