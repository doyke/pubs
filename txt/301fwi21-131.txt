     aircraft immediately after delivery. The aircraft records jacket and Air Force Technical
     Order (AFTO) Form 781, Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document binders will be
     delivered to 301 MOF/MXOOS, Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D).
     Maintenance will be limited to normal inspection, servicing and minor configuration changes
     until the records have been reviewed and a pre-depot return inspection meeting has occurred.

     Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS).
     2.2. PS&D will:
