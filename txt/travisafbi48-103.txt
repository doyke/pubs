SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Section 3, Section 6.2, addition of Section 10, and the removal of the previous
Attachment 4 - Travis AFB HAZCOM Program Checklist.
1. Applicability.
     1.1. IAW AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.2
2. Mandatory, Preferred and Acceptable Requirements.
     2.1. May. Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method of accomplishment.
     2.2. Should. Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
     2.3. Will/Must. Indicates a mandatory requirement and is also used to express a declaration
     of intent, probability or determination.
3. Workplace Specific Written Hazard Communication Program.
     3.1. Shops using and/or handling hazardous materials will maintain a written Hazard
     Communication Program book. The written program should consist of a three-ring binder or
     be electronic. It should be divided into six sections or tabs (Tab A-F). Ultimately, it must
     comply with AFI 90-821. The binder should be labeled with the squadron/organization,
     workplace name and the words ―Hazard Communication Program Book.‖ The written
     Hazard Communication Program book will have something comparable or specifically the
     following sections or tabs:
     3.2. Tab A - A copy of this instruction.
     3.3. Tab B - A copy of AFI 90-821. DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, may be used if AFI
     90-821 is accessible to all workers during all shifts. The cross-reference form must identify
     the specific location of the instruction (office or room name/number, shelf, binder
     name/number).
     3.4. Tab C - A hazardous chemical inventory for the work area. As a minimum, the
     hazardous chemical inventory will have all the elements (product name, manufacturer,
     National Stock Number, Local Purchase Number or part number) specified in Attachment 2.
     Each product entry will be numbered to correspond with the appropriate MSDS in Tab D.
     3.5. Tab D – How MSDSs for all hazardous materials used in the workplace are accessible
     to employees. If a ―Right to Know‖ station is set up in the shop, a DD Form 2861 may be
     substituted and will identify the specific location of the MSDS station. Requestors of
     hazardous materials must maintain copies of completed AF Forms 3952, Chemical
     Hazardous Material Request, IAW AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management. Attach
     each AF Form 3952 of a process behind its corresponding MSDSs.
     3.6. Tab E - A list of non-routine tasks involving hazardous materials (see paragraph 6 for
     additional details). The list of non-routine tasks should be prepared in a format similar to
     Attachment 3.
     3.7. Tab F - AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or an approved
     computerized training documentation system (CAMS, G081/GUI, EESOH-MIS) will be used
TRAVISAFBI48-103 7 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 3


   to track and document training for all employees trained on this program. Computer-
   automated training databases must be approved by both Public Health Flight (PHF) and
   Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (BEF) if they are used to document training. If
   training records are maintained elsewhere, a DD Form 2861 may be substituted and will
   include the specific location of the training records. Training documentation on AF Form
   55s will include the date of initial Federal Hazard Communication training and the dates of
   workplace specific Hazard Communication training. Training documentation will include
   signature of trainee and supervisor for each new entry.
4. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
   4.1. An MSDS (either paper or electronic) for each hazardous material used and/or stored in
   the workplace will be readily available and readily accessible to all workers during all shifts.
   An MSDS will be obtained prior to ordering any new hazardous material and will be
   submitted via EESOH-MIS for review by the Hazardous Material Management Process
   Team (HMMP). The HMMP Team will then determine authorization for ordering hazardous
   materials as described in paragraph 9. However, even when new materials are ordered and
   MSDSs are received, MSDSs for old materials must be retained until the supply of that
   material is depleted.
   4.2. Reference AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.5., for more information on MSDSs and their use.
      4.2.1. As OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) transitions to the
      Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS), those
      data sheets will be considered interchangeable and acceptable in lieu of an MSDS. See
      the OSHA website: http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/global.html.
5. Labels and Other Forms of Warning.
   5.1. Containers of hazardous materials brought in or used within an installation will be
   labeled, tagged, or marked with the following information:
      5.1.1. Identity of the hazardous material.
      5.1.2. Appropriate hazard warnings.
      5.1.3. Name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer, importer, or other
      responsible party.
   5.2. According to the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200, the
   hazardous material manufacturer, importer, or distributor is required to label, tag, or mark
   each container of hazardous material with the name and address of the manufacturer,
   importer, or other responsible party. These labels will not be removed, defaced, or changed.
   5.3. Reference AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.6, for more information on labels and other forms
   of warning.
      5.3.1. GHS, when adopted, also addresses labeling requirements that meet or exceed
      current requirements.
6. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   6.1. Non-routine tasks are:
 4                                                  TRAVISAFBI48-103 7 FEBRUARY 2012


        6.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area’s normal activities but performed
        infrequently, (e.g., fuel tank entry, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent,
        cleaning up hazardous material spills, etc.).
        6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
        (AFSC) or job series.
     6.2. The work area supervisor will ensure an operating instruction (OI) describing all non-
     routine tasks performed in the work area which involves hazardous materials, is written and
     coordinated with BEF. Operating instructions do not need to be prepared if technical orders
     (TO) or other official documents adequately describe these tasks. Supervisors will ensure
     workers review these procedures before performing non-routine tasks. If the work area has
     no non-routine tasks, the supervisor must document such in the workplace specific
     HAZCOM.
     6.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
     the activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the
     activity:
        6.3.1. The initial Federal Hazard Communication Training Program described in AFI 90-
        821 for workers not previously trained.
        6.3.2. Supplemental work place specific hazard communication training for all newly
        assigned workers.
        6.3.3. The supervisor of the activity will forward documentation to the worker’s formal
        supervisor describing the training conducted so that the individual’s AF Form 55 can be
        updated.
     6.4. Reference AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.9., for more information on documentation of non-
     routine tasks.
7. Employee Information and Training.
     7.1. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for ensuring all workers are properly
     trained on the work area’s specific hazards prior to the use of hazardous materials.
     7.2. Supervisors will ensure the appropriate functionals (i.e., 60 AMDS/SGPM, 60
     AMDS/SGPB, 60 AMW/SEG, 60 CES/CEF, 60 CES/CEAN, and 349 AMW/SE) review and
     approve the workplace specific HAZCOM program for technical accuracy and completeness
     prior to implementation in the work area/shop. The actual document should allow room for
     signatures from each of these agencies. Annual coordination of the approved workplace
     specific HAZCOM program is not required; however any changes in work processes,
     hazards, hazardous materials or equipment will require a revised workplace specific
     HAZCOM program and re-coordination through the appropriate functional manager.
     7.3. General Hazard Communication Training is only required once, during initial training.
     7.4. Work Place Specific Hazard Communication Training will:
        7.4.1. Include as a minimum:
            7.4.1.1. Operations in the work area where hazardous materials are present.
TRAVISAFBI48-103 7 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              5


          7.4.1.2. Physical hazards associated with each task accomplished and/or chemical
          used.
          7.4.1.3. Chemical inventory location and requirements.
          7.4.1.4. Availability (location and accessibility) and use of MSDSs.
          7.4.1.5. Chemical hazard determination procedures.
          7.4.1.6. Protective measures required for tasks and/or chemical use (personal
          protective equipment (PPE), engineering controls, administrative controls and/or
          emergency procedures).
          7.4.1.7. Container labeling (including secondary containers) requirements and
          procedures.
          7.4.1.8. Non-routine task listing and associated hazards.
          7.4.1.9. Training requirements and procedures.
      7.4.2. Be given by an individual familiar with the shop processes and associated hazards.
      7.4.3. Be conducted, as a minimum, initially and anytime thereafter when workplace
      hazards change (i.e., addition of hazardous material, changes in hazardous material use,
      changes in equipment).
   7.5. Reference AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7., for more information on employee training.
8. Documentation of the Federal Hazard Communication Training Program (FHCTP).
   8.1. Supervisors are required to document both general and workplace specific employee
   FHCTP training (initial and supplemental) on AF Form 55. Each time the work place
   hazards change additional ―Work Place Specific FHCTP‖ training is required. This training
   must be documented.
   8.2. AF Form 55 or an equivalent product (e.g., AFFORMs, CAMs, CAS-B, GO81) will be
   used to document safety, fire and health training unless other documentation is specified
   elsewhere. Documentation will be maintained by the supervisor within the work center.
   8.3. Reference AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7.4, for more information on documentation of
   employee training.
9. Hazardous Material Ordering.
   9.1. All hazardous materials (stock listed/non-stock listed used by military, civilian, or
   contract employees) used on Travis AFB must be coordinated with HazMart or other
   pertinent SOS. If an MSDS and an AF Form 3952 have not been previously submitted and
   approved by the HMMP Team, the supervisor will acquire a MSDS at no cost to the
   government, complete AF Form 3952 include applicable TO, or other official documentation,
   and (if applicable) complete a local purchase request form. The order request and required
   documentation are then submitted to the HazMart or other pertinent SOS for evaluation and
   approval by the HMMP Team prior to ordering.

10. Contractor Operations.
     10.1. The Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) and Quality Assurance Personnel
     (QAP), with assistance from BEF, HazMart, building custodian, and work area supervisor, if
     requested, will advise contractors prior to start of work of:
        10.1.1. Hazardous materials and hazardous waste they may encounter. All MSDSs of
        DoD materials will be available to contractor(s) through the ACO. The ACO will advise
        the contractor(s) on the base policy regarding the Hazard Communication Program.
        10.1.2. Applicable health and safety regulations for contractor personnel.
     10.2. The ACO and QAP will review contractor’s list of hazardous materials proposed for
     use on Travis AFB. Ensure 29 CFR 1910.1200 and AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material
     Management, is available and complied with by contract employees.
     10.3. At the pre-performance conference and subsequently during the contract performance
     period, the requiring activity QAP will advise work area supervisors and USAF employees
     monitoring the performance of contractor(s) of hazardous materials introduced by the
     contractor. The contractor is required to submit information on the use of hazardous
     materials according to Clause 52.223-3, Hazardous Material Identification and Material
     Safety Data, of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 23.3.3.
     10.4. If a contractor is required to bring hazardous material onto the base in performance of
     the contract, the hazardous material must first be authorized and tracked through the
     HazMart. Use procedures that have been approved by the HMMP Team to authorize and
     track contractor hazardous material usage.
11. Hazard Determination.
     11.1. For very few shops on this base, if any, the shop may produce chemicals and must
     formulate hazard determinations and produce an MSDS. If applicable, refer to AFI 90-821,
     paragraph 2.4 or contact BEF.
