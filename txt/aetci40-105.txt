AETCI40-105 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      3


      2.7.2. Collect and provide attrition-related information for each recruit who does not
      graduate from BMT.
      2.7.3. Provide facilities and scheduling support for the BMT component of the BEST
      Program.
3. BEST Program. The BEST Program consists of two components (1) an operational clinical
screening and interview component which will be the responsibility of 559 MDOS/SGPL and
559 MDOS/SGPK and (2) a large-scale studies and analysis component which will be the
responsibility of 559 MDOS/SGPL.
   3.1. Component I, Operational Screening and Interviews. This component occurs
   during BMT.
      3.1.1. Phase I screening is mandatory for all trainees and occurs during the first 72 hours
      of in-processing.      The screening questionnaire will be administered by 559
      MDOS/SGPL, Psychology Research Service (PRS) to all recruits. Responses to mental
      and behavioral health questions will be used to identify individuals with behavioral or
      mental health issues. Trainees are told that the information obtained can be used for
      routine purposes related to job classification, administrative discharge, and referrals for
      further evaluation. Trainees who report the most significant problems on the
      questionnaire are sent for Phase II screening.
      3.1.2. Phase II screening is mandatory for those trainees referred to in the last sentence
      of paragraph 3.1.1 and occurs no later than the end of week 1 of BMT. Interviews will
      be conducted by mental health technicians to clarify responses on the screening
      questionnaire. A PRS or Behavioral Analysis Service (BAS) psychologist will review
      the questionnaire and mental health technician interview results. The PRS/BAS
      psychologist can recommend disqualification from sensitive occupations.                  A
      recommendation of “disqualify from sensitive skills” will be sent to 2AF, Det 1. In
      addition, the psychologist will make referrals for medical, substance abuse, and mental
      health evaluations. All referrals generated as a result of the Phase II process are
      voluntary and require informed consent by trainees, with the exception of those who are
      psychotic or at imminent risk for harming self or others IAW AFI 44-109 and DoDI
      6490.04, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Military Services. Trainees who
      report acute medical problems will be referred to Trainee Health at Reid Clinic. Those
      who endorse problematic substance use will be referred to Personnel Psychological
      Assessment (PPA). Trainees who are in need of a mental health evaluation, but who do
      not need to be evaluated for a psychiatric hospitalization, will receive a referral to BAS
      for a Phase III evaluation. Trainees who are at imminent risk for a psychotic episode or
      for harming self or others will be sent to the San Antonio Military Medical Center IAW
      AFI 44-109 and DoDI 6490.04. Lastly, all encounters will be documented in the
      trainee’s outpatient medical record.
      3.1.3. Phase III evaluations are conducted by BAS psychology providers. Either
      informed consent must be obtained or follow procedures as directed in AFI 44-109 . The
      evaluations will be conducted on the same day as the referral when a trainee is at risk for
      harming self or others. For other recruits, Phase III evaluations will occur within two
      duty days. Based on their initial evaluation, the BAS psychology providers can return
      trainees to duty or have them return to the clinic for additional evaluation or treatment. If
 4                                                            AETCI40-105 15 OCTOBER 2013


        necessary they can also refer trainees for an evaluation for psychiatric hospitalization.
        BAS psychologists may send clinical recommendations to the trainee’s squadron
        commander. They can recommend an administrative separation under AFI 36-3208,
        Administrative Separation of Airmen, or AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement
        Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.
        3.1.4. All mental health referrals will be made in accordance with the requirements of
        AFI 44-109.
     3.2. Component II, Large-Scale Studies and Analyses.
        3.2.1. Conduct studies and analyses for two broad reasons:
            3.2.1.1. To provide information on the resilience, mental health, and behavioral
            problems of past and current Airmen.
            3.2.1.2. To evaluate the effectiveness of assessment, screening and selection
            processes for enlistment, assignment, deployment and retention.
        3.2.2. Individual medical, personnel and behavioral records will be obtained to provide
        information and permit analysis. These records will use the Airman’s Social Security
        Number for identification and will include Airman formerly and currently serving in
        military positions.
        3.2.3. Per DoD guidance, written agreements will be required for all data sets received
        that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). These agreements may be
        Memorandum of Agreements (MOA), Data Use Agreements (DUA), or Memorandum of
        Understandings (MOU) but at a minimum will cover the protection of the data, the reason
        for collecting the data, and use and disposition of the data.
        3.2.4. The BEST Program will follow guidance in AFI 33-332 with regard to PII. The
        number of individuals having access to PII will be restricted and PII elements will be
        removed from analysis files whenever possible.
        3.2.5. The Chief of PRS will advise all programmers and analysts of the sensitive nature
        of the information. Analysts and programmers sited at the Defense Manpower Data
        Center (DMDC) and JBSA Lackland TX will complete annual Privacy Act Training and
        Information Awareness Training prior to gaining access to data sets. Similarly, for
        research studies, all Investigators and Associate Investigators will complete Institution
        Review Board (IRB) approved training prior to gaining access to data sets.
        3.2.6. Studies which add time to the BMT Program require 737 TRG/CC approval.
        3.2.7. The BEST Program studies, analyses and findings will be presented to the 59th
        Medical Wing and AFMOA, and, when appropriate, shared with the AFMS and AF via
        published reports, briefings, articles, book chapters, and/or analytic notes. All results will
        be subject to Air Force management, Public Affairs requirements and peer review.
4. Policies.
     4.1. Only trained mental health personnel and qualified PRS/BAS psychologists will conduct
     the operational clinical interviews.
AETCI40-105 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                              5


  4.2. No recommendation for separating individuals will be made solely on the basis of the
  questionnaire and a mental health technician interview.
  4.3. Squadron instructors and commanders cannot view the questionnaire raw data.
