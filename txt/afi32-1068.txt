     contain all pertinent information. The heat plant foreman or operations flight maintenance
     chief must maintain boiler plant performance and operating logs for the following boilers:
     (T-1)
        3.5.2.1. High pressure (over 103 kPa [15 psig] steam and 121 °C [250 °F]).
        3.5.2.2. 1103 kPa (160 psig) high-temperature water (HTW) boiler plant with output
        capacity of 0.41 MW (1.4 MBtu/h) or more.
        3.5.2.3. Low-pressure boiler plant with output of 1.41 MW (4.8 MBtu/h). The BCE
        sends operating logs for high-pressure plants 4.1 MW (14 MBtu/h) or larger to the
        MAJCOM (if required by the MAJCOM).
     3.5.3. Maintenance. At dual-fuel plants, fire boilers at least bimonthly with standby
     fuel to confirm reliability. Overhaul equipment and accomplish other major maintenance
     during off-peak periods. Annually calibrate boiler instrumentation. Ensure that
     replacement materials and parts comply with boiler code safety standards. Maintain
     equipment ASME code stamps and labels in legible condition. The BCE will ensure that
     scheduled maintenance of boilers, heating equipment, and steam traps is accomplished.
     (T-1)
        3.5.3.1. Pressure Vessel Welding. The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,
        Section IX, “Welding and Brazing Qualifications,” contains welding procedural
        specifications and welder qualification requirements. Do not weld or braze pressure
        components of steam-jacketed cooking equipment; replace failed parts. (T-0)
        3.5.3.2. Distribution Systems. Accomplish maintenance according                to   the
        manufacturer’s recommendations and appropriate repair codes. (T-3)
            3.5.3.2.1. Existing Systems. At least annually, pressure test the outer conduit of
            direct burial systems (with pressure-test capability). Pressure test the outer
            conduit at 103 kPa (15 psig) for 24 hours. Record results in a permanent log;
            include a summary of events and final analysis. With systems that cannot be
            pressure tested, use thermograph technology or other approved testing methods as
            recommended by the manufacturer. (T-2) Recommend system be inspected
            annually for damage or loss of insulation. Repair as necessary to maintain
            insulating qualities. (T-3)
            3.5.3.2.2. Failed Distribution Lines. Make temporary repairs to failed lines as
            soon as conditions permit. Program replacement of failed sections as soon as the
            extent of failure is known. Notify the MAJCOM when you are considering
            replacement. (T-1)
            3.5.3.2.3. Temporary Repairs. Temporary repairs are permitted to direct buried
            systems using piping other than prefabricated conduit systems. Limit these repairs
            to 152.4 meters (500 feet) per repair, and replace these repairs within 18 months
            with an approved system and materials. Repair material must be suitable for use
            under the pressure and temperature conditions of the distribution system being
            repaired. (T-1)
            3.5.3.2.4. Cathodic Protection Systems. Where cathodic protection is installed
            on distribution lines, inspection, testing, and maintenance must be accomplished
10                                                      AFI32-1068 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


            in accordance with AFI 321054 and Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-570-06,
            Operation and Maintenance: Cathodic Protection Systems. (T-2)
     3.5.4. Replacing or Installing New Distribution Lines. Before replacing failed lines or
     installing new lines, select a route, then a system type.
        3.5.4.1. Route Selection. The system route should be coordinated with the facility
        master plan. The selected route has considerable impact on system type selection. For
        example, aboveground systems usually are not acceptable if they create obstructions
        to traffic or are unsightly, while large numbers of obstructions along the system
        profile greatly increase the cost of underground systems. Attention should be given to
        any severe or complex installation conditions that adversely affect the cost of the
        system. The final route selected should minimize the system life-cycle cost.
        3.5.4.2. System Type Selection. Evaluate potential heat distribution system types
        according to the following order of preference: (1) aboveground; (2) shallow concrete
        trench; (3) direct buried prefabricated conduit; (4) poured-in-place underground
        insulation system. (T-1) Select the most cost-effective system based on the results of
        a life-cycle cost analysis. (T-1) Calculate heat loss for each system under
        consideration by using standard American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air
        Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) methods. (T-2) Evaluate life-cycle costs of the
        alternatives by using the Building Life-Cycle Cost program (BLCC) available at the
        Federal           Energy            Management             Program           website:
        http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/information/download_blcc.html.               Note:
        Studies by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory
        (USACERL) indicate that, in general, life-cycle cost is lower for shallow concrete
        trenches than direct burial systems. (T-2)
        3.5.4.3. Installation. Install and test new systems per the Unified Facilities Guide
        Specifications (UFGS)(reference paragraph 3.5.4.4), manufacturer’s requirements, or
        by other approved methods. Recommend an authorized factory representative be
        present during installation and testing of systems. Complete all tests and correct
        deficiencies prior to insulating or covering connections, joints, welds, or fittings.
        Promptly send a copy of the test results to the MAJCOM for evaluation. (T-1)
        3.5.4.4. Unified Facilities Guide Specification (UFGS) for the Design and
        Construction of New or Replacement Distribution Systems. Design and construct
        new and replacement distribution systems to UFGS requirements. UFGS are available
        at the Whole Building Design Guide (www.wbdg.org). (T-1) Refer to Attachment 1
        for the appropriate UFGS for design and installation of new or replacement
        distribution lines.

20                                                        AFI32-1068 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


  A2.2.3. Frequency of HTW Boiler Internal Inspections After Two Years. After
  operating and inspecting the boiler for two years, extend the frequency of internal inspection
  to three years if: (T-0)
     A2.2.3.1. No adverse conditions such as scale or corrosion are present.
     A2.2.3.2. The amount of makeup water is negligible.
     A2.2.3.3. Effective chemical treatment is under strict control.
  A2.2.4. Questionable Steam and HTW Boilers. Perform a Type BB inspection when: (1)
  a boiler has been reinstalled; or (2) a boiler had major repairs (as defined in the NBIC).
  Inspect before returning the boiler to normal operation. Perform a Type BA inspection six
  months after resuming operation. Ensure an NBIC inspector performs a preliminary Type BA
  or Type BB inspection before initiating a major repair. (T-0)
  A2.2.5. Low-Pressure Heating Boilers. Perform a Type BC inspection on: (1) hot water
  heating boilers that operate at or below 121 °C (250 °F) and at or below 1103 kPa (160 psig)
  annually; or (2) low-pressure steam boilers (below 103 kPa [15 psig]) biannually. Only
  boilers less than 0.293 MW (1 MBtu/h) output that produce domestic hot water are exempt
  from this inspection requirement. (T-1) Inspections do not require a certified inspector but at
  a minimum must be accomplished by experienced, qualified base personnel as approved by
  the BCE. (T-3)
  A2.2.6. Compressed Air Receivers and Other Unfired Pressure Vessels (UPV). Perform
  a Type VE inspection every three years, except for liquefied petroleum (propane) tanks,
  which require a Type VC inspection every five years. (T-0) When questionable conditions or
  inspection indicates that a safety problem exists (T-0)
     A2.2.6.1. Conduct hydrostatic tests.
     A2.2.6.2. Notify the MAJCOM by telephone, followed by letter, e-mail, or FAX, of a
     pressure vessel safety problem and provide a copy of the UPV inspection.
     A2.2.6.3. Perform repairs as required.
     A2.2.6.4. Perform a Type VE inspection annually until all problems are corrected.
     A2.2.6.5. After the inspection indicates that problems are corrected, perform an
     inspection every three years or five years, as required. (T-0) Note: For pressure vessels
     that operate over 1379 kPa (200 psig) and cannot be inspected internally and externally,
     perform hydrostatic testing to 1.5 times working pressure every three years. (T-0)
  A2.2.7. New Boilers. Perform a Type BB inspection on all new boilers (steam or HTW)
  before operation. (T-0)
  A2.2.8. Scheduling and Obtaining Inspection Services.
     A2.2.8.1. Continental United States (CONUS) Bases. The MAJCOM ensures an
     inspection contract is in place and boilers and pressure vessels are scheduled for the
     required inspections. The central Air Force contract may be used. The MAJCOM
     coordinates with AFCEC and notifies other MAJCOMs before initiating a separate
     contract proposal. (T-0)
AFI32-1068 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    21


     A2.2.8.1.1. Scheduled Inspections (CONUS Bases). The BCE schedules inspections
     according to one of two methods: (1) submits annual inspection requirements according
     to MAJCOM instructions; or (2) confirms computer-generated schedules according to
     MAJCOM instructions. (T-1)
         A2.2.8.1.2. Unscheduled Inspections (CONUS Bases). If a boiler or pressure
         vessel requires an inspection and is not on the annual schedule, the BCE or a
         designated representative must request approval for inspection. (T-2) Submit the
         request according to MAJCOM instructions when using the central Air Force
         contract. Provide the MAJCOM and the AFCEC contracting officer’s representative
         (COR) with a request for unscheduled boiler inspections, including the following
         information: a point of contact and alternate; commercial phone numbers, including
         area code; approximate date of inspection; and location of the vessel to be inspected
         (e.g., building number) by telephone, e-mail, or FAX, before scheduling the
         inspections. The contractor must receive approval from the AFCEC COR prior to
         performing inspections. (T-1)
         A2.2.8.1.3. Special Inspections (CONUS Bases).
             A2.2.8.1.3.1. Perform a special inspection (Type BA or BB) before starting
             repairs to pressure components. Perform an unscheduled Type BB inspection
             when repairs to pressure components are complete. Arrange these special
             inspections through the MAJCOM. Perform a special inspection after a boiler
             failure with potential damage or explosion to determine the extent of damage or
             necessary repairs. Depending upon the boiler condition, a loss analysis or useful
             life study may need to be conducted. The host MAJCOM or base must fund
             special studies. (T-1)
             A2.2.8.1.3.2. If the company under contract cannot make a special or emergency
             inspection, the BCE may hire an authorized inspection agency. An installation
             employee must not make these special inspections. (T-1)
     A2.2.8.2. Bases Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). MAJCOMs
     serving bases in foreign countries must ensure a boiler inspection program exists. (T-0)
     Some host countries have their own boiler inspection program and may require the BCE
     to use their services. In other cases, the MAJCOM may use the CONUS inspection
     guidelines to establish a separate program. Bases in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, other non-
     CONUS states, possessions, or territories, and foreign countries may also use the services
     available to CONUS bases.
     A2.2.8.3. Special Inspections (U. S. Bases in Foreign Countries). MAJCOMs serving
     these bases must have qualified and competent boiler inspectors perform special
     inspections. (T-0) (Base-level personnel must not supervise these inspectors.) (T-1) The
     inspection agency must ensure a complete report for each inspection is sent to the
     MAJCOM. (T-1)
  A2.2.9. Inspector Qualifications. The NBIC establishes basic qualifications for boiler
  inspectors in the United States, its territories, and possessions. Inspectors must hold a current
  National Board Commission. (T-0) MAJCOMs must use the NBIC standards for bases in
  foreign countries if the host country does not have NBIC-equivalent standards. (T-0)
22                                                        AFI32-1068 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


  A2.2.10. Hydrostatic Testing of Boilers.
     A2.2.10.1. Establishing Test Conditions. During hydrostatic tests to determine
     tightness under Type BB or BD inspections: (T-0)
         A2.2.10.1.1. Remove safety valves before testing or hold down each disc with a test
         clamp or plug device designed for this purpose.
         A2.2.10.1.2. Ensure water temperature is not less than ambient and between 21 °C
         and 49 °C (70 °F and 120 °F).
         A2.2.10.1.3. Ensure test pressure is equal to boiler working pressure, but not greater
         than the set pressure of the safety device with the lowest setting. Note: For tests under
         a Type BB inspection, externally inspect the boiler during the safety test at the
         pressure described above. Set test pressure for inspections of new boilers and existing
         boilers before and after repairs at 1.5 times the maximum allowable working pressure.
     A2.2.10.2. When to Hydrostatically Test High-Pressure Boilers. Subject high-
     pressure boilers to hydrostatic tests only under specific conditions: (T-0)
         A2.2.10.2.1. Upon completion of installation. (Include this requirement in the
         construction contract as a contractor’s responsibility.)
         A2.2.10.2.2. After completing major repairs to any boiler component subject to
         steam or water pressure.
         A2.2.10.2.3. Before returning boilers to service in reactivated plants.
         A2.2.10.2.4. When the boiler inspector, the facility, or MAJCOM engineer
         recommends the test.
         A2.2.10.2.5. At the frequency required in paragraphs A2.2 through A2.2.1.3.
