            POLICY: THE IG COMPLAINTS PROGRAM INVESTIGATES
        POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF STANDARDS AND PROVIDES REDRESS
       OR APPEALS WHERE NONE ALREADY EXIST. ADDITIONALLY, THE IG
         INVESTIGATES POTENTIAL FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE ISSUES.
 You have the right to file an IG complaint without restriction or fear of reprisal; but
 first, verify the facts and give your chain of command a chance to handle the problem.
 Experience has shown that complaints can be best resolved at lower levels before IG
 intervention.
 To file an IG complaint briefly outline the facts and relevant background information
 related to the issue or complaint on an AF Form 102 in chronological order while
 answering the following questions.
 • Who committed the violation?
 • What violation was committed?
 • What law, regulation, procedure, or policy was violated?
 • When did the violation occur?
 • What resolution strategy are you seeking? What is your 'bottom line'?
 • You may submit an issue or complaint in-person, anonymously, or via E-mail below.

YOU WILL RECEIVE AN OBJECTIVE, FAIR, AND PROMPT RESPONSE USING THE
            IG COMPLAINTS RESOLUTION PROGRAM (CRP).
