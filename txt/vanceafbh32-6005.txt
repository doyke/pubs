                               INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Vance Air Force Base Unaccompanied Housing (UH), also referred to as dorms
or dormitories. This handbook is designed to provide you, the dormitory resident, with the
information you need to maintain your quarters. The Air Force responsibilities and your
responsibilities are explained. We hope you will enjoy your stay at Vance Air Force Base. If you
have questions, please contact the appropriate UH management office. The UH management for
unaccompanied officer quarter (UOQ) residents is the Lodging Office located in building 714
and can be reached at 213-7358. The UH management office for unaccompanied enlisted quarter
(UEQ) residents is located in building 423, and can be reached at 213-7212 during normal duty
hours (0800-1645 Monday through Friday). Enlisted residents should contact the Lodging Office
after normal duty hours (1645-0800).
SECTION A - AIR FORCE RESPONSIBILITIES
The following will be performed by the base in support of your assigned unaccompanied
housing: All maintenance and repair, refuse collection, and fire and police protection.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR. Civil Engineer (CE) has the primary responsibility for
maintenance and repair of the UH. To request maintenance, contact the UH management office
(213-7212 for enlisted and 213-7358 for officers and enlisted after duty hours). The UH
management office will contact CE and track the work order. Maintenance requests can be made
24 hours a day. UH management office is required to track all work orders assigned to the UHs.
Please do not by-pass the UH management office by calling CE directly. CE only accepts calls
from the facility manager.

After CE receives the request for maintenance, the service call specialist will provide the UH
management office with a work order number and the approximate date/time the work will be
performed. The UH management office will provide you with this information upon request.

There are three categories of service: emergency, urgent, and routine. The category determines
when the maintenance will be accomplished.

     Emergency - elimination of the condition within 24 hours of notification.
     Urgent - within 7 calendar days after identifying the requirement or receipt of material.
     Routine -within 30 calendar days after identifying the requirement or receipt of material.

Emergency service calls are work requirements which should receive immediate attention.
Examples are:

     1) A structural, utility, or mechanical problem that could cause a loss of life or property.
     2) Serious damage affecting health, safety, security, or mission.
     3) Complete utility failure (electricity, gas, heating, water, sewage, or air-conditioning).

Urgent service calls are work requirements which do not immediately endanger the residents or
threaten damage to property, but would soon inconvenience and affect the health and well-being
of the residents.

Routine service calls are work requirements that are routine in nature and do not meet the
criteria of emergency or urgent.

REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. Dumpsters are provided for the disposal of refuse
(trash). CE empties dumpsters at all UHs semi-weekly. In order to maintain safe and sanitary
conditions, you are asked to do the following:

     1) Place all trash in trash bags
     2) Place trash bags inside the dumpster (not on the ground by the dumpster or outside the
     dumpster fence)
     3) Break down cardboard boxes before placing into the dumpster; we encourage you to
     recycle cardboard (see the next paragraph on recycling)
     4) Do not place hot coals in the dumpster
     5) Do not place unauthorized items in the dumpster (oils, solvents, paint, old tires, etc.)
     Please refer to the paragraph on Environment in Section B
     6) Do not block the dumpsters with your vehicle
     7) Do not place trash/refuse in recycling containers

RECYCLING. You are encouraged to use the recycling containers located nearest your facility or
the trailer located north of the Commissary on the gravel parking area just south of the CE
compound. Bins are clearly marked for the type of materials and may be used at any time.
Please remove lids, caps, and neck rings, rinse all liquid containers, and flatten all cardboard
boxes. Labels may be left on containers. Recyclable items include:

     Glass: clear, green, or the brown bottles or jars
     Aluminum: beverage cans
     Paper: newspapers/inserts, office paper, magazines and paper bags
     Cardboard: corrugated boxes, packaging, and paperboard - call 213-7559 to arrange for a
     special pickup of large quantities of cardboard
     Steel/Tin: food cans
     Plastic: beverage containers, liquid detergent and motor oil containers

Examples of items that should not be placed in the recycling containers are:

     Windowpanes, mirrors, ceramics, crystal or light bulbs
     Aluminum foil or pie plates
     Junk mail or envelopes
     Packaging with waxy coating
     Paint cans
     Plastic wrap or plastic packaging
     Trash/refuse

LOCKOUTS. If you are locked out of your quarters, do not panic. Contact Lodging Office
(building 714, 213-7358) personnel to obtain a temporary key. Notify UH management
personnel of lost or broken keys.

GROUNDS CARE. CE is responsible for mowing, edging, and trimming of the grounds.
Personal items should not be left in grassy areas when not in use, as they may interfere with the
grounds care. You should not leave trash or litter on the grounds, sidewalks, or parking area.

APPLIANCES. Ranges, microwaves, and refrigerators are government furnished and serviced.
These appliances are assigned by serial number. If you have problems, do not attempt to make
repairs or adjustments. Contact the UH management office for assistance.

FURNITURE. The Furnishings Management Office (FMO), located in Bldg. 244, is responsible
for maintaining all government-owned furnishings. Each room is furnished with the standard
inventory. If you wish to have an item removed, replaced, or repaired, complete AF 2519,
Furniture Removal Request, at the appropriate UH management office. The
removal/replacement of furniture will be annotated on AF 228, Furnishings Custody Receipt and
Condition Report, for your room.

LINENS. Bed linens (fitted sheet, flat sheet, mattress pad, pillows, pillowcases, pillow
protectors, blanket, and comforter) are provided by the government at no charge. If you choose
to use your own linens, they must be in good condition and large enough to cover the pillows and
the mattress. Residents are responsible for washing either their own linens or the government-
supplied linens. When a resident vacates a dorm room they will turn in the government linens to
Linen Exchange located in building 244; between 0800 to 1645 hours Monday through Friday.

LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT. Washers and dryers are available for you in each UH at no cost.
Please ask the UH office for the location of the laundry room nearest to you. Instructions for
using the washers and dryers are posted and can be found on the machines. Dryer lint traps
should be checked and emptied before and after each use. Please do not leave items unattended.
Items left overnight will be removed by UH management. The Air Force is not responsible for
stolen property. CE maintains the laundry equipment. Any maintenance problems should be
reported to UH management office, who will call CE. The laundry rooms are for occupant use
only.

MAID SERVICE. Maid service is available for a fee, paid by the month basis (performed once
per week), for all UH residents. If you wish to purchase maid service, you must complete a
statement of intent at the Lodging Office. The maid service includes the following:

     Exchange personal linens and make bed (you must provide clean linens)
     Sweep, dust and wet mop floors
     Remove trash
     Vacuum rugs
     Dust furniture, blinds, windowsills and baseboards
     Clean oven, stovetop and outside of refrigerator
     Clean bathroom

Once every month, the housekeeper will wax the floors and spot clean walls, doors and
doorframes.

Note: Housekeepers performing maid service are not responsible for the neatness of your
personal effects, clothing, foodstuffs, etc., nor will they move items to facilitate cleaning.
Housekeepers are not responsible for collecting trash throughout your room or from the interior
of your refrigerator.

NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE (NTS). The Air Force will arrange and pay for storage of
household goods that cannot be accommodated in your assigned UH room. You have 30 days
from the date you are assigned to your room or from the date your household goods are delivered
to you to bring an itemized list of items you wish to place in storage to the Housing Management
office, 4405 Lehr Street, to initiate the storage. If you do not take the storage orders (AF Form
150) to TMO for processing within 7 days of issue, the orders will be canceled. Please do not
include items you may need while at Vance AFB. Items are stored at various vendor locations,
and you will not have access to the items while they are in storage. The government only pays
for the storage while you reside in the UH. If you PCS, separate or move off base you need to
tell TMO or the Housing Management office to make arrangements to have the items removed
from storage. The cost for storage will convert to you, if the items are left in storage after you
move out of the UH.

SECTION B - OCCUPANT RESPONSIBILITIES
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE TO QUARTERS, EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS. Under
Federal Law (10 U.S.C. 2775), as amended by the FY85 MILCON Authorization Act, members
of the armed forces occupying UH shall be held liable and accountable for loss or damage to UH,
equipment or furnishings caused by the abuse or negligence of the member or the member’s
guest. While the amount of liability is limited to one month’s basic pay in cases of simple
negligence, members are liable for the full amount of damages or loss in cases of willful
misconduct or abuses. AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, provides
guidance to determine responsibility or pecuniary liability. AFMAN 23-220 explains when
claims may be waived or limited, as in the case where damage is caused by the member’s guest,
and the member had no opportunity to prevent the damage. AFMAN 23-220 establishes
procedures for processing Reports of Survey, provides direction to request reconsideration, and
describes appellate procedures for unwaived claims. Directions for submitting a request for
remission of debts in the case of officer members can also be found in AFMAN 23-220.

Members should ensure they report any maintenance issues, lack of cleaning, missing items, etc.
immediately after move-in. UH management will inspect the reported items and annotate your
file. This ensures you are not liable for these items when you move out. Items not reported
within 15 days of move-in will not be considered pre-existing.

INSURANCE. While occupying UH, it is highly recommended that you purchase commercial
renter's insurance to protect yourself in case of a major loss. Renter's insurance should specify
clearly that personal liability coverage, loss, or damage involving government quarters,
equipment and furnishings is included. A renter's insurance policy covers your personal property
as well as personal liability for government property. You may be able to obtain liability
coverage for government property without insuring your personal property if you do not desire
the latter. Specific questions can be addressed to the Staff Judge Advocate (legal office) at 213-
7404.

DAMAGE TO QUARTERS. All personnel are subject to liability for repair of property in their
care. A Report of Survey will be performed if there is a question of liability. Damages for other-
than fair wear and tear are normally considered your responsibility. All repairs/replacements you
make must be preapproved and must meet Air Force standards. If you have any questions
concerning damage to the unit, contact the appropriate UH management office for an explanation
of your options.
ENERGY CONSERVATION. Vance AFB needs your assistance in conserving energy. Rising
utility costs should encourage each of us to practice energy conservation on a daily basis. Here
are few tips on conserving utilities.

Water: We do not intend to restrict your normal and reasonable use of water. However, since
excessive water usage increases the cost and depletion of natural resources, please take action to
eliminate all waste.

Heating: Your thermostat should be set at 68° during the day. Lower settings are recommended
at night or when you go out for the major part of the day. Prevent waste by ensuring air registers
are not blocked or covered and keep exterior windows closed when the furnace is on.

Electricity: A concerted effort must be expended to conserve electricity by eliminating
unnecessary use of electricity. Funds expended for needless utilities are funds that could be used
for future improvements in UH. You can help by minimizing the use of electrical appliances and
lights, especially during the peak demands in the afternoon and early evening. Vance uses load
shedding to help reduce electrical utility consumption. Load shedding turns off air conditioners a
few minutes each half-hour when outside temperatures exceed 93° and electrical demands rise.
Air circulation fans will continue to work to help offset the increased room temperature. Load
shedding can be expected Monday through Friday, 1200-1700. You can help decrease electrical
demand by turning lights off during the day and reducing electrical usage during load shedding
periods.

ENVIRONMENT. The base Environmental office will gladly answer any questions you might
have concerning disposal or use of any chemical product. Engine oil, engine coolants, car grease
and other similar products cannot be poured into base plumbing and drainage systems (sanitary
or storm sewers), placed in trash containers (dumpsters, etc.), or allowed to spill on roads,
grounds or parking areas. Petroleum products must be disposed of in accordance with
environmental regulations. The Environmental Office is available Monday through Friday, from
0800 to 1630, to answer your questions at 213-6279.

CARE OF INTERIOR. You are expected to keep your quarters clean, tidy and uncluttered.

Kitchen/Appliances. Special attention is needed to maintain the appliances, cabinets and walls in
kitchen areas. Clean ovens, broiler units and top burners regularly to prevent grease buildup,
which can become a fire hazard (UOQs). Interiors of refrigerators should be cleaned regularly
with water and baking soda solution, rinsed and dried. The exterior of the refrigerator and the
door gasket should be cleaned frequently to remove food and grease. Do not place grease or
fibrous material such as onions and celery in the garbage disposal due to possible stoppage
problems. Do not place hot utensils on counter tops. Use only non-adhesive shelf paper in
drawers and cupboards. Walls should be cleaned periodically to prevent surface grease buildup.

Bathroom. Fixtures, walls and floors should be kept clean. Due to the tendency to mildew, you
should clean tub/shower areas periodically with a mildew-combating product. Do not use harsh
abrasives on the fiberglass bathtubs (UOQs) or shower stalls (UEQs).
Floors. Excessive water can cause damage to any floor. Please us only quality wax removers
which will prevent wax buildup. Give special attention to corners and baseboards where dirt
builds up. You should vacuum carpeted areas on a regular basis. Government-owned vacuum
cleaners are available for your use and can be checked out at your UH management office. You
should take precautions to protect carpet from stains.

Walls. We recommend using mild soap and warm water to wash walls. You should not attach
adhesive-backed materials or decals to the walls, as these can cause damage when removed. To
hang items on the wall, use nails or building type hangers. Make sure there are doorstops for all
doors to prevent damage to the walls. Contact the appropriate UH management office if you
have doorstops missing.

INSECT AND PEST CONTROL. If you experience a problem with insects or pests, notify the
appropriate UH management office, and they will notify the Entomology Shop. Please do not try
to take care of the problem yourself. Problems are seldom confined to just one room.
Entomology personnel will check the entire building and treat all infested areas.

LAUNDRY ROOMS. Clean up any spills of soap, bleach, fabric softener etc. immediately.
Clean the lint trap on the dryers before and after each use and ensure the lint, along with any
other trash, is placed in the trash containers. Please do not sit on the washers or dryers. The
government is not responsible for any personal items left in common areas, so be sure to take
everything with you.

CARE OF EXTERIOR. First impressions are lasting impressions. Even though CE is
responsible for the upkeep of the grounds, you should take pride in your home and take care not
to litter or otherwise distract from the overall appearance of the area.

Breezeways (UOQs). Breezeways should be kept clean and uncluttered. Breezeways are
considered fire lanes and must be kept unobstructed at all times. Breezeways are not authorized
storage areas. Bicycles, barbecue grills, lawn chairs etc. will not be stored in these areas. A floor
mat outside your exterior door is the only authorized item you can leave in the breezeway.
Breezeways and stairwells should be swept weekly.

Seeded/Non-Paved Areas. You may use the common areas surrounding the UHs. However,
personal items such as lawn chairs, barbecue grills, camper tops etc. should be properly stored
after each use and should not be left unattended.

Parking Lot. You may park your car, truck or motorcycle in the building parking lot.
Recreational vehicles, boats, trailers, campers, camper tops for pickup trucks etc, may be parked
in the parking lot for 2 days prior to and 2 days after an outing. These vehicles may be stored in
the government recreational vehicle storage area. A space may be obtained by contacting the
Services Logistics Support Center, at 213-7348.

Repair and Maintenance of Privately Owned Vehicles. The only authorized place to accomplish
major repairs to vehicles, including oil changes, is the base Auto Skills Center, Bldg 301.
STORAGE. You may store your charcoal fluid (not to exceed one quart) and charcoal in your
room, but must keep them separated (UOQs only).

Storage Rooms and Cages. Storage space is provided for each occupant in the storage rooms.
These areas should be kept clean and uncluttered. Fireworks may not be stored in the UHs or
used on base. UOQ residents may store propane gas (not to exceed five gallons) in individual
storage room cages. Items not secured in the storage cages or lockers are open to theft.
Authorized personnel will remove items if they pose a safety or fire hazard. NOTE: UEQ
residents are not permitted to store propane due to storage rooms being within the interior
confines of the dormitories.

Vehicle tires may not be stored in individual UH rooms.

Hazardous Material Storage Lockers. Only flammable and combustible liquids may be stored in
these lockers. Flammable liquids must be stored on the top shelf and combustible liquids on the
lower shelf. Nothing should be stored in the bottom of the locker as it is for collecting spills that
may occur. Do not store propane, charcoal, charcoal lighter fluid or any flammable/combustible
gases or solid substances in the lockers. All items stored in the lockers must be marked to
determine ownership.

VISITORS. No one is allowed to enter a UH facility/room unless they have received a specific
invitation or consent from an occupant of that facility or room. No one will remain in the
facility/rooms if a valid invitation or consent is withdrawn by the hosting occupant. This
excludes personnel in the performance of official duties (UH management, Fire Dept, CE
Maintenance, room inspectors, housekeepers etc.). No visitor under 18 years of age is
permitted unless the visitor is a member of the sponsor’s immediate family and is accompanied
by the sponsor at all times. All visitors will be clothed in an acceptable manner during visitation.
Visitors will not be given a key to your room. Receiving visitors or guests in UH is a privilege
which may be revoked from either an individual occupant or all occupants. The revocation may
be accompanied by appropriate disciplinary action.

You are responsible for your visitors at all times. Commanders may revoke visitation privileges
for misconduct or when they deem necessary to protect the health, safety, morale or welfare of
dormitory occupants. All visitors must be supervised at all times.

Baby-sitting. No baby-sitting is authorized in UH facilities.

Neither overnight visitors nor co-habitation is allowed in the UH per AFI 32-6005.




SECTION C - GOOD NEIGHBORS
NOISE CONTROL. Many Air Force members work the night shift and are sleeping during the
day. Please be considerate of your neighbors' needs.
PARTIES. Complaints concerning noise and parking can be avoided by informing neighbors
prior to the party. Always clean up after any party.

EXESSIVE STEREO/TV/ETC. VOLUMES. Don’t assume that your neighbors enjoy the same
type of music or TV programs that you do. Your stereo or television should not be audible
outside your door or through the walls or ceiling. Please be considerate and keep the volume
turned down at all times. The use of earphones or headsets is recommended.

STORAGE AREAS. Items not stored properly will be tagged. If not claimed or removed
within 2 weeks, items will be disposed of.




SECTION D - SELF-HELP WORK
A self-help project is normally work accomplished by the building or room occupant. Self-help
projects are normally not authorized for mechanical or electrical-related work. The CE self-help
desk will provide you with the materials and tools you need to complete most approved self-help
projects. All materials used in self-help projects must be provided by or approved by CE.

REQUESTING SELF-HELP. You must submit an Air Force Form 332, Base Civil Engineer
Work Request, and have approval prior to commencing any self-help work. As a minimum, you
must coordinate the work request with the appropriate UH management office, the Fire
Department (CSC/CEF), Safety (71 FTW/SEG) and Environmental (CSC/CEV).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. CE will provide technical assistance for accomplishing self-help
projects upon request. The CE self-help desk is located in Bldg 288 and is open from 0800 to
1645 on normal duty days.

DISPOSITION OF IMPROVEMENTS. You will be informed when your work request is
approved and if you can are authorized to leave the self-help project in place when you vacate
your room. If you paint your room and change the color, you must return it to the original color
before you terminate quarters.




SECTION E - MISCELLANEOUS
BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. A business enterprise is defined as a commercial activity conducted
for profit. Written approval must be received from the 71 MSG/CC prior to starting any
business. A package explaining the process may be obtained from the Housing Management
Office (HMO) located in Bldg 4405 Lehr Street. Submit all requests through HMO. HMO will
route your package to the 71 MSG/CC for an approval decision.
SOLICITATION. Solicitation, fund-raising, scout activities, school sales etc, require prior
approval from the 71 MSG/CC. Report any suspected unauthorized solicitors to the Security
Forces.

GAMBLING, BETTING AND LOTTERIES. Gambling, including lotteries and pool games for
money or property, and the sale or purchase of numbered slips, tickets etc. is prohibited in the
UHs.

DECORATING ROOMS. We encourage you to decorate your room, within reason, to suit
your tastes. However, the following restrictions must be followed:

‒   Do not display material with genitals or pubic hair visible
‒   Do not hang or suspend fishnets, parachutes, or other highly combustible items from the
    ceiling, lights, walls, or furniture or use them as room dividers
‒   Do not use nails, staples or tacks to display posters or pictures on government-owned
    furniture
‒   All wall hangings must be attached in a manner to minimize wall damage (recommend
    posters, etc. be framed and hung using standard picture hardware)
‒   Items requiring open flame/burning are prohibited from display or use (candles, incense, etc.)

You may use your own furniture in lieu of the government-provided items. The furniture must
be in good condition. You will be required to remove any items considered potential safety
hazards.

WATERBEDS. Waterbeds are allowed for use in the UHs. If you choose to use a waterbed, the
following requirements must be followed:

‒   You must purchase and maintain an insurance policy which covers damages to your quarters,
    damage to any other quarters that could be affected by water should your waterbed leak,
    structural damage to the UH and damage to personally owned items
‒   A copy of your insurance policy will be provided to the UH management office, along with
    the name, address and phone number of the insurance company
‒   You must sign a disclaimer statement releasing the government of all liability of your
    personal possessions in the event your waterbed does leak and cause damage

Waterbeds will not be used without a liner. Liners should be installed according to the
manufacturer recommendations.

TELEPHONE/CABLE/INTERNET INSTALLATION. You may have telephone and/or cable
TV service, but you are responsible for all expenses for installation and monthly service.
Telephone service, cable TV and internet may be arranged by contacting local companies.
Satellite dishes are not authorized in UH.

CHRISTMAS OR HOLIDAY LIGHTS. Exterior Christmas or holiday lights and decorations are
not allowed in the UHs. You may use lights in your room, but remember to follow fire
prevention guidelines. All lights must be UL approved and used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

PETS. Pets, except for a small aquarium, 20 gallons or less with fish, are not allowed in UHs.
Aquariums must be well maintained and kept clean to prevent offending odors and unhealthy
conditions. You are liable for any damage caused by water from leaking or broken aquariums.

TOBACCO USE POLICY. All UEQ facilities are tobacco free facilities. Tobacco products may
only be used outside in designated tobacco use areas only. All smoking materials should be
disposed of properly (trash after wetting or field-stripping). Disposing of butts improperly is
considered littering and therefore prohibited. Please refer to AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air
Force, for additional information.




SECTION F - FIRE PROTECTION/PREVENTION
Any questions relating to fire prevention or fire safety can be answered by the base Fire
Department at 213-7280. It is essential that you familiarize yourself with the location of the
nearest fire alarm box to your room. Contact the UH office or the Fire Department if you are
unable to locate the box.

FIRE REPORTING. If a fire occurs in your quarters, first sound the alarm by pulling the fire
alarm box nearest your room. Report the fire by dialing emergency 911 on your telephone if
conditions permit. If using a cell phone, tell the operator you are located on Vance AFB before
giving other details. You will be connected to the base Fire Department and Security Forces.
Give the fire alarm operator your name, building number and room number. Do not hang up
until you are sure the information has been received correctly. Report all fires regardless of size.

The following actions must be taken immediately after discovering a fire:

     1)   Warn all other building occupants
     2)   Evacuate all personnel
     3)   Use available fire extinguishers to control the fire
     4)   Close all doors and windows
     5)   Appoint someone to direct the firefighters to the fire

FIRE PREVENTION INSTRUCTIONS.

Smoke Detectors. All UHs have a pre-wired smoke detector installed for your fire safety. The
smoke detectors will provide an alarm only within the room. They are not connected to the
building alarm. Each month, you should perform an operational test of the detector. To do this,
take a pencil and depress the test button on the bottom of the detector. The alarm should sound;
if it does not, contact the UH office immediately.
Heat Detectors. All UH rooms are equipped with a heat detector which activates the building
alarm system and automatically notifies the Fire Department. The heat detectors should not be
tampered with. Do not block, obstruct or hang decorations from either detector.

Fire Extinguishers. All UOQ rooms are equipped with a fire extinguisher. Familiarize yourself
with the location of the fire extinguisher within your room. If you are not trained on the use of
the extinguisher, call the Fire Department, 213-7280, and they will schedule you for the proper
training. Do not tamper with the fire extinguisher. NOTE: UEQ fire extinguishers are located
at conspicuous locations within the hallways, kitchens and laundry rooms.

Sprinkler System. All UH rooms are provided with fire sprinkler devices. Do not tamper or hang
objects from the sprinkler heads. Do not block or tamper with the sprinkler system piping, floor
drain and controls located in the UEQ storage rooms.

Barbecue Grills. Grills should be supervised when lit and should never be left unattended. They
must be a minimum of 15 feet from all structures and combustible items. You must insure the
fire is extinguished after use. Never place hot coals in the trash.

Cooking. You should never leave cooking unattended due to the possibility of fire. Should a
grease fire occur, cover the burning pan with a lid, turn off the appliance and call the Fire
Department. Never attempt to remove the pan from the stove. Never use water! Never use flour
as it can explode.

Housekeeping. Keep trash from accumulating in your quarters by emptying it every day.
Kitchen stoves, sinks, countertops etc. should be kept clean and grease free. Keep the kitchen

purposes. Plastic trash containers should not be used. Exit access should be clear at all times.

Electrical Appliances and Extension Cords. All heat-producing appliances should be equipped
with a thermostat, be UL approved and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The

receptacles. Extension cords should not be extended from the ceilings, walls or light fixtures;
run through holes in the walls, windows or doors; or concealed behind walls or ceilings or
beneath the carpet or floor. Extension cords must be UL approved and be one continuous length
without splices or taped repairs. All multiple outlet devices must have a 16-gauge cord and

SECTION H - SPECIAL CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
Weather conditions vary widely throughout the year and warrant your review and preparations.
Certain types of natural disasters are more common to particular areas of the country than other
areas. Types of natural disasters common to this area are tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hail,
winter storms and floods. Springtime is the period when Vance AFB may experience its most
violent weather. Over half of the total number of tornadoes occurs during the months of April
and May. However, tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year in Oklahoma and at
every hour of the day and night. A secondary peak of tornadoes occurs during October and
November. Winter storm conditions with ice and snow are likely to occur from November
through March. Tune to radio stations, KCRC, AM 1390/FM 96.9, and KGWA, AM 960, for
weather information affecting the base and surrounding communities.

Weather Information. Terminology used to describe severe weather.

       WATCHES - cover an area within 25NM of Vance.
       WARNINGS - cover an area within 5NM of Vance.

Tornado Watch - means conditions are right for tornadoes to develop.

Tornado Warning - means a tornado has actually been sighted in the surrounding area. Local
conditions indicate a tornado could hit the base.

Severe Thunderstorm Watch - means conditions are right for severe thunderstorms to develop.

Severe Thunderstorm Warning - thunderstorms and surface winds greater than 50 knots,
possibility of hail greater than 3/4".

Moderate Thunderstorm Warning - thunderstorms with surface winds of 35-49 knots and/or hail
less than 3/4" in diameter.

Lightning Watch - issued 30 minutes prior to thunderstorms being forecast to move within 5NM
of the airfield.

Wind Warning - surface winds 35 knots or greater not associated with thunderstorms.

Freezing Precipitation Warning - blizzard conditions (packed snow, flurries or drifts), ice, sleet
or freezing rain.

SAFETY AND PREPARATION. Be prepared for adverse weather. Keep food stocked for
emergencies. Have a flashlight, portable radio, blankets and a supply of batteries. Monitor TV
or radio for information after a tornado or severe thunderstorm warning is issued.

Note: The base siren will sound a 3-5 minute steady tone if a tornado is spotted and is a possible
threat to the base. DO NOT try to relocate. TAKE COVER in your building. DO NOT
jeopardize your safety. UOQ occupants should REMAIN in your quarters until the all clear is
announced. UEQ occupants need to take cover in the first floor hallway. SIRENS will not
announce an all clear. If you hear another siren, it means there is another tornado.
SECTION I - ROOM INSPECTIONS
INSPECTIONS. All UH rooms are subject to inspection at anytime. Not being notified of the
coming inspection is not an acceptable excuse for failing the inspection.

INSPECTION NOTIFICATION. After an inspection is scheduled, an E-mail notification may be
sent to the "Dorm Resident" distribution list approximately one week prior to the scheduled
Quarterly Inspection. Failure to send/receive this notification does not constitute an excuse from
the inspection or justification for a room to not be in inspection order.

INSPECTION SCHEDULE. A portion of all UH rooms will be inspected once each quarter,
(Dec, Mar, Jun and Sep). Rooms are chosen at random without regard to the occupant.
Normally, 30% of the rooms are inspected, but this may vary from as little as 5% to as many as
100%. Inspections of rooms displaying "SHIFT WORKER" signs will be scheduled at other-
than the shift worker's "normal" sleeping times. (Each Enlisted room is inspected at least once a
quarter)

INSPECTION PROCEDURES. The group first sergeants will attend the inspections for all
enlisted personnel (regardless of rank) assigned to their group. Inspections for the UOQs will be
conducted by the 71 STUS/CC (Commander) or the 71 STUS/DO (Director of Students). If your
room is inspected, an Individual Room Inspection Result form will be left in your room telling
you who inspected, the date of the inspection and the rating your room received.

INSPECTION STANDARDS. Rooms and contents are subject to inspection. The inspection will
include the concept of safe, healthy, clean, dry, serviceable and tidy and are defined as:

       1)   Safe - no hazardous or unsafe conditions
       2)   Healthy - no potential health risks
       3)   Clean - not soiled, dirty or smelly
       4)   Dry - not wet or damp
       5)   Serviceable - not torn or broken
       6)   Tidy - properly arranged, not cluttered

INSPECTION RATINGS. Rooms will be given a rating of “pass” or “fail” based on the
inspection standards and the degree to which the room either meets or fails to meet the standards.
Ratings are as follows:

   PASS (0-3 Discrepancies) Cleanliness and neatness meets or exceeds standards
   FAIL (4 or more Discrepancies) Does not meet standards

Any room rated failing inspection will be re-inspected. Your first sergeant or commander will
notify you of the date and time of the re-inspection.
Note: Commanders and first sergeants will inspect the exterior areas, storage rooms and
hazardous material storage lockers at the same time as the room inspections. Unauthorized items
may be removed by authorized authorities at this time.




SECTION J - AUTHORIZATION TO RESIDE OFF-BASE
POLICY. Air Force policy requires the base to maintain a minimum occupancy rate of 95% in
the UHs. When we reach or exceed the minimum occupancy, members may be authorized to
reside off base with their commander's approval. The UEQs are for enlisted personnel in the
ranks of E-1 through E-4 (with less than 3 years of service). The UOQs are for UPT students in
the ranks of O-1 and O-2.

HQ AETC requires all unaccompanied UPT students be housed on base to the maximum extent
possible. UPT students accompanied with dependents (spouse and/or children) are authorized to
reside off base and may apply for on-base housing. AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing
Management, along with the AETC and Vance supplements contains guidance on Air Force,
AETC or 71 FTW policies.

For government-paid moves, an AF Form 150 will be issued by the Housing Management Office.
Members must take the move orders (AF Form 150) to TMO for processing within 7 days of
issue or the orders will be canceled. When authorized a paid move, members have a choice of a
government-procured contract move or the member may accomplish the move and be
reimbursed.

UOQ RESIDENTS. All UOQ residents must receive written approval from: 1) 71 STUS/DO or
71 STUS/CC, and 2) the Housing Management Office prior to moving out of the UOQ to

obtain coordination on by your commander (or the 71 STUS/DO for UPT students) and/or first
sergeant and the Housing Management Office.

Once final approval is received, you will have 7 duty days to complete your move to off base,
including cleaning your room. After you have passed the final inspection of your room and
turned in the keys to the appropriate UH management office; the management will complete the
AF Form 594 to increase your BAQ from partial rate to single rate.
