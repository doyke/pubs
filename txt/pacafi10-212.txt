   2.3.1. RHS Commanders (RHS/CCs) are not authorized to accept projects without first
   coordinating with the supported CES Commander (CES/CC), the supported base contracting
   officer, the Numbered Air Force (NAF) civil engineer, and gaining approval from MAJCOM
   level and Air Staff in turn.
   2.3.2. Coordinate all projects through PACAF/A7X that do not require PACAF funding,
   such as work for other commands or services prior to accepting the project.
3. Project Acceptance/Approval Limitations. The following cautions and restrictions apply to
any project being considered for RHS execution:
   3.1. The supported CES/CC will coordinate with the base contracting officer before RED
   HORSE is given a construction project. Do not execute proposed projects in a general
   locality during a time when a surplus of local labor exists for the type of labor skills required
   for the project. This determination is the responsibility of the local project programming or
   approval authority. Include a non-competition statement on the project approval document
   explaining the impact, if any, on local contractor(s) or labor relations as a result of the
   utilization of RED HORSE assets per AFI 10-209.
   3.2. RED HORSE is subject to short notice rapid deployments to support disaster recovery
   operations and/or contingency requirements. RED HORSE will not accept projects if failure
   to accomplish the project by a specific beneficial occupancy date will result in a mission
   failure by the ultimate user of the facility.
4. Project Authorization.
   4.1. Approval authority for all RED HORSE TTPs will be IAW AFI 10-209, AFI 32-1032,
   AFI 32-1012, Reserve Component Facilities Programs, 22 July 1994, AFI 32-1021,
   Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects, 14 June 2010, ACCI
   32-151, and current PACAF established policy as outlined in this PACAFI 10-212. Projects
   scheduled for accomplishment under the provisions of this regulation are requested through
   PACAF/A7X for approval by PACAF/A7. Once project approval is obtained, all projects are
   submitted in turn to ACC/A7X for visibility and coordination purposes IAW AFI 10-209.
   The 554 RHS will develop a proposed TTP schedule each fiscal year (FY) (see suggested
   format Attachment 4) for approval by PACAF/A7. IAW AFI 10-209, once approved and
   incorporated into the consolidated RED HORSE annual TTP by ACC/A7X, PACAF/A7X
   will notify each requester of approved RED HORSE construction projects through a project
   notification letter. Project notification letters will include base, project number, and project
4                                                       PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013


    title. Any proposed cancellation of an approved project (except requester cancellation) must
    be submitted in writing to PACAF/A7X and approved by PACAF/A7. PACAF/A7X will
    notify ACC/A7X of any subsequent cancellation resulting from the request and the master
    RED HORSE TTP program matrix updated by ACC/A7X accordingly.
    4.2. Projects scheduled and not completed during the current FY construction schedule can
    be carried over to the following FY. Requests for out-of-cycle project insertions into the
    RED HORSE schedule will be coordinated through PACAF/A7X for PACAF/A7 approval.
    Any out-of-cycle approvals to PACAF’s TTP program will be communicated to ACC/A7X
    for updating of the master RED HORSE TTP Matrix.
    4.3. After notification of project acceptance for RED HORSE troop construction, the
    CES/CC or designated representative(s) at the requesting installation will develop all
    necessary project documents including DD Form 1391, FY 20__ Military Construction
    Project Data (sample included as Attachment 1); DD Form 1391C, FY 20__ Military
    Construction Project Data (Continued) (if necessary for further project funding
    clarification); Certificate of Environmental Compliance; and AF Form 813, Request for
    Environmental Impact Analysis. Prepare these documents IAW established AF and
    applicable MAJCOM directives for real property projects in the format prescribed in AFI 32-
    1032. The base CES/CC will coordinate all work with the 554 RHS during the project
    approval document preparation stage.
    4.4. The installation commander or an individual to whom real property support
    responsibility has been delegated, must approve the project by signing the DD Forms 1391
    and 1391C (if utilized), with the approved site plan.
    4.5. CES/CCs and others submitting base/wing level approved projects for consideration and
    inclusion in the RED HORSE TTP construction program will forward approved project
    documents to PACAF/A7X and the 554 RHS/CC. Units on a Joint Base will ensure the
    project routing/approval complies with the respective Joint Base MOUs before submission to
    PACAF/A7X. All project documents must have sufficient information to allow an
    independent reviewer to understand the requirement, training benefit, classification of work,
    total cost (funded and unfunded), impact if not accomplished, and project timing
    requirements.
    4.6. Always use the term "troop training" where applicable in the development of all project
    documents.
    4.7. The assigned lead RHS will accomplish an evaluation of the project and provide its
    assessment to the requesting CES/CC with an information copy to PACAF/A7X (suggested
    format in Attachment 2). Evaluations will include as a minimum:
       4.7.1. Statement regarding the value of the project for enhancement of unit training.
       4.7.2. Projected availability of RED HORSE equipment. Requirements for host unit
       equipment or lease/rental equipment, if needed/as applicable.
       4.7.3. Estimated number of personnel and calendar days required to accomplish project.
       4.7.4. Review of funded and unfunded costs for general compliance with scope and troop
       deployment(s).
       4.7.5. Estimated fuel required to support project vehicles and equipment.
PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013                                                                5


     4.7.6. Evaluation of RED HORSE design capability if required.
     4.7.7. Recommended period of accomplishment to include tentative start date.
  4.8. The requesting CES/CC reviews the RED HORSE evaluation, revises project
  documents to match RED HORSE estimates, and sends a copy of the approved project
  documents (including the RED HORSE evaluation) to PACAF/A7X with an information
  copy to the assigned lead RHS.
  4.9. PACAF/A7X will forward copies of approved project documents to PACAF/A7P to
  review work classification and project approval limits. Once approved by PACAF/A7,
  courtesy copies of the project documentation will be forwarded to ACC/A7X IAW AFI 10-
  209, for inclusion in the overall AF RED HORSE TTP program matrix.
  4.10. Procedures in paragraphs 4.3 through 4.6 above also apply to revised project
  documents. Additionally, requesting CES/CC and the assigned lead RHS should periodically
  review accuracy of programmed costs. This is particularly important when the project start
  date is not soon after preparation of project documents.
  4.11. Procedures for obtaining RED HORSE project consideration and authorization from
  MAJCOMs requesting PACAF RED HORSE support are as follows:
     4.11.1. Requesting MAJCOM will forward DD Forms 1391 and 1391C, as applicable, to
     PACAF/A7X. After an initial review, PACAF/A7X will forward project documents to
     PACAF/A7P to review.
     4.11.2. Upon review and coordination by PACAF/A7P, PACAF/A7X will forward
     reviewed documents to unit level to ensure the 554 RHS has ample opportunity to review
     the project as presented in documentation and develop its assessment of its training value
     and other criteria as outlined in paragraph 4.7.1 through 4.7.7 of this PACAFI.
     4.11.3. PACAF RED HORSE, upon completion of its evaluation of the selected
     project(s) IAW paragraph 4.7 above, will send their acceptance and/or any subsequent
     recommendations to the requesting CES/CC with info copy to PACAF/A7X.
     4.11.4. After notification of project acceptance for RED HORSE construction,
     requesting CES/CC will prepare project documents IAW instructions in paragraph 4.8
     above and obtain project approval and funding at appropriate level.
     4.11.5. The appropriate MAJCOM or base will forward a copy of the approved project
     document to PACAF/A7X, 25 E. Street, Suite B-306, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam
     HI 96853 with an information copy to ACC/A7X and the 554 RHS. PACAF/A7X will
     review documents for sufficiency and coordinate with the appropriate RHS leadership for
     work directive. PACAF/A7 will forward DD Forms 1391 and 1391C to AF/A7C for
     approval on projects exceeding MAJCOM approval authority IAW AFI 32-1032 and AFI
     10-209. See Attachment 3 for additional requirements and major troop training process
     milestones. Once PACAF has formally accepted the project for 554 RHS participation,
     PACAF/A7X will provide a copy to ACC/A7X to ensure the project is listed in the
     master AF RED HORSE TTP matrix showing PACAF 554 RHS support.

5. Unit Home Station Work Authorization.
     5.1. In the event a local/home station construction project becomes an unexpected major
     base priority, a streamlined out-of-cycle process for unit/home station projects is authorized.
     The 554 RHS/CC, responding to the requirement, can submit to PACAF/A7X for expedited
     approval of such work orders which have significant training value within MAJCOM project
     approval authority limits using an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Order. The 554
     RHS/CC must review and consider existing squadron TTP commitments, exercises,
     inspections and AOR deployment requirements, to determine if the “late” project(s) can be
     supported without adverse impact to the existing commitments prior to submission to
     PACAF. If approved at MAJCOM level for 554 RED HORSE participation and execution,
     the late project(s) must be scheduled so they do not delay completion or participation in any
     previously programmed AF/A7C, ACC/A7X or PACAF/A7X approved TTP(s)/exercises,
     inspections or real world contingencies the unit is already programmed to support.
     5.2. Initiation, approval, and accomplishment of RED HORSE cantonment maintenance of a
     job order nature may be delegated to the 554 RHS by the CES/CC in accordance with current
     guidance provided by the Joint Region on accomplishment of this type work. Specific
     authority and responsibilities will be identified in a written agreement on a case by case basis
     if needed IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, 1 May 2005.
6. Project Scheduling.
     6.1. The RHS/CC will furnish PACAF/A7X and the supported bases with a current project
     listing and tentative schedule prior to the start of the new fiscal year. The supported CES/CC
     will ensure all necessary pre-construction actions are completed (design, if required, written
     Federal, state, and local environmental compliance approval, procure materials and
     accommodations) to ensure project(s) start on the scheduled date. Lodge RED HORSE
     teams on base whenever possible, as temporary duty (TDY) costs are part of the funded
     portion of the project and thus subject to statutory limitations. Depending on application, per
     AFI 65-601, Volume 1, TDY costs could be part of the funded portion of the project and thus
     subject to statutory limitations, and possible PACAF cuts to meet sequestration requirements.
7. Project Design.
     7.1. During the RED HORSE evaluation of the project documents, RED HORSE will
     determine if engineering work hours and expertise are needed and if so, whether they are
     available within RED HORSE for project design. If design is required, careful consideration
     should be given to accomplishing a sufficient number of designs to ensure the RED HORSE
     engineering flight is adequately trained in each engineering discipline and overall project
     technical administration (drawings, current working estimate, etc.). Include TDY costs for
     evaluation or design of PACAF projects as an unfunded line item in the DD Form 1391C.
     TDY costs for evaluation or design of all non-PACAF projects are funded by the base or
     parent MAJCOM. The supported CES/CC will ensure funding is available for completion of
     the design work for those projects RED HORSE determines it does not have the manpower
     and/or expertise to design prior to RED HORSE accepting the project for TTP consideration.
     7.2. Upon completion of project design, the RHS/CC and base CES/CC will review copies
     of the project design, AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, bill of materials, copy of the civil
     engineer material acquisition system inquiry for work order materials or copies of AF Form
PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    7


   1445, Materials and Equipment List, and current working estimate (CWE). Project reviews
   are to ensure technical and functional adequacy, all the required signatures have been
   obtained, and materials ordered.
8. Project Management. For projects covered by this instruction, RED HORSE and the
supported CES/CC will assume the following responsibilities in addition to those identified in
AFI 10-209 and the established RED HORSE Project Engineer/Project Management Guide
issued by the 823rd RED HORSE Squadron:
   8.1. Assign technical inspection responsibilities to a project liaison officer, by letter to RED
   HORSE, with sufficient skills and authority to accomplish the following duties:
       8.1.1. Act as CES/CC liaison with RED HORSE and other base agencies.
       8.1.2. Coordinate preparation of all funding and project approval documents with
       appropriate base agencies.
       8.1.3. Prepare AF Form 9 or electronic equivalent for materials, services, or rental
       equipment as needed.
       8.1.4. Establish bill of materials (BoM) and coordinate material acquisition with
       appropriate base agencies.
       8.1.5. Coordinate use of supported base/CES heavy equipment, shops, tools, and
       vehicles.
       8.1.6. Convene a preconstruction conference with the supported agency, RED HORSE
       project manager, engineer, inspector, and other required agencies prior to work start date.
       8.1.7. Monitor the status of supported base/CES government-furnished material and
       equipment. Ensure the approved project BoMs received is 100 percent complete prior to
       construction start date; otherwise the RHS/CC may reschedule the project start date or
       recommend cancellation of the project in its entirety to PACAF/A7. PACAF/A7 will
       cancel projects if materials, funds, or inadequate/faulty or lack of design impede project
       accomplishment.
       8.1.8. Check quality of construction and workmanship. Although the primary purpose of
       RED HORSE projects is for troop training, all work must meet or exceed industry
       standards to be acceptable at completion for utilization and/or occupancy.
       8.1.9. Determine design and construction deficiencies that could impair intended
       functional use of the facility or project.
       8.1.10. Maintain the following in a project jacket file and furnish to RED HORSE 30
       days prior to start of work: AF Form 332 , copy of approved DD Forms 1391 and 1931c
       to include certificate of environmental compliance; AF Form 813, plus the current status
       of Federal, state, and local environmental approvals as required, site plan, project
       drawings; AF Form 103, Base Civil Engineering Work Clearance Request, all pertinent
       AF Form 9 copies, AF Form 1445, CWE and other pertinent data.
       8.1.11. Conduct pre-final and final acceptance inspections with RED HORSE and other
       required agencies to identify project/construction/as built drawing/administrative
       deficiencies and the necessary actions to correct them.

       8.1.12. Follow up to ensure proper corrective action(s) on all identified deficiencies are
       addressed.
    8.2. The RED HORSE Commander will assign a project engineer/officer-in-charge (OIC)
    through the chief of engineering for each project whose responsibilities will include the
    following:
       8.2.1. Act as a liaison with the local CES/CC throughout the project.
       8.2.2. Aid on-site project manager with responsibilities as outlined below.
       8.2.3. Review and approve deviations from original design.
       8.2.4. Attend pre-construction conference.
       8.2.5. Attend pre-final inspection.
    8.3. The RED HORSE Commander will assign a project manager/non-commissioned
    officer-in-charge (NCOIC) through the chief of operations for each project whose
    responsibilities will include the following:
       8.3.1. Coordinate arrival of equipment and manpower with the CES. 30 days prior to a
       deployment; ensure project design, vehicles, materials, billeting, and messing are
       available to support the deployment(s) and notify PACAF/A7X of any unresolved
       problems encountered.
       8.3.2. Prior to start of work:
           8.3.2.1. Provide project liaison officer with a project schedule of activities (e.g., MS
           Project®, CPM, PERT, bar graph, etc.).
           8.3.2.2. Inventory BoM to verify all items are on hand.
       8.3.3. Attend preconstruction conference.
       8.3.4. Ensure both quality of workmanship and final product meet or exceed national
       construction standards.
       8.3.5. Maintain project folder on the job site containing copies of AF Form 332; project
       drawings, specific matters of applicability, BoMs or copies of AF Form 1445 material
       status; copy of approved DD Forms 1391 and 1931c. Also, include AF Form 103;
       project schedule of activities (e.g., CPM, PERT, bar graph, etc.); record of funded and
       unfunded projects costs to date; CWE; Construction Inspection Diary; up-to-date as-built
       drawings; copy of final DD Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real
       Property; and other pertinent data.
       8.3.6. Arrange for pre-final inspection of the project. At the conclusion of the
       inspection, establish a deficiency list to note construction and design deficiencies IAW
       AFI 32-1023, Designing and Constructing Military Construction Projects, 21 April 2010.
       The RED HORSE project manager, the CES representative, and the supported agency
       will sign the deficiency list. If disagreement occurs between the RED HORSE project
       manager and the inspector concerning correction of deficiencies, the base chief of
       engineering will have final authority for acceptance of the work.
PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   9


      8.3.7. Upon resolution of deficiencies, schedule a final inspection for the CES supported
      agency and RED HORSE project manager.
      8.3.8. Provide complete as-built drawings and DD Form 1354 to host CES/CC.
   8.4. The RHS is responsible for maintaining current status and a project file for each
   approved project. Project engineers are responsible for continuously reviewing the project
   files for each of their assigned projects to ensure the file is current and pertinent documents
   are in the file.
9. Project Cost Accounting. The local CES and RED HORSE have a joint requirement in the
collection and reporting of project costs, to include the following:
   9.1. The host CES will:
      9.1.1. Ensure project costs do not exceed approved funded and unfunded amounts
      without prior approval from MAJCOM (PACAF/A7X for PACAF projects).
      9.1.2. Ensure project costs do not exceed statutory limits. If project costs appear to be
      reaching said limits, local CES/CC and RED HORSE project engineer will identify
      portions of work to be eliminated and/or alternatives to keep costs below limits.
      PACAF/A7X will be notified of any changes.
      9.1.3. Provide data base access to designated RHS personnel and establish a work order
      for each project with appropriate cost accounting of all Construction in Progress (CIP) in
      The Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES) and the Interim Work Information
      Management System (IWIMS) which interfaces with ACES for project work order
      management. Follow the general guidance applicable to the AF RED HORSE
      community as a whole provided in ACCI 32-151 for managing projects and cost
      accounting for RED HORSE. Input and track requirements against the work order on a
      weekly basis and in addition to the all inclusive funded cost data entries in ACES and
      IWIMS, as a cross-check, provide sufficient project cost documentation from the
      supported/base level to the supporting RHS functional for inclusion in their unit level
      project funds tracking via MS Project® or Individual Project Tracker v2.1 to minimize
      any potential for project cost overruns.
      9.1.4. Issue an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA), for miscellaneous costs,
      base service store cards, servo-plates, and tool issue cards chargeable to the project as
      necessary.
      9.1.5. Prepare completed construction transfer documents. The CES/CC will prepare an
      AF Form 1442, Real Property Engineering Data, upon final acceptance to transfer
      accountability of completed new construction to real property records. Project cost
      records will provide pertinent information for capitalization to CES real property and/or
      cost accounting records dependent upon project classification.
      9.1.6. Within 30 days after completion of all RED HORSE work, verify estimated per
      diem and travel costs accrued and submit final project status report to PACAF/A7X.
      9.1.7. Estimate project funds required to finish the FY and return the remainder to
      PACAF/A7R (or other funding MAJCOM) 30 days prior to the end of the FY. Host base
      will program sufficient funds at the beginning of the new FY to complete the project if
      necessary.
10                                                     PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013


  9.2. RED HORSE will:
     9.2.1. Maintain a daily inspection diary on AF Form 1477, Construction Inspection
     Record. Make inspections daily, to include weekends and holidays, as appropriate and
     maintain project inspection records in a folder to track and document the quality of real
     property construction. On non-work days, indicate this with an entry for the day's report.
     Include the following information in the daily inspection diary:
        9.2.1.1. Name/number of project.
        9.2.1.2. RED HORSE project OIC/NCOIC.
        9.2.1.3. Date.
        9.2.1.4. Weather conditions.
        9.2.1.5. Number of personnel assigned on project, hours they work, and their trade.
        9.2.1.6. Work accomplished on the project.
        9.2.1.7. Actual or potential delays on the project, cause, and action taken to correct
        them.
        9.2.1.8. Injury(s) Date,Time, copy of Accident report.
     9.2.2. Request separate AF Form 616 from the benefiting base for TDY and convoy
     costs prior to deployment.
        9.2.2.1. Return the AF Form 616 for TDY costs to the issuing office after publishing
        all orders or upon expiration of AF Form 616. Forward all copies of TDY orders to
        the accountable finance office (office that issued the authority).
        9.2.2.2. AF Form 616 for convoy costs (fuel, oil, emergency repairs, etc.) must be
        annotated with the costs incurred. Return AF Form 616 with supporting obligating
        documents either upon expiration or completion of the project but NLT the expiration
        date on AF Form 616 to the accountable office.
     9.2.3. Track all costs for the project, (funded and unfunded) utilizing Microsoft Project®
     or Individual Project Tracker v2.1. Maintain hard copy files of all expenditures and
     provide sufficient supporting documentation to the supported host CES/CC and work in
     conjunction with the host CES/CC to ensure all funded project costs are entered into
     ACES and IWIMS on a weekly basis to maximize project funded cost visibility at all
     levels and minimize the potential of “under-reporting” project expenditures and the
     possibility of exceeding approved project funding limits.
     9.2.4. Maintain fiscal responsibility for the project costs as they occur and project future
     expenditures, which reflects the best estimates, to ensure the project does not exceed the
     approved project funding limit.
     9.2.5. Adhere to the directive guidance in AFI 65-601 Volume 1 when developing cost
     projections for an operations and maintenance (O&M) project, military labor should be
     identified as an "unfunded cost" and listed as such on the project DD form 1391. Even
     though it is not counted against the funding limitations ($750K or up to $1.5M for
     Life/Health/Safety) for "O&M minor construction," it must be listed and considered in
     determining who has the "final approval authority for the project." Items that are not
PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  11


      military labor (travel, per diem, equipment rental, etc.) are funded costs and must be
      shown as such on DD form 1391 and counted against the funding limitations assigned to
      the project.
          9.2.5.1. Once an O&M minor construction project has been approved, per AFI 65-
          601 Volume 1, the following paragraph and its referenced sub paragraphs to account
          for in-house labor applies:
          9.2.5.2. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 9.14.3 and its inclusive sub paragraphs
          9.14.3.1 thru 9.14.3.13. (Exceptions are in paragraph 9.15. of the same AFI) apply to
          this PACAFI. Charge all funded costs accordingly to the applicable military
          construction appropriation. All costs attributable to the project listed on the approved
          DD form 1391 and 1391C are to be recorded and tracked. However, ALL
          MILITARY LABOR IS TO BE CONSIDERED AN "UNFUNDED" COST AND
          AS SUCH DOES NOT REDUCE IN ANY WAY FROM THE APPROVED
          PROJECT ALLOCATION LIMIT, up to $750K for O&M minor military
          construction. There is no differentiation on military labor in AFI 65-601, Volume 1.
          Branches of Service, AD, ANG or Reserves are viewed as military equals, all one and
          the same for construction purposes and funding cost accounting. As such, “military
          labor,” regardless of the sourcing, is considered UNFUNDED and although "tracked
          as a construction cost item" does not count against the actual construction project
          ceiling limitations.
          9.2.5.3. Addressing travel and per diem costs: If ARC (ANG and AFRC) support is
          in an augmentation and training capacity and not the "Lead Construction Agent"
          (LCA) related to the project, any and all of their travel and associated per diem costs
          will not be applied or reimbursed by the funded project. Per AFI 65-601 V1,
          paragraph 9.14.3. regarding funded project costs, and specifically sub paragraph
          9.14.3.10 (POC: PACAF/FMA).
10. Supported Base – Responsibilities
   10.1. Will forward all necessary information to the RED HORSE vehicle maintenance
   section for use in updating vehicle maintenance and fuel consumption records.
   10.2. Will establish a separate Project Funds Management Report (PFMR) account and
   Emergency Special Project (ESP) suffixes to the CES Responsibility Center/Cost Center
   (RC/CC) code prior to incurring any expenditure against the project. Use these codes on all
   servo-plates, AF Form 1445, etc., charged to the project. Standard shop codes with an
   organizational code assigned specifically to the project may be used. By establishing these
   codes, expenditures for fuel, supplies, equipment rental, Contractor Operated Civil Engineer
   Supply Store (COCESS), Contractor Operated Parts Store (COPARS), etc., will be
   summarized on the D-11 report and on a monthly RC Manager's Engineering Support
   Program Report (ESPR) . Request inquiries on this report as required and work with the
   local CES/CC to ensure data base access and all project costs are tracked as outlined in
   paragraph 8.1.2 of this instruction.
   10.3. Will furnish RED HORSE an obligation authority for convoy expenses, travel, and per
   diem prior to deployment. The 554 RHS will use their commercial credit cards while on
12                                                    PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013


  convoy. RED HORSE will return AF Form 616 to the accountable station and receipts to the
  unit’s host station.
  10.4. In regard to RED HORSE proficiency training and associated training costs, the
  supported base RHS/CC and/or CES CC with a recognized need for refresher or upgrade
  training by AFS for their squadron personnel can request manning opportunities for training
  on the TTP program. This request must be from the RHS/CC or CES/CC and cannot be
  delegated. If the supporting RHS/CC concurs, these supported base personnel may be
  assigned to the project over and above the required manning levels defined on the approved
  DD Form 1391. Coming from the supported base, these additional personnel will not incur
  any travel and per diem costs. However their man-hours and associated man-hour costs will
  be tracked and listed with the total aggregate of military man-hours expended on the project
  and the total actual military man-hour cost exempted from depleting the project funding cap
  in any way.
  10.5. PACAF will fund approved PACAF projects directly supporting RED HORSE troop
  training. Use project funds for per diem, travel, contract billets, construction material, and
  vehicle or construction equipment operating and rental costs. The unit may use PACAF
  O&M funds for contract work or materials supporting RED HORSE work. Major equipment
  repair costs that occur during the project are excluded from these funds.
     10.5.1. For non PACAF selected TTPs, host base squadron or other MAJCOM will
     provide funds to support RED HORSE TDY, reconstitution funds (if RED HORSE
     equipment is utilized), transportation of equipment and over-the-road costs, if applicable,
     via fund citation or other acceptable documentation. Guidance for funding RED HORSE
     TDY is stated in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 10.2.
     10.5.2. Use project funds to cover minor maintenance on deployed RED HORSE
     vehicles. RHSs generally fund major repairs from their O&M budget. Minor
     maintenance includes tune-ups, oil changes, replacing minor components, etc. If project
     management makes a decision to fund minor vehicle repairs from project funds, those
     costs must then be annotated in the records as a funded cost against the project’s
     approved statutory limits. Major repairs or heavy maintenance includes work such as
     rebuilding engines, replacing transfer cases, etc. Some repair or heavy maintenance work
     could be paid for by project funds if the circumstances warrant. For example, if a loader
     tire wore out through use on more than one project, RED HORSE will pay for its
     replacement. However, if the tire wore out at an accelerated pace due to unusual site
     conditions, project funds would pay for the replacement. Typical minor maintenance and
     repair work that would be paid for with project funds include, but is not necessarily
     limited to items listed in paragraphs 10.5.2.1 and 10.5.2.2.
         10.5.2.1. Additional examples of minor repair and replacement of minor components
         chargeable to an O&M minor construction project designated as a TTP:
             10.5.2.1.1. Lights/Mirrors.
             10.5.2.1.2. Windshield wipers.
             10.5.2.1.3. Fuel pump.
             10.5.2.1.4. Filter elements.
PACAFI10-212 13 DECEMBER 2013                                                              13


             10.5.2.1.5. Fan belts.
             10.5.2.1.6. Starter solenoid.
             10.5.2.1.7. Voltage regulator.
             10.5.2.1.8. Batteries.
         10.5.2.2. Examples of minor repair of major components chargeable to an O&M
         minor construction project designated as a TTP:
             10.5.2.2.1. Engine (—replace injector lines).
             10.5.2.2.2. Transfer case (—adjust linkage).
             10.5.2.2.3. Transmission (—change filters).
             10.5.2.2.4. Front and rear axle assembly (— change oil).
             10.5.2.2.5. Rear suspension assembly (—replace worn bolts).
  10.6. Reconstitution Policy: Policy formalizes the methodology used by project planners to
  compute reconstitution costs. Reconstitution costs are included as a funded cost on DD Form
  1391C. A flat rate policy has been implemented beginning with the FY02 program. For
  CONUS projects, four percent of the project’s total BoM will be budgeted and included on
  the front page of DD Form 1391 to cover reconstitution costs. For overseas projects, eight
  percent will be used. A higher percentage is used for overseas projects due to the operating
  environment, length of deployment, and historical cost data. Reconstitution funds will be
  sent to host base. The host base is responsible for funding reconstitution cost to RED
  HORSE equipment used in the project. Other project funds will be sent to the base.
  Reconstitution funds are allocated to fund the minor maintenance costs as outlined in
  paragraphs 10.5.2.1 and 10.5.2.2.
     10.6.1. Units will track annual reconstitution costs captured under ESP Code which will
     be established in association with “Command Funded RED HORSE Projects
     Reconstitution.”
     10.6.2. IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1, funded project costs include but are not limited to:
         10.6.2.1. Materials.
         10.6.2.2. Travel.
         10.6.2.3. Transportation.
         10.6.2.4. Maintenance and operation of government equipment.
         10.6.2.5. Contractor services.
  10.7. RED HORSE projects accomplished for other commands are funded by the command
  for which the project is being accomplished. The funds required will be that amount of
  funded cost identified on the approved DD Forms 1391 and 1391C, plus the TDY cost of any
  preliminary evaluations or design as described in paragraph 3.7 and 6.1. Reconstitution fee
  applies to all projects accomplished by PACAF RHS.

11. Project Training
   11.1. PACAF/A7X will develop a 24-month training project program for the Pacific theater
   and coordinate with AFRC/A7X and NGB/ANG A7X to determine/coordinate their units
   ability to participate in order to identify funds required for the ensuing FY and program
   project funds in the appropriate budget categories as specified by current financial
   management guidance. Use only funded costs as shown on the project document (DD Forms
   1391 and 1391C) for budget purposes. Total funds required to complete a training project is
   the aggregate sum of the funded costs.
