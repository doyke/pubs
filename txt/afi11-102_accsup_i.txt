                                                 Chapter 1

                  INTRODUCTION, COMPLIANCE, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Introduction and Background. The Air Force Flying Hour Program consists of the flying hours
necessary to train aircrews to safely operate their aircraft and sustain them in numbers sufficient to exe-
cute their core tasked mission. The Air Force Flying Hour Model (AFFHM) provides the methodology
and processes that MAJCOMs will use to build their flying hour programs. This model determines the
number of flying hours needed to attain and maintain combat readiness for all aircrews, test weapons and
tactics, and fulfill collateral requirements. The Joint Mission Essential Task List, the Air Force task lists,
and the MDS-specific volumes of the AFI 11-2 series are the foundational requirements that link aircrew
training to tasks required to support the warfighting CINCs. The centrality of the flying hour program to
the United States Air Force’s readiness and combat capability cannot be overemphasized. For this reason
it must be defendable and auditable. To that end, it must be standard across the Air Force, be connected to
readiness indicators, based on the train-to-task concept, easily understood, and most importantly, be based
upon the requirements to train and experience aircrews to perform Air Force missions.
    1.1.1. The intent of this instruction is to provide a common methodology and structure for determin-
    ing flying hour requirements while acknowledging unique MAJCOM requirements. The depiction of
    the model and the requirements of this instruction are such that they capture the necessary differences
    in the sortie-based, event-based and throughput-based flying hour programs of the combat, mobility,
    and formal training forces.

1.2. Applicability and Compliance. Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard
will use The AFFHM described in this instruction. Flying hour requirements based on operational mis-
sions or Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) will comply with the intent of the model.

1.3. Responsibilities . AF/XOOT is the office of primary responsibility for the AFFHM and is the
approval authority for suggested changes. MAJCOM and ANG Directors of Operations are responsible
for MAJCOM models.
    1.3.1. The lead command establishes the training basis for all mission design series (MDS) aircraft in
    its inventory. User commands must use the same flying hour computations. See AFPD 10-9, Lead
    Operating Command Weapon Systems Management, for further information.
    1.3.1. (ACC) HQ ACC/A3TB will:
       1.3.1.1. (Added-ACC) Manage the ACC Flying Hour Program (FHP).
       1.3.1.2. (Added-ACC) Provide ACC's recommended FHP to HQ USAF in accordance with AFI
       11-101.
       1.3.1.3. (Added-ACC) Coordinate FHPs with other staff agencies for validation.
       1.3.1.4. (Added-ACC) Validate the Reliability and Maintainability Information System
       (REMIS) data.
       1.3.1.5. (Added-ACC) Monitor individual unit flying hour accomplishments on a monthly basis.
       Manage records created IAW the AF RDS. Contact local records managers as needed.
AFI11-102_ACCSUP_I 7 JUNE 2007                                                                           5


       1.3.1.6. (Added-ACC) Coordinate all flying hour program change requests through Air Combat
       Command Director of Air and Space Operations (ACC/A3) for approval.
       1.3.1.7. (Added-ACC) Conduct Staff Assistance Visits to each unit as required to be determined
       by ACC/A3T.
   1.3.2. (Added-ACC) Flying organizations will:
       1.3.2.1. (Added-ACC) Operational Support Squadron commander or designee will appoint pri-
       mary and alternate Flying Hour POCs who will report flying hours to HQ ACC/A3TB. These indi-
       viduals will be appointed for a minimum of one year and will receive training at the next ACC
       Flying Hour Symposium.
       1.3.2.2. (Added-ACC) Ensure flying squadrons plan and execute unit flying hour programs as
       separate elements of the parent unit's program.
       1.3.2.3. (Added-ACC) Submit an annual FHP in accordance with paragraph 2.4.1. (Added)
       1.3.2.4. (Added-ACC) Submit RCS: A3TB(M) 7101 to HQ ACC/A3TB as early as the 5th but no
       later than the 10th calendar day of each month via e-mail.
       1.3.2.5. (Added-ACC) Submit RCS: A3TB(M) 7102 to HQ ACC/A3TB to report monthly flying
       hours via Flying Hours on Line (FHOL) by the 10th calendar day of each month.
       1.3.2.6. (Added-ACC) The unit’s operations officer will ensure completed AFTO 781’s are
       delivered to the Squadron Aviation Resource Manager (SARM) office not later than the morning
       after the date of flight. SARM’s will validate each day’s sorties and hours flown with maintenance
       debrief personnel daily. SARM personnel will validate daily/weekly AUR’s and return correct or
       adjusted AUR’s to maintenance debrief. OSS representatives will validate weekly/monthly totals
       and ensure FHOL is updated. The purpose of the reviews is to identify and correct errors on post
       mission paperwork (to include inaccurate time and/or mission symbols) and ensure AFTO Form
       781 data input into IMDS, ARMS, and FHOL reflects actual data.
       1.3.2.7. (Added-ACC) Solicit feedback from HQ ACC/A3TB as required.

1.4. The AFFHM is composed of 5 core components: Force Structure, Aircrew Data, Requirements, Cal-
culation, and Summary (Figure 2.1.). For operational flying units the relationship of these components
expresses the mathematical description: force structure determines the number of pilots, pilots multiplied
by requirements determine the number of flying hours. For formal training units the mathematical
description is: average daily student load multiplied by the average number of flying hours per student per
day, multiplied by the number of training days determines the number of required student flying hours,
which determines force structure. MAJCOMs may add other functions to the model as long as its core
structure remains intact.
1.5. (Added-ACC) Flying Hour Program (FHP):
   1.5.1. (Added-ACC) The ACC FHP represents a considerable fiscal commitment and directly affects
   the readiness of aircrews in the Combat Air Forces (CAF). Future command flying hour requirements
   are incorporated into the USAF Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and are included in the
   USAF Program Document, Aerospace Vehicles and Flying Hours (PA).
6                                                               AFI11-102_ACCSUP_I 7 JUNE 2007


    1.5.2. (Added-ACC) Unit flying hour allocations are derived from a combination of factors to
    include mission tasking, aircrew training requirements, unit equipment, alert commitment, aircrew
    ratio, staff requirements, etc. These factors determine a rate of flying necessary to maintain combat
    capability that is expressed as an aircraft utilization rate (UTE).
    1.5.3. (Added-ACC) Flying hour goals are cumulative values to be achieved by the end of the fiscal
    year. The planning and execution of individual monthly programs toward this yearly goal is a unit
    responsibility. Except for emergencies or Higher Headquarters (HHQ) tasking at year-end (e.g., hurri-
    cane evacuations or air sovereignty scrambles), UNIT FLYING HOUR PROGRAMS WILL NOT
    BE OVERFLOWN by more than 20 hours per MDS WITHOUT PRIOR HHQ APPROVAL. Unit
    commanders are not required to "zero out" their annual flying hour program at the end of the fiscal
    year. The last flying day of the year should be planned and flown as a normal flying day and should
    not be truncated solely because the annual flying hour contract has been satisfied. Procedures for
    requesting changes to annual contracts are outlined in paragraph 2.4.2. (Added) of this supplement.
    1.5.4. (Added-ACC) REMIS is the official USAF flying hour report IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment
    Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting; and AFM 66-279V1, Core Automated Maintenance Sys-
    tem (CAMS). The importance of accurate and timely flying hour utilization reporting through CAMS
    and REMIS cannot be overemphasized. Erroneous reporting may result in the loss of required fund-
    ing, personnel authorizations, and supplies.

                        THE AIR FORCE SINGLE FLYING HOUR MODEL

2.1. Force Structure. See Attachment 2 for examples. This component is the input site for Primary Air-
craft Inventory (PAI) and crew ratio, and is used to determine the number of Aircrew Position Indicator
(API) 1 pilots. This data may be portrayed by fleet or by unit, at MAJCOM discretion. For pilot produc-
tion, no input is required because force structure is a function of the student load

Figure 2.1. The Air Force Single Flying Hour Model.




See Attachment 7 for additional example of Single Flying Hour Model
2.1.2. (Added-ACC) Aircraft Authorizations:
       2.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) HQ USAF specifies the Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI) for
       each ACC unit in the USAF Programs: PA, Aerospace Vehicles and Flying Hours; and PD, Bases,
       Units, and Priorities.
       2.1.2.2. (Added-ACC) Units projected to possess less aircraft than authorized may be assigned a
       revised PMAI, or Chargeable Aircraft Authorization (CHRG) for Utilization (UTE) and flying
       hour computations. The CHRG will be displayed for each applicable unit in ACC's allocation
       messages.

2.2. Aircrew Data. See Attachment 3 for examples. This component is the input site for the types and
number of aircrew members that need to be trained. It includes calculations that result in the number of
specific aircrew members (i.e., pilots, navigators, boom operators) that require flying training by position
and category. The crew position that drives the greatest number of flying hours is the total requirement.
The number of aircrew members is usually derived from crew ratio and PAI in the force structure compo-
nent. The number of overhead aircrew members is determined by manpower standards. For pilot produc-
tion, this data is derived from production goals and average daily student load.
   2.2.1. Position and category of aircrew members and other pertinent aircrew data include but are not
   limited to:
       2.2.1.1. API 1 Aircraft Commanders, First Pilots and Copilots
       2.2.1.2. API 2 Navigators
       2.2.1.3. API 6 and 8 staff and supervisory positions at wing level and above
       2.2.1.4. Experience mix
       2.2.1.5. Instructor Pilots and Supervisors
8                                                                  AFI11-102_ACCSUP_I 7 JUNE 2007


       2.2.1.6. In-unit Requalifications
       2.2.1.7. Number of projected upgrades
       2.2.1.8. Number of aircrews requiring special qualifications
       2.2.1.9. Pilot production goals
       2.2.1.10. Average daily student load
       2.2.1.11. Number and experience mix of instructor pilots

2.3. Requirements. See Attachment 4 for examples. This is the input site for the type, number, and/or
duration of annual aircrew flying training requirements by aircrew position and category as well as oper-
ational mission requirements derived from appropriate tasking documents. Requirements include those
events associated with Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT), initial and mission qualification training,
continuation training, upgrade, requalification, and special capability training events/sorties that aircrews
must accomplish during the training cycle. Requirements may also include missions performed in support
of operational users. Requirement sources include AFI 11-2 MDS and major command Ready Aircrew
Program (RAP) messages, and MAJCOM and Numbered Air Force instructions and OPLANs.
    2.3.1. Because of mission and training differences, training requirement computations should remain
    sortie-based for CAF aircraft and event-based for helicopters, airlift and tanker aircraft. In cases where
    an MDS is operated by different MAJCOMs (C-130Es operated by AMC, PACAF and USAFE), the
    lead command’s methodology takes precedence.
    2.3.1. (ACC) Flying Hour Program Development and Management.
       2.3.1.1. (Added-ACC) Budget Activity (BA) Group. Flying hours and funds are assigned to HQ
       ACC by HQ USAF under two BAs; Operating Forces (BA01), and Administrative and Ser-
       vice-wide Activities (BA04). Within each BA, flying hours are allocated by MDS and Program
       Element Code (PEC). Each MDS and PEC combination is assigned a separate account managed
       by ACC and reported to HQ USAF. Hours and funding may not be transferred from one BA to
       another without HQ USAF approval.
       2.3.1.2. (Added-ACC) Units with flying hours in more than one PEC will manage each account
       separately. Only HQ ACC has the authority to transfer flying hours between PECs in the same
       BA. Units will only use and report flying time under the PECs assigned to them by HQ ACC.
       Coordination will be established in the above mentioned MOA between the Operations and the
       CAMS Data Base Managers to ensure the utilization codes are loaded against the correct PEC in
       the CAMS database.
       2.3.1.3. (Added-ACC) UTE Requirements. ACC will determine an annual Sortie UTE to each
       flying hour program. The UTE is expressed in sorties per aircraft per month. The UTE require-
       ment may vary for each unit and MDS depending on each unit’s situation.
       2.3.1.4. (Added-ACC) Average Sortie Duration (ASD). ASD is used to convert sorties to flying
       hours and vice versa. HQ ACC/A3TB uses the unit's last programmed ASD when initially deter-
       mining flying hour programs for the current and future years. Units will update their ASDs annu-
       ally to reflect the unit's best estimate of the optimum sortie duration after considering historical
       experience, changes in missions or mix of missions, distance to ranges, deployments, etc.
AFI11-102_ACCSUP_I 7 JUNE 2007                                                                         9


     2.3.1.5. (Added-ACC) Initial Program Submission. By the end of May HQ ACC/A3 will provide
     the units a projection for the upcoming fiscal year inputs through a “Proposed FHP” message.. HQ
     ACC/A3TB will formulate the next year's projected allocation for each unit and MDS using infor-
     mation from HQ ACC staff agencies, historical unit flying data, the ACC Flying Hour Program
     Model and unit-specific inputs. Additionally, information such as Programmed Flight Training
     (PFT), staff training, and test requirements, will be identified and included in the initial program
     build. Formal Training Units (FTUs), test units, and other ACC aircraft not under the Ready Air-
     crew Program (RAP) will project their flying hour programs based on historical data, PFT, test
     schedules, etc.
        2.3.1.5.1. (Added-ACC) Upon receipt of the Proposed FHP, units will review and provide
        HQ ACC/A3TB with any projected changes and rationale for the change. Units will respond
        by submitting total requested sorties/hours for their annual flying hour programs to ACC/
        A3TB. Units submitting projected sorties/hours more than one percent in variance from the
        ACC/A3 “Proposed FHP” message will provide documentation staffed through Wing OG.
        Units unable to meet Proposed FHP flying hour projections due to maintenance concerns or
        limitations will submit documentation coordinated through ACC/A4.
        2.3.1.5.2. (Added-ACC) Upon completion and review of all unit responses to the "Proposed
        FHP" message, HQ ACC/A3TB will submit a proposed flying hour program for COMACC
        approval. HQ ACC/A3 will provide each unit with its final tasking for the next fiscal year in
        the "Baseline Allocation" message. Units receiving baseline allocations different from their
        flying hour proposal should submit a flow plan based on the new program to HQ ACC/A3TB
        prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
     2.3.1.6. (Added-ACC) Contingency Planning. Since the flying hours and associated funds pro-
     vided to ACC by Congress through HQ USAF are allocated for aircrew training, maintenance of
     combat capability, test functions, and higher headquarters tasking; contingency operations may
     require additional funding by national command authorities. Because there is some inherent train-
     ing that occurs while participating in contingency operations, the actual funding and programming
     for contingency operations requires resources allocated to support the unit's home station flying
     hour program along with additional flying hours/funds supplemented by the HQ USAF.
        2.3.1.6.1. (Added-ACC) The unit's contribution to the contingency operation will be those
        hours the deployed aircraft/crew ratio would have flown at home station in their normal train-
        ing profiles. HQ ACC/A3TB will reprogram the hours from the home station training account
        and place them into a specific contingency account for the unit to fly. Due to higher ASDs in
        theater, this account will normally have fewer hours than the total hours required, necessitat-
        ing contingency supplemental hours from HQ USAF.
        2.3.1.6.2. (Added-ACC) Deployed units will fly all tasking assigned by the theater com-
        mander. HQ ACC/A3TB is responsible for ensuring the unit obtains the flying hours required
        to fulfill theater requirements and will supplement the account with additional flying hours, by
        authority received from HQ USAF. However, to ensure the optimum use of contingency sup-
        plemental flying hours and dollars, the unit must provide accurate and timely execution data
        from their deployed forces. Units execute the hours in their contingency operation account
        beginning when their aircraft takeoff from home station deploying to the theater and continue
        to use them until their aircraft land back at home station on redeployment. Units are not
        accountable for all the hours that are in their contingency accounts.

     2.3.2. Examples include:
        2.3.2.1. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Sorties (those sorties that lead to basic and combat mis-
        sion skills) and non-RAP sorties (those sorties that build basic pilot skills such as instrument,
        advanced handling, navigation, etc.)
        2.3.2.2. Mission Qualification Training
        2.3.2.3. Special Capability Requirements
        2.3.2.4. Operational Missions
        2.3.2.5. Collateral and other force support sorties/hours (ferry, functional check flight, weather
        ship, control ship, etc.)
        2.3.2.6. Aging rate required for aircrews to achieve required crew qualifications
        2.3.2.7. Number of training events
        2.3.2.8. In-unit requalification training
        2.3.2.9. Syllabus hours associated with undergraduate and graduate flying training
        2.3.2.10. Refly rate, scheduling effectiveness/efficiency
        2.3.2.11. Number training days
        2.3.2.12. Flying Hour Factor (FHF, the average number of flying hours per student per day) x
        refly rate

2.4. Flying hour computations must include an experiencing (aging) calculation. Although the terms are
different for fighter versus multi-place, crewed aircraft, copilots and wingmen must accumulate hours
permitting them to upgrade at a minimal rate to support planned absorption and crew qualification
requirements to maintain a unit’s ability to fulfill its assigned missions. This calculation will ensure that
flying hour programs identify and provide the required hours to upgrade at a prescribed rate and ensure a
standardized requirements computation for all aircraft.
2.4. (ACC) Program changes and reflows during execution year. Program Change requests to unit flying
hour programs will only be submitted when the unit's total flying hour requirement changes for the year.
Program changes should be made from the unit Operations Group Commander or higher and should be
addressed to HQ ACC/A3T. HQ ACC/A3TB will staff the request for approval. Requested changes must
be fully justified. Units are required to submit a memo for flying hour change approval (Attachment 8
(Added)) and a revised program reflow (Attachment 9 (Added)).
NOTE: Changes to a unit's program constitute a new "contract" with the unit. Units requesting a change
to their annual flying hour program will receive a confirmation response once the proposed change is
approved.
     2.4.1. (Added-ACC) Adjustments to flying hour programs affect Operations and Maintenance (O &
     M) funding at the unit. Because unit commanders have the fiduciary responsibility for all activities at
     their unit, all flying hour related O&M dollars are allocated to the unit level. Therefore, a unit requir-
     ing additional flying hours for additional training requirements will require the O&M dollars to sup-
     port the hours. Conversely, if a unit does not intend to fly all their flying hours, the funds to support
     them are not required at that unit. ACC policy is O&M dollars follow hours, and all changes to a unit's
     annual flying hour program will be followed by a corresponding change to the unit's O&M funding. In
AFI11-102_ACCSUP_I 7 JUNE 2007                                                                           11


   cases where actual costs per flying hour exceed funded levels (due to increased spare parts usage,
   etc.), only the difference between the allocation funding and the amount absorbed by the unit for the
   increased costs, if any, will be withdrawn. Under executed hours or funding will not be withdrawn
   until the middle of the fourth quarter or later in order to give units every opportunity to fly the pro-
   gram.
   2.4.2. (Added-ACC) A program reflow of a unit's flying hour program is basically the same as devel-
   oping the yearly program. Additionally, CHRG aircraft should remain constant for the months already
   flown. The remaining hours and sorties are allocated month by month for the remainder of the year.
   Computations are based on unit needs; adjusting sorties, flying hours, ASD, and UTE as required
   ensuring the net total hours already flown plus the additional requirement equals the unit's total flying
   hour "contract". For example, a revision requested in May must show the actual data flown from Oct
   - Apr and re-computed data from May - Sep. This request must be formatted as shown in Attachment
   9 (Added) and received NLT the 10th calendar day of the month to be applicable for that month. The
   main reason for a re-flow will be due to a change in contingency tasking.

2.5. Calculation. See Attachment 5 for examples. Flying hour requirements are based on the number of
aircrew members that need to be trained and their annual flying training requirements. The following
basic formula applies:
2.5. (ACC) ACC/A3TB will determine the number of sorties required to train aircrews to
COMACC-directed readiness levels and maintain aircrew manning and experience levels (AFI 11-2MDS
volume sets and RAP tasking). Total sorties / 12 months / Primary Aircraft Authorized (PAA) = Sortie
UTE Rate (SUTE). Sorties X ASD = Flying Hours.
   2.5.1. For operational flying units: Hours = number aircrews by category x requirements x duration x
   refly
   2.5.2. For pilot production units: Hours = FHF x class load x number of training days. Instructor pilot
   continuation training requirements are determined in the same manner as operational pilots.
   2.5.3. Within this area the individual formulas are listed that calculate the hours necessary to meet
   each individual training requirement. In general, each requirement will be represented by its own for-
   mula that yields flying hours specific to that requirement. Examples of operational training formulas
   include:
       2.5.3.1. Combat Mission Ready hours (separated for experienced and inexperienced pilots)
       2.5.3.2. Basic Mission Qualified hours (separated for experienced and inexperienced pilots)
       2.5.3.3. Navigation Training/Instrument/Advanced Handling Characteristics hours
       2.5.3.4. Hours required to meet additional special missions/capabilities specifically tasked to the
       unit, such as Combat Search and Rescue, AGM-88, AGM-130, etc.
       2.5.3.5. Hours necessary to maintain Instructor Pilot/ Supervisor qualification
       2.5.3.6. Hours necessary to conduct Mission Qualification Training
       2.5.3.7. Hours required to account for scheduling efficiency and refly requirements (these are his-
       torically based)
12                                                                 AFI11-102_ACCSUP_I 7 JUNE 2007


        2.5.3.8. Hours associated with take-off (initial and non-initial), landings, cell formations, air refu-
        eling (receiver and tanker)
        2.5.3.9. Overseas requirements
        2.5.3.10. Aging or upgrade requirements
     2.5.4. Examples for Formal Training formulas include:
        2.5.4.1. For each MDS, calculations producing the number of training days by month and class,
        number of students by month and class,
        2.5.4.2. Lastly, a position summarizing by MDS indicating total student, instructor pilot continu-
        ation training, and collateral flying hours

2.6. Summary. See Attachment 6 for examples. This is a display of the resulting flying hours. MAJ-
COMs have the latitude to format this display to meet their needs but as a minimum it will show flying
hours by MDS.
