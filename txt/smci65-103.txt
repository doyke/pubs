                                             POLICY

1.1. Overview. All known program office requirements and associated costs will be captured
and tracked in a comprehensive database. This database will provide life-cycle information on
each requirement and will provide an archiving capability for historical purposes. Exploitation
of automation technology will ensure efficient management of financial resources committed to
the acquisition, analysis and support of Center assets. The CCaR database is the SMC system of
record for requirements validation. CCaR will be used to document, manage and report all SMC
requirements including duration, cost, period of performance, funding type, funding amount and
financial execution status. It will provide key information for use in activities associated with the
annual budget cycle, to include budget submissions such as the Program Objective Memorandum
(POM) and budget cut drills. CCaR is an Air Force mandated tool that provides information for
SMC decision makers. CCaR users should strive to ensure that the system always contains
current and accurate information regarding funding requirements for all SMC efforts.
1.2. Primary Purpose of CCaR. (1) Document program and financial requirement(s) to be
executed by the Center, and (2) track financial execution of appropriated funds. The CCaR
record will be used as the requirements description document to support the request and
authorization to incur a government liability (i.e., to execute program funds). A thoroughly
documented requirement must be approved within CCaR prior to Request for Proposal
(RFP) release, contract negotiations or commitment of appropriated funds.

                                           Chapter 3

                                    THE CCAR PROCESS

3.1. Requirement Definition. An item or a service requiring an outlay of government funds,
that when validated, developed, and delivered, meets a specific need within the organization’s
mission.
3.2. Requirement Creation. The CCaR process is an automated series of steps which takes a
program requirement from cradle to grave.
The PM determines the need for a new program requirement and assigns an OPR to research and
develop the requirement as a new CCaR record. The OPR should thoroughly document the
requirement being requested for validation and approval. Using Attachment 1 and the CCaR OPR
checklist as a guide, the OPR completes fields contained in the CCaR record and releases into
coordination.

See Attachment 2 – CCaR Process Flow for a general overview of the entire CCaR Process
3.3. Coordination Process. There are multiple coordination cycles within CCaR (Attachment
5) as well as predetermined coordination authorities associated with each cycle (Attachment 3).
   3.3.1. Coordination Authorities. Specific system privileges are assigned to personnel with
   functional responsibility for certain aspects of the acquisition process. Attachment 3 identifies
   specific responsibilities for each authority when coordinating. Coordination approval by
   these authorities represents an electronic signature equivalent to a signature on paper.
Attachment 3 identifies the authorities that must coordinate on each of the cycles. The OPR must
choose the authorities representing the program they are assigned to for each one of the
mandatory fields identified for the selected coordination cycle. For example, the OPR should
select their PM from the list of all the PMs in the program office.
   3.3.2. Responsibilities of the Coordination Authorities. Each Coordination Authority has
   a specific responsibility when reviewing and coordinating on an In-Process record (see
   Attachment 4). These authority responsibilities are generally the same for all of the
   coordination cycles, but there are slight variances between the initial release and the
   remaining revision cycles. When the Coordination Authority receives the e-mail notification
   for coordination action, it also indicates their review responsibilities (See Attachment 4 for
   the General Coordination Process Flow).
   3.3.3. Coordination Disposition. Each Coordination Authority will have the following
   three options:
       3.3.3.1. Approved – coordination authority approves the CCaR record in accordance
       with their assigned responsibilities. By clicking on the Approved button, CCaR
       automatically sends an e-mail to the next authority in the coordination flow (unless there
       is an authority coordinating in parallel in the flow). It should be noted that authorities
       must enter any comments prior to coordination as they will not be able to enter
       coordination comments afterward. The OPR will receive an e-mail indicating that
       comments have been made in the coordination cycle. The OPR has a choice to respond to
 10                                                              SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011


       any comments by clicking on the OPR button in the In-Process copy and typing in the
       comment section.
       3.3.3.2. Disapproved – coordination authority disapproves the requirement or change in
       requirement altogether. The reason for disapproval should be typed in the comment
       section to indicate to the OPR the problem area(s). A disapproved CCaR record may be
       re-submitted for coordination.
       3.3.3.3. Pending – coordination authority requires a specific issue or issues resolved
       before approving the record. Once again, the authority should indicate the issue(s) in the
       comment section. The OPR must respond to the comment in full in order to resolve the
       issue. If the coordination authority is satisfied with the OPR's response, they can change
       their coordination status to Approved. If the coordination authority’s comments require a
       change to the In-Process copy, the OPR must un-release it from coordination and make
       the change(s) in the Working Copy and release for coordination.
3.4. Approval. Once the final authority coordinates, the requirement is officially approved and
considered a valid requirement. The record appears as an Approved copy in the CCaR record and
is assigned a CCaR number.
3.5. Budget Allocation. Once a requirement is approved and assigned a funding status, funds
are allocated to the requirement.
   3.5.1. Approved Budget. Funding that has been approved for the requirement for all fiscal
   years. The approved budget should be equal to the program’s congressional budget approval.
   3.5.2. Authorized Budget. Funding that has been released for the requirement for active
   fiscal years. The authorized budget should be equal to the funds that have been received, and
   which have been loaded into the Air Force accounting systems.
3.6. Forecasting. A forecast is a projection of program activity over future periods and events.
Event-driven commitments, obligations, and expenditure forecasts are required. There are three
different types of plans in CCaR:
   3.6.1. Suggested Plan. The Project Officer (OPR) establishes the Suggested Forecast and it
   is approved by the Program Manager. This is the commitment, obligation, or expenditure
   plan intended to be executed according to the approved programmatic schedule. The fiscal
   year plan for each requirement must then be coordinated reviewed and approved, which
   begins the planning for the Business Baseline Review. The suggested plan should be
   updated on a monthly basis to capture the true Work Plan for that particular requirement.
   This also lets the Budget Analyst know that the Current plan needs to be updated (see 3.6.3).
   3.6.2. Baseline Plan. Used by the Budget Team in concert with the Project Officer at the
   beginning of the fiscal year to establish a target plan and must be approved by the Program
   Manager. The Baseline Plan is based on the Approved Budget. This plan is normally locked
   and is not changed throughout the fiscal year. Many organizations compare their baselines
   and current forecasts throughout the year. Baseline will be locked by an account holder with
   Supervisor privileges after PEO approval.
   3.6.3. Current Plan. Used by the Budget Team in concert with the Project Officer to track
   the most up-to-date plan and must be approved by the Program Manager. The Current Plan is
SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011                                                                     11


   based on the Approved Budget. This plan is fluid and will normally change throughout the
   life of the effort. It is normally updated on a monthly basis.
3.7. Funding Document Process. The Funding Document Request Form is used by the CCaR
OPR to create funding documents within the CCaR record. The OPR can specify the type of
document, content of the document and any specific POCs associated with the document. The
form can be created from the CCaR record and may be coordinated using a CCaR internal
coordination cycle or be manually approved. Upon final approval of the document, the Budget
Analyst may generate a funding document in one or more CCaR records using one or more fiscal
years and budgets to fund the effort and submits to the Automated Business Services System
(ABSS) for certification (See Sections 3.8.2 - 3.8.3). The system also allows the program office
to establish rules for the creation of funding documents as described below.
3.8. Business Rules. Business rules are the values of each budget to prevent over-execution of
funding. For any CCaR requirement, documents created to fund a specific fiscal year cannot
exceed the approved budget amount. If the budget analyst attempts to create a document that
makes the total commitment greater than the Approved budget amount, the system will indicate
the error and not allow the change. Therefore, if an OPR requests funding exceeding the
approved budget amount, the Budget Analyst will be unable to create a document for that
amount. It is imperative the OPR requests additional funding through the coordination cycle in
order to have the increased funds approved for the requirement.
   3.8.1. Document Creation. The Budget Analyst can create any of the follow funding
   documents/forms in CCaR:

Table 3.1. Documents/Forms Created in CCaR.


AF Form 185 - Project Order
AF Form 4009 – Government Purchase Card - Fund Cite Authorization
AF Form 406 – Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Document (MORD)
AF Form 616 - Fund Cite Authorization (FCA)
AF Form 9 - Request for Purchase
AF Form 9L- Letter of Change
AFMC Form 36 - Purchase Request (PR)
AFMC Form 277 - Reimbursable Order (e.g. Aerospace)
DD Form 448 - Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)
DD Form 448-2 - MIPR Acceptance



   3.8.2. Document Submission/Certification. In order to have a commitment document
   certified for a requirement, the Budget Analyst electronically submits the form(s) to the
   Accounting and Finance System via ABSS. Only CCaR users that have ABSS accounts will
   be able to release funding documents for certification via CCaR. If the document is fully
   approved through the ABSS coordination cycle, CCaR will identify the document as
   CERTIFIED-ABSS and will calculate the amount as an official financial commitment for its
   corresponding appropriation.
 12                                                                 SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011


3.9. Reconciliation. It is a vital part of CCaR to ensure transactions between CCaR and DFAS
are balanced. Otherwise, the CCaR records will show either more money or less money was
spent than authorized. Once the system has identified a problem it is up to the Budget Analyst to
perform an analysis and determine the cause and a course of corrective action. Reconciliation is
accomplished through the Reconciliation Module and/or Contracts Module (See Chapters 4 and
5).
3.10. Reports. CCaR has several reports that are accessible to users and can be used for data
collection, tracking, and analysis. Reports are based on several categories including multiple
fiscal year reports, financial execution reports, funding document related reports and
coordination reports. Most reports may be sorted and filtered and contain options for printing
and exporting. Although many reports may contain similar data, their formats may differ. This
may be necessary to offer a targeted emphasis intended for the many specific audiences that may
be involved in managing and executing the requirement. Reports in CCaR are grouped into one
of the following categories:
   3.10.1. Budget, Execution, Document, Coordination and Miscellaneous Report. Please
   see Attachment 6
3.11. Fund Status. Fund status is displayed in the Funding Profile Report, as well as, in some
of the other reports generated by CCaR. CCaR assigns one of the follow three colored statuses:
   3.11.1. Blue Fund Status (Blue Square). Indicates funding has been dedicated to that
   requirement because:
       3.11.1.1. The total budget for the requirement has been committed by program control or
       3.11.1.2. The requirement must be funded because of a contractual liability (i.e. award
       fee, SETA support, etc.)
Program Control has the ability to dedicate funds to a requirement. The system allows them to
dedicate funding through a specific fiscal year; i.e. requirements past the current fiscal year
would not be dedicated until the program office receives the funds for those fiscal years. When a
requirement has this status, the system will not automatically reallocate funds to a higher priority
request, unless it is also dedicated by an authorized individual.
   3.11.2. Green Fund Status (Green Arrow). Indicates funds are currently available in all
   years, therefore, it is a funded requirement. However, the status may change to red if one of
   the follow situations occurs:
       3.11.2.1. Another requirement is approved with a higher priority or
       3.11.2.2. The budget authority for a given year is adjusted downward
   3.11.3. Red Fund Status (Red Arrow). Indicates funding is not available in one or more
   years; therefore, it is an unfunded requirement. The system will identify which fiscal years
   do not have available funds (highlighted in red on the Funding Profile Report). The status
   may change to green if one of the follow situations occurs:
       3.11.3.1. Another requirement is reprioritized with a lower priority or
       3.11.3.2. The budget authority for its appropriated funding is adjusted upward
SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011                                                                        13


3.12. Business Charts. CCaR will be used to generate Business Charts for Wing or Group
reviews as well as the Spring Program Review/Investment Budget Review/Program Management
Reviews. These are all important parts of the business management review process.
3.13. Requirement Updates/Contract Actions. Changes during a project’s life cycle (e.g.
quantity) will prompt updates to the funding estimate and profile. Normally, the requirement
remains constant but the estimate requires revision based on various factors. Attachment 4
diagrams the general process flows for updating a CCaR due to requirement changes.
3.14. Deletion. The OPR can request a CCaR be deleted if the record meets the following
criteria:
   3.14.1. The record must not contain any execution data.
   3.14.2. The record must not contain any forecasts.
   3.14.3. The record must not contain any Approved Funding. Once a CCaR record is deleted,
   it cannot be recovered.
3.15. Archival. The OPR can request archival of a CCaR record under their authority. Once a
CCaR record is archived, the OPR support responsibilities end. A record can be archived if the
following are true:
   3.15.1. The period of performance and execution of all funding in each fiscal year budgeted
   is complete.
   3.15.2. The record is not In-Process for a coordination cycle. In-Process copy must be
   unreleased before archiving the record.
   3.15.3. The requirement has been assigned a Dedicated funding status for all fiscal years.

                                        CONTRACTS

4.1. Purpose. The Contract Module allows the PCO and the Budget Analyst to enter and keep
track of the large contracts relating to their programs. The module creates an electronic version
of the contract and allows the PCO and the Budget Analyst to enter CLIN, ACRN, overall
contract value, effective dates, obligations and expenditure vouchers. All active prime contracts
should be in the Contract Module. This module is also intended to support award fee/incentive
fee calculations and contract closeout.
4.2. Features. The Contract Module creates reports based on ACRN, CLIN, obligation and
expenditure totals. The contract data is entered by indicating the Basic, each subsequent
modification (P00000). To ensure accuracy of the data in the existing module, each modification
increasing the value of a particular CLIN or ACRN carries the value of that CLIN or ACRN to
date. This information should be used to validate all data has been entered into the contracts
module to date and should correspond with the existing information in the contract module.
Funding documents and the original requirement (CCaR) can be linked to the contract
obligations and expenditures providing a complete execution picture.
4.3. Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs). All funding requirements,
purchased under the Economy Act, and sent outside the DoD (NASA, NOAA, JPL, etc.) will
require a Determination and Findings (D&F) document. This document must be approved at the
SES/Flag Officer level. PCO will assist project officer in preparing D&F for all Economy Act
MIPR requirements. No funding document can be released prior to this document being
prepared and approved at the SES/Flag Officer level.

                                      RECONCILIATION

5.1. Purpose. The Reconciliation Module displays financial transactions through the
accounting cycle to include commitments, obligations and expenditures. The display shows both
CCaR and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) transactions with amounts and
status. The objective of the module is to provide a comparative view of the transaction records
between CCaR and DFAS accounting systems.
5.2. Features. The analyst has the ability to view CCaR and DFAS documents in the
Reconciliation Module. In the case of unlinked documents, the analyst has the ability to
manually create this link. If the documents are incorrect or do not belong to the organization, the
analyst can use the information in the module to contact DFAS and start the proper corrective
process.
5.3. Goal. The goal of Reconciliation is to ensure integrity within all financial systems.

      SYSTEM METRICS AND REPORTING TOOL (SMART)/ CCAR INTERFACE

6.1. Purpose. All programs are required to use the automated interface between CCaR and
SMART to populate Monthly Acquisition Review (MAR) financial data. Contact your CCaR
Administrator to map your applicable programs to SMART. In order to ensure the highest
level of accuracy of data is sent to SMART, Reconciliation must be done prior to
transmitting CCaR data. It is also imperative that your programs’ Baseline forecasts are in
CCaR and you have verified that your Budget Authority Editor and Requirements are
correct.
6.2. Features. The interface is managed in CCaR under the Program Tool. The analyst has the
ability to select which budgets and CCaRs are transmitted to SMART. Before data is sent, the
analyst has the opportunity to preview how the information would appear in the MAR.
Transmission can be sent at anytime by the analyst or scheduled in advance to be sent
automatically by CCaR at the end of the month.
6.3. Goal. The goal of the interface is to reduce manual entry and increase accuracy of program
data.
6.4. Annual Review. This OI will be reviewed annually for updates.

                                          Attachment 1
          GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Terms.
CCaR Database— The CCaR database is a government owned system which uses an Oracle
relational database and a user interface developed in PowerBuilder. CCaR implements logic
rules and sequential coordination activities to facilitate the development, coordination, tracking,
and revision of all organization requirements and their associated financial execution.
CCaR Record— A CCaR record is a requirements package consisting of all pertinent
information, financial and otherwise, associated with that requirement. See Attachment 1 for
CCaR Record Information Guide. CCaR records are created for items that need to be considered
in the budget decision process and to document program and financial requirement(s) to be
executed by the organization. An Officer of Primary Responsibility (OPR) is assigned for each
CCaR record, and is responsible for creating, maintaining, and overseeing execution of their
CCaR record from cradle to grave. CCaR records are tracked individually by the system, and
when combined, form the total requirements for an organization. The CCaR record should
clearly identify an action or requirement which will require program or user funds, fiscal year(s),
funding appropriation(s) and all information required in order to comprehensively document the
program requirement and obtain coordination approval.
CCaR Record Copy— The CCaR Record Copy depends upon where in the CCaR Process the
OPR is and what activities they are doing in order to define the appropriate version of a CCaR
record.
There are three main types of CCaR Copies:

Working
In—Process
Approved
Working Copy— Used by the OPR to maintain the most current and accurate information
about the CCaR record. This is the OPR's Working copy, and its data is not yet rewritable in
reports and tools, and cannot be viewed by any other user unless the OPR adds an additional user
as a Backup-OPR or until the OPR releases the record for coordination.
In—Process Copy - This copy contains information currently in a coordination cycle for
approval. The OPR will release the Working copy for coordination, at which time the
information from the Working copy will be copied to the In-Process copy. When a CCaR record
is In-Process, this selection will be available from the CCaR copy drop-down list. Once the In-
Process copy is approved, it overwrites the previous approved copy. Information on this tab is
not editable, with the exception of the Coordination section. In order to make changes while a
record is In-Process, the OPR must do the following:
Remove the record from In—Process status by clicking on the Unrelease button in the In-
Process copy.
SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011                                                                   19


The In—Process version is returned to Working. The OPR can now make the corrections to the
Working copy.
Once all the corrections are made, re—release into coordination.
Approved Copy—           An Approved copy contains the most current approved CCaR
information. It is not editable and may be viewed by all system users with appropriate
privileges. If the record has not been approved, there will be no Approved copy in the CCaR
drop-down list. The Approved copy of a CCaR record is recognized by the system as a valid
budget requirement and is used for budgeting justification, planning, execution and reporting.
Historical copies of Approved CCaR copies are available from the CCaR copy drop-down list
and are sorted in ascending order by date.

                          CCAR RECORD INFORMATION GUIDE

This section is designed as guidance to the CCaR OPR to prepare a CCaR record. A CCaR
record is constructed to identify an action or requirement which will require program or user
funds. The CCaR record should identify fiscal year(s), funding appropriation(s) and all
information required to obtain coordination and subsequent approval.

Prior to inputting the requirement information into CCaR, it is highly recommended that
the OPRs do their research to ensure correct and accurate information by consulting with
different experts (i.e. Budget Analysts, Cost Estimators, etc)

I. CCaR Title

Project name identifier for CCaR record. If your record is one of a series of records, so indicate
in the title.

II. CCaR Period of Performance

Time frame over which work is to be performed (Start/Stop dates). Enter the period of
performance (when the requirement will incur financial liabilities) for the requirement.

III. CCaR General Information (Custom Fields)
General information about the requirement. The CCaR system offers users 20 custom fields to
track organizational specific information. In some cases, the organization may not use all 20
fields, and they will not all appear on the CCaR window. Those that do appear may or may not
be mandatory, depending on the business practices established by your organization; mandatory
fields will be displayed in red. If you wish to add a category, contact your CCaR Administrator.
These custom fields ARE REPORTABLE information. A report can be generated off the
customized information (ex. The CCaR records that fall under a certain contract).
IV. Description
Description. Enter the description of the requirement. There will be two parts to the description,
the General Description and the Current FY/Updates.

Top part, Updates/Effort by FY should describe:

   The current year effort being performed and what funding is required.

   Any update to (i.e. requirements, contract modification)

The Updates/Effort by FY and the General Description should be divided by a line.

The General Description is a detailed review of the specific activities the entire CCaR effort will
encompass. The description, which is required, should be as comprehensive as possible to
include:
SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011                                                                            21



   Narrative description outlining the project; must distinguish what type of funding to use to
   complete the effort.

   Type of work to be performed and by whom

   Functional requirement and technical solution

   Technical parameters (i.e. weight, volume, power, etc.)

   Alternatives considered

   Acquisition plan/strategy (if applicable)

   Any other efforts affected by this particular requirement

V. Requirement Source
Enter the requirement source. The requirement source defines where this requirement originated.
It may be from an appropriated budget or it could be from an outside source, an Incoming
Document, or the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) or a Program Management
Directive (PMD), Funding Document, or other sources. Source documents (if available) should
be attached to the CCaR record.


VI. Impact Statement
Enter the programmatic and operational impact if the requirement is not funded. The Impact
Statement is an outline of the adverse impact to the organization and/or system end-users if the
CCaR requirement is NOT performed.
The Impact Statement should be:

Strong and realistic

Specific and defend the requirement

This information can be used by Senior Managers to determine the impacts of projected budget
cuts and defend against them.




Each impact statement should fall within one of the follow categories:
   1) Operational Impact – Capability won't be provided or there will be a schedule slip in
      providing a capability. Try to talk in terms of capabilities to the warfighter/user. If you
 22                                                                SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011


       can, be specific about how much of a schedule slip there will be and what the operational
       impact of the slip will be.

       Example 1: If the small tactical terminal (STT) antennas are not combined into one unit,
       the STT will exceed the weight limit by 30%.

       Example 2: If the Solid State Recorders (SSRs) are not incorporated onto the spacecraft,
       the effort to add the Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor will not be feasible.

       Example 3: If the near real-time download capability is not added to the spacecraft, the
       war fighter may have to wait up to four hours to refresh their weather forecasts

   2) Non-compliance with Policy: Will not be consistent with direction from senior
      Department of Defense (DoD) leadership or Congress.

       Be specific about whose policy will be violated.

       If possible, state what the operational impact will be for failing to comply.

   3) Safety Issue – capability will be unsafe; state when issue must be completed

   4) Business Case – Will result in greater cost to the government or government will fail to
      meet its contractual obligations.

VII. Basis of Estimate
The basis of estimate contains two sections:

Written Section

A detailed record of the methodology, procedures and data resulting in the development or
update of a requirement estimate. The required level of detail in each cost estimate is flexible and
will vary depending on the purpose of the estimate. However, at a minimum, the estimate section
of a record shall contain the follow types of information:

1) Team Composition. Identify all estimating team members (if applicable), their organization,
and their telephone number. If the estimate was developed by an outside source (example:
Aerospace) identify the name of that person(s) and the date the estimate was completed.

2) Ground Rules & Assumptions. List all technical and programmatic conditions, estimating
ground rules, constraints, and assumptions used in developing the estimate.

3) Methodology. Provide a brief overview of the primary methodology used to develop the
estimate. Examples of estimates developed internally are Analogy, Engineering, or Parametric
Model. Estimates can also be derived from Contractor submitted Rough Orders of Magnitude
SMCI65-103 28 APRIL 2011                                                                        23


(ROM) or proposals. Relative confidence in the estimate should be included. It should be
indicated if the effort has been negotiated.

4) Estimate Basis. Sufficient information must be given in this section to allow replication of the
estimate by a cost analyst unfamiliar with the program. If there are multiple appropriations
funding the effort, the estimate should be broken out by the respective appropriations. An excel
spreadsheet and/or other documentation can be attached to show the estimate calculations broken
down by appropriation and the follow categories, as applicable:

       Labor Hours and Rates

       Material and subcontract costs

       Profit or Fee (including Award Fee if applicable)

       Fiscal Year phasing

Whenever an estimate changes, the OPR should document the change in dollar amount
and precise reasons for the cost changes (e.g., submittal of contractor proposal, change in
technical requirement, etc.)

Spreadsheet

CCaR allows you to directly imbed an Excel spreadsheet into the basis of estimate section by

                                           REPORTS

The below Reports are the some of the most commonly used. However, organizations may use
the many reports that are in the system.

Funding Profile - The Funding Profile is the cornerstone of the CCaR System. It rolls up all
approved CCaR financial information and displays it as the official budget. The report displays
10 years of financial information for the requirements and associated funding. It provides three
views: unfunded, funded and total requirements.

Expert Report - Designed to add flexibility to the reporting capability in CCaR.
The expert report also allows users to take advantage of the hierarchical capability. This report
allows the user to view information by any of the 20 custom categories established for their
database. The Expert Report is actually multiple reports in one, as many data sorts are available
for each of the categories. This report allows isolation of specific information about a CCaR or a
group of CCaR records.

Flex Report - Allows the user to create tailor-able views. The user establishes custom
folders/groups when creating the report. Once the custom folders/groups are complete, the user
can see various reports tailored to those views.

Document Report - The Document Report allows users to view all commitment, obligation or
expenditure documents for a particular budget and fiscal year.

Plan Summary Report - Allows the user to view selected budgets and fiscal years, the monthly
plans for commitment, obligations and expenditures. The monthly plans are broken down by
CCaR, which provides a individual and monthly plan total

Execution Reports – Allows the user to build stoplight charts, obligations and expenditure
timelines as well as associated snake charts.
