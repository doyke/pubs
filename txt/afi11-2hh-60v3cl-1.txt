This checklist establishes procedures for the operation of HH-
60 aircraft employed by the Air Force Combat Command
(ACC) and gained units to accomplish their worldwide
missions. HH-60 crewmembers must carry extracted contents
of this AFI (excluding Attachment 1) for all flights.This
checklist complements AFI 11-2HH-60V3, HH-60 Operations
Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper then
trimmed to a unique size (4 ½” x 7”) that will fit standard HH-60
aircrew checklist binders. Units may request media from the OPR.
Printed copies are limited to aircrew for use in in-flight and
training purposes only. The flight lead/aircraft commander will
ensure all aircrew/team members receive the appropriate briefing
prior to the applicable mission. Brief only applicable items.

         # 406TI Medevac IIA TI Titanium break down.

NOTE • A 5000 pound locking carabineer will be used to
       attach the stokes sling assembly to the hoist hook.
     • If any of the following conditions are noted, repair
       or replace prior to placing in service.

1. Inspect Stokes Litter for general condition.
2. Inspect all metal for cracks, indents, corrosion and security of
   attachment.
3. Inspect all welds for cracks and security of attachment.
4. Inspect snow skids for general condition (if applicable).
5. Inspect suspension bed webbing for cuts, tears, stains, fraying and
   security of attachment.
6. Inspect quick release fittings for ease of operation, sharp edges and
   corrosion.
7. Inspect all straps for cuts, tears, stains, fraying and security of
   attachment.
8. Inspect Lift Rings for deformity or cracks.
9. Inspect all stitching for fraying and security of attachment.
10. Inspect all webbing for cuts, tears, fraying and grease contamination.
11. Inspect carabineers for proper gate alignment, ease of operation,
    cracks and corrosion.
12. Inspect carabineer gate pin hinge for deformity and security of
    attachment.
13. Inspect for reflective tape on rescue litter and carabineers.
    a. Red reflective tape (2 places, 1-1/2 x 1/2-inch) at upper attachment
    points (As required).
    b. White reflective tape (2 places, 1-1/2 x 1/2-inch NIIN 01-078-8660)
    at lower attachment points (As required).
14. Inspect entire Flotation Assembly for general condition, cleanliness,
    cuts, tears, fraying and for presence of oil, fuel, grease or chemical
    contamination.
15. Inspect lift cable sets for one crimp, identified by 1/2-inch wide
    compression on swagging sleeves and defects such as kinks, broken
    wire strands, corrosion.
                                                                        18
            RANDON TECH ROPE LADDER
         (HH-60 ELD800PD SERIES AND TCL600)

                          WARNING
--If any nicks or excessive fraying to the point of
broken strands are found, do not use the rope ladder for live
operations, serious injury or death may result. See Figures 5-
7 and 5-8 in T.O. 00-25-245.

--The following indicate obsolete equipment and should not
be used for live operations; serious in-jury or death may
result:
• Corrosion on the rivet-washer connection points (should be
stainless-stainless).
• Rope ladder fabric with shinny appearance (similar to a
vehicle seat belt).
• Detacher housings without beveled or rounded edges

                          CAUTION
--When preparing the rope ladder for night operations do
not use duct tape on the nylon fabric. Duct tape residue
hinders the post flight fabric cleansing, and hides potential
problem areas (e.g. use rubber bands, plastic zip ties).

--During inspection, dragging the rope ladder on concrete
should be kept to a minimum to reduce abrasion and
maintain normal service life.

1. Ensure detacher serial numbers match rope ladder.
2. Inspect detacher device fasteners for loosening and failure.
3. Inspect detacher pip pin for proper spring/operation.
4. Inspect carabineers for corrosion and proper operation.
5. Inspect wheeled rungs and fasteners for loosening and
failure.
6. Inspect main ladder straps for dry-rot, holes, nicks and
   excessive fraying.

                                                                19

                             NOTE
• Ensure both sides of the rope ladder are visually inspected.
• Detachers are "powder-coated", there is no need to oil
  parts.
• Small amounts of hydraulic fluid are allowed on the fabric.
• Ensure the ladder is cleaned after use.
7. Inspect ladder rungs for damaged tubes or grip tape.
8. Inspect rung rivet-washer points for corrosion, cracks or
   stretched fabric.
9. Ensure no twists exist with main ladder straps.
10. Fold or roll the ladder into the stowed position on the
cabin floor.
11. Refer to T.O. 00-25-245 for post flight requirements.
                      FRIES/FAST ROPES
1. Checks the woven loop on the mount end for excessive
wear or chemical contamination.
2. Checks the rope along its entire length for fraying, cuts,
and chemical contamination. Inspect for any cut, chafe, or
nicks that affect integrity of the rope.
3. Do not use a rope that is severely frayed. (Light fraying on
the rope from normal use does not weaken the rope.)
4. Do not use a rope when any single strand is cut halfway
through or has two or more cuts that penetrate one-third or
more through any strand's thickness within 1 foot of the
running length of the FRIES.
5. Inspects the rope for contamination of acid, alkaline
   compounds, saltwater, fire extinguisher solutions, or
petroleum-based solvents. Changes in color caused by
chemicals are usually blotchy and have an unusual odor.
Although used ropes gradually change color, such changes
do not indicate a decrease in strength unless the change is
due to contact with strong chemicals. Changes occurring
because of use are usually uniform throughout the length of
the rope.
6. Inspects the extraction loops to the same standard as the
main rope. Ensures the woven attachment loops are secure.
7. Make necessary Inspection entries on appropriate form.
