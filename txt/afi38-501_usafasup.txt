   Force level.
       1.1.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Air Force Personnel Center, Manpower Agency (AFPC/MA).
       AFPC/MA will be involved in surveys that impact multiple bases. Installation and unit
       commanders will oversee their own Survey Control Program addressing personnel solely

       satisfying USAF Academy cadet academic requirements specific to surveying other
       cadets/faculty/staff for a cadet course requirement that executes research for a grade.
       After the USAFA Survey Control Program reviews the request, these particular surveys
       will normally be granted an exemption from the local USAFA Survey Control Program
       requirements, as long as the subject matter is not a politically charged, nationally
       sensitive, or high-profile topic.
   1.1.3. Issues Survey Control Number (SCN) for approved survey requests submitted by Air
   Force organizations, contracted individuals, or organizations.
   1.1.3. (USAFA) The USAFA Survey Program has oversight of all surveys (to include polls,
   questionnaires, interviews, customer service polls, focus groups, or any other means of
   collecting attitude, opinion, preference or intention data and faculty research surveys)
   conducted on USAFA or involving USAFA personnel except:
       1.1.3.1. (Added-USAFA) Surveys administered solely within a classroom or multiple
       sections of a common course by instructors or cadets within the classrooms for the
       purpose of demonstrating course-related concepts or course related opinions to enhance
       academic learning. Cadets and instructors should not administer course-developed
       surveys outside of the classroom without appropriate survey control approval.
       1.1.3.2. (Added-USAFA) Post experimental questionnaires that provide feedback about
       an experimental experience rather than being used as a data collection instrument related
       to the experimental hypothesis.
       1.1.3.3. (Added-USAFA) Customer satisfaction surveys for products or service or
       program if the sole purpose is to ask about the product or service or program.

       1.1.3.4. (Added-USAFA) Medical, nutritional, diagnostic or counseling support
       assessment administered on an individual basis by USAFA Medical personnel that does
       not ask for attitudes, opinions or intentions.
       1.1.3.5. (Added-USAFA) Diagnostic instruments administered and reported by USAFA
       agencies only on an individual basis for the purposes of education or careers assistance,
       or financial management awareness.
    1.1.4. (Added-USAFA) Surveys directed and administered by higher headquarters, such as
    Department of Defense (DoD), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Defense
    Manpower Data Center (DMDC) or Headquarters Air Force (HAF), while not overseen by
    the USAFA Survey Program, should be coordinated through the USAFA Survey Program
    and the USAFA OPR for the topic addressed.

                                            Chapter 3

                                  SURVEY DEVELOPMENT

3.1. Guidelines. The following guidelines are provided to assist survey requestors in
developing survey projects.
3.2. Pre-Development.
   3.2.1. Survey requestors should discuss survey plans with the AF Survey Office before
   developing a survey to avoid expenditure of monies and duplication of survey projects and to
   coordinate timelines/ schedules between survey efforts.
   3.2.2. All survey collection tools administered via the commercial internet (.net, .com, etc)
   must be in accordance with AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use, Section 3.7.4.1.
   To maintain the security, integrity, and accountability of Air Force information on the Web,
   most public web sites are managed through the Air Force Public Information Management
   System and private Air Force Web sites through the Air Force portal. Any Air Force Web
   site hosted on a commercial server (outside the .mil community) requires SAF/XC approval.
3.3. Survey Utility. To ensure effective survey research, surveys should:
   3.3.1. Contribute significantly to the study of relevant Air Force policy or program issues.
   3.3.2. Not merely gather information to meet requirements for award of an academic degree
   or serve as a springboard for future research.
   3.3.3. Result in expected benefits to the Air Force clearly outweighing the potential costs
   (e.g., negative publicity, damage to morale or readiness, time burden on respondents).
   3.3.4. Contain questions and issues of an appropriate length to avoid survey fatigue. In
   addition, certain populations (e.g., deployed members) tend to be surveyed more; therefore,
   surveys of those populations may be disapproved for that reason.
3.4. Respondent Anonymity and Confidentiality. Use administrative procedures that protect
participant’s responses and identity IAW AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program.
3.5. Target Population. Identify demographics of the targeted population and calculate the
appropriate sample size from which to capture survey responses (i.e., military, civilian, skill sets,
rank, grade, etc.)
   3.5.1. Determine if survey-sampling techniques can be used to provide valid and reliable
   information at greatly reduced costs and time burdens on Air Force personnel. Surveys that
   include all members of a target population are discouraged.
       3.5.1.1. Select an appropriate sample size to ensure survey results represent the attitudes
       and opinions of the target population.
       3.5.1.2. Sample the minimum number of respondents necessary to reasonably achieve a
       satisfactory confidence interval.
   3.5.2. Exclude participation of contract employees, which is not authorized for government-
   sponsored surveys.

   3.5.3. Notify the Civilian Personnel Office at each participating Civilian Personnel Element,
   Manpower & Personnel Flight, for labor union notification prior to releasing an approved
   survey to civilian employees. For surveys of civilians at more than one base, HQ
   AFPC/DPIECC, Air Force Program Management and Evaluation, must be notified.
3.6. Survey Questions.
   3.6.1. Should not be of a sensitive nature, objectionable, or in bad taste.
   3.6.2. Should not require a lot of time and effort to respond.
   3.6.3. Should be grammatically correct and easily understood by the respondents.
   3.6.4. Do not include survey questions not intended for public release. Treat each survey
   question as though results will be released to the public. Consider the potential impact of
   public release on the following groups: Active duty personnel and their families; Air
   National Guard and Air Force Reserve members; Civilian employees; Service academy
   members; Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets and auxiliary; Retired military
   personnel and their families; Community organizations (including civic, trade, industrial,
   veterans, youth, ethnic, women, religious, environmental, and educational groups); The
   Congress; Local, state, and Federal Government officials; Professional organizations (e.g.,
   partnerships, associations, corporations, business trusts, legal representatives, organized
   groups of individuals); and Civic leaders.
3.7. Questionnaire Package, Format, and Structure.
   3.7.1. Cover letter or instructions should contain a statement that the survey is anonymous
   and that individual responses will be kept confidential, but summarized responses may be
   released to the public.
   3.7.2. If copyrighted scales, subscales, or questions are used, the requester must have
   permission from the author(s) (if required) and cite the author(s) in any subsequent report or
   summary. Questions concerning copyright issues can be directed to AFLOA/JACQ, Rosslyn,
   Virginia.
   3.7.3. Each topic area should be covered adequately.
   3.7.4. Questions should be in a logical sequence.
   3.7.5. Questionnaire should present a neat, professional appearance.
   3.7.6. Obtain approval and endorsement on all survey requests from HQ USAF functional
   authority (minimum three-letter office). This ensures effective research is conducted across
   the Air Force while reducing duplication of similar efforts. Survey requests will not be
   approved without this endorsement.
3.8. Response Scales
   3.8.1. When using response scales, they must be balanced (e.g., when positive and negative
   responses are called for, there should be equal numbers of responses on both sides of the
   neutral point, whether the neutral point is explicit or implied).
   3.8.2. Response scales should be complete, covering the full range of possible answers. An
   "I don’t know," "None of the above," "N/A," or "Neither/Nor" response may be necessary.
AFI38-501_USAFASUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            11


   3.8.3. Responses should be mutually exclusive and when covering a continuous variable
   such as time, weight, etc., they should be all-inclusive as well.
