This manual implements AFPD 34-2, Managing Nonappropriated Funds, by assigning responsibilities
and explaining procedures for financial management and operations for all nonappropriated funds (NAF),
under the jurisdiction of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. This manual prescribes procedures to use in
the Cash Management and Investment Program (CMIP), and related systems for which reporting is inte-
grated. This manual also applies to all Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force
Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) personnel when they are on federal active duty. Excluded are
funds managed by the Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, chaplain funds, and
patrons' and prisoners' trust funds. It does not apply to private organizations' funds or funds established
for employees of government contractors. While the financial policies and procedures do not apply to pri-
vate organizations, they may use them as guidelines.
Except as provided in AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds, waivers to this manual have no effect
without approval and control numbers assigned by Headquarters Air Force Services Agency, Directorate
of Financial Management and Comptroller (HQ AFSVA/SVF), 10100 Reunion Place Suite 400, San
Antonio TX 78216-4138. All waivers in effect before the date of this manual are void and must be reac-
complished.
The reporting requirements in this manual (except for those cited in paragraphs 7.9. and 13.1.) are exempt
from licensing in accordance with AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports Management
Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2003-01. This interim change, (IC) 03-01, provides guid-
ance for the Procedures for Cash Management and Investment Program on Air Force Installations. Para-
graph 5.3., the sentence that reads, “Two authorized signatories must sign all checks of $50,000 or more.
The concentration bank and the overseas MBFs will return checks of $50,000 or more which do not bear
two signatories to the vendor unpaid,” is deleted. Paragraph 11.4. is changed to read “Verification of Out-
2                                                                                      AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003


standing Check Reports. The NAF AO reviews the outstanding check reports monthly and notifies HQ
AFSVA/SVFB of any error in a check number. HQ AFSVA/SVFB then takes corrective action. Checks of
less than $150 can be voided after 120 days if all attempts to contact the payee have been unsuccessful.
Checks of $150 or more must remain outstanding for 1 year. It is not necessary to place a stop payment on
the checks written-off unless a replacement check is to be issued. However, if the check has been depos-
ited or cashed before the cash void request has been made, the base will be charged and the base needs to
do a journal voucher to reverse the entry since the funds are due the payee.”

                                               Chapter 1

    CASH MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Applicability. This manual prescribes relationships of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities
(NAFI) in the CMIP with the Air Force Financial Management Fund (AFFMF) and with banks associated
with the CMIP.

1.2. CMIP System Overview:
   1.2.1. Background. The CMIP provides for consolidation of cash resources among Air Force
   NAFIs. HQ AFSVA/SVFB is the central manager of the program for the AFFMF.The AFFMF is the
   custodial fund for Air Force NAF and serves as the central processor for all participating NAFIs. The
   AFFMF presently uses a principal concentration bank, and maintains accounts in financial institutions
   on or near Air Force bases throughout the world. The CMIP system uses inter-bank transfers to
   accomplish cash consolidation so that AFFMF cash managers can provide a more efficient use of
   funds belonging to the participating NAFIs. HQ AFSVA/SVFB invests excess funds in securities
   authorized by Department of Defense (DoD) until such time as needed for operational or capital
   expenditures. The base computer system automatically generates the transactions reported to CMIP.
   The formats given for each transaction type are only used when manual input is necessary to report.
   See instructions for manual input in paragraph 13.4.
   1.2.2. Cash and Savings. A professional staff centrally manages the program to ensure that opti-
   mum rates of return are received on a national basis, that federal and DoD guidelines are followed,
   and that there are proper safeguards and internal controls for negotiable instruments. Such invest-
   ments are fully insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit
   Union Administration (NCUA). The FDIC has two insuring agencies--Bank Insurance Fund (BIF)
   for commercial banks and Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) for savings and loan associa-
   tions. Investments may only be made by HQ AFSVA/SVFB. Other offices administering NAFs will
   not engage in any investment activity.
   1.2.3. Deposits. NAFIs perform their business functions, prepare deposits, and take the deposits to
   the central cashier for consolidation. The central cashier makes the consolidated deposit in the field
   bank, and the deposit slip is returned to the NAF Accounting Office (NAF AO). At bases without a
   central cashier, deposits are made by the activities. The NAF AO reports daily deposits (and related
   transactions) to the Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Advisory Board (AFMWRAB) via the
   Automated Digital Network (AUTODIN) transmission system within the United States Air Force
   (USAF) Communications System or via the Defense Data Network (DDN). The CMIP system records
   deposits (and related transactions) in a cash subsidiary file.Individual deposits are identified by base,
   NAFI, and document number in this subsidiary file. Each day the CMIP system sends a message to
   the principal concentration bank which generates the inter-bank transfers transferring monies depos-
   ited in the field banks to the concentration bank. Bases located outside the Continental United States
   (CONUS) make deposits to their designated banks, normally the Military Banking Facility (MBF), in
   foreign currency or US dollars. HQ AFSVA/SVFB routinely wire transfers funds from these desig-
   nated banks to the principal concentration bank. HQ AFSVA/SVFB centrally purchases all foreign
   currencies and deposits these funds into designated foreign currency accounts to meet base-level
   requirements.
8                                                                AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003


    1.2.4. Disbursements. NAF AOs write checks as required (general and payroll) and notify HQ
    AFSVA/SVFB of such check issues (and related transactions) daily. The CMIP system reduces the
    issuing NAFIs cash-in-bank balance at the time the checks are reported to AFFMF. AFFMF main-
    tains an account at the principal concentration bank for clearing of base-level US dollar check issues.
    At the end of each day, the principal concentration bank transmits a list to AFFMF of checks cleared.
    HQ AFSVA/SVFB uses this data to match against the file of outstanding check issues reported by the
    NAF AOs and posts any variances to the CMIP statement for that date of business (DOB).
    1.2.5. Transfers. The CMIP system processes transfers of funds between NAFIs serviced by the
    same NAF AO. The NAF AO reports inter-NAFI transactions daily with deposit and disbursement
    data to HQ AFSVA/SVFB. One common form of transfer occurs for payrolls. The NAF AO reports
    all payroll checks as issued from the Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Fund and money is
    transferred from the appropriate NAFI to cover their share of the total payroll. The major commands
    (MAJCOM) issue their payroll checks against the MAJCOM MWR Fund.
    1.2.6. Remittances. Remittances are transactions which transfer funds within the CMIP system
    between a base NAFI and a MAJCOM or an Air Force NAFI, or between a MAJCOM NAFI and an
    Air Force NAFI. Examples include retirement contributions, insurance payments, loan repayments,
    deposit validations, and dividends.
    1.2.7. Related Systems. The bases send transactions to HQ AFSVA/SVFB representing insurance
    payments, payroll withholding for group insurance and retirement, workers' compensation, unem-
    ployment compensation, aero club liability insurance, Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF) assessment,
    deposits to a savings account (SAV), deposits to a severance account (SEV) (accumulation of cash to
    fund future severance of foreign national and CONUS employees), and so forth. From these inputs,
    the CMIP system creates transaction files used by other HQ AFSVA/SVFB programs such as Insur-
    ance, Retirement, and Workers' Compensation. Monthly, the AFFMF sends SAV and SEV statements
    only to those NAF AOs having accounts. These statements are usually sent out the second or third
    business day of each month.

1.3. Participation in CMIP. Participation is mandatory for all NAFIs meeting the following criteria
and is not permitted unless all four criteria are met.
    • A NAF AO keeps accounting records.
    • A NAF AO writes all checks.
    • The NAFI is separately identified as such in the Nonappropriated Fund Standard Accounting
        Management System (NAFSAMS) reports.
    • The NAFI is under the jurisdiction of the AFMWRAB or has been designated for participation by
        the Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund (AAFCWF).

1.4. Overdraft CMIP Accounts. HQ AFSVA/SVFB takes the following actions when a NAFI goes
into an overdraft status:
    • Adds a special announcement to the daily CMIP message to notify the base and MAJCOM that a
        NAFI is in an overdraft status.
    • Contacts the base NAF AO by telephone on the same day. Notifies the MAJCOM immediately if
        the overdraft is not a result of input errors or missing transmissions.
    • Monitors the NAFI for 5 workdays to ensure that corrective action is taken.
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                           9


  1.4.1. If no action is taken to correct the overdraft, HQ AFSVA/SVFB will transfer any savings
  account balance to cover the overdraft. If there are insufficient funds in the savings account to cover
  the overdraft, the funds will be transferred from the MAJCOM account by HQ AFSVA/SVFB to the
  base NAFI's account. If the NAFI is a lodging fund whose MAJCOM is centrally managing the cash
  balances, the funds necessary to cover the overdraft will be moved from the MAJCOM lodging fund
  account to the base-level lodging fund by HQ AFSVA/SVFB.
  1.4.2. HQ AFSVA/SVFB will send a message to the MAJCOM/SVF, installation commander, and
  SVS commander or director informing them that they are not to issue any more checks against the
  overdraft NAFI's account until further notice.
  1.4.3. The installation commander then initiates action to determine whether an assessment of pecu-
  niary liability is appropriate according to AFI 34-202, Protection of Assets.
  1.4.4. The MAJCOM successor NAFI shall issue all general and payroll checks necessary to meet
  any obligations of the overdraft NAFI until the overdraft situation is resolved and the MAJCOM noti-
  fies HQ AFSVA/SVFB of corrective action taken. HQ AFSVA/SVFB will notify the MAJCOM and
  the base when the overdraft NAFI can resume issuing checks.
  1.4.5. Any dollar transfer (TR) or cash transfer (CT) reported through the CMIP system which would
  cause a NAFI to go into an overdraft status will be rejected before processing. The error message
  explaining the reason for rejecting the transaction will be included on the daily CMIP statement.

                                       BANK RELATIONSHIPS

2.1. Field Banks. Field banks are the depositories for the CMIP and on-base banks are normally used
for this purpose. If there is no on-base bank, AFFMF designates a bank in the local area as a field bank.
The central cashier or the activities make all deposits to their designated field bank. There may be more
than one field bank associated with a base when remote sites, geographically separated operations, or
credit card accounts are involved. No other NAFI bank account is authorized without prior written
approval from HQ AFSVA/SVFB. Since field bank accounts are depository in nature, no locally drawn
checks may be issued against a field bank account, except for limited payee checks as specified by HQ
AFSVA/SVFB. For the purpose of this manual, credit unions are classified as field banks when they are
used as depositories.

2.2. Field Bank Account Ownership. Monies deposited in the field bank belong to AFFMF. NAFI
claims are against the AFFMF (as their bank) rather than the field bank or other CMIP-affiliated banks.
Only AFFMF may request bank statements or copies of bank statements from the field bank. These state-
ments are the property of AFFMF and not of the individual NAFI or servicing NAF AO. If a field bank
attempts to deliver such documents, they should be refused, and the bank instructed to mail them to HQ
AFSVA/SVFB, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 400, San Antonio TX 78216-4138. The AFFMF pays most
of the costs to maintain the field bank account through a combination of compensating balances and fees.
Fees associated with dishonored checks, deposit slips, night depository bags, and other special services, if
any, are to be paid by the NAFI concerned. If a field bank official should inquire about compensation,
notify HQ AFSVA/SVFB immediately. HQ AFSVA/SVFB, in turn, will contact the bank.

2.3. Cash Back Arrangements. Any arrangement with a field bank to obtain cash for deposited checks
is entirely at the risk of the NAFIs involved and must be supported by a deposit ticket which shows the
total deposit, less cash received, and net amount deposited. The Resource Management Flight Chief
(RMFC) makes all cash back arrangements. CMIP participation does not prevent such arrangements, but
they should be undertaken only with assurance of proper internal controls. The internal controls should
identify all personnel authorized to obtain cash for deposited checks and should require that an individual
other than the one receiving the cash validates the deposit ticket received from the bank. Cash back
arrangements cannot include the use of a debit advice to withdraw cash from the account.

2.4. Concentration Banks. Concentration banks are banks to which monies have been moved (concen-
trated) in order to optimize the AFFMF's cash management techniques. Concentration banks are not the
final depository of all CMIP monies, but are simply agents hired to perform a check clearing and staging
function. HQ AFSVA/SVFB temporarily invests excess funds in many institutions throughout the United
States pending disbursement. NAF AOs or NAFIs are not to contact a concentration bank. All contact
and interaction with a concentration bank is through HQ AFSVA/SVFB. Exceptions for overseas concen-
tration banks are explained in specific chapters.

2.5. Merchant Agreements. A Merchant Agreement is a contract with a bank to allow the NAFI to
accept Visa and Mastercard as payment for merchandise or services rendered. HQ AFSVA/SVFB fur-
nishes reporting instructions (including account information) and start-up date. No locally drawn checks
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                    11


may be issued against a credit card account. Base NAFIs pay all fees associated with those types of
accounts

                                                Chapter 3

                                          CMIP ACCOUNTS

3.1. NAFI Account Numbers. Each NAFI has its own 6-digit account number. The NAF AO and
activities use this account number for all CMIP, SAV, and SEV transactions. The account number is bro-
ken down into three segments. The first three digits are the base identifier and are common to all NAFIs
serviced by a NAF AO. The next two digits are the NAFI identifiers by type of NAFI. HQ AFSVA/
SVFB gives remote site NAFIs a separate 2-digit identifier to avoid duplication. The last digit is a "check
digit" used to ensure authenticity. MAJCOMs are informed of the NAFI account numbers for their
base-level NAFIs.

3.2. Daily Statements. The CMIP system transmits a statement to the servicing NAF AO's every busi-
ness day with an information copy transmitted simultaneously to the parent MAJCOM.

3.3. Payment of Interest. The interest rate paid to participating NAFIs is set by the AFMWRAB or
designee and is based upon the net earnings of the AFFMF. NAFIs earn interest based upon the
month-to-date average balance, compounded monthly.

3.4. Posting of CMIP Interest Earned. The interest earned for the prior month is posted to the CMIP
statement the first business day of the current month.

3.5. Consolidation or Establishment of NAFIs. The parent MAJCOM approves all requests for con-
solidation of NAFIs or establishment of a new NAFI. The MAJCOM gives HQ AFSVA/SVFB 5 work-
days advance notice to allow time to establish CMIP/SAV account numbers and provide conversion
instructions. If the NAFI requires a new field bank account, at least 10 workdays advance notice to HQ
AFSVA/SVFB is required.

3.6. Dissolution of a NAFI. The parent MAJCOM approves requests for dissolution of a NAFI. The
MAJCOM gives HQ AFSVA/SVFB 4 workdays advance notice. HQ AFSVA/SVFB provides dissolution
instructions. After the official dissolution date, HQ AFSVA/SVFB officially closes the NAFI CMIP
account when all outstanding checks have cleared the bank and a final deposit validation is performed.

3.7. MBF Closures/Changes. Contact HQ AFSVA/SVFB when you are notified that your bank will
close or merge with another bank. NAF AOs will not enter into any agreements to close or open any bank
accounts without first consulting HQ AFSVA/SVFB. This applies to all field bank accounts including
remote sites, merchant agreements, and credit card accounts.

3.8. Opening Field Bank Accounts. HQ AFSVA/SVFB opens all field bank accounts. The NAF AO or
the parent MAJCOM notifies HQ AFSVA/SVFB of the requirement a minimum of 2 weeks prior to need-
ing the account.. Pertinent account information, provided by HQ AFSVA/SVFB, is exchanged with the
field bank official, i.e., account number, bank's routing number, initial deposit slip order, etc. HQ
AFSVA/SVFB provides the field bank with a letter of instruction and all other documentation required by
the bank to establish the account. The bank official may request certain information that can only be fur-
nished by the NAFIs, such as change fund requirements. NAF AO personnel relay this information to the
bank.
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                            13


3.9. Closing Field Bank Accounts. NAF AOs must not close field bank accounts. The NAF AO or the
parent MAJCOM notifies HQ AFSVA/SVFB when an account is no longer required. HQ AFSVA/SVFB
officially informs the field bank of the closure by letter and transfers any remaining funds to the concen-
tration bank. Upon completion of the final deposit validation, HQ AFSVA/SVFB deletes the account
from the CMIP system's database. If HQ AFSVA/SVFB does not receive advance notification of a field
bank closure, the monthly bank service fees (normally paid by HQ AFSVA/SVFB) that occur after the
closure date will be paid by the base NAFI and withdrawn from the appropriate CMIP account by HQ
AFSVA/SVFB.

                                       FIELD BANK DEPOSITS

4.1. General Information Concerning Deposits. The central cashier or the activities make deposits to
designated HQ AFSVA/SVFB field bank accounts. Deposits are made within 1 business day of receipt
unless written approval to make deposits less often has been granted according to AFI 34-202. Bases ser-
viced by overseas MBFs, which use deposit slips displaying the number of items deposited, fill in the
blanks showing the number of items deposited by types of check.

4.2. Ordering Deposit Slips. The initial order of deposit slips is made by HQ AFSVA/SVFB when the
new account is opened. Thereafter, the NAF AO orders deposit slips directly from the field bank. Each
NAFI pays for their deposit slips. The deposit slip has "Air Force Financial Management Fund" printed on
the front. The NAFI or activity name is also printed or stamped on the deposit slips.

4.3. US Dollar Deposit Reporting. The NAF AO enters a 4-digit document number, in ink, on each
validated or unvalidated deposit slip. Use document numbers in numerical order by field bank account
beginning with 0001. The NAF AO must use a separate series of document numbers for each bank
account. For example, each remote site, merchant agreement or credit card account not depositing in the
on-base bank has a separate series of document numbers. After using document number 9999, start over
with document number 0001. Do not start a new series of document numbers at the beginning of a new
fiscal year. Report one transaction per deposit slip in the following format:

Blank                              50-80

4.4. US Dollar Checks Drawn on Foreign Banks. On occasion, a customer may present a US dollar
check drawn on a foreign bank to an activity for payment of services or goods. These checks are easily
identifiable by the bank name printed on the check, and normally the check will not contain the US stan-
dard Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoding on the bottom of a check. While the check is
written in US dollars, it is considered a "foreign item" since the funds cannot be collected within the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank check collection system. Field banks may either process these checks or return them
to the NAFI as an "uncollectible item." Ifthe field bank returns the check as an "uncollectible item," the
NAFI can forward the check to HQ AFSVA/SVFB for collection assistance. If the field bank processes
the check, the item will be posted as a part of the deposit and then debited back against the account. The
field bank will not give credit until the funds have actually been collected from the foreign bank. The col-
lection process can take from several weeks to several months. There is normally a substantial service fee
associated with these transactions. The AFFMF will pass these charges (when identifiable) to the MWR
fund at the base making the deposit. If local commanders insist on accepting these checks as a customer
service, the NAF AO should implement a charge to offset some or all of the cost of providing this service.

4.5. Foreign Currency Deposit Reporting. NAFIs are authorized to deposit local currency into the
existing AFFMF foreign currency accounts. The account number is the same as the AFFMF account on
which the foreign currency checks are written. Personal foreign currency checks are not authorized for
deposit. If a vendor check issued in foreign currency is returned, it is reported as a negative deposit. Input
a negative figure in data positions 30 and 59. If the local field bank will not accept foreign currency cash
deposits, NAFIs should attempt to exchange the currency for dollars at another MWR activity authorized
to sell foreign currency to customers. The exchange eliminates a currency exchange loss at the field bank
due to reconversion. Currency that NAFIs are unable to deposit or exchange internally, is converted to
dollars, deposited into the AFFMF dollar account, and reported via CMIP in accordance with paragraph
4.3. The NAF AO will notify HQ AFSVA/SVFB by message of all anticipated foreign currency deposits
in excess of $100,000.00, such as those generated by an open house, at least 10 working days prior to the
event. All currency deposited into a foreign currency account is reported via CMIP using the following
format:

4.6. Credit Card Deposit Reporting. If credit card deposits are made to the on-base bank, the NAF
AO regards the deposits as normal cash deposits and reports them with all other deposits as outlined in
paragraph 4.3. If the credit card deposits are made to another bank, the NAF AO uses a separate series of
document numbers for the deposit slips. The NAF AO reports transactions in the format given in para-
graph 4.3., except for data positions 1-2. Instead of "DP" use "BA", "MC", "OT" or other codes pre-
scribed by HQ AFSVA/SVFB to report credit card deposits. If more than one type of credit card is used
on a base (with more than one field bank account), the NAF AO uses a separate series of document num-
bers for the deposit slips for each bank account. Transaction type will be assigned by HQ AFSVA/SVFB
at the time the contract is approved. Be sure not to confuse the series of document numbers or the depos-
its will be rejected or shown as missing in paragraph 3 of the daily CMIP statement.

4.7. Off-Base Deposit Reporting. One or more NAFIs on a base may make deposits to more than one
bank (other than credit card accounts). An example is a recreation area operating far from the on-base
bank. Deposits are made in a bank near the recreation area. In this instance, report deposits as outlined in
4.3.paragraph 4.3., except report "OB" instead of "DP" in data positions 1-2. Use a separate series of doc-
ument numbers.

4.8. Credit Memo Reporting. Credit memos issued by field banks are posted on the bank statement
like normal deposits. Number credit memos using the same series of document numbers as deposits, and
report to CMIP following the format in paragraph 4.3. For credit card accounts in off-base banks, use
transaction type "MC", "BA", "OT" or other codes as prescribed by HQ AFSVA/SVFB in data positions
1-2.

4.9. Debit Memo Reporting:
   4.9.1. Report all dishonored checks, excluding off-base "OB" bank accounts, as a "DC" transaction
   type. Use a separate 4-digit series of document numbers beginning with 0001 for each field bank.
   Report a transaction for the total of each dishonored check debit memo as outlined in paragraph 4.3.,
   except enter "DC" in data positions 1-2. Do not report individual checks if the bank lists more than
18                                                                AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003


     one check on the debit memo. Use a dollar transfer to reimburse the MWR fund for checks belonging
     to other NAFIs. For off-base banks (as outlined in paragraph 4.7. ), enter "OC" instead of "DC" in
     data positions 1-2.
     4.9.2. Report debit memos from the field bank, which adjust the amount of a validated deposit, as
     negative deposits. Use the formats in paragraphs 4.3. and 4.5. A negative character is used in data
     position 30.
     4.9.3. Always report bank debit memos for off-base credit card accounts as negative deposits. Follow
     deposit reporting in paragraph 4.7. and input a negative character in data position 30.

4.10. US Dollar Deposit Corrections:
     4.10.1. When an error in the amount of a deposit is identified after reporting or if the field bank has
     changed the total of a deposit slip amount upon validation, an adjustment needs to be reported. This
     adjustment is the net difference between the reported amount and the correct amount. Report an
     adjustment in the format shown in paragraph 4.3. Use the document number and DOB of the original
     deposit reported, and enter "ADJ" in data positions 31-33. If the amount of the adjustment is a
     decrease, use a negative character in data position 30 as well as the "ADJ" in data positions 31-33.
     Only one adjustment can be made to a reported document number. Use instructions in paragraph 4.13.
     when adjusting deposits reported in the prior month.
     4.10.2. If the deposit to be corrected is for an off-base credit card account, the instructions in para-
     graph 4.10.1. apply, except the transaction type will be "MC," "BA," or "OT" as outlined in paragraph
     4.6.

4.11. Foreign Currency Deposit Corrections. If an error is found in the amount of a foreign currency
deposit after it has been reported, an adjustment is required. This adjustment is the net difference between
the reported amount and the correct amount. Report an adjustment in the format shown in paragraph 4.5.
Use the document number of original deposit reported, original DOB, and original foreign currency
exchange rate. Enter "ADJ" in data positions 31-33. If the amount of the adjustment is a decrease, use a
negative character in data position 30 and data position 69. Only one adjustment can be made to a
reported document number. See paragraph 4.13. for further instructions when adjusting deposits reported
in the prior month.

4.12. Debit Memo Corrections:
     4.12.1. A "DC" transaction is an automatic decrease to CMIP. To increase the CMIP balance and
     decrease the negative amount reported, use the transaction format in paragraph 4.3., and enter "DC" in
     data positions 1-2, "ADJ" in data positions 31-33, and the negative character in data position 30. To
     increase the negative amount reported, follow instructions in paragraphs 4.3. and 4.10., and enter
     "ADJ" in data positions 31-33. Use the original document number and DOB of the debit being
     adjusted. Only one adjustment can be made to a reported document number. See paragraph 4.13. for
     further instructions when adjusting debit memos reported in the prior month.
     4.12.2. To correct or adjust a negative deposit reported on an off-base credit card account, follow
     instructions in paragraph 4.10. Use the original document number and DOB of the debit, and enter
     "ADJ" in data positions 31-33. If the adjustment increases the negative amount reported and
     decreases the CMIP balance, use a negative character in data position 30. If the adjustment decreases
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                              19


   the negative amount reported and increases the CMIP balance, do not use the negative character in
   data position 30.

4.13. Late Reporting and Prior Month Corrections. Report deposits, debit and credit memos, and
adjustments to any of these entries during the first 4 business days of each month. HQ AFSVA/SVFB
considers the transactions as a part of the prior month's business for deposit validation purposes only, pro-
vided that the correct DOB is used. Example: additional entries for September, reported on any of the
first 4 business days of October, must contain the September DOB in data positions 40-45. See paragraph
10.2. for additional information on the effect this has on the deposit validation variance.

                      CHECK STOCKS AND SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS

5.1. General Information Concerning Checks. There are five types of checks which CMIP partici-
pants can use:
    • Automated General Purpose.
    • Automated Payroll.
    • Limited Payee (overseas only).
    • Foreign Currency General Purpose (overseas only).
    • Automated Foreign Currency Payroll (overseas only).
All check types listed above have an 8-digit check number for CMIP reporting purposes. The first three
digits of General Purpose, Limited Payee, and Foreign Currency (FC) checks are the base identifier and
the last five digits are the actual check number. Compute the first digit of the payroll check number by
adding five to the first digit of the base identifier. Not all foreign currency checks have the complete
8-digit check number printed on the check due to the different banking regulations in each country. If the
check number imprinted is less than five positions, zero fill to the left when reporting the foreign currency
check issue.

5.2. Ordering Check Stocks. HQ AFSVA/SVFB places all check stock reorders, with the exception of
some foreign currency checks, with the vendor. The AFFMF pays for the check stock. NAF AOs must
reorder check stocks from HQ AFSVA/SVFB not later than (NLT) 120 days prior to exhausting current
check stock supplies. NAF AOs should inventory check stock on a regular basis to ensure accountability,
an adequate supply, and accomplishment of reorders in a timely manner.
     5.2.1. NAF AOs send check stock reorders to: HQ AFSVA/SVFB, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 400,
     San Antonio TX 78216-4138, using the following format for check type required:
         • Check Type Required: US General, US Payroll, Limited Payee, FC General, or FC Payroll.
         • Quantity of Reorder: Quantity of checks being reordered.
         • Estimated number of checks used per month: Quantity of checks used (if payroll checks are
            being reordered, list number of checks used per payroll including leader checks).
         • Last check number on hand: Last check number recorded as being received from HQ
            AFSVA/SVFB as stated on your inventory control log.
         • CONUS Address: No Post Office Boxes; checks are shipped United Parcel Service (UPS).
         • Point of Contact (POC): Person to contact regarding check orders.
         • Local Phone Number (CONUS Only).
         • DSN Number.
     5.2.2. After receiving and processing the check reorder, HQ AFSVA/SVFB sends a confirmation let-
     ter or message to the NAF AO confirming date of order, check numbers ordered, and verification of
     check order instructions. Upon receipt of the new check order, verify the check printing detail against
     the confirmation letter or message. Notify HQ AFSVA/SVFB within five workdays after receipt of
     the check order and note any discrepancies as prescribed in the confirmation letter or message. To
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                              21


   ensure that the check reorder is received and processed in a timely manner, the NAF AO should con-
   tact HQ AFSVA/SVFB if not notified that the order has been processed within 30 days of the date of
   the reorder request.

5.3. Signature Requirements on Checks . Delete Two authorized signatories must sign all checks of
$50,000 or more. The concentration bank and the overseas MBFs will return checks of $50,000 or more
which do not bear two signatories to the vendor unpaid.”

5.4. Signature Changes. When updating and changing authorized signatories, use the following proce-
dures:
   5.4.1. Signature Changes for the Principal Concentration Bank Account. Use the cards pro-
   vided by the concentration bank to update and change signatures. HQ AFSVA/SVFB furnishes these
   cards to the NAF AO upon request. For each signature addition, submit two cards, each signed once
   by the individual being added. Type the name of the base at the top of each card. Send a cover letter,
   signed by a currently authorized signatory, to HQ AFSVA/SVFB with the cards attached. The letter
   contains the names and titles of all individuals authorized to sign and the effective date. Also, the let-
   ter should show which individuals are being added or deleted from the last letter of authorization.
   Allow a minimum of 2 weeks for processing time.
   5.4.2. Signature Changes for Limited Payee and Foreign Currency Bank Accounts. T h e N A F
   AO obtains signature cards for additions and deletions from the local MBF. For each signature
   change, submit a complete set of cards to HQ AFSVA/SVFB, with every authorized individual's sig-
   nature on the new set of cards. Type the base name at the top of each card. Send a cover letter, signed
   by a currently authorized signatory, to HQ AFSVA/SVFB with the signature cards. The contents of
   the letter of authorization are described in paragraph 5.4.1. Upon receipt and processing, HQ AFSVA/
   SVFB forwards the cards directly to the MBF headquarters. Be sure to allow for sufficient mail time
   (minimum four weeks).

5.5. Check Numbering. Issue all checks in numerical order. Do not "skip ahead" or reserve checks for
end-of-month (EOM) processing.

5.6. Reporting US Dollar General Checks. For each general check issued, report a check issue (CI)
transaction in the following format:

In the case of a remote site serviced by a NAF AO, use a locally approved form for check issue authoriza-
tion. The remote site custodian or designee signs the authorization prior to check preparation.

5.7. Reporting US Dollar Payroll Checks. Normally, the Nonappropriated Fund Management Infor-
mation System (NAFMIS) program prepares payroll checks. During NAFMIS payroll processing, the
payroll "CI" transactions are computer generated. Note that the NAFMIS program changes the first digit
of the base identifier by adding five to generate the check numbers. Verification of the payroll checks is
essential to ensure that the computer-generated check number in the upper right hand corner of the check
is the same as the MICR encoded check number in the lower left hand corner of the check. If they do not
agree, the NAFMIS generated check issue data is incorrect. Reaccomplish the "CI" transactions input for
NAFMIS payroll to show the correct MICR encoded check number. When issuing checks manually or
off-line, complete all data positions shown in paragraph 5.6.

5.8. Reporting US Dollar Void Checks. If a check is spoiled during preparation or voided prior to
being issued, report a transaction using the format in paragraph 5.6., but enter "CV" in data positions 1-2
and zero fill data positions 13-22. Report this type of voided check using the MWR Fund CMIP account

lar amount at which issued in data positions 13-22 and the CMIP account number of the issuing NAFI in
data positions 32-37. Use the original DOB when reporting a "CV" transaction.

5.9. Stop Payment Action, US Dollar Checks. CONUS bases call HQ AFSVA/SVFB by phone to
request a check inquiry. HQ AFSVA/SVFB personnel will make the inquiry and contact the NAF AO. If
the check has not been paid, the NAF AO can request HQ AFSVA/SVFB take stop payment action. HQ
AFSVA/SVFB personnel follow-up with the NAF AO that stop payment action is completed. Do not
issue a new check or void the original check until stop payment action has been completed. Furnish the
following information to HQ AFSVA/SVFB on all stop payment actions.
    • Date of check issue.
    • Name of payee.
    • Amount of check.
    • Reason for stop payment
    • Full 8-digit check number.
NAF AOs at overseas bases send a message to HQ AFSVA/SVFB providing the information shown
above. HQ AFSVA/SVFB completes a check inquiry and initiates stop payment action if the check is
unpaid. When stop payment action is completed, HQ AFSVA/SVFB personnel will notify the NAF AO
with reissue instructions. Submission of a "CV" transaction does not constitute stop payment action. It is
the policy of the principal concentration bank to pay all checks cleared on a given day. The checks are
then sent to the proof department for stop payment verification. Therefore, it is possible for a check to
appear under paragraph 3 of the daily CMIP statement as a check paid over a void or as a check paid with-
out issue. However, when it is determined that a check is to be returned because of a stop payment, the
charge for the check is reversed by the bank and a credit memo is issued by the bank. As many as 4 busi-
ness days may pass before the reversal appears on the daily CMIP Statement. See 11.4.paragraph 11.4 for
instructions to write off checks with stale dates.

5.10. Use of Limited Payee (LP) Checks. LP checks are paid against overseas US dollar bank
accounts. LP checks are used for the purpose of obtaining US dollar cash for change or imprest funds
and, in specific countries, for the purchase of foreign currency for accommodation sales. Cash LP checks
the same day as issued or NLT the day following issue. Facsimile signatures are not authorized on LP
checks.

5.11. Reporting, Voiding, and Stopping Payment on LP Checks. Report transactions as outlined in
paragraph 5.6., except enter "LP" in data positions 1-2. Void checks as outlined in paragraph 5.8., except
enter "LV" in data positions 1-2. Stop payment actions on LP checks are not authorized. Contact HQ
AFSVA/SVFB for instructions on lost checks.

5.12. Use of General Purpose and Automated Payroll Foreign Currency Checks. Foreign currency
checks pay against foreign currency disbursement accounts for employee payroll, vendor, and construc-
tion payments. Some countries use automated foreign currency payroll checks to pay foreign national
employees. HQ AFSVA/SVFB purchases foreign currency to meet normal daily usage. Unusually large
requirements such as employee bonuses, fixed asset purchases, and construction payments require addi-
tional foreign currency. Ten days prior to disbursing unusually large checks, the NAF AO notifies HQ
AFSVA/SVFB to ensure the check does not cause an overdraft status in the MBF foreign currency
account. Overdrawn accounts incur additional expenses and are not acceptable banking practice. Note:
When general checks are issued to meet foreign currency payrolls, the foreign currency check stock
must not be separated into two series of numbers. Issue all checks in strict numerical sequence.

5.15. Stop Payment Action, Foreign Currency Checks. Authorized NAF AO personnel initiate all
stop payments for foreign currency checks through the local MBF. After placing the stop payment, send
an information only message containing the following information to HQ AFSVA/SVFB.
    • Date of stop payment.
    • Date of check issue.
    • Name of payee.
    • FC amount of check.
    • Reason for stop payment.
    • Full 8-digit check number.

5.16. Corrections to Check Issue and Void Transactions Reported. HQ AFSVA/SVFB makes any
corrective action for all types of check issues or check void transactions. Corrective actions relating to
dollar amounts appear as remittances on the daily CMIP statements. The NAF AO requests corrective
action by sending a message containing the following information to HQ AFSVA/SVFB:
    • Date of CMIP statement on which the error occurred.
    • Full 8-digit check number.
    • Incorrect information accepted.
    • Correct information.
    • Net adjustment to check, when increase or decrease is correcting dollar value of check. When
        correcting FC checks, net adjustment to dollar equivalent amount and foreign currency amount is
        required.

5.17. US Dollar General and Payroll Emergency Check Stock. It may be necessary for the NAF AO
to obtain emergency checks due to nonreceipt of check reorders or inadequate check inventory proce-
dures. The NAF AOs at CONUS and PACAF bases send a message to HQ AFSVA/SVFB for emergency
checks. Bases located in Europe should contact HQ USAFE/SVF. Use emergency checks only until reg-
ular check reorders are received. At the top of each check issued, type the name of the base so that ven-
dors can identify who issued the check.

5.18. Reporting Emergency Check Issue Transactions. When using emergency checks for either
general or payroll checks, special reporting procedures must be followed. Ensure that data positions 3
through 5 of the check issue transaction (paragraph 5.6. ) contain the emergency check stock ID number
of 499 for general checks or 999 for payroll checks, while data positions 32 through 37 must contain the
NAFI CMIP account number to be charged. Emergency payroll checks cannot be processed through
NAFMIS for reporting to CMIP without special procedures. The check issue transactions may have to be
entered individually as an addition to the CMIP transmission created by the accounting system. Contact
HQ AFSVA/SVFB for instructions.

5.19. Reporting Emergency Check Stock Void Checks. The NAF AO uses procedures in paragraph
5.8. to void checks. Ensure data positions 3 through 5 contain the 499 or 999 identifiers.

5.20. Foreign Currency Accommodation Sales. The NAFIs make accommodation sales of foreign
currency at a rate no more favorable than the rate of accommodation exchanges currently charged by the
28                                                            AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003


MBF for individual customers. Purchase of foreign currencies is made using "LP" or "FC" checks,
depending on the country. The NAF AO marks the check (not the stub) "Accommodation Sales". Accord-
ing to DoD directives, any charge for accommodation sales by the MBF appears later at the time of peri-
odic settlement with the MBF.

                                INTER-NAFI DOLLAR TRANSFERS

6.1. Use of Dollar Transfers. Do not write checks between NAFIs that are serviced by the same NAF
AO. Use a dollar transfer. The disbursing NAFI initiates the transfer. The RMFC or a designee signs AF
Form 1804, NAF Interfund Dollar Transfer. Transfers are also used in conjunction with SAV and SEV
accounts as described in Chapter 12 .

6.2. Numbering of Transfers. Each dollar transfer has a 5-digit document number. The first two digits
are a NAFI identifier (explained in paragraph 3.1. and the last three digits are the actual document number
of the transfer. The document number series for transfers is 001 through 999. Number transfers consec-
utively. Begin a new series of document numbers when 999 has been used, starting again with 001. Do
not start a new series of document numbers at the beginning of a new fiscal year. Each NAFI must have
its own series of document numbers. Ensure the first two digits of the document number (data positions
47-48) match the NAFI identifier of the disbursing NAFI (data positions 56-57) or the transfer will reject.

6.3. Reporting Dollar Transfers. Report a transaction for each transfer in the following format:

6.4. Payroll Transfers. All payroll checks are issued against the MWR fund for both bases and MAJ-
COMs. Each NAFI transfers funds to the MWR fund or MAJCOM MWR fund to meet its share of the
expense. Only one transfer per NAFI is made each pay period for the gross payroll.

6.5. Transfers Outside the NAF AO. Transfers to or from the parent MAJCOM or an Air Force NAFI
are called remittances and are explained in Chapter 7. Make payments to another base or the parent
MAJCOM, other than those made by "CT" transactions, by check.

                                         CMIP REMITTANCES

7.1. General Information on Remittances. Remittances are CMIP transactions between a base NAFI
and a MAJCOM NAFI or an Air Force NAFI. They are also used between a MAJCOM NAFI and an Air
Force NAFI. Examples of remittances are retirement or group insurance contributions, insurance pay-
ments, loan repayments, DP validations, assessments, check and deposit corrections, and automated reim-
bursement for approved capital expenditure projects.

7.2. Recording Remittances. HQ AFSVA/SVFB shows all remittances initiated from base-level NAF
AOs, MAJCOMs, or HQ USAF in the remittance column of paragraph 1 of the daily CMIP Statement.
Paragraph 2 of the daily CMIP Statement explains the reason for the remittance. Upon receipt of the
statement, increase or decrease GLAC (General Ledger Account Code) 101, Cash in Bank, as indicated,
unless it has already been recorded in the general ledger. If already recorded, verify that the amount and
other details are correct. Reverse accruals before recording the actual remittance. In some instances, do
not record the DP validation remittance to GLAC 101. See Chapter 10 .

7.3. Group Insurance Remittances. Each pay period, the NAF AO transmits a group insurance remit-
tance for premiums due the Air Force Insurance Fund (AFIF). Report the transaction as follows:

7.4. NAF Retirement Remittances. Each pay period, the NAF AO transmits a NAF retirement remit-
tance to the Air Force Employee Retirement Plan Trust (AFERPT) for employees enrolled in the NAF
Retirement Program. Report the transaction in the same format as in paragraph 7.3., except enter "RE" in
data positions 1-2, "RETIRE" in data positions 61-66 and the total number of retirement detail transac-
tions being transmitted in data positions 47-51.

7.5. Corrections for Group Insurance and NAF Retirement Remittances. If an error is made in
reporting group insurance or NAF retirement remittances, do not attempt to make any corrections. Notify
HQ AFSVA/SVXB by phone or message of the error. HQ AFSVA/SVXB will give further instructions at
that time.

7.6. Workers' Compensation and Unemployment:
     7.6.1. General Information. The payroll figures for this report are available from the Payroll Inter-
     face to General Ledger (PRIGL), which is processed each pay period. Refer to AFMAN 34-214, Pro-
     cedures for NAF Financial Management and Accounting.
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                           33


   7.6.2. Premium Assessment. The appropriate premium rate is applied to the biweekly payroll fig-
   ures in calculating the premium amount due. The assessment is then sent with the daily CMIP trans-
   mission using the prescribed "CT" format (see Attachment 2 ). Workers' Compensation and
   Unemployment each have a unique format and are reported individually. These negative remittances
   appear on the daily CMIP Statement as a decrease to the NAFI's CMIP balance. An explanation for
   this decrease appears in paragraph 2 of the CMIP statement.
   7.6.3. Payment of Claims. HQ AFSVA/SVXB uses a positive remittance to reimburse employing
   NAFIs for workers' compensation claim payments made by the base. Each positive remittance
   appears in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the CMIP statement. These amounts are identified by claim number
   in paragraph 2 of the daily CMIP Statement.

7.7. Automated Reimbursements. The automated reimbursement system is designed to assist the flow
of funds through CMIP for those projects or programs that receive Air Force support. Each base, remote
site, and MAJCOM has two designated automated reimbursement account (ARA) numbers. One is used
for special programs that qualify for reimbursement and the other is used for approved capital expenditure
projects. Using a "CT" transaction with the applicable NAFI and correct project number, generates reim-
bursement on the DOB following the DOB on which the transaction is input. Supporting documentation
remains at the base-level AO and is subject to review.
   7.7.1. Report one "CT" transaction for each check issued for payment on a project or program reim-
   bursed by Air Force. Report the "CI" transaction with the same DOB as the "CT", unless the amount
   of the check is large enough to cause an overdraft of the CMIP account. If an overdraft would occur,
   report the "CI" on the DOB following the date the "CT" was input. The amount of the check issue
   must not exceed the amount of the "CT" input for reimbursement.
   7.7.2. See Attachment 2 for "CT" purpose field reporting format used in data positions 3-30. Data
   position 38 of the "CT" transaction must be a negative or the amount requested will be deducted from
   the CMIP account instead of reimbursed. For assistance in making any needed corrections, contact
   HQ AFSVA/SVFB.
   7.7.3. Automated reimbursement remittances appear in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the daily CMIP State-
   ment. For accounting entries applicable to a specific reimbursement, see AFMAN 34-214.

7.8. Asset and Liability Insurance Assessments. HQ AFSVA/SVFF calculates the premiums for asset
and liability insurance as of 31 December, 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September of each fiscal year (FY)
using data from the nonappropriated fund financial statements. The assessments create negative remit-
tances which appear on the daily CMIP statement as a decrease to the NAFI CMIP balance.

7.9. Aircraft Hull Insurance Assessments. Aero clubs report aircraft status via RCS: HAF-SV(Q)
9495, Aero Club Operations Report. HQ AFSVA/SVFF uses information from the report to calculate air-
craft hull insurance assessments as of 31 December, 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September of each FY.
Assessments are charged as a remittance to the CMIP account on or about the end of the second month
following the end of each fiscal quarter. For additional information, see AFMAN 34-214.

7.10. Aircraft Liability Insurance Assessments. HQ AFSVA/SVFF also calculates and charges air-
craft liability assessments as described in paragraph 7.9.

7.11. TLF Assessment. Base TLF assessments on occupied units. See AFMAN 34-214, for assessment
computation instructions. Prepare a CT transaction for each rate charged, before the 15th work day of
each month. The CT contains the previous month's business. See Attachment 2 for "CT" purpose field
reporting format.

7.12. Reimbursable TLF Purchase. For new TLF construction, the Air Force Lodging Fund reim-
burses the base for the initial furniture and equipment purchase. (See AFMAN 34-214.) The NAF AO
prepares a check issue and a CT transaction for reimbursement on the same DOB. See Attachment 2 for
"CT" purpose field reporting format.

8.1. General Information. Instructions and procedures as outlined in other chapters generally apply to
MAJCOM NAFIs. Additional procedures for MAJCOMs are provided below. For special dividends
received from AFMWRF by the MAJCOMs, use the same procedures as for base-level MWR funds.

8.2. MAJCOM Transfers. MAJCOMs can make transfers to or from base-level CMIP NAFIs. Trans-
fers may only be made between MWR NAFIs or between Lodging NAFIs. To enter a positive or negative
cash transfer, use the following format:

Base-level NAFIs have limited use of the "CT" transaction for automated reimbursements. See Chapter
7.

8.3. Command Lodging Fund (CLF). CLFs withdraw and allocate funds from their lodging funds to
base-level lodging funds. The MAJCOM uses a "CT" transaction type (see paragraph 8.2. ) to transfer the
funds.

                               REPORTING CMIP TRANSACTIONS

9.1. General Information on Reporting. The NAF AO transmits the CMIP transactions five times
weekly, Monday through Friday, except for holidays and other non-business days. Use AUTODIN or
DDN to report the CMIP transactions.

9.2. Timing of Transmissions. Transmit CMIP reports not earlier than (NET) 0800 and NLT 2200 on
the first business day after DOB being reported. Bases across the international date line, which include
Japan, Korea, and Guam transmit NET 0800 and NLT 1200 the second business day after DOB being
reported. For EOM and holiday transmissions, see paragraphs 9.5. and 9.6.

9.3. Transmissions Not Received by HQ AFSVA/SVFB. When reviewing the CMIP statement, if a
day's transmission is not updated, immediately retransmit all transactions for that particular day's report-
ing. There is no need to send a message or to call HQ AFSVA/SVFB for further instructions.

9.4. Dating of Transactions. The DOB is the day the sale was made, the check was dated, the transfer
was made, etc. For deposits, the DOB is the date of the cashier's report. All transactions to cash made or
to be made in the general ledger for a given date are reported to CMIP. Include Saturday's and Sunday's
transactions with Monday's DOB. When a month ends on a weekend, follow reporting instructions in
paragraph 9.5. When a holiday falls on a week day, follow reporting instructions in paragraph 9.6.
Activities with authorized waivers from daily bank deposits use the DOB of the last business day included
in the deposits. The activity must make a deposit at the close of business, the last business day of each
month, regardless of dollar amount (see AFI 34-202, Protection of Assets).

9.5. End-of-Month Reporting. When the last day of a given month falls on a weekend, adjust the
CMIP transmission to AFMWRAB. Follow procedures as outlined below:
   9.5.1. EOM Saturday. Transmit Friday's and Saturday's DOB on Monday with all transactions
   dated with Saturday's date.
   9.5.2. EOM Sunday. Transmit Friday's, Saturday's, and Sunday's DOB on Monday with all transac-
   tions dated with Sunday's date.
   9.5.3. CMIP Statements. The procedures in paragraphs 9.5.1. and 9.5.2. allow end-of-month
   GLAC 101 balances and financial statements to match with the daily CMIP Statements.

9.7. AUTODIN Transmissions. The NAF AO initiates AUTODIN transmissions. The NAF AO cre-
ates a floppy disk for each DOB. From the floppy disk, a file is built to be processed through AUTODIN.
Creation of the floppy disk is covered in Chapter 13. The addressee routing indicator used is RHWR-
MAY. This is the routing indicator for magnetic tape output to the AFMWRAB. If any other routing
indicator is used, the transactions will not update CMIP.

9.8. AUTODIN Text Header Record. One text header record is created for each transmission. The
text header record must include the data required by the Communication Center.

         DEPOSIT VALIDATIONS AND LIMITED PAYEE CHECK RECONCILIATIONS

10.1. Deposit Validations. The purpose of a deposit validation is to ensure that all deposits, debit and
credit memos, and adjustments reported and accepted by HQ AFSVA/SVFB agree with those posted by
the field bank for the same period of time. Upon receipt of the field bank statement, HQ AFSVA/SVFB
compares the deposits, debit and credit memos, and adjustments reported and accepted to the entries
posted on the field bank statement. Any differences become a net deposit validation variance, which HQ
AFSVA/SVFB posts to the MWR fund account (except remote sites) and which appears as a remittance
on the daily CMIP statement.

10.2. Explanation of DP Validation Products and Their Use. H Q A F S VA / S V F B a s s e m b l e s a
deposit validation package for each bank account and mails it to the NAF AO. This package contains the
following documents:
     10.2.1. Bank Versus Base Variance Report. See Attachment 3 for an explanation of the data
     which appears on the report.
     10.2.2. Monthly Deposit Report (AURCMIPDPRP). The AURCMIPDPRP report recaps all
     deposits (credits) and debits reported and accepted from the first DOB of the month to the last DOB of
     the month. The cover sheet shows the total amount of debit memos and the total amount of deposits
     accepted in the month for all NAFIs. Totals for each category by individual NAFIs are also shown.
     The supporting documentation for the cover sheet shows the individual transactions which make up
     the totals on the cover sheet. The report is broken out by message DOB, but also shows the original
     DOB entered in the transaction if different from the message DOB the transaction was accepted. Each
     message DOB has a net total for both debit memos and deposits. This report also shows any items that
     were moved to in-transit for use in the next month's reconciliation. Items moved to in-transit normally
     appear as a part of the deposits reported on the last DOB of the month.
     10.2.3. Deposits and Adjustments in Current Month (TRNDEP). This product recaps the late
     reporting of deposits, debit and credit memos, and adjustments. HQ AFSVA/SVFB compares these
     deposits, debit and credit memos, and adjustments to the field bank statements. If any of the entries
     are posted by the bank, HQ AFSVA/SVFB makes a manual adjustment to the AURCMIPDPRP prod-
     uct. Only items reported during the first four business days of the current month, and which have a
     prior month's business date in data positions 40-45, are considered for DP validation purposes.
     10.2.4. Adding Machine Tape. HQ AFSVA/SVFB includes an adding machine tape of all debit
     memos which make up the total posted on line 2 of the Bank Versus Base Variance Report (see
     Attachment 3) in the DP validation package. HQ AFSVA/SVFB makes this tape from the bank state-
     ment and records the items in the same date sequence as recorded by the bank. The tape begins with
     the last day of the prior month, if applicable.
     10.2.5. Other Supporting Documents. HQ AFSVA/SVFB returns any deposit slips and debit or
     credit memos enclosed with the bank statement to the NAF AO.
     10.2.6. Probable Variance. If there is a difference in the ending total (line 5) on the Bank Versus
     Base Variance Report, HQ AFSVA/SVFB researches the difference and makes a listing of probable
     items creating the variance. Upon receipt of the DP validation package, the NAF AO reviews those
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                           43


   entries listed as probable variance and makes the appropriate corrections. The following are common
   entries that create a variance and the actions necessary to correct the variance:
       10.2.6.1. When a base reports an entry in one month and the bank posts the entry in a different
       month, a variance occurs. For example: A base reported a deposit on 28 September but the bank
       did not post the deposit to the bank statement until 1 October. The deposit becomes a negative
       variance in September as a deposit reported by the base and not posted by the bank. In October,
       the bank posts the deposit and creates a positive variance as a deposit posted by the bank and not
       reported by the base. These entries are called "wash" items. For this variance, no corrective
       action is needed. However, the NAF AO prepares a memo for record to the cash control summary
       of what the variance is and the month it will wash. Wash items should never appear on AF Form
       1736, NAF Cash Management and Investment Program Account Verification, for more than
       one month. The only possible exception is when research shows that a bank made the error; an
       additional month may pass before the bank makes the correction. Debit and credit memos can
       also be wash items.
       10.2.6.2. HQ AFSVA/SVFB research shows a deposit posted by the bank in an amount different
       than the base reported. If the difference has not been reported, do not report it because when HQ
       AFSVA/SVFB posts the variance, the base CMIP account is updated. If the difference applies to
       a NAFI other than the MWRF, the NAF AO makes a dollar transfer to move (increase or decrease
       as applicable) the variance from the MWRF to the NAFI affected. If no prior entry has been made,
       the NAF AO makes a journal voucher (JV) to update the general ledger cash-in-bank account for
       the proper NAFI. Follow the same procedures for debit and credit memo variances. If HQ
       AFSVA/SVFB research on the variance indicates a bank error, it becomes a wash item. The NAF
       AO shows the field bank the documentation (validated deposit ticket, copy of bank debit or credit
       memo) and requests a correction. When the bank makes the correction, it is a part of that month's
       variance and reverses the original variance. Call HQ AFSVA/SVFB for assistance, if needed.
       10.2.6.3. If the bank posts a deposit and research shows it is a valid deposit that has not been
       reported, follow the instructions outlined in paragraph 10.2.6.2.

10.3. Foreign Currency (FC) Deposit Validation (Overseas Only). The monthly deposit report (see
paragraph 10.2.2.) used for the foreign currency deposit validation shows foreign currency amounts only.
All information in paragraphs 10.1. and 10.2. applies to the foreign currency deposit validation. There is
an additional line on Bank Versus Base Variance Report which shows the rate used for conversion. The
foreign currency exchange rate used for conversion is the rate for the DOB the variance is posted to the
CMIP statement. HQ AFSVA/SVFB enters the foreign currency variance and the foreign currency
exchange rate, and the CMIP System posts the US dollar equivalent of the variance. The US dollar equiv-
alent appears as a remittance in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the CMIP statement.

10.4. LP Check Reconciliation (Overseas Only). This reconciliation is a comparison of LP checks
reported and accepted versus LP checks paid by the bank.
   10.4.1. Explanation of LP Reconciliation Products and Their Use. HQ AFSVA/SVFB prepares
   and mails an LP check reconciliation to each NAF AO using LP checks. This reconciliation contains
   the following documents:
       10.4.1.1. LP Check Reconciliation Report. This reconciliation summarizes the LP checks
       reported and accepted, plus prior month's outstanding LP checks paid during the current month,
44                                                               AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003


        less any current month's LP checks reported but not paid by the bank. HQ AFSVA/SVFB explains
        any variances in detail.
        10.4.1.2. Limited Payee Check Report (OSCHK). This product shows each LP check
        reported by DOB, check number, 2-digit NAFI identifier, and dollar amount. HQ AFSVA/SVFB
        adjusts this report manually for those prior month items reported during the first four business
        days of the current month; use the prior month's DOB in data positions 25-30.
        10.4.1.3. LP Checks. HQ AFSVA/SVFB returns the checks to the NAF AO if they are enclosed
        in the bank statements.
     10.4.2. Probable Variance. If an LP check is charged paid without issue, the base NAF AO
     researches to determine if the check was issued as a "CI" in error. If the LP check was reported and
     accepted as a "CI", the NAF AO reports a "CV" transaction to HQ AFSVA/SVFB and makes a dollar
     transfer to the MWR fund from the affected NAFI (if applicable). If a check is paid in an amount dif-
     ferent than issue and research shows a bank error was made, the NAF AO takes the check to the bank
     and requests a correction. If the paid LP check has not been returned, the NAF AO notifies HQ
     AFSVA/SVFB for assistance. The variance created due to the bank error will wash with a reversing
     variance in the month the bank makes the correction.

                            RECONCILIATION OF CMIP ACCOUNTS

11.1. General Information Concerning Reconciliations. There are several types of reconciliations
that are accomplished by NAF AO personnel when balancing CMIP to the General Ledger. Each are
described in detail in the following paragraphs.

11.2. CMIP Cash Report. A cash control summary is maintained as described in AFMAN 34-214.
The NAF AO uses one of the three following methods for daily reconciliations of the CMIP balances and
the cash control accounts balances.
    • A manual spreadsheet.
    • A computer spreadsheet program.
    • The accounting system programs also provide a report, CMIP List, with totals by record types and
       sorted by CMIP account number. The report is produced daily prior to downloading and transmit-
       ting records.
Reconcile deposits and disbursements to control totals and source documents, make any corrections
required due to rejected transactions, and compute the new daily balance using the net change figure on
the listing. This amount should agree with the amount on daily CMIP message plus or minus any remit-
tances, such as interest.

11.3. End-of-Month Products. Each NAF AO receives an end-of-month package which contains the
following products:
   11.3.1. CMIP Recap Summary. This is a further breakdown of the daily CMIP statement by NAFI,
   DOB, and type of transaction. This product can be used as an aid in balancing CMIP to the General
   Ledger.
   11.3.2. CMIP Missing Document Summaries. There are three types of missing document summa-
   ries. The deposit missing document summary shows missing documents by transaction type and by
   bank. The transfer and allocation missing document summary shows missing documents by the
   2-digit NAFI identifier. The check issue missing document summary shows missing documents by
   check issue type and check number.
   11.3.3. Outstanding Check Reports. Several outstanding check reports are included. Reports for
   general checks, foreign currency general checks, payroll checks, and foreign currency payroll checks
   are produced separately. All checks that have not been paid or processed as paid by the CMIP system,
   as of the last business day of a given month, are listed in numerical order. Only overseas bases receive
   reports for foreign currency transactions.
   11.3.4. ARA Capital/Construction Expenditures. The monthly report recaps activity on all
   projects by ARA account number and project number. It has the date of the transaction, document
   number reported, check number reported as issued, amount, and description for all accepted "CT"
   input. It shows any maintenance transactions input by HQ AFSVA/SVFB. Maintenance transactions
   are necessary when there are contract modifications, etc. The total remaining amount available for
   reimbursement by project is the amount shown in the last column. At the bottom of the report is a
46                                                                AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003


     grand total summary for the base. The NAF AO balances this report monthly to the individual project
     folders it maintains. The NAF AO immediately reports any discrepancies to HQ AFSVA/SVFB.

11.4. “Verification of Outstanding Check Reports. The NAF AO reviews the outstanding check
reports monthly and notifies HQ AFSVA/SVFB of any error in a check number. HQ AFSVA/SVFB then
takes corrective action. Checks of less than $150 can be voided after 120 days if all attempts to contact the
payee have been unsuccessful. Checks of $150 or more must remain outstanding for 1 year. It is not nec-
essary to place a stop payment on the checks written-off unless a replacement check is to be issued. How-
ever, if the check has been deposited or cashed before the cash void request has been made, the base will
be charged and the base needs to do a journal voucher to reverse the entry since the funds are due the
payee.”

11.5. End-of-Month CMIP Account Verification. The NAF AO must reconcile each NAFI CMIP
account monthly. Use AF Form 1736, NAF Cash Management and Investment Program Account
Verification, to reconcile CMIP to the General Ledger and Cash Control Summary. Explain each recon-
ciling item used. If JVs or dollar transfers are required, be sure to annotate the transaction date entered
into the General Ledger. When using AF Form 1736, follow the steps in Attachment 4 to complete the
form.

11.6. Adjustments of CMIP Accounts Due to Unreconciled Variances. While the NAF AOs recon-
cile the CMIP accounts to the General Ledger at least monthly, variances can occur that cannot be identi-
fied. When an unidentified variance occurs, send a message to HQ AFSVA/SVFB answering the
following questions.
    • What is the amount of unreconciled difference between the General Ledger (GLAC 101) and
        CMIP by NAFI at EOM?
     •   Is the variance amount constant? If so, how long has it been constant?
     •   Is the problem being researched?
     •   Have adjustments been requested from HQ AFSVA/SVFB that have not been accomplished? If
         so, give details.
     •   Have required general ledger adjustments been made?
     •   Is assistance required?
HQ AFSVA/SVFB will acknowledge receipt of the information and provide further instructions regarding
actions to be taken.

                            SAVINGS AND SEVERANCE ACCOUNTS

12.1. Programs. The SAV and SEV programs are another pooling of resources concept. SAV and SEV
accounts are similar to savings accounts. Although participation in SAV and SEV programs are entirely
separate from CMIP participation, nearly all SAV/SEV deposits and withdrawals are made from and to
CMIP accounts. Some NAFIs not eligible for CMIP use other procedures for SAV/SEV transactions.

12.2. SAV Participation. SAV participation is entirely voluntary. SAV accounts are established and
closed at the request of the base NAF AO. All NAFIs, except the MWR Fund, may have a SAV account.

12.3. SEV Participation. SEV participation is mandatory for overseas bases which employ foreign
nationals if there is a severance liability. A MAJCOM may also request that SEV participation be estab-
lished for CONUS bases as a part of base closure proceedings. The MAJCOM will request the accounts
by message to HQ AFSVA/SVFB.

12.4. Account Numbers. SAV and SEV account numbers are the same as those used for CMIP. Those
NAFIs not eligible for CMIP participation (see paragraph 1.3.) are given a 5-digit account number unique
to their SAV and SEV accounts.

12.5. Statements. HQ AFSVA/SVFB sends the NAF AO SAV and SEV statements at EOM by mes-
sage, with an information copy of the message sent to the parent MAJCOM.

12.6. End-of-Month Products. HQ AFSVA/SVFB includes a SAV Recap Summary and a SEV Recap
Summary in the EOM package sent to each NAF AO. These summaries are further breakdowns of the
monthly activity by NAFI, DOB, and type of transaction.

12.7. Payment of Interest. The AFFMF calculates and pays interest on SAV/SEV accounts monthly in
the same manner and at the same rate as used for the CMIP (see paragraph 3.3.). The interest earned for
the prior month is posted to the SAV and SEV accounts on the first business day of the current month.

12.8. Deposits. CMIP participants report SAV/SEV deposits by preparing an inter-NAFI dollar transfer
as shown in paragraph 6.3. Enter the same SAV or SEV account number in both the disbursing NAFI and
receiving NAFI data fields. Enter "SAV" in data positions 67-69 for savings deposits and "SEV" in data
positions 67-69 for severance deposits.

12.9. Withdrawals. Make SAV withdrawals by following the procedures in paragraph 12.8., except
data position 38 is negative. Request all SEV withdrawals by message, with an information copy to the
parent MAJCOM.

12.10. Minimum Balances, SAV and SEV Accounts. The balances of SAV and SEV accounts are
periodically reviewed by HQ AFSVA/SVFB and all remaining balances of less than $10.00 are with-
drawn and moved to the CMIP account.

12.11. Investments for Non-CMIP Participants. Individual bases and NAFIs which do not participate
in CMIP may request a SAV/SEV account number from HQ AFSVA/SVFB. SAV/SEV deposits are made
by issuing a check payable to the Air Force Financial Management Fund, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite
400, San Antonio TX 78216-4138. If the check is for deposit to more than one NAFI's account, a break-
down of that portion applicable to each NAFI and the SAV/SEV account numbers must accompany the
check.

12.12. MAJCOM Contributions. MAJCOMs who want to share in the funding of a NAFI's severance
liability may do so using CMIP interfund transfer capability. The MAJCOM accomplishes these transfers
by using cash transfer (CT) transactions. The NAF AO, in turn, transfers the funds to the appropriate
NAFI's SEV account.

            AUTOMATED DATA REPORTING AND SUBMISSION SYSTEM (ADRSS)

13.1. Data Systems. The ADRSS provides an interface between functional computer systems and
AUTODIN. The NAFMIS contains programs which automatically produce the payroll transactions for
the Consolidated Nonappropriated Fund Banking Report (RCS: HAF-MWR(D)7505) transmission. The
NAFMIS produces files called OVAP4P and OVAP4Y. When the Data Processing Center (DPC) runs the
outgoing (ADRSS/OUT) program against the OVAP4Y file, it transmits the payroll transactions for
CMIP directly to AFMWRAB without NAF AO intervention. The NAFSAMS also automatically pro-
duces CMIP records for daily reporting. As accounting technicians enter daily transactions into the gen-
eral ledger, the accounting system creates a file called BKMMDD.TXT (MM = Month, DD = day) for
transmission to HQ AFSVA/SVFBC. Corrections and additions to either the automatically generated
NAFMIS payroll report or the accounting system generated file can be made by the NAF AO. Prelimi-
nary actions by NAF AO personnel are necessary to ensure proper transmission of the files. There are
several ways to transmit the RCS: HAF-MWR(D)7505 report. The NAF AO can take these records to the
DPC monitor for transmission using the DPC computer system and ADRSS/OUT. Those bases having
access to DDN should transmit the report using the DDN transmission instructions in the NAF Account-
ing System User's Guide. Use of DDN allows the NAF AO to control the timing of the transmission and
eliminates a daily trip to have the DPC transmit the data.

13.2. Initiation Procedures. A control record is set up to tell ADRSS where to send the report. For
NAFSAMS, the routing information is programmatically produced. The accounting system includes a
program to produce the control record in the format detailed below. Control records only require chang-
ing when the DPC changes its requirements. The DPC ADRSS information is contained in AFMAN
171-378, Automated Data Processing Systems and Procedures. The DPC monitor should reference this
manual for ADRSS record information. Manual preparation of the control record may be necessary in
special circumstances. Prepare the information as follows for CMIP transmission only:

13.3. Resubmission and Recovery Procedures. Occasionally it may be necessary to resubmit one or
more transactions. Procedures for resubmission vary between a file originating on the NAFMIS payroll
system and a file originating on the accounting system.
     13.3.1. For resubmission of NAFMIS payroll CMIP records, request the DPC monitor to resubmit the
     file or transmit via DDN. Ensure the control record has an "R" placed in position 67.
     13.3.2. For the accounting system, copy the file to be resubmitted to a freshly formatted floppy disk.
     Use the personal computer (PC) CMIP program to update position 67 with an "R". Process the file
     through the DPC as a resubmitted file.
     13.3.3. Follow the procedures outlined in the accounting system User's Guide to make any adjust-
     ments to CMIP records.
AFMAN34-215 8 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                         51


13.4. Manual Reporting. If the accounting system is not operational for an extended period of time,
reporting is accomplished by the use of the Microcomputer Online/Offline Processing System (MOOPS).
MOOPS provides an eighty position free frame record. Create these records in the format provided in this
manual. When the accounting system becomes operational, the manually reported records must be
entered in the General Ledger, but do not transmit the file containing the CMIP transactions to AFM-
WRAB.

                      OPERATIONS UNDER EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

14.1. Emergency Notifications. The RMFC shall notify the MAJCOM/SVF and HQ AFSVA/SVF, by
the most expedient means, of the nature of the emergency conditions. The MAJCOM/SVF shall desig-
nate a support accounting office (and notify HQ AFSVA/SVF) to ensure the survival and recovery of
essential data files, the capability to provide essential support during the emergency conditions, and the
re-establishment of operations.

14.2. Disposition of Currency and Coin. If conditions require evacuation, disposal or destruction of
currencies or coins, or emergency turn-in of funds, overseas field commanders shall follow procedures as
specified in AFR 170-18, Operations Under Emergency Conditions. Transfer US currency and coins to
the nearest disbursing officer in exchange for a check drawn on the Department of Treasury. The check is
to be made payable to the Air Force Financial Management Fund and sent to HQ AFSVA/SVFB for
deposit; a brief explanation of the nature of the emergency will accompany the check. Transfer of local
currencies and coins may be made to the disbursing officer for protective custody using a safekeeping
receipt. However, disbursing officers will not be held accountable should the local currencies or coins be
lost or destroyed as a result of the existing emergency.

14.3. Blank Check Stocks and Facsimile Signature Plates. If conditions require evacuation, destroy
blank check stocks using DD Form 2661, Spoiled/Canceled Check Record, as the inventory list. Also
destroy all facsimile signature plates. Destruction of the facsimile signature plates is also annotated on
DD Form 2661. Send the completed DD Form 2661 (original) attesting to the destruction of the checks
and any facsimile signature plates to HQ AFSVA/SVFB.

EXPLANATION OF AMOUNTS ENTERED ON BANK VERSUS BASE VARIANCE REPORT


1. Section labeled Bank Statement:

     Line 1 shows total of deposits and credits posted by the field bank, current month.

     Line 2 shows total debit memos (this includes returned checks) posted by the field bank, current
   month, except for the last day's debit memos. NOTE: If the field bank posts any debit memos on the
   last business day of the month (last 2 business days for overseas bases) and HQ AFSVA/SVFB cannot
   identify that they have been reported, these debit memos are carried forward to be included with the
   debit memos on line 2 in the following month.

     Line 3 allows space to record any bank adjustments or corrections.

     Line 4 is the net total of deposits and other bank credits, less debit memos and dishonored checks
   posted by the bank and considered in the current reconciliation, plus or minus any bank adjustments
   on line 3.

2. Section labeled Base Reported:

     Line 1 shows the total (adjusted, if necessary, to account for in transit items) deposits reported and
   accepted as shown on the monthly deposit report (AURCMIPDPRP).

    Line 2 shows the total (adjusted, if necessary, to account for in transit items) dishonored checks and
   bank debit memos reported and accepted as shown on the monthly deposit report (AURCMIPDPRP).

    Line 3 is for any HQ AFSVA/SVFB adjustments (if applicable) requested by the base during the
   month.

     Line 4 is the net total of deposits, less debit memos and dishonored checks, reported and accepted,
   plus or minus any adjustments on line 3.

3. The net variance is the difference between what the bank posted and what the base reported. If the
amount on line 4 of the Base Reported section (i.e., Total Net Deposits Accepted) is greater than the
amount on line 4 of the Bank Statement section (i.e., Total Net Deposits Posted to Your Bank Statement),
the net result is a negative variance. However, if the amount on line 4 of the Bank Statement section is
greater than the amount on line 4 of the Base Reported section, the net result is a positive variance.

                EXPLANATION OF DATA TO BE REPORTED ON AF FORM 1736

Line 1. Enter the balance shown on the CMIP statement as of the last day of the month.

Line 2. Enter the net of 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, and 2f. These are transactions posted to the General Ledger,
but not yet recorded in CMIP. These reconciling items are used when a daily transmission during the
month is received after the last DOB for the month.

Line 3. Enter the net of 3a, 3b, and 3c. These lines are to record items which require HQ AFSVA/SVFB
correction. This includes check variances to be reversed and deposit validation items which will "wash"
in the following month.

Line 4. Enter the net of 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d. These lines are to record rejected transactions by type. Use
these lines for entries recorded to cash in bank in the General Ledger and reported, but rejected and not
updated on CMIP.

Line 5. Enter the total of line 1, plus or minus the total of lines 2, 3, and 4. This will be the adjusted CMIP
balance.

Line 6. Enter cash control summary balance.

Line 7. Enter General Ledger GLAC 101 balance.

Lines 5, 6, and 7 must agree. All reconciling items are shown as an attachment to the Form and are iden-
tified by amount, document number, date, cause, and the method and date of correction.

IC 03-01 TO AFMAN 34-215, PROCEDURES FOR THE CASH MANAGEMENT AND INVEST-
                               MENT PROGRAM


8 SEPTEMBER 2003


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This revision incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2003-01. This interim change, (IC) 03-01, provides guid-
ance for the Procedures for Cash Management and Investment Program on Air Force Installations. Para-
graph 5.3., the sentence that reads, “Two authorized signatories must sign all checks of $50,000 or more.
The concentration bank and the overseas MBFs will return checks of $50,000 or more which do not bear
two signatories to the vendor unpaid,” is deleted. Paragraph 11.4. is changed to read “Verification of Out-
standing Check Reports. The NAF AO reviews the outstanding check reports monthly and notifies HQ
AFSVA/SVFB of any error in a check number. HQ AFSVA/SVFB then takes corrective action. Checks of
less than $150 can be voided after 120 days if all attempts to contact the payee have been unsuccessful.
Checks of $150 or more must remain outstanding for 1 year. It is not necessary to place a stop payment on
the checks written-off unless a replacement check is to be issued. However, if the check has been depos-
ited or cashed before the cash void request has been made, the base will be charged and the base needs to
do a journal voucher to reverse the entry since the funds are due the payee.”


5.3.Signature Requirements on Checks. Delete Two authorized signatories must sign all checks of
$50,000 or more. The concentration bank and the overseas MBFs will return checks of $50,000 or more
which do not bear two signatories to the vendor unpaid.”


11.4.“Verification of Outstanding Check Reports. The NAF AO reviews the outstanding check reports
monthly and notifies HQ AFSVA/SVFB of any error in a check number. HQ AFSVA/SVFB then takes
corrective action. Checks of less than $150 can be voided after 120 days if all attempts to contact the
payee have been unsuccessful. Checks of $150 or more must remain outstanding for 1 year. It is not nec-
essary to place a stop payment on the checks written-off unless a replacement check is to be issued. How-
ever, if the check has been deposited or cashed before the cash void request has been made, the base will
be charged and the base needs to do a journal voucher to reverse the entry since the funds are due the
payee.”
