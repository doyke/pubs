This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. It
establishes procedures for, and applies to those personnel in Operations, Maintenance and Logistics con-
cerned with the planning, execution and documentation of functional check flights (FCF), operational
check flights (OCF) and high speed taxi checks (HST) for the 442d Fighter Wing (442 FW). This instruc-
tion implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management, Technical Order (T.O.) 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flights and
Maintenance Operational Checks, and T.O. 1A-10A-5, Basic Weight Checklist and Loading Data. It
applies to all 442 FW personnel.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


1. General:
   1.1. The 442d Maintenance Group Quality Assurance (442 MXG/MGQ) is responsible for the man-
   agement and administration of the unit FCF program. This office is the single point of contact (POC)
   for scheduling and completion of all FCFs, OCFs and HSTs. The Chief of Quality Assurance (QA)
   will assign this duty within MGQ.

2. Procedures:
   2.1. As specified in the T.O. 1A-10A-6, Scheduled Inspection and Maintenance Requirements.
   2.2. At the discretion of the Maintenance Group Commander (442 MXG/CC) or Operations Group
   Commander (442 OG/CC).
   2.3. 442 MXG/MGQ will serve as the focal point for FCFs required on transit A-10/OA10 aircraft.
2                                                                        442FWI21-102 26 JULY 2006


3. Pilot Requirements:
    3.1. Normally, the number of FCF pilots will not exceed four. The 442 OG/CC will:
       3.1.1. Select pilots to perform FCF duties, and list them on a letter of authorization. OCFs will be
       flown by an FCF pilot, but if one is not available with OG/CC approval an instructor pilot may fly
       the OCF.
    3.2. The check-out program for all FCF pilots will consist of:
       3.2.1. A comprehensive briefing by the Fighter Training Officer (FTO) on the following:
           3.2.1.1. AFI 21-101.
           3.2.1.2. 442d Fighter Wing Instruction 21-102.
           3.2.1.3. T.O. 1-1-300.
           3.2.1.4. T.O. 1A-10A-6.
           3.2.1.5. T.O. 1A-10A-6CF-1, Functional Check Flight Procedures Manual.
       3.2.2. An academic briefing by a current FCF pilot.
       3.2.3. A cockpit procedures training (CPT) session using the entire FCF checklist.
       3.2.4. Briefing from MXG/MGQ on FCF duties.
    3.3. A six (6) month currency will be established to ensure pilot knowledge of all FCF procedures.
    Any pilot, whose currency expires, will accomplish a simulator FCF profile in the CPT, prior to flying
    an FCF. The need for a FCF may occur during a deployment, or at a deployed location. If qualified
    MGQ personnel and/or a qualified FCF pilot are not available to comply with the procedures estab-
    lished in this supplement, then the deployment mission commander will ensure the following:
    3.4. On-site personnel will communicate with qualified MGQ personnel to ensure that all regulatory
    requirements have been met, prior to an FCF being flown.
    3.5. The DETCO will select the most highly qualified pilot and coordinate this selection with the
    home station OG/CC or Operations Group Deputy Commander (OG/ CD.) Before flight, ensure this
    pilot communicates with a qualified FCF pilot concerning all requirements of the FCF and the associ-
    ated documentation.

4. FCF Procedures and Responsibilities:
