                          AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION

                                            Chapter 1

                       USAF PERSONNEL PARACHUTE PROGRAM

1.1. Purpose. This instruction establishes procedures governing the authority and
administration of the USAF Personnel Parachute Program (PPP), parachute qualifications and
requirements, and procedures applicable to premeditated personnel parachuting.
1.2. Objectives. The requirement for the USAF PPP originates with DoD Directive 5100.1. The
directive tasks the Department of the Air Force with “preparation of the air and space forces
necessary for the effective prosecution of war and military operations short of war” and identifies
Air Force functions. A primary function of the Air Force is “to develop, in coordination with the
other services, doctrines, procedures, and equipment employed by Air Force forces in airborne
operations.” The Army coordinates and develops airborne doctrine, procedures, and equipment
on behalf of itself and the Marine Corps. While this instruction draws extensively upon the
combat, operational, and training base of the joint services, the nature of USAF parachuting also
requires tactics, techniques, procedures, and equipment not addressed in sister service
publications. Objectives for the USAF PPP are divided into operational, functional, and
management categories.
     1.2.1. The operational objective of the USAF PPP is to tactically employ forces during war
     and military operations short of war.
     1.2.2. The following are functional objectives of the USAF PPP:
        1.2.2.1. Test, evaluate, and certify systems and equipment that contribute to improved
        survivability during either premeditated or emergency parachute egress.
        1.2.2.2. Instruct and demonstrate proper premeditated and emergency egress procedures
        to improve survivability, develop confidence, and establish an airmanship foundation.
        1.2.2.3. Conduct aviation support to public and/or military events to showcase military
        preparedness, demonstrate capabilities, promote good community and international
        relations, support USAF recruiting and retention efforts, and render military honors in
        accordance with AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures.
     1.2.3. Management objectives of the USAF PPP include:
        1.2.3.1. Provide standards for training, qualification, and currency of USAF parachutists.
        1.2.3.2. Approve parachuting equipment and maintain a central equipment listing.
        1.2.3.3. Increase mission effectiveness and safety.
        1.2.3.4. Ensure compliance with DoD and USAF activity, mishap, incident, and
        malfunction reporting requirements.
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             9


1.3. General. Compliance with this instruction requires mature risk evaluation and mitigation
by subordinate organizations. Use AFTTP (I) 3-2.34, Risk Management, and AFI 90-901,
Operational Risk Management, as guidance for the risk management processes.
   1.3.1. The USAF PPP does not govern cargo equipment parachute operations, cargo
   equipment parachute rigging, or non-premeditated parachute equipment, including
   emergency bailout parachutes and ejection seats. Emergency parachutes are covered by the
   appropriate technical order or manual. Joint airdrop equipment procedures are prescribed by
   AFJI 13-210(I), Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction/Incident Investigations, and
   Activity Reporting. For information on drop zones, refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and
   Landing Zone Operations.
   1.3.2. The term major military command (MMC) is used throughout this publication as an
   umbrella term for the Air National Guard, field operating agencies, HQ USAF direct
   reporting units, and major commands to include Air Force Reserve Command. The Office of
   Personnel Management (Human Resources Collection Directive-5) defines a MMC as a
   military organization next below the Departments of the Army, Air Force, or Navy and
   headed by a flag or general officer who reports directly to the agency headquarters. For
   purposes of simplicity and applicability, this instruction categorizes the ANG and those
   FOAs and DRUs not headed by general officers as MMCs.
   1.3.3. All USAF parachuting operations will be conducted in accordance with published
   guidance, utilizing equipment approved through the process described in Chapter 4.
       1.3.4. (Added-ACC) ACC units should use AFMAN 11-420 as a guide to establish an
       Operational Risk Management (ORM) program.
1.4. References. During unilateral operations, use this instruction in conjunction with
AFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220, Static Line Parachuting Techniques and Training, AFMAN
11-411(I)/FM 3-05.211, Special Forces Military Free-Fall Operations, AFTTP 3-1.8, Tactical
Employment—GUARDIAN ANGEL and Special Tactics Forces, and AFTTP 3-3.8, Combat
Fundamentals—GUARDIAN ANGEL and Special Tactics Forces (throughout this instruction
AFTTPs 3-1.8 and 3-3.8 are not applicable for other than GUARDIAN ANGEL and Special
Tactics personnel). These publications constitute the primary guidance for static-line and military
free fall parachuting. During parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, use this
instruction in conjunction with applicable joint publications such as USSOCOM Manual 350-3,
Training Airborne Operations (Parachuting). Additional parachuting references can be found at
Attachment 1 and on the Air Force portal in the “AF Personnel Parachute Program” community
of practice: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-TO-00-
2.
1.5. Waiver Authority. HQ USAF/A3O-AS is the waiver authority for this instruction, unless
specifically noted in this paragraph or in the text of this instruction. HQ USAF waivers are valid
for only the period of time required to correct the waiver condition, not to exceed 24 months
from the date of approval. MMC commanders have authority and responsibility for parachuting
operations under their control. During combat operations, contingencies, and inspections, waiver
authority for operational procedures specified in this instruction and associated inter-service
references is the Air Component A3, the Joint Special Operations Task Force J3, the MMC/A3,
or their designated representatives, as applicable. Waiver authority for operational procedures
during exercises and training is the MMC/A3, or designated representative, except where

                                           Chapter 3

                                     ADMINISTRATION

3.1. Authority. This instruction provides USAF guidance for compliance with the legislative
and departmental directives that govern parachute operations. It directs USAF PPP
administration, characterizes in-flight duties performed by parachutists, and cooperates with the
references listed in paragraph 1.4 to assure the legality, safety, and effectiveness of mission
segments that involve premeditated personnel parachuting.
3.2. Applicable to Whom. This instruction applies to all active duty Air Force, AF Reserve,
ANG, and Department of the Air Force civilian personnel involved in deliberate personnel
parachute missions, training, support, or administration. Contract employees are required to
comply with the provisions of their contracts. When the government requires that contractors
comply with this instruction, cite applicable portions in the statement of work.
3.3. Validating Permanent Parachute Positions. A parachute position is a designated unit
manning document (UMD) or joint manning document (JMD) position that has been approved
by HQ USAF and that requires the member to perform deliberate, regular, and recurring
parachute duty as a part of the organization’s mission. These billets are typically referred to as
“J” coded positions. Since positions are validated on the basis of recurring requirements, the
intent of a “J” coded position is that the member will maintain standards, qualification, and
currency. Failure to maintain active parachute status typically precludes service in the position.
   3.3.1. Requests for parachute positions consist of the following:
       3.3.1.1. AF Form 4322, Active Parachutist Justification. The justification must be
       consistent with the PPP objectives in paragraph 1.2 and specifically address each
       position’s operational requirement and impact on the organization’s ability to prosecute
       its mission. The MMC, in exercising its requirement vetting function, will consider
       factors such as SOPs, TTPs, equipment, training, medical support, flying hours, and
       funding. Prior to submitting requests, MMCs and subordinate organizations should also
       consider the opportunity cost of coding a position (e.g. what the position won’t be able to
       accomplish in light of the new parachute qualification, training, and currency
       requirements).
       3.3.1.2. Request Letter. Include a request for parachute position validation from the
       MMC/A3 to HQ USAF. Requests concerning USAF positions at joint organizations
       should substitute the MMC/A3 for the joint command’s operations officer, even if this is
       not a USAF officer. While MMC functional area managers and PPPMs are typically
       involved in requests, internal coordination and request format are at the requesting
       organization’s discretion. Where appropriate, MMC/A3s and joint command operations
       officers may delegate release authority for requests concerning billets at O-5 grades and
       below to the first O-6 in the MMC PPPM’s chain of command or the Air Force Element
       Commander at the joint organization, respectively.
   3.3.2. Forward parachute position requests to the USAF PPPM electronically at
   a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil or to HQ USAF/A3O-AS, 1480 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1480. The USAF PPPM will accomplish coordination at HQ USAF
   on behalf of the MMC.
 18                                            AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


       3.3.2.1. For requests concerning billets at grade O-6 or below, the USAF PPPM will
       coordinate requests with the affected AF CFM(s), HQ USAF/A3O-AT, and HQ
       USAF/A1M when appropriate. AF CFMs generally consider factors pertaining to how
       the permanent billet will fit into the career field plan as a whole, the pool of available
       volunteers for parachute duty, modifications to training quotas, and operational
       integration. HQ USAF/A3O-AT will review for fiscal supportability, and HQ
       USAF/A3O-AS accomplishes requirement vetting and serves as the approval authority
       for position validation.
       3.3.2.2. The Chief of Staff designates general officer parachute positions in the same
       fashion that applies to other flying positions. The USAF PPPM will coordinate requests
       or revisions to general officer parachute positions with AF/DPG, AF/A3/5, AF/A1,
       HAF/CX, AF/CVA, and AF/CV. AF/CC is the approval authority in these cases.
   3.3.3. MMCs and comparable organizations will maintain approved parachute position
   validation packages on file for accountability and to facilitate periodic review of
   authorizations by HQ USAF/A3O-AS. The USAF PPPM typically conducts this review
   every two years.
   3.3.4. The UMD or JMD reflects the number of members authorized parachute duty in a
   given organization, by making reference to either a “J” coded position or a jump-inherent
   specialty. Double billeting will only occur when assigned to a valid student authorization or
   approved by HQ USAF IAW AFI 11-402. Forward double billeting requests to the USAF
   PPPM according to paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.
       3.3.5. (Added-ACC) Approval authority is delegated to HQ ACC/A3J.
3.4. Validating Permanent Parachute Positions Using Jump-Inherent Duty AFSCs. Certain
Duty AFSCs (DAFSCs) require the performance of deliberate, regular, and recurring parachute
duty to accomplish assigned missions. These DAFSCs are central to the ability of the USAF PPP
to carry out its assigned functions, and they provide a pool of qualified and current mission
parachutists independent of the manpower positions in which they serve. In these cases,
parachute duty is considered to be inherent to the DAFSC, and since positions are validated on
the basis of recurring requirements, the intent of a “J” inherent position is that the member will
maintain standards, qualification, and currency. Legitimate possession of a jump-inherent
DAFSC constitutes a valid parachute position and exempts its holder from the process described
in paragraph 3.3.
       3.4.1. DELETED.
       3.4.1. (ACC) Add 13LXX.
   3.4.2. Permanent disqualification from parachute duty precludes service in a jump-inherent
   DAFSC. Exceptions to policy are authorized by HQ USAF/A3O.
   3.4.3. The exemption from position validation for jump-inherent DAFSCs does not extend
   beyond the DAFSC (i.e. secondary AFSC, tertiary AFSC, etc.).
   3.4.4. While 1T0XX is not considered a “J” inherent DAFSC, members who hold the
   1T0XX DAFSC require qualification to accomplish assigned USAF PPP objectives and are
   authorized to attend qualification training independent of the positions in which they
   currently serve. Members maintain active parachutist status, including currency, only when
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         19


   assigned to “J” coded positions or temporary parachute positions per paragraphs 3.3 and
   3.5. The 1T0XX specialty is exempt from the requirements contained in paragraph 3.5.2.
3.5. Temporary Parachute Positions. Temporary parachute positions allow commanders to
place qualified members on active parachute status in the absence of validated parachute
positions. They are used to permit MMCs to respond to short-duration mission requirements or
to allow members of jump-inherent career fields who are temporarily serving in other DAFSCs
to maintain proficiency when serving outside of parachute positions. Approved temporary
positions convey active status and parachute pay entitlement. MMC/A3s may approve temporary
positions amounting to 365 days or less (12 or less months parachute pay) in a 24-month period.
Requests concerning USAF positions at joint organizations should substitute the MMC/A3 for
the joint command’s operations officer, even if this is not a USAF officer. The following
requirements apply to temporary parachute positions:
   3.5. (ACC) Temporary Parachute Positions. Approval authority for temporary jump
   status for all ACC personnel is delegated to HQ ACC/A3J.
   3.5.1. Members filling temporary parachute positions are qualified and maintain currency
   IAW Part 2.
   3.5.2. Members must have completed at least 30 months on active parachute status to be
   eligible for temporary parachute positions.
   3.5.3. Before permitting members to participate in temporary parachuting, MMC/A3s, or
   joint equivalents, will evaluate the following:
       3.5.3.1. Interest of the service compared to that of the member.
       3.5.3.2. Impact on operational resources.
       3.5.3.3. Cost and impact on logistics.
       3.5.3.4. Likelihood that the member will return to a permanent parachute position.
       3.5.3.5. Costs of retraining.
       3.5.3.6. Availability of a communication process for parachuting and safety information.
   3.5.4. Temporary parachute positions are subject to considerable scrutiny. Requests for
   temporary parachute positions within the approval authority of the MMC/A3, or joint
   equivalent, follow the procedure in paragraph 3.3.1 except they must also include a copy of
   applicable qualification course certificates and a copy of the member’s current ARMS
   Individual Data Summary (IDS) and Jump History Report (JHR). A sample request letter can
   be found at Attachment 3. MMCs must coordinate parachute pay funding approval through
   HQ USAF/A3O-AT and forward a copy of the approved documentation to the USAF PPPM
   electronically at a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil or to HQ USAF/A3O-AS, 1480 Air
   Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480. MMCs will maintain a copy of the approved
   package on file. Requests that affect general officers must be coordinated through HQ
   USAF/DPG.
   3.5.5. For requests outside the approval authority of the MMC/A3, or joint equivalent, (i.e.
   those for more than 365 days in a 24-month period) staff the package to HQ USAF using the
   procedure in paragraph 3.3.2. The package consists of the documentation in paragraphs
   3.3.1 and 3.5.4.
 20                                           AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


3.6. Placing Members on Active Parachute Status. Initiate aeronautical orders (AOs) IAW
AFI 11-401 to place an individual on active parachute status only when required to fill a valid
parachute position as defined in paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 above, when in initial training leading
to such a position, for student authorizations at USAF Academy parachute programs, or when
filling an approved temporary parachute position according to paragraph 3.5. Do not assign
members to active parachute status unless a member meets the standards and qualification
criteria in Chapter 6 or is in initial training leading to that qualification. Parachutist
qualifications and status are awarded based on mission requirements and will not be used as part
of an incentive or recognition program. Active parachute status is commonly referred to as
“jump” status.
   3.6. (ACC) Placing Members on Active Parachute Status. Add AFI 11-421.
   3.6.1. The following authorities may enter or withdraw members from active parachute
   status:
       3.6.1.1. HQ USAF/A3O-AS.
       3.6.1.2. MMC commanders, A3s, or joint equivalents.
       3.6.1.3. Commanders of organizations with validated parachute positions on the UMD or
       JMD, through the HARM office responsible for maintaining jump records.
   3.6.2. Aviation Service Codes (ASCs) are used to indicate flying status and incentive pay
   entitlement. ASCs pertaining to parachuting are only authorized for members qualified per
   Chapter 6 who are required to fill validated parachute positions as defined in paragraphs
   3.3 and 3.4, when in initial training leading to such positions as explained in AFI 11-401, or
   when filling approved temporary parachute positions according to paragraph 3.5. Per public
   law, parachute duty pay is a component of HDIP. It is calculated at one of two rates based on
   the category of active service: High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or static-line (S/L).
3.7. Documentation.
   3.7.1. USAF personnel must be on valid AOs authorizing active parachute status IAW AFIs
   11-401, 11-402, 11-421, and this instruction before engaging in military parachute
   operations, to include initial parachutist training.
   3.7.2. Parachutists are subject to the provisions of AFIs 11-403 and 48-123V3. Document
   training and examinations on AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, and
   AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty,
   respectively. Members may also be subject to more restrictive performance standards
   required by joint, MMC, and unit guidance.
   3.7.3. ARMS is the primary mechanism for documenting and maintaining parachute
   qualifications, ratings, activity, and currency data. Members are encouraged to maintain
   personal parachute records. Training and currency documentation is also subject to Career
   Field Education and Training Plans (CFETPs), MMC guidance, and joint publications.
   Notify the Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office of the member’s parachute
   duty requirement (HALO, S/L, or both) so accurate AOs can be published and the HDIP
   entitlement rate can be determined. Properly completed AOs, on-the-job training (OJT)
   records, and currency requirements constitute the commander’s designation for parachute
   duty. The detailed contents of the Jump Record Folder (JRF) can be found in AFI 11-421.
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              21


   The HARM office is the focal point for questions concerning entitlements and JRF contents.
   The individual JRF is the permanent repository for: AOs, Military Pay Orders (MPOs), data
   submitted through AF Forms 4323, ARMS Multi-Crew Jump Record, AF Forms 922,
   Individual Jump Record, AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification
   Worksheet, as well as source documentation affecting a parachutist’s status and qualifications
   (AF Forms 702 and 1042, formal training certificates, etc.). Members submit AF Forms 4323
   and 922 per Attachment 2. ARMS is capable of generating the IDS, JHR, and Individual
   Jump Record (IJR). The HARM office is responsible for validating HDIP entitlement and
   managing AOs, MPOs, and JRFs IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, 11-421, and this instruction. In
   the case of an AFI conflict, this instruction takes precedence for all parachute-related issues.
      3.7.3. (ACC) Parachutists, not assigned to Guardian Angel squadrons, will maintain an
      Informal Jump Record Folder (JRF) which will contain copies of all information
      indicative of the training and qualification of the parachutist and will be taken TDY etc.
      This record is in addition to the Permanent JRF maintained by the Host Aviation
      Resource Management (HARM) office. Upon completion of parachutist duty, the
      Informal JRF will be updated and returned to the individual who will ensure the
      permanent JRF is also updated with all applicable information. Parachutist training
      records will be kept in this folder and contain the following documentation:
          3.7.3.1. (Added-ACC) AF Form 797, Parachutists Job Qualification Standard
          Continuation/Command JQS.
          3.7.3.2. (Added-ACC) AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring
          Training.
          3.7.3.3. (Added-ACC) Parachutist Evaluation Record.
          3.7.3.4. (Added-ACC) Qualification Documentation, Letters of Appointment and
          Miscellaneous correspondence.
3.8. Preparing Aeronautical Orders. For AOs that enter parachutists into active parachute
status, submit requests to the HARM office IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, and this instruction.
   3.8.1. Commanders must certify eligibility for parachute duty. Certification includes
   requirement for active parachute status as described in paragraph 3.6 and review of past
   parachute duty or training to preclude performance issues and ensure member has not been
   previously disqualified.
   3.8.2. Requests include, at minimum, the member’s name, grade, social security number,
   unit of assignment, DAFSC, UMD or JMD position number, date assigned to the unit, formal
   qualification certificate or letter of completion, expiration date of the current flying class III
   physical that clears the member for parachute duty, and type of parachute duty required
   (HALO, S/L, or both).
      3.8.2.1. For previously qualified parachutists, include the dates assigned to the
      authorized parachute position.
      3.8.2.2. For members attending initial parachute training, include the class start date and
      location.
      3.8.2.3. For temporary parachute positions, include the effective duration and a copy of
      the approval paperwork.
 22                                           AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


   3.8.3. Policy governing effective dates, durations, and procedures for AOs that authorize
   active parachute status is contained in AFI 11-401.
   3.8.4. Commanders submit requests to publish parachute rating AOs to the HARM office
   IAW this instruction and AFI 11-402.
3.9. Removing Members from Active Parachute Status. Officers vested with the ability to
place members on active parachute status per paragraph 3.6 will remove members from active
status when no longer serving in a position approved through paragraphs 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5, when
the requirement for that position no longer exists, upon completion of USAF Academy parachute
programs, or when suspended or disqualified for reasons listed in AFI 11-402 and this
instruction.
   3.9.1. Notify the HARM office when a member changes parachute duty type (HALO, S/L,
   or both) or is removed from active parachute status entirely. Since termination of active
   parachute status results in non-eligibility for parachute duty pay, provide the member as
   much notice as possible. Parachutists suspended or disqualified for cause do not require
   advance notification.
   3.9.2. Commanders may remove any parachutist from status for cause, for lack of
   qualification, or for failure to meet standards per Chapter 6. Use the same reasons and
   procedures identified for aircrew members in AFI 11-402 to suspend and disqualify
   parachutists.
   3.9.3. Supersede AOs IAW AFI 11-401 and 11-402.
   3.9.4. Parachutists may be moved to inactive status for reasons articulated in AFI 11-401
   (e.g. ASC 9J when filling non-parachute positions or ASC 9L for non-parachute courses of
   instruction lasting 180 days or longer).
3.10. Permanent Disqualification Actions. Members are permanently disqualified when they
fail to satisfactorily perform parachute duty, when they voluntarily terminate parachute duty, or
at the commander’s recommendation. Disqualification ASCs are governed by AFI 11-401. While
final action is pending, a commander may suspend a parachutist for no more than 180 days after
which MMC/A3 approval is required; assign ASC 04 in these cases. Include a copy of the
suspension AO with the commander’s request for permanent disqualification. If not suspended,
the member will continue to perform parachute duties.
3.11. Non-permanent Disqualification Actions. Disqualify parachutists in the same manner as
non-rated aircrew members and IAW AFI 11-402. Typical non-permanent actions include failure
to maintain medical fitness and humanitarian disqualifications.
3.12. Parachute Duty Requalification. Parachutists who are disqualified for non-permanent
reasons listed in AFI 11-402 may be requalified upon removal of the impediment to parachuting.
Approval is based on the needs of the Air Force. If no longer assigned to a parachute position,
the member must submit a request according to AFI 36-2110, Assignments. Process
requalification requests IAW AFI 11-402.
3.13. Parachutist Code Identifiers. Assign the “J” prefix to a member’s AFSC upon
completion of qualification requirements in Chapter 6. The “J” prefix is kept on the primary,
secondary, or additional AFSC as long as the member remains qualified, even though the
requirement for parachute jump duties may end. When the parachutist also holds a “C” prefix
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         23


(commander), a “B” prefix (operations officer), an aircrew “X”, “K”, or “Q” prefix, or other
qualification/position prefix, place a statement on the AO indicating that the member occupies a
“J” coded position. DAFSCs that are jump-inherent do not require a “J” prefix.
3.14. Funding for Parachute Duty Pay. The Air Force programs and budgets based on
validated parachute positions. The total number of validated parachute positions determines the
incentive pay allocation. HQ USAF/A3O-AT is responsible for the flight/parachute pay budget
and manages this program IAW AFI 11-402. HQ USAF will periodically revalidate parachute
positions.

                                          Chapter 4

                          ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT

4.1. Equipment Acquisition. This chapter constitutes the primary equipment acquisition and
sustainment guidance for parachutists operating under the USAF PPP. During joint parachute
operations conducted under a joint commander, comply with applicable guidance.
   4.1.1. Requirement Generation. Each MMC establishes operational requirements for
   parachute systems and equipment in accordance with AFI 10-601, Capabilities Based
   Requirements Development, and applicable acquisition and test guidance as described in AFI
   63-101, Operations of Capabilities Based Acquisition System, AFI 99-103, Capabilities
   Based Test and Evaluation, and DoD 5000-series publications.
   4.1.2. Requirement Configuration and Validation. When MMCs generate new category I/II
   requirements (as defined in paragraph 4.4), they must first validate the requirement through
   the USAF PPPM prior to government obligation to preclude dissipating personnel and
   financial resources on pre-decisional items. During this initial analysis the USAF PPPM
   determines whether a MMC’s requirement will meet the PPP Executive Committee or
   whether it will bypass the committee and proceed directly to equipment test and evaluation as
   described in paragraph 4.2. When the USAF PPPM coordinates a requirement through the
   committee, the purpose is typically to determine if the same need exists in other
   organizations, to ascertain the appropriate amount of USAF and/or sister service
   standardization, or to promote safety and affordability. When an urgent operational need
   exists for a requirement that would normally be coordinated through the committee, HQ
   USAF/A3O-AS may configure and validate the requirement when convening the committee
   would unacceptably delay fielding. The composition of the committee is described in
   paragraph 2.2.7. When executing its configuration and validation functions, the committee
   will incorporate subject matter experts when required, including parachutists, Aircrew Flight
   Equipment specialists, logistics managers, and supply technicians. Requirement
   configuration and validation will consider items that meet formal criteria directed through
   Department of Transportation Technical Standard Order 23, the American National
   Standards Institute, a DoD operational test and evaluation process, or another DoD or service
   approved process. Requirements not covered by a TO/TM may require special consideration
   prior to being fielded for use. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions for category I/II
   requirements will be considered, but may not be fielded until a minimum introductory period,
   consisting of active civil use, has elapsed. COTS introductory period durations are typically
   12 months, however the USAF PPPM may be more or less restrictive. The end result of the
   configuration and validation process is a validated requirement that enters the testing,
   evaluation, and certification process.
   4.1.3. Acquisition Management. Unless equipment will be obtained through local purchase,
   as validated by the USAF PPPM, the committee will request that SAF/AQ identify program
   management responsibility. The Program Manager will develop an acquisition strategy and
   coordinate funding responsibilities pertaining to multiple MMCs, if applicable.
4.2. Equipment Test and Evaluation. AFMC is the USAF OPR for personnel parachute
systems and equipment developmental test and evaluation (DT&E). Designated MMC
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         25


operational test organizations are responsible for operational test and evaluation (OT&E) of
personnel parachute systems and equipment.
4.3. Equipment Certification. The Test Parachutist Program (TPP) is the USAF OPR for the
certification of personnel parachute systems and equipment. Send requests for TPP action
through the MMC PPPM to 418 FLTS/DOOP at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB,
CA, DSN 525-4282. Courtesy copy the USAF PPPM at a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.
   4.3. (ACC) Equipment Certification. The 88th Test and Evaluation Squadron is the
   USAF OPR for the certification of all Guardian Angel Weapons System (GAWS) equipment,
   belonging to categories II and III. Send requests for GAWS action through the MMC PPPM
   to ACC/A3J at Headquarters Air Combat Command, Langley AFB, VA 23665. Courtesy
   copy the USAF PPPM at a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.
   4.3.1. Items belonging to categories I and II, as detailed in paragraph 4.4, will undergo a
   design safety assessment and test and evaluation, as appropriate. Replacement items will be
   reviewed by the TPP to assure they replicate the original item as it pertains to function and
   safety. After reviewing an item, the TPP will forward all test results, design studies,
   documentation and a usage recommendation to the requesting MMC and to HQ USAF/A3O-
   AS. HQ USAF/A3O-AS will make a usage approval decision and authorize modification of
   the USAF Approved for Use List (AUL).
   4.3.2. Items belonging to category III, as described in paragraph 4.4, are part of a
   parachutist’s individual equipment for which operational needs will be the primary selection
   criteria. When an item will be employed in an exposed configuration (i.e. could possibly
   interfere with the operation of the parachute system) or could pose a safety hazard to
   parachutists, it must be certified by the TPP and approved by the MMC on its category III
   AUL. In order to enhance safety, MMCs will prescribe item jump configuration or mounting
   guidelines as required. Approval must be based upon sound, experienced judgment that the
   equipment both enhances mission performance and does not pose a safety hazard to the
   parachutist. There is no requirement to list unexposed items that do not pose a safety hazard
   on the AUL.
4.4. Equipment Approval. Parachute systems and equipment are authorized via the USAF
AUL, which is approved by HQ USAF/A3O-AS and maintained on the Air Force portal in the
“AF        Personnel         Parachute      Program”        community        of      practice:
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-TO-00-32/.
Approval of items in category III is delegated to MMCs, thus the HQ USAF AUL does not
include category III items. Instead, MMCs are responsible for maintaining command category III
lists and will post an updated copy in the “AF Personnel Parachute Program” community of
practice. MMCs approve category III items per paragraph 4.3.2. The AUL format is divided
into three equipment categories, and will include at a minimum: item description, NSN, part
number, model number/manufacturer, and authorized users.
   4.4.1. Category I—parachutist aircrew flight equipment that is worn by, or otherwise
   attached to the parachutist. Category I includes parachute canopies, parachute components,
   harnesses, containers, oxygen breathing equipment, helmets, automatic activation
   devices/electronic automatic activation devices, and altimeters.
 26                                            AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


   4.4.2. Category II—non-aircrew flight equipment that is potentially hazardous to the
   parachutist. Category II includes items such as life vests/preservers, equipment, equipment
   components, equipment bags, strobe lights, and public relations devices used during
   parachuting demonstrations.
   4.4.3. Category III—non-aircrew flight equipment (individual equipment) typically worn
   exposed or used in premeditated parachuting which: 1) is available in a broad selection of
   acceptable options, 2) does not create a life-threatening hazard to a reasonably prudent
   parachutist, and 3) is carried by USAF parachutists in support of a mission requirement.
4.5. Equipment Sustainment. AFMC is responsible for serving as the single focal point for
category I/II equipment sustainment and modernization efforts. The function will serve as the
primary interface with parachute systems and equipment manufacturers and is responsible for the
following functions:
   4.5.1. Monitor the readiness and reliability of the existing parachute fleet through such
   mechanisms as periodic reevaluations and activity, incident, and malfunction reporting.
   4.5.2. Disseminate manufacturers’ safety notices and information bulletins in a timely
   fashion to HQ USAF/A3O-AS at a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. HQ USAF/A3O-AS
   will promulgate pertinent information to the USAF parachute community.
   4.5.3. Maintain close interaction with comparable sister service functions so as to benefit
   from like efforts and disseminate pertinent findings.
   4.5.4. Maintain close ties with the acquisition manager, if this is a separate function.

                                            Chapter 5

         ACTIVITY, MISHAP, INCIDENT, AND MALFUNCTION REPORTING

5.1. DoD Reporting Requirements. Ensuring compliance with DoD activity, incident, and
malfunction reporting is a management objective of the USAF PPP. AFJI 13-210(I), Joint
Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction/Incident Investigations, and Activity Reporting,
prescribes policy and identifies procedures and forms used in preparing joint airdrop inspection
records, airdrop malfunction investigations, and airdrop activity reports. All USAF organizations
conducting premeditated parachute operations must have AFJI 13-210(I) on hand, and all
malfunction officers and jumpmasters must be familiar with its contents. Where AFJI 13-210(I)
and this instruction conflict, this instruction takes precedence. MMCs may supplement reporting
requirements, provided they adhere to the provisions of this chapter fully.
5.2. Activity Reporting. Activity reporting is a MMC responsibility. The HARM office can
typically provide the requisite data to populate DD Form 1748-3, Joint Monthly Airdrop
Summary Report, including total number of jumps by canopy and aircraft type. MMCs will
submit the previous month’s data to a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil no later than the fifth
business day of the next month. HQ USAF/A3O-AS will consolidate data and send to US Army
Quartermaster Center and School (USAQMC&S), Aerial Delivery and Field Services
Department (ADFSD), Ft. Lee, VA at http://www.quartermaster.army.mil/adfsd/.
5.3. Malfunction, Mishap, and Incident Reporting. Malfunction, mishap, and incident
reporting is a unit-level responsibility, and timely reporting of parachute malfunctions and
incidents is essential. A malfunction is defined as the failure of a parachute system or piece of
equipment to function as it was intended or designed regardless of whether the failure is
attributed to mechanical or human error. A mishap is defined as an unplanned occurrence, or
series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury. Mishaps exceeding the minimum damage
or injury thresholds in AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, require safety reports.
Mishaps involving civil aircraft or FAA functions (such as Air Traffic Control) may require
additional actions per AFI 91-206(I), Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety
Investigation. Major mishaps, especially those involving destroyed aircraft or fatalities, may also
require legal investigation and reporting per AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations. An
incident is defined as an event that affected or could have affected safe operations or the
successful completion of any planned airdrop but that did not result in reportable damage.
Malfunctions, mishaps, and incidents include, but are not limited to the following: towed
jumpers, main canopy deployment issues, main canopy trouble, reserve parachute deployments
of any type, canopy entanglements, automatic activation device/electronic automatic activation
device problems, unintended hazardous landings, equipment issues, oxygen problems, personnel
injuries, and property damage. Submit the following data (extracted from DD Form 1748-2)
within 24 hours of the malfunction or incident to the functional chain of command (including the
MMC PPPM) and to HQ USAF/A3O-AS via email to a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil or
FAX at 702-695-1495. The data elements in this paragraph are consolidated for ease of reference
on     the    “AF      Personnel     Parachute    Program”     community       of    practice     at
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-TO-00-32.                       HQ
USAF/A3O-AS will consolidate data and send to ADFSD when appropriate. Initially, timeliness

       $1,000,000, a permanent partial disability, or inpatient hospitalization of three or more
       personnel (do not count or include individuals hospitalized for observation, diagnostic, or
       administrative purposes that were treated and released).
       5.3.5.3. Class C—Direct mishap cost totaling $20,000 or more but less than $200,000,
       any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or more days away
       from work beyond the day or shift it occurred, or an occupational injury or illness
       resulting in permanent change of job.
       5.3.5.4. Class D—Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does not meet the
       definition of lost time (Class C) which requires medical treatment greater than first aid.
       5.3.5.5. Class E—Occurrences that do not meet reportable mishap classification criteria
       but are deemed important to investigate/report for mishap prevention. See AFMAN 91-
       223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, or AFMAN 91-224, Ground Safety

5.4. Malfunction Officer. AFJI 13-210(I) prescribes qualifications and duties for malfunction
officers. During USAF parachute activities, a malfunction officer must be identified prior to
commencing operations. The following personnel may serve as malfunction officers for USAF
parachute operations: a qualified rigger, the Drop Zone Controller (DZC), or an experienced
parachutist who is qualified for the airdrop operation being conducted. When the DZC acts as the
malfunction officer, malfunction actions take precedence, and drop zone operations will be
suspended until any and all malfunctions are properly investigated and documented.
5.5. Malfunction and Incident Investigations. Investigations are second in priority only to
medical care for injured personnel. The primary purpose of an investigation is to rapidly identify
safety related factors that have bearing on the conduct of USAF parachute operations and to
consider changes to administration, qualifications, standards, requirements, currency, training,
and procedures, when appropriate. Investigate malfunctions and incidents IAW the procedures
and checklists in AFJI 13-210(I) and, if applicable, AFI 91-204. Report events according to
paragraph 5.3.

       unilateral operations. When not qualified through a USAJFKSWC-approved course or
       program of instruction, approval to perform JM duties during joint operations lies with
       the joint commander. Usage of the rescue JM POI is intended for rescue members
       covered under AFTTP 3-1.8 or 3-1.8 and is not authorized for use by other personnel.

Section 6B—Functional Certifications

6.8. Certifications. Functional certifications are those mission requirements that necessitate
oversight, standardized progression, and certification, but that do not lead to the award of
parachutist ratings. MMCs may authorize functional certification programs when the mission
requires specialized skill sets beyond the scope of standard parachute operations. The
determination as to whether certifications eventually convey to another MMC is made by the
gaining MMC. Personnel entered into functional certification must be highly skilled parachutists

  6.11.3. Tandem Passengers. During combat operations, contingencies, and inspections,
  approval for tandem passengers is the Air Component A3, the Joint Special Operations Task
  Force J3, the MMC/A3, or their designated representatives, based on mission requirements.
  In other circumstances, units should utilize military personnel on active parachute status as
  tandem passengers whenever possible. Military tandem passengers must be medically
  qualified for incentive and orientation flights IAW AFI 48-123V3, and be current in
  physiological training if ascent will include unpressurized flight above 9,999 feet MSL IAW
  AFIs 11-403 and 11-409. MMC courses or programs of instruction detail additional pre-jump
  training requirements for tandem passengers. AOs authorizing parachute status and/or the
  award of ratings and badges are not permitted for otherwise unqualified tandem passengers.
  The approval level for the tandem passenger categories that follow may not be delegated.
     6.11.3.1. Category I—jump qualified military personnel on parachute status. Approval
     authority for the passenger’s participation is that passenger’s unit commander.
     6.11.3.2. Category II—non-jump qualified military personnel. The passenger’s unit
     commander and the tandem master’s group commander must approve the jump.
     6.11.3.3. Category III—all other personnel. Use the approval levels for orientation
     flights in AFI 11-401 for tandem passengers not specifically listed in Categories I and II
     and the approval levels for public affairs travel in AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies
     and Procedures, for members of the media. In these cases, the passenger must sign the
     “hold harmless” agreement in Attachment 4.
     6.11.3.4. Coordinate with SAF/PA when tandem passengers are regional, national,
     and/or international figures or when required by AFIs 11-401 and/or 35-101 for Category
     III passengers. Tandem jumps involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign
     disclosure requirements and political concerns IAW AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign
     Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program.

              CURRENCY, TRAINING, AND PACKING REQUIREMENTS

Section 7A—Parachutist Currency and Training Requirements

7.1. Parachutist Currency and Refresher Training Requirements. To be considered current,
a member must meet the standards in paragraph 6.2, be qualified or certified as appropriate, be
on active parachute status, and meet the requirements in this paragraph. Use this instruction in
conjunction with AFTTP 3-3.8, AFMAN 11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220, and AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM 3-
05.211. For mission specific requirements, MMCs may have unique currency and refresher
guidance, however it will not be less restrictive. Document currency and training in ARMS, the
OJT record using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, and/or
appropriate MMC systems. The following are minimum requirements:
   7.1. (ACC) Parachutist Currency and Refresher Training Requirements. To ensure the
   operational safety of the program, activities may conduct additional refresher training when
   the OIC/NCOIC of the parachuting program deem it necessary. Document this training in the
   individual parachutist’s training folder.
   7.1.1. S/L Parachutist Currency. Any S/L parachutist who has not performed a S/L jump
   within the previous 180 days is considered non-current and must complete S/L refresher
   training IAW AFMAN 11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220.
   7.1.2. Free Fall Parachutist Currency. Any free fall parachutist who has not performed a free
   fall jump within the previous 180 days is considered non-current and must complete free fall
   refresher training IAW AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM 3-05.211.
   7.1.3. S/L Jumpmaster Currency. Any S/L JM who has not performed primary or assistant
   JM duties within the previous 180 days, where at least one parachutist actually exited the
   aircraft, is considered non-current and must complete S/L JM refresher training IAW
   AFMAN 11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220. To be considered current, the JM need not exit the aircraft
   when the above conditions are met (static JM); in this case the JM may track the event for JM
   currency purposes but will not log the jump on AF Forms 4323 or 922.
   7.1.4. Free Fall Jumpmaster Currency. Any free fall JM who has not performed primary or
   assistant JM duties within the previous 180 days, where at least one parachutist actually
   exited the aircraft, is considered non-current and must complete free fall JM refresher
   training IAW AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM 3-05.211. To be considered current, the JM need not
   exit the aircraft when the above conditions are met (static JM); in this case the JM may track
   the event for JM currency purposes but will not log the jump on AF Forms 4323 or 922.
   7.1.5. Tandem Master Currency.
       7.1.5.1. Any tandem master who has not accomplished one passenger jump in the
       previous 90 days is considered non-current for personnel and must accomplish refresher
       training IAW MMC guidance.
       7.1.5.2. Any tandem master who has not accomplished one passenger jump in the
       previous 90 days and one tethered bundle jump in the previous 180 days is considered
 36                                          AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


       non-current for oversized cargo and must accomplish refresher training IAW MMC
       guidance.
7.2. Recurring Training Requirements. In addition to currency requirements, parachutists
must adhere to certain minimum requirements for recurring training:
   7.2.1. Sustained Airborne Training. At a minimum, sustained airborne training will consist
   of the JM briefing, aircraft specific procedures, post egress procedures, emergency
   procedures, canopy entanglement procedures, and landing procedures. Sustained airborne
   training is applicable to all parachutists qualified IAW Section 6A and must be conducted
   within 24 hours prior to any USAF parachute operation.
   7.2.2. Free Fall Emergency Procedures Training. Free fall emergency procedures training
   applies to all free fall parachutists qualified IAW Section 6A. Free fall emergency
   procedures training is an annual requirement that consists of classroom training and a
   practical suspended harness or wind tunnel exercise including several parachute/post-opening
   malfunction procedures wearing a jump helmet, goggles, gloves, and oxygen mask, if
   available. The hanging harness or wind tunnel exercise must be administered by a qualified
   free fall jumpmaster. Document training in the OJT record, the JRF, or in the appropriate
   MMC system.
   7.2.3. Intentional Water Jump Training. Prior to participating in intentional water jumps,
   USAF personnel must be current parachutists and classified as basic survival swimmers or
   better as defined in AFMAN 11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220 and TC 21-21. TC 21-21 outlines in
   detail the process used to classify personnel as basic survival swimmers, including rucksack
   waterproofing, full gear walk, confidence check, travel stroke, pool exit, treading
   water/hanging float, and five-minute buoyancy test. TC 21-21 can be accessed in the “AF
   Personnel          Parachute         Program”           community         of        practice:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-TO-00-32.
   Additionally, canopy water confidence training, also known as wet silk training, is required
   by AFMAN 11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220 once every 180 days for personnel conducting
   intentional water jumps. Parachutists who are qualified to serve as safety swimmers per
   paragraph 10.4.1 exceed the basic swimming requirements and are authorized to lead
   canopy water confidence training. Military divers are exempt from the wet silk training
   requirement.

Section 7B—Parachute Packing Requirements

7.3. Static-Line Parachute Packing Requirements. While Section 7B applies in its entirety to
Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) technicians (1P0), the more general term “rigger” is used
throughout to apply to military and civilian personnel qualified through paragraph 7.3.1.
   7.3.1. S/L Rigger Qualification. Only personnel who are qualified S/L riggers are authorized
   to inspect, maintain, repair, and pack USAF S/L parachutes in keeping with the currency
   requirements outlined in paragraph 7.3.3. Qualification training will be documented in the

       pack S/L parachutes by a graduate of a program listed in paragraphs 7.3.1.1, 7.3.1.2, or
       7.3.1.3 are considered first-generation trained and are not authorized to conduct rigger
       checks or to train and qualify other technicians to inspect, maintain, repair, and pack
       USAF S/L parachutes.
   7.3.2. S/L Parachute Rigger Check Guidance. Personnel authorized to perform rigger checks
   on S/L parachute systems are subject to the following requirements:
       7.3.2.1. Must be at least a 7-level AFE technician, 1P071, in the grade of E-5 (or civilian
       equivalent), qualified through paragraph 7.3.1.1, 7.3.1.2, or 7.3.1.3. The first O-6 in the
       member’s chain of command may waive the AFSC and grade requirement if necessary to
       facilitate the production effort. Waived individuals must have at least two years rigging
       experience and meet all other requirements. File a copy of the approved waiver in the
       members OJT record. Waivers are valid for 365 days.
       7.3.2.2. Must have a minimum of one year S/L parachute rigging experience or have
       packed at least 25 of the S/L parachute systems for which they will perform rigger
       checks.
       7.3.2.3. Must meet all Special Certification Roster (SCR) requirements identified in AFI
       21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. The commander’s
       endorsement of the SCR indicates that the member meets all SCR and rigger check
       requirements.
   7.3.3. S/L Rigger Currency. Technicians that have not inspected and packed a specific S/L
   parachute system within the previous 180 days are considered non-current and are not
   authorized to inspect and pack that system until evaluated by a rigger authorized to perform
   rigger checks on the system. Upon successful evaluation, the technician is considered
   current.
   7.3.4. S/L parachute systems are inspected and packed IAW applicable TOs, TMs, and/or
   manufacturer’s published guidance. S/L riggers are initially trained on new systems via
   manufacturer or sister service-provided new equipment training.
7.4. Ram Air Parachute Packing Requirements. While Section 7B applies in its entirety to
AFE technicians (1P0), the more general term “rigger” is used throughout to apply to military
and civilian personnel qualified through paragraph 7.4.1 or 7.7.3.
   7.4.1. Ram Air Rigger Qualification. Only personnel who are qualified ram air riggers are
   authorized to inspect, maintain, repair, and pack USAF ram air parachutes in keeping with

       endorsement of the SCR indicates that the member meets all SCR and rigger check
       requirements.
   7.4.3. Ram Air Rigger Currency. Technicians that have not inspected and packed a specific
   ram air parachute system within the previous 180 days are considered non-current and are not
   authorized to inspect and pack that system until evaluated by a rigger authorized to perform
   rigger checks on the system. Upon successful evaluation, the technician is considered
   current.
   7.4.4. Ram air parachute systems are inspected and packed IAW applicable TOs, TMs,
   and/or manufacturer’s published guidance. Ram air riggers are initially trained on new
   systems via manufacturer or sister service-provided new equipment training.
7.5. Parachute Packing Support. When host base AFE sections cannot adequately support an
organization’s premeditated personnel parachute requirements, MMCs must incorporate the
additional burden placed on AFE sections in manpower studies, equipment requirements, and
operating budgets. Joint airdrop inspections, procedures, and records are covered in AFJI 13-
210(I).
7.6. MFF Parachute Packing Waivers. Qualified riggers are the only personnel authorized to
inspect, maintain, and alter main and reserve canopies and to pack reserve canopies. Under
certain circumstances, MMC/A3s, and A3s at 3 AF and 13 AF, may authorize parachutists to
pack MFF main canopies. The following minimum conditions are required:
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            39


   7.6. (ACC) MFF Parachute Packing Waivers. Approval authority for ACC packing
   waivers is delegated to HQ ACC/A3J. If mission requirements dictate, MFF qualified
   personnel within ACC are authorized to repack MFF main parachute canopies provided the
   appropriate training and certification is accomplished by a USA QMC&S ADFSD Ft Lee
   qualified rigger. Authorization to pack military free fall systems will be forwarded to the HQ
   ACC PPPM, or the AFRC PPPM for ACC gained AFRC members, and the request will be
   evaluated and forwarded with a recommendation to HQ ACC/A3J. Authorization requests
   will indicate specific time frames and personnel. Training and certification must be valid for
   the duration of the waiver period. Training must be documented in the members OJT record.
   7.6.1. Units must have exhausted all reasonable means to have qualified USAF or sister
   service riggers conduct main canopy packing.
   7.6.2. If available, a qualified rigger will supervise main canopy packing by parachutists
   operating under a packing waiver. In the event that qualified riggers are not available, the
   unit commander may appoint a current MFF JM who has been trained by a qualified rigger to
   supervise main canopy packing. The optimal ratio is 6 or less packers per supervisor.
   7.6.3. Parachutists who will pack MFF main canopies must have been trained to pack
   through either a qualification course listed in paragraph 6.6 or by a qualified rigger who has
   been trained on the particular system to be packed. Recurring packing training must be
   conducted annually by a qualified rigger and documented in the member’s OJT records using
   AF Form 1098 or via other organizational systems as appropriate.
   7.6.4. When operating under an approved packing waiver, parachutists are not authorized to
   jump main canopies packed by other parachutists.
   7.6.5. A packing waiver given under paragraph 7.6 is valid for no more than 365 days. The
   intent is to allow mission execution during surge periods or geographically separate
   operations without decreasing AFE section support to other host base activities.
7.7. Advanced Parachute System Packing Requirements. While qualified riggers are the
only personnel authorized to inspect, maintain, and repair main and reserve canopies and to pack
reserve canopies, a packing waiver is not required for parachutists to pack the main canopies of
advanced parachute systems (APS) that they will jump personally. Instead, members must
receive APS main canopy packing training from a qualified rigger who has been trained on the
particular system to be packed.
   7.7.1. Recurring packing training must be conducted annually by a qualified rigger and
   documented in the member’s OJT records using AF Form 1098 or via other organizational
   systems as appropriate.
   7.7.2. Parachutists are not authorized to jump main canopies packed by other parachutists.
   7.7.3. APS Rigger Qualification. As defined in paragraph 8.1.4. APS are ram air parachute
   systems primarily designed for the sport parachute market. As such, the qualifications of
   riggers, administration of rigger checks, packing currency, and criteria for APS are governed
   by paragraph 7.4. In addition to the provisions of paragraph 7.4, those riggers qualified
   (certificated and appropriately type-rated) instead through Federal Aviation Regulation Part
   65 are authorized to inspect, maintain, repair, and pack APS using the guidance contained in
40                                          AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


  both this instruction and FAR Part 105. Where the FAR and this instruction conflict, utilize
  the more stringent guidance (e.g. system-specific currency, etc.).

                                          Chapter 8

                               GENERAL RESTRICTIONS

8.1. Equipment Restrictions.
   8.1.1. General Provisions. While performing official duty, and unless specifically noted
   below, members may only employ parachute systems and equipment approved for their
   unit’s use according to Chapter 4.
      8.1.1.1. In accordance with AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in
      Possession of the Air Force, property management responsibilities limit the use of
      government property to official purposes only. Government owned parachute equipment
      will not be used for personal and/or off-duty activities, and AFI 23-111 specifies
      pecuniary liability for the loss, damage, or destruction of property resulting from
      negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.
      8.1.1.2. USAF parachutists will only jump parachute systems and equipment for which
      they have received system specific training. System specific training is conducted prior to
      the first jump and includes, but is not limited to: canopy flight characteristics,
      harness/container configuration, and satisfactory completion of emergency procedures,
      including hanging harness if available. Only JMs who have received training and jumped
      the intended system are authorized to conduct system specific training for other
      parachutists.
      8.1.1.3. USAF personnel will not use privately owned or leased parachute equipment
      during military parachute operations.
   8.1.2. Foreign Military Parachute Equipment. When the foreign commander of airborne
   forces concurs, and when either the Air Component A3, the Joint Special Operations Task
   Force J3, the MMC/A3, or their designated representative agrees, USAF personnel who have
   received system specific training as defined in paragraph 8.1.1.2 may use foreign military
   parachute equipment when jumping with a foreign unit. The senior USAF JM must complete
   a comprehensive inspection of any foreign military equipment prior to its use. Foreign
   military parachute equipment may or may not be on the AF approved for use list.
   8.1.3. Sister Service Parachute Equipment. Provided they have been trained by a JM as
   defined in paragraph 8.1.1.2, USAF parachutists conducting joint operations may employ
   sister service systems and equipment approved for their unit’s use according to Chapter 4. In
   these cases members operate under the direction of a joint commander, and no special
   permission is required for the equipment usage. When USAF parachutists have been trained
   per paragraph 8.1.1.2, but will utilize sister service systems and equipment that have not
   been approved for their unit’s use according to Chapter 4, special permission is required. In
   this case, the unit commander, sister service unit commander, and senior AF jumpmaster
   must approve use of the systems and equipment prior to the first jump.

   8.1.4. Advanced Parachute Systems. APS can be defined as those ram air systems (canopies,
   harness, container, and EAAD) that are generally not maintained IAW a TO/TM and are
   principally designed for the sport parachuting market. APS are primarily intended for use by
   parachutists who possess functional certifications, by members who are in training leading to
   functional certification, and by the Air Force Parachute Team. Use of APS is limited to those
   parachutists with 50 or more jumps. Members employing APS will not exceed a 1:1 canopy
   loading ratio, where the first figure is the suspended weight and the second is the canopy
   square footage. The AF approved for use list is the authorizing document for APS
   employment. Parachutists must complete system specific training per paragraph 8.1.1.2, and
   unit commanders will designate by letter members authorized to utilize APS. Parachutes that
   support the USAF PPP operational objective of tactically employing forces during war and
   military operations short of war are considered mission parachute systems rather than APS,
   and these systems are employed IAW the applicable TO/TM or manufacturer’s instructions.
8.2. Foreign Military Aircraft. When the foreign commander of airborne forces and the senior
USAF jumpmaster concur, and when either the Air Component A3, the Joint Special Operations
Task Force J3, the MMC/A3, or their designated representative agrees, USAF members on active
parachute status may use foreign military aircraft as authorized jump platforms. Subject to the
provisions of paragraph 8.3, the MMC contracting office is the approval authority for use of
commercially licensed foreign aircraft.
8.3. Private and Commercial Aircraft. When authorized by the unit commander, members on
active parachute status may perform parachute jumps IAW DoD Directive 4500.53, DoD
Commercial Air Transportation Quality and Safety Review Program, and applicable Under
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics memorandums. DoD approved,
certificated carriers must be used for all interstate operations and for intrastate operations when
reasonably priced and available. When DoD approved, certificated carriers are not reasonably
priced and available, commercial operators may be used provided they are inspected IAW USD
(AT&L) memorandum, “Requirements for Airdrop Operations,” dated 31 January 2003. MMCs
will schedule, inspect and approve contractors in accordance with DoD Directive 4500.53,
including aircraft owned or leased by state and/or local governments. See
https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/default.aspx?tab=12 for a listing of approved intrastate carriers.
Units will coordinate with the host base contracting office to ensure compliance.
8.4. Lift Tickets. Subject to paragraphs 8.1 and 8.3, unit commanders may authorize the
purchase of “lift tickets” when civilian aircraft are required to conduct free fall parachute
training. As the government is leasing a seat on the aircraft, and not necessarily reserving all
available seats, it may not be possible to restrict these lifts to military personnel. Separate passes
should be used to deconflict government employed/contracted parachutists from other
parachutists for liability purposes. When separate passes are not feasible, exits made by
government employed/contracted parachutists and other parachutists on the same pass will be
separated by at least five seconds. In these cases, government employed/contracted parachutists
and other parachutists must maintain adequate separation during free fall and under canopy. The
senior USAF JM is responsible for ensuring airspace deconfliction through such tools as exit
order, spacing, pull altitudes, and canopy flight patterns. Drop zone requirements apply as
defined in Chapter 10 and AFI 13-217.
8.5. Documenting Parachute Jumps. Only authorized parachute jumps may be entered onto
AF Forms 4323 or 922 per Attachment 2, entered in ARMS, and filed in the member’s JRF.
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            43


Authorized jumps may occur under the operational or tactical control of a unilateral, joint, or
coalition/multi-national force commander. Parachute jumps are considered authorized when the
following conditions are met:
   8.5.1. The jump is made for official purposes.
   8.5.2. The jump is made by members on active parachute status per paragraph 3.6.
   8.5.3. The jump is made using equipment in keeping with paragraph 8.1.
   8.5.4. The jump is made from DoD aircraft or those aircraft described in paragraphs 8.2,
   8.3, and 8.4.
8.6. Foreign Military Parachutists. Foreign military parachutists participating in combined
operations, combined training, joint airdrop/air-transportability training (JA/ATT), aerial events,
exercises, and US-run military parachute courses are authorized to conduct military jumps from
aircraft owned, leased, or operated by the USAF.
   8.6.1. US Jump Host. The jump host is the US government organization that sponsors
   foreign military parachutists who are required to parachute from aircraft owned, leased, or
   operated by the USAF. The US jump host is typically a unit with a parachute mission,
   however other entities (such as the Defense Attaché Office, MMC staffs, or units having
   control of jump aircraft) may accomplish US jump host duties where appropriate. The US
   jump host is responsible for:
       8.6.1.1. Ensuring foreign jumpers are physically, physiologically, professionally, and
       administratively qualified to perform the parachute operations in accordance with
       applicable foreign military standards.
       8.6.1.2. Ensuring foreign jumpers are authorized to perform the parachute operations by
       the foreign commander of airborne forces.
       8.6.1.3. Gaining approval to conduct parachute operations according to paragraph 8.6.3.
       8.6.1.4. Informing the USAF flying unit of the participation of foreign military
       personnel.
       8.6.1.5. Ensuring that foreign military personnel receive system specific training per
       paragraph 8.1.1.2 if they will utilize US systems or equipment.
   8.6.2. Language Requirements. To ensure that aircraft procedures, safety considerations, and
   jumpmaster instructions are fully understood, aircraft crewmembers and jumpmasters must
   be able to communicate with the foreign jumpers. The approval authorities listed in
   paragraph 8.6.3 determine their requirements for communication and translators.
   8.6.3. Approval Authorities. MMC commanders, including Theater Special Operations
   Commands and overseas Commanders of Air Force Forces (COMAFFORs) having
   operational control of jump aircraft, have the authority to authorize foreign military members
   to conduct military parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased, or operated by the USAF.
   These commanders are authorized to delegate approval authority within their respective
   commands. Additional detail on the transport of foreign military personnel can be found in
   DoD Regulation 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, and AFI 11-401.
       8.6.3. (ACC) Approval authority is delegated to HQ ACC/A3J.
 44                                           AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


8.7. Civilian Parachutists.
   8.7.1. DoD Civilian Employees. MMC/A3s may authorize DoD civilian employees to
   perform official parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased or operated by the USAF.
   Requests concerning USAF civilian positions at joint organizations should substitute the
   MMC/A3 for the joint command’s operations officer, even if this is not a USAF officer.
   Additionally, if the member’s position description specifies parachute duty requirements, the
   member’s commander is the approval authority. DoD civilians do not occupy centrally
   managed parachute positions or draw parachute duty pay and are exempt from the
   requirement to utilize ARMS for documentation purposes. Units with DoD civilian
   parachutists must develop other mechanisms for tracking qualifications and currency.
   8.7.2. US Citizens Not Employed by the DoD. The approval authority for US citizens not
   employed by the DoD to perform official parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased or
   operated by the USAF is the MMC/A3. US citizens not covered by the Federal Employees’
   Compensation Act (FECA) must sign the hold harmless agreement contained in Attachment
   4. US citizens who are not employed by the DoD must be members of the United States
   Parachute Association, possess a D-license, and be certified for the skill being accomplished.
   At no time will the scope of operations exceed the parachutist’s certifications or guidelines,
   as they apply to the jumper. This paragraph also applies to personnel performing government
   contracts since they are not considered DoD civilian employees by virtue of their contract
   and are generally not covered by FECA. When contractors must perform parachute-related
   services, requisite qualifications should be delineated in the contract. When the government
   requires that contractors comply with other portions of this instruction, cite the applicable
   references in the statement of work.
   8.7.3. Foreign Citizens Not Employed by their Armed Forces. HQ USAF/A3O-A is the
   approval authority for requests to allow foreign civilians to fly aboard and jump from aircraft
   owned, leased, or operated by the USAF IAW AFI 11-401. When authorized, these
   parachutists must sign the hold harmless agreement contained in Attachment 4.
8.8. Crew Rest and Duty Limitations.
   8.8.1. AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, establishes crew rest criteria. Due to the unique
   nature of ground operations, parachutists are frequently unable to satisfy these provisions.
   When commanders are unable to comply with published crew rest guidance, they must
   determine the level of acceptable risk to the force and make a judgment concerning mission
   accomplishment.
   8.8.2. Members will not perform parachute jumps:
       8.8.2.1. Within 12 hours after completing a hypobaric (altitude) chamber ride at or above
       25,000 feet MSL.
       8.8.2.2. Within 12 hours after consuming alcoholic beverages.
       8.8.2.3. Within 72 hours after donating blood.
   8.8.3. Refer to the Navy Dive Manual for criteria concerning flying and/or parachuting after
   diving or hyperbaric (recompression) chamber rides. Public access is available at:
   http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&pageId=3.9.

                                            Chapter 9

                                PARACHUTE PROCEDURES

Section 9A—Static-Line Parachute Procedures

9.1. Static-Line Guidance. For S/L parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the
procedures defined in AFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220, AFTTP 3-1.8, and AFTTP 3-3.8 are
authoritative except as noted below. During parachute operations conducted under a joint
commander, use guidance dictated by the joint organization.
9.2. Exceptions to Published Static-Line Guidance. Due to the unique nature of USAF
parachuting, the following exceptions are granted to organizations with parachute missions
governed by this instruction:
   9.2.1. USAF units are not required to use non-jumping safety personnel. The JM may
   designate aircrew members to act as safety personnel. Aircrew members performing safety
   duties will be thoroughly briefed and trained in the handling and control of static-lines.
   9.2.2. USAF units are not required to designate a Departure Airfield Control Officer
   (DACO). Establishing mechanisms for accountability and accomplishing other functions
   traditionally associated with the DACO are unit responsibilities.
   9.2.3. USAF operations only require a single JM on the aircraft, and the JM may be the first
   parachutist to exit on a pass. When the JM will exit first, the aircrew and other parachutists
   must understand the exit procedures (normally the “GO” command and a visual reference
   indicating it is safe to exit) and the method used for aborting the exit. When an aborted exit
   leaves parachutists without a current JM, these parachutists must land with the aircraft.
   9.2.4. Sustained airborne training will be conducted in keeping with paragraph 7.2.1.
   9.2.5. Equipment for USAF parachute operations is authorized via the approved for use list
   IAW Chapter 4.
   9.2.6. According to mission requirements, USAF JMs may have personnel don parachutes
   and equipment while in flight.
   9.2.7. Surface Wind Restrictions. During operational missions, the commander of the force
   to be inserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions
   with the Airborne Mission Commander. During exercises and training, use the surface wind
   criteria listed in AFI 13-217.
9.3. Static-Line Deployed Ram Air Parachutes. Hybrid parachute systems have the ability to
deploy the main canopy via static-line or free fall activation. These systems are restricted to use
by parachutists qualified through paragraph 6.6 (USAF Basic Military Free Fall Parachutist
Rating) who have received system specific training per paragraph 8.1.1.2. Consult the system
specific TO/TM for instructions and restrictions.
       9.3.1. (Added-ACC) When using static-line deployed ram air parachutes, ACC aircrews
       will use the drop zone restrictions and wind limits of a military free fall parachute. In
       addition, the High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) formula will be used for calculating
       the High Altitude Release Point.
 46                                           AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


Section 9B—Free Fall Parachute Procedures

9.4. Free Fall Guidance. For free fall parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the
procedures defined in AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM 3-05.211, AFTTP 3-1.8, and AFTTP 3-3.8 are
authoritative except as noted below. During parachute operations conducted under a joint
commander, use guidance dictated by the joint organization.
9.5. Exceptions to Published Free Fall Guidance. In addition to the exceptions listed in
paragraph 9.2, and due to the unique nature of USAF parachuting, the following exceptions are
granted to organizations with parachute missions governed by this instruction:
   9.5.1. Exit and Parachute Activation Altitudes. Minimum altitudes indicated below are listed
   in either above ground level (AGL) or above water level (AWL), as appropriate.
       9.5.1.1. Overland. For jumps made with mission parachute equipment (non-APS), the
       exit altitude will be no lower than 5000 feet with planned pull not lower than 3500 feet.
       Use the same altitudes for jumps made with the FF-2 system (set at 2500 feet). When
       using APS equipped with the electronic automatic activation device, the exit altitude will
       be no lower than 3000 feet with planned pull not lower than 2500 feet.
       9.5.1.2. Overwater. During overwater free fall operations using parachutes equipped with
       or without an electronic automatic activation device, the exit altitude will be no lower
       than 3000 feet with planned pull not lower than 2500 feet.
   9.5.2. Altimeters. Each parachutist will wear an altimeter when conducting overland free fall
   operations. If waterproof altimeters are available, they will be used for overwater free fall
   operations. At a minimum, water jumps will have one operational altimeter in the aircraft for
   parachutist use. During night operations, altimeters will have either an integrated light or be
   configured with an additional light source adequate to illuminate the face of the altimeter.
   9.5.3. Automatic Activation Device (AAD) and Electronic Automatic Activation Device
   (EAAD). Each parachutist who exits an aircraft in flight will be equipped with an armed and
   functional EAAD or AAD. When waterproof EAADs are available, they will be used for
   overwater free fall operations. Inspection, calibration, arming, and documentation procedures
   for the EAAD or AAD are contained in applicable TOs/TMs and manufacturer’s instructions.
   9.5.4. Surface Wind Restrictions. During operational missions, the commander of the force
   to be inserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions
   with the Airborne Mission Commander. During exercises and training, use the surface wind
   criteria listed in AFI 13-217.
   9.5.5. Free Fall Drop Zone Criteria. The JM will determine the minimum size DZ based on
   the number of personnel to be dropped, jumper proficiency, and prevailing winds. For DZ
   criteria, see AFI 13-217 and Chapter 10 of this instruction. During operational missions, the
   commander of the force to be inserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and
   coordinate DZ criteria with the Airborne Mission Commander.
   9.5.6. Oxygen Requirements. Pre-breathing, physiology technician, and procedural
   requirements for MFF operations that require oxygen are prescribed in AFI 11-409.
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             47


   9.5.7. Contact Flying. Contact flying is defined as pre-meditated contact between jumpers
   during free fall. Personnel conducting contact flying will document progression in OJT
   records.
   9.5.8. Canopy Relative Work. USAF parachutists will not engage in canopy relative work
   while on duty except for specifically authorized Air Force Parachute Team operations.

Section 9C—Jumpmaster Duties

9.6. General Requirement. The primary JM is responsible to the appropriate commander (i.e.
Ground Force Commander, Mission Commander, Flight Commander, etc.) for the conduct of all
phases of the mission that pertain to the parachute operation. Proper planning and execution by
the JM is a critical aspect of tactically inserting parachute forces and supports the operational,
functional, and management objectives of the USAF PPP. Each aircraft dropping parachutists
will have a minimum of one JM, although two are preferable. During operations conducted by
USAF units, the procedures defined in AFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220, AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM
3-05.211, AFTTP 3-1.8, and AFTTP 3-3.8 are authoritative except as noted below. During
parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, use guidance dictated by the joint
organization. While unit operations sections and/or assistant JMs may accomplish many of the
tasks in this section, the primary JM and the commander are ultimately responsible.
9.7. Employment Planning. When the commander determines that parachute employment is
required, the JM is usually given responsibility for planning and executing the jump.
   9.7.1. Establishing mechanisms for accountability and accomplishing other functions
   traditionally associated with the DACO are unit responsibilities that may or may not be
   delegated to the JM. The JM should be intimately familiar with the post-jump movement
   plan since it impacts the individual parachutist’s equipment requirements.
   9.7.2. A DZ survey or site evaluation must be conducted IAW AFI 13-217. For DZs at
   higher elevations, anticipate an increased rate of descent. During combat operations or
   operations short of war for which it is not tactically feasible to conduct a survey, units assess
   intended landing areas through the most accurate means available.
   9.7.3. A weather evaluation must be made to determine current and forecasted drop
   conditions. Wind characteristics are amongst the most important evaluation items. During
   operational missions, the commander of the force to be inserted will weigh the risks to the
   force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions with the Airborne Mission Commander.
   Maximum allowable wind velocity depends on the experience and ability of the team, the
   equipment, the terrain, and urgency of the mission. During exercises and training, use the
   surface wind criteria listed in AFI 13-217.
   9.7.4. The JM is responsible for the items in paragraph 2.12 and for ensuring that all
   parachutists meet currency, refresher training, and recurring training requirements in
   Chapter 7. At a minimum, the JM briefing during sustained airborne training consists of the
   mission purpose and type, equipment requirements, plan of action, special requirements, and
   safety considerations.
 48                                             AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


9.8. Coordination.
   9.8.1. The JM coordinates support requirements to include transportation, DZ scheduling,
   ground party availability, aircraft utilization, and equipment.
   9.8.2. The JM ensures that the DZC has a complete understanding of the operation,
   equipment requirements, number of personnel involved, and special requirements.
   9.8.3. The JM retains overall responsibility for the accuracy of mission parachutist data on
   the passenger manifest.
   9.8.4. The JM is ultimately responsible for briefing safety personnel, conducting a thorough
   inspection of the airdrop aircraft, attending all required aircrew briefs, and determining the
   load and exit order.
   9.8.5. The JM keeps parachutists informed of mission progress and changes.
   9.8.6. The JM is responsible for completing and certifying AF Forms 4323 and/or 922 as
   appropriate and IAW Attachment 2.
9.9. Rigging and Inspecting Parachutists and Equipment.
   9.9.1. The JM ensures that the JM kit is prepared and available per unit SOPs.
   9.9.2. The JM is responsible for rigging door bundles and inspecting personnel parachutes
   and equipment.
   9.9.3. When only one JM is available, specifically trained and certified personnel may
   conduct a JM personnel inspection (JMPI) on the primary JM. These personnel will be
   selected based on experience and recommendation from an OJT certifier and will receive
   JMPI training for systems which they will inspect. JMPI training will be conducted IAW the
   references in paragraph 9.6 and the plans or courses of instruction in paragraphs 6.4.1, and
   6.7.1. Document JMPI training in the member’s training records and via AF Form 797 for
   military personnel.
9.10. Safety. The JM sees that safety standards are enforced and maintains control of
parachutists in and around aircraft. The JM also ensures all parachutists leave the aircraft
properly configured and employ authorized techniques. Additional detail on JM actions in the
unit area, at the departure airfield, and in flight are contained in the references in paragraph 9.6.
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          49


                                          Chapter 10

                               DROP ZONE PROCEDURES

10.1. Drop Zone Guidance. For parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the
procedures defined in AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations, are authoritative.
This chapter defines additional requirements. During parachute operations conducted under a
joint commander, use guidance dictated by the joint organization. Training jumps should closely
duplicate conditions that could be encountered during operational missions, to include rough
terrain, open sea, and unfamiliar or unimproved areas. Care will be taken to ensure that all
conditions, especially those that are safety-related are identified to the JM and jumpers.
10.2. Drop Zone Personnel Requirements. Drop zone personnel requirements are contained
in AFI 13-217.
10.3. Medical Coverage. Medical coverage is required for all non-contingency personnel
parachute operations. In the event of a medical emergency, medical personnel and equipment
will be capable of immediate and appropriate intervention. Medical coverage should be co-
located with the drop zone controller. In certain cases, emergency response capability elsewhere
on the drop zone or at the edge of the drop zone will suffice provided adequate communications
exist between medical personnel and the drop zone controller. Medical coverage for USAF
personnel parachuting operations consists of a minimum of one appropriately equipped and
current Emergency Medical Technician qualified at the basic level or higher.
   10.3.1. Medical personnel must be equipped with functional emergency lifesaving and
   stabilization equipment as well as the means to transport patients to definitive medical care.
   Appropriate equipment should include, but is not limited to: medical kit/rucksack, Kendrick
   Extrication Device (KED), medical anti-shock trousers, oxygen system (AVIOX does not
   support this requirement), spinal immobilization gear, and a litter suitable for medical
   evacuation (with flotation if required). Comparable civilian rescue equipment is acceptable.
   10.3.2. The requirement for medical personnel is satisfied when two or more parachutists
   who meet the requirements in paragraph 10.3 exit the aircraft as part of the first group on
   the first pass. In this case a transportation mechanism is still required, and the medical
   equipment in paragraph 10.3.1 should be collocated with the drop zone controller, the
   transportation mechanism, or otherwise immediately available.
10.4. Intentional Water Operations. Support for intentional water operations will include a
boat operator and a qualified safety swimmer for every boat. Training requirements for
parachutists participating in intentional water jumps are listed in paragraph 7.2.3.
   10.4.1. Safety swimmers must be capable of assisting parachutists who cannot maintain
   buoyancy, who are rendered unconscious, or who become fouled in their equipment or
   parachute system. Equipment and requisite qualifications for safety swimmers are described
   in AFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220. Graduates of the following courses are qualified to
   perform as safety swimmers: any military diving course, Special Forces Water Infiltration
   Course, Navy Rescue Swimmer Course, Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Course,
   Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technician A-School, Army Class 1 advanced survival
   swimmer (ICW TC 21-21), Army Basic Scout Swimmer, USMC Basic Scout Swimmer,
   USMC CWS1, Navy 1st class, American Red Cross life guard, or American Red Cross open
50                                           AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


  water rescue. Commanders may require that safety swimmers be qualified military divers
  when conditions warrant.
  10.4.2. Safety boat personnel must be trained and equipped to quickly locate and recover
  distressed personnel on the surface. Military or civilian training programs, including the
  USCG Boat Operators Course, are acceptable.
  10.4.3. During USAF intentional water operations, one power driven recovery boat is
  required for every three parachutists on a single pass IAW AFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.
  When all parachutists will be military divers, the minimum number of power driven recovery
  boats is one for every six parachutists on a single pass. Airdropped boats are not considered
  functional until completely operational, at which point they may be used for recovery
  operations. Planners should ensure that parachutists will not exceed Coast Guard and
  manufacturer boat load limits, and water craft will not be smaller than a Zodiac F-470. Safety
  boats must be appropriately equipped to support water recovery operations IAW AFMAN11-
  420(I)/FM 3-21. A working search light is required for night operations.
  10.4.4. Medical coverage must be in place prior to personnel airdrops. If medical personnel
  are not in the same safety boat as the drop zone controller, communications must be assured.
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          51

                       PARACHUTE RELATED AERIAL EVENTS

Section 11A—The Air Force Parachute Team

11.1. Charter. In keeping with USAF PPP objectives, the Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) is
chartered to conduct parachute related aviation support to public and/or military events, to
support general USAF and jump-inherent specialty recruiting, and to instruct premeditated
parachute procedures that improve survivability, develop confidence, and establish an
airmanship foundation. The AFPT, popularly known as the “Wings of Blue,” has showcased
parachute capabilities during aerial events for public and military audiences since 1964.
11.2. Administrative Guidance. All parachutists at the AFPT are subject to the procedures and
documentation requirements detailed in Chapter 3, as clarified in this paragraph.
   11.2.1. Parachute Positions. AFPT military staff parachutists occupy valid parachute
   positions and are eligible to draw parachute duty pay based on the same rules that apply to
   other USAF parachutists. Aviation cadets assigned to the AFPT support its charter and are
   required to be on active parachute status, however they are not eligible to draw parachute
   duty pay and are not assigned an ASC in conjunction with paragraph 3.6.2. As such, these
   parachutists occupy student authorizations rather than parachute positions, which imply a
   budget obligation.
   11.2.2. Documentation. Aviation cadets who are both assigned to the AFPT and eligible for
   the basic parachutist rating are authorized to document parachute jumps in the ARMS
   operational or training databases in order to ensure compliance with standards, requisite
   qualifications, and currency. Members may not count parachute jumps made as an aviation
   cadet towards advanced ratings, unless these jumps are made while enrolled in another
   program, such as those in paragraph 6.3.1. Members of the AFPT are not required to utilize
   AF Form 4323 as described in paragraph A2.1.1 and may instead document individual
   parachute jumps using AF Form 922 as a primary source for updating ARMS.
11.3. AFPT Procedures. While AFPT members qualified through paragraph 6.3.2 are not
considered MFF parachutists (unless also qualified through paragraph 6.6), they are free
fall/HALO parachutists subject to the provisions in Section 9B and elsewhere in this instruction,
as clarified in this paragraph.
   11.3.1. Certification. Apart from the qualification training prescribed in Section 6A, AFPT
   progression and competencies (e.g. non-JM upgrade progression, certification to jump public
   relations devices, etc.) are considered functional certifications and are administered by the
   MMC in accordance with paragraph 6.8. During parachute competitions where parachutists
   must perform aerial videography in accordance with competition rules, the AFPT’s parent
   MMC is the waiver authority for the restrictions contained in paragraph 8.4 concerning
   separation between government employed/contracted parachutists and other parachutists.
   11.3.2. Currency. In addition to the provisions in Chapter 7, in order to jumpmaster active
   AM-490 students, a JM must have performed duties within the previous 365 days where
   parachutists actually exited the aircraft. Non-current JMs and parachutists will accomplish
   refresher training IAW MMC procedures.
 52                                           AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


   11.3.3. Equipment. In accordance with paragraph 7.7.3 of this instruction, the AFPT is
   authorized to satisfy its requirement for parachute rigging by employing senior or master
   riggers qualified through FAR Part 65. Parachutists assigned to the AFPT are exempt from
   the 50 jump APS minimum and are authorized to exceed the APS canopy loading ratio in
   paragraph 8.1.4 by up to and including 1.3:1, where the first figure is the suspended weight
   and the second is the canopy square footage. In this case, parachutists will follow a MMC
   approved transition plan.
   11.3.4. Exit and planned pull altitudes. The minimum planned pull altitude for AFPT
   parachutists using APS is 2500 feet AGL per paragraph 9.5.1.1, however AFPT members
   using APS may exit at 2500 feet AGL (clear and pull) . During parachute demonstrations and
   competitions, the drop zone control officer may waive both the exit and the planned pull
   altitude to no lower than 2000 feet AGL (clear and pull). HQ USAF/A3O-AS will not waive
   planned exits or pull altitudes below 2000 feet AGL.
   11.3.5. Based on the nature of the aerial event mission, the AFPT is exempt from completing
   formal drop zone surveys as required by AFI 13-217. The AFPT will adhere to MMC
   approved procedures to mitigate risk in this area.

Section 11B—Aerial Events

11.4. Aerial Event Guidance. A functional objective of the PPP is to provide parachute related
aviation support to public and/or military events to showcase military preparedness, demonstrate
capabilities, promote good community and international relations, support USAF recruiting and
retention efforts, and render military honors. AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
governs USAF participation in aerial events. Parachutists typically participate in two types of
aerial events: static displays and aerial demonstrations. Attachment 1 defines terms that pertain
to aerial events. Forward requests for events that involve USAF parachuting IAW AFI 11-209.
Commanders of flying organizations are encouraged to provide airlift support for parachute
participation in aerial events.
   11.4.1. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Guidance. Parachutists participating in aerial
   events must comply with applicable FAA guidance, including Federal Aviation Regulation
   Part 105, Order 8440.5A, Order 8900.1, Advisory Circular 91-45C, Advisory Circular 105-
   2C.
   11.4.2. United States Parachute Association (USPA) Guidance. Parachutists participating in
   public aerial events must comply with applicable USPA guidance contained in the Skydiver’s
   Information Manual.
   11.4.3. Parachute jumps made in direct support of other PPP objectives are not considered
   aerial events. In these cases, it is a MMC responsibility to determine when FAA and USPA
   guidance apply.
   11.4.4. Unless specifically noted, guidance articulated elsewhere in this instruction is
   applicable to personnel and aircraft participating in aerial events. The waiver authority is
   specified in paragraph 1.5.
11.5. Capabilities Demonstrations or Capabilities Exercises (CAPEX). A CAPEX is a type
of aerial demonstration in which parachutists demonstrate operational equipment and TTPs
common to the military capability being displayed. Parachutists are not authorized to jump flags,
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             53


streamers, banners, smoke, or other public relations devices in conjunction with a CAPEX.
MMC approved capability demonstrations using operational S/L and/or MFF parachute systems
and TTPs may be conducted using personnel who maintain qualifications and currency through
Part 2.
11.6. Parachute Demonstrations. A parachute demonstration is a type of aerial demonstration
conducted during public or military events principally for community and international relations,
esprit-de-corps, or recruiting purposes. As they showcase precision parachuting, demonstrations
require planning, detailed coordination, strict adherence to applicable guidance, routine practice,
and an experienced team.
   11.6.1. Minimum Qualifications. Commanders will carefully select parachutists to
   participate in parachute demonstrations based upon experience, maturity, and demonstrated
   capability. For demonstrations that call for free fall employment, parachutists must have a
   minimum of 100 ram air canopy jumps. Commanders will identify and certify members for
   participation in aerial events on AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
   Continuation/Command JQS.
   11.6.2. Organizations that conduct parachute demonstrations are encouraged to utilize a
   narrator to help interpret the experience for the audience. Narration is a functional
   certification that should tie introductory, historical, descriptive, and contingency scripts into
   USAF messages such as general or jump-inherent specialty recruiting.
   11.6.3. Parachutists who jump flags, streamers, banners, smoke, or other public relations
   devices will be functionally certified for the task by their MMC. Such devices must not
   interfere with the safe deployment and operation of any parachute system.
   11.6.4. The use of APS for parachute demonstrations is limited to the AFPT.
   11.6.5. The conduct of canopy relative work (CRW) is limited to AFPT members only.
   AFPT members are functionally certified to conduct CRW by their parent MMC.
   11.6.6. As it relates to aerial events, the term parachute demonstration does not refer to the
   functional PPP objective of instructing and demonstrating proper premeditated and
   emergency egress procedures as a part of survival or parachute training programs.
11.7. Parachute Competitions. Parachute competitions are a type of aerial demonstration,
generally conducted as a public event by an event organizer.
   11.7.1. Minimum Qualifications. The AFPT commander will carefully select parachutists to
   participate in parachute competitions based upon experience, maturity, and demonstrated
   capability. The minimum experience is normally dictated by competition category by the
   event organizer. Commanders will identify and certify members for participation in aerial
   events on AF Form 797.
   11.7.2. The conduct of CRW is limited to AFPT members only. AFPT members are
   functionally certified to conduct CRW by their parent MMC.

Terms
Advanced Parachute System (APS)—Those systems (canopies, harness, container, and EAAD)
that are generally not maintained IAW a TO/TM and are principally designed for the sport
parachuting market. APS are primarily intended for use by parachutists who possess functional
certifications, by members who are in training leading to functional certification, and by the Air
Force Parachute Team. Parachutes that support the USAF PPP operational objective of tactically
employing forces during war and military operations short of war are considered mission
parachute systems rather than APS.
Aerial Demonstration—A subset of aviation support, includes virtually every type of aerial
participation in public or military events.
 60                                             AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


Aerial Event—Synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display, flyover, aerial
review, and aerial demonstration. Parachutists are principally involved in aerial demonstrations
and static displays.
Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT)—The USAF parachute team, popularly known as the
“Wings of Blue.” The AFPT has showcased parachute capabilities during aerial events for
public and military audiences since 1964.
Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—Associated with either
aircraft or parachutists demonstrating operational equipment and tactics, techniques, and
procedures. A CAPEX is a type of aerial demonstration.
Capability Development Document (CDD)—Captures the information necessary to develop a
proposed program, and outlines the affordability increment of capability for a spiral acquisition
strategy. The CDD provides the operational performance attributes and is updated for each
increment so the values only apply to the increment considered.
Combat Capability Document (CCD)—Used to document deficiencies arising during combat
or crisis operations. It is used in the Rapid Response Process to accelerate the fielding of critical
systems to meet theater-specific wartime needs. The CDD replaced the Combat Mission Needs
Statement (C-MNS) and is described in AFI 63-114, Rapid Response Process.
Combined Operation—An operation conducted by forces of two or more allied nations.
Drop Zone Controller (DZC)—A qualified individual in charge of a DZ operation who
represents the appropriate commander per AFI 13-217.
Free Fall Parachute—A parachute system in which the canopies are deployed by the
parachutist during free fall descent.
Incident—Event that affected or could have affected safe operations or the successful
completion of any planned airdrop but that did not result in reportable damage.
Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)—Makes a case for a capability to resolve a gap identified
by JCIDS analysis. Defines gaps in terms of functional areas, relevant range of military
operations, time, obstacles to overcome, and key attributes with appropriate measures of
effectiveness, as well as proposes a recommended solution serving as the beginning for analysis
of alternatives. Once approved, it is not normally updated.
Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)—Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
Staff system for identifying, assessing, and prioritizing joint military capability needs. It
implements a capabilities-based approach to better leverage the expertise in government
agencies, industry, and academia to identify improvements to existing capabilities, and to
develop new warfighting capabilities. Parachute requirements are generally delegated to the
lowest approval level in the process due to the comparatively small force size and low monetary
thresholds involved.
Joint Operation—A general term to describe military actions conducted by joint forces or
service forces in relationships (i.e., supported, supporting, coordinating), which, of themselves,
do not constitute joint forces. In this context, a joint operation is any operation conducted under
the authority of a joint commander. When a USAF commander is the supported commander, that
commander may have this instruction govern employment of the joint force.
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           61


Major Military Command (MMC)—An umbrella term for the Air National Guard, field
operating agencies, HQ USAF direct reporting units, and major commands to include Air Force
Reserve Command. The Office of Personnel Management defines a MMC as a military
organization next below the Departments of the Army, Air Force, or Navy and headed by a flag
or general officer who reports directly to the agency headquarters. For purposes of simplicity and
applicability, this instruction categorizes the ANG and those FOAs and DRUs not headed by
general officers as MMCs.
Malfunction—The failure of a parachute system or piece of equipment to function as it was
intended or designed, regardless of whether the failure is attributed to mechanical or human
error.
Mean Effective Wind—A theoretical wind of constant velocity and direction, extending from
the surface to a predetermined altitude above the ground.
Military Event—An official DoD event conducted in support of an assigned mission, including
purposes of esprit-de-corps, primarily for military or civil service personnel, dependents, and
limited guests. The event must be hosted on a facility owned, leased, or operated by the DoD.
Mishap—An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—The originating office for a publication. The author
of the publication is an individual within the office, in this case the USAF PPPM.
Parachute Badge—A distinctive emblem worn on a member’s uniform that signifies attainment
of a USAF parachutist rating. Parachutist badges correspond to USAF parachutist ratings and are
permanent unless specifically revoked.
Parachute Rating—A classification that represents a member’s level of parachute experience.
The USAF awards basic ratings by publishing an AO when a member meets the standards and
qualification requirements in Chapter 6 and the requirements listed in AFI 11-402 pertaining to
length of service and number and type of jumps. The USAF awards advanced ratings to members
who attain specified levels of experience.
Pass—An approach made over the DZ by an airdrop aircraft. Several groups or sticks of
parachutists may exit on a single pass.
Point of Impact (PI)—The point on the drop zone where the first airdropped parachutist or
equipment load is expected to land when the exit is made at the release point.
Public Event—Community relations event not connected with the military functioning of the
DoD and intended primarily for non-military audiences. Some examples include military open
house events, ceremonies, exhibitions, expositions, athletic contests, fairs, parades, tattoos,
airshows, international airshows and trade exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may be
on or off-base, CONUS or OCONUS. Public events can be sponsored by either DoD or non-
DoD organizations. Military exercises, movements, maneuvers, or operations are not considered
to be public events merely on the basis of being incidentally observed by the general public.
Such events can be good community relations and recruiting opportunities.
Release Point—The computed point where personnel or equipment should exit the aircraft to
land on the target.
Rigger—An individual qualified to inspect, pack, and repair parachutes.
 62                                          AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


Static Display—A subset of aviation support, the ground display of personnel and equipment
that comprise a military capability.
Static Line Parachute—A parachute system in which a line or strap is attached from the
parachute to an anchor cable in the aircraft so that, when the jumper exits the aircraft, the
parachute is deployed automatically.
Student Authorization—A term used uniquely to define a position that requires parachuting at
the USAF Academy that is not subject to the validation process in paragraphs 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5.
Personnel in student authorizations are typically cadets, but not universally (e.g. unassigned
active duty personnel attending AM-490). Student authorizations are used to place members on
active parachute status for the purpose of enrollment in AM-490, AM-491, AM-492, or AM-496.
Personnel in student authorizations are not assigned an Aviation Service Code and are not
authorized to draw parachute duty pay, however cadets enrolled in AM-491 or higher-level
programs are authorized to document parachute jumps in the ARMS operational or training
databases in order to ensure compliance with standards, requisite qualifications, and currency.
AFPT military staff parachutists occupy valid parachute positions as opposed to student
authorizations.
Unilateral Operation—An operation conducted by a single service. In this context, any
operation conducted under the authority of a USAF commander where joint participation is
incidental to the overall operation.

A2.1. Prescription. This instruction prescribes AF Form 4323, ARMS Multi-Crew Jump
Record, and AF Form 922, Individual Jump Record, as source documents for recording and
reporting operational or training jump information for members authorized to take part in
parachute operations. These forms constitute the official record of individual jumps for USAF
members and are used to substantiate parachute duty pay eligibility for members IAW this
instruction.
   A2.1.1. AF Form 4323. AF Form 4323 is the primary mechanism for documenting
   individual parachute jumps made by USAF members and the source document used to
   update ARMS. AF Form 4323 replaced AF Form 922 as the primary documentation
   mechanism on July 1, 2003.
   A2.1.2. AF Form 922. AF Form 922 is currently utilized to document individual parachute
   jumps made by USAF members with military agencies outside of the member’s unit of
   assignment or attachment. This form is an alternate method to record individual jump activity
   for a member who performs several missions, in different aircraft, for different days, and/or
   with non-USAF organizations. In these cases, AF Form 922 is used as a source document to
   update ARMS.
A2.2. Additional Form Responsibilities. AF Forms prescribed by this instruction are
maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363.
   A2.2.1. Jumpmaster.
       A2.2.1.1. Prior to the jump, review GO/NO GO data for each parachutist (if not
       previously authenticated by the organization’s ARM) to verify that members meet the
       standards and qualifications in Section 6A and the currency requirements in Section 7A.
       A2.2.1.2. Ensure the AF Form 4323 (or 922) is dated and properly completed to reflect
       all pertinent jump types, conditions, and activities/duties for all personnel who are
       authorized to take part in the jump. Sign the form as the certifying official.
       A2.2.1.3. Hand-carry the completed original form to the ARM so the data can be entered
       in ARMS. Delays in submitting forms may result in parachute duty pay interruption.
   A2.2.2. Aviation Resource Management Office.
       A2.2.2.1. Ensure a responsible individual audits AF Forms 4323 and 922 for accuracy,
       enters the data in ARMS, verifies the ARMS data using the daily jump activity summary
       or browser equivalent, and signs and dates the form before sending it to the HARM.
       Where local procedures establish the HARM as the auditing agency, the HARM updates,
       signs, and dates the form.
       A2.2.2.2. Maintain the original form in the HARM office that services the unit to which
       the member is assigned.
       A2.2.2.3. Validate proficiency requirements for parachute duty pay purposes.
A2.3. Explanation of Codes. AF Forms 4323 and 922 utilize the following codes to represent
pertinent jump types, conditions, and activities/duties:

 72                                            AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


A5.6. (ACC) Evaluations.
   A5.6.1. (ACC) Recurring Evaluations. Recurring evaluations help to ensure that
   parachutists within ACC are trained to conduct military parachute operations safely and
   effectively. Evaluations should focus on safety using established procedures, checklists, and
   directives. Individuals will be evaluated while performing their highest parachutist rating
   level (i.e., MFF jumper, MFF Jumpmaster). The evaluator may act as a "trainee" for the
   purposes of the evaluation. All evaluations are graded pass/fail. Individuals qualified to
   perform both Military Freefall (MFF) and static line jumps should perform an MFF
   parachute deployment if weather and air assets are suitable at the time of the scheduled
   evaluation. If dual qualified, every attempt will be made to alternate type of jump evaluated
   (N/A for re-qualification evaluations). In no case will the same type jump be evaluated on
   three consecutive recurring evaluations.
   A5.6.2. (ACC) Initial Evaluation. All newly assigned personnel must receive an initial
   evaluation prior to performing parachute operations without trainer/evaluator supervision.
   This should be accomplished within 60 days of arrival. The initial evaluation requirements
   are the same as for the Recurring Parachute Evaluation (RPE) in A1.2.1
   A5.6.3. (ACC) Recurring Parachute Evaluation (RPE). RPEs are administered every 17
   months after the individual receives his/her initial parachute evaluation. The 17-month
   qualification period begins at the end of the month in which the initial evaluation was
   accomplished and at the end of the month for each subsequent RPEs. The eligibility period
   begins the first day of the 5th month prior to the end of the qualification period (e.g., initial
   eval accomplished 10 Jan 01, RPE is due NLT 30 Jun 02 and eligibility window begins on 1
   Jan 02). A RPE consists of a records review, emergency procedures evaluation in a hanging
   harness, and parachute deployment. The records review and hanging harness exercise must
   be accomplished prior to the parachute deployment.
      A5.6.3.1. (ACC) Suspended Harness Emergency Procedures Exercise. The suspended
      harness emergency procedures exercise will be conducted in a harness similar to each
      parachute system used (i.e., MC-4, Vector, B-22Z, etc.). The exercise will focus on
      proper execution of parachutist emergency procedures and should be a review of all
      emergency procedures "in the air". This review will be documented in the individual's AF
      Form 623 on AF Form 1098. NAFs will submit evaluation criteria and standards to HQ
      ACC/A3J for review prior to implementing. This will allow specific parachute systems to
      be addressed by the using units.
      A5.6.3.2. (ACC) Records Review. The records review must be completed prior to
      deployment and should not be accomplished more than 1 week before the jump. The
      evaluator will review pertinent documentation relating to the individual's capability to
      conduct safe parachute deployment procedures. A records review must be accomplished
      for all parachute evaluations prior to actual deployment (including a short notice spot
      eval). As a minimum, the following will be reviewed:
      A5.6.3.3. (ACC) AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder. The evaluator will
      ensure that the individual is current and qualified by reviewing AF Form 803, Report of
      Task Evaluations; AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command
      JQS; AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training; AF Form 1887,
AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                        73


     Aeronautical Order (PA) Aviation Service; and AF                 Form    1042,   Medical
     Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty.
     A5.6.3.4. (ACC) Written Guidance. Publications, directives, and checklists necessary to
     perform safe parachute operations must be current.
     A5.6.3.5. (ACC) Parachute Deployment. The deployment phase will consist of a
     mission briefing, to include an Operational Risk Management (ORM) assessment,
     equipment preparation, aircraft deployment, and mission debriefing.
  A5.6.4. (ACC) Short Notice Spot Evaluations. The unbiased, random, and systematic use of
  Spot Evaluations are a means of providing feedback to commanders on the effectiveness of
  the Parachute Stan/Eval program. They are not the only means of determining its
  effectiveness, but when used consistently, are a valuable tool for ensuring a safe and
  competent parachute operations training and evaluations program.
     A5.6.4.1. (ACC) Spot evaluations may be administered by a qualified evaluator during
     any parachute deployment.
     A5.6.4.2. (ACC) Personnel receiving spot evaluations must be notified of the evaluation
     prior to the start of the mission briefing.
     A5.6.4.3. (ACC) Spot Evaluations may count as RPEs as long as they are given within
     the member's eligibility period and all the requirements of the RPE are met.
     A5.6.4.4. (ACC) Areas found to be substandard will result in decertification of the
     appropriate task(s). Appropriate training to resolve deficiencies noted during the
     evaluation will be accomplished and documented prior to conducting a follow up
     evaluation for task certification.
     A5.6.4.5. (ACC) Commanders should be informed of the results of all Short Notice
     Spot Evaluations.
  A5.6.5. (ACC) Requalification Evaluation. Individuals who fail an evaluation require at
  least one training session addressing the area(s) failed during the evaluation and need to be
  recommended by a qualified trainer prior to the requalification evaluation. Requalification
  evaluations should be conducted within 30 days of eval failure. Document the training and
  recommendation in AF Form 623. The requirements are the same as for the RPE. Failures of
  a requalification evaluation may require Review Board action.
  A5.6.6. (ACC) Administration of Evaluations. A sound and practical evaluation program is
  a prerequisite for effective evaluation. Evaluators must have the judgment necessary to meet
  unexpected or induced emergencies and the ability to exercise judgment through mature
  realization of their own and their trainees' limitations. An evaluator's familiarity with the
  concepts of safe parachute deployments and sound judgment are critical factors to proper
  assessment of performance. Evaluations will be documented using AF Form 803.
     A5.6.6.1. (ACC) Grading. Pass/Fail.
     A5.6.6.2. (ACC) Substandard Performance.
         A5.6.6.2.1. (ACC) Minor Infractions. The evaluator will discuss and correct minor
         procedural violations that do not jeopardize safety during the debriefing.
74                                          AFI11-410_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2013


         A5.6.6.2.2. (ACC) Compromised Safety. When the evaluator determines that safety
         has been compromised, or about to be compromised, he will immediately cease all
         operations. The evaluator, using sound judgment and ORM principles, may either
         assume the duties of the individual being evaluated and continue the mission or
         thoroughly critique the individual and allow the mission to continue, or cancel the
         deployment. A safety compromise will result in the individual being decertified from
         any further jumps until a re-qualification evaluation is given. For dual qualified
         jumpers, the evaluator will determine if the infraction warrants decertification for
         both types of qualifications and will document appropriate recommendations on the
         AF Form 803 and in the individual's AF Form 623 as appropriate.
         A5.6.6.2.3. (ACC) Task Decertification. Evaluations resulting in task decertification
         must be in compliance with AF OJT guidance.
         A5.6.6.2.4. (ACC) Evaluator Restrictions. Evaluators will not evaluate personnel
         they have trained unless no other option exists. Evaluations will not be changed to a
         training mission and a training mission will not be changed to an evaluation after the
         start of the Mission Briefing.
  A5.6.7. (ACC) Evaluation Briefings. Evaluators will ensure the examinee understands the
  parameters of the evaluation prior to the start of the evaluation.
  A5.6.8. (ACC) Evaluation Debriefings. The evaluation debriefing may be the most
  important phase of the evaluation process. It provides a forum for potential learning and/or
  reinforcing the concept of safe parachute operations. Conducting a proper debrief allows
  maximum benefit from the information collected and may be used to identify excellence or
  deficiencies in the parachute training segment.
     A5.6.8.1. (ACC) To enhance the debriefing, evaluators should take notes during the
     evaluation process (except, of course, during actual aircraft deployment).
     A5.6.8.2. (ACC) The evaluator should review these notes and proceed chronologically
     through the events of the evaluation relating all aspects, whether positive or negative.
     A5.6.8.3. (ACC) The evaluator must reinforce the positive aspects and professionally
     critique the negative aspects, offering corrective action, as necessary.
     A5.6.8.4. (ACC) The examinee must be afforded an opportunity to contribute his/her
     comments, observations, and recommendations.
     A5.6.8.5. (ACC) Key unit personnel should attend as many evaluation debriefings as
     schedule permits.
     A5.6.8.6. (ACC) The debriefing is not complete until the evaluation is properly
     documented in the individuals AF Form 623 and the AAR is completed.
  A5.6.9. (ACC) Documentation Procedures. Documentation is a performance indicator not
  only of the trainee, but the Parachute Stan/Eval Program as a whole. Concise and factual
  documentation provides a history of tasks accomplished and the conditions in which they
  were accomplished. Improper or sloppy documentation results in a poor or incomplete
  picture of the individual and should not be tolerated.

     will not perform those duties until additional training or a requalification evaluation is
     successfully completed as appropriate.
     A5.6.9.6. (ACC) AF Form 623A. The AF Form 623A is used to expand upon comments
     logged on the AF Form 803. The AF Form 623A is used for recommendations and
     explanation of restrictions or for recommendations for review board action. Use the AF
     Form 623A to record positive performance as well as negative. In order for the comments
     to be considered valid, the evaluator's and trainee's initials must be recorded after
     comments.
     A5.6.9.7. (ACC) AF Form 1098. This form consolidates the status and history of
     qualifications, examinations, and training of a critical or recurring nature where key
     personnel can readily review them.
        A5.6.9.7.1. (ACC) Column A --Enter the selected special task training or evaluation
        (Initial, JOC, Requal or Spot).
        A5.6.9.7.2. (ACC) Column B --Enter completion date of the evaluation or special
        training or written exam.
        A5.6.9.7.3. (ACC) Column C --The certifying official signature completes the
        documentation and indicates the individual's qualification to perform parachute
        operations without direct supervision.
        A5.6.9.7.4. (ACC) Column D -- Trainee initials.
        A5.6.9.7.5. (ACC) Column E -- Pass or Fail for evaluation.

      in remarks section.
   A5.6.10. (ACC) Partial Evaluations. In the event a scheduled evaluation is planned, briefed,
   and flown to a weather or equipment cancellation, the evaluation will be graded as a partial
   evaluation. A spot or another planned evaluation will be conducted within 30 days to include
   all areas missed. If unable to conduct the evaluation within 30 days, a complete evaluation
   will be re-accomplished.
A5.7. (ACC) After Action Reviews.
   A5.7.1. (ACC) General. An After Action Review (AAR) is a method of conducting
   continuous evaluation and improvement to equipment and procedures. It must be considered
   a way of life in the unit. An AAR is the basis for commanders and Unit Stan/Eval Monitor to
   assess their unit parachute training capability. The AAR is used to provide feedback and
   solicit ideas to improve safety during parachute operations. Commanders will ensure that
   AARs are maintained in a "read" file according to the RDS that will be reviewed by each
   jumper prior to parachute operations. Units will develop a method of ensuring this review has
   been accomplished prior to the mission briefing. All newly assigned jump qualified
   personnel will review the previous 12-month's AARs. Document the initial review in the
   individual's AF Form 623. See sample AAR.
      A5.7.1.1. (ACC) The AAR consists of three parts:
          A5.7.1.1.1. (ACC) Event Description. Include desired objectives/goals.
          A5.7.1.1.2. (ACC) Narration. Describe actual events and accomplishments.
          A5.7.1.1.3. (ACC) Conclusions. Recommended improvement areas.
   A5.7.2. (ACC) AAR Cross-Tell. To enhance unit effectiveness and continually improve
   training, headquarters use feedback from subordinate unit's AAR to distribute cross-tell. This
   allows adjustments in resources, personnel, training methods, and can be used to refine
   mission and standardize equipment and procedures among the instructor force.
      A5.7.2.1. (ACC) Unit Training Monitors. Consolidate lessons learned from AARs
      semiannually, and up-channel reports to respective groups, respective NAF, and HQ
      ACC/A3J.
      A5.7.2.2. (ACC) HQ ACC/A3J. Consolidate reports and disseminate semiannually to
      all organizations.
      A5.7.2.3. (ACC) Unit Level Consolidated Report Format. Unit reports consist of a
      discussion and recommendation for each of three areas: Trends, Procedural Improvement,
      and Equipment Improvement. Each trend and/or improvement should be discussed and a
      recommendation provided.
