1. Objective
1.1. To establish a base program to control and promote the economic recovery of precious
metals from excess, used and surplus precious metal-bearing material and the use of recovered
precious metals as government-furnished materiel and for other authorized AF uses. The metals
covered in the PMRP include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, osmium and
ruthenium. As a practical matter, only four of the eight precious metals – silver, gold, platinum
and palladium are routinely recovered.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. 377th Air Base Wing Commander (377 ABW/CC) will:
        2.1.1. Appoint a primary KAFB PMRP manager (and an alternate PMRP manager, when
        deemed appropriate) in writing, to act as the focal point for all matters concerning the
        PMRP.
     2.2. The PMRP Manager will:
        2.2.1. Provide a copy of the appointment letter to the DRMS and each using
        organization.
        2.2.2. Ensure that each organization on the installation that is involved in the PMRP
        appoints a PMRP monitor and an alternate, as required. The appointment letter shall
        include, at a minimum, the PMRP monitor’s/alternate’s name, organizational account,
        phone number(s) and location. The PMRP monitor and alternate shall be appointed by
        the organization’s commander or member of management for non-military entities.
        2.2.3. Maintain a list of each organization and, using the locally developed product, 19E
        Daily Record for Metals, identify the precious metals issued during the month. This
        product will be used for periodic review.
        2.2.4. Maintain a record of fine precious metals that are furnished as government-
        furnished materiel (GFM) including contract number and contractor’s name and address.
        2.2.5. Ensure that organizations that receive issue and use fine precious metals or high
        precious metals content items that are assigned Controlled Item Code (CIC) ―R‖ appoint
        an individual, in writing, to receive and issue these items.
        2.2.6. Ensure that each organization that generates a hypo-solution has a silver recovery
        unit in place. Where electrolytic units are installed, appoint, in writing, an individual to
        harvest the silver flake or sludge. Ensure a third party (one who does not operate the
        equipment or harvest the silver) witnesses the harvesting and weighs the flake, sludge or
        cartridge and signs the disposal document as being accurate and true.
        2.2.7. Ensure that each unit initiates and maintains a self-assessment program. Include,
        at a minimum, control and protection of precious metals residue; compliance with receipt,
        issue, storage and turn-in procedures and periodic testing of hyposolution.

     2.2.8. Prepare a schedule, visit each participating organization and conduct inspections at
     least once every 24 months to review the operations, documentation and compliance with
     overall program requirements. Prepare and maintain a report of deficiencies noted during
     inspections. Provide a suspense copy of findings to the organization for corrective
     action(s). Perform a follow-up visit within thirty days to ensure that unit monitors correct
     any discrepancies.
     2.2.9. Notify the appropriate depot item manager of any items found to contain precious
     metals, if a Precious Metals Indicator Code (PMIC) has not been assigned, or if the PMIC
     is incorrect.
     2.2.10. Act as liaison with DRMS to keep abreast of precious metals recovery
     techniques. Request guidance from DRMS concerning procedures for the recovery and
     transfer of precious metals.
     2.2.11. Ensure that organizations that receive, issue, handle and use fine precious metals
     or high precious metals content items assigned a CIC ―R‖ keep accurate records and
     ensure a disinterested third party audits these records and quantities of material on hand
     at least semiannually.
  2.3. Unit Commanders will:
     2.3.1. Appoint, in writing, a primary and alternate PMRP monitor for their organization.
     (Forward a copy of the appointment letter to the Base PMRP Manager).
     2.3.2. Appoint, in writing, individuals to harvest silver flake or sludge from electrolytic
     units or to change silver recovery cartridges, if used by the organization.
     2.3.3. Appoint, in writing, personnel, other than PMRP monitors, to receive, issue and
     turn-in fine precious metals or high precious metals content items assigned a CIC ―R,‖ if
     these items are used by the organization.
     2.3.4. Provide proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for safe handling of items

              in the outflow, while the silver recovery unit is operating. Laboratory tests will be
              as required or whenever indicated. This is an optional document for unit monitors
              but if it is not maintained in the unit's file, each work center must document all
              testing of discharges.
    2.5. Resource Protection:
       2.5.1. Organizations will use DoD 5200.8, Security of DoD Installations and Resource,
       AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program and KIRTLANDAFBI 31-101,
       Installation Security Instruction as guides when establishing protection requirements for
       fine precious metals, items bearing precious metals and high precious metals content
       items.
KIRTLANDAFBI 23-101 14 NOVEMBER 2011                                                          5


       2.5.2. Determine locally specific protection requirements, such as the need for alarms,
       controlled areas and physical security of materials and equipment, considering the value
       of each category. Request guidance from the base Security Forces, 377 SFS/SFAR and
       the Resource Protection Manager when establishing these requirements.
3. Identification of Precious Metals:
   3.1. Precious Metal Indicator Codes (PMIC): An assigned PMIC identifies items that
   contain precious metals. PMIC’s, except ―A‖, indicates recoverable items (see Attachment
   2). Anyone discovering an item that might contain precious metals, without an assigned
   PMIC, will notify the base PMRP manager.
   3.2. Recoverable PMIC: Assignment of a recoverable PMIC will cause a phrase to print on
   the issue document that identifies the type of precious metals it contains. All organizations
   using items with recoverable PMIC are tasked with turn-in or recovery of precious metals.
   3.3. Bench Stock Items: The organizational Bench Stock Listings contain the PMIC
   assigned to bench stock items. Highlight, in blue, bench stock bin labels and shadow boards
   for precious metals items. This will assist with identification and aid in recovery of these
   items by requiring a one-for-one exchange whenever an item is issued.
4. Specific Recovery Procedures:
   4.1. The base PMRP manager is not responsible for completing the recovery procedures.
   Instead, the base PMRP manager is responsible for assisting unit PMRP monitors to ensure
   that all economically feasible recovery procedures are followed. Expendable, scrap and
   recovered material will be turned in directly to DRMS, using the procedures in AFMAN 23-
   110.
   4.2. Scrap material. Each organization or work center will have containers available for
   collection of precious metals scrap. Provide separate containers for each PMIC or scrap
   classification list (SCL) coded item (see Attachment 3). Collection of scrap by the PMIC or
   SCL is at the option of the generating organization or work center.
   4.3. When possible, items that can be identified by their National Stock Number (NSN)
   should be separated, individually marked as unserviceable/condemned and processed
   according to procedures in AFMAN 23-110.
   4.4. Do not place non-precious metal scrap in containers designated for precious metals
   scrap.
   4.5. Each organization or work center will maintain a recovery log to record turn-in of
   precious metals scrap. This log will consist of the following information:
       4.5.1. Description of material.
       4.5.2. PMIC or SCL code, as applicable.
       4.5.3. Weight of material turned-in, indicating gross, tare and net weights.
       4.5.4. Signature of witness and date, if applicable.
   4.6. Each PMIC or SCL will require a separate DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
   Document. The organization will generate the DD Form 1348-1A via the DRMS Electronic
   Turn-In Document (ETID) page and ship the property as downgraded to scrap.

    Organizations are individually responsible for obtaining a DRMS account, user
    identification/password at http://www.drms.dla.mil. Follow all steps in the ETID and the
    DD Form 1348-1A will be generated with all required information. Each organization will
    be assigned a block of numbers to assign to the ETID for tracking and identification purposes
    (see Attachment 4). All documents will contain the same basic information of FB4469 and
    the processing Julian Date.
    4.7. For accumulated items with mixed NSN’s or NSN’s that cannot be specifically
    identified, identify the item by precious metals managed by Defense Supply Center
    Philadelphia (DSCP) (see Attachment 5).
    4.8. Generators will coordinate with local DRMS to schedule the turn-in of property. The
    turn-in request will be required before an actual schedule can take place. Generator will visit
    the DRMS scheduling website at https://www.drms.dla.mil/scheduling/generator/turn-in
    to schedule the appointment or contact local DRMS representative for assistance in opening
    the appointment on the calendar.
    4.9. After the property has been delivered to DRMS, delivery individual will forward a copy
    of the signed 1348-1A document to the base PMRP manager for filing.
