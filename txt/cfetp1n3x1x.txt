                  CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN


Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, and training support
resources. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor
in all aspects of career field training. Civilians occupying associated duty positions will use Part
II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors use both parts of the plan to plan, manage, and
control training within the career field.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression
information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. Section C
associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, experience, training, and other).
Section D indicates resource constraints: Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and
facilities. Section E, when used, identifies transition training guide requirements.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS)
and includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support training, Air Education and
Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, and correspondence course
requirements; Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will
use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support
materials; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources
available to support training, including both mandatory and optional courses; Section E
identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional
training required for the associated qualification needs. At the unit level, supervisors, trainers,
Command Language Program Managers (CLPMs), Language Mentors, and Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs) will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the
overall goals of this plan.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan will enable us to
train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

Foreign Language Proficiency Bonus (FLPB)/Foreign Language Proficiency Pay (FLPP).
Monetary incentive paid to eligible and qualified military (FLPB) and civilian (FLPP) personnel
possessing foreign language proficiency. The objective of FLPB/FLPP is to encourage the
acquisition, maintenance and enhancement of foreign language skills vital to national defense.
The ability of the Air Force to interact in the international arena and respond effectively to any
global contingency mandates the need for qualified personnel to communicate with our allies and
the local populations as well as with our adversaries. An Airman's application, qualification for

resident and non-resident courses, National Cryptologic School (NCS) courses, Partner
Language Training Center-Europe courses, local college courses, and Internet sources (Ref:
DLI PAM 350-9).

       Initial Acquisition Language Training. Basic language instruction program
        designed for personnel who have no measurable proficiency in the target language.
        Acquisition language training is any formal language training program designed to
        achieve a minimum ILR skill level L2/R2/S1+ upon completion. Short-term,
        accelerated courses, sometimes known as turbo courses, are not considered to be
        acquisition-level training unless determined by the AFCFM.

              Conversion Training. Formal acquisition-level training designed to achieve
               proficiency in a language or dialect that is similar to a language or dialect for
               which ILR skill level L2/R2 has already been achieved (e.g. Modern Standard
               Arabic to Levantine Arabic; Persian Farsi to Persian Dari). Conversion training
               normally occurs when additional language skill is required to complement
               existing skills to meet mission requirements. Training is typically shorter in
               duration than that which would be required if a minimum ILR skill level L2/R2
               in a similar language did not exist.

              Relanguage. Formal acquisition-level language training that provides an
               additional language capability to an Airman in a language that is disparate from
               the language for which ILR skill level L2/R2 has already been achieved (e.g.
               Modern Standard Arabic to French). Relanguaging normally occurs when
               additional language skill is required to complement existing skills to meet
               mission requirements (e.g. Arabic to French). The decision to relanguage an
               individual rests with the functional management community (CFM).
               Relanguaging will not result in a change to an individual’s AFSC.

     Enhancement Training. Generic term for training designed to increase foreign language
    proficiency.

MAJCOM and FOA Functional Managers. SNCOs who manage designated enlisted career
fields for a MAJCOM or FOA and serve as liaisons to their respective AFCFMs. MAJCOM and
FOA Functional Managers monitor the health and manning of their career fields within their
command and elevate concerns to AFCFMs. They manage command training for their career
field and coordinate command training and personnel issues across their MAJCOM or FOA staff
and AFCFMs. They disseminate Air Force and career field policies and program requirements
affecting their career field throughout the MAJCOM or FOA. They coordinate with the Air
Force Personnel Center, through their respective A1 Directorate, to distribute personnel
throughout the MAJCOM or FOA to ensure proper command prioritization of allocated/assigned
personnel resources. They provide functional and subject matter expertise to Air Education and
Training Command Training Managers to develop new or modify/improve existing training
programs (REF AFI 36-2618).

Upgrade Training. Mandatory training which leads to the attainment of a higher skill level.

Wartime Skills. Wartime skills/tasks training are initiated based upon a national emergency.
These wartime skills are identified by the letter “w” in the 3-level position of the STS and will be
taught at an accelerated course at Goodfellow AFB while the trainee is going through technical
training school.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM and
FOA Functional Managers, commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan,
develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. This plan
outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress
throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and
proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS-specific training an individual receives
upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.
Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade
training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements and correspondence
course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. Qualification
training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific
duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.
It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced
training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional
training; in-residence, exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to
personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.
The CFETP also serves the following purposes:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
individual's career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements in the specialty and recommends
education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.

1.3. Lists training courses available for the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the
training delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints impacting full implementation of the desired career
path training process.

2. Use of the CFETP. The plan will be used by Functional/Training Managers and supervisors
at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each
individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and
exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of


                                                 9

the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM and RI Manager to develop acquisition
strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and
proficiency requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training,
contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this RI must be
identified for inclusion into this plan.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.
The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM
will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.
MAJCOM/FOA representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on
the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate
duplicate training.

its mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training do his or her part to plan, manage,
and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP
will ensure individuals receive viable training at appropriate points in their career. The
following narratives, in addition to Part I, Section B, paragraph 8, identify the 1N3X1X career
training path. It defines the training required over an individual’s career.

5.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Initial training in this specialty consists of an in-residence language
course normally taught at the DLIFLC at the Presidio of Monterey, CA, followed by
cryptologic skills training at Goodfellow AFB, TX. DLI in-residence training focuses on global
language skills. Demonstrated language proficiency (L2/R2), as measured by the DLPT, must
be achieved prior to entering cryptologic skills training. For OPI-only languages or those with
only one testing modality, level 2 or better must be achieved. Prior language knowledge at this
level, as measured by the DLPT, may eliminate the need for in-residence training at DLI.
Cryptologic skills training will include transcription, typing, familiarization with electronic
equipment, principles of security, the classification process, intelligence community, radio
fundamentals, and related topics necessary to understand the duties and responsibilities of a
CLA. Task knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS, Part II of this CFETP.

5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. To qualify for award of the 5-skill level, Airmen must: (1)
Complete Career Development Course (CDC) 1NX51; (2) Complete a minimum of 12 months
in upgrade training (9 months if a retrainee); (3) Meet mandatory requirements listed in the
AFECD and CFETP; (4) Be recommended for upgrade by their supervisor; (5) Possess
minimum language proficiency scores L2/R2 as measured by the DLPT, or level 2 for OPI-only
languages or those with only one testing modality. Individuals in this skill level should strive to
achieve level 2+ in all assessable modalities and/or acquire additional language(s).

5.3. Craftsman (7) Level. To qualify for award of the 7-skill level, Airmen must: (1) Hold at
least the grade of SSgt; (2) Complete a minimum of 12 months as a 5-skill level (6 months if a
retrainee); (3) Meet mandatory requirements listed in the AFECD and CFETP; (4) Be
recommended for upgrade by supervisors; (5) Possess minimum language proficiency scores
L2/R2 as measured by the DLPT, or level 2 for OPI-only languages or those with only one
testing modality. Individuals in this skill level should strive to achieve level 3 in assessable
modalities and/or acquire additional language(s).

5.4. Superintendent (9) Level. To qualify for award of the 9-skill level, an individual must
be promoted to E-8 and satisfy all criteria outlined in AFECD.

5.5. Intelligence Occupational Badge. Wear the basic badge after completing technical
school. Wear the senior badge after award of the 7-skill level, and wear the master badge as a
Master Sergeant or above with 5 years in the specialty from award of the 7-skill level. For
retrainees, credit toward new badges starts upon entry into the new AFSC. EXCEPTION: Chief
Master Sergeants cross-flowed into a new CEM Code wear the basic badge of their new career
field uponaward of the CEM code, the senior badge after 12 months, and the master badge after 5
years (Ref: AFI 36-2903).

6. Training Decisions. The CFETP encompasses the entire spectrum of training requirements
for the 1N3X1X AFS (Day one through separation or retirement). The spectrum includes a

strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be
apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to
training.

6.1. Foreign Language Proficiency.

6.1.1. Standard. The Director, National Security Agency requirement for language proficiency
is L3/R3. The Air Force expectation is that all CLAs will strive to meet the L3/R3 standard.
Currently, the Air Force minimum CLA proficiency standard is L2/R2 for the CLA’s CAFSC
language. For OPI-only languages or those with only one testing modality, CLAs must achieve a
level 2 or better. These standards also apply to personnel who were accepted into the AFSC
without attending formal language training at DLIFLC (DLI by-pass). CLAs who have received
DoD funded acquisition-level training designed to achieve the minimum proficiency standard in
more than one language or dialect, are only required to meet the standard as it pertains to their
particular CAFSC language. Air Reserve Component (ARC) - Guard and Reserve – CLAs must
maintain the minimum proficiency standard in the language for which they are assigned in their
current duty position. The waiver authority for the ARC Guard and Reserve is the respective
CFM.

6.1.2. Testing. Unless otherwise directed, the DLPT or OPI is the primary method for testing
language proficiency. All MSgt and below CLAs, to include DLI by-pass CLAs, must annually
test in their control/primary shred language and/or dialect, if applicable. Although not required,
CLAs are highly encouraged to test in any other language for which they possess a capability.
CLAs failing to test within the required timeframe will be considered sub-proficient and entered
into RLTP. ARC Guard and Reserve CLAs are only required to test annually in the language
assigned in their current duty position though they are welcome to test in other languages.

6.1.3. Training.

6.1.3.1. Individual Language Training Plan (ILTP). An ILTP for all MSgt and below CLAs
must be developed within 30 days of arrival at first duty station and modified at a minimum
within 30 days after they take the DLPT/OPI for their control/shred language and/or dialect.
The ILTP will be developed and modified by CLAs and their supervisors, in coordination with
a language mentor and CLPM, to provide a path to improving a CLA’s foreign language skills.
The ILTP will outline specific weekly/monthly enhancement training requirements and identify
appropriate courses for the member to improve their weaknesses. A copy of the ILTP will be
maintained on the Air Force Language Portal. For ARC Guard and Reserve CLAs, an ILTP
must be developed within 90 days of arrival at first duty station and modified at a minimum of
90 days after each DLPT/OPI for all languages and/or dialects for which the CLA is required to
maintain proficiency.

6.1.3.2. Weekly/Monthly Enhancement Training. All MSgt and below CLAs will adhere to the
maintenance requirements established by their chain of command for their CAFSC language.
At a minimum, sub-proficient CLAs must adhere to the maintenance requirements of the RLTP.

6.1.3.3. Significant Language Training Events (SLTEs). All MSgt and below CLAs must attend a
SLTE within 1 year of achieving their apprentice (3) skill level and preferably 12 but no later than


                                                12
                                     UNCLASSIFIED
                                    UNCLASSIFIED


18 months thereafter for their control/shred language and/or dialect . Members who were
accepted into the AFSC without attending formal language training at DLIFLC (e.g. DLI by-
pass) must also attend a SLTE every 18 months for their control/shred language and/or dialect.
Sub-proficient CLAs must adhere to the SLTE requirements of the Remedial Language
Training Program (RLTP). CLAs with scores of L3/R3 or better in a language are required to
attend a SLTE for that language at a minimum of every 24 months. Any unit or location that
cannot meet the required SLTE schedule will submit a request for a training delay to
AFISRA/A3T prior to expiration of current SLTE. ARC Guard and Reserve CLAs with scores
below L3/R3 must attend a SLTE for their operationally assigned language every 18 months.
Those who maintain L3/R3 or better may be directed to attend a SLTE every 24 months.

6.1.3.4. Documentation. All language training must be documented in an AF Form 623 or
similar tracking system. If language training documentation is not maintained in the AF Form
623, the record should indicate where training is documented. It is recommended that all
administrative documentation be included for clear and accurate record keeping. All training
program and waiver requests will be evaluated based on the information contained in these
records.

6.1.3.5. Remedial Language Training Program (RLTP). All MSgt and below CLAs who fail to
meet the minimum proficiency standard in their control/shred language and/or dialect will enter
into RLTP status. Official entry into the program will be recognized from the date the CLA
records a sub-proficient score on the DLPT/OPI. A RLTP entry document is highly
encouraged to provide situational awareness to the CLA and chain of command; however, lack
of an entry does not preclude adherence to the one-year proficiency requirement. CLAs who
PCS while enrolled in the RLTP will transfer in status. A CLA who is not proficient in the
language and/or dialect tied to their CAFSC should not volunteer for, or be considered for
deployments. ARC Guard and Reserve: All MSgt and below CLAs who do not meet the
minimum proficiency standard will enter RLTP only in the language assigned in the current
duty position; the training window will last no greater than two years unless otherwise
specified by the respective Guard or Reserve CFM.

6.1.3.5.1. RLTP Process. Once a CLA records a sub-proficient DLPT/OPI score, CLPMs will
interview the supervisor and the CLA within 10 duty days to determine reasons for failure,
provide guidance, and ensure completion of a diagnostic language assessment. Using diagnostic
assessment results, the CLA and their supervisor, in coordination with a language mentor and
CLPM, will revise member’s existing ILTP. The goal of the modified ILTP will be to return
CLAs to the minimum proficiency standard as soon as possible. Ideally, these events should be
discussed during Performance Feedback sessions. At a minimum, the ILTP will include 12
hours per month of directed supervised, tailored language training and one SLTE. Within 60
days of the diagnostic assessment, sub-proficient CLAs will be scheduled for a SLTE. CLAs
who retest and attain the minimum proficiency standard will be removed from the RLTP for that
language and/or dialect. The ILTP should be revised at this time to ensure the CLA does not
again fall below the minimum proficiency standard in that language and/or dialect. A CLA
who is not proficient in their CAFSC language and/or dialect shall not volunteer for, or be
considered for deployments. Extenuating circumstances negatively affecting RLTP progress
shall be annotated in training records. ARC Guard and Reserve: Once a sub-proficient
DLPT/OPI score is recorded by the CLA, the interview should be conducted within 60 days.

                                      UNCLASSIFIED


The ILTP will include at a minimum 12 hours per month of directed supervised, tailored
language training and one SLTE. Within 120 days of the diagnostic assessment, sub-proficient
CLAs will be scheduled for a SLTE. CLAs who retest and attain the minimum proficiency
standard will be removed from the RLTP for that language/dialect. The ILTP should be revised
at this time to ensure the CLA does not again fall below the minimum proficiency standard in
that language/dialect. A CLA who is not proficient in the language/dialect assigned in the
current duty position shall not volunteer for, or be considered for deployments. Extenuating
circumstances negatively affecting RLTP progress shall be annotated in training records. The
appointed CLPM must work closely with the respective ARC Guard and Reserve CFM for any
exception to this policy.

6.1.4. Post RLTP. Upon completion of remedial status, Airmen remaining below standards
must be processed for reclassification within 30 days, unless otherwise determined by the Career
Field Manager. AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel, contains procedures for these
actions. CLAs awaiting reclassification are not required to adhere to testing, training or
proficiency standards. Upon completion of RLTP, a six-month waiver may be approved by the
CFM; requests for waivers must be routed for approval within 30 days of RLTP completion.
For ARC Guard and Reserve CLAs, reclassification will be processed within 120 days, unless
otherwise determined by the respective Guard or Reserve CFM.

6.1.5. Repeated Failures. Commanders should consider AFSC disqualification for MSgt and
below CLAs entered into remedial status 3 times within 7 years or less for the same
language/dialect.ARC Guard and Reserve commanders and units will work closely with the
respective CFM for administrative actions for MSgt and below CLAs.

6.2. Training Resources. Language enhancement training at DLIFLC, the National
Cryptologic School, or other training venues will be advertised via local CLPMs.

7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). CCAF is one of several federally chartered
degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military
enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the
Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award
AAS degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-
campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and
assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program
and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. In order to be
awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from
the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF website for details
regarding the AAS degree programs at http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/. Note: As of 1 January
2011, CCAF changed the title of the degree applicable to the 1NXXX, 1A8XX, 8D000, and
9L000 AFSCs. The new title is Intelligence Studies and Technology. Members who earned a
degree with the previous title, Communications Applications, have already earned the equivalent
degree for their AFSC and ARE NOT eligible to receive the Intelligence Studies and
Technology degree.

Part II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. The attached Specialty Training Standards will be used for technical
training provided by AETC for classes beginning after April 2014.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, AIR FORCE TRAINING PROGRAM, an STS:

2.1. Lists the Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References necessary for Airmen to perform
duties in a specialty. Column 1 identifies the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical
references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. All 3-
level line items in the STS are trained during technical school. Column 2 lists the core/tasks
identified by the AFCFM. In addition to these core tasks, all CLAs have an inherent core task
to maintain language proficiency at a minimum of L2/R2, as measured by the DLPT, or level
2 for OPI-only languages or those with only one testing modality.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of task and
knowledge training requirements. When placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training
Record, the STS serves as a Job Qualification Standard (JQS). Task certification must
show a certification/completed date. All other documentation should be performed in
accordance with AFI 36-2201. Note: Additional JQS line items may apply for certain
commands/ workcenters and are typically identified on an AF797, Job Qualification
Standard Continuation/Command JQS.

2.3. Outlines formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the
task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the course. Attachment 1 contains the
proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident
training and Career Development Courses.

2.4. Serves as a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman
Promotion System (WAPS) if there is a Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT) for that AFSC/Skill
Level. There is currently no SKT for AFSC 1N3X1X for any skill level.

2.5. IAW AFI 36-2201, chapter 6 for all changes to a CFETP to include: Converting to a New
CFETP, Transcribing, Decertification and/or Re-certification. An AFJQS may be used in lieu of
Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM. NOTE: AFCFM may supplement
these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their career field.
3. The STS for AFSC 1N3X1X contains the following attachments:

3.1. Attachment 1 - Qualitative Requirements. Contains the proficiency code key used to
indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and Career
Development Courses.
3.2. Attachment 2 - 1NX Common Core. Covers the fundamental tasks and knowledge items
required of all 1NX personnel, regardless of specialty.

6.1. NSA Intern Programs.

6.1.1. Military Language Analyst Program (MLAP) (Includes Arabic, Chinese, Korean,
Persian, Russian, and Spanish Programs). The MLAP is a prestigious 3-year internship
program at NSA/CSS Washington designed to enhance the language and technical skills of
selected CLAs through advanced formal training and a series of individually tailored operational
assignments. Participants will be enrolled in individually structured programs consisting of
formal language and related SIGINT-focused classroom instruction and operational work
assignments. Specific coursework and operations assignments will be determined based on the
participant’s cryptologic experience, desire, and language proficiency. The goal of the program
is to provide each service cryptologic component with a cadre of highly trained professional
military CLAs—technical leaders, who are capable of filling the most demanding language-
related positions. The program is available to qualified E-4 thru E-6 CLAs with at least 3 but no
more than 8 years of service. Air Staff calls for nominations for this program annually in the late
August/early September timeframe and applications are typically due to the Air Staff in late
November. For more information about this unique opportunity, please visit the ISR Forces
SharePoint site: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-IN-AF-05/default.aspx or contact the MLAP
Managers at sla_military@nsa.gov.

specifically for CLAs and focuses on language enhancement, MECCAP is aimed at broadening
Intelligence Professionals from many different specialties in areas such as collection
management; intelligence and signal analysis; reporting and dissemination; research and
engineering; information security/information operations; and support to military/intelligence
community operations. The goal of the program is to provide a career broadening work/study
environment that develops highly skilled cryptologic managers for future active duty cryptologic
positions requiring greater expertise and responsibility. This includes providing them with an in-
depth understanding of relationships within the National Intelligence Community. Air Staff calls
for nominations for this program annually in the late August/early September timeframe and
applications are typically due to the Air Staff in late November. For more information about
this career broadening opportunity, please visit the ISR Forces SharePoint site:

6.1.3. Computer Network Operations Development Program (CNODP). The CNODP is a
technically demanding 3-year internship program at NSA/CSS Washington comprised of both
the System and Network Interdisciplinary Program (SNIP) and the Global Network Exploitation
and Vulnerability Analyst (GNEVA) Development Program (GDP). This is an opportunity for a
select group of highly technically inclined individuals to further develop their skills in the areas
of secure system design, vulnerability analysis, computer network defense (CND), and computer
network exploitation (CNE). The goal of the program is to develop a cadre of technical leaders
who will improve the DoD’s and Service’s CNO capabilities. Upon completion of the program,
graduates will receive an individually tailored follow-on assignment to best capitalize on his/her
expertise. Air Staff calls for nominations for this program annually in the September timeframe
and packages are typically due to the board in mid-January. The announcement message can be
