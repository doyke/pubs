       Area of Responsibility (AOR) including rotary and fixed-wing, as well as joint/allied
       assets. Training also should cover major categories of ground equipment and naval
       vessels.
       3.3.2.2. Training should incorporate all aspects/angles, theater specific paint schemes, fin
       flashes and various configurations. Training should teach aircrew how to describe threats
       they encounter to assist intelligence personnel in positive identification.
       3.3.2.3. Include examples of weapons employment training to illustrate to aircrew how
       threats might appear when employed (e.g., air bursts, muzzle flashes, etc.).
       3.3.2.4. When available, utilize Higher Headquarters developed VR training programs,
       CDs and web-based training materials.
   3.3.3. Collection & Reporting (C&R).
       3.3.3.1. Focus training on items necessary to enable aircrew to initiate aircrew-originated
       reports (In-flight Report (INFLTREP), etc.) and familiarize them with the information
       requirements of the intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and Intelligence
       Report (INTREP).
       3.3.3.2. Ensure training identifies and describes both theater-specific reporting
       requirements and peacetime MAJCOM reporting requirements including applicable

                    AIRCREW INTELLIGENCE TRAINING REPORT

MEMORANDUM FOR XX SQ/CC

FROM: [UNIT]

SUBJECT: Summary of Squadron Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT)

1. Of the 125 combat mission ready (CMR) aircrew assigned to the XX Airborne Air Control
Squadron (AACS), 78 percent have received all of their required intelligence training topics for
this training cycle. The status of intelligence training is listed below:
 XX AACS Training Summary
 Total aircrew                                                    125
 Avg. complete:                                                   78%
 Most common topics not completed:                                SA-2
                                                                  MiG-25
2. IAW the AIT Plan, all aircrew are required to be trained on each training item at least once
each training cycle. At the completion of the training cycle, the following aircrew members have
not completed the annotated training items:
 Name                                               Intelligence Training Item
 John A. Doe                                        SA-2, MiG-25, Su-27
 Susan L. Smith                                     MiG-25
 Zane G. Thomas                                     SA-2/3/8, MiG-25
 Ed D. Tyler                                        PR, ISOPREP
3. The annual Intelligence MQF test was administered on [DATE]. All CMR aircrew have
taken the 100 question test (50 questions and 50 visual recognition slides). While not all aircrew
obtained the minimum passing score of 80 percent the first time around, all tests have been
corrected to 100 percent. A total of 125 aircrew took the test. The initial average test score for
the squadron was 95 percent.
 XX AACS Intelligence Test Results

 Knowledge questions                                              50
 Knowledge questions—average score                                92%
 Knowledge questions—most commonly missed                         5 (SA-2)
                                                                  8 (SA-6)
                                                                  13 (MiG-29)
                                                                  14 (Collection)
                                                                  21 (Reporting)
 Visual Recognition Slides                                        50
 Visual Recognition—average score                                 98%
 Visual Recognition—most commonly missed                          MiG-21
4. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
AFI14-2E-3V3 17 December 2012                                                                 39


and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and MiG-29
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
