   and recreational buildings, having a capacity of 100 persons or more with panic hardware
   and self-closing devices. Keep building emergency exits clear at all times and identify these
   by using signs or lights according to NFPA 101, Life Safety Code.
10                                                                   30SWI32-102 22 JULY 2009


     15.4. Do not install any device that hinders the operation of panic hardware or exit doors.
     15.5. When a building is modified, such as the installation of additional walls, relocate exit
     lights to ensure they are clearly visible to the occupants.
     15.6. Doors opening to stair enclosures or horizontal exits will be self-closing and shall not
     be left open at any time.
     15.7. Penetrations to fire rated walls or ceilings will have covers or doors with an equivalent
     fire rating. All buildings constructed with attics will have at least one attic access point. All
     attic access points will remain closed to prevent the vertical spread of fire to the attic area.
     15.8. Do not store combustibles beneath stairways.
     15.9. Do not restrict the movement of doors in hallways and corridors by any means. Only

16. Vegetation/Brush Control:
     16.1. Much of Vandenberg AFB’s vegetation/brush is highly flammable Southern California
     chaparral. Many base facilities are scattered throughout our 99,000 plus acres and are at risk
     from wildfires. Vegetation / brush control becomes critical in managing the fire threat. A
     defensible space is the best fire prevention tool. Typically, vegetation / brush clearance for
     facilities in urban interface areas should be a minimum of 100 feet where feasible. Special
     vegetation/brush clearance consideration for mission critical or high hazard facilities in urban
     interface areas will be assessed on a case by case basis through the Fire Prevention Office.
        16.1.1. Where slope and fire hazards warrant, the clearance and thinning will be
        increased to fit the conditions. Appropriate clearance will be determined by the Fire
        Prevention Office.
        16.1.2. Where the surrounding vegetation is predominantly sparse grass, remove all
        flammable vegetation/brush for at least three feet and keep a minimum of 15 feet well-
        trimmed around all structures.
     16.2. Remove vegetation/brush within the diked area around any flammable fuel tank.
     16.3. Remove vegetation/brush from within a 50-foot area around any stationary fuel-
     dispensing unit.
     16.4. Do not store grass cuttings in paper bags, cardboard boxes or other combustible
     containers in or adjacent to any building or structure.
17. Unpaved or Off Road Vehicle Travel:
     17.1. Personnel who are required to operate vehicles and equipment off road will receive a
     fire prevention briefing by the shop supervisor.

18. Vehicle Parking:
   18.1. Do not position vehicles or trailers in any manner that would block access of fire
   equipment to all sides of buildings, in fire lanes, within 15 feet of fire hydrants or fire

   department connections and hydrants will be considered a fire lane. All fire lanes will be 20
   feet wide.
   18.2. Gasoline or oil trucks (whether loaded or empty) will not enter hangars or other

   19.1. Open fires, campfires, burning of rubbish and similar material within the limits of
   Vandenberg AFB will not be permitted without the approval of the fire chief or designated

   20.2. When a fire extinguisher has been used to control a fire, been accidentally discharged,
   has a broken seal, requires annual inspection, or becomes inoperative for any reason, the
   using organization must call the Fire Prevention Office. A control number will be issued and
   the customer can call the local contractor to have the extinguisher/s serviced at the using
   organization’s expense. Date stickers on the extinguisher indicate the date annual inspection
   was accomplished.

     Association codes. Do not use combustible materials, such as fiberboard and plywood for
     partitions, walls, and ceiling coverings. Materials and alterations must not detract from
     original life safety design criteria and must comply with current codes and regulations
     governing the type of occupancy involved.
     25.2. Any facility modification, alteration or self-help project performed requires prior
     approval on an Air Force Form 332, BCE Work Request.
     25.3. Any facility modification or alteration affecting fire detection and suppression systems
