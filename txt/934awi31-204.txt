   3.7. When a military member who has accumulated points is transferred to another
   installation, AF Form 1313 will be forwarded to his/her new duty station.
4. Traffic Law Enforcement:
   4.1. The entire system will be enforced and administered by the Security Forces
   Commander. The following personnel are designated as authorized representatives of the
   Security Forces Commander:
      4.1.1. Military and civilian personnel of the 934th Security Forces Squadron.
      4.1.2. Augmentee personnel, from any other branch of the Armed Services who are in a
      duty status, and performing those duties under the supervision of the Security Forces
      Commander.
   4.2. The traffic system will be supervised and inspected by selective enforcement. The use
   of time-distance speed checks is authorized anywhere on this base. All security force
   vehicles used for speed checks have had their speedometers calibrated; radar devices used are
   calibrated and have an authorized frequency.
   4.3. Headphones, Earphones, and Cellular Telephones. Use of these devices hinders or
   prevents recognition of emergency signals, alarms, announcements, approach of vehicles,
   human speech, and the ability to determine the direction from which sounds are coming.
      4.3.1. DoD personnel while driving any vehicle on or off installations on official
      Government business are prohibited from text messaging, using cell phones, or using
      other hand-held electronic devices unless the vehicle is safely parked or they are using a
      hands-free device, except for receiving or placing calls in performance of duties from
      tactical or emergency vehicles or other mission-critical duties, to include law
      enforcement use of in-car mobile data terminals, mobile radios and other in-car electronic
      devices. Use of hands-free devices is also discouraged as creating significant distractions
      from safe driving performance.
      4.3.2. Off duty and Non-DoD personnel on the installation and its properties are
      prohibited from text messaging, using cell phones, or using other hand-held electronic
      devices while the vehicle is in operation, unless the vehicle is safely parked or they are
      using a hands-free device.
      4.3.3. The use of portable headphones, earphones, cellular phones, iPods, or other
      listening and entertainment devices (other than hearing aids) while walking, jogging,
      running, bicycling, skating, or skateboarding on roadways is prohibited. Using listening
      devices impairs recognition of emergency signals, alarms, announcements, approaching
      vehicles, human speech, and outside noise in general. EXCEPTION: Motorcycle helmet
      intercom system between operator and passenger is permitted.
   4.4. Detection devices. The use of radar or laser devices to indicate the presence of speed
   recording instruments or to transmit simulated erroneous speeds is prohibited on all
   Department of Defense installations as stated in Department of Defense Instruction 6055.4
   DoD Traffic Safety Program.
