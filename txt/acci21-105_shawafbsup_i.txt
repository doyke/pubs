  aircraft structural integrity or safety of flight/operation or are beyond the using organization’s
  capability to evaluate/repair, an aircraft structural maintenance specialist will be requested.
  3.13.4. Maintenance personnel who remove/install aircraft panels and doors must ensure
  seals are serviceable and sealant applied to panels and fasteners as specified in applicable
  aircraft technical orders.
  3.13.5. Maintenance personnel shall report all corrosion deficiencies through the CAMS
  IAW 00-20 series technical orders. Accurate documentation of maintenance actions in
  support of the corrosion control program is essential to support future manning, equipment
  requirements, training and parts/material procurement requirements.
  3.13.6. (Added-SHAWAFB) 20 MOS Plans and Scheduling will coordinate, at least
  monthly, all aircraft paint requirements through the Wing Corrosion Control Manager and
  effectively schedule coating repairs based on a “worst-is-first” scenario and prioritize coating
  repairs based on mission requirements.
  3.13.7. (Added-SHAWAFB) All coating evaluations of aircraft, Alternate Mission
  Equipment (AME), AGE, external fuel tanks, Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) pods and
  munitions trailers are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the worst condition based on
  coating failure and appearance. MXG goal is to maintain 80 percent of each end item at
  category 1 or 2.
  3.13.8. (Added-SHAWAFB) Wing Corrosion Control Manager will maintain status on
  fleet health and provide weekly status to Flight and Squadron supervision.
  3.13.9. (Added-SHAWAFB) All aircraft paint/coating repairs/requirements will be
  accomplished only in approved corrosion control facilities. Exception: 20 CES/CEV and
  Bio-Environmental must authorize/concur with all paint repairs to include static aircraft
  being conducted outside of approved facilities. All requests must first be coordinated
  through the Wing Corrosion Control Manager.
  3.13.10. (Added-SHAWAFB) Immediately upon aircraft full paint spraying operations
  within the corrosion control facility, notify EMS maintenance production supervisor of start
  date/time. EMS supervision will notify AMU, QA and MOC. The aircraft status will change
  to Non Mission Capable (NMC) at this time, aircraft is due weight and balance before flight.
  Immediately after any aircraft spray paint operations have halted, notify EMS supervision
  with start date/time of cure and calculate the final fly cure date/time.
  3.13.11. (Added-SHAWAFB) Any aircraft full paint will require aircraft weight and
  balance IAW T.O. 1F-16CM-5-2. Wing Corrosion Control Manager will ensure applicable
  aircraft forms are annotated after full paint and QA is notified. Aircraft paint touch ups/inlet
  lip repairs do not require weight and balance.
  3.13.12. (Added-SHAWAFB) Aircraft maintenance will not normally be performed on any
  aircraft within the aircraft paint facility during preparation for or undergoing coating repairs.
  MXG/CC approval is required prior to interrupting booth operations to perform maintenance
  on an aircraft within the paint facility.

 20                                           ACCI21-105_SHAWAFBSUP_I 13 JULY 2010


      3.13.18.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) AMUs will ensure fuel tanks are scheduled for paint
      on a "worst-is-first" basis and determine which units require re-painting.
3.14. Aerospace Vehicle Coating and Marking Requirements. This section implements the
policies outlined in AFI 21-105, Aerospace Equipment Structural Maintenance, and provides
guidance for applying command approved, non-USAF standard aircraft coatings and markings as
authorized in T.O. 1-1-8. Paint schemes/configurations and USAF standard aircraft markings
will be applied in accordance with TO 1-1-8 and the applicable aircraft technical order.
   3.14.1. Advanced Performance Coating. Advanced Performance Coating (APC) is the
   preferred topcoat unless mandated otherwise IAW weapon system specific technical data.
   This preferred coating system includes the appropriate Mil-PRF-23377 primer for bare metal
   uncovered during preparation, non-chromated tie coat material and an approved APC
   topcoat.
   3.14.2. Coating System Scoring and Maintenance. All ACC units are required to score
   aircraft coating systems to determine frequency of topcoat application. Fighter units should
   plan to scuff sand and overcoat the entire aircraft between depot cycles as necessary. Many
   fighter aircraft will require a complete overcoat at 36 months, but some may only require
   touch-up. All aircraft painting will be scheduled on a worst first basis to maintain coating
   system integrity and aircraft appearance. All aircraft coating systems except B-2, F-117 and
   F-22 will be evaluated/rated every 6 months for appearance/coating system integrity using
   applicable technical data or a locally developed system. The aircraft must be washed and
   clean prior to paint scoring. Supervisors will use ratings to determine corrosion
   treatment/paint scheduling priority. Units are required to adopt maintenance-painting
   techniques (i.e., spot painting and sectionalized painting as stated in T.O. 1-1-8) to maintain
   aircraft corrosion protection and appearance between overcoats. Partial painting “sections”
   of the aircraft will help reduce the effects of mottling and mismatch. Units should rotate
   Commander’s aircraft to prevent excessive paint build-up from too frequent over coating.
   Fully over coated aircraft will be documented in CAMS and the individual aircraft AFTO
   Form 95 for tracking purposes. Large aircraft units should rely on spot maintenance painting
   and sectionalized painting between depot cycles to maintain the coating system integrity.
   3.14.3. Aircraft Markings. Aircraft markings will be applied to aircraft as specifically
   authorized by HQ ACC, this instruction, T.O. 1-1-8, or the applicable aircraft technical order.
   Low observable aircraft markings not currently approved necessitates a waiver from HQ
   ACC/LGMS with System Program Directorate (SPD) approval due to strict survivability
   analysis requirements. Aircraft inputs to depot will be marked IAW with Air Force
   directives and this instruction only, unless otherwise approved by HQ ACC/LGM. HQ
   ACC/LGMS is the point of contact for aircraft painting and markings. HQ ACC/LGMS is
   also the point of contact for all AF unit designation markings. This listing can be found in
   Attachment 3 of this instruction. All aircraft markings and basic paint schemes will be
   maintained intact, legible and distinct in color. Command standardization of markings by
   mission design series (MDS) is of primary concern.
      3.14.3.1. Stenciling. Markings may be applied using stencils. Refer to T.O. 1-1-8 to
      determine the compatibility of stenciling paints, paint finishes and decal applications.
      3.14.3.2. Command Insignia. The application of the command insignia on aircraft is
      mandatory. The insignia will be applied to both sides of the vertical stabilizer unless
ACCI21-105_SHAWAFBSUP_I 13 JULY 2010                                                            21


     otherwise specified. Fighter type aircraft will use full color insignias and large aircraft
     (B-52, B-1, etc.) will use subdued insignias unless otherwise specified in Attachment 2.
     Size and location of command insignias by MDS are specified in Attachment 2.
     3.14.3.3. Organizational Insignia. The application of wing insignia is mandatory. The
     insignia will be applied to both sides of the forward fuselage. The operational squadron
     insignia may be applied on the left side in place of the wing insignia. Wing and squadron
     insignias will be the same color scheme as the command insignia, i.e., subdued for large
     aircraft and full color for fighter aircraft unless otherwise specified in Attachment 2.
     3.14.3.4. Distinctive Unit Aircraft Identification Marking. The application of the unit
     designator is mandatory for all ACC aircraft unless otherwise directed. HQ ACC/LGMS
     is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the assignment of unit designators. The
     primary factor used to determine appointment of unit designators is the aircraft/unit
     assignment location. TO 1-1-8 or the applicable aircraft TO will provide color
     restrictions for the unit designator. The unit designator will be applied in accordance
     with guidelines in Attachment 2 of this instruction.
     3.14.3.5. Tail Stripe. Tail stripes are applied as a wing option, used to identify aircraft
     operation squadrons. Each operations squadron will have a tail stripe unique to that
     squadron. The use of the same tail stripe by two or more squadrons within a wing is not
     permitted. The tail stripe will be applied at the upper portion of the vertical stabilizer,
     and must be in the form of a straight stripe. The width will not exceed 9 inches on fighter
     type aircraft and 15 inches on large aircraft. The stripe may be any color or pattern, and
     may contain a logo. On aircraft bearing the American Flag the tail stripe must be solid in
     color and will not contain any logo, name, or lettering. On aircraft with multiple vertical
     stabilizers, the tail stripe may be of either a wrap-around style on both vertical stabilizers
     or applied to the outboard sides of each vertical stabilizer.
     3.14.3.6. Aircrew And Crew Chief Names. Aircrew and crew chief/assistant names
     must be applied to all command aircraft, but must be removed prior to deployment from
     home station in direct combat zones or when participating in contingencies that may
     subject aircraft to hostile fire abroad.. Application of nicknames, punctuation, and/or call
     signs is not permitted. Style and size of letters are a unit option but will not exceed 3
     inches in height. All aircraft in the wing will be standard with the exception of the
     designated Commander's aircraft, which may have different lettering but will not exceed
     3 inches in height. A background block for pilot/crew chief names may be used. The
     block should be in contrasting color to the section of the aircraft where applied. To
     further an MDS theme, block may be preceded by a design depicting the MDS i.e. F-15
     eagle head, F-16 falcon head, etc. The name block should give a subdued appearance and
     may be other than rectangular in shape.
     3.14.3.7. Commander's Aircraft Markings. Commander's aircraft referred to in this
     instruction are those designated as Numbered Air Force (NAF), Wing, OG and
     commanders of flying squadrons (Bomber/Fighter). The NAF Commander may select
     one Wing within the command to have an aircraft specifically marked. It will be the only
     aircraft authorized so marked. Commanders are authorized only one aircraft each to be
     marked with standardized commander type markings. The following are markings
     authorized for use on Commander aircraft:
22                                          ACCI21-105_SHAWAFBSUP_I 13 JULY 2010


        3.14.3.7.1. Wing and/or NAF insignias on the right forward fuselage and a collage of
        assigned flight/operations squadron insignias on the left forward fuselage.
        3.14.3.7.2. Highlighting of unit designator and tail number. All highlighting will be
        done in contrasting gray, black or white as long as it meets primary basecoat gloss
        requirements e.g. gloss, camouflage or gunship. All unit designators and radio call
        numbers will remain on vertical stabilizers as depicted in applicable technical orders.
        3.14.3.7.3. Unit unique markings. This policy is provided to allow latitude for
        application of anniversary logo markings to Wing Commander aircraft. When
        applied, anniversary markings will not interfere with required aircraft markings and
        must be removed immediately after the anniversary period (1-year maximum).
        Waivers are not required for unit unique markings, however, Wing Commanders
        must approve the markings, and photographs must be provided to HQ ACC/LGMS
        for review and file. State flags and logos other than anniversary type are not
        considered unit unique markings. ACC/CC has designated ACC/PA as the
        clearinghouse for all requests to name ACC aircraft and must ultimately be approved
        by AF/CV. This includes markings previously considered unit unique and are
        community related/appreciation types such as “Spirit of,” “City of” and “State of.”
        Naming aircraft is a tradition designed to commemorate or honor individuals,
        geographic locations, or events either for the support provided the Air Force on a
        long-term basis, or because of its significance to Air Force history or heritage.
        Recommendations must include a proposed name, suggested aircraft and tail number,
        and detailed justification for the proposed name. Contact your wing Public Affairs
        office for details.
     3.14.3.8. Aircraft Travel Pods. Travel pods will be painted in gloss paint the same
     color as the aircraft with no additional markings. Units with multicolor aircraft should
     select one primary color of the aircraft for the travel pod. Travel pods designated for
     commanders may be any color and may contain the position and name of the individual
     and appropriate insignia. Lettering may be of any color and style, but shall not exceed 6
     inches in height. ACC demonstration teams have the option to paint travel pods gloss
     black and apply unique markings. The left side of pod will contain unit insignia and
     name and team emblem and name. The right side will contain the ACC insignia, the
     words Air Combat Command Demonstration Team and NAF insignia, if warranted.
     Commander and demonstration team travel pod paint scheme, final marking sizes, and
     placements will be approved by the WG/CC and documented within local unit operating
     instruction.
        3.14.3.8.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) One each travel pod and ladder for the 9 AF/CC,
        20 FW/CC, 20 OG/CC, 55 FS/CC, 77 FS/CC, and 79 FS/CC aircraft will have its
        own distinct paint scheme and will represent each organization to which it belongs.
        Viper East Demo Team will have three modified travel pods; one for each aircraft, all
        ladders are standardized on all three aircraft. Names and ranks of Commanders/Crew
        Chiefs are subject to change without additional approval. For standardization on the
        travel pods the door side is called right side opposite is left side, when looking at the
        door, forward is left and aft is right.
            3.14.3.8.1.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) 9th Air Force Commanders travel pod is

                             F-22 OUTER MOLD LINE AUDIT

A4.1. (ADDED) Aircraft Structural Maintenance (ASM) personnel will perform an F-22
Signature Assessment System (SAS) and aircraft Outer Mold Line (OML) audit to correlate
aircraft damage markings with defects in the SAS. A minimum of one audit per aircraft will be
completed each year by a Low Observable (LO) Section Supervisor proficient in OML
inspection. Scheduling aircraft for this audit will be accomplished during the monthly/weekly
shared resource scheduling meeting. All errors found during the audit must be accurately
reflected in Integrated Maintenance Information System (IMIS)/SAS and briefed to all LO
section personnel. Units must establish a local SAS management policy that outlines the
frequency of audits/QA evaluations necessary to ensure SAS data is accurate. Note: There is an
unacceptable risk to aircraft radar cross section/aircraft survivability from substandard
maintenance and/or inaccurate signature assessment system data inputs. A variety of aircraft
structural maintenance proficiency levels are performing LO maintenance and we must verify
that all work is completed IAW technical order data and documented properly in SAS.
A4.2. (ADDED) The following equipment is required to perform SAS margin audit:
   A4.2.1. (ADDED) Militope or Portable Maintenance Aid (PMA)
   A4.2.2. (ADDED) Sharpie
   A4.2.3. (ADDED) Pen or pencil
   A4.2.4. (ADDED) Fuselage station buttline chart
   A4.2.5. (ADDED) Roll of tape (blue 3M 2090)
   A4.2.6. (ADDED) Booties
A4.3. (ADDED) Steps to perform aircraft SAS margin audits:
   A4.3.1. (ADDED) Annotate aircraft margin for reference
   A4.3.2. (ADDED) Access priority screen
   A4.3.3. (ADDED) Highlight or circle all Logistics Control Numbers (LCNs) that are
   detailed in the priority screen on the LCN chart. Stand-alone LCNs are also annotated.
   Ensure seam filler LCNs are also annotated.
   A4.3.4. (ADDED) Access historical screen and compare each damage input of every
   highlighted/circled LCN with what is on the aircraft. If any differences in size, pay particular
   attention to existing damage for extended growth, if fuselage station or butt-line station are
   found, use the edit feature to correct and annotate action in supplemental data. Mark damage
   with a piece of blue 3M 2090 tape. This will make the following OML inspection easier.
   A4.3.5. (ADDED) If damage is not found on aircraft but reside in the historical, annotate
   for removal later. This scenario can be common due to previous facilitate other maintenance
   or repair actions.
   A4.3.6. (ADDED) Remove the LCNs that do not have associated damage on the aircraft by
   a brush/roll repair.

  A4.3.7. (ADDED) Annotate any damage found and also any marked damage that does not
  have the blue 3M 2090 tape on them. Sometimes damage is marked but does not get input
  into SAS. Input any new damage and any non-inputted damage found.
