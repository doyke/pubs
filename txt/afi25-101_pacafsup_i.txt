                                           Chapter 1

                                       WRM PROGRAM

1.1. WRM Basis:
   1.1.1. WRM comprises Service-owned resources positioned as either starter or swing stock,
   or a combination of both, to maximize worldwide warfighting capability. The AF WRM
   program links the positioning of resources with theater air campaigns via the component
   USAF War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4)/Wartime Aircraft Activity Report
   (WAAR). Using the starter/swing approach, components are authorized WRM consistent
   with WMP-4 activity for the approved force structure over the duration of the starter time
   period (see WMP-1, Annex E for specific time periods). Starter stocks are those assets
   required at or near the point of intended use until air and sea lines of communications (LOCs)
   are capable of sustaining operations. Swing stock is the total OPLAN/CONPLAN/Bomber
   forward operating locations (FOL) requirement minus the starter stock. Swing stocks are
   positioned to maximize flexibility to support multiple theaters. When inventory levels are
   insufficient to fully support requirements, AF/IL makes the final determination on where
   assets will be stored. WRM is based on wartime additive requirements sufficient to
   accomplish the Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) strategy.
   1.1.2. WRM is authorized for wartime. With proper approval/authorization and funding, it
   may be used for Small Scale Contingency (SSC), Noncombatant Evacuation Operation
   (NEO), steady state Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)
   exercises, and emergencies. The use of WRM should be contingent upon the impact on our
   ability to support the National Military Strategy. As a minimum, critical factors such as airlift
   cost, operational timeliness, other sources of support and the ability and timeliness of
   reconstituting WRM assets must be considered.
   1.1.3. Excess WRM assets may be retained in the overall AF inventory if approved as Future
   Force Expansion (FFE) or Contingency Retention Stocks (CRS). See WMP 1, Annex E, for
   qualification of WRM in this category. WRM retained under these categories will not be
   authorized replacement. USAF/ILG, in conjunction with Storing Commands, annually
   reviews the strategy supporting FFE and CRS equipment and the subsequent need for this
   equipment.
   1.1.4. Air Force units may use existing WRM assets with proper MAJCOM approval to
   support AEF taskings.
1.2. WRM Authorizations:
   1.2.1. WRM authorization source documents for OPLAN tasked WRM are the War
   Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO), War Plans Additive Requirements Report
   (WPARR), Vehicle Authorization List (VAL), Funded Level Rations Requirements (FLRR)
   letter, Inventory Management Plan (IMP), and Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)
   listings for BEAR, Fuels Mobility Support Equipment (FMSE) and Vehicles. Upon receipt of
   WRM authorization documents, the appropriate munitions activity will load the non-
   vehicular authorizations. Vehicular authorizations will be loaded into the appropriate vehicle
   management system by the MAJCOM vehicle activity using the approved VAL. For

     munitions, the Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) follows AF 21-101,
     Management and Maintenance of Non-nuclear Munitions, for WRM munitions management
     guidance. Recommendations to identify items that require special consideration in the WRM
     selection are submitted, with complete justification, through the appropriate MAJCOMs.
        1.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) AFI21-201,        Conventional      Munitions     Maintenance
        Management, should be referenced in para 1.2.1., vice AFI 21-101. This also applies to
        AFI 25-101, Attachment 1, page 103.
1.3. Physical Security and Classification Guidance:
     1.3.1. Determine appropriate physical security measures on the basis of local security threat
     assessments, storage facility configuration and the type of WRM stored. Cite specific
     Military Plans or applicable Security Classification Guides when classifying WRM items or
     information.
     1.3.2. On-hand quantities/inventory levels by themselves are UNCLASSIFIED when the
     following are not disclosed or discussed:
        1.3.2.1. References to a specific plan.
        1.3.2.2. Assessments of wartime requirements against on-hand quantities (base or
        theater) as it relates to specific warfighting capability (e.g., LOGFAC assessment of an
        OPlan).
        1.3.2.3. Theater starter time periods for war consumable non-munitions and munitions
        assets (See Non-nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA). Cite the Munitions
        Security Classification Guide when classifying munitions information).
        1.3.2.4. The units the stocks are intended to support.
        1.3.2.5. C-day for establishment of resupply.
     1.3.3. Cite the Material Management Division (HQ USAF/ILGM) as Originating
     Classification Authority (OCA) for guidance listed above.
     1.3.4. Originating Classification Authority is AF/ILG for any combination resulting in
     classification.
        CLASSIFIED BY:
        Director of Logistics Readiness
        DCS/Installations and Logistics
        REASON: 1.5(a) Military Plans DECLASSIFY ON: X-4
     1.3.5. The MAJCOM/Air Component War Reserve Materiel Officer (WRMO), War Reserve
     Materiel Non Commissioned Officer (WRMNCO), Supply and Munitions War Reserve
     Materiel Manager (WRMM) positions will be coded as requiring a TOP SECRET clearance.
        1.3.5.1. The installation level WRMO, WRMNCO, Supply and Munitions WRMM
        positions will be coded as requiring a SECRET clearance. The War Reserve Materiel
        Program Manager (WRMPM) will identify other installation WRMM functional
        positions security requirements.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                           9


      1.3.5.2. All individuals discussing WRM information via non-secure telephone/Non-
      secure Internet Protocol Network (NIPRNET) circuits are responsible for ensuring
      conversations and communications are limited to non-sensitive information. Secure
      telephone systems/Secure Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNET) must be used for
      discussion of any classified or sensitive information. Much of the required written
      coordination between agencies on WRM matters, though not specifically classified, is of
      possible intelligence value, especially when aggregated. Information of a sensitive nature
      (not otherwise classified) should be transmitted via unclassified encrypt for transmission
      only (EFTO) message as a minimum-security measure. Units not having this secure
      communications capability will use first class mail and applicable security procedures.
   1.3.6. WCDO and WPARR Classification:
   1.3.7. All WCDO products are subject to declassification according to Executive Order (EO)
   12958, Classified National Security Information, and 32 CFR. Part 2001, implementing
   directive for EO 12958; specifically, paragraph 1.6., Duration of Classification. The office of
   origin will be the Directorate of Operations and Training. The date of preparation will be the
   date used for controlling the WCDO. The WCDO is classified based on the classification for
   each line of activity in the WMP-4. The minimum classification for any WCDO extract
   (unit/base) is SECRET. Appropriate classification is controlled by program logic for both the
   standard and non-standard WCDO printed documents. Reasons for classification will be
   ―1.5a,g‖; refer to EO 12958, section 1.5, for a detailed description of the aforementioned
   reason. Declassification for these documents, at a minimum, will be marked ―X-Military
   Plans‖ or ―X3/4.‖ See EO 12958 for detailed explanation of the minimum markings.
      1.3.7.1. Pseudo-base codes (contained in the WCDO) or WRM base code (contained in
      the WPARR) is used to depict base locations. These codes can be accessed in Logistics
      Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) in the base cross-reference data. Pseudo-base
      codes (WCDO) and/or WRM base codes (WPARR) when associated with the actual
      location or Geographical/Base Location Code (GEOLOC) are classified. Consult specific
      classification guide for proper handling.
      1.3.7.2. Composition Codes (Comp Codes) are four-position, alphanumeric identification
      codes used to account for WRM equipment allocations under Allowance Standards (AS).
      Comp Codes by themselves are unclassified. Certain Comp Codes associated with
      unclassified allowance standard are unclassified. Comp Codes when associated with a
      classified allowance standard or Mission Design Series (MDS) are classified SECRET to
      prevent disclosure of wartime missions of specific bases reporting this WRM equipment.
1.4. WRM Outload Planning:
   1.4.1. WRM resources stored at an Alternate Storage Location requiring transportation to the
   Planned Operating Base will be identified in the applicable JOPES OPlan using existing
   WRM HFW-series and HHW-series UTCs in a ULN Force Record. In-place WRM UTCs
   will be also identified by ULN to indicate prepositioned WRM. Storing Commands will
   determine transportation mode. See paragraph 2.13.4.4 for responsibilities.
      1.4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The Command WRM Officer (CWRMO) will ensure all out
      load and in place requirements are loaded in Joint Operation Planning and Execution
      System (JOPES) by the appropriate WRM functional managers or Component Numbered
10                                        AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


     Air Force (CNAF) functional planners. Standard WRM Unit Type Codes (UTC) will be
     used to the maximum extent; however non-WRM UTCs will be used when a WRM UTC
     does not exist or deemed inadequate for the type/category of WRM requiring movement.
  1.4.2. Ensuring WRM wartime outload capability is a coordinated function between
  planning, storing/maintaining and transportation functions. The WRMO/NCO has overall
  responsibility to ensure this process is properly coordinated and briefed at the WRM Review
  Board.
  1.4.3. Units storing WRM must document movement/outload requirements (to include
  MAJCOMs centrally storing WRM) in the Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP). This information
  will include as a minimum the specifics on how WRM will be moved to the point of intended
  use to meet Contingency/Wartime taskings. Any problems will be addressed at the WRM
  Review Board, and if necessary, to the MAJCOM to help rectify. WRM capability should be
  incorporated into Part 1 of the ESP. For OPLAN tasked WRM, ensure outload criteria are
  commensurate with OPLAN timing and exercised as determined by the WRMPM. OPLAN
  criteria should be addressed in Part 2 of the ESP. Starter WRM not stored at the location of
  intended wartime use will be identified as Alternate Storage Location (ASL) assets.
     1.4.3.1. WRMO/NCO assesses starter stock assets at ASL for mission impact. The asset
     is identified to the applicable Command War Reserve Materiel Manager (CWRMM) for
     the plan(s) affected to ensure OPLAN/CONPLAN supportability. LIMFACs/shortfalls
     are identified through the ESP process.

110 regarding the JU of equipment against wartime usage, the WRMO/NCO must ensure the
following actions are accomplished:
   3.4.1. Include equipment and vehicles coded JU in the Expeditionary Support Plan.
   Minimum documentation includes type and quantity of equipment, registration or serial
   numbers, peacetime user, wartime user, the date (N, C, D) equipment is to be recalled from
   the peacetime user based on TPFDD arrival date of the wartime user, organizations
   responsible for recall, names or offices and phone numbers of personnel to be contacted to
   recall JU equipment, and assembly points/delivery destinations of recalled equipment.
      3.4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) In addition to the TPFDD, the WAAR must also be used to
      determine arrival of forces or to determine type of aircraft activity the WRM will support.

   base for use and cannot be recalled within 24 hours, the functional user will notify the
   WRMO/NCO. Replacement is not required if off-base use is only temporary, i.e., less than
   24 hours, or can be recalled in 24 hours.
   3.4.6. Out-of-Commission Joint Use Equipment. If JU equipment is expected to be out-of-
   commission for more than 30 days, the functional user will notify the WRMO/NCO. The
   functional user will also provide an estimated repair date and the date of repair.
   3.4.7. Changes to JU Status. When JU equipment status changes, the LRS Customer Service
   Element will notify the WRMO/NCO in writing. The WRMO/NCO, in turn, will ensure the
   change in status is briefed at the next WRM Review Board. The LRS Customer Service
   Element ensures all required AFMAN 23-110 actions are taken. When a WRM requirement
   is deleted for an item designated as JU and the peacetime support requirement continues to
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        39


  exist, convert the authorization records to an authorized/in-use detail record reflecting use
  code B/K.
  3.4.8. Recall of JU WRM Vehicles:
     3.4.8.1. The WRMO/NCO will direct a periodic (recommended semiannually) recall of
     JU WRM vehicles. Only vehicles coded joint-use on the VAL are subject to recall. If the
     wartime end-user and the peacetime end-user is the same, the vehicle is not recalled, but
     inspected during the unit surveillance visit. This recall may be conducted in conjunction
     with the surveillance visit of the Vehicle Management Flight.
     3.4.8.2. Vehicles recalled will be inspected for serviceability and safety. Vehicles should
     be released after inspection unless they do not meet inspection criteria. Those vehicles
     not passing the inspection must be turned into Vehicle Maintenance for corrective action.
     3.4.8.3. Vehicle Management Flight will note the time each organization is notified of
     recall. Any vehicle not delivered within two hours should be identified as an item for
     WRM Review Board discussion to determine whether recall coordination requires
     improvement or the vehicle is an unsatisfactory JU WRM candidate.
     3.4.8.4. Recalled vehicles not meeting safe serviceable shipment criteria IAW TO 36-1-
     191, Technical and Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance, will be
     identified in the exercise/inspection report and corrective action briefed to the WRM
     Review Board. User related discrepancies will be answered by the using organization
     Commander.

     of the LRS through the Vehicle Fleet Manager.
3.5. Excess WRM:
  3.5.1. Excess WRM should be redistributed to bases with WRM shortages whenever
  possible.
  3.5.2. WRM equipment (except vehicles) excesses will be released by the CWRMO to fill
  MAJCOM WRM shortages. If no shortages exist within the Command, offer the asset to the
  other MAJCOMs to fill their WRM shortages. Process excesses for redistribution/disposition
  instructions through the Item Manager.
  3.5.3. WRM consumable excess will be analyzed by the CWRMO to determine financial
  feasibility and criticality of movement to fill shortages within the MAJCOM. If no shortage
  exists within the MAJCOM and it is a critical item and financially feasible to redistribute,
  offer the excess to the other MAJCOMs. If no WRM shortages exist or it is not financially
  feasible to redistribute, absorb into primary operating stock. For critical WRM assets, the AF
  commodity manager must be notified.
  3.5.4. Second Destination Transportation (SDT) funding requirements are determined jointly
  by the CWRMO/NCO and WRMMs for equipment and non-munitions consumable assets.
  The requirement is passed to the Transportation function to be included in their budget
  submission, with a courtesy copy of the requirements provided to the WRMO/NCO.
     3.5.4.1. The MAJCOM Transportation function consolidates WRM SDT funding
     requirements and provides this information to HQ AFMC/FMBO.

                                         Chapter 4

                      WRM REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION

4.1. WRM Requirements Objective:
   4.1.1. WRM is pre-positioned based upon critical factors such as transportation constraints,
   operational timeliness, and cost. Consider these factors to determine total wartime
   requirements for a POB. Viewing this as a layered process, the first layer considers
   authorized primary operating stock (POS) for in-place forces. The second layer adds WRM
   pre-positioning requirements for wartime additive forces/missions documented in the WMP-
   4. The next layer is deployment assets requiring transportation, as defined in the OPLAN
   TPFDDs. Finally, deployment assets that cannot be delivered within the OPLAN required
   delivery date (RDD) are considered for pre-positioning as WRM. In summary, WRM and
   POS provide an interim operational capability that is augmented by deployment assets to
   provide a full operational capability. WRM requirements/authorization documents include
   WCDO, WPARR, VAL, P&N letter, IMP, FLRR letter. These are explained in further detail
   in this chapter.
4.2. War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO):
   4.2.1. The WCDO provides the WRM pre-positioning objective for consumables in support
   of Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) forces identified in the US Air Force WMP-4 (Wartime
   Aircraft Activity Report). All the major categories of war consumables are calculated using
   WCDO procedures, i.e., POL products, munitions and miscellaneous items (film,
   dropsondes, non-explosive chaff, rations, etc.).
   4.2.2. MAJCOMs will produce the WCDO authorizing WRM non-munitions/munitions
   consumables using the procedures contained in Chapter 8. Installation WCDO processing
   duties are contained in paragraph 8.6.
4.3. War Plans Additive Requirements Report (WPARR):
   4.3.1. The WPARR identifies and authorizes WRM in addition to POS and deployment
   assets (see Attachment 2, WPARR, Part One, format). Air Components, through their
   MAJCOM, use the WPARR to identify wartime additive requirements to support anticipated
   activity reflected in planning documents. The WPARR is compiled based on equipment
   authorizations in the Allowance Standards, support MRSP, and spares MRSP.
   4.3.2. The WPARR has two parts. Part I is used MAJCOM to MAJCOM to identify
   requirements by location. The WPARR, Part II consists of WPARR Part I requirements
   (using MAJCOM approved requirements) and the theater/Storing Command Base Operating
   Support (BOS) requirements to support incoming forces. MAJCOMs with theater
   planning/storage responsibilities (to include ANG) prepare the WPARR, Part II.
      4.3.2.1. WPARR, Part I Process: MAJCOMs will ensure assets included in deploying
      UTCs are not duplicated in WPARR submissions except as noted in paragraphs 4.3.3—
      4.3.7. MAJCOMs submit Part I of the WPARR NLT 1 Jun annually or more often as
      necessary (in conjunction with major WMP-4 revisions).
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                   45


     4.3.2.2. Using MAJCOM identifies/validates requirements and ensures items are
     contained in the applicable WRM Allowance Standard. Where possible, WRM UTCs
     will be used to identify Part I requirements. WRM UTCs are developed for Aviation
     Flightline Support Equipment (HF series), Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (HH
     series), and Materiel Handling Equipment (UF series) to facilitate logistics planning.
     4.3.2.3. During the requirements determination process the Using MAJCOM functional
     manager reviews current OPLAN TPFDD for shortfalls.
     4.3.2.4. Using MAJCOM functional manager forwards validated requirements to Using
     MAJCOM/LGX/LGS for review and consolidation into WPARR, Part I.
     4.3.2.5. Using CWRMO/NCO, in coordination with Command Equipment Management,
     submits the WPARR, Part I working copy to the storing CWRMO/NCO. The WPARR,
     Part I is not loaded into Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) until both
     Using MAJCOM and Storing Command concur with the requirements. The Using
     MAJCOM will forward WPARR, Part I directly to ANG/LGX for locations where the
     ANG is the installation host WRMO/NCO.
     4.3.2.6. Storing CWRMO/NCO submits the validated requirements to the applicable
     functional area CWRMMs for review.
     4.3.2.7. Storing CWRMMs resolves any requirement issues with the Using CWRMM.
     4.3.2.8. The Storing CWRMM            advises    the   Storing   CWRMO/NCO         of
     concurrence/disputed requirements.
     4.3.2.9. Storing CWRMO/NCO advises the Using CWRMO/NCO of concurrence or of
     any unresolved issues NLT 30 June.
     4.3.2.10. Using CWRMO/NCO will work all unresolved issues. Requirements that are
     not resolved by Using MAJCOM and Storing Command will be considered at an impasse
     and will be removed from the WPARR, Part I to publish the document on schedule.
     Work impasse items separately as out-of-cycle requirements.
     4.3.2.11. Using CWRMO/NCO will provide Storing CWRMO/NCO a new WPARR,
     Part I when unresolved issues are resolved. Using MAJCOM will load coordinated
     requirements into AFEMS resulting in the final WPARR, Part I. New Items identified as
     Additive Requirements will initially be listed on the WPARR as use code ―D.‖
     4.3.2.12. Storing Command will separate the final WPARR, Part I into equipment and
     vehicle requirements. The MAJCOM Supply function will approve the final WPARR,
     Part I equipment requirements in AFEMS, and MAJCOM Vehicle Management function
     will update final approved vehicle authorizations in the MAJCOM Automated Fleet
     Information System (MAFIS) Vehicle Authorization List using established practices.
  4.3.3. AFSOC WPARR requirements are not considered duplicative. AFSOC will identify
  worldwide WPARR requirements consistent with supporting current planning guidance.
  4.3.4. AMC is authorized to identify worldwide WPARR requirements consistent with
  supporting current planning guidance for global mobility taskforce support.

  4.3.5. ACC is authorized to identify WPARR requirements above UTC-based assets for the
  following weapons systems consistent with supporting current planning guidance: RC-135,
  E-8, E-4B, B-2, B-52, U-2, B-1, F-117, OA-10A, A-10A, F-16 C/D, F-15 C/D, and F-15E.
  4.3.6. PACAF and USAFE are authorized to identify WPARR requirements due to
  transportation shortfalls.
  4.3.7. AFMC is only authorized to identify WPARR, Part I requirements for aircraft battle
  damage repair (ABDR) trailers to support documented OPLAN activity.
  4.3.8. The WPARR, Part II consists of WPARR, Part I requirements (using MAJCOM-
  approved requirement) and the Theater/Storing Command BOS requirements to support
  incoming forces. Equipment changes to the WPARR are initiated through the Transaction
  Allowance Change Request (TACR) process in AFEMS. The WPARR will contain all
  equipment requirements to include vehicles. Vehicles are documented in the WPARR
  process to ensure all requirements are identified; however, the VAL process is used to
  authorize WRM vehicles. WPARR additive authorizations will be loaded into AFEMS by the
  MAJCOM Supply function. The MAJCOM Vehicle Management function will load vehicle
  authorizations in the VAL. Base vehicle authorizations will be loaded by the host base
  Logistics Readiness Squadron in the Registered Equipment Management System (REMS)
  using the MAJCOM VAL as the source document. Authorizations may be viewed through
  AFEMS viewing screen RWPR.
     4.3.8.1. The Storing CWRMO/NCO will provide the WPARR, Part Two, to the host
     installation with a letter of instruction to the WRMO/NCO NLT 15 August.
         4.3.8.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The base level WRMO/NCO in coordination with the
         Supply WRM will use the information in the letter of instruction to reconcile the new
         WPARR, Part II with SBSS records. The reconciliation process will be completed
         within the timeframe specified in the letter of instruction.
         4.3.8.1.2. (Added-PACAF) The host installation WRMO/NCO and WRMMs will
         convene a reconciliation meeting to address equipment and vehicle requirement
         changes. The WPARR, Part II will be reviewed and processed to include cataloging
         problems/challenges, excess/shortages, storage/maintenance issues, and updated use
         codes. The WRMO will track Issues and Action Items until resolved. Open items
         will be assigned get-well dates. WRMMs will provide weekly updates to the
         WRMO/NCO until all open items are closed. Significant issues and action items will
         be briefed at the WRM Review Board. The WRMO/NCO will publish meeting
         minutes and submit them within the timeframe specified in the letter of instruction
         along with the notification the reconciliation is complete.
            4.3.8.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Storing base Equipment Accountability Element
            (EAE) will review and compare new authorizations using R14/R23.

        records are prescribed in AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, Chap 26L.
     4.3.8.2. The host installation WRMO/NCO and WRMMs will convene a Joint Use
     meeting and have all actions completed within 30 days of receipt of the WPARR Part II
     Joint Use Determination Worksheet (Attachment 3) to include a copy of the JU meeting
     minutes forwarded to the host Command. MAJCOMs will determine JU procedures for
     vehicles. During the WRM JU meeting, WRMO/NCO and WRMMs will confirm that the
     vehicle can be JU. If JU of the vehicle is not feasible, the WRMO/NCO will forward a
     non-concurrence memo to the host Command CWRMO/NCO and Transportation
     function with rationale. If an initial authorization can be filled by a JU asset not
     previously identified, notify CWRMO/NCO and Transportation function. If an item is
     determined to be JU, provide the quantity to be JU, document number(s) of the assets to
     JU, and the peacetime allowance standard.
        4.3.8.2.1. (Added-PACAF) All Support (Use Code K) vehicles are candidates for
        JU. Upon receipt of the WPARR, Part II, the vehicle requirements will be compared
        with Use Code K vehicles on the VAL. Vehicles not filling a wartime requirement
        are candidates for JU (Use Code L) and will be recommended as such to the
        CWRMO and the PACAF Vehicle WRMM.
     4.3.8.3. Upon receipt of the JU meeting minutes, the Storing CWRMO/NCO will
     forward these JU requirements to the storing command supply function and vehicle
     management function. The Storing Command equipment management function will
     update the use code, ―C‖ in AFEMS for JU equipment, while the Storing Command
     vehicle management function will direct the host base to update the use code ―L‖ for JU
     vehicles in REMS. The LRS will update use code ―C‖ in SBSS for non-regionalized
     bases and RSS will update it for all regionalized bases.
     4.3.8.4. The Storing Command Equipment Management function will distribute the
     updated WPARR, Part II to the host base Logistics Readiness Squadron/Unit or Regional
     Supply Squadron. The Storing Command Vehicle Management function will distribute
     an updated VAL to the host base Logistics Readiness Squadron vehicle management
     function.
     4.3.8.5. Units should submit Transaction Allowance Change Requests for WRM
     equipment authorization changes to their parent MAJCOM utilizing AFEMS. MAJCOMs
     will include approved changes (approved for pre-positioning) in their WPARR
     submission. If an item is currently authorized in the WRM AS but is not in the WPARR,
     consult your parent MAJCOM for guidance. The WRM AS identifies the items required
     to support an MDS, but it does not mean an item is authorized for pre-positioning.
     Inclusion in the WPARR identifies that item as a requirement to pre-position.

  4.3.9. Joint Use:
     4.3.9.1. Joint Use equipment is equipment authorized to support a peacetime function
     that ceases to exist in wartime, thereby allowing the equipment to satisfy a wartime
     requirement. JU equipment can be used to satisfy WRM requirements versus ordering
     new equipment. All peacetime assets, to include those possessed by AF tenant units, are
     to be considered for JU application to wartime requirements by the installation.
     4.3.9.2. Upon receipt of the WPARR, Part II, the WRMO/NCO distributes a copy to the
     Supply and Transportation WRMMs. The Supply WRMM will identify all WPARR item
     National Stock Numbers and query AFEMS using the ACAL transaction to identify
     organizations on base possessing the same asset with use code ―B‖, ―C‖ and ―D‖ (use
     code ―A‖ equipment is not subject to JU). The Transportation WRMM will identify
     organizations on base possessing the same assets with ―K‖, ―L‖ and ―M‖ coded assets for
     verification/validation. The Supply and Transportation WRMMs will provide the listings
     with account custodian information to the WRMO/NCO. The WRMO/NCO will
     distribute the listings to the organizations possessing JU candidates.
     4.3.9.3. Affected organizations will make a JU determination prior to the JU meeting.
     4.3.9.4. The WRMO/NCO conducts/chairs the JU meeting. The WRM Supply POC, the
     Customer Service Element WRMM or monitor, the Vehicle WRMM, WRMNCO and
     representatives from all functional user organizations, including tenants/associates, who
     possess equipment to which JU could be applied, must attend the meeting. The following
     considerations may be made during your review:
         4.3.9.4.1. Review the new WPARR and identify changes to superseded versions.
         4.3.9.4.2. Review and validate peacetime equipment/vehicle authorizations (Use
         code ―B‖/‖K‖) that could be coded JU (Use code ―C‖/‖L‖) to satisfy WRM
         authorizations. Review and validate all equipment/vehicles already in JU status.
         4.3.9.4.3. Review other sources of equipment that could reduce WRM assets applied
         to WRM authorizations (e.g., commercial sourcing/leasing).
         4.3.9.4.4. JU WRM is not restricted to items of the same NSN, nomenclature, or
         type. Any item that performs the same function as the WRM item can be considered
         for JU.
     4.3.9.5. Determine any excess/shortage created by the new WPARR, Part II and
     document it in the minutes.
     4.3.9.6. Set suspense dates for all JU meeting action items to be completed. The
     WRMO/NCO will include open JU action items in the agenda of the next WRM Review
     Board.
     4.3.9.7. Units will provide substantiating rationale for not applying JU or not obtaining
     support from other sources.
     4.3.9.8. When a peacetime authorization for a support item designated as JU is deleted or
     reduced to a level where JU application is not practical and the WRM requirement
     continues to exist, take appropriate action to re-accomplish JU determination for that
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                       49


      asset. If JU cannot be applied, establish the WRM requirement authorized/in-use detail
      record reflecting use code ―D.‖
4.4. WRM Vehicle Requirements:
   4.4.1. WRM vehicles are generally limited to those functional and critical vehicles required
   to perform AF missions. All WRM vehicle requirements will be identified in the WPARR.
   The MAJCOM VAL is the source document for all vehicle authorizations. Storing
   Command vehicle functional managers will approve all authorizations for WRM.
   4.4.2. WRM vehicles not on the VAL, but reflected on the WPARR, Part II are provided for
   planning purposes only. Host Transportation function will determine how to support the
   WRM requirement and document the Expeditionary Support Plan, Transportation Annex
   accordingly. Vehicles must be available to support the WAA timing. Unsupportable
   requirements will be forwarded to MAJCOM Logistic Plans and Transportation as a
   shortfall. MAJCOM Transportation will determine how to support the requirement from
   Command resources or notify the Using MAJCOM to deploy the asset and update the ULN
   force record in the OPLAN TPFDD.
   4.4.3. General-purpose WRM vehicle requirements will be identified in the WPARR, but are
   only approved for inclusion in the Storing Command VAL by exception by the MAJCOM
   WRMPM. Storing Command functional managers will determine the supportability of
   general-purpose vehicles identified in the WPARR and Expeditionary Support Planning
   process. Functional managers will use joint use determination, commercial leasing, host
   nation support or other options to support requirements. WRM pre-positioning will be
   authorized by exception only. Certain contingency base oriented UTCs may include general
   purpose vehicles with the minimum number required pre-positioned as WRM to sustain
   operations at contingency locations where commercial or Host Nation provided resources are
   unavailable. General-purpose vehicles in these types of UTCs must be approved by the
   Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK) reporting MAJCOM LG (or
   equivalent) prior to the UTC being forwarded to AF/XOXW/ILGM for submission into the
   Type Unit Characteristics Data File (TUCHA) and registration of the UTC.
4.5. 463L System Support Equipment:
   4.5.1. 463L system pallets and nets used for unit deployment are no longer designated as
   WRM. See AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, for guidance and procedures
   for management of deployment 463L resources.
   4.5.2. 463L pallets and nets required for movement of WRM assets are designated as WRM.
   These assets are managed according to DoD 4500.9R, Volume VI, Management and Control
   of Intermodal Containers and System 463-L Equipment. These assets are stored and
   maintained by the unit storing WRM unless centralized storage has been approved by the
   WRMPM.
   4.5.3. WRM pallet and net authorization to support WRM movement will be listed in the
   applicable WRM Allowance Standard. WRM pallet and net authorizations will be loaded
   into AFEMS to enable visibility of authorizations. Authorization changes due to Logistics
   Detail (LOGDET) or Air Force Worldwide UTC Summary (AFWUS) tasking will be
   accomplished using a TACR.

      will be documented on the WPARR, Part II.
   4.5.5. HQ AMC determines Non-Unit Move (NUM) requirements (i.e., sustainment, mail,
   and Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)) for all NUM cargo originating at an AMC CONUS
   major Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE) for the first 90 days. HQ AMC submits these
   requirements directly to the AF item manager. Stand-by APOE requirements will be
   submitted to the AFMC pallet and net monitor.
   4.5.6. MAJCOMs will supplement this instruction with guidance to ensure RCS: MTC-DR
   (M&Q) 8701 reporting.
      4.5.6.1. (Added-PACAF) Global Asset Reporting Tool (GART) replaced RCS: MTC-
      DR (M&Q) 8701 reporting.
      4.5.6.2. (Added-PACAF) WRMMs will compute pallet and net requirements for
      movement of WRM and provide those requirements to their Unit Deployment Manager
      using guidance provided by the Installation Pallet and Net Monitor. An information copy
      will be provided to the WRMO/NCO.
      4.5.6.3. (Added-PACAF) 463L pallets and nets listed on the WPARR, Part II for
      BEAR will not be reported in GART. These pallets and nets are not part of the Air
      Mobility Command (AMC) operational pallet and net program. They are authorized
      IAW Allowance Standard 159. See AFI 25-101, para 7.2.2 for additional guidance.
4.6. Engines:
   4.6.1. Engines are not managed under the WRM program. See AFI 21-104, Selective

4.8. WRM Subsistence:
   4.8.1. Air Components with responsibility to a geographic Commander and MAJCOMs with
   WRM planning responsibilities determine subsistence requirements using the most current
   WMP-4 and OPLAN Time Phased Force Deployment Data. MAJCOM SVX will provide
   data to AF/ILVX using a population build, by day, by location, for each OPLAN. This data
   will be provided upon request from AF/ILVX or annually as determined by AF/ILVR. The
   most stringent theater CONPLAN can be used in lieu of an OPLAN for determining
   requirements. MAJCOM/SVX is responsible for determining total requirements with the
   assistance of the theater MAJCOM LGX (or equivalent).
      4.8.1.1. (Added-PACAF) PACAF/A1R, Services Functional Manager, is OPR for
      PACAF and the theater MAJCOM/LGX is HQ PACAF/A4X.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                           51


   4.8.2. MAJCOM functional managers compute rations requirements for their stand-alone
   units that are tasked by Air Force Worldwide UTC Summary to deploy with rations. These
   requirements will be sent to the MAJCOM SVX for transmittal to HQ AFSVA/SVOH.
   Supported theaters will identify to s those theater locations that require self-sustaining units
   to deploy with WRM rations supported by their home station. Supported theaters will provide
   s this information NLT 31 January of each year to allow s time to gather data to submit
   requirements to HQ AFSVA/SVOHF by 15 March of each year.
      4.8.2.1. (Added-PACAF) In para 4.8.2, replace the single ―s‖ with ―the supporting
      command‖.
   4.8.3. Commands will compute WRM rations requirements as follows:
      4.8.3.1. Aircrew requirements are computed by the CWRMO in LOGFAC and identified
      on the WCDO.
      4.8.3.2. Self-sustaining units are computed by functional managers and reported to
      MAJCOM Services.
   4.8.4. Requirements determination for subsistence computations is based upon WMP-1,
   Annex GG guidance. Computation may include three types of meals:
      4.8.4.1. Type 1R, (A Rations) meal requiring refrigeration and preparation.
      4.8.4.2. Type 1S, (Unitized Group Rations [UGR]) meal requiring food preparation but
      no refrigeration.
      4.8.4.3. Type 1C, (Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) or equivalent) meal requiring no food
      preparation or refrigeration.
   4.8.5. The installation host Services (SVS) officer manages the wartime subsistence program
   with the assistance of the host base WRMO.
      4.8.5.1. WRM rations are ordered, paid for, and owned by HQ AFSVA/SVOHF.
   4.8.6. Units with adequate dining facilities/contract service are authorized to substitute box
   lunches for aircrew MREs at the discretion of the Services Officer in coordination with the
   WRMO/NCO. If meals can be provided locally please notify Command/LGX by letter with
   justification so that MREs can be removed from your WCDO.
   4.8.7. Use of Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF): Reference WMP-1, Annex E for use of CRAF
   for movement of WRM subsistence.
   4.8.8. Subsistence is provided for the missile reconstitution force as well as missile crews.
   Rations stored at Launch Control Facilities will be the responsibility of the facility manager.
   The facility manager will provide the WRMO/NCO with the results of the facility inspection.
   This report must contain the quantity of rations on-hand, condition, and shelf life expiration
   date.
4.9. Non-nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA), Munitions Requirements: The

                    MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, AND MARKING

5.1. WRM Storage Objectives:
   5.1.1. Maintain WRM to ensure readiness for any authorized contingency. WRM should be
   maintained by organizations possessing similar assets to ensure technical competence and
   familiarity with asset storage and maintenance requirements. Organizations managing
   contract maintenance of WRM are responsible to ensure the condition and readiness of the
   WRM assets. Table 5.1 below outlines the general organizational responsibilities for
   maintaining WRM. The table is not directive, but outlines customary responsibilities.

5.2. WRM Maintenance:
  5.2.1. Identify WRM maintenance requirements through inspections or scheduling in
  accordance with applicable Technical Orders or equivalent technical guidance. Workcards
  provide primary inspection criteria.
  5.2.2. Establish maintenance priorities consistent with other non-WRM assets to include
  corrosion control, maintenance planning and scheduling, Time Compliance Technical Order
  compliance, appropriate priority for requisitioning repair parts (i.e., if the end item has a
  MICAP reportable standard reporting designator [SRD] and is on the Command Mission
  Essential Level [MEL], Urgency Justification Code of 1G or JG is appropriate) and
  maintaining required records and forms.
  5.2.3. Inspection and Maintenance Intervals:
     5.2.3.1. WRM is inspected annually based on the following: assets without a technical
     order, or specified inspection interval are inspected to include serviceability verification,
     based on a random sampling of at least 25% of each category of WRM items. Centrally
     stored WRM can be inspected to coincide with other functional requirements such as
     supply inventory inspections, or at an interval and percentage approved by the CWRMO.
     Increase frequency if climatic or environmental conditions require it. HQ AFMC/LGMW
     ensures assets stored at Army depots are properly stored, inspected, and maintained.
         5.2.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Assets will be inspected IAW end-item technical orders
         or equivalent technical guidance provided by the manufacturer. When maintenance
         of asset is accomplished through contract services, the Performance Work Statement
         (PWS) will include appropriate technical order or guidance language on inspection
         criteria.
     5.2.3.2. Initial acceptance inspections are conducted within 60 calendar days of asset
     receipt and documented on the appropriate form or in the supporting automated system.
         5.2.3.2.1. The 60-day inspection requirement does not apply to Buy-By-Set
         deliveries. In lieu of 60 days, each unit will have up to 120 days to accept, inspect,
         inventory and store a BEAR set. Waivers to exceed the 120-day rule will be granted
         by AF/ILGM on a case-by-case basis.
     5.2.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Monthly Walk-Through Inspection: A monthly walk-through
     inspection will be performed by the storing organization’s WRMM or by contractor
     personnel when services are contracted and specified in the Contract Performance Work
     Statement (PWS). The walk-through inspection will identify damaged containers,
     missing assets, or circumstances resulting in deteriorated storage capability that require
     immediate corrective action. As a minimum, walk-through inspections will include the
     following:
         5.2.3.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Physical damage
         5.2.3.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Visible corrosion
         5.2.3.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Proper storage
         5.2.3.3.4. (Added-PACAF) Missing protective covers
         5.2.3.3.5. (Added-PACAF) Missing hardware (filler caps, bolts, etc.)
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         55


        5.2.3.3.6. (Added-PACAF) Complete/legible condition tags
        5.2.3.3.7. (Added-PACAF) Verify quantity and nomenclature against supporting
        documents (WPARR, WCDO, R07, R14, etc.).
        5.2.3.3.8. (Added-PACAF) Identify excess
        5.2.3.3.9. (Added-PACAF) Monitor shelf life items.
        5.2.3.3.10. (Added-PACAF) Detailed report identifying commodities inspected,
        including discrepancies and corrective action taken. Discrepancies not corrected on
        the spot will be identified to the WRMO/WRMNCO no later than the 5th of each
        month.
  5.2.4. WRM Vehicles Maintenance:
     5.2.4.1. Rotate WRM vehicles with active fleet vehicles, where possible, to ensure the
     maximum degree of WRM fleet serviceability. Do not place vehicles in replacement code
     status A through J into WRM. The Storing Command will develop WRM vehicle rotation
     policy and ensure bases formulate a rotation plan designed to equalize use of like
     vehicles. Vehicles being rotated into or out of storage must be in TO 36-1-191 condition
     and current on all inspections.
     5.2.4.2. To the maximum extent possible, integrate special purpose (i.e. aircraft refuelers,
     ambulances, crash rescue fire fighting vehicles, etc.) and Material Handling Equipment
     vehicular assets with POS to ensure serviceability. Use special purpose or tactical
     vehicles that do not have a peacetime role, or that receive limited peacetime use, to
     ensure their serviceability. Units may also integrate de-icing trucks, latrine servicing
     trucks, Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Liquid Nitrogen (LIN) servicing units with peacetime
     units to ensure serviceability. Integrated assets will be properly marked IAW paragraph
     5.3.7.
        5.2.4.2.1. Integration requests will be sent from the using organizational Commander
        to the WRMO/NCO. The WRMPM will approve/disapprove integration of pure
        WRM assets. These letters will be kept on file by the WRMO/NCO.
        5.2.4.2.2. Quarterly, mid-month Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct, the WRMO/NCO should request a
        utilization report for integrated vehicles, and comparative analysis of integrated
        WRM vehicle utilization to like assets within the assigned organizations, from the
        servicing Vehicle Management and Analysis section. The analysis should be used by
        the WRMO/NCO to identify potential excessive use of WRM vehicles as compared
        to use of like peacetime operating stock assets within the assigned organizations, and
        to identify instances where WRM vehicles are solely used in lieu of peacetime
        operating stock vehicles. Instances where it is perceived integrated WRM vehicles are
        being used excessively that cannot be resolved at the installation level with be
        forwarded to the MAJCOM WRM and Vehicle staffs for joint resolution.
     5.2.4.3. Maintenance management of WRM vehicles must comply with the policies and
     procedures in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management, and TO 36-1-191, Technical and
     Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance. Do not place vehicles in WRM
     without repairing them according to approved procedures. Do not place vehicles in WRM

       storage while the vehicle warranty is valid if a POS requirement exists at the storage
       location.
          5.2.4.3.1. Vehicle maintenance scheduling, priorities and inspection will be
          established and accomplished IAW TO 36-1-191 and AFI 24-302, respectively.
              5.2.4.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management is obsolete.
              Use AFI 23-302, Vehicle Management. 5.2.5.1.1. (Added) To the maximum
              extent possible, integrate cryogenics (e.g., liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen)
              servicing units with peacetime units to ensure serviceability. Integrated
              equipment will be properly marked IAW paragraph 5.3.7. Other support
              equipment will not be integrated for use with peacetime support equipment.
       5.2.4.4. JU vehicles recalled will be inspected for serviceability and safety. Vehicles
       should be released after inspection unless they do not meet inspection criteria. Those
       vehicles not passing the inspection must be turned into Vehicle Management for
       corrective action.
   5.2.5. WRM Support Equipment Maintenance:
       5.2.5.1. Support equipment will not be integrated for use with peacetime support
       equipment (except as designated in 5.2.4.2). It will be operated to extend the service life
       and maintain its readiness. The level/frequency of use will be set by the Air Staff
       functional manager to ensure readiness. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) (CAMS
       and GO81) will be used to monitor readiness status.
       5.2.5.2. There are three levels of inspection for WRM support equipment: visual,
       serviceability, and TO compliance.
          5.2.5.2.1. Visually inspect WRM equipment quarterly. Open containers to allow
          inspection. Inspections can be done as part of the WRM surveillance visit described
          in Chapter 3, during ORIs, UCIs, etc., or by the custodian, WRMM, or program
          element manager. All assets should be checked during each condition inspection;
          however, 25 percent is the minimum inspection requirement. Inspections will be
          documented in MIS and on appropriate equipment maintenance forms (e.g., AFTO
          Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record). Assets with discrepancies will be
          scheduled for maintenance.

NOTE: Chaff crates and containers only need to be opened if visual damage is apparent or the
barrier paper is wet or torn, in which case specific inspection requirements in TO 12P3-1-8,
Inspection Procedures--All RR/AL Chaff (Non Pyrotechnic), will be followed.
          5.2.5.2.2. Perform WRM serviceability inspections annually. WRM equipment will
          be mechanically/electrically tested, as applicable, to ensure they are ready to perform
          their wartime mission. Serviceability inspections will be done by the functional user
          or by the base function that has the capability to perform them.
       5.2.5.3. Powered AGE.
          5.2.5.3.1. The term Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) is defined in TO 00-20-1,
          Aerospace Equipment Maintenance General Policies and Procedures. Joint use
          WRM AGE will be maintained IAW specific equipment technical orders and work
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                    57


        cards. When AGE is designated as pure WRM, perform all inspections prior to
        storage. When WRM equipment is placed in storage, comply with inspection
        requirements in TO 35-1-4, Processing and Inspection of Support Equipment for
        Storage and Shipment, in lieu of calendar inspections. While stored outside, inspect
        AGE at 18-month intervals; while stored inside, inspect at 24-month intervals; while
        stored in climatically controlled environments, inspect at 36-month intervals.
        Qualified maintenance technicians will perform servicing inspections, functional
        checks, load checks (as applicable), and minor corrosion control treatment on
        serviceable powered AGE every 180 days. Load checks on flightline diesel engine
        generator sets are to be sustained for a minimum of 15 minutes. Periodic inspections
        will be accomplished IAW above guidance and TO 00-20-1, chapter 7, following the
        guidance for annual inspections contained in the applicable Air Force periodic
        inspection workcards. In those areas where weather or storage condition have a
        deteriorating effect on powered AGE, or when circuitry load checks on weapon
        systems are beyond normal static run-up procedures, the applicable equipment item
        will be dispatched for a period not to exceed 24 hours to complete the functional
        check. Such dispatch will be accomplished based on a written schedule from the AGE
        WRMM and approved by the WRMPM.
        5.2.5.3.2. (Added-PACAF) WRM Powered-AGE will be inspected and maintained
        IAW specific equipment technical orders and work cards. This includes scheduled
        inspection intervals and inspection/maintenance criteria. Additionally, qualified
        maintenance technicians will perform functional checks, load checks (as applicable),
        and minor corrosion control treatment on serviceable powered-AGE every 90 days.
        Load checks on flight line generator sets must be sustained for a minimum of 15
        minutes.
        5.2.5.3.3. (Added-PACAF) At local discretion, assigned powered AGE WRM can
        be rotated with like daily-use AGE. When this option is exercised, the swapped
        pieces of WRM AGE and daily-use AGE must be fully serviceable and in like
        condition.
     5.2.5.4. Nonpowered AGE.
        5.2.5.4.1. JU Nonpowered AGE will be maintained IAW specific equipment
        technical orders and work cards. When Nonpowered AGE is designated as pure
        WRM, perform all inspections prior to storage. When WRM equipment is placed in
        storage, comply with inspection requirements in TO 35-1-4 in lieu of calendar
        inspections. While stored outside, inspect AGE at 18-month intervals; while stored
        inside, inspect at 24-month intervals; while stored in climate-controlled
        environments, inspect at 36-month intervals. Periodic inspections will be
        accomplished IAW above guidance and TO 00-20-1, chapter 7, following the
        guidance for annual inspections contained in the applicable Air Force periodic
        inspection workcards. Functional checks and minor corrosion treatment will be
        accomplished every 180 days. If equipment is stored outside, more frequent
        inspections may be necessary based on weather conditions, equipment condition,
        and/or equipment configuration.
58                                        AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


        5.2.5.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Non-powered WRM AGE will be inspected and
        maintained IAW specific equipment technical orders and work cards. This includes
        inspection intervals and inspection/maintenance criteria. Additionally, functional
        checks and minor corrosion control treatment will be accomplished by qualified
        personnel, every 90 days.
        5.2.5.4.3. (Added-PACAF) At local discretion, assigned non-powered WRM AGE
        can be rotated with like daily-use AGE. When this option is exercised, the swapped
        pieces of WRM AGE and daily-use AGE must be fully serviceable and in like
        condition.
     5.2.5.5. Fire Extinguishers. The installation fire department will ensure records are
     maintained on WRM fire extinguishers. The records will list the extinguisher by type,
     serial number, location, maintenance, hydrostatic test due dates, date of last inspection,
     and name of inspector. AF IMT 1071, Inspection/Maintenance Record, or automated
     methods will be used to document the above information. Applicable directives on the
     inspection of fire extinguishers are: NFPA Standard #10 (portable fire extinguishers);
     13F4-401 and 13F4-4-111 (wheeled HALON 1211 type units); and appropriate
     manufacturers brochures on portable hand type Halon, Dry Chemical, and Water Fire
     Extinguishers.
  5.2.6. Aircraft External Fuel Tanks:
     5.2.6.1. Inspection Intervals and Procedures (Built-up Tanks). The inspection interval for
     built-up tanks is related to their storage location. Inspection intervals for WRM built-up
     tanks can be found in applicable 6J14 series Technical Order. As a minimum, monthly
     walk-through inspection of tank storage areas will be conducted. The monthly walk-
     through will inspect for damaged assets, shipping/storage containers, and
     missing/damaged protective coverings. Fuel tanks will be stored only in approved
     shipping/storage containers according to TO 00-85A-03-1, Preservation, Packaging and
     Packing--External Aircraft Fuel Tanks/Cells. Discrepancies found during a walk-through
     will be corrected immediately or scheduled for maintenance.
     5.2.6.2. The ―next inspection‖ block of the condition tag (DD Form 1574) shows the
     month/year the tank will be scheduled based on the method the tank is stored and the data
     appearing in the ―inspected by/date block‖ on the tag. Units will develop a program to
     monitor/track the inspection interval of WRM tanks to include a procedure for reporting
     tank status. When the method of storage for built-up tanks changes, there will be a
     corresponding change in the maintenance interval. Annotate this change on the report
     developed and used for the locally designed program to track inspection intervals. If a
     change in storage improves the protection of the tanks, the condition tag and the locally
     developed report will remain the same. This criterion applies due to the tanks being
     subjected to the outside environment. The period of exposure is irrelevant. If the change
     in the method of storage decreases the protection for the tanks, the condition tag and the
     locally developed report will be changed to reflect the earliest inspection due date.
     5.2.6.3. Since cannistered tanks are not processed through maintenance on a periodic
     basis, the ―next inspection due‖ column on the locally designed report for cannistered
     tanks will indicate, for example, 202 (2nd quarter required and CY 2002).
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                      59


     5.2.6.4. WRM built-up tanks will be inspected for condition of serviceability IAW
     applicable 6J14 series TO. Tanks will be prepared for storage according to TO 0085A-
     03-1.
     5.2.6.5. Built-up tanks will be included in the base corrosion control program and
     maintenance/inspections will be based on the storage and climatic conditions (TO 1-1-
     691, Aircraft Weapons Systems--Cleaning and Corrosion Control) to which the tanks are
     subjected.
     5.2.6.6. Inspection Intervals and Procedures (Cannistered Tanks). Cannistered tanks will
     not be processed into maintenance on a scheduled periodic basis except when canisters
     are scheduled for corrosion control treatment. During the monthly walk-through
     inspection, canisters will be inspected for pink or white humidity indicators, excessive
     corrosion, and punctures. Canisters found in this condition will be scheduled for
     maintenance. Canisters will also be scheduled into maintenance when contents are
     required to be built-up.
     5.2.6.7. With respect to corrosion control and maintenance, canisters will be given the
     same priority as built-up tanks. Canisters will be prepared for storage and inspected
     according to TO 0085A-03-1. Corrosion control and maintenance will be performed on
     those canisters deteriorated to the point where moisture could damage the tanks or result
     in having to build-up the tanks.
  5.2.7. (Added-PACAF) Racks, adapters, and pylons (RAP), Guns, Gun Barrels, and
  Components. The unit Armament Systems Superintendent, WRMM, or RAP Weapons QAE
  (through contract surveillance) share the responsibility with Supply to ensure all required
  maintenance actions are accomplished on assigned assets in a timely manner to meet
  Operational Plan (OPLAN) tasking. All references to guns in this paragraph include guns,
  barrels, and other gun components. Qualified maintenance technicians will inspect and repair
  these WRM consumables according to applicable T.O.s and this instruction. The Armament
  Superintendent, WRMM, or Weapons QAE (through contract surveillance) along with
  Supply will ensure required Technical Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO), maintenance
  actions, supply discipline, annual budget and quarterly WRM unfunded requirement
  submission processes are in-place to support maintenance of assigned assets. RAP WRMMs
  and Weapons QAE will review and have a working knowledge of the WCDO and how RAP
  assets support applicable OPLANs. Personnel responsible for maintaining RAP and gun
  assets or performing surveillance on contracted maintenance will ensure the following:
     5.2.7.1. (Added-PACAF) Scheduling procedures. A report will be used for scheduling
     WRM equipment for maintenance. Scheduling will include identification of quarterly
     maintenance requirements by item type, serial number, storage location, and
     configuration. The quarterly schedule will be used to develop maintenance plans. These
     plans will include assets due inspection/maintenance during that period; assets scheduled
     in a previous period but not accomplished; unscheduled requirements; and requirements
     based on walk-through inspections.         Scheduling will include corrosion control
     requirements, procedures for the flow of assets through the maintenance cycle, pickup
     and delivery schedules, coordination requirements, timing, forms to be used, tagging
     procedures, and assignment of OPRs for each task.

        or date of receipt (if the manufacture date is unknown) ensure the assets are evenly
        flowed into the maintenance/inspection cycle.
     5.2.7.2. (Added-PACAF) Status Reporting procedures. Supply and the WRMO will be
     informed on a monthly basis or more often if necessary, of the number of inspections
     scheduled, completed on schedule, and any problem areas. Additional status reporting
     requirements are:
        5.2.7.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Submit a monthly asset serviceability report to your
        WRM NAF Functional area, through the WRMO/WRMNCO for submission to the
        PACAF Functional Manager and the CWRMO. This report must include:
        Nomenclature (NOUN), National Stock Number (NSN), Quantity (QTY) on hand and
        authorized, open maintenance actions (i.e., TCTOs/one time inspection (OTI)), cost
        value of items, condition of the item and status (parts on order, off-base requisition
        number, estimate delivery date of shipment and follow-up action), and remarks.
        5.2.7.2.2. (Added-PACAF) The NAF RAP WRMM will provide a standardized
        reporting documentation format and approve any local forms used.
     5.2.7.3. (Added-PACAF) TCTO Procedures. Accomplish TCTOs during the normal

        5.2.7.4.3. (Added-PACAF) RAP and Guns will be removed from barrier paper and
        inspected at least once every 10 years using a cycle of 10% per year (EXCEPTION:
        If containers have been damaged, deteriorated, or damage to contents is suspected,
        contents will be inspected immediately). Special emphasis will be placed on the
        following:
           5.2.7.4.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Ensure WRM barrels are inspected upon initial
           acceptance and sealed in barrier paper together with desiccant.
           5.2.7.4.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Ensure DD Form 1574 is correctly annotated.
           Care must be taken to ensure entries such as condition, status code, NSN, part
           number, date next inspection due, etc., are annotated. The current TCTO status
           will be reflected in the remarks block of the DD Form 1574.
           5.2.7.4.3.3. (Added-PACAF) An annotated DD Form 1574 will be secured to
           the asset and another completed DD Form 1574 will be affixed to the outside of

           availability of required accessories to conform to OPLAN requirements (e.g., a
           Triple Ejection Rack (TER) must have required sway brace pads and lugs).
           5.2.7.4.3.7. (Added-PACAF) Required accessories not installed on the asset
           will be sealed in a waterproof package and stored in the same container with the
 62                                         AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


              asset but outside of the barrier paper (i.e., TER rocket cables, Bomb Rack Unit
              (BRU)-57 munitions interface cables). Note: Sensing switch guards will not be
              installed on TERs.
      5.2.7.5. (Added-PACAF) RAP packing guidance. All RAP WRM assets will be stored
      in wooden crates. Cardboard boxes are not conducive for long-term storage and will not
      be used. Before sealing RAP, guns, barrels and gun components in barrier paper and
      placing in the appropriate container, the following needs to be accomplished:
          5.2.7.5.1. (Added-PACAF) Desiccant will be placed with the asset per the item TO,
          Specialized Packing Instruction (SPI), or other direction as applicable.
          5.2.7.5.2. (Added-PACAF) Humidity indicator will be packed with each asset and
          secured with tape.
      5.2.7.6. (Added-PACAF) Organizations responsible for maintaining RAP and gun
      assets will develop an extensive IPI listing and a means of training, validating and
      documenting In-Progress Inspections.
      5.2.7.7. (Added-PACAF) RAP Maintenance and Supply will convene at least monthly
      to review the Repair Cycle Asset management list (D23).
5.3. WRM Storage Objectives:
   5.3.1. WRM assets will be primarily stored at the wartime POB. If storage shortfalls exist at
   the POB, or if storage is unavailable/inaccessible at the POB, WRM will be stored at an
   alternate storage location (ASL). Alternate storage locations are determined in the following
   priority sequence: storage at an Air Force or DoD installation through a support agreement,
   host nation support (HNS), local contract storage (except munitions) or centrally stored.
      5.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) RAP/Guns/Gun Components will be stored in covered, four-
      sided storage. In addition, guns and gun components will be stored in secure storage
      areas IAW AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Program, DoD 4145.19-R-1, Storage
      and Materials Handling, and AFMAN 23-110.
   5.3.2. WRM is stored and marked to achieve and maintain a continuous state of readiness,
   and to make assets readily identifiable and to prevent inadvertent use. Additionally, WRM
   must be brought out of stored configuration and be ready to use at the POB or ready to
   transport from the ASL to the POB to support the timing established in the wartime aircraft
   activity.
   5.3.3. Storing activities must be able to store, and perform scheduled rotations, inspection
   intervals, and required maintenance. Local capabilities must be assessed to ensure adequate
   support can be provided. Storing activities must address shortfalls to the Storing Command
   so that support can be arranged or an ASL designated to meet WRM storage requirements.
   5.3.4. Storage Methods:
      5.3.4.1. Commands, through the storing activity, ensure WRM is stored efficiently and
      effectively to maximize asset serviceability with available resources. WRM is stored in
      descending preferential order: climate-controlled facilities, non-climate controlled inside
      facilities, outside covered storage, or outside uncovered storage. Ensure security is
      configured on basis of storage facility configuration, type WRM stored, and local threat.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         63


     5.3.4.2. When dedicated storage is not feasible or available, store WRM as outlined
     below:
         5.3.4.2.1. Commingle consumable WRM assets with POS including bulk storage.
         When assets are commingled, ensure shelf life coded items are identified and use a
         bin label, placard, or other means available to clearly identify the WRM level.
         5.3.4.2.2. Segregate WRM equipment, when storing with like equipment. Where
         WRM is stored together with similar assets, mark pure WRM IAW paragraph 5.3.7.
         5.3.4.2.3. Integrated equipment, such as aircraft refuelers, ambulances, crash and fire
         vehicles, and all materiel handling equipment are mixed with the storing installation
         vehicle fleet so that the refueling, agent dispensing, and hydraulic mechanisms can be
         exercised to ensure serviceability. Integrated assets will be marked with a WRM
         triangle.
     5.3.4.3. Long-term storage is encouraged when the WRM can be generated to full
     serviceability by the Storing Command maintenance activity. Command approval is
     required for all long-term storage requests and adjustments to maintenance intervals.
     Commands will develop inspection programs for assets centrally stored in long-term
     storage.
  5.3.5. Storage Shortfalls/Facility Management.
     5.3.5.1. Storage shortfalls associated with WRM pre-positioning requirements will be
     identified by the storing functional activity to the host Civil Engineer Squadron Real
     Estate Branch for resolution IAW AFI 32-9002, Chapter 2.1, Use of Real Property
     Facilities. At non-Air Force locations, follow the host service directive. If local storage
     capabilities are inadequate, ensure the WRMPM (through the WRMO/NCO) is
     knowledgeable of WRM storage shortfalls and efforts to correct the deficiency. The
     storing activity must consider programming for new storage facilities through the Civil
     Engineer Squadron.
     5.3.5.2. Determine whether WPARR, Part II additions create a storage shortfall.
     5.3.5.3. After all local capabilities have been exhausted, identify storage shortfalls to
     Storing Command/CE and inform the CWRMO.
  5.3.6. WRM Storage Funding: WRM storage expenses will be budgeted in the storing
  activity’s WRM Financial Plan. The Storing Command will ensure storage funding is
  programmed in the POM. WRM Funds can be expended for long-term storage supplies and
  equipment. See Chapter 3 for more specific details on funding.
  5.3.7. WRM Marking:
     5.3.7.1. Mark all pure WRM equipment (use code ―D‖) and vehicles (use code "M‖)
     with a solid black triangle. Markings must be of an appropriate size in relation to the size
     of equipment item being marked. See Attachment 5 for rules to enhance WRM marking.
     5.3.7.2. WRM munitions and bulk petroleum products are exempt from WRM marking.
     5.3.7.3. Marking of WRM commodities other than equipment:
 64                                         AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


          5.3.7.3.1. Use a bin label (R/D38/GV837, Ref. AFM 23-110, Vol. II, Part Two,
          Chapter 6, Attachment B-38) and placard to mark consumables. The sign or placard
          will include the solid black triangle and the statement "WRM - DO NOT ISSUE
          BELOW (indicate WRM level from WCDO).‖
          5.3.7.3.2. For the purpose of WRM marking, a sign is defined as a freestanding
          informational marker affixed to a post, pole, stake, or stanchion. A placard is an
          informational marker attached or affixed to an item, group of items, or facility.
          Materials used for signs and placards will be durable to reduce frequent replacement
          due to fair wear and tear and exposure to the weather. Use a sign that is easily viewed
          and comparable in size to the asset stored (use common sense).
      5.3.7.4. WRM commodities will be marked with an appropriate identification/condition
      tag (when applicable).
      5.3.7.5. As equipment items are removed from WRM status, change the use codes and
      immediately remove the WRM triangular markings.
5.4. (Added-PACAF) Maintenance Quality Assurance.
   5.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Each maintenance activity with a quality control function will
   ensure quality control/assurance personnel inspect and evaluate their programs IAW AFI 21-
   101, AFI 25-101, this supplement and any other instructions, manuals, TO, etc., that governs
   their program. The following will be included in the maintenance QAE program:
      5.4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Observe maintenance exercises such as Tanks, RAP or
      munitions build-up exercises and provide written comments.
      5.4.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Assist the WRMO during WRM surveillance visits.
      5.4.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Review technical orders/TCTO program for compliance with
      established standard.
      5.4.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Route quality control reports or QAE end of month
      surveillance summary and Monthly Activity Report covering WRM through the
      applicable, WRMM, WRMO and WRMPM and to the NAF Functional Managers.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        65


                                          Chapter 6

                                       USE OF WRM

6.1. Use of WRM:
   6.1.1. WRM supports the full range of DoD missions within our National Military Strategy
   (MCO/SSC/NEO, etc.). Accordingly, use of WRM is restricted to ensure sufficient capability
   to support Unified Combatant Commander requirements. Use must be approved only after
   considering the impact on our ability to support the National Military Strategy, and the
   ability and timeliness of reconstituting the WRM assets. WRM use is comprised of two
   categories, Direct and Indirect Mission Support as defined below.
      6.1.1.1. Direct Mission Support: Used to support JCS taskings (MCO/SSC/NEO, etc.)
      through a Unified Combatant Commander/JTF/CTF. These taskings should have an
      associated Plan ID (PID) and are sourced using JOPES procedures through GCCS.
          6.1.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Use requests are not required for direct mission support.
          Tasking Message or deployment order should authorize use of WRM. WRM
          requiring movement will be appropriately included in the operation’s TPFDD. Use
          of WRM for direct mission support will be included on the WRM Use/Reconstitution
          Data Log. See paragraph 6.3.
      6.1.1.2. Indirect Mission Support: For events other than those in 6.1.1.1, including
      Steady State AEF taskings, Joint and Air Force Exercises, training events, competitions
      (e.g., Readiness Challenge), and unit exercises. Use request and approval is as described
      in paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3, and Table 6.1.
          6.1.1.2.1. If an in-place WRM item is required frequently to support indirect mission
          needs, authorizations for this item should be reviewed and consideration made to
          increase the POS authorization.
          6.1.1.2.2. Prior to using WRM for indirect mission support, managers at all levels are
          responsible for protecting WRM from non-wartime use. Requesting organizations
          should make every effort to satisfy peacetime needs though the use of primary
          operating stocks (POS), alternative means of support, i.e., Commercial-off-the-Shelf
          (COTS) items, contractor support, host nation support, acquisition and cross servicing
          agreements, commercial replacement items and non-Air Force sources. Indirect
          mission support usage will be briefed at WRM Review Boards.
          6.1.1.2.3. The appropriate WRMPM (installation, MAJCOM or HQ USAF) is
          designated the WRM release authority for approving use requests. The MAJCOM
          WRMPM may delegate authority to the CWRMO/NCO.
          6.1.1.2.3. (PACAF) The PACAF WRMO is delegated the authority to approve Use
          Requests requiring MAJCOM WRMPM approval.
6.2. Release Authority:
   6.2.1. The installation WRMPM is the releasing authority for indirect mission support WRM
   requests for specific items for periods up to 30 days as noted in Table 6.1.
 66                                             AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


   6.2.2. The MAJCOM WRMPM (and USCENTAF/A-4) with logistics responsibility for the
   Area of Responsibility (AOR), as identified in the LOGFAC Base Cross-reference module,
   has release authority for WRM exceeding the installation WRMPM authority. The MAJCOM
   WRMPM may authorize WRM use for up to 180 days. Requests for more than 180 days
   must be approved by AF/ILGM.
   6.2.3. HQ USAF/ILGM approval is mandatory for releasing WRM to non-USAF customers,
   WRM usage in excess of 180 days and inviolate BEAR Systems.
   6.2.4. (Added-PACAF) WCDO. The WRMPM can approve issue of WCDO assets if
   replenishment is expected within 60 days of issue. If the issue reduces on-hand quantity
   below 80 percent of the WCDO authorized level for any item or cannot be replenished within
   60 days, PACAF WRMPM approval is required.

   2. An organization requiring use of WRM support equipment for 30 days or longer will
   request approval from the Storing Command. The Storing Command will coordinate with the
   Using MAJCOM to ensure proper Command and control of WRM resources and to avoid
   WRM use conflicts. The Storing Command will notify the requester of the Using
   MAJCOM’s decision after coordination.
   3. All items released for Indirect Mission Support must be available for recall within 24
   hours if required for contingency/wartime (Direct Mission Support) use.
6.3. Release Procedures:
   6.3.1. Direct Mission Support. Requests to use WRM for Direct Mission Support are
   initiated by the supported Air Component to USAF/ILGM. USAF/ILGM determines if WRM
   will be approved for the specific contingency/PID and notifies all WRM Storing Commands
   that WRM is approved for the specific PID. Tasking and coordination is through JOPES
   procedures. Funding documents are not required for release of WRM for Direct Mission
70                                          AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


  Support. The Storing Command will identify reconstitution costs, and seek reimbursement
  using the applicable ESP code for the operation.
     6.3.1.1. To preclude delays of WRM use and to allow deploying forces to tailor their
     deployment packages to the greatest extent possible, the Supported Air Component
     should include an approval statement for WRM use in applicable Deployment Orders
     (DEPORD), Request for Forces (RFF), Planning Orders, etc.
     6.3.1.2. (Added-PACAF) When WRM is used to support a direct mission or
     contingency, the WRMO will track all assets released to support the operation. The
     unit/organization using the WRM is responsible for maintaining the equipment while in
     use.
  6.3.2. Indirect Mission Support. Requests to use WRM for Indirect Mission support are
  initiated by the using organization (e.g., Operations Squadrons for war consumable
  munitions) and submitted to the installation WRMO/NCO for action. Submit WRM Indirect
  use request in writing using the format in Attachment 4. The WRMO/NCO will review the
  request and submit it to the WRMPM for approval/disapproval. WRM use requests
  exceeding installation level approval authority will include the WRMPM’s recommendation
  for approval/disapproval when elevated to MAJCOM for action. When required, use requests
  are forwarded to the next approval level by the WRMO/NCO through the appropriate
  WRMPM.
     6.3.2.1. Fund cite information from AF IMT, 616 Obligation Authority or DD Form 448,
     Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) will be provided by requesting unit
     prior to release of assets by the MAJCOM or Theater A4. Using organization will be
     assessed fees for service prior to use based on the historical cost for each asset used.
     Commands are encouraged to maintain data to determine historical cost. If historical
     costs are not available, use the following to estimate use cost. For use of 31 days and
     above, 15 percent of total asset cost; for use of 30 days and less, 10 percent of total asset
     cost. The Storing Command may negotiate the assessed cost with the User. Additional
     costs associated with use will be assessed as incurred. MAJCOMs will ensure units
     budget for these type costs when event is known in advance.
     6.3.2.2. When WRM assets are approved for use, the user is responsible for all costs
     associated with use to include packing, crating, transportation to and from the
     employment site, TDY costs for personnel deploying with the assets, contractor costs as
     applicable, reconstitution/repair of assets, MRSP costs, etc. (this list is not all inclusive).
     6.3.2.3. (Added-PACAF) Use request will be submitted using the Microsoft Outlook
     template located on the PACAF WRM SharePoint site.
  6.3.3. Exercise support. WRM may be used for exercise support provided the host unit
  exhausts all methods of support, the MCO mission is not degraded, and applicable funding
  documents are provided. The Exercise Support Plan (ESP) may substitute as the WRM Use
  Request, provided all the conditions of indirect support usage are met. Release approval is
  contingent upon receipt of funding documentation from the using organizations and will be
  reflected in the WRM and funding annex of the ESP. The appropriate coordination must be
  obtained from the WRM approval level for the commodities to be issued. The WRMO is
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                            71


   responsible for ensuring the ESP meets the WRM use approval criteria in Table 6.1 and
   paragraph 6.2.3 (i.e., Air Staff must approve issue of WRM to non-AF units).
   6.3.4. The using organization must appoint, in writing, a responsible individual to receipt
   for, control and return all WRM. Designated individuals are comparable to Supply
   Equipment Custodians and must be in the grade of E-5 or above.
6.4. Accountability:
   6.4.1. WRM consumables are issued through either SBSS or CAS to the using organization.
   6.4.2. WRM Support Equipment. During force rotations, the using organization will identify
   in advance the next equipment custodian to sign for the WRM. A joint inventory will be
   conducted at that time. Equipment custodians should be identified to the deployed PERSCO
   team to flag custodians and ensure transfer of custodianship with the Storing Command
   custodian prior to the individual’s departure.
   6.4.3. Periods less than 30 days. Issue of WRM for periods less than 30 days requires at a
   minimum, preparation of an AF Form 1297 or locally acceptable form, and signature of the
   receiving custodian. WRM issued for periods of 30 days or more requires the preparation of
   an R14 (an SBSS-generated report).
   6.4.4. If the mission support extends past six months, the theater LG and CE functional
   managers should attempt to transition to more permanent assets or contract support for
   required capabilities and begin reconstitution of WRM assets immediately.
   6.4.5. For cases of abuse during use of WRM, see AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for
   Air Force Property, for procedures.
6.5. Sustainment/Employment: The using organization is responsible for all maintenance of
issued WRM, to include funding and ordering replacement parts. Any maintenance that is
beyond the capability of the using organization must be identified to the Storing Command. The
Storing Command may assist in identifying alternatives to obtain the necessary support.
Applicable funding documents will be required by the supported Command to assist with
contract support.
6.6. Turn-in Procedures: The storing organization representative, in conjunction with the
Using organization Custodian, must document the return of WRM and identify the status of the
asset and if required, an estimated repair date. This information must be reported to release
authority for assets that require prior approval. The notification will be sent to the same agencies
included in the request message
   6.6.1. (Added-PACAF) The WRMO will establish procedures for notification that WRM
   has been returned to storage in serviceable condition. Procedures will include the storing
   organization submitting a WRM Use Return to Storage Report to the WRMO, identifying the
   WRM commodity and any other pertinent information pertaining to its use.
   6.6.2. (Added-PACAF) Prior to returning to storage, the using and WRM equipment
   custodian will conduct a joint serviceability inspection. If parts are needed to reconstitute,
   the host or using organization will requisition parts using funds as directed by the
   deployment order or the using organization’s funds (Indirect Mission Support) to ensure
   serviceability prior to departing for home station. If the parts are backordered, the using

              BASIC EXPEDITIONARY AIRFIELD RESOURCES (BEAR)

7.1. General: BEAR is a critical Agile Combat Support (ACS) capability. It provides vital
equipment and supplies necessary to beddown and support combat forces at expeditionary sites
with limited infrastructure and support facilities. As a minimum, each location must have a
runway and parking ramp suitable for aircraft operations and a source of water that can be made
potable.
7.2. BEAR
   7.2.1. BEAR consists of a variety of systems and equipment, such as personnel shelters,
   aircraft shelters, food service facilities and equipment, hygiene facilities, power and water
   production and distribution equipment, heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration
   equipment, vehicles, runway lighting, vehicle maintenance equipment, civil engineering
   equipment and associated spares configured into Mobility Readiness Spares Packages
   (MRSPs). When combined, these systems and equipment make-up the infrastructure needed
   to establish an air base in a deployed environment. BEAR, is managed as a weapon system.
   7.2.2. Units responsible for managing BEAR, to include contractor management must
   maintain 463L pallets and nets in sufficient numbers to support the movement of BEAR.
   BEAR assets are authorized use of Ship Store containers to meet TO configuration/packing
   requirements. BEAR is used in the standard AF LOGDET.
7.3. BEAR Unit Type Codes (UTC):
   7.3.1. BEAR Systems and equipment are aggregated into UTC ―sets‖ or ―packages‖ to
   provide ACS capability. BEAR sets are designed to be scalable, module, and agile. BEAR
   sets include the Swift BEAR 150 Personnel Housekeeping Set, the BEAR 550 Initial
   Housekeeping Set, 550 Follow-On Housekeeping Set, the Industrial Operations Set, the
   Initial Flightline Set, and the Follow-On Flightline Set. With the exception of the Swift
   BEAR 150 Personnel Housekeeping Set, each ―core‖ BEAR set has ―augmentation
   UTCs‖referred to as ―Playbook Options‖ (see below). BEAR sets also include legacy sets
   such as Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon, but these sets are being phased out as the new
   Force Module sets arrive.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                          75


Figure 7.1. BEAR Requirements Supporting OPLANS/CONPLANS/CONOPS/Training
/Recon Support Site.




NOTE: Eagle Flag sets are non-operational ―training‖ sets. Recon (i.e. reconstitution) are
operational sets that can support OPLAN taskings. In addition, Recon sets provide the Air Force
a ―spare set‖ capability. Recon sets are stored at 49 MMG but will not be tasked in the AFWUS.

NOTE: (Added-PACAF) ―AFWUS‖ has been replaced with the ―UTC Availability Library‖.
       7.3.1.1. Swift BEAR 150 Personnel Housekeeping (B-150) Set (UTC: XFB1A) The B-
       150 set supports up to 150 personnel in the Open-the-Base force module. The set consists
       of small shelters with environmental control, tactical power generators, limited hygiene
       facilities, camp lighting equipment and MRE rations and bottled water. A 10K all-terrain
       forklift is included for camp erection. SDCs to connect to a B-550I high voltage power
       grid are included as a Playbook Option.
       7.3.1.2. BEAR 550 Initial Housekeeping (B-550i) Set (UTC: XFB1H) The B-550i is a
       stand alone set that provides a robust camp consisting of billeting, feeding, and hygiene
       to support 550 personnel. Billeting utilizes small shelters (tents) with cots for 12 people
       per shelter. A heat pump environmental control unit provides basic heating and cooling.
       Feeding is initially provided with a Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen (SPEK) which
       provides a limited feeding capability of 2 hots and 1 MRE per person per day. The 550
       Kitchen can be deployed as a playbook option to provide full service dining capabilities
       for extended operations. Hygiene consists of latrines and shower-lavatory units. High and
       low voltage electrical and water systems are included. Shelters are provided for
       administration, mortuary, supply, base engineering and tactical field exchange functions.

       is an additive set to the B-550i which increases support to 1100 people. The B-550f
76                                         AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


     provides additional billeting, feeding, hygiene, power, water, environmental control and
     lighting assets similar to the B-550i. The 550 Kitchen can be deployed as a playbook
     option to provide added full service dining capacity. Self help laundry facilities, cold
     weather heaters, camoflague netting and concertina wire are included as playbook options
     as needed. There is no SPEK or additional shelters for base support functions. A B-550f
     is normally not deployed independent of a B-550i.
     7.3.1.4. BEAR Industrial Operations (B-IO) Set (UTC: XFBIF). The B-IO is a stand
     alone set that provides base infrastructure maintenance and logistics support for a base of
     up to 3300 personnel and three fighter aircraft squadrons or their equivalent. The set
     consists of small, medium, and large shelters for functions such as Combat Supply, Base
     Civil Engineering, Vehicle Operations and Maintenance, TMO Packing and Crating, and
     other general purpose functions. It provides additional high voltage electrical power

     aircraft (ACH); operations facilities including aircrew alert and squadron operations;
     maintenance functions such as avionics, powered/non-powered AGE, fuels laboratory,
     propulsion; and fire ops/crash rescue, storage, and other general purpose functions. Also,
     it provides a latrine and field lavatory designated for flightline operations. This set is
     dependent on a B-550i/f and B-IO for power and water support. Expeditionary airfield
     lighting systems (EALS), mobile fighter aircraft arresting systems (MAAS), industrial
     flooring and cold weather heaters are available as playbook options. Up to two BEAR
     Follow-on Flightline (B-FF) Sets may be tasked with this package.
     7.3.1.6. BEAR Follow-on Flightline (B-FF) Set (UTC: XFBFF) The B-FF set is additive
     to a B-IF set and includes limited facilities, equipment, and supplies needed to support
     flight operations and maintenance needs for a second and subsequent squadrons deployed
     to an austere base. The set consists of an ACH, small and medium shelters for
     powered/non-powered AGE, propulsion, and general purpose functions. Industrial
     flooring for selected functions and cold weaters heaters are available as playbook options.
     7.3.1.7. Legacy Sets include Harvest Eagle (HE) and Harvest Falcon (HF) Housekeeping
     Sets and PACAF’s T-550 Housekeeping Sets. These Housekeeping Sets include shelters,
     kitchens and dining facilities, showers, latrines, self-help laundries, water purification,
     storage and distribution equipment, and environmental control equipment for heating and
     air conditioning. Each Harvest Eagle Housekeeping Set supports 550 personnel. Each
     Harvest Falcon Housekeeping Set includes assets sufficient to support 1100 personnel.
     PACAF Tailored Harvest Eagle 550 Person Contingency Support Packages (T550s) are
     patterned after, and similarly equipped, to Harvest Eagle sets. T550s support 550
     personnel with billeting, kitchen, shower/shave, latrine, water production, storage and
     distribution, and power generation and distribution with environmental control units for
     air conditioning and heat. These packages do not include other base support services such
     as chapel, mortuary, self-help laundry, tactical field exchange, CE support, supply, etc.,.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                    77


      Legacy sets are being phased out of the inventory as new Force Module sets arrive. The
      last of the legacy sets are expected to be out of the inventory by fiscal year 10.
      MAJCOMs are authorized to maintain a Contingecy Reservice Stock of individual BEAR
      commodities such as tents, generators, etc., with the approval of AF/ILGM.
          7.3.1.7.1. The legacy "BEAR" equipment must be used before the new FM assets.
          All Force Module BEAR sets (B-550i/f, B-IO, B-IF,B-FF, B-150) will be inviolate.
          No individual commodity within the set will be used without prior approval
          from the respective MAJCOM and AF/ILGM. This is to insure that the entire
          set capability is preserved for wartime use.
   7.3.2. BEAR Vehicles. The following vehicles are authorized for deployment in direct
   support of BEAR Systems. These assets are used to move BEAR assets; position, erect, and
   service BEAR facilities; and sustain BEAR operations while deployed.

   sets can be obtained from HQ ACC/LGXW. Reports are based only on critical assets
   authorized.
   7.4.3. The BEAR Monthly Status Report. Managed and published by HQ ACC/LGXW for
   AF/ILG. All BEAR commands will provide a BEAR Monthly Status Report to HQ ACC/
   LGXW upon request IAW the following criteria. This criteria also applies to SORTS
   reporting:
      7.4.3.1. MC (GREEN) - Mission Capable - 100% of critical items on-hand. 75% of non
      critical items on-hand in garrison and all deployed sets.
      7.4.3.2. PMC (YELLOW) - Partially Mission Capable - At least 50% of critical items
      on-hand. At least 50% of non critical items on-hand.
      7.4.3.3. NMC (RED) - Non Mission Capable - Less than 50% of critical items on-hand,
      or in reconstitution.
7.5. Mission Use of BEAR:
   7.5.1. BEAR supports the full range of DOD missions within our National Military Strategy
   (MCO/SSC/NEO, etc.) BEAR may be used only for direct mission support. Direct mission
   support is use of BEAR to support a Combatant Commander tasking, or approval by
   USAF/ILG. Indirect use of BEAR (i.e. training, exercises, etc.,) the approval of the
   applicable MAJCOM and USAF/ILG.
      7.5.1.1. For Direct Mission Support or Indirect Mission Support, Air Components
      deploying BEAR sets will ensure deployment of sufficient supply personnel, in
      accordance with UTC MISCAPs, to support the deployment, reception and sustainment
      of BEAR assets. This includes maintaining accountability of all equipment, vehicles, and
      MRSPs. Sufficient BEAR experienced supply personnel (UTCs XFBJ2, XFBKB,
      XFBPF, JFBBS, etc. and may include contract support) must stay with the BEAR assets
      for the duration of the employment to ensure proper BEAR supply discipline and
      accountability. In addition, Civil Engineer Prime BEEF teams must be placed in the
      TPFDD for the set-up, sustainment, and teardown of BEAR camps. When required, 49
      MMG UTC XFB1 ―J1‖ Large Structure Teams and/or RED HORSE UTCs may be
      tasked for large structure erection.
          7.5.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Supporting Supply personnel will be postured in UTC
          XFBPF and tasked with UTC XFB1H. Functional Account Code (FAC) 41
          personnel may be substituted with any FAC coded Air Force Special Code (AFSC)
          2S051.
      7.5.1.2. Indirect Mission Support Use and Approval. Approval for use of BEAR sets for
      indirect mission support is limited. If required, they will initiate by the using organization
      and submitted to the installation WRMO/NCO for action with a strong justification.
          7.5.1.2.1. Submit BEAR indirect mission support use request in writing using the
          format in Attachment 4. The WRMO/NCO will review the request and submit it for
          approval as follows:
             7.5.1.2.1.1. Wing/Unit WRMPM for use for periods of up to 72 hours and which
             will not adversely impact asset readiness to perform its primary mission.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                          79


             7.5.1.2.1.2. MAJCOM WRMPM for use periods greater than 72 hours, but less
             than 180 days.
             7.5.1.2.1.3. AF/ILGM (through MAJCOM) for use periods greater than 180 days.
             7.5.1.2.1.4. AF/ILGM (through MAJCOM) for all use by non-AF users.
             7.5.1.2.1.5. AF/ILGM is the approval authority for all requests involving
             inviolate stock.
             7.5.1.2.1.6. The 49 MMG/CC/CD have release authority for BEAR assets under
             the following conditions:
                 7.5.1.2.1.6.1. Training within the MMG compound.
                 7.5.1.2.1.6.2. Use on Holloman AFB, and the local area, for up to 72 hours.
                 7.5.1.2.1.6.3. Mobile Training Team assets when used for instruction,
                 regardless of use location.
      7.5.1.3. The Air Component Supply function is responsible for determining and
      disseminating a Supply Concept of Operations for the deployment. This CONOPS will
      identify procedures for establishing and operating a BEAR Supply function and
      managing accountability of assets.
      7.5.1.4. Indirect mission support use is O&M funded by the using organization. The
      funding document from the user must stay open until all assets have been reconstituted.
   7.5.2. Employment/Sustainment:
      7.5.2.1. The contingency site CES has overall accountability and responsibility for
      maintaining the BEAR assets. The CES/CC signs the appropriate documentation and
      assumes responsibility of BEAR equipment assets. When deployed to support theater
      activities, 49 MMG and other AF supply personnel (JFBBS) deployed in direct support of
      BEAR assets assist the CE commander in tracking and assigning responsibility to major
      users.
      7.5.2.2. Supply personnel deployed under BEAR UTCs work for the contingency site
      CES/CC to account for, requisition, and maintain accountability of BEAR assets. The
      contingency site BEAR supply personnel call in parts requirements and MRSP
      replenishment to the respective AOR Regional Supply Squadron (RSS), as required,
      when MRSP assets are consumed or do not contain the necessary parts.
      7.5.2.3. All BEAR MRSPs will be transferred before each deployment to the applicable
      Regional Supply Squadron IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol II, Part 2, Chap 26, paragraph
      26.26.3.1. Transferred MRSPs will be under the control of the contingency site CES/CC
      until returned to home station.
7.6. Redeployment:
   7.6.1. Components may use a variety of options to redeploy BEAR assets to include Rapid
   Area Distribution Support (RADS) teams, 49 MMG personnel, contractor personnel, or CE
   personnel. The goal for this phase is an orderly breakdown of BEAR assets so they can be
   redeployed and reconstituted as quickly as possible. The contingency site CES must be
   relieved of accountability before redeploying.
 80                                         AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


   7.6.2. The contingency site CES, 49 MMG, and owning Air Component will do a joint
   inventory and review of accountable documentation. Once completed, the Storing Command
   will reassume responsibility.
   7.6.3. BEAR assets must be redeployed in a timely manner to ensure BEAR future
   contingency operations readiness. Use of the BEAR Life Cycle Matrix is recommended for
   movement prioritization.
   7.6.4. If the supported command needs to keep all or a portion of BEAR assets deployed
   longer than 6 months, the supported Air Component must provide AF/ILG and ACC/LGX a
   report citing the requirement, and plans for transitioning to more permanent facilities so
   BEAR assets retained will not remain on WRM accounts. All deployed BEAR assets will be
   redistributed to the Contingency Allowance Standard 058 after being deployed for 179 days
   or longer. The contingency site CES maintains accountability of the assets upon transfer
   (Redistribution Order [RDO]). MRSP consumables will be expensed to the contingency site
   CES upon transfer of applicable equipment. Establish levels under the contingency site Chief
   of Supply for any applicable XD2 MRSP assets. After the MRSP is expensed and levels are
   established, delete all applicable contingency site BEAR MRSP detail records.
7.7. Transition from BEAR/WRM Assets:
   7.7.1. Operational scenarios frequently result in undetermined or extended deployment
   periods. Additionally, across the board replacement of BEAR assets is generally not
   operationally feasible. Therefore, deployed BEAR assets should be targeted for
   replacement/reconstitution in a prioritized method.
   7.7.2. On the 90th day of deployment, if across-the-board replacement is not feasible,
   Component LG and CE should authorize and direct CES/CCs to replace BEAR assets at a
   minimum IAW the general prioritization below. Locally procured resources or Air
   Component/AF-level resources (via AFCAP or theater-wide direct vendor contracts) can be
   used to obtain commercial replacements (contact BEAR Systems Office for assistance if
   required). The prioritization is based on relative importance of the commodity to BEAR
   capabilities, ease of replacement, and/or quality of life enhancements.
      7.7.2.1. Latrine and Shower/Shave units, Power Assets (generators, PDCs/PSCs, SDCs,
      ECUs, etc.), Kitchens, TF-1/2 Light Carts, Shelters. Shelters required for additive
      missions are better candidates for alternative sourcing. Additionally, all shelters required
      for quality of life enhancements that are not incorporated into BEAR packages should be
      supported by commercial sources.
      7.7.2.2. Specialized assets that are more difficult to replace with commercial alternatives,
      such as arresting systems, reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPUs), airfield
      lighting, etc. will generally not be targeted for early replacement. Assets targeted for
      replacement will be redeployed to the Air Component for reconstitution.
      7.7.2.3. Assets tasked to support joint operations at sites that are not commanded by AF
      personnel should be transferred IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol II, Part Two, Chapter 22,
      Transfers to Non-AF Activities, at the 120-day point if alternative sources do not appear
      feasible.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              81


      7.7.2.4. All fuel and water bladders should be transferred to the contingency CES/CC
      (AS058) at the time of deployment. There will be no reconstitution of bladders.
7.8. BEAR Reconstitution:
   7.8.1. When BEAR assets are approved for use, the user is responsible for all costs
   associated with use to include packing, crating, transportation to and from the employment
   site, TDY costs for personnel deploying with the assets, contractor costs as applicable,
   reconstitution/repair of assets, and MRSP costs (this list is not all inclusive). For use less than
   30 days, 10 percent of the cost of each item used must be deposited by Military
   Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)/AF IMT 616, Fund Cite Authorization, with the
   providing unit prior to equipment release. For use exceeding 30 days, the deposit required is
   15 percent of each item. Funds in excess of those deposited for reconstitution will be returned
   to the user. Costs in excess of funds deposited will be charged to the user.
   7.8.2. Reconstitution will be conducted for all equipment, vehicles, and MRSPs, upon return
   of BEAR assets to home BEAR units as money and contractual limitations permit. Timelines
   should be evaluated as the situation unfolds. Once reconstitution is complete, the BEAR unit
   will submit an End-of-Deployment/Reconstitution Report to their applicable MAJCOM
   CWRMO/NCO and a separate copy to HQ ACC/LGXW. The BEAR End-of-
   Deployment/Reconstitution Report format can be found in Attachment 9.
7.9. Life Cycle Matrix:
   7.9.1. WR-ALC BEAR System Program Director (SPD), with input from 49 MMG/LGX
   (BEAR Pilot Unit) as well as ACC/LGXW, USCENTAF/LGXR, USAFE/A4OW,
   PACAF/LG-ALOCW, AMC/A45A, and AFCESA, as appropriate, will design and maintain
   a BEAR Life Cycle Matrix (LCM). The LCM will provide the basis for forecasting likely
   asset impacts and costs for training, storing, deploying, maintaining, reconstituting, and
   replacing BEAR equipment items. This product will be critical to enabling funding and asset
   procurement forecasts. LCM is critical to the POM process for initial, shortage, and
   replacement BEAR requirements.
7.10. BEAR Integrated Management Team (BIMT):
   7.10.1. Mission Statement. The Air Force BEAR Integrated Management Team (BIMT)
   ensures AF BEAR capability to meet DOD mission needs consistent with Unified Combatant
   Commander (UCC) requirements and overall AF and DOD policy and programming
   guidance for BEAR and related systems as directed in Program Management Directive
   (PMD) 2054, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources. To achieve these goals, the BIMT is
   responsible for the full range of management actions necessary to program, fund, acquire,
   store, deploy, sustain, reconstitute, and upgrade AF BEAR assets.
   7.10.2. BIMT responsibilities are accomplished through a structure that encourages
   participation from all relevant MAJCOMs, associated agencies and organizations at
   appropriate levels of involvement. The multi-agency BEAR Integrated Product Team is the
   working level group responsible for managing day-to-day activities involving system
   requirements, configurations, upgrades, and resource programming. The multi-agency BEAR
   Systems Readiness Board is the senior-level board responsible for overall program oversight,
   guidance, and direction. The BEAR General Officer Steering Group (GOSG) provides AF
   executive-level oversight, guidance, and direction of the program. AFPD 25-1, War Reserve
 82                                          AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


   Materiel, and AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and
   Procedures, and PMD 2054, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR), are the
   authoritative directives for responsibilities incumbent in the respective groups. The Air Force
   War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Vol. 1, provides the operational foundation for
   supporting the worldwide UCCs with BEAR resources. The Strategic Planning Guidance
   provides specific BEAR programming guidance. PMD 2054 (10) provides program direction
   for acquisition, replacement and sustainment of BEAR Systems and equipment.
7.11. BEAR Integrated Product Team (BIPT):
   7.11.1. The BIPT integrates and coordinates day-to-day BEAR management activities for
   the AF. It is the primary group for coordinating activities of functional communities in the
   multi-functional BEAR management process. The BIPT is the initial entry or gatekeeper for
   issues, ideas, concerns, etc., concerning the overall BEAR program. The BIPT prioritizes
   issues and presents those requiring further action to the BSRB.
   7.11.2. ACC/LGX is chartered by AFI 25-101 to organize and lead the multi-agency BIPT.
   ACC accomplishes these responsibilities pursuant to ACC Mission Directive 38-313.
   ACC/LGXW chairs the BIPT and is responsible for publishing implementing instructions for
   the BIPT.
   7.11.3. The BIPT manages and integrates issues related to BEAR to include system
   sustainment and equipment upgrades to increase AF BEAR capabilities. The BIPT acts as the
   BEAR Weapon System Team (WST) within the Combat Air Forces (CAF) modernization
   process, and is responsible for planning, programming, budgeting, directing, and assessing
   materiel solutions to identified BEAR system and equipment deficiencies. Sustainment and
   product improvement of BEAR Systems and equipment as directed by the BSRB, through
   the BIPT, is managed through the AFMC System Program Director at WR-ALC/LEB.
      7.11.3.1. Upgrading and sustaining BEAR capability is a multi-functional process
      involving numerous disciplines. As a result, establishing priorities for system upgrades
      may, at times, conflict with individual functional desires. The collective goal of the BIPT
      is to ensure that BEAR system capabilities are improved, without regard to any one
      functional desire, to maximize total system capability within existing and programmed
      resources.
      7.11.3.2. The BIPT addresses, on behalf of the CAF, BEAR capabilities, upgrades,
      configuration control, UTC development, suggested enhancements, and other issues
      relative to BEAR support of Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) operations.
      7.11.3.3. All recommended changes to the BEAR System or stand-alone systems that
      require interface/support from the BEAR SPD (i.e., water, power generation and
      distribution) must be coordinated through the BEAR SPD under the Single Manager. The
      SPD is responsible for the assurance of Operational, Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness
      of the BEAR System. SPD personnel along with the submitting organization will perform
      required research and provide a recommendation to the BIPT based on impact(s) to the
      system. The BIPT will approve, recommend approval to BRSB, or return for additional
      research any recommended BEAR Systems changes.
   7.11.4. The BIPT meets formally in the spring of each year, which all BIPT members attend.
   Issues needing to be addressed out-of-cycle will be coordinated electronically or by special
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                       83


   meetings at the chairperson’s discretion. Issues affecting or requiring limited functional
   involvement for resolution will be coordinated electronically or through meetings with
   affected functional members. The BIPT chair may call meetings to address other BIPT issues
   more frequently if required. In all cases however, decisions will be promulgated to all BIPT
   members for their information.
      7.11.4.1. BIPT decisions are undertaken by simple majority vote of principal members in
      attendance or responding to an electronic vote request.
          7.11.4.1.1. When a principal BIPT member non-concurs with a BIPT decision, they
          can formally request that the BIPT chair forward the issue to the BSRB for final
          consideration. These requests are documented in the BIPT minutes.
          7.11.4.1.2. When a BSRB principal member non-concurs with a BIPT decision and
          so requests, the BIPT chair will forward the decision and non-concurrence to the
          BSRB chair for inclusion on the BSRB agenda for further consideration. These
          requests are documented in BSRB minutes.

          electronically or by special meetings at the BSRB chairperson’s discretion.
7.12. BEAR Systems Readiness Board (BSRB):
   7.12.1. The BSRB is the O-6 level management group that directs and oversees the AF
   BEAR Program. ACC/LGX chairs the BSRB. The BSRB will meet at least annually,
   generally in May. If deemed necessary, the BSRB chair may call for special out-of-cycle
   meetings to resolve or discuss issues. When situations require, BSRB issues may be
   addressed and coordinated electronically. The predominant means of input to the BSRB is
   through the BIPT.
      7.12.1.1. The BSRB tasks the BIPT for recommendations or further study as required.
      When necessary, the BSRB will establish subordinate working groups to resolve specific
      issues.
      7.12.1.2. The BSRB forwards unresolved issues to the BEAR General Officer Steering
      Group (GOSG) for resolution (see 7.12.1.5.4).
      7.12.1.3. BSRB decisions are undertaken by simple majority vote of principal members
      in attendance or responding to an electronic vote request.
      7.12.1.4. Decision issues in the following areas require mandatory review and approval
      by the BSRB:
          7.12.1.4.1. Strategic positioning or repositioning of BEAR Systems.
          7.12.1.4.2. Increases or decreases to overall AF BEAR inventory objectives.
          7.12.1.4.3. Funding of BEAR programs to include Appropriation 3080, 3400, and
          any related 3600 activities undertaken by Civil Engineer or other functional agencies
          on behalf of the BSRB.
      7.12.1.5. Decisions are promulgated, subject to review, and reclama as follows:
          7.12.1.5.1. The BIPT formally transmits decisions from annual and special meetings
          to all members via published meeting minutes. BIPT members have 30 days from the
 84                                        AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


          issuance of these minutes to brief and coordinate with their leadership on the
          decisions and any non-concurrence. Principal BSRB members, within this 30-day
          reclama window, may formally request any decision or issue with which there is
          disagreement be reconsidered at the BSRB’s next scheduled meeting. If there is no
          notification of disagreement, the BIPT decisions stand as written. During the 30-day
          reclama, period BSRB principal members may also revoke any non-concurrence
          registered by their BIPT member.
          7.12.1.5.2. When a BSRB principal member non-concurs with a BIPT decision and
          so requests, the BIPT chair will forward the decision and non-concurrence to the
          BSRB chair for inclusion on the BSRB agenda for further consideration. These
          requests are documented in BSRB minutes.
          7.12.1.5.3. When circumstances warrant, reclama issues may be coordinated
          electronically or by special meetings at the BSRB chair’s discretion.
          7.12.1.5.4. BEAR General Officer Steering Group (GOSG). The BEAR GOSG is
          the Air Force’s executive body charged with executive level responsibility for BEAR.
          The GOSG is responsible for the oversight and strategic direction of the BEAR
          Program. The GOSG is chaired by AF/ILG who is the Air Force’s Office of Primary
          Responsibility for BEAR management, policy, and procedures. The GOSG meets a
          minimum of three times per year and is hosted by one of the member organizations.
7.13. Membership:
   7.13.1. The membership structure for the MTBIPT including the BIPT, BSRB, and the
   GOSG is designed to include representation from relevant customers, functional providers,
   and those technical organizations providing technical support to sustain and maintain AF
   BEAR capabilities. Membership is divided into principal and associate members. Principal
   members have critical roles and significant vested interests in providing and ensuring BEAR

     WAR CONSUMABLE DISTRIBUTION OBJECTIVE (WCDO) PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose: The WCDO document is the USAF’s approved means to pre-position war
consumables at or near the Planned Operating Bases (POB) in support of USAF aviation forces
documented in the HQ USAF War Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4). It also provides war
consumables in support of in-place and deployed ground support equipment.
   8.1.1. The WCDO document mirrors the WMP-4 wartime planned lines of activity and
   provides WRM consumable requirements. The WCDO is a deliberate planning document
   that identifies ―Worst Case‖ OPLAN, CONPLAN, and/or Plan Set requirements. LOGFAC
   is the Air Force system serving as the WMP-4 database and is used to compute WCDO
   consumables requirements, except munitions. The WCDO is produced and distributed to the
   host installation WRMO/NCO annually, as a minimum. Munitions pre-positioning
   requirements are derived through the NCAA process. NCAA theater allocations form the
   basis for WCDO preparation. In commands without OPLANs and tasked to store swing
   locks, allocation objectives serve the sample purpose as a WCDO.
       8.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) HQ PACAF/A4X:
          8.1.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) LOGFAC system executive agent for PACAF.
          8.1.1.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Coordinates on all access requests to LOGFAC
          database from SIPRNET terminals.
          8.1.1.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Manage PACAF accounts and permissions.
          8.1.1.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Reviews the War Mobilization Plan (WMP) 4-
          Command Working (CW) to validate prepositioning codes to ensure the War
          Consumables Factors (WARCON) File is aligned with the force bed down.
          8.1.1.1.5. (Added-PACAF) De-conflicts WMP4 and WARCON with air component
          operations.
          8.1.1.1.6. (Added-PACAF) Provide PACAF/A4R, SCM CWRMM excess/shortage
          list for redistribution and disposition.
8.2. Overview: HQ USAF/XOXW produces the WMP-3, Part 1, to apportion Combat Forces
to Air Component Commands. These Combat Forces are then documented in the WMP-4 by the
Air Component Operational Command Planner. Each line of activity is unique. If the USAF does
not apportion your unit in the WMP-3, you will not be tasked in the WMP-4. AMC strategic
airlift and tanker lines of activity are produced by Joint Flow and Analysis System for
Transportation (JFAST) as part of the AMC WMP-4. The WMP-4 build process is outlined in
Figure 8.1.
   8.2.1. The WMP-4 consists of 4 parts. These are:
       8.2.1.1. Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA). USAF wartime aircraft lines of activity are
       identified by a unique line number in the WMP-4.
       8.2.1.2. Missiles. Air-to-air missiles are apportioned in the Tactical Air Missile Program
       (TAMP). Type M records.

  8.2.2. The WCDO is produced as follows:
     8.2.2.1. Non-munitions day-by-day requirements. Identifies the day-by-day non-
     munitions consumable requirements to support WMP-4 sorties by POB, Plan (ALL
     PLANS), MDS and Unit.
     8.2.2.2. Non-munitions Accumulative Totals. Identifies the total POB non-munitions
     consumable requirements by NSN, the most stringent Plan quantity/Starter
     quantity/Swing quantity/Allocated quantity.
     8.2.2.3. Munitions day-by-day requirements. Identifies the day-by-day munitions
     consumable requirements to support WMP-4 sorties by POB, Plan (ALL PLANS), MDS
     and Unit.

Cross Reference Data—Collection of data files updated as follows:
OPLAN Warning Time Data—The WMP-1, Annex E identifies the number of Starter days
authorized for pre-positioning assets. The Command planner can override these days using the
EXCEPTIONS field in the WARN module and/or the Item Identification Detail module.
Exceptions in the WARN file are used to decrease the number of starter days required for pre-
positioning stock. Exceptions in the Item Identification table are used to decrease the number of
starter days required for a specific commodity by group code (01-Tanks), family code (X-POL),
or DODIC (250X-Deicing). The exception date cannot be higher than the WARN days or
Exception days, when there is one, in the WARN table.
Aircraft Planning Factor Data—Interface with WMP-5. This data is dynamic and can be
specific to the Command and MDS. Provides by fiscal year, aircraft category, MDS and role, the
fuel type, fuel gallons per hour, fuel reserve time and the reserve quantity.

       TPFDD.
   8.3.2. Information contained in the WAA is classified by the USAF WMP-4. Each line of
   activity in the WMP-4 contains the security classification of that line. The WMP-4 extract for
   a single base will be classified in accordance with the line of activity having the highest
   classification. The WAA extract contains information affecting the National Defense of the
   United States within the meaning of Espionage Laws, Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 793 and 794.
   8.3.3. Specific OPLAN/CONPLAN and the WAA extract should be used to evaluate the
   logistics resources available at an installation to support all taskings upon Plan
   implementation. Based upon results of the evaluation, the unit is responsible for ensuring, to
   the maximum extent possible, that adequate resources are available to support documented
   wartime activity. Commanders will make every effort to ensure approved levels of support
   are requisitioned, stored, and maintained ready for use. Any support deficiencies beyond unit
   capability to resolve must be identified through appropriate intermediate headquarters to the
   applicable MAJCOM for staff assistance or action as appropriate. This evaluation process
   should include but is not limited to:
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                          95


     8.3.3.1. An analysis of built-up tanks and RAP requirements to satisfy initial wartime
     sorties (if tanks and RAP are authorized on the WCDO). The built-up tanks and RAP
     objective (assets in ready-to-use status) should be determined based on a projected daily
     consumption rate of each type tank and RAP and the unit’s build-up capability (consider
     in-place and wartime augmentation capability). Daily wartime expenditure rates can be
     estimated by dividing the total authorized (of each tanks and RAP item) by the number of
     days authorized to be pre-positioned.
     8.3.3.2. A survey of appropriate military and commercial sources of consumables such
     as LOX, deicing, and gaseous oxygen for support of documented wartime activity.
     8.3.3.3. Development of an aircraft parking plan to allocate available airfield ramp space
     to accommodate the maximum number of tactical and support aircraft programmed to be
     on the ground during any one-time period. Planning should consider airfield schedules to
     allow for both in-place and any additive aircraft.
     8.3.3.4. Analysis of equipment capability provided by in-place base support resources,
     WRM station sets and additive force mobility packages to service and turnaround all
     aircraft identified in the unit’s WAA extract.
     8.3.3.5. Analysis of aircraft refueling capability based upon available refueling vehicles
     and hydrant systems.
     8.3.3.6. Other planning factors unique to specific locations, which could impact
     execution of unit wartime taskings.
  8.3.4. Currency of WAA Data. The WAA extract is a projection of planned activity for
  support of all OPlans. Ideally, information published in the WAA should reflect activity for
  the most recent OPLAN edition. However, since all OPLAN/CONPLAN (with TPFDD) are
  not updated at the same time and the WAA is prepared on an annual cycle with updates at the
  discretion of individual Commands, the document represents a "snapshot" at the time
  Command data is prepared. No attempt should be made to match specific plan deployment
  tasking to airlift sorties in the document. Airlift sorties reflected in the WAA are predicated
  on the JCS-approved version of the plan existing at the time of preparation. The airlift sorties
  depicted do not necessarily consider the latest plan versions or revisions but are
  representative of overall airlift support requirements and are identified for programming
  activities and overall funding considerations. Airlift support planning is finalized at the time
  of OPLAN execution, at which time available airlift sorties would be dedicated on the basis
  of total movement requirements including unit and non-unit deployment priorities.
  8.3.5. Units undergoing aircraft MDS conversion will be provided a new WAAR when the
  HQ USAF WAAR, reflecting the new MDS, is approved and released at MAJCOM level.
  New documents cannot be produced based upon proposed or current conversions still in
  progress. A unit has to be officially identified as undergoing an MDS change before any
  changes are made to the WAAR.
  8.3.6. Inform CWRMO/NCO when unit possessed aircraft have changed MDS, for example
  F-16A/B to F-16C/D. Likewise, unknown aircraft system modifications may effect changes
  to the WAAR and WCDO and will cause problems if not properly documented. This is
  especially true if the consumables are no longer compatible with the new aircraft or system
  modification.

   8.3.7. Specific questions or comments relating to WAA should be addressed to the
   Command Operations Planner or to AFMC/LGR for AFMC-related comments and questions.
   When addressing specific WAA issues, indicate line number and Command code from the
   WAA Report.
      8.3.7.1. (Added-PACAF) In PACAF, WAA questions and/or comments should be
      addressed to PACAF/A5.
8.4. War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO):
   8.4.1. The WCDO extract for each base identifies the USAF War Reserve Materiel pre-
   positioning/pre-stocking requirements at designated locations worldwide to support the
   wartime activities documented in the USAF WMP-4. The WCDO is current on the day
   printed. It supports the USAF War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4), Wartime
   Aircraft Activity Report, and WMP-1, Annex E, Logistics.
   8.4.2. Security Instructions. Each page of the WCDO is classified by content. Detailed
   Security guidance is contained in Executive Order 12958. Ensure all documents are marked
   with proper security classification, reasons for classification, classified by, and downgrading
   instruction per EO 12958.
   8.4.3. This section provides WRMO/NCOs at all levels of command information for use in
   managing and interpreting WRM objectives/requirements and acquainting them with the
   concepts and terminology used in the WCDO. The WCDO build process is outlined in
   Figure 8.2.

Figure 8.2. WCDO Build Process.




WMP4-A—Produced by the Executive Operational Manager (AF/XOXW). Final approved
WMP-4 used for deliberate planning and to produce the WCDO. This file cannot be updated
from this point.
OPLAN Warning Time Data—The WMP-1 identifies the number of Starter days authorized
for pre-positioning assets. The Command planner can override these days using the
EXCEPTIONS field in the WARN module and/or the Item Identification Detail module.
Exceptions in the WARN file are used to decrease the number of starter days required for pre-
positioning stock. Exceptions in the Item Identification table are used to decrease the number of
starter days required for a specific commodity by group code (01-Tanks), family code (X-POL),
or DODIC (250X-Deicing). The exception date cannot be higher than the WARN days or
Exception days, when there is one, in the WARN table.
Item Identification Data— Detailed information of each DODIC. Provides the NSN,
nomenclature, unit of issue, quantity unit pack, weight, cube, cost, and source of supply as
related to an Item Identity Code (IIC) Department of Defense Item Code (DODIC), group code
or a family group (W = Munitions, X = POL, Y = TRAP, and Z = miscellaneous). Also contains
alternate IIC’s, unit of issue conversions, substitute NSNs and further breakdown of starter
exception days by IIC.

Aircraft Oil / Fuel Tank Data— Provides the Oil DODIC, Oil Factor, and tank capacity by
MDS. This file is primarily a static table.
War Consumable Factor Data—The WCDO build looks in this file to determine what
consumables are needed and the factor to calculate the quantity to support each line of activity on
the WAA by MDS and role. This file was updated by the Command Planner in the WMP-4C
process.
Base Cross Reference Data—This data is sourced from the JOPES GEOLOC file by an
automated interface or updated by the Executive Manager (ACC/LGXW).
PSEUDO Base Codes—Pulled from the PSEUDO table. This file is generated by the Executive
Manager. The PSEUDO Base Codes when associated with an actual location or Base Code
is classified SECRET.
End Item Priority of Build Data—This is the Complete Round Code (CRC) out of the
Complete Round Dictionary maintained by OO-ALC/WMC at Hill AFB. This is an automated
interface.
WRM Consumable Assets Data—This is asset balances obtained from the SBSS, CAS and
FAS systems. It contains supply, fuels and munitions data.
Requirement Data—These are assets required to support OPLAN taskings.
WCDO Build—Ran by the MAJCOM Logistics Planner. This is only performed one time a year
and should not be run again until a new WMP4-A is published. In the build process, the
following data is pulled to ―build‖ your report:
WCDO Print—Produced by the Command Planner. WCDO print can be run as often as needed
after the WCDO Build is complete. Inquiries are made to the following tables at the time of the
print request.
Missile Allocations—Pulled from the NCAA table.

EXCEPTION: Pulled from the WARN table and/or the Item Identification table. The Command
Planner updated this file in the WCDO process. This file determines how many starter days to
calculate for starter stock on the WCDO when it is different from the WMP1.
Non-Munitions Allocations—Data is fed into this table by the R18 transferred in by the units.

8.5. CWRMO/NCO will:
  8.5.1. Give the WCDO program appropriate priority to successfully pre-position the correct
  war consumables at the right Planned Operating Base for the forces documented in the HQ
  USAF WMP-4.
  8.5.2. Provide adds, changes, or deletions to the cross-reference requiring LOGFAC
  Executive Manager permissions in LOGFAC to ACC/LGXW.
  8.5.3. Produce the WMP-4 and WCDO extract by POB and distribute these documents to the
  installation WRMO/NCO NLT 1 October each year.
  8.5.4. Ensures units correctly load WCDO authorizations on base supply W-detail records.
     8.5.4.1. (Added-PACAF) The HQ PACAF/A4R, SCM CWRMM will assist the
     CWRMO in verifying the W-details were correctly loaded in SBSS.

8.6. Installation WRMO/NCO will:
   8.6.1. Upon receipt of the WCDO, WAAR and the foreword, maintain and send a copy of
   the extracts to supply and munitions (when applicable). The WRMO/NCO and WRMMs
   must conduct an analysis to evaluate the resources needed at your installation based upon the
   current WAAR. The WCDO and the WAAR are distributed simultaneously and a
   review/validation of both documents must be conducted. The WRMO/NCO must provide a
   copy of the WCDO to the functional WRMM’s no later than seven days after receipt. Supply
   must update all WCDO detail records to reflect current authorizations within 30 days.
         8.6.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Provide the Supply WRMM a copy of the WCDO, WCDO
         Foreword, and WCDO cover letter within seven days of receipt of a new WCDO or a
         change to the current WCDO.
   8.6.2. Scrutinize and review the WAAR by each line of activity, specifically the sorties, by
   role and pre-positioning code and compare the WCDO quantities required day-by-day with
   the sortie information obtained from the WAAR. Next, review the WCDO Munitions and
   Non-Munitions Accumulative Total page to determine the most stringent requirement for
   each item, supporting all AF wartime aircraft activity at the planned operating base. The most
   important phase of this evaluation is working with the WRMMs. Assemble the host
   operations, supply, munitions, fuels, services and civil engineer, and other WRMMs, as
   applicable, to review these documents. Jointly, determine if the WCDO consumable asset
   quantities appear reasonable based on the information/documentation provided.
         8.6.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Identify discrepancies, storage and maintenance limitations,
         excess and shortages, found during the review and forward to the CWRMO NLT 30 days
         from receipt of a new WCDO or a change to the current WCDO.

          8.6.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The Korea COBs, 51 LRS, and 8 LRS will report
          excess, shortages, and unserviceable WCDO to the 7AF/A4 WRMO and Supply
          Chain Management function.
          8.6.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) The 7AF/A4 WRMO will resolve issues for the Korea
          locations first then forward unresolved issues to the CWRMO and Command Supply
          Chain WRM Manager.
8.7. Installation WRMMs will:
   8.7.1. The commodity WRMM is responsible for ensuring adequate resources are available
   to support wartime activities based upon the results of the evaluation. Receipt of your
   WCDO gives your unit the authority to process supply detail record changes and initiate
   requisitioning action. The host installation Commander is ultimately responsible for making
   every effort to ensure approved levels of support are requisitioned, stored, and maintained
   ready for use. The new WCDO may reflect smaller or larger quantities and even contain
   different items. Requisition new items and increased quantities as funding permits. Consider
   alternate sources of supply. On-hand quantities greater than the new authorized quantities are
   excess. This evaluation and the information obtained provide the basis for your WRM
   Review Board. WRMM Functional Responsibilities are as follows:
       8.7.1.1. Operations plans subject matter expert: Reviews and validates the WAA for
       aircraft data, roles, sortie duration, munitions expenditures and types.
       8.7.1.2. Material Management Flight, Storage Element, and WRMM: Evaluates
       consumable quantities to determine if there is adequate storage, etc.
       8.7.1.3. Management and Systems Flight (Customer Service) WRMM: Reviews all
       detail numbers prior to realigning the "W" details to agree with the new WCDO. There
       are exceptions for loading items on SBSS detail records (e.g., aviation fuel and rations).
       When loading WCDO requirements for non-munitions items, use activity code W,
       organization code 002, and shop code of ―WR.‖
          8.7.1.3.1. (Added-PACAF) WCDO details will be established IAW AFMAN 23-
          110, V2, P2, Chap 26B-6 and special instructions included in the WCDO Foreword.
          8.7.1.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Ensure excess WCDO commodities are transferred to a
          002XS account.
          8.7.1.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Use the Pseudo Base Code on the current WCDO for
          excess items transferred to the 002XS account.
       8.7.1.4. Fuels WRMM: Evaluates the daily fuel consumption rates and the total fuels
       requirement from the WCDO summary page to determine if the Bulk Petroleum War
       Reserve Stock (BPWRS) identified in the IMP adequately supports the WAA.
       8.7.1.5. Munitions WRMM (MASO): Evaluates munitions quantities to determine if
       there is adequate storage, etc. The WRMM is responsible for maintaining WRM
       munitions levels at current allocated quantities. The authorized quantity is listed under
       the requirement total for each item identification code (DODIC) listed. When loading
       WCDO requirements for munitions items use activity code W, organization code 002,
       and shop code of ―WR.‖
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                      103


      8.7.1.6. Services WRMM: Evaluates MREs for self-sustaining units and air and missile
      crews.
          8.7.1.6.1. (Added-PACAF) Rations (200X). Do not load SBSS details for rations.
          The Force Support Squadron WRMM will review the WCDO and determine if
          aircrew ration requirements can be supported by the In-Flight Kitchen (box lunches).
          If rations are needed to support aircrew requirements, the WRMM will provide the
          quantity required to PACAF/A1R (Services). Services will include aircrew rations in
          the commands input to the Funded Ration Letter.
      8.7.1.7. Other applicable organizations: Evaluate requirements for consumables.
      8.7.1.8. (Added-PACAF) WCDO excess will be controlled, managed and maintained
      as WRM until receipt of disposition instructions from the CWRMO and/or the Command
      Supply Chain WRM Manager.
   8.7.2. All needed changes to the WCDO will be forwarded from the WRMO/NCO to
   CWRMO/NCO.
   8.7.3. After all details are loaded, the installation WRMO/NCO will receive and validate
   reports (R07 from supply).
      8.7.3.1. (Added-PACAF) The Supply function will provide the WRMO an R07, NLT
      30 days of the initial WCDO upload and quarterly thereafter. The WRMO/NCO will
      review the R07 to ensure all WCDO authorizations are correctly loaded.
8.8. Data Descriptions:
   8.8.1. Base Cross-Reference Data. Contains data elements necessary to identify a specific
   location and alternate locations as they relate to the POB. It also contains required
   information to interface related logistics systems for assets reported (i.e., equipment,
   consumables) for the actual locations. The geographical location code of the airfield runway
   should be entered as the prime location.
   8.8.2. PSEUDO Base Code Data. It is built from the base cross-reference with 12 pseudo
   codes assigned for each base cross-reference location. The base cross-reference file must be
   completely updated prior to building this file. This file assigns pseudo codes on the WCDO
   document to be utilized when loading the POB on the supply detail records. When WCDO
   assets are stored at alternate storage locations, the MAJCOM WRMO should provide the
   pseudo code of the ASL to the base WRMO for loading the ASL on the supply record.
      8.8.2.1. (Added-PACAF) The CWRMO will indicate in the WCDO Cover letter if a
      location is an Alternate Storage Location (ASL). If so, the ASL’s Planned Operating
      Base (POB) will be identified for WCDO and WAA planning purposes. The base
      WRMO/NCO will ensure the Pseudo Base Code is correctly loaded. Those units directed
      to store WCDO items for other locations will load the Pseudo Base Code for the out load
      location (POB) and the Pseudo Base Code for the location where the assets are being
      stored (ASL).
   8.8.3. Item Identification Data. Contains data elements that relate the WIC, DoDIC, and Item
   Identity Code (IIC) to the National Stock Number and other indicative data such as
   nomenclature, weight, cube, cost and pre-positioning exception days by geographical
   location code/logistical area/sub-area. The prime WIC, DoDIC, and IIC are contained in-

  group codes 1-33 while the substitute components/end items are in the double asterisk file
  (**).
  8.8.4. War Consumable Factor Data. Contains expenditure-per-sortie factors (EPSF)
  required to compute war consumables as they relate to a specific unit, GEOLOC, MAJCOM,
  Role MDS and or logistical sub area. The WCDO is built by multiplying the EPSFs by the
  sorties outlined in the USAF WMP-4. To ensure war consumables objectives are computed,
  as a minimum, EPSFs must be entered in the war consumable factors file for a logistical area,
  MAJCOM, MDS, and Role.
  8.8.5. Aircraft Planning Factor Data. Contains WMP-5 planning factors (e.g., sortie rates,
  duration, and attrition). Attrition rates are based on the WMP-5. All aircraft assigned by the
  correct MDS (F015AB, not F015A) wartime utilization role must be entered in order to
  update the Command WMP-4 and the war consumable factors.
  8.8.6. Aircraft Oil/Fuel Tank Data. Contains data elements required to compute WCDO fuel
  and oil pre-positioning objectives quantities. Identifies each aircraft’s characteristics for
  internal, external and reserve capacities. It also identifies type and size of external fuel tank
  by MDS.
  8.8.7. End Item and Priority of Build Data. Contains indicative data for munitions complete
  item/round build.
8.9. WCDO Commodity Guidance:
  8.9.1. Missiles. Missiles identified in the WCDO represent the quantity required to support
  approved OPLAN/CONPLAN with TPFDD. HQ USAF/XORW allocates available stocks
  (including production deliveries) to the Commands, and then individual base allocations are
  made by the respective Commands. It is of importance to note that of the WRM missiles
  allocated to a base, some of these assets may be Tactical Air Delivery (TAD) assets.
  Questions concerning the requirement should be addressed through respective Commands to
  HQ USAF/XORW. Bases will not requisition missiles and Mission Oriented Items (MOI)
  since these assets are automatically allocated and distributed by MAJCOM.
  8.9.2. Munitions Items (bombs, cartridges, missiles, flares, pyrotechnic chaff). Munitions are
  computed using the factors in the EPSF data. The quantities shown for each base are
  determined by the activity at that base on the WAAR and EPSF file. WRM consumable
  authorizations, requirements and starter/swing objectives are identified on the WCDO. Initial
  loads will be provided either at the home base or pre-stocked at a forward base, as
  determined by the Air Component Command concerned. Fighter, special operations and
  rescue aircraft are authorized a basic load of ammunition, chaff, and flares for a unit move
  (UMV) role. Bombers are authorized a basic load of bombs, air-to-ground munitions, chaff,
  and flares. Other aircraft are authorized a basic load of chaff and flares as applicable. It is
  important to note that of the WRM munitions allocated to a base, some of these assets may
  be Forward Presence assets and/or Rapid Response Swing Stock (RRSS) assets.
  8.9.3. Munitions Shelf Life. Munitions items must not be stored longer than their established
  shelf life limits. This is especially important for aircrew escape system in FSC 1377 where
  shelf life expiration can endanger crews or cause aircraft grounding. If use rates will not
  prevent shelf life expiration for on-hand stocks, notify respective parent Commands for
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        105


  action. Commands will advise OO-ALC/LIWB of shelf life expiration and ask for
  replacement 730 days before shelf or service life expiration.
  8.9.4. Chaff. Chaff is managed and stored within the munitions storage area (MSA). Only
  explosive activated chaff is required to be stored in the MSA. Chaff and Flare modules
  (dispensers) are managed within base supply. All requirements for base-supply managed
  items are obtained through requisitions, which must be coded to indicate use, i.e., training or
  WRM. MSA managed chaff is requisitioned in the quantities indicated in the WCDO.
  8.9.5. Fuel (Avfuel). The Inventory Management Plan (IMP) is the implementing document
  for pre-positioning of bulk fuel quantities. When Major Commands are tasked to develop
  Bulk Petroleum War Reserve Requirements (BPWRR) for the theater Unified Combatant
  Commander and Defense Energy Support Center, use the most current WMP-4 AMC data or
  the Integrated Consumable Item Support (ICIS) module to complete computations. Use of
  any other source document to compute BPWRR is prohibited. Computations should not
  include Civil Reserve Air Fleet requirements at commercial airfields. Joint use airports will
  be included; however, fuel will not be stocked at these locations. Quantities identified on
  WCDO represent ―requirements‖ to support specific activities as documented in the WAAR
  (WMP-4) and are provided for informational purposes only. The quantity reflected in WCDO
  should be supportable within the total authorizations. The Base Fuels Management Flight
  should be consulted to determine adequacy of support.
     8.9.5.1. (Added-PACAF) HQ PACAF/A4R Fuels Manager ensure aviation and ground
     fuel requirements are forwarded to DLA-Energy for inclusion in the IMP.
  8.9.6. Oil (Avfuel). Oil objectives are based on engine technical orders peacetime planning
  factors. Oil is computed based on quantity fuel consumption oil factor (quantity required per
  gallon of fuel burned) indicated in the WAAR.
  8.9.7. De-icing Fluid. This commodity is normally pre-positioned in bulk or 55-gallon drum
  quantities depending on location and storage capabilities. The National Stock Number for
  bulk with a unit of issue of gallon (GL) is used in the WCDO. If the WCDO quantity is equal
  to or greater than one-half the quantity required to de-ice one aircraft, the authorization is
  increased to the quantity required to de-ice one whole aircraft. If the WCDO quantity is less
  than one-half the quantity required to de-ice one aircraft, the requirements are deleted.
     8.9.7.1. (Added-PACAF) Local-source requisitioning is authorized to replace deicing
     fluid stored in tanks. When stored in 55-gallon drums, stored quantity exceeding the
     authorized quantity is approved for that 55-gallon drum only.
  8.9.8. Gaseous Oxygen (280X). WCDO authorizations provide no allowance to maintain
  cylinder pressure (reference TO 42B5-1-2, Use, Handling and Maintenance Instructions--
  Storage Type Gas Cylinders). Pre-stock only quantities that cannot be furnished by the
  supply source in emergencies.
     8.9.8.1. (Added-PACAF) Cylinder accountability, identification, status, marking,
     tagging, and labeling will be in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, Volume I, Part One,
     Chapter 4; AFMAN 23-110, Volume I, Part One, Chap 10W; and AFMAN 23-110,
     Volume II, Part Two, Chap 21M. Cylinders containing WCDO will be marked in
     accordance with AFI 25-101, attachment 5.

  8.9.9. Liquid Oxygen (290X). LOX quantities are for planning purposes only to ascertain the
  adequacy of on-base production capability to meet WRM requirements. Where generating
  plants exist, total base requirements for wartime support, not just flightline demand, should
  be considered. No allowance has been made for losses due to natural boil off. Pre-position
  only quantities which cannot be furnished by the supply source in emergencies.
  8.9.10. Argon Gas (255X). The Base Fuels Management Flight, IAW AFM 23-110, Vol I,
  Part Three, Chapter 4, manages WRM requirements for this item.
  8.9.11. Liquid Nitrogen (270X). Liquid nitrogen is pre-positioned for use in both liquid and
  gaseous form. Pre-positioning of liquid nitrogen for gaseous nitrogen servicing requirements
  should be accomplished only if local capability includes liquid to gaseous
  conversion/servicing units. Address questions regarding requisitioning of this commodity to
  MAJCOM.
  8.9.12. Film/Chemical. WCDO identification of film and chemical requirements is
  standardized whenever possible to ensure compatibility between overseas and CONUS
  operating locations. Primary operating stock (POS) preference is not a primary consideration
  and will not be considered as justification for WCDO change. Although suitable substitutes
  on hand in POS may be used as necessary to satisfy the WRM requirement at the time of
  deployment, pre-positioned quantities at wartime locations are based on prime item
  identification from the WCDO. Deploying units can anticipate having to make some
  adjustments to processing techniques depending on specific film and chemical combinations
  pre-positioned. Any ―incompatibility‖ between specific items pre-positioned and
  cameras/weapon systems to be employed should be identified by specific technical order
  reference to MAJCOM Intelligence. If normal operational levels meet the gross wartime
  requirements, no acquisition is needed. Acquisition and retention should be made on specific
  items that are compatible with camera configuration installed on aircraft.
  8.9.13. Firefighting Agent. NSNs reflected are for planning purposes only. Actual storage
  will be based on local fire department criteria.
      8.9.13.1. (Added-PACAF) The PACAF Command Fire Chief will determine
      firefighting agent requirements for each location. These commodities will be included in
      the WCDO using the Special Item load of the WMP4-CW.
  8.9.14. Airborne weapons (Guns, Gun Barrels and Spare Parts). Guns and gun barrels
  requirements are computed on the basis of factors in the EPSF file.
  8.9.14. (Added-PACAF) Halon 1301 (Bromotrifluoromethane) and Halon 1211
  (Bromochlorodifluoromethane) is a mission-critical, out-of-production asset supporting
  weapon system fire suppression system as an extinguishing agent. Halon 1301 and Halon
  1211 is Class I Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) and is also considered a ―Hazardous
  Material‖. Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 is regulated and managed by the following:
  8.9.14.1. (Added-PACAF) AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management (Para 4.4
  through 4.4.4.4.3. delineates AF Class I ODS requisitioning roles and responsibilities).
      8.9.14.2. (Added-PACAF) AFJMAN 23-227(IP), Storage and Handling of Liquefied
      and Gaseous Compressed Gasses and their Full and Empty Cylinders.

      8.9.14.3. (Added-PACAF) T.O. 42B5-1-2, Compressed Gas Cylinders (Storage Type),
      Use, Handling, and Maintenance.
   8.9.15. (Added-PACAF) Unique and challenging requirements exist when requisitioning,
   storing, handling and maintaining Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 assets. Halon 1301 and Halon
   1211 is only used in support of weapon systems during actual wartime deployment. Asset
   stock rotation is a particular challenge. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) was assigned
   the mission of managing the Defense Reserve of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) to
   ensure that the supplies for mission critical use are available. DLA provides the central
   management for the receipt, storage, and issuance through the Defense Supply Center
   Richmond (DSCR), which is the activity within DLA that manages these substances. The
   Defense Depot Richmond Virginia (DDRV) is the initial storage site for ODS. DLA stores
   the USAF stockpile in enclosed facilities, with leak monitoring systems and special
   procedures for inspecting, sampling, and occasionally rotating the storage cylinders handled
   by trained personnel. These measures ensure that the USAF Halon 1301 and Halon 1211
   will be there and meets Military Performance Specification (MILSPEC) whenever required
   by USAF units.

                                 Chapter 9 (Added-PACAF)

                             MANAGEMENT OF VEHICLES

9.1. (Added-PACAF) Purpose. This chapter describes the specific management policies and
procedures required for WRM vehicles prepositioned in PACAF.
9.2. (Added-PACAF) Objectives.
   9.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Provide sufficient guidance to Logistics Readiness personnel who
   store, inspect, maintain or otherwise care for WRM vehicles in PACAF.
   9.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Provide a reference for all personnel that require WRM vehicles
   during wartime or contingencies.
9.3. (Added-PACAF) Total Fleet Concept.
   9.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Vehicle support capability for wartime or contingency operations
   consists of peacetime operational fleet; assets gained from intra-theater (local) sources, and
   prepositioned WRM assets.
   9.3.2. (Added-PACAF) The use of LIMS-EV Vehicle View and the Consolidated Request
   Information System (CRIS) are mandatory within PACAF. Applicable reports found in
   LIMS-EV and CRIS may be used in lieu of forms, letters and other documentation prescribed
   in this chapter.
   9.3.3. (Added-PACAF) 7AF/A4R Transportation is responsible for fleet management for
   Korea COBs and is the focal point for all WRM related vehicle issues associated with 7AF
   organizations, including Osan and Kunsan
9.4. (Added-PACAF) Waivers. Waiver requests pertinent to vehicle management, conflicting
with this instruction will be approved by the Command WRMPM and/or Air Staff as
appropriate.
9.5. (Added-PACAF) Prepositioning and Storage Concepts.
   9.5.1. (Added-PACAF) WRM vehicles are prepositioned at Base of Planned Use (BPU) to
   the fullest extent possible to support wartime or contingency operations. BPU locations are
   identified in the BPU block on the Vehicle Authorization Listing (VAL). Requests for BPU
   changes must be coordinated through the WRMO, unit commander or equivalent and
   approved by the WRM Review Board prior to submittal to PACAF/A4R and the CWRMO.
   9.5.2. (Added-PACAF) WRM vehicles, excluding integrated WRM, will either be stored in
   ―active‖ (ready-to-roll) condition or ―inactive‖ (deep) storage. PACAF/A4REV (Vehicle
   Management) in coordination with local LRS’ and functional users will determine the
   appropriate mix of integrated, active and inactive stored vehicles.
       9.5.2.1. (Added-PACAF) At Det 1, 36 MSG, Diego Garcia, the WRM vehicle fleet will
       be a mixture of inactive, active, and JU, as determined by Det 1, 36 MSG and
       PACAF/A4REV. Vehicles in inactive storage will not be released without proper
       approval IAW Chapter 6.
   9.5.3. (Added-PACAF) Active-stored vehicles are defined as critical to support base
   reception and immediate sortie generation. Composition of the active fleet will be based
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         109


   upon the needs of the initial incoming forces and immediate aircraft sortie generation
   requirements. These assets must be operationally ready to meet its wartime tasking. Dense-
   packing of active stored vehicles in covered facilities is the preferred method of storage.
   Storing WRM resources on K-loaders is not permitted. The use of semi-trailers to store
   WRM resources should be carefully evaluated to ensure landing gears will support the load
   over extended periods.
   9.5.4. (Added-PACAF) Inactive vehicles must be stored in fully enclosed buildings. Dense
   packing is preferred to maximize use of available floor space. If facility limitations preclude
   enclosed storage of inactive vehicles then they must be maintained in active stored status
   until such time space becomes available. Once vehicles are placed in inactive storage, every
   effort will be made to minimize their use. Additional WRM storage requirements shall be
   identified and submitted to the installation WRMO to be addressed at the next WRM Review
   Board.
   9.5.5. (Added-PACAF) Integrated vehicles, due to their design, must be used at a
   frequency sufficient to ensure serviceability. WRM requirements for refueling, fluid
   dispensing, crash, fire and rescue, deicers, ADR, latrine service trucks, Calivars, 463L
   Materials Handling Equipment (MHE), and specialized medical vehicles should be integrated
   to the fullest extent possible IAW this instruction. Local conditions and/or restrictions may
   require coordination between the Vehicle Management function and the functional user to
   integrate some vehicle types on a rotational basis. The maximum quantity, by type, will not
   exceed the quantity identified on the VAL. WRM integrated and active stored vehicles of the
   same type must be rotated at least every 12 months (unless rotated with peacetime assets) to
   ensure total fleet optimum aging. Non-integrated WRM fuels servicing trucks (R-9/R-11)
   maintained in active storage will be functionally tested at least once a month by vehicle
   maintenance personnel and every 14 days by Fuels Flight personnel. Monthly, one joint
   functional check should be conducted by Transportation and Fuel personnel.
      9.5.5.1. (Added-PACAF) Costs associated with operational use and maintenance of
      integrated WRM vehicles will be funded on the same basis as the unit’s daily use
      vehicles.
9.6. (Added-PACAF) Authorizations.
   9.6.1. (Added-PACAF) Total authorizations reflect the minimum vehicles required, by type
   to support the worst case OPLAN/contingency scenario for a specific base/location for in-
   place and augmentation/deployed forces. Vehicles can be added to the VAL as pure WRM
   after all other sources (lease, host nation support, JU, etc.) of vehicle support have been
   considered. An exception to this policy are those vehicles unique to a unit’s mission and
   required to deploy as part of a UTC/OPLAN and/or notional tasking by higher headquarters.
   As a general rule, PACAF units will not deploy vehicles in support of OPLANs unless the
   assets are identified as use code ―A‖ (mobility) on the PACAF VAL. Request to add
   mobility authorizations to the PACAF VAL must be justified through the requesting unit’s
   fleet management office, and approved by the requesting organization’s MSG/CC. For
   adding mobility authorizations to Korea COBs, requests will be forwarded to 7AF/A4 for
   approval. If approved, 7AF/A4R, Transportation, will forward request to PACAF/A4R for
   final approval.
9.7. (Added-PACAF) Authorization Source.
 110                                      AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


   9.7.1. (Added-PACAF) The VAL is the authorization source document for WRM vehicles
   and must be reconciled with the WPARR Part Two requirements. The VAL is a composite
   listing of approved vehicle authorizations including the peacetime operational fleet, WRM,
   JU and other vehicle requirements provided by PACAF. Table 9.1 identifies types of vehicle
   authorizations. Fleet Management will ensure Vehicle Management is aware of all vehicles
   identified as use code A, mobility, and WRM vehicles that are projected to out load to
   alternate locations.

                                            JU are not classified as WRM, therefore are not subject
                                            to the control/inspection criteria of this instruction. JU
                                            is a peacetime asset filling a WRM requirement.

                                            centrally procured sources. Such sources include but
                                            are not limited to: Host Nation, commandeered POVs,
                                            other services vehicles, Army Air Force Exchange
                                            Service (AAFES), NAF, Force Support functions,
                                            contractors, commercial rental/lease, etc. General
                                            purpose vehicles and commercially available special
                                            purpose vehicles will not be procured or pre-positioned
                                            as WRM if they are available on the local economy or
                                            through host-nation support.

   9.7.2. (Added-PACAF) Using MAJCOMs WRMOs will submit WRM vehicle
   requirements via WPARR Part I to the PACAF CWRMO. The PACAF CWRMO will
   provide those requirements to PACAF/A4REV for review and validation. Upon validation,
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        111


  VAL updates will be accomplished by PACAF/A4REV in coordination with the PACAF
  CWRMO.
  9.7.3. (Added-PACAF) WRM vehicle requirements will be validated during the Base
  Support Plan (BSP) process. Updates requiring modification to the VAL will be coordinated
  with the host WRMO and a recommended approval/disapproval by the MSG/CC. Final
  approval/disapproval rests with PACAF/A4REV in coordination with the CWRMO. For
  Korea COBs, requirements will be validated by 7AF/A4R, Transportation and 7AF/A4
  WRMO, prior to submitting to HQ PACAF.
  9.7.3.1. (Added-PACAF) PACAF does not normally purchase/procure commercial design
  general and special purpose vehicles of less than 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight
  (GVW) to fill WRM requirements. Additive vehicle requirements that fall into this category
  will be sourced through lease, host nation, and redistribution of peacetime operating stocks
  (to include OGMVCs and Non-Appropriated Fund vehicles). However, additive WRM
  requirements that are to be sourced through lease or host nation support will be added to the
  VAL once the requirements are validated.
  9.7.4. (Added-PACAF) Deployed/augment forces integrate with host base units therefore,
  vehicles are authorized by function (not unit) on the VAL. The vehicles authorized for a
  functional area is based on the unit’s worst case planning scenario and issued to the host base
  functional area at execution of a contingency.
  9.7.5. (Added-PACAF) Transportation planners will develop a base vehicle support plan
  for inclusion to the transportation chapter of the BSP. This chapter includes vehicle
  requirements by functional user; procedures to redistribute peacetime operating stocks as
  needed; out load WRM vehicles to alternate use locations; issue WRM vehicles to base
  functional areas, and recalled JU and integrated vehicles for redistribution to wartime users.
  Once vehicle requirements are identified, transportation planners must compare with the
  inbound and outbound vehicles reflected in the OPLAN TPFDD. If TPFDD adjustments are
  required to reflect BSP requirements, they need to be submitted to PACAF/A4REV for
  updating. The VAL will be reviewed to ensure vehicle types, quantities, using activities, and
  use codes are accurately identified. Vehicle shortages will be evaluated to determine if
  shortfalls or Limiting Factors (LIMFAC) exist. Shortfalls and LIMFACs will be included in
  the BSP. However, all workarounds, to include redistribution of peacetime operating stocks
  (vehicles, Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyance (OGMVC), and NAF resources),
  rental, leasing, local procurement and host nation support, must be explored/implemented
  before vehicle shortages are identified as a shortfall or LIMFAC.
  9.7.6. (Added-PACAF) In the event vehicles are required, the deploying unit should
  coordinate with the deployed location transportation and BSP POC to determine whether
  sufficient vehicles are available at the deployment location. If the unit needs to deploy with
  vehicles due to maintenance concerns and/or shortages at the deployment location, they need
  to obtain approval from PACAF/A4R and the deployed location MSG/CC or equivalent.
  The vehicles will be deployed IAW standing operating procedures (i.e., Limited Technical
  Inspections (LTI), deployed CA/CRL, etc.). For bed down at OPLAN locations, the VAL
  will be used as the source document.
  9.7.7. (Added-PACAF) ADR vehicles are prepositioned at locations determined by
  PACAF/A4/A7 in coordination with PACAF/A4R/A4X.
 112                                        AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


9.7.8. (PACAF) PACAF/A4REP (Fuels) will determine gross wartime requirements for fuel
based on the WAAR and Allowance Standard in coordination with Fuels Flight Commanders.
Bases will provide PACAF/A4REP data to justify peacetime authorizations. After gross wartime
and peacetime requirements have been validated, PACAF/A4REP will coordinate with
PACAF/A4REV and the CWRMO to establish WRM vehicle authorizations.
   9.7.9. (Added-PACAF) Identification of JU. Peacetime operating stocks identified as JU
   will be use coded ―C‖ on the VAL. Peacetime operating stocks that does not have a wartime
   mission and will be transferred to another user during wartime is authorized to be joint used
   (Use Code ―C‖).
9.8. (Added-PACAF) Inspection, Preparation, Storage, and Maintenance. Inspection,
preparation, storage, and maintenance requirements apply to all WRM. These guidelines are
intended to reduce storage and maintenance efforts necessary to implement PACAF policy
concerning inactive storage of WRM vehicles. This will ensure WRM vehicles are maintained
in a ready state, while reducing cost. Vehicle maintenance will accomplish the following:
   9.8.1. (Added-PACAF) Perform a LTI using the procedures contained in T.O. 36-1-191 on
   all vehicles being rotated into the WRM vehicle fleet. Also, perform an LTI on all vehicles
   that have been released from storage prior to returning to storage. All discrepancies that
   affect safety or serviceability of an asset must be corrected prior to placing the asset in
   storage. LTIs must be conducted after required repairs are completed to accurately reflect
   vehicle condition.
   9.8.2. (Added-PACAF) When a WRM vehicle is released for a PACAF or JCS exercise,
   the deployed organization will provide the necessary maintenance personnel to breakout,
   sustain, repair and store released vehicles. The 607MMS/CC and/or, MOB LRS/CC will
   determine when to release deployed maintenance personnel back to their unit; this will be
   contingent on vehicles being returned to storage.
   9.8.3. (Added-PACAF) Report shipping damage immediately upon discovery to Traffic
   Management Office (TMO). If possible take digital photographs. Work with local TMO and
   complete a Report of Discrepancy or Transportation Discrepancy Report as required.
   Forward a copy of the report to PACAF/A4REV and CWRMO.
   9.8.4. (Added-PACAF) Determine corrosion/rust proofing treatment for new vehicles
   received for WRM storage IAW T.O. 36-1-191. If treatment was applied prior to shipment,
   perform an inspection to ensure the corrosion treatment was adequate. If prior treatment is
   determined inadequate, treat vehicles and equipment IAW T.O. 36-1-191. Vehicles rotated
   from the active fleet in WRM storage will be given the same corrosion service as new
   vehicles.
   9.8.5. (Added-PACAF) Check tire condition on vehicles being rotated from active fleet
   into WRM and replace as required. WRM vehicles will have a minimum of 50% of the
   original tread. Inflate tires (include spare if applicable) on WRM vehicles assigned to
   vehicle manufacturer’s recommended pressure. To afford security for installed spare
   wheels/tires, vehicle maintenance will affix a chain or cable, which will be secured using a
   padlock. Attach the key to the vehicle key ring. The extra padlock key will be retained in
   the vehicle records jacket with the spare vehicle key. A minimum of one of five WRM
   vehicles of each type with a bare base deployment designation will be equipped with a spare
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                          113


   tire/wheel, jack and lug wrench. Vehicles will retain the spare tire, jack and lug wrench
   supplied by the manufacturer.
   9.8.6. (Added-PACAF) Batteries on inactive stored vehicles assigned to the WRM fleet
   should be disconnected to the fullest extent possible. Use of solargizers to extend battery life
   is discontinued. Program for replacement batteries and include cost in the local budget
   submittal to the WRMO.
   9.8.7. (Added-PACAF) Pintle Hooks. General purpose vehicles under 14,000 Gross
   Vehicle Weight (GVW) (i.e. pickups, metros) will have a minimum of one, pintle hook
   installed for every three assigned by type per fleet. Note: As vehicles are coded for sourcing
   from the host nation or off the local economy, identify gross pintle hook requirements and
   maintain a sufficient quantity of pintle hooks and hardware on-hand for installation during
   wartime or contingency operations.
   9.8.8. (Added-PACAF) Vehicle maintenance will perform modified scheduled inspections
   as required, or when due by hours, miles, or kilometers on active stored vehicles. An annual
   visual inspection will be accomplished for inactive stored vehicles.
   9.8.9. (Added-PACAF) Long-range scheduled maintenance plan will be developed and
   updated each year. The plan should include special provisions for vehicles that will support
   major exercises.
   9.8.10. (Added-PACAF) At Contracted locations, QAEs are primarily vehicle maintenance
   personnel, responsible for monitoring the contractor’s maintenance and exercising of the
   vehicle fleet. Vehicle Maintenance QAE’s will provide technical assistance and training to
   the contractor as required on AF exclusive data support systems.
   9.8.11. (Added-PACAF) The contractor with QAE oversight will perform Vehicle
   Management & Analysis (VM&A) and materiel control functions.
9.9. (Added-PACAF) WRM Vehicle Fleet Management. 7AF/A4R for Korea COBs, and
MOB Fleet Management will manage the vehicle fleet to ensure WRM and peacetime
operational needs are met and will accomplish the following:
   9.9.1. (Added-PACAF) QAEs will develop local procedures, which ensure proper
   accountability and status of stored vehicles.
   9.9.2. (Added-PACAF) Establish procedures for withdrawal of vehicles to support
   contingency plans (breakout plan). Flight Operating Instructions (OI) and/or checklists in the
   unit control center (UCC) may accomplish this.
   9.9.3. (Added-PACAF) Provide VM&A with a listing of WRM vehicles integrated into the
   daily use fleet, by registration number and unit assigned. The receiving unit’s organization
   code (WRM) will be used, (e.g., vehicles integrated to civil engineers have a 3W code, SFS a
   4W org code, etc.).
   9.9.4. (Added-PACAF) Develop local procedures to maintain WRM vehicle status by fleet,
   which includes as a minimum:
      9.9.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Storage fleet being maintained.
      9.9.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Vehicle type.
 114                                          AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


       9.9.4.3. (Added-PACAF) Registration number.
       9.9.4.4. (Added-PACAF) Storage level (i.e., active or inactive)
       9.9.4.5. (Added-PACAF) Storage area (if              applicable)   and   parking   location.
       Unit/location is required for integrated vehicles.
   9.9.5. (Added-PACAF) Establish procedures for control, accessibility, and issue of vehicle
   identification link (VIL) and keys.
9.10. (Added-PACAF) Equipment Support, Care and Exercising. Vehicle Management or
contractor personnel are responsible for the care/exercising of pure WRM vehicles and
accomplishing the following WRM related functions:
   9.10.1. (Added-PACAF) Maintain Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) and Non-
   Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) except for integrated vehicles.
   9.10.2. (Added-PACAF) Monitor due dates of scheduled maintenance (except for
   integrated vehicles) and deliver vehicles scheduled for maintenance action to the vehicle
   maintenance area. Return the vehicles to WRM storage upon completion of maintenance
   action.
   9.10.3. (Added-PACAF) Perform a weekly inspection of the active vehicles to check for
   flat/low tires, accumulation of water in vehicle bodies, evidence of pilferage or theft, leaks,
   and any other obvious defects.
   9.10.4. (Added-PACAF) Develop procedures to ensure vehicles are inspected each quarter
   utilizing appropriate vehicle operator checklists.
       9.10.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Vehicles in active storage will have at least the following
       operator maintenance performed during the quarterly check:
          9.10.4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Change tires as required.
          9.10.4.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Check tire pressure.
          9.10.4.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Check coolant, oil, and automatic transmission fluid
          level.
          9.10.4.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Change light bulbs as required.
          9.10.4.1.5. (Added-PACAF) Clean and service battery.
          9.10.4.1.6. (Added-PACAF) Tighten all loose screws and bolts.
          9.10.4.1.7. (Added-PACAF) Check fuel (maintain at a minimum of ¾ full).
          9.10.4.1.8. (Added-PACAF) Check wiper blades, and replace as necessary.
          9.10.4.1.9. (Added-PACAF) Service interior and exterior of vehicles. To ensure
          interior preservation, apply ―Armorall®‖, or equivalent product, to all interior vinyl,
          plastic, rubber, or Plexiglas ® surfaces, including seats (if vinyl), padded dash,
          rubber door gaskets, etc., twice a year or as needed. Exterior surfaces will be waxed
          as needed but not less than twice a year, excluding Chemical Agent Resistance
          Coating (CARC)-painted vehicles.
          9.10.4.1.10. (Added-PACAF) Exercise active stored vehicles once every quarter.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         115


              9.10.4.1.10.1. (Added-PACAF) During exercises, vehicles will be operated for
              a minimum of 20 minutes including warm-up. During this period, vehicles will
              be driven over a predetermined on-base exercise route. Accessory and mounted
              equipment will be operated for a period sufficient to exercise and lubricate all
              moving parts. Hydraulic systems and pumps will be exercised under a normal
              expected load. Certain vehicles will require longer exercise periods. Diesel
              engine-driven vehicles will be operated for a minimum of 30 minutes. Vehicles,
              which have been released and dispatched for use, are not required to be exercised
              during quarter of usage.
              9.10.4.1.10.2. (Added-PACAF) Due to low speed limits on base, it may be
              necessary to make arrangements with base authorities to adjust the speed limit
              within the exercise route parameters in order to exercise specific vehicles. If this
              is not possible, the exercise route may be extended off base but only to the degree
              of adequate exercising. Safety will be of paramount concern and local traffic laws
              will apply.
              9.10.4.1.10.3. (Added-PACAF) Checks made during exercises will ensure
              vehicles meet the standards established in T.O. 36-1-191.
9.11. (Added-PACAF) Rotations. WRM vehicles, including ADR will be rotated with
peacetime vehicles when necessary to ensure a balancing of age/hour/miles. Active stored and
integrated WRM vehicles of the same type will be rotated as a minimum, every 12 months.
Inactive stored vehicles will only be considered for rotation after 4 years in storage. For Korea
locations, 7AF/A4R, fleet management, needs to coordinate rotations between MOBs and COBs,
including ADR vehicle sets to ensure the system is capable of handing its rated load capacity.
   9.11.1. (Added-PACAF) WRM vehicles will be included in utilization/rotation analysis.
   PACAF/A4RE and 7AF/A4R, Transportation function, will monitor rotation of vehicles into
   and out of their assigned MOBs and other remote sites as required. Korea COBs are exempt
   from utilization/rotation analysis.
   9.11.2. (Added-PACAF) Vehicles will be rotated from the active, daily use fleet, as
   appropriate upon completion of the annual inspection and resultant repair requirements.
   Inspection of vehicles entering WRM storage must be thorough to assure serviceability
   standards are met (T.O. 36-1-191). AFTO Form 91, Limited Technical Inspection – Motor
   Vehicles, will be used to record the condition of the vehicle at this time. The AFTO Form 91
   will become a permanent part of the record jacket. Unserviceable vehicles will not be rotated
   to WRM status, unless directed by PACAF/A4RE. A vehicle may be assigned to WRM with
   deferred parts ordered at the discretion of the maintenance manager/superintendent when
   safety and serviceability are not compromised. The percentage of WRM vehicles (by vehicle
   type) in replacement codes A-J shall be proportionate to the percentage of A-J vehicles in the
   daily use fleet, unless stated otherwise by PACAF/A4RE.
9.12. (Added-PACAF) Peacetime Vehicles. Peacetime vehicle authorizations are filled before
WRM authorizations. Peacetime vehicles support the daily base mission in addition to
performing wartime functions, whereas pure WRM vehicles are additive to peacetime
authorizations to support augmentation forces and/or increased wartime activity. Vehicles may
be removed from the WRM fleet to fill peacetime authorizations. The following restrictions
apply:
 116                                       AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


   9.12.1. (Added-PACAF) WRM vehicles will not be used to fill authorization requests
   unless approved by PACAF/A4REV.
   9.12.2. (Added-PACAF) The Vehicle removed from WRM must be the same as, or a
   suitable substitute, for the primary NSN authorized stated on the VAL.
   9.12.3. (Added-PACAF) All Records affected by the transfer will be updated.
9.13. (Added-PACAF) Prepositioning/Storage of Pure WRM Vehicles. WRM vehicles will
only be stored at locations where adequate vehicle maintenance is available. This restricts
vehicle storage to MOBs, Korea COBs, and other locations where AF personnel of AF
contracted personnel are assigned. PACAF/A4REV must approve storage of vehicles at all other
locations in coordination with the CWRMO. Bases proposing such storage will submit their
request to PACAF/A4REV with complete justification.
   9.13.1. (Added-PACAF) WRM vehicles will be stored separately from peacetime vehicles
   in a secure, controlled area, approved by the MSG/CC or equivalent. All efforts must be
   made to obtain covered enclosed storage for all WRM vehicles to reduce deterioration, thus
   reducing operating/maintenance costs. Vehicle Operations will develop a WRM vehicle-
   parking plan for all stored WRM vehicles. The plan will include a map of the base with
   active and inactive storage locations identified.
   9.13.2. (Added-PACAF) Active stored vehicles will be parked in such a manner to allow
   for easy access and movement of vehicles. Inactive stored vehicles must be inside enclosed
   facilities, such as a Portamod, K-Span, or warehouse, and will be densely-packed. Densely-
   packing requires that vehicles will be parked as closely together as practical to maximize
   inside storage space while still meeting safety requirements. Assigning Vehicle control
   numbers are suggested, but it is up to the organization to develop a system that will allow
   quick reference to a vehicle and its storage location. Vehicle control numbers may not be
   stenciled on the vehicle. Vehicle control numbers may correspond to the vehicle registration
   number and its assigned parking location.
   9.13.3. (Added-PACAF) Develop a storage plan, to include parking plans.            Items to
   consider when developing storage plans include, but are not limited to:
       9.13.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Vehicle requirements for initial incoming forces (TPFDD
       flow).
       9.13.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Time requirements to restore vehicles (break out) that are in
       inactive storage.
9.14. (Added-PACAF) OLVIMS Organization Codes for WRM Vehicles. The VAL is the
source document to determine OLVIMS organization codes for WRM vehicles.
9.15. (Added-PACAF) Authority for Peacetime WRM Vehicle Release. Associated
correspondence will be retained in accordance with T25-01 R 01.00 and will include the
following documentation:
   9.15.1. (Added-PACAF) Release request.
   9.15.2. (Added-PACAF) Approval from appropriate authority.
   9.15.3. (Added-PACAF) Memo to the WRMO stating the vehicle(s) has been reconstituted
   and returned to storage in a serviceable condition.
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                       117


9.16. (Added-PACAF) Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report. The operator’s
inspection guide and trouble report for each WRM and JU vehicle will be marked on the front of
the form to reflect ―WRM‖ or ―JU‖ status. Active stored WRM vehicles will use an AF Form
1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for the entire year, in addition to the
permanent waiver card/automated waiver listing. Inactive, densely-packed vehicles will us an
AF Form 1800 indefinitely, in addition to the permanent waiver card.
   9.16.1. (Added-PACAF) A new AF Form 1800 will be initiated at the beginning of the
   appropriate calendar year for active stored vehicles. Waivered items will be transferred to
   the permanent waiver card/automated waiver listing. Delayed items will be transferred to the
   new AF Form 1800. The previous AF Form 1800 will be retained for one year.
   9.16.2. (Added-PACAF) When pure WRM vehicles are dispatched, a separate AF Form
   1800 will be initiated and provided to the using activity for the duration of use. The annual
   form stays with the WRM manager. Upon return of the vehicle, any discrepancies annotated
   during use will be transferred to the annual AF Form 1800 and reported to vehicle
   maintenance. The AF Form 1800 used during use will be retained for one month.
   9.16.3. (Added-PACAF) When WRM vehicles are exercised/inspected, the date and
   signature of the individual conducting the inspection will be entered on the back of the AF
   Form 1800. Tire pressure/adjustments will also be annotated on the form.

20    ADR trailer            WRM triangle            (See note 14)         (See note 14)

NOTE:
    1. Do not mark on the outside of a building or enclosed storage shed containing both WRM
    and non-WRM; instead, mark each WRM storage area inside the structure according to the
    table.
    2. Use only one placard. If there is more than one entrance on a given side of the building or
    shed, place near the center of the side with the multiple entrances.
    3. An example is a supply open storage area designated by warehouse location(s)
    4. An example is a dispersed stack of AM-2 matting.
    5. Examples of open storage areas that may or may not be enclosed by a fence or wall are:
    6. A supply open storage area with designated warehouse location.
    7. A storage area for items such as Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) equipment.
    8. An area where vehicles are parked.
    9. Powered equipment is defined as any item, except a vehicle, powered by a diesel or
    gasoline driven engine. Examples include: Powered AGE, ground power generators, water
    purification sets, laundry units, air compressors ADR and light sets ADR.
    10. A placard may be used if it is difficult to find a suitable position to affix a WRM triangle
    in a visible location.
    11. One triangle will be on the side where the controls to operate the equipment are located.
    Recommend a second triangle be placed on the side left open for access by a forklift.
    12. Boxes, crates, canisters or drums need not be individually marked however; if
    circumstances warrant marking, place a six to eight inch WRM triangle on two visible sides
    of the box or crate. (Do not place the triangle where it would be blocked from view) Mark
    canisters or drums with a six to eight inch WRM triangle on each of the round ends.
    13. If POS stocks of film are stored in the refrigerator, then do not mark. Instead mark each
    WRM location inside according to rule 18.
    14. If nets are boxed or crated see rule 8.
    15. Tank crates stacked together need not be marked. See rule eight for marking stacks.
    15a. (Added-PACAF) In PACAF, vehicles can be optionally marked in accordance with
    T.O. 36-1-191, paragraph 2.86. The triangle can be applied (stenciled/painted) to the front
    and rear bumpers or in a conspicuous location on the front and rear of vehicles not having
AFI25-101_PACAFSUP_I 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                      139


  bumpers.


  16. It may be necessary to mark some items with a placard due to the size or shape of the
  items.
  17. There are two options when marking ADR trailers.
  18. If the ADR trailer is marked on the outside, the WRM triangle will be six inches or eight
  inches and placed on each trailer door. All assets inside will be WRM, however, storage of
  non-WRM items can be accommodated provided that:
  19. The non-WRM items are segregated in an area specifically for them.
  20. The non-WRM items are placed in a storage container marked non-WRM.
  21. If the ADR trailer is not marked on the outside, mark each WRM item stored in the
  trailer with a WRM triangle, sign or placard using rules in 7, 16,18, or 19.
  22. Affix a locally fabricated placard to each vehicle designating the WRM base code. Make
  placards moveable and temporarily affix to allow rotation of vehicles without re-stenciling
  (magnetic sign/placards may be used).
  23. In PACAF, vehicles can be optionally marked in accordance with T.O. 36-1-191,
  paragraph 2.86. The triangle can be applied (stenciled/painted) to the front and rear bumpers
  or in a conspicuous location on the front and rear of vehicles not having bumpers.
  24. Munitions are exempt from marking as WRM.

    WRM vehicles were properly documented.
    f. Six WRM vehicles had been used for indirect mission support requirements since last
    surveillance visit. Records were reviewed indicating that proper request, approval, and
    notification of reconstitution for each event was completed.
    g. LGRV’s WRM financial plan and budget execution were reviewed. Documentation
    supported the use of WRM funds for inspection, maintenance, and purchase of parts for use
    coded D vehicles and organizational WRM pallet corrosion program.
4. Open discrepancies from last report:
       00-01 - Nets not stored properly. Observed that a rack was made but nets were not hung.
       By end of inspection all nets were hung. (Closed)
       00-02 - Dunnage too short on one stack of pallets. New tonnage was applied and
       discrepancy was fixed immediately. (Closed)
       00-03 - Vehicle 000000999T is being used and not approved/documented on vehicle log.
       (Vehicle observed being operated on base) In the future WRM Vehicle Manager will
       monitor keys to vehicles closer. (Open)
       00-07 - Vehicle 000666C dirty inside and out. Vehicle was cleaned on the spot. VCO was
       instructed on the requirement to maintain vehicle IAW TOs, clean and free of foreign
       matter. (Closed)
5. New/Repeat Discrepancies:
96-08 - Stair truck still being used without proper notification to this office. WRMPM and the
Vehicle Maintenance Manager have been notified IAW Paragraph 4.8.4 AFI 25-101, so proper
action can take place on items 95-01 and 95-02. (ECD: 12 Jun 01)
6. Other comments: Overall the WRM Manager has a good program, and is trying to comply
with WRM program management procedures, however, there are in-house management
problems that need to be corrected to ensure that this program is in full compliance.
7. Recommend appointed manager make every effort to accompany the WRMO/NCO on all
inspections. POC is MSgt Trap, 123 LRS/LGRR, DSN XXX-XXXX.
