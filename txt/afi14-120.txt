This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-1, Air Force Intelligence Planning
and Operations, 2 April 2004. It defines program management, roles, responsibilities, and procedures for
the US Air Force Tactics Analysis and Reporting Program. This instruction also serves as higher head-
quarters (HHQ) guidance for the development of Air Force Major Command (MAJCOM) Instructions.


1. General:
   1.1. Mission: The mission of the US Air Force Tactics Analysis and Reporting Program (TARP) is to
   analyze and evaluate the operational tactics, training, and employment of air and air defense forces of
   potential adversaries. The TARP reports findings in a format and timeline that satisfies the specific
   needs of US Air Force aircrew, weapons controllers, intelligence personnel, and operational planners.
   The TARP ensures all-source intelligence, to include cryptologic information, is integrated with an
   operational perspective to provide tailored products that support US Air Force tactics development,
   operational planning, and threat replication training.
   1.2. Organization: The TARP is a US Air Force Director of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Recon-
   naissance (HQ USAF/XOI) sponsored program, which is managed by the Air Intelligence Agency
   (HQ AIA) and executed by the MAJCOMs and Numbered Air Forces (NAF) through Tactics Analysis
   Teams (TATs). TATs are organized to support the MAJCOM/NAF’s war fighting Air Component(s)
   and are made up of intelligence and operations personnel with relevant experience appropriate to that
   MAJCOM/NAF Area of Responsibility (AOR)/Area of interest (AOI). Each TAT is supported by a
   Tactics and Adversary Studies Element(s) (TASE), which is manned with cryptologic personnel pro-
   vided by HQ AIA. The TASE serves as the MAJCOM/NAF’s interface to cryptologic data and adver-
   sary tactics expertise, and is located to optimize support for the MAJCOM/NAF and associated Air
   Component(s).
       1.2.1. The following is a current list of MAJCOM/NAF TATs and the supporting TASE.

       2.4.9. Attend the TCC and present TAT related programmatic issues.
    2.5. Tactics and Adversary Studies Element (TASE): TASE forms the TARP's only standing orga-
    nization dedicated to providing adversary tactics analysis information to the supported MAJCOM.
    Each TASE is manned with signals intelligence experts that serve as an interface between the operator
    and the various U.S. and allied intelligence agencies worldwide and are the subject matter experts for
    tactics, training, and employment in their respective AOR/AOI. The mission of the TASE is to gather,
    fuse, and reconstruct adversary event data for presentation to the supported MAJCOM. The TASE
    provides all-source collector, operator, and technical experience not typically available to the opera-
    tional intelligence staff. The partnering between MAJCOM, Air Component, and TASE will be
    responsive to changes and will be realigned as required. During combat, contingency operations, and

     2.5.5. Send a senior TASE representative to the annual TCC (the TASE Chief if possible).

3. Forums
  3.1. Tactics Analysis Team (TAT): Each MAJCOM will organize TATs to support associated warf-
  ighting Air Component(s) with detailed analysis of operational tactics, training, and employment of
  air and air defense forces of potential adversaries. The TAT will provide findings in a format and time-
  line that satisfies the specific needs of aircrew, weapons controllers, intelligence personnel, and oper-
  ational planners to support tactics development, operational planning, and threat replication training.
  MAJCOM/NAFs will partner with associated Air Component(s) for assistance in defining the focus
  of study for each TAT with HQ AIA arbitrating between MAJCOM/NAFs to avoid duplication of ana-
  lytical efforts. The number and frequency of TAT meetings per year is determined by the TAT
  co-chairs based on the needs of the supported MAJCOM/NAF.
     3.1.1. TAT Co-Chairs: Each TAT is led by two co-chairs. The Intelligence co-chair (Intel Chair)
     will be an experienced Intelligence Officer appointed by the MAJCOM Director of Intelligence
     (IN). The Operations co-chair (Ops Chair) will be an experienced rated officer appointed by the
     MAJCOM Director of Operations (DO).
     3.1.2. TAT Membership: The TAT is made up of personnel drawn from a wide variety of intelli-
     gence and operations organizations within the Air Force and joint community as well as from spe-
     cific allied partners. A typical TAT is made up of 20-30 core members augmented by specialists on
     specific topics of the meetings. The total membership of a TAT should normally not exceed 60
     personnel. Participation by Weapons School graduates or personnel of equivalent experience is
     highly recommended. Other TAT members are drawn primarily, but not exclusively, from the fol-
     lowing organizations, any or all of which may be invited to fulfill the requirements of a particular
     TAT.
         3.1.2.1. Operational Flying Squadrons: MAJCOM/NAFs will ensure aircrew members with
         significant relevant experience in the appropriate AOR/AOI participate in TAT meetings.
         3.1.2.2. Intelligence Collectors and Analysts: Personnel from the National Security Agency
         (NSA), the Regional Security Operations Centers (RSOCs), airborne collection platforms, and
         other entities with collections experience relevant to the AOR/AOI provide additional intelli-
         gence expertise to the TAT.
         3.1.2.3. Intelligence Production Centers: Analysts from production centers to include but not
         limited to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), the Missile and Space
         Intelligence Center (MSIC), and the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) should be
         invited to provide systems expertise to the TAT as required.
         3.1.2.4. Other DoD Services’ Experts: Operations and intelligence personnel with appropriate
         experience in the AOR/AOI such as PATRIOT operators and Office of Naval Intelligence
         SPEAR.
         3.1.2.5. Air Force Intelligence Analysis Agency (AFIAA).
         3.1.2.6. The 64th Aggressor Squadron.
         3.1.2.7. USAF weapons schools (ACC, Air Force Special Operations Command, AMC) grad-
         uates.
6                                                                           AFI14-120 6 JANUARY 2006


           3.1.2.8. Allied TARP partners’ aircrew and intelligence personnel.
           3.1.2.9. Weapons Controllers.
    3.2. Tactics Analysis Team Working Group: TAT co-chairs convene TAT Working Groups to pro-
    vide timely analysis and reporting of a significant adversary tactics event, or to analyze a specific, nar-
    rowly focused topic. Working group members are typically a subset of the TAT and are selected based
    on the required subject matter expertise.
    3.3. Special Tactics Analysis Team (STAT): Special TAT meetings are held to provide tactics anal-
    ysis on threat capabilities that have a broader impact beyond a single MAJCOM AOR/AOI or to
    address areas not directly supported by an existing TASE. MAJCOMs/NAFs and other agencies will
    provide topics to HQ AIA for analysis by a Special TAT. HQ AIA will assign TAT co-chairs and the
    supporting TASE based on the specific analysis requested.
    3.4. Tactics Analysis Conference (TAC): A TAC is the primary vehicle the TARP uses to present
    TAT findings and related tactics information to forums outside of normal TATs. No tactics analysis is
    performed during the TAC. The intent is to present updates on threat air and air defense capabilities
    and results of previous tactics analysis efforts to operators. SOFTAC, for example, invites TARP per-
    sonnel from throughout the USAF to conduct briefings of interest to Special Operation Forces. The
    SOFTAC is held in lieu of a TAT.
    3.5. Tactics Coordinating Committee (TCC): The TCC addresses and assigns action items for
    TARP issues, reviews MAJCOM guidance, and compiles TAT and TASE funding requirements. The
    TCC convenes annually, but may be called by the HQ AIA TARP Program Manager more often if
    required to resolve significant program issues. Attendance is mandatory for TAT co-chairs and TASE
    chiefs.

4. TARP Products
    4.1. General: The type of operations supported by the TARP dictates the type of reporting accom-
    plished. TAT reporting can take the form of a written report, Tactics Analysis and Production System
    (TAPS) video, formal briefing, verbal presentation, or any combination of the above. The physical
    form of the product is determined by the nature of the request, the event being analyzed, the data
    available, and the time provided to respond.
    4.2. TAT Report: The primary product of the TARP is the TAT report, which is written by operators,
    for operators. As such, an informal writing style utilizing operational jargon is encouraged. The intent
    of the TAT process is to generate a report that is the culmination of the team’s analytical efforts. As
    such, no changes shall be made to the document after the meeting concludes with the exceptions of
    grammar and spelling changes that do not affect the original conclusions. Additionally, details such as
    exact figures, dates and numbers not available at the meeting but deemed essential by the co-chairs
    may be added prior to publication. The TAT report will be released to all MAJCOM units, Guard and
    Reserve units, other US Air Force/Intelligence Community organizations involved in TARP opera-
    tions, and to Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1 Volume 2 Threat Reference
    Guide and Countertactics chapter chairs. TAT reports should be written at the SECRET Collateral
    level, and be releasable to allied partners that participated in the development of the product or are
    involved in operations in the AOR/AOI. Sanitized versions of the reports may be produced for other
    allied or coalition partners that may not have participated in the TAT, but may benefit from its find-
    ings. Supplemental reports at the TOP SECRET Compartmented level are not prohibited.
AFI14-120 6 JANUARY 2006                                                                              7


  4.3. TAT Working Group Report: Working Group reports are governed by the same guidelines as
  outlined for the TAT report.
  4.4. STAT Report: Special TAT reports are governed by the same guidelines as the TAT report.
  4.5. TAC Report: By their nature TACs do not necessarily generate a product. However, if a report
  is issued based on the TAC, original event analysis and/or classifications must remain. Additionally,
  coordination with the originating MAJCOM/NAF’s TAT Intel Chair is required to ensure appropriate
  classification of the final report.
  4.6. Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Products: QRC products are an initial reporting/recon-
  struction of an event that is an immediate concern of the supported MAJCOM/NAF, Air Component,
  theater commanders, and national decision makers. The goal is to gather all available information on
  a distinct event, perform baseline analysis, and report findings as quickly as possible. The QRC sup-
  plements scheduled TAT meetings and Working Groups in that it provides a timely flow of prelimi-
  nary adversary tactics information to consumers. The supported MAJCOM/NAF will originate
  requests for a QRC product. Requests will be made directly to the supporting TASE. Requests for
  QRC reporting from agencies not directly supported by a TASE (e.g. Air Force Intelligence Analysis
  Agency, Joint Survival and Recovery Center, Secretary of Defense, etc.) will be directed to HQ AIA,
  the US Air Force TARP program manager. HQ AIA will assign the QRC tasking to the appropriate
  TASE. QRC products are governed by the same guidelines as outlined for the TAT report.
  4.7. Briefings: TARP products represent a unique all-source evaluation of potential adversary tactics,
  training, and employment capabilities, and as such, every attempt must be made to brief operational
  units whenever possible. Particular attention should be given to providing briefings prior to deploy-
  ments in support of contingencies, combat operations, or multi-national training events. Additionally,
  briefings should be provided at MAJCOM, Joint, and Allied forums as appropriate.
