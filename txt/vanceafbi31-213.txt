2.6. Off–Limits Establishments and Areas.
     2.6.1. The establishment of off–limits areas is a function of command. It may be used by the
     71 FTW/CC to help maintain good order and discipline, health, morale, safety and welfare of
     personnel assigned to the 71 FTW. Off–limits action is also intended to prevent personnel
     from being exposed to or victimized by crime–conducive conditions. Where sufficient cause
     exists, the 71 FTW/CC retains substantial discretion to declare establishments or areas
     temporarily off–limits to personnel assigned to the 71 FTW. Temporary off–limits
     restrictions issued by the 71 FTW/CC in an emergency situation will be acted upon by the
     VDCB as a first priority. As a matter of policy, a change in ownership, management or name
     of any off–limits establishment does not, in and of itself, revoke the off–limits restriction.
     2.6.2. Military members assigned to Vance AFB are prohibited from entering establishments
     or areas declared off–limits according to this instruction. Violations may subject the member
     to disciplinary action per applicable Air Force instructions and the Uniform Code of Military
     Justice. Family members of military personnel and others associated with the installation
     should be made aware of off–limits restrictions. As a general policy, these establishments
     will not be visited by personnel in a law enforcement capacity unless specifically determined
     by the 71 FTW/CC or the board president that a visit or surveillance is warranted.
     2.6.3. Except when emergency situations exist, prior to initiating a VDCB action, the 71
     FTW/CC or board president will attempt to correct adverse conditions or situations through
     the assistance of civic leaders or officials.
     2.6.4. Except when emergency situations exist, prior to recommending off–limits restriction,
     the VDCB will send a written notice (certified mail; return receipt requested) to the
     individual or firm responsible for the alleged condition or situation. In the notice, the VDCB
     will specify a reasonable time for the condition or situation to be corrected, along with the
     opportunity to present any relevant information to the board. If subsequent investigation
     reveals the responsible person has failed to take corrective action, the board will recommend
     the imposition of the off–limits restriction (see para 2.6.1.).
     2.6.5. A specified time limit will not be established when an off–limits restriction is invoked.
     The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the responsible individual will be the
     determining factor in removing an off–limits restriction.
     2.6.6. A person whose establishment or area has been declared off–limits may, at any time,
     petition the president of the board to remove the off–limits restriction. The petition will be in
     writing and will include a detailed report of action taken to eliminate the condition or
     situation that caused imposition of the restriction. The president of the VDCB may direct an
     investigation to determine the status of corrective actions noted in the petition. The board
     will either recommend removal or continuation of the off–limits restriction to the board
     president based on the results of the investigation.
     2.6.7. Off–limits signs will not be posted on civilian establishments by US military
     authorities.
2.7. Meetings.

2.10. Appropriate Areas for Board Consideration.
   2.10.1. The board will study and take appropriate action on all reports of conditions
   considered detrimental to the good order and discipline, health, morale, welfare, safety and
   morals of installation personnel. These adverse conditions include, but are not limited to,
   those identified in paragraph 2.4.1.2.
   2.10.2. The board will immediately forward reported circumstances involving discrimination
   based on race, color, sex, religion, age or national origin to the installation commander.

8                                                          VANCEAFBI31-213 14 JUNE 2012


    2.11.1. Off–limits restrictions should be invoked only when there is substantive information
    indicating an establishment or area frequented by 71 FTW personnel presents conditions
    which adversely affect their health, safety, welfare, morale or morals. It is essential the
    board does not act arbitrarily and actions must not be of a punitive nature. The board should
    work in close cooperation with local officials and proprietors of business establishments and
    seek to accomplish their mission through mutually cooperative efforts. The board should
    encourage personal visits by local military and civilian enforcement or health officials to
    establishments considered below standard. The VDCB should point out unhealthy conditions
    or undesirable practices to establishment owners or operators to produce the desired
    corrective action.
    2.11.2. In cases involving discrimination, the board should not rely solely on letters written
    by the Equal Opportunity Office and Military Affairs Committee or investigations of alleged
    racial discrimination.
    2.11.3. If the board decides to attempt to investigate or inspect an establishment, the
    president or a designee will prepare and submit a report of findings and recommendations at
    the next meeting. This procedure will ensure complete and documented information
    concerning questionable adverse conditions.
    2.11.4. When the board concludes that conditions are adverse to military members, the
    owner or manager will be sent a letter of notification (see Attachment 2). This letter will
    advise him or her to raise standards by a specified date and if such conditions or practices
    continue, off–limits proceedings will be initiated. Any correspondence with the individuals
    responsible for adverse conditions which may lead to off–limits action will be delivered by
    certified mail.
    2.11.5. If a proprietor takes remedial action to correct undesirable conditions previously
    noted, the board should send a letter of appreciation (see Attachment 3) recognizing this
    cooperation.
    2.11.6. If undesirable conditions are not corrected, the proprietor will be invited to appear
    before the VDCB to explain why the establishment should not be placed off–limits (see
    Attachment 4). Any proprietor may designate, in writing, a representative to appear before
    the board on his or her behalf.
    2.11.7. In cases where proprietors have been invited to appear before the board, the president
    of the board will perform the following:
       2.11.7.1. Prior to calling the proprietor:
           2.11.7.1.1. Review the findings and decision of the previous meeting.
           2.11.7.1.2. Call for inspection reports.
           2.11.7.1.3. Allow those present to ask questions and discuss the case.
       2.11.7.2. When the proprietor or his or her representative is called before the board:
           2.11.7.2.1. Present the proprietor with a brief summary of the complaint concerning
           the establishment.
           2.11.7.2.2. Afford the proprietor an opportunity to present matters in defense.
VANCEAFBI31-213 14 JUNE 2012                                                                  9


          2.11.7.2.3. Invite those present to question the proprietor. After the questioning
          period, provide the proprietor an opportunity to make a final statement before being
          dismissed.
   2.11.8. Deliberations on recommended actions will be in closed session, attended only by
   board members.
   2.11.9. The board should recommend off–limits restriction only after the following:
      2.11.9.1. The letter of notification (see Attachment 2) has been sent.
      2.11.9.2. An opportunity for the proprietor to appear before the board has been extended.
      2.11.9.3. Further investigation indicates that improvements have not been made.
   2.11.10. The minutes will indicate the VDCB’s action in each case. When a recommendation
   is made to place an establishment off–limits, the minutes will show the procedural steps
   followed in reaching the decision.
   2.11.11. Recommendations of the VDCB will be submitted to the 71 FTW/CC for approval.
   2.11.12. Upon approval of the VDCB’s recommendations, the president will inform the
   proprietor in writing, that the off–limits restriction has been imposed (see Attachment 5).
   2.11.13. A time limit should not be specified when an off–limits restriction is imposed. The
   adequacy of the corrective action taken by the proprietor of the establishment must be the
   determining factor in removing the off–limits restriction.
   2.11.14. In emergencies, the 71 FTW/CC may temporarily declare establishments or areas
   off–limits to personnel assigned to the 71 FTW (see Attachment 6). The circumstances for
   the action will be reported as soon as possible to the VDCB. Detailed justification for this
   emergency action will be provided to the board for its deliberations.
   2.11.15. The VDCB will publish a list of off–limits establishments and areas using 71
   FTW/PA media channels or other available means to promote widest possible dissemination.
2.12. Removal of Off–Limits Restrictions.
   2.12.1. Removal of an off–limits restriction requires VDCB action and approval by the 71
   FTW/CC. Proprietors of establishments declared off–limits should be advised they may
   petition the appropriate VDCB at any time. In their petition, they should submit the reason
   why the restriction should be removed. A letter of notification for continuance of the off–
   limits restriction should be sent to the proprietor, if the sponsoring commander does not
   remove the off–limits restriction (see Attachment 7). The proprietor may appeal to the next
   higher commander after exhausting all appeals at the local sponsoring commander level. The
   VDCB shall appoint a designee who should make at least quarterly inspections of off–limits
   establishments. A statement that an inspection has been completed should be included in
   VDCB minutes.
   2.12.2. When the board learns the proprietor has taken adequate corrective measures, the
   VDCB will take the following actions:
      2.12.2.1. Discuss the matter at the next meeting and make an appropriate
      recommendation.

      2.12.2.2. Forward a recommendation for removal of the off–limits restriction to the
      board president. If approved, a letter removing the restriction (see Attachment 8 or
      Attachment 9) will be sent to the proprietor.
      2.12.2.3. Reflect action taken in the minutes.
2.13. Minutes.
