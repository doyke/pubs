                                            Chapter 1

             AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The AEF is the Air Force’s force generation construct used to manage the battle
rhythm of expeditionary forces in order to meet global CCDR requirements while maintaining
the highest possible level of overall readiness. Through the AEF, the Air Force establishes a
predictable, standardized battle rhythm ensuring rotational forces are properly organized, trained,
equipped, and ready to sustain capabilities while rapidly responding to emerging crises. Through
the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of both
permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
     1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) readiness reporting.
     This instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-401 Air Force Operations
     Planning and Execution, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full
     description of AEF concepts. In cases where this AFI and AFI 10-401 contradict, AFI 10-401
     will take precedence. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of the AEF and AEF UTC
     Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting.
     Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
1.2. Reporting AEF Readiness - General. To view the health of USAF forces postured in the
UTC Availability (UTA), Air Force senior leadership determined the need to collect UTC
readiness data from ART reportable units in sufficient detail to support the following goals:
     1.2.1. Provide HQ USAF, AF Component Commanders, AF components to Joint Force
     Providers (JFPs), MAJCOM's, and the Directorate of Air and Space Expeditionary Forces
     Operations (AFPC/DPW) readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain AEF
     operations.
     1.2.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC’s ability or inability to fulfill its Mission
     Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full range of military operations (ROMO), to
     include contingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within
     the UTC.
     1.2.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
     state and crisis actions.
1.3. System Description. The AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART) allows units the ability to
report UTC level readiness data. It provides one central location to archive reported data. It
allows immediate updates and ready access to an aggregate UTC status for all levels of
command with sufficient depth of information to make informed decisions on the employment of
forces for AEF operations. It further provides a means for identifying and analyzing actionable
indicators of change.
     1.3.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases
     to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness
     data. It resides on the SIPRNET (https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil) for secure access.
     Units that have standard UTCs postured in UTC Availability (UTA) view and report their
     status against these UTCs directly within the ART application.
AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013                                                         5


  1.3.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to
  produce tailored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be
  accessed by anyone with SIPRNET access and an AEF Online account.
  1.3.3. A fully functional training site will be maintained by AFPC/DPW. This site allows
  personnel to review the ART tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this
  site; anyone can login and enter training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT
  enter real world data on the training site.
  1.3.4. Operationally, ART collects and collates unit-reported data to answer, in whole or in
  part, the following questions:
     1.3.4.1. Are UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP?
     1.3.4.2. Are UTCs able to accomplish their deployment tasking?
     1.3.4.3. Are adequate resources and training available in order to accomplish and sustain
     the AEF mission(s)?
  1.3.5. ART complements readiness data reported in the Status of Resources and Training
  System (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular, scalable capability-based UTCs
  designed to meet the needs of the AEF while SORTS is unit-centric.
     1.3.5.1. (Added-ANG) . The ANG’s Global Force Management and Adaptive Planning
     Branch (NGB/A3XW) is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for maintaining ANG
     UTCs in the UTC Availability (UTA).

                                            Chapter 2

                           ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate
information at all levels. Within the AEF construct, the UTC assessments are used to determine
the most effective force tasking. When unit commanders present the readiness of each postured
UTC in ART, they provide higher levels of command the necessary information to make force
and resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders. For this reason,
integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card, but identifies a
UTCs ability to perform its MISCAP and identify shortages of resources. Therefore,
commanders must "tell it like it is."
2.2. Headquarters USAF.
     2.2.1. Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF). Responsible for organizing, training, and
     equipping air, space, and cyber forces to meet CCDR requirements.
     2.2.2. Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans, and Requirements (HQ USAF/A3/5).
     Oversees AEF operational planning and represents the Air Force on all AEF policy and
     doctrine to include all matters involving the scheduling, sourcing, operation planning, and
     presentation of AEF capabilities. Coordinates AF-wide efforts to develop capabilities and
     field AEF forces and the associated operational-level C2 infrastructure and units. Coordinates
     with MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs, AFPC/DPW, and USAF component commands to ensure
     unity in the AEF implementation effort. Oversees AEF operational planning and concept
     development. Conducts analysis of operational concepts supporting AEF operations through
     the Air Force Studies and Analysis Agency.
        2.2.2.1. Directorate, Operational Planning, Policy and Strategy (HQ USAF/A5X). USAF
        focal point for developing and integrating operational strategies, requirements, policies,
        guidance, and plans necessary to support AEF operations worldwide supporting the war
        fighter. AF OPR on UTC efforts, AEF libraries (UTA), Joint Strategic Capability Plan
        (JSCP) issues, AEF sourcing issues, FAM interface, and AEF relationship to OPLAN
        guidance. The War and Mobilization Planning Policy Division (A5XW) develops general
        policies regarding all facets of the AEF, of UTCs and the general guidelines for assigning
        postured UTCs to the AEF construct. They are responsible for managing the UTA in
        DCAPES, but not for the actual updating of available UTCs.
        2.2.2.2. Directorate of Operations (HQ USAF/A3O). Responsible for overall AF current
        operations, readiness and training. Administers policies governing operational training,
        force readiness, range and airspace issues, personnel recovery, and special plans and
        programs. As the OPR for AF readiness, this directorate coordinates with AFPC/DPW on
        force readiness issues for AEF operations.
     2.2.3. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support (HQ
     USAF/A4/7). Develops policy and provides guidance for all logistics plans, transportation,
     supply, maintenance, civil engineer, security forces, and munitions support. Acts as HQ
     USAF lead for developing Agile Combat Support (ACS) capabilities, and appropriately
     sizing these capabilities as Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS), to support AEF operations.

   2.2.4. Air Staff Functional Area Managers (FAMs). The Air Staff FAM acts as a central
   coordinator of the actions of their MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs counterparts to ensure their
   applicable functional area UTCs are being properly assigned to the AEF construct. (See AFI
   10-401 for additional Air Staff FAM responsibilities). Monitor MAJCOM reporting to
   identify trends and elevate UTC shortfalls and deficiencies for resolution to maximize
   deployable resources.
   2.2.5. Commander, Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC/CC dual-rolled as HQ
   USAF/RE). Establishes policy and provides guidance for the participation of AFRC forces in
   AEF operations.
   2.2.6. The Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF). Establishes policy and provides
   guidance for the participation of Air National Guard (ANG) forces in AEF operations.
       2.2.6.1. (Added-ANG) . The ANG Readiness Assessment Branch (NGB/A3XR) is the
       ANG’s point of contact for the AEF Reporting Tool (ART) and is responsible for
       maintaining current ANG policy/guidance.
   2.2.7. For a more complete description of roles and responsibilities for AEF see AFI 10-401.
2.3. Air      Force      Personnel      Center     Directorate      of     AEF      Operations
(AFPC/DPW). AFPC/DPW is a cross-functional, centralized management team responsible for
planning, configuring, scheduling, and preparing AEFs. Responsibilities specifically include
AEF scheduling for steady state operational requirements. The AFPC/DPW integrates trained
aerospace forces to meet theater CCDRs' requirements. Included in this is responsibility for
working with the Air Force Operations Group during crisis action planning and with HQ
USAF/A3/5 for force reconstitution planning. Identifies escalated reconstitution requirements
when force commitment exceeds sustainment levels. Coordinates with MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs
to identify units in surge operations and those that require reconstitution. Monitors personnel,
training, equipment, and supply status throughout surge operations, advising Air Staff of critical
impacts to on-call operations, the AEF schedule, and Major War (MW) execution.
   2.3.1. Authority. AFPC/DPW is the CSAF designated coordinating authority for executing
   the Air Forces battle rhythm and delivering versatile air and space power. Accordingly,
   AFPC/DPW is direct liaison authorized (DIRLAUTH) across all MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs,
   AF Component Commands (AFCCs), and deployed units to provide readiness oversight and
   to integrate required planning and sourcing processes. Although AFPC/DPW has no chain of
   command authority with AEF units, it may use ART information for recommending courses
   of action to the AF leadership to facilitate expeditionary operations, to include
   recommending sourcing and tasking during crisis planning.
       2.3.1.1. (Added-ANG) ANG liaisons at the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC/DPW)
       function as advisors to NGB/A3XR on current policies, procedures and information
       relating to the ART Program.
   2.3.2. ART Operation. AFPC/DPW is the system manager for ART. UTA is the data source
   for ART and is uploaded to ART weekly to incorporate changes made to AF posturing. As
   the manager for ART and coordinating authority for AEF operations, AFPC/DPW advises
   HQ USAF A1, A3/5 and CSAF on readiness issues pertaining to AEF. It advises on AF

                                  REPORTING GUIDANCE

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on
all personnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. All ART assessment data
and aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive Order (EO) 12958. Do not
enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special Access Required" information
or Privacy Act of 1972. ART is not Privacy Act compliant.
3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security
Information, requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities.
Additionally, this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and
declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating in a new form, information that is already classified, and marking the
   newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source
   information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must
       carry forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the
       original source or document.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks,
       and limiting factors) for a single UTC, is classified SECRET.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments) are classified
       SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its
       impact on national security if released. This covers any use of ART data in other forms
       (briefings, presentations, e-mails, etc) with the desire to circumvent classification
       guidance.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is
       classified IAW its original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating or
       used in an ART worksheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance. Preformatted
       worksheets should be clearly marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. ART combines elements of the JOPES database with
       unit readiness assessment information. Information extracted from this database is
       classified IAW CJCSI 3401.02 and CJCSM 3150.02 and must contain derivative
       classification markings consistent with EO 12958, except where authorized otherwise.
       Derivative classification rules apply when extracts contain exempted data.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark
       documents or data “DERIVED FROM: AFI 10-244, Declassify on: (date).” The date of
       declassification is 10 years from the date of the document for each level of classification.
       3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and
       aggregate information will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the authority to
 16                                            AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013


       extend or accelerate downgrading classification of ART and SORTS data following an
       initial determination by CJCS.
3.3. Global Force Management. The AF currently uses a Tempo Banding construct to present,
schedule and deploy its forces. ART reports readiness of AF resources to support both
Contingency and Crisis Action planning processes. To meet both rotational scheduling
(traditional AEF type) and crisis response scheduling, it is vital to determine which band/block
for which FY is visible at what time. That visibility process is managed by AFPC/DPWPA in
conjunction with AF/A5XW and is based on business rules to ensure the best data is visible at
the right time to provide the best sourcing solution. AF/A5XW publishes the execution
vulnerability windows for all the upcoming band/blocks along with guidance under which FY
each of those band/blocks will execute.
3.3.1. Business rules for determining if a Band/Block is visible in ART:
       3.3.1.1. Blocks are made visible in ART NLT 8 months prior to execution of that block.
       The purpose of the '8-Month Rule' is to give all units 2 months to review and assess the
       new cycle data before standard sourcing begins. It is understood that in some rare
       occasions that units postured in the current FY but not in the next FY, may lose visibility
       of that resource in ART when the 8-Month Rule brings the next cycle into ART. Units
       undergoing BRAC/Service-directed resource action are one example where this may
       come into play.
       3.3.1.2. Blocks are removed from ART after the availability date has expired.
       3.3.1.3. When an expired block is removed, the next occurrence for that block will be
       added.
       3.3.1.4. Bands or blocks not expected to execute during the FY will have the current FY
       cycle made visible until the 8-month rule comes into effect. This ensures visibility of
       current FY authorizations during that FY even though that resource is not planned to be
       available. The goal is to support crisis sourcing if needed.
       3.3.1.5. Enablers are rolled over from the current FY to the next FY in October of each
       year.
3.3.2. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit’s current cycle and the next cycle; if
applicable to support each postured UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved
UTC/UIC AEF posturing from UTA application in DCAPES. Associate-UTCs (A-UTCs) -
UTCs designated with a posturing code of "A" are not currently reported in ART. ART is not a
posturing tool, it is an assessment tool. For a commander to obtain a complete sight picture as to
what their prospective expeditionary commitments are, they should obtain a database extract for
their respective UICs from UTA and any OPLAN / CONPLAN / FUNCPLAN TPFDD UIC
specific entries.
   3.3.2.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs postured in UTA shall continue to report
   SORTS IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement and AFI 10-201, in
   addition to reporting in ART.
3.4. UTC Readiness Assessments. Assessments are based on all aspects of the UTC to include:
(1) the ability to accomplish the Mission Capability (MISCAP) Statement, (2) the ability to
fulfill the standard manpower requirements, and (3) the ability to fulfill the complete equipment
AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           17


requirements. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) Logistics Detail (LOGDET)
and Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) of the Manpower and Equipment Force
Packaging System (MEFPAK) will be used to maintain the manpower and equipment
requirements.
   3.4.1. Response Time. If a UTC is on a DOC statement, then the UTC readiness assessment
   is based on resources that are expected to be mission ready and available within their DOC
   response time. Unless otherwise directed the UTC must be mission ready and available
   within 72 hours of tasking depending on the UTC requirements.
   3.4.2. MISCAP provides a brief description of the capability for which the UTC is designed
   and may provide authorized substitutions to AFSCs, skill levels, grades, and SEIs. If no
   restrictions or substitutions are listed refer to Attachment 4 for AFSC consideration.
   3.4.3. LOGFOR provides a list of equipment the UTC requires to perform the mission.
   3.4.4. MANFOR contains the manpower detail required to provide the capability for a
   standard UTC.
      3.4.4.1. (Added-ANG) ANG personnel available for deployment are personnel a unit
      commander has Operational Control (OPCON) over who are not on state active duty
      orders under the appropriate state statute. UTCs containing personnel who are on state
      active duty orders may not be available for deployment and therefore, must be degraded
      accordingly for the duration of the orders.
      3.4.4.2. (Added-ANG) AFSC substitutions are authorized in AFI 10-403, Deployment
      Planning and Execution.
   3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to
   provide the UTC for mission execution at any time.
      3.4.5.1. (Added-ANG) Units will not count the same individual or same equipment for
      multiple UTCs. If an individual is positioned in a UTC, he/she will not be
      considered/positioned in an additional UTC for assessment purposes. Double counting of
      personnel or equipment for UTC readiness assessments is prohibited except under special
      circumstances where a waiver has been approved by AF/A5XW IAW procedures in AFI
      10-401.
      3.4.5.2. (Added-ANG) . Student Flight Personnel cannot be counted in UTC readiness
      assessments.
   3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the
   health of the UTC. For example, a unit may have an overall rating of C-3 in GSORTS
   (Global Status of Resources and Training System) but a particular UTC from the unit will be
   assessed Green; conversely a unit may have a C-1 rating but one of its UTCs could be
   assessed Red.
   3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ the
   UTC. Areas to be considered are personnel, training, equipment or supply, and equipment
   condition. Personnel must be fully qualified without deployment limitations and have all
   required mission and skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions.
   Equipment must be serviceable and available for deployment.
18                                            AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013


     3.4.7.1. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR
     equipment and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply
     problems when details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on
     the availability of mission required equipment and supplies. Items are considered
     available if they are assigned to the unit, physically present at the unit or have been
     deployed by the unit with an expectation of return.
     3.4.7.1. (ANG) If the UTC MISCAP requires specific mobility bag assets to complete
     its mission (i.e. NBC Defense Equipment located in the C-Bag), and the UTC is degraded
     due to the non-availability of the item(s), ensure the deficiency is noted in the remarks
     section of the UTC assessment. For example: a UTC is expected to perform it’s MISCAP
     in a CBRNE environment, and the individuals on the UTC do not have all required C-
     Bag assets, then the UTC would be degraded due to the missing items from the C-bag.
     This is the only time mobility bag deficiencies would be reported in the ART database.
         3.4.7.1.1. (Added-ANG) If equipment is used to fill a requirement in one UTC, the
         same equipment cannot be used to fill a requirement in an additional UTC.
     3.4.7.2. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and
     support equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake
     the mission. Units assess the condition of equipment based on whether the available UTC
     required equipment (as determined in paragraph 3.4.7.1.) is in working order and
     mission ready.
     3.4.7.3. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support
     the mission for which a UTC is designed as described in the UTC Mission Capability
     (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC must have all required UTC and skill level
     training completed IAW applicable directives and instructions at the time of assessment.
     Individual training not required by the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not
     affect the UTC readiness assessment but will be captured for deployment readiness
     tracking.
     3.4.7.4. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
     “rainbow” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements, but
     shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should be
     assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
     deployment. For a “rainbow” UTC, a comment should be entered to indicate the status of
     the shared equipment.
         3.4.7.4.1. (Added-ANG) Resources belonging to another unit will not be counted in
         UTC assessments unless some type of agreement is documented prior to using the
         resources for reporting purposes.
  3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or
  deficient capabilities, e.g. a shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red, but a
  shortage of one generator may. Remarks should reflect training requirements and/or resource
  actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
  3.4.9. In addition and independent of the readiness stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red)
  assessment, each unit will indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can
  meet theater specific requirements including line remarks within deployment timeline.
AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             19


   3.4.10. When skill level and/or grade substitutions, not explicitly allowed in the MISCAP
   but authorized IAW AFI 10-403 guidance, are used in ART reporting, they will be noted
   using the Standard Assessment Remark of Skill Level or Grade, and drive an assessment
   equivalent to the assessment found in guidance within Attachment 4 of this AFI.
   3.4.11. Commanders will continue to accomplish Readiness assessments even if the
   capability is deployed. When conducting such assessments units will presume that the health
   of the ALN has not changed unless circumstances/information warrants otherwise. Whether
   or not an ALN is deployed, has no impact on the readiness assessment. If a UTC is deployed
   and was being assessed as Green, commanders will continue to assess the UTC as Green
   unless circumstances/information warrants otherwise. For UTCs that were deployed while
   being assessed Yellow or Red, commanders will continue with that assessment until
   circumstances/information warrants upgrading the assessment.
       3.4.11.1. (Added-ANG) Deployed Units. Units will continue to report in ART when
       committed to combat operations (i.e. located in a combat zone), when on Temporary
       Duty (TDY) for training, when involved in local training (base exercises, base
       inspections, etc.), or deployed.
       3.4.11.2. (Added-ANG) Unit Activation or Re-activation. Upon posturing of new
       UTCs, it is expected that activating units report downgraded assessments until UTC
       capability can be supported.
       3.4.11.3. (Added-ANG) Unit Inactivation. Inactivating units will continue to assess
       postured UTCs until they are deleted or the fill rate of personnel has decreased to 25% or
       less. UTCs will be deleted upon MAJCOM approval; units must provide a written request
       to NGB/A3XR. Once the unit has been officially inactivated, NGB/A3XR will ensure all
       UTCs are removed from the ART database.
       3.4.11.4. (Added-ANG) Mission Conversion. When a unit is transitioning to another
       mission, the unit will continue to assess its current UTCs until mission change is reflected
       in positions on the UMD and new UTCs are postured.
   3.4.12. Comments regarding ULN and RDD-type information must be applied to the
   “TASKING ASSESSMENT REMARK” not “CC Comments”.
       3.4.12.1. (Added-ANG) Report/information from             deployed     location   indicates
       unavailability/inability of personnel and/or equipment.
3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed
using the category areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment will be rated using
the following guidelines and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist (Attachment 2). Think of
the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1). Additionally, a Yes/No process can be
used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet theater specific requirements
(Figure 3.2).
   3.5.1. Green. The complete UTC to include the exact MANFOR and LOGFOR equipment
   with only MISCAP explicit substitutions, or green skill level, or grade substitutions (see
   Attachment 4). All required deployment training for the UTC can be accomplished within 72
   hours of notification or sooner if subject to more stringent criteria.
20                                             AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013


  3.5.2. Yellow. The UTC has a missing or deficient MANFOR or LOGFOR requirement, but
  that missing or deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and
  accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. This includes AFI 10-403
  approved standard substitutions. Provide a detailed explanation in remarks. Describe the
  condition, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date. In the event that a skill
  level or grade is dependent only on a members’ promotion it still needs to be noted and, if
  not listed in Attachment 4, still drives a “Yellow” Readiness Assessment at a minimum.
  3.5.3. Red. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the entire UTC from
  being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. Provide
  detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective action
  and provide a get-well date.
  3.5.4. Black (Incorrectly postured). UTCs are assessed “incorrectly postured” when the UTC
  is postured against the unit in UTA and the unit commander believes this to be in error based
  on a comparison of authorizations to postured positions. An explanation must be provided in
  the commander’s remarks section to explain why the unit commander believes the UTC was
  postured in error. Assigning this rating in ART will automatically generate an email to the
  MAJCOM ART POC, raising the issue with the MAJCOM FAM to help determine whether
  or not the UTC is correctly postured. A detailed explanation is to be provided in the email of
  why the UTC should not be postured in UTA. For coordination and resolution, this
  information will be forwarded to the MAJCOM FAM responsible for posturing the UTC in
  UTA.
     3.5.4.1. (Added-ANG) Black (Incorrectly Postured). FAM attention is needed. A UTC
     has been postured against a unit in error (e.g. if a CE UTC has been postured against a
     Medical unit). The following examples do not make a UTC(s) incorrectly postured:
     UTC(s) marked for deletion; UTC/UMD mismatch; UTC/UMD overtasking; unit not
     capable of filling an AFSC requirement (read UTC MISCAP for substitution rule);
     AFSCs not specific to a unit; loss of positions or AFSC on UMD; UMD changes; UTC(s)
     in the process of being moved from one Tempo Band to another or from a Tempo Band
     to the Enabler Band; UTCs in the process of being moved within a Wing from one
     squadron to another; questionable AFSC requirements; tasking is more than UMD
     authorized; unit no longer supports specific tasking requirements; unit in the process of a
     conversion; unit no longer tasked with a portion (not all) of equipment or personnel on a
     UTC; double line numbers listed under the UTC in the ART database; UTC not reflected
     in UMIS; AFSC grade or skill level changes within a UTC; Equipment not specific to a
     unit (read UTC MISCAP for suitable replacement rule); questionable P-coded AFSCs;
     old UTCs in the process of being replaced by new UTCs. If a UTC is questionable for
     any reason, the FAM must be contacted to find out the status of the UTC.
     3.5.4.2. (Added-ANG) If a UTC has been erroneously postured against a unit in the
     ART database, the unit will report the UTC Black and provide a detailed explanation of
     the assessment in the remarks section. The unit must contact the UTC FAM for corrective
     action. Included in the remarks will be the name and DSN of unit POC or ART monitor.
  3.5.5. After each refresh, a change report is produced and available through the ‘reports’ tab.
  Change reports are kept within the application for three months. The owning organization is
  responsible for follow-up and review of their unit changes.
AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            21

       the MANFOR and LOGDET exactly and can meet its MISCAP? *
                  * Unless authorized by MISCAP and/or Attachment 4




3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning UTCs
tasked to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet theater-
specific requirements to include line remarks. This assessment is independent of the overall UTC
readiness stoplight assessment. As an example, a UTC may not have a person with specific skill
level and experience required by line remarks, however the UTC status (Green, Yellow, Red)
does not change since the readiness stoplight assessment is based on the UTCs ability to deploy
anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red UTC readiness
stoplight assessment due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater
requirement. Even though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still
Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it
   can meet theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).

3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report
and are used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in
any reportable area. Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary.
Remarks are mandatory for UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be
standardized remarks from Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab) only. The Commander's Remarks section is an additional
avenue that should be utilized to provide vital information that affects the readiness or
availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the readiness status of
the UTC (i.e. Green, Yellow, or Red). For UTCs assessed as Black (Incorrectly Postured), an
explanation must be entered in the CC Remarks Section.
   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and
   amplify data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they
   contain all appropriate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc.
   Remarks should be sufficient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective
   action. The remarks sections are not size limited.
       3.7.1.1. (Added-ANG) A detailed explanation must be provided for clarification of all
       UTCs assessed as Yellow, Red and Black. Explanations must include the specific
       deficiency and corrective action. Career field specific acronyms must be spelled out for
AFI10-244_ANGSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             23


       remark clarification. Explain deficiencies in layman’s terms, addressing planned
       corrective actions and provide a realistic GWD date.
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously
   requested assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required,
   and provide a projection of when the readiness status will change.
       3.7.2.1. (Added-ANG) Remarks must explain the issue clearly and should not reference
       other UTC assessments. See Attachment 3 for examples of remarks.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations as reflected in AFDD 1-2 and/or AFI 10-401 are
   acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or unit/system/functional specific acronyms will
   be defined when first used in a report. Do not refer to previous reports (ART is dynamic and
   will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample,
   review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks.
3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC
assessments at least every 31 calendar days. The Air Force goal for on-time reporting is 97%.
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC, the unit
   commander will submit an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes
   notification of a UTC change or addition.
   3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTCs tasked to deploy will submit via ART an
   assessment of their ability to support the tasking, including theater-specific requirements,
   within five (5) days of receipt of a deployment notification.
   3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to
   "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources in process at their home
   station.
3.9. Where to Report. ART is accessed from the AFPC/DPW homepage located at the
following URL: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil. Click on the “AEF UTC Reporting
Tool” link. Users are required to have SIPRNET access in order to submit ART updates.

                               ART MONITOR ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

         Table A2.1. ART Monitor Assessment Checklist
Units may use this checklist as a tool to assess UTC Personnel, Training, Equipment/       Current AEF
Supplies and Equipment Condition (PTEC) monthly in ART. ALWAYS consider what the
UTC's MISCAP states when assessing.
GREEN = There are absolutely NO UTC deficiencies in any of the four assessed areas         G
YELLOW = UTC can meet MISCAP but there are deficiencies to be noted                             Y
RED = UTC cannot meet MISCAP due to too many deficiencies                                         R
INCORRECTLY POSTURED = UTC is incorrectly postured and requires MAJCOM
FAM attention.
Check the appropriate shaded block (G, Y, R) below, depending on how you answer the question. The
lowest rating in any area will drive the overall rating of the UTC. Any deficiencies must have remarks
and Get Well Dates (GWD); check each month for expiration. Only the FINAL rating is used in ART.
Refer to the MISCAP, MANFOR, LOGFOR, MILPDS, AFI 10-244 (Ch 3), AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.

Once an individual is associated to an AEF, their AEFI will only be changed under extenuating
circumstances. See AFI 10-401, para 14.4.1.
