                                            Chapter 5

                                  TRAFFIC CIRCULATION.

5.1. Locale. RAFL is located in an area of normally light to heavy traffic on the roadways
adjacent to and through the installation. The A1065 runs north-south and borders the east side of
RAFL. Wangford Farm Road (designated a C road) runs east-west and is located north of RAFL
main base. The B1112 runs north-south and is located west of RAFL. Peak traffic hours occur
Monday-Friday, 0700-0830, 1130-1300, and 1600-1730. RAFF is located in an area of normally
light traffic and will not be addressed here.
5.2. Special Features of Traffic. The roadways both on and off the installation present three
definite hazards. First, the roads are constructed for British automobiles and larger US
manufactured vehicles have difficulty maneuvering. Second, British roads are constructed for
right-hand drive vehicles and a large percentage of the vehicles driven by base personnel are left-
hand drive. Third, limited parking on the installation compounds problems with traffic flow
during peak periods.
5.3. Adverse Road And Weather Conditions.
   5.3.1. Adverse road and weather conditions occur in and around RAFL, normally during
   winter months. Preplanning for fog, black ice, and flooding is recommended for all vehicle
   operators.
   5.3.2. RAFL experiences heavy fog conditions from October through January with early
   morning fog as the greatest threat during December and January. The Command Post (CP)
   will announce current fog conditions over the base public address systems.
   5.3.3. During periods when visibility falls below a quarter of a mile, GOVs will not be
   operated off base unless mission-essential and privately owned vehicle operators should
   reduce speed and exercise extreme caution. Only essential vehicles are permitted to operate
   on the flightline and then at a reduced speed commensurate with the conditions. During
   periods when visibility falls below 1/10 mile, only EMERGENCY GOVs will be permitted
   to depart the base or operate on the flightline and privately owned vehicle operators should
   consider postponing their journeys. Flightline vehicle speed limits will be reduced to 5mph
   during limited visibility. The operation of POVs on the flightline will be discouraged by all
   supervisors and prohibited at the discretion of Airfield Management Operations.
   5.3.4. The hazard of sheet ice (black ice) on the roadways is a serious problem occurring
   predominantly between 1900-0900, November through March. Historically, January and
   February are the most hazardous months.. Caution should be utilized by vehicle operators
   when driving off base and vehicles operating on the flightline will be reduced to essential
   vehicles only when conditions for black ice are present.
   5.3.5. Flooding does occasionally occur during heavy rainstorms. When these conditions
   occur, individual actions will be taken to reroute traffic around flooded areas. The following
   areas are known to exhibit drainage problems: intersection of Norwich and Plymouth Roads,
   Richmond and Yarmouth Roads, Bedford Road adjacent to Building 904/Fitness Center,
   Windsor Circle adjacent to quarters 528, Building 998/BX parking lot, and Bangor Road
   adjacent to Building 250/Lakenheath Youth Programs.

  5.3.6. Road Conditions: (See Attachment 4)
     5.3.6.1. When weather conditions dictate a change in driving conditions and/or school
     delays/closures, the CP will make the appropriate notifications (paragraph 5.4.6.5.). In
     the event of road conditions red or black, the CP will initiate an information only recall.
     Commanders and directors can direct a recall or direct delayed reporting at their
     discretion based on mission needs, therefore reporting instructions will vary depending
     on unit, job, and place of residence.
        5.3.6.1.1. To find out the current driving condition and to check the status of DoDD
        school delays/closures, visit the Lakenheath webpage at http://www.lakenheath.af.mil
        or the Lakenheath Facebook or Twitter pages. Alternately, personnel can call the
        weather line at DSN 226-3541 (or commercial 01638-523541). The information will
        also be broadcast on local radio stations.
     5.3.6.2. Weather Condition Change Process. The following outlines the process for
     changing weather conditions.
        5.3.6.2.1. The on-duty SF Flight Chief or designated representative will ensure:
        5.3.6.2.2. Contact is made with base weather to ascertain weather report and
        condition.
        5.3.6.2.3. Morning Weather Sweeps. SF patrols will check high volume morning
        traffic routes, see Attachment 5, on base for severe road or weather conditions and
        report information to the BDOC no later than (NLT) 0300 daily. The BDOC will
        crosscheck with RAF Mildenhall BDOC and local civilian police to ascertain road
        conditions for Suffolk County.
        5.3.6.2.4. Whenever weather and road conditions make driving hazardous and
        increase the likelihood of accidents (i.e., excessive fog, snow, ice), the on-duty Flight
        Sergeant or designated representative (BDOC) will contact the DFC (48 SFS/CC) to
        recommend a weather condition change.
        5.3.6.2.5. A SF patrol will continue to verify road conditions throughout the day and
        ensure updates are immediately relayed if the weather continues to deteriorate.
     5.3.6.3. The DFC or designated representative will recommend road condition changes
     to the MSG/CC or designated representative.
     5.3.6.4. The MSG/CC or designated representative will then contact the CP with the
     appropriate road/weather condition and determine appropriate delayed reporting of
     Mission Essential Services Only (MESO).
     5.3.6.5. The CP will update the Weather Line information, send out an AtHoc message,
     and contact the following agencies when notified of a change in road/weather condition,
     MESO status, or school/bus delay/closure:
        5.3.6.5.1. 48 SFS/BDOC to confirm the official change in road/weather condition.
        SFS will make a blotter entry, change road condition sign at installation entry points,
        and brief personnel at entry points on driving conditions/speed limitations.
        5.3.6.5.2. 48 FW/PA to update the Lakenheath intranet web page, update the public
        access webpage and the Commander’s Access Channel slides. PA will send out base-
LAKENHEATHI31-102 24 APRIL 2014                                                                35


           wide e-mail informing the base populace of the change in road/weather condition and
           any other pertinent safety information.
   5.3.7. Squadron commanders will individually make determination on selective recalls and
   notifications within their units.
   5.3.8. All MESO delays or cancellations still require Essential Service Personnel (ESP) to
   report for severe weather operations as determined by squadron commanders, and are
   instructed to proceed with care and caution.
5.4. Special Event Contingencies. The planning, supervision and direction of traffic control
procedures required for events such as open houses, football games, bazaars, air shows, and base
carnivals will be the responsibility of the Security Forces Police Services section (48 SFS/S3OP).
Any agency or organization planning/hosting such an event must coordinate with 48 SFS/S3OP
at least 30 days prior to the event date. 48 SFS/S3OP will ensure 48 FW/SE reviews all traffic
control plans before implementation.
5.5. Traffic Signs. When possible, traffic control signs and devices will be in compliance with
British standards. Those where there are no equivalent British sign or device will be based on
the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MOUTCD). The Wing Safety office will be
responsible for monitoring traffic control devices used on the installation. The Base Civil
Engineer is responsible for the construction, procurement, placement and maintenance of the
required control devices based on work orders submitted by Safety.
5.6. Military Formations. You may not pass a marching/running formation until signaled by
the person controlling the formation. The speed limit while passing formation is no faster than
5mph. Personnel conducting physical fitness training are present everywhere on base. You are
required to yield to runners on all roadways, intersections, and crosswalks. Road guards or
safety spotters will be utilized to safely control traffic.
5.7. Off-Base Driving Restrictions. It is prohibited to pass any vehicle traveling on the
following roads: the Al101 (between Bury St. Edmunds and Littleport); the A1065 (between
Brandon and the five-ways roundabout); the C602 (also known as “Holywell Row,” connecting
A1101 and B1112); the B1112 (between Methwold Hythe and Icklingham); the B1107 (between
Brandon and Thetford); Wangford Road (between A1065 and B1112) and “Sedge Fen Road”
(connecting A1101 and B1112). Exception: Slow-moving vehicles. A slow-moving vehicle is
defined as any vehicle traveling less than 30 mph. When passing slow-moving vehicles, drivers
have the responsibility to do so only where passing is safe and authorized by UK traffic laws.
Any driver who violates the no-passing policy will face appropriate action under this instruction,
Article 92 of the UCMJ, or other lawful authority. This may include revocation of 3AF Form
435.
5.8. Off-Base Motorcycle Riding Restrictions.
   5.8.1. Filtering is defined as passing between lanes of stopped or slow moving vehicles
   while operating a motorcycle. Lane splitting is defined as passing between lanes of free-
   flowing traffic travelling at normal speeds while operating a motorcycle.
   5.8.2. Filtering is permitted when traffic is stopped or moving at slow speeds, defined as 20
   mph or less. Riders will filter at speeds no more than 10 mph faster than the surrounding
   traffic.

  5.8.3. Lane splitting when traffic is moving faster than 20 mph is prohibited. Normal
  overtaking methods should be used.
  5.8.4. All overtaking, including filtering, must follow UK Highway Code rules. Overtaking
  is not permitted where there is a “No Overtaking” sign, or if you have to cross over a solid
  white line to do so, on the hard shoulders of motorways, or past the lead vehicle on the
  approach to a crossing with zigzag white lines.
LAKENHEATHI31-102 24 APRIL 2014                                                                     37


                                             Chapter 6

  ARMED FORCES TRAFFIC TICKET PROCESSING, DISPOSITION AND APPEAL
                          PROCEDURES.

6.1. Ticket Processing. This paragraph describes requirements for unit commanders, first
sergeants or designated officials to follow when processing traffic tickets issued to individuals or
their units for violations listed in AFMAN 31-116 and AFI 31-218(I) and its USAFE
Supplement, and Attachment 2 of this instruction. It also describes disposition and appeal
procedures.
   6.1.1. DD Form 1408 Issuing Procedures. When issuing a DD Form 1408, patrolmen will
   write, stamp or place a label on the back of the pink copy given to the violator with the
   following: ―If you wish to rebut this citation report to 48 SFS Reports and Analysis
   (SFAR/S5R), Bldg #1092, within 5 duty days. If you do not notify 48 SFS Reports and
   Analysis of rebuttal request, it is assumed you do not wish to rebut the citation. Please notify
   your Commander or First Sergeant within 24 hours or next duty day.
   6.1.2. If issuing a citation for a fix-it-ticket each violation must be written on a separate DD
   Form 1408.
6.2. Security Forces Processing and Disposition of DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic
Ticket.
   6.2.1. If the violator does not notify 48 SFS Reports and Analysis within five duty days of
   request to rebut the citation, 48 SFS Reports and Analysis will complete the administrative
   process by writing on the back of the white copy “Did not rebut” and endorse the infractions
   on the DD Form 1408. However, 48 SFS Reports and Analysis must still notify the violator’s
   first sergeant and commander of the violation. If the violator is assigned to another
   installation, forward the citation to the assigned installation for action. It is the responsibility
   of the installation which the member is assigned to input the citation and complete the
   administrative action in SFMIS.
       6.2.1.1. Notification to the violator’s first sergeant and commander can be accomplished
       either via e-mail, base information transfer system (BITS) or official mail; however, the
       process must be standardized and provide accountability.
       6.2.1.2. If the violator does not wish to rebut the violation, Reports and Analysis inputs
       the citation into SFMIS; the Reports and Analysis clerk will then check the appropriate
       response on the back of the citation and the violator requires no further action. Note: If
       through accumulation of points or offense the violator has met the requirement to
       revoke/suspended their driving privileges notify the 48 MSG/CC or designee for approval
       to revoke/suspend the violators driving privileges, then advise the violator’s first
       sergeant/commander (for military members) they need to escort the member to 48 SFS
       Reports and Analysis for issuance of revocation/suspension letter. If unable to contact
       the violator of the revocation/suspension, it will be sent via certified mail.
   6.2.2. If an individual is cited for a serious/apprehendable offense such as drag racing on the
   installation, driving while under revocation, speeding over double the speed limit, the DD
   Form 1408 will be processed through 48 SFS Reports and Analysis as outline in Incident
 38                                                  LAKENHEATHI31-102 24 APRIL 2014


   Report Procedures. The nature of these incidents may generate a report. If so, process the
   report and ticket together.
   6.2.3. When there is not enough information to locate the subject/owner of the vehicle, the
   ticket will be given back to the SF member to be voided. Prior to voiding the ticket, the
   issuing officer will make every effort and attempt to determine ownership of the vehicle. If
   the ticket has administrative errors, it will be returned to 48 S3/S3OP for correction. If the
   ticket needs to be voided, the issuing SF member or DFC may do so. No other person has
   the authority to void the ticket. This ensures the integrity of the ticket issuing process.
6.3. Security Forces Processing DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, rebuttals.
   6.3.1. If a member wishes to rebut a citation, log the DD Form 1408 into a local suspense
   tracking system and SFMIS.
      6.3.1.1. If the violator requests to rebut the citation, Reports and Analysis clerk will
      obtain the answers to the following questions to give to the rebuttal authority:
          6.3.1.1.1. Is the citation a suspendable offense?
          6.3.1.1.2. Does the offender wish to make a personal appearance or a written
          rebuttal?
      6.3.1.2. If the offender wishes to rebut the citation, then the unit commander or section
      commander will be forwarded the citation and all evidence for further action.
          6.3.1.2.1. 48 SFS Reports and Analysis personnel will give the violator instructions
          on how to rebut the citation.
          6.3.1.2.2. Provide a template for a written rebuttal. Inform the violator that their
          Commander must endorse DD Form 1408 for infractions the violator wishes to rebut.
   6.3.2. Place the yellow copy of the DD Form 1408 in the suspense file pending disposition.
   Set a 14-day suspense for command action.
   6.3.3. Complete blocks 19-23 on the back of the white copy and annotate any prior history,
   points assessed, and the suspense date. In the “Report of Action Taken on Traffic Violation”,
   black out the words “No Action Taken”; this is not an option. If applicable, attach the
   driving history for the violator from SFMIS. Forward the white copy to the violator‘s
   commander for action. If a DD Form 1408 was issued during the course of an accident
   investigation, attach a copy of the accident report to the ticket when it is sent for command
   action.
   6.3.4. If response on command action is not received by the due date, forward a
   memorandum, which can be electronic, “Notice of Late Suspense,” giving an additional 7-
   day suspense. If the additional suspense is not met, send a “Notice of Second Late
   Suspense,” memorandum to the unit commander with a courtesy copy to the group
   commander. Suspense extensions will be granted by DFC on case-by-case basis. Notices of
   Late Suspense can be completed electronically as long as 48 SFS Reports and Analysis
   maintains a copy of the read receipt.
   6.3.5. Once finalized, record command action and enter it into the SFMIS case database.
   File the original DD Form 1408 as required by AFI 33-364, Records Disposition Procedures
   and Responsibilities.
LAKENHEATHI31-102 24 APRIL 2014                                                             39


  6.3.6. Procedures for Rebutting the DD Form 1408.
     6.3.6.1. The violator must submit a rebuttal letter, provided by 48 SFS/S5AR,
     articulating his/her position to the DFC through 48 SFS/S5AR within 14-days of receipt
     of the ticket. The letter must be endorsed by his/her commander. The purpose of this
     endorsement is to ensure command-level involvement.
     6.3.6.2. 48 SFS Reports and Analysis will obtain a written statement from the Security
     Forces patrolman who issued the ticket for inclusion in the rebuttal package. The
     completed package will be forwarded to the DFC for his/her annotation/recommendation.
     If the DFC concurs with the rebuttal they will direct Reports and Analysis on what
     actions to take. If the DFC non-concurs the completed package will be forwarded to the
     rebuttal authority (wing commander or designee) for final decision. Once the rebuttal
     authority has made a decision, 48 SFS Reports and Analysis will notify the violator of the
     final outcome of his/her ticket rebuttal in writing.

                              SAMPLE E-MAIL DUI REPORT

Figure A3.1. Sample E-mail DUI Report
To: 48 FW/CC
From: Unit
Subject: “Name of Sq” DUI After Action Report “Date of Offense”
THE FACTS:
On “DATE OF INCIDENT”, a “AGE AND RANK OF OFFENDER” from the 48 FW decided
to go to “LOCATION OF INCIDENT” with the intention of drinking at two local clubs. He
began his evening by dropping his car off at a friend’s house (who was TDY) in Newmarket and
taking a cab to the “WHERE DRINKING OCCURRED” around 2000. He consumed
approximately five pints of beer and met some British acquaintances at the pub, but otherwise
was alone for the evening. At approximately 2300, he walked to “XXXX” and had one last pint
around midnight. He then proceeded by cab back to his friend’s house, and began to drive back
to his residence shortly before 0200.

Shortly after he began the trip to his house, the local constabulary pulled him over at 0155 for
erratic driving. They asked if he would consent to a breathalyzer which he did. The result was a
98 microgram reading (roughly 3 times the legal limit, 0.22 U.S. equivalent) and a trip to the
constabulary station where he was held until 0800 when he was formally charged.

Additionally, this is the individual’s second DUI; the first was at Altus AFB, OK in 2000.

THE PLAN:
This individual had a solid plan when he began his evening. He thought ahead and parked his
car at his friend’s house, took a taxi where needed and returned to his friend’s house where he
planned to spend the night. He had planned to stay with friends that evening.

PLAN EXECUTION:
The individual explained that his plan was executed well until he reached his friend’s house. For
reasons he could not explain, when he exited the cab at his friend’s house, he simply got into his
car and began his journey home. Following a rights advisement, he was asked why he got in his
car in violation of his own plan, he answered, “I don’t know.” When queried on other means to
get home safely in this situation, he stated that he was familiar with many other programs
(AADD, taxi chit, co-worker…) and he would not be reluctant to call his supervisor. It didn’t
occur to him to use these means to safely remove himself from this situation.

LESSONS IDENTIFIED:
Alcohol diminishes the ability for rational thought! If the “RANK” would have stuck to his plan,
he would not have received a DUI; however, he was not capable of making the smart decision.
Also, this person was out on his own with no wingman for cover. His Wingman was on leave-he
claims that he would have called him if available.
LAKENHEATHI31-102 24 APRIL 2014                                                               57


PREVENTION:
Take away the ability to deviate from your plan. Had the individual taken a cab from his home
to the club, the source of this conflict would not have been available-he wouldn’t have had the
means to get behind the wheel and he would not have been compelled to jump into his car and
endanger himself and others. Also, have a back-up wingman. Being out alone doesn’t show
good judgment and it’s much easier to talk yourself into a poor decision. Have a solid buddy
system and use it!
