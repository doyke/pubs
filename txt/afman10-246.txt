                                            Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview of FW Protection. The actions outlined in this publication reflect the minimum
requirements to promote FW protection for each stage of the food and drinking water production
process. These actions will prevent or mitigate intentional introduction of contaminants into the
food or water supply at an installation.
1.1.1. Vision:To safeguard FW assets through application of Risk Management (RM) by
incorporating deliberate planning and developing enhanced security measures. Reference AFI
31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), for guidance on Integrated Defense Risk Management.

     1.1.2. Threat: Multiple sources (e.g., international terrorist groups, hate groups, cults) can
     attack USAF FW supplies with low cost and easily acquired materials. Individuals and
     organizations responsible for FW protection must be aware of the potential for covert and
     overt attacks on FW supplies. Water supplies are critical for response to and recovery from
     terrorist incidents not directly involving the water system. For more detailed, location-
     specific information, consult the Threat Information Fusion Cell (TIFC) for location specific
     threat information or base level intelligence organizations. Note: The Air Force Office of
     Special Investigations (AFOSI) is part of the TIFC.
     1.1.3. Strategy: Vulnerabilities can be prevented or reduced, and the impact of an actual
     attack can be mitigated using the AT RM process (Reference Standard 3 in AFI 10-245).
     This publication applies RM principles to assist military forces in planning and implementing
     force protection measures to prevent or mitigate potential FW attacks in garrison and
     deployed locations. FW protection and survivability must be ensured during contingency
     operations and at fixed permanent AF installations.
1.2. All installation organizations and personnel: have a responsibility to apply the following
components of FW protection.
     1.2.1. Identify all FW assets, including any source(s) or procurement systems approved for
     use by AF personnel, including the steps from origination to consumption.
     1.2.2. Apply RM IAW AFI 31-101, Chapter 3to FW protection. Identify hazards at each
     step of the FW distribution systems. Assess and manage the risk for effective FW protection.
     The goal is optimal security in a cost effective manner (not complete security at any cost).
     Complete security will rarely be feasible; however, proper implementation of the RM process
     can reduce risk to an acceptable level.
     1.2.3. Eliminate Opportunity for Entry.
        1.2.3.1. Deterrence of unwanted entry relies on not only physical barriers, but also
        circulation control measures for detection (electronic sensors, etc.) and interception of
        unauthorized persons.
        1.2.3.2. Limit access to those areas necessary for the employee's position (e.g., card entry
        to sensitive areas, cypher locks). Reference AFI 31-101 for guidance.
AFMAN10-246 27 MAY 2014                                                                        5


  1.2.4. Eliminate Potential for Insider Threats. This strategy relies on the use of restricted
  entry to certain areas, owner-user security procedures, and/or detection systems.
     1.2.4.1. Identification. All personnel will have an approved form of identification
     readily available (i.e., government issued identification or identification acceptable to
     obtain installation access). Reference or use identification standards from AFI 31-113,
     Installation Perimeter Access Control (FOUO). (T-1).
         1.2.4.1.1. Contractors will obtain a visitors badge and comply with escort/non-escort
         policy of the facility. (T-1).
         1.2.4.1.2. Non-facility personnel will utilize sign-in and sign-out logs. (T-1).
     1.2.4.2. Personal items. Limit personal items allowed in establishment.
         1.2.4.2.1. Prohibit lunch containers, purses, gym bags, thermoses, drink containers,
         etc., in food handling areas.
         1.2.4.2.2. Provide locker areas for all employees. Establish authority (during hiring
         process, etc.) and have policy to enter lockers and inspect storage devices/containers
         for periodic safety and security reviews. Metal mesh lockers provide additional
         security because contents are visible.
  1.2.5. Establish General Security Procedures for Food/Water Suppliers.               Local
  managers/operators should, and installation personnel must, establish proportional security
  procedures commensurate with threat levels (both local Force Protection Conditions
  (FPCON) and National levels). (T-1).
     1.2.5.1. All vendors will be scrutinized during the annual FW vulnerability assessments.
     (T-1). Requiring activity (e.g., Force Support Squadron, Defense Commissary Agency,
     Army & Air Force Exchange) should work with Contracting on mitigating any identified
     vulnerabilities.
     1.2.5.2. Food/Bottled Water Processing. Work with supplier/vendor to improve onsite
     security programs, such as limiting entry and exit, implementing sign-in and sign-out
     logs, securing bulk storage containers, motion detection/notification sensors, and
     mounting video surveillance cameras at key internal processing hubs (state, local, and/or
     Host Nation laws may apply).
  1.2.6. Security Procedures and Probationary Periods for Hiring.              FW vulnerability
  assessment teams should work closely with AFOSI and Security Forces (SF) to gather
  Human Intelligence data in their Area of Responsibility (AOR). Enhanced situational
  awareness of the local population will result in a better understanding and selection of people
  hired locally.
     1.2.6.1. Obtain work references and investigate prospective hires.
     1.2.6.2. Perform criminal background checks on all personnel.
     1.2.6.3. Place new employees on shifts with oversight during the probationary period.
     During the hiring process, obtain authorization to conduct random drug testing.
  1.2.7. Food protection includes measures to prevent both unintentional/accidental
  contamination (food safety) and intentional/deliberate contamination (food defense).
6                                                                AFMAN10-246 27 MAY 2014


    Integration of food safety procedures IAW AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program, will be used
    to mitigate unintentional contamination. (T-1).
    1.2.8. Owner-User will patrol all water access points (to include off-base water access points
    in the U.S.) and report all suspicious activity immediately to SF. (T-1).
AFMAN10-246 27 MAY 2014                                                                      7

   3.2.1. IAW AF Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-219 Vol 1, Contingency and Disaster Planning,
   Attachment 2:
       3.2.1.1. Establish execution checklists in "grab and go" binders for the response team
       and control center position and include all relevant items. (T-2).
       3.2.1.2. Ensure adequate resources are available to store and distribute potable water in a
       contingency situation.           This may include water storage containers
       (bladders/buffaloes/etc.), water distribution trucks, or bottled water supplies. Consider
       reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPUs) if requirements dictate. (T-2).
       3.2.1.3. BCE in consultation with BE will devise a Water Demand Reduction Plan to be
       maintained in an appropriate annex of the BCE CRP (e.g., Annex N) to address
       emergencies or other situations where restricted water use may be necessary. (T-0).
   3.2.2. BE will ensure adequate quantities of serviceable bacteriological and chemical water
   test kits are available to conduct monitoring during contingency operations. BE will develop
   a list of parameters to monitor for basic water quality that will account for local threat
   scenarios. Expired kits may be used for training. (T-1).
   3.2.3. BCE will establish, in conjunction with SFS, written procedures for increased
   safeguarding of the drinking water system during elevated FPCON, e.g., increased
   surveillance and monitoring, and incorporate into the base BCE CRP. (T-2).

Terms
Food Protection—─Overarching term that includes measures to prevent both
intentional/deliberate contamination (food defense) and unintentional/accidental contamination
(food safety).
Food and Water Risk Assessment─Performed only in OCONUS locations and assesses the
food protection risk of caterers, restaurants, forward operating bases local national food facilities;
host nation dining facilities (at the request of the installation or senior mission Commander); and
other feeding locations supporting military exercises, meetings, conferences, and events.
FWRAs are applicable for short—term (i.e., one-event only or early entry) use, and are valid
through the end of the exercise, meeting, etc. For recurring use facilities, FWRAs are valid for
not more than 6 months. They are not a substitute for a Veterinary Food Protection Audit.
Public Health Officers and PH Senior Noncommissioned Officers will be authorized to perform
upon (1) completion of Service level agreements with DODVSA and (2) completion of required
training.
Food and Water Vulnerability Assessment─—A process to identify, mitigate, and minimize
vulnerabilities that increase opportunities for deliberate/intentional contamination of the food
supply chain or that can lead to water degradation and/or supply disruptions.
Force Protection (FP)─Preventive measures taken to mitigate hostile actions against DoD
personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information (JP
1—02). [As defined by the AF, FP is the process of detecting threats and hazards to the AF and
its mission, and applying measures to deter, preempt, negate, or mitigate them based on an
acceptable level of risk. (AFDD 3-10).]
Requiring Activity─A military or other designated supported organization that identifies and
receives contracted support during military operations. Identifies a specific requirement and
 24                                                           AFMAN10-246 27 MAY 2014


defines the requirement. Responsible for developing a performance work statement. (JP 4—
10).
Risk Management─The process of identifying critical assets; understanding the threat;
understanding AF vulnerabilities to the threat; determining risk to personnel, assets, and
information; and assuming risk or applying countermeasures to correct or mitigate the risk
(AFDD 3—10). Water and food production processes involve inherent risk. All members of the
vulnerability assessment team are responsible for identifying/prioritizing potential risks and
offering control solutions.
