This instruction implements the 401st Air Expeditionary Wing (401 AEW) Commander's Coin Recogni-
tion Program. This instruction establishes guidelines for additional unit programs in conjunction with AFI
36-2805. The coins used in this award program must be purchased with appropriated funds in accordance
with AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, AFI 36-2853, Unit Plaque Awards, and this
instruction.
This instruction applies to all organizations assigned to the 401 AEW. Maintain and dispose of records
created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition
Schedule (will become AFMAN 33-322, Volume 4). Comply with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act
Program, for documents containing Privacy Act information. Comply with DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air
Force Supplement/ AFSPCSUP1, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, Chapter 4, for documents
containing For Official Use Only information.


1. Purpose. The purpose of the 401 AEW Commander's Coin Recognition Program is to provide com-
manders an informal means to recognize individuals for a one-time, non-recurring contribution of supe-
rior performance or personal effort to mission accomplishment. There are two levels of recognition: wing
and unit level.

2. Program Responsibilities.
   2.1. Wing Program.
       2.1.1. The Wing Commander (401 AEW/CC) will approve all individuals to receive a wing rec-
       ognition coin, and personally present the coin(s).
       2.1.2. The Wing Executive Officer (401 AEW/CCE) will maintain control of the supply of wing
       recognition coins.
       2.1.3. Downrange units will be provided a small number of wing recognition coins to be selec-
       tively awarded by the deployed unit commander as recognition in lieu of the 401 AEW/CC, if the
2                                                                401AEWI36-2805 23 AUGUST 2004


       401 AEW/CC can not personally present the coin in a timely manner. To preserve the value of this
       coin, unit commanders should limit presenting these coins to only their top 10% of AEF personnel
       deployed.
    2.2. Unit Program. Unit Commanders (Unit/CCs) may establish a unit-level commander's coin recog-
    nition program under the provisions identified in this instruction. Unit/CCs who establish a coin rec-
    ognition program will:
       2.2.1. Approve all individuals to receive the unit-level recognition coin.
       2.2.2. Designate, in writing, the unit's program administrator who is responsible for maintaining
       control of the supply of group recognition coins.

3. Eligible Recipients. Any military member or appropriated fund employee assigned to 401 AEW or its
subordinate units. Commanders may approve on a limited basis the award of a recognition coin to an indi-
vidual assigned outside their unit/installation providing they meet the criteria in paragraph 1. and have
made a significant contribution to the mission of their unit.

4. Criteria. The criteria to receive a wing recognition coin are broad; however, commanders should limit
their award to those who have gone above and beyond the normal call of duty. This program is established
to recognize superior performance and recognition coins cannot, under any circumstances, be used as
mementos.

5. Privately Funded Coins.
    5.1. Coins purchased with personal or private funds do not fall under the limitations of this instruc-
    tion.
