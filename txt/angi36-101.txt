   2.8.1. The Secretary of the Air Force shall determine those periods of active duty designated
   as a critical mission or critical requirement that could be exempt from the five-year
   cumulative service limit. This authority shall not be used to grant exemptions to avoid the
   cumulative five-year service limit established by law or to extend Airmen on repeated AGR
   tours.

       authority for those orders.
   2.8.2. Military technicians who separate from technician employment to enter into the AGR
   program or to accept an ANG Title 10 Statutory Tour have restoration rights IAW TPR300
   (353), Federal Personnel Manual. Individuals will not be restored to military technician
   status solely to gain entitlement to a new period of restoration rights or to establish a new
   high 3 years of income for federal civil service retirement computation. Exceptions to this
   policy will not be considered. NGB/A1M will not allocate additional resources to
   accommodate restoration to technician status.
       2.8.2.1. Job announcements must indicate that this position is temporary indefinite until
       such time as the departing individual is either restored or the restoration period expires.

   enter an ANG Title 10 Statutory Tour, assigned to the NGB UMD (e.g. Title 10 U.S.C.,
   Sections 10211, 10305, 12402 and 12310) have restoration rights not to exceed five years, to
   the State from which they entered their initial Statutory Tour. Individuals will not be
   restored to AGR status solely to gain entitlement to a new period of restoration rights.
   Exceptions to this policy will not be considered. Each AGR Airman who enters an ANG
   Title 10 Statutory Tour must be informed in writing and acknowledge such notice that the
   individual is entitled to revert to the same military grade held prior to the Statutory Tour
   assignment. Personnel promoted while on Statutory Tour may be placed into the Priority
   Placement Program (PPP) as outlined in Chapter 10 if a full-time UMD position is not
   available to support their current military grade. When the Airman in question is serving in a
   controlled grade, the State must accommodate the Airman within their current controlled
   grade allocations. NGB/A1 will not allocate additional controlled grades to accommodate
   the Airmen return to State control nor allocate additional resources to accommodate
   restoration to AGR status. .
       2.8.3.1. When filling positions vacated by AGR personnel entering a Title 10 ANG
       Statutory Tour, job announcements must indicate that this position is temporary indefinite
       until such time as the departing individual is either restored or the restoration period
       expires.

  years Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS). Restoration rights do not
  automatically apply to these Airmen.

   6.5.1. The following procedures apply to permanent change of station (PCS) assignments:
       6.5.1.1. The gaining State will publish the AGR order with the concurrence of the losing
       State's TAG. The order is contingent upon the conditional release of the individual and
       subsequent enlistment or appointment in the gaining State.
       6.5.1.2. The AGR assignment order will include the number of days required for the
       Airman to travel to the gaining State. The Airman must travel inside the tour start and
       stop dates.
       6.5.1.3. The same procedures apply for PCS moves between units in the same State.
6.6. Assignment to Position/Unit. AGR Airmen are responsible for assisting in the
organization, administration, recruitment, instruction or training of ANG personnel and primarily
assigned against mobility positions. The TAG may approve AGR assignments to the State
Headquarters, HRO, or Joint Force Headquarters provided a validated full-time manpower
requirement exists on the UMD.
   6.6.1. Airmen should remain in the position to which initially assigned for a minimum of 24
   months. TAG may waive this requirement when in the best interest of the unit, State, or Air
   National Guard. .
   6.6.2. ANG AGR Airmen must be assigned against a funded vacant AGR position on their
   Unit Manpower Document (UMD) as extracted from the Manpower Programming and
   Execution System (MPES). AGR Officers are only assigned to funded military positions
   identified with a Resource Identifier Code (RIC) ―0034‖ (AGR Officer). Enlisted AGRs are
   only assigned to funded military positions with a RIC ―0148‖ (AGR Enlisted) on the UMD.
       6.6.2.1. AGR Airmen must be assigned as the sole occupant of their AGR position (not
       double- billeted) IAW ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within the Air National Guard.
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                      25


       6.6.2.2. AGRs cannot be assigned to positions identified on the UMD with the following
       RICs: ―0028‖ (Drill Officer), ―0036‖ (Student Officer), ―0127‖ (Student Enlisted),
       ―0128‖ (Drill Enlisted), ―0160‖ (T5 Civilian), ―0170‖ (Technician), or ―8888‖ (Contract
       Manpower Equivalent).
       6.6.2.3. If a full-time position on the UMD is identified with a RIC ―0170‖ and the unit
       wants to execute it as an AGR, the unit must change the position on the UMD via the
       published Manpower Change Request (MCR) process to either RIC ―0034‖ or ―0148‖
       before assigning a person in AGR status to the position.
6.7. Voluntary Reassignment. Reassignment to an AGR position requires the new position to
have a grade no lower than the individual's current military grade (unless the enlisted Airman
agrees in writing to a reduction in grade IAW ANGI 36-2503, Administrative Demotion of
Airmen). The reassignment must not lead to an overgrade, excess, or a promotion beyond the
highest AGR grade identified for the current position when advertised and hired (Reference
paragraph 13.6 and Table 13.1).
   6.7.1. An amendment to the Airman's AGR order reflecting the new UMD position must be
   accomplished.
   6.7.2. AGR personnel affected by UMD reductions will be given first priority for
   reassignment to any available vacant AGR position within the State for which they are or can
   become qualified (reference Chapter 10).
   6.7.3. New hires may only be authorized after AGR Airmen affected by the UMD reductions
   have been placed (reference Chapter 10).
   6.7.4. Airmen who are reassigned to a new position should remain in that position for a
   minimum of 24 months. TAG may approve waivers when in the best interest of the unit,
   State, and Air National Guard.
6.8. Management Directed Reassignment (MDR) (Involuntary). Commanders will leverage
the MDR program to effectively integrate personnel force development goals, operational
requirements, and career management objectives that sustain and support unit/wing/State
requirements.
   6.8.1. With HRO concurrence, commanders may elect a lateral Management Directed
   Reassignment of an AGR Airman without advertising the position and without the Airman's
   consent. Individual must be fully qualified for the military position. MDRs will not create
   an overgrade or excess assignment nor lead to a promotion beyond the highest military grade
   identified for the current position when advertised and hired. Exceptions are permitted for
   officers who have been selected by a promotion board and have not yet pinned and are
   currently occupying a higher graded position.
   6.8.2. AGRs should serve at least 24 months in their present position to be considered for a
   MDR. MDRs with less than 24 months in current assignment require waiver approval by
   TAG.
   6.8.3. AGRs Airmen who decline a MDR will be released from the AGR program no earlier
   than 120 days after the date they decline. Airmen who desire to be released earlier than 120
   days must make a written request through their chain of command to HRO.
 26                                                               ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


6.9. Key Staff Assignments. A key staff position is a dual status, managerial position which
the incumbent is an Airman of the immediate staff of the State Adjutant General or who serves
under direct supervision of the State Adjutant General. The TAG has the authority to non-
competitively appoint military technicians, AGR Airmen, and traditional Guard Airmen in order
to accommodate either an ―overarching military consideration‖ or a military assignment at the
key staff level. Key staff positions are identified by NGB-J1-TN.
6.10. Details. Details are one time, short term assignments designed to meet an emergent need.
AGR Airmen detailed outside their AFSC will not be detailed for more than 120 days within a
four year period. Consecutive or ―back to back‖ details are prohibited. All details must be
coordinated with and monitored by the State Human Resources Office (HRO) AGR Manager.
6.11. Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and Defense Joint Military Pay System
(DJMS). Permanent, occasional and AGR deployment backfill tours will be entered into
MilPDS IAW Attachment 4. Permanent AGRs will be paid through the Defense Joint Military
Pay System – Active Component (DMJS-AC) and occasional/AGR deployment backfill tours
will be paid through the Defense Joint Military Pay System - Reserve Component (DJMS-RC).
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                           27

                       FORCE MANAGEMENT AND UTLIZATION

7.1. Promotions. While serving in AGR status, existing ANG promotion policies in ANGI 36-
2504, Federal Recognition of Promotion in the Air National Guard of the United States and as a
Reserve of the Air Force Below the Grade of General Officer and ANGI 36-2502, Promotion of
Airmen, will apply to both officers and enlisted personnel, respectively. The grades of Senior
Master Sergeant, Chief Master Sergeant, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel are
congressionally controlled IAW Title 10 U.S.C. Sections 12011 and 12012. Promotion to these
controlled grades cannot exceed the annually established military duty end-strength or grade
ceilings, or the individual controlled grade allocation provided to each respective State (reference
Chapter 13 of this instruction). Therefore, the following controls are necessary.
   7.1.1. Officer and enlisted AGR personnel selected for promotion must be the sole occupant
   of a higher-grade UMD full-time funded AGR (RIC ―0034‖ or ―0148‖) position prior to
   assuming the new grade. Promotion opportunity is limited to the authorized grade on the
   incumbent’s current AGR position as reflected on the UMD. By law, officers not occupying
   a higher-grade position, or constrained by controlled grade limitation may not assume the
   new grade.
       7.1.1.1. Example: A major cannot be position vacancy promoted to lieutenant colonel if
       the authorized grade on their UMD AGR position is major. To advance/further
       promotion opportunity, the individual must find a different AGR job with greater
       responsibility and higher authorized military grade.
       7.1.1.2. Example: A major can be position vacancy promoted to lieutenant colonel if the
       authorized grade on their UMD AGR position is lieutenant colonel or higher.
   7.1.2. Officers selected for promotion under Reserve Officer Promotion Management Act
   (ROPMA) can only be promoted within the State’s controlled grade ceilings. The
   availability of a controlled grade and an assignment in a funded AGR (RIC ―0034‖ or
   ―0148‖) UMD position will be determining factors. Promotions will be involuntarily
   delayed, indefinitely, if a controlled grade is not available. Reference AFI 36-2504, Officer
   Promotion, Continuation and Selective Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air Force for
   additional guidance.
       7.1.2.1. The promotion is considered involuntarily delayed due to controlled grade
       limitations IAW Title 10 U.S.C. Section 14311. When the controlled grade becomes
       available, the officer may assume the higher grade.
   7.1.3. Colonel (O-6) Controlled Grades are centrally managed by NGB/A1M.
       7.1.3.1. All AGR colonel promotion nominations will be coordinated through the State
       HRO/AGR Manager and MPMO, to NGB/A1P.
       7.1.3.2. All AGR colonel promotion nominations will be submitted as a Certificate of
       Eligibility (COE).
 28                                                                ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


   7.1.4. Enlisted AGRs must be fully qualified and may not be promoted above the grade of
   their UMD position. Exception: AGRs promoted under the Deserving Airman Promotion
   Program (DAPP) must meet the criteria outlined in ANGI 36-2502, Promotion of Airmen.
7.2. Reenlistments/Extensions. Enlisted AGRs who are granted continuation as a result of the
ACB or are extended on their AGR tour are authorized to reenlist or extend to support the
retainability requirement regardless of their current ETS.
7.3. Air Force Fitness Program. AGR Airmen are subject to the provisions of ANGI 10-248,
Air National Guard (ANG) Fitness Program until superseded by AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program.
Airmen must meet the minimum requirements for each fitness component in addition to scoring
an overall composite score of 75 points or higher to qualify for any personnel actions, such as
promotion, PME attendance, etc. For Airmen with a documented DLC which prohibits them
from performing one or more components of the Fitness Assessment, an overall "Pass" rating is
required.
7.4. Performance Evaluations. Officer and Enlisted personnel will have Officer Performance
Reports (OPR), Enlisted Performance Reports (EPR) and Performance Feedback Worksheets
(PFW) rendered IAW AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems.
   7.4.1. The unit/wing commander or a designated representative will establish the
   supervisory/evaluation chain and the rating IAW AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted
   Evaluation Systems. The rating chain must include a full-time supervisor (AGR or military
   technician) as the rater, additional rater, or reviewer.
7.5. Training and Developmental Education (DE). AGRs will be afforded the same
opportunity for enhancing their military knowledge and career as is presently available to all
other ANG Airmen. AGRs attend all service schools in AGR status. Orders will indicate the
fund citation for travel and per diem provided under the school quota authorization.
   7.5.1. Ancillary Training. All AGR personnel are required to complete all required ancillary
   training.
   7.5.2. Skills Training. Individuals must continue to progress in training IAW AFI 36-2201,
   Volume 2, Air Force Training Program – Training Management to a skill level compatible
   with their UMD position. If an Airman fails to successfully progress in upgrade training, the
   individual could be reassigned to a qualifying vacant UMD position, involuntarily demoted
   IAW ANGI 36-2503, Administrative Demotion of Airmen, Chapter 3 and/or removed from
   the AGR program.
   7.5.3. Formal Training. Formal training courses listed in the Education and Training Course
   Announcements (ETCA) will be requested when the need for training is mission essential.
   Training requests will be submitted through FSS Force Development.
   7.5.4. Training Waivers. AGRs will use the training waiver procedures currently prescribed
   by AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, Air Force Training Program - Career Field Education and
   Training, Chapter 4 and AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve Personnel Participation and Training
   Procedures, Chapter 8.
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                           29


   7.5.5. Developmental Education (DE). AGRs are afforded the same opportunities for DE as
   other Airmen of the ANG. AGRs may apply for in-residence participation or elect
   completion through distance learning. AGRs may incur an ANG service commitment IAW
   ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within the Air National Guard, upon completion of training.
   7.5.6. Retainability. AGRs will meet appropriate retainability requirements according to the
   education and training course announcements.
7.6. Duties and Work Schedules of Permanent, Occasional and AGR Deployment Backfill
Tour Personnel:
   7.6.1. Duties of AGR personnel will be governed by the functions inherent to the AGR
   positions they occupy on the UMD and Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC).
   7.6.2. AGR Airmen will perform a minimum of forty hours of duty per week. Regular or
   alternate work schedules for AGRs, as approved by TAG, should not deviate from those
   approved for military technicians.
   7.6.3. All AGR Airmen are required to participate with their unit of assignment during Unit
   Training Assemblies (UTA) or equivalent periods of training unless excused from duty IAW
   AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. AGR personnel will also be available to participate
   in annual training periods, deployments, and exercises, when required.
   7.6.4. UTA does not count towards the 40 hour work week commitment.
   7.6.5. AGR Airmen are available for duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week and therefore,
   compensatory time off for duties performed in excess of established working hours is not
   authorized. However, Airmen who earn the privilege may be granted a special pass IAWAFI
   36-3003, Military Leave Program.
7.7. Supervision of Personnel. The concept of the senior military individual being assigned
supervisory responsibilities is an essential element of military service and an inherent part of the
military organizational structure. Supervisory authority for AGR Airmen shall correspond to
military operational lines of authority.
   7.7.1. Commanders will maintain unity of command and integrity of supervisory
   relationships. Military rank is the determining factor when designating supervisory
   responsibilities. Grade inversion is detrimental to the military nature of the ANG and is not
   authorized.
   7.7.2. The assignment of family members to the same unit is only permissible in accordance
   with ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within the Air National Guard.
7.8. AGRs Performing Title 10 Duty. Upon acceptance of an AGR tour and orders, an Airman
provides individual consent to Title 10 duty with the inclusion of the mandatory remarks outlined
in paragraph 6.1.2. Performance of approved and validated Title 10 duty includes Airman’s
consent, command authority, accountability, and fiscal authority. ANG AGR Airmen are still
considered AGRs during the period of Title 10 service, and would be considered serving any
established AGR probationary period concurrently.
30                                                              ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


  7.8.1. AGRs called or ordered to Title 10 federal active duty (OCONUS/CONUS)
  supporting Active Duty requirements for operations/missions/exercises/training (Title 10
  U.S.C. 12301(d), 12302, 12304, or 10147) will not be terminated from their Title 32 U.S.C.
  Section 502(f) orders.
  7.8.2. AGRs Performing Title 10 Duty in Support of Air Force Active Duty
  Requirements. Upon approval and by order of a Federal command authority, AGRs
  performing Title 10 duty for 30 or more consecutive days in support of the active Air Force
  pursuant to Title 10 Sections 12301(d) , 12302 or 12304 for which reimbursement of AGR
  accounts may be required as set forth in paragraph 7.9.4, must have their AGR order
  amended to include in the remarks section the following information: Authority in which
  they are called to Title 10, inclusive dates of the Title 10 duty, named mission they are
  supporting, and active duty MAJCOM they are being tasked to support. An example is as
  follows: ―AGR Airman will convert to Title 10 U.S.C. Section 12301(d) in support of
  OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM from 15 January 2009 to 26 May 2009,
  GMAJCOM: ACC.‖ If the GMAJCOM releases the AGR Airman from Title 10 duty
  sooner than original expiration day, an AGR amendment must reflect the appropriate end
  date of the Title 10 duty.
  7.8.2.1. AGRs placed on Title 10 status for less than 30 consecutive days for which
  reimbursement of AGR accounts may be required as set forth in paragraph 7.9.4, will have
  their Title 10 time documented on AF IMT 1299, Officer’s Certificate of Statement of
  Service. This form must be completed by the unit, certified by the AGR’s commander and
  provided to the Force Support Squadron for update into MiLPDS and to assist in DD Form
  214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty completion Examples of such
  missions that may require an AGR to perform occasional Title 10 duty/day(s) are: Air
  Soverignty Alert (ASA), North East Tanker Task Force (NETTF), Unmanned Aircraft
  Systems (UAS)/Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) (such as Predator, Reaper, Global Hawk),
  Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), State Partnership Program (SPP), etc. A
  sample of AF IMT 1299, Officer’s Certificate of Statement of Service can be found in
  Attachment 15. The AF IMT 1299 will be entered into the Automated Records Management
  System (ARMS) as a source document to an Airman’s records or filed in the Unit Personnel
  Record Group (UPRG), as applicable. Please note this form is applicable to Officers and
  Enlisted Airmen.
  7.8.3. Commanders placed on Title 10 status cannot take Title 32 command action as they
  are (Title 32 U.S.C. Section 325) relieved of their State Title 32 status while federally
  activated on Title 10.
  7.8.4. An AGR while on Title 10 active duty orders must primarily support the active duty
  mission and any Title 32 business conducted should be incidental to that primary support of
  the Title 10 federal mission.
  7.8.5. Title 10 activations (voluntary or involuntary mobilization) of AGRs are normally in
  support of AEF rotations for contingency operations. Title 10 activations of 365 days are
  beyond the intent and purpose of the AGR program.
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                      31



7.9. AGRs Traveling Outside the United States, Its Territories, and Possessions on Official
Duty. DoDD 1215.06, Uniform Reserve, Training, and Retirement Categories, provides that
Airmen must be in Title 10 status when outside the United States, its Territories, and
possessions. Title 32 ANG AGRs may have to travel outside the United States, its Territories,
and possessions in connection with their AGR duties (e.g. AEF Rotations, State Partnership
Program Director etc.). In such cases by accepting entry into the AGR program, the Airman
consents to being automatically converted to Title 10 status under 10 U.S.C. 12301(d) or 10
U.S.C. 10147 (as applicable) for the duration of the OCONUS duty while retaining their status
as AGRs during this period. Therefore, all AGR orders upon acceptance of an AGR tour will
include the mandatory remarks outlined in paragraph 6.1.2.
   7.9.1. Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) orders and other travel (TDY)
   order requirements while performing Title 10 duty. If AGRs are TDY from their home
   station, applicable CED or TDY orders will be published IAW AFI 33-328, Administrative
   Orders, ANGI 33-101, ANG Special Orders, AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Order and AFI
   36-3802, Personnel Readiness Operations.
   7.9.2. Home Station. AGRs activated to Title 10 duty at home station (voluntarily or
   involuntarily) are not required TDY or CED orders. Follow the guidance set forth in
   paragraphs 6.1.2 and 7.8.2 and 7.8.2.1 to document Title 10 duty served in support of active
   duty requirements.
   7.9.3. ..Title 10 Duty Accountability. MilPDS is the Air Force system of record for end-
   strength accounting and tracking activations to include home station active duty. When an
   AGR is activated on Title 10, whether voluntarily or involuntarily for active duty support
   (OCONUS/CONUS), the AGR’s Title 10 active duty tour must be updated in MilPDS.
       7.9.3.1. Source for Updating. Use the amended AGR order for 30 or more days of Title
       10 duty or the validated AF IMT 1299, Officer’s Certificate of Statement of Service, for
       anything less than 30 or more consecutive days. The HRO or office responsible for
       amending AGR orders to reflect an AGR’s Title 10 service will provide a copy to the
       FSS for updates to MilPDS.
          7.9.3.1.1. Ensure the ANG-TECH-ID is updated, or has been updated to a code "3"
          prior to initiating the limited mobilization code "H" or "E" update to prevent pay
          interface transactions from producing.
          7.9.3.1.2. Using the Limited Mobilization application in MilPDS, update the
          following: For Title 10 U.S.C. Section 12301(d) tours, enter volunteer tour with a
          Reserve Active Duty Reason (RADR) equaling code "F"; for Title 10 U.S.C. Section
          12302, enter involuntary tour with a RADR equaling code "H"; and for U.S.C.
          Section 12304, enter tour with a RADR equaling code "E".
   7.9.4. Title 10 Duty Fiscal Authority/Reimbursement for Title 10 Tours. The days
   (dollars) during which an ANG AGR converts to Title 10 in support of active duty
   requirements is reimbursed by Air Force FM. Wing FM offices will ensure the Man-day
   Allocation System (CMAS) is updated in order for the ANG to be reimbursed for applicable
   AGR’s Title 10 active duty. It is imperative from a fiscal perspective, that reimbursement
   requests are updated in CMAS so that appropriations are consistent with the purpose of the
 32                                                                ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


   duty IAW Title 31 U.S.C. 1301(a). Reimbursement is not applicable to Title 10 U.S.C.
   Section 10147. For ANG AGRs on Title 10 duty to support the State Partnership Program,
   reimbursement will be coordinated between NGB-J53-IA and NGB/FM to execute
   reimbursement as needed using existing ANG reimbursement procedures.
   7.9.5. Title 10 Duty Documentation of Service for Title 10 Duty--DD Form 214. The
   FSS will issue a DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty for all
   periods of Title 10 active duty IAW AFI 36-3202, Separation Documents. Refer to
   paragraph 7.8.2 to determine inclusive Title 10 active duty period of service for voluntarily
   or involuntarily for active duty support (Title 10 U.S.C. Sections 12301(d), 12302, or
   12304). To determine inclusive Title 10 active duty period of service for Title 10 training
   (Title 10 U.S.C. 10147) use the validated travel voucher or the AF IMT 1299, Officer’s
   Certificate of Statement of Service.
7.10. Emergency Domestic and ―Immediate Response‖ Situations.
   7.10.1. Emergency Situations. States should be cognizant of the fact that using AGR
   Airmen for emergency domestic situations has fiscal law and Anti-Deficiency Act
   implications and must be governed judiciously.
      7.10.1.1. When an AGR Airman’s unit is ordered to operational Title 32 U.S.C. Section
      502(f)(2), Title 32 U.S.C. Section 502 (a), or State Active Duty (SAD) status to support
      an emergency domestic situation, the AGR Airman may accompany his or her unit and
      continue to perform his or her normal AGR duties.
      7.10.1.2. Since AGR duty is year round military duty, and AGR Airman may not, by
      taking leave, be placed in another military status.
      7.10.1.3. If an AGR Airman has a critical skill set that may be needed by another unit,
      that AGR Airman may be attached to the deploying unit if no other reasonable option
      exits.
      7.10.1.4. This authority applies to individual AGR Airmen and does not constitute
      authority to cross-level significant numbers of AGR Airmen from non-deploying units to
      deploying units.
      7.10.1.5. Support of the operation or mission must be to the extent that doing so does not
      interfere with the performance of his or her primary AGR duties.
      7.10.1.6. For units composed entirely of AGRs and established by law to perform
      specific functions in response to specific emergency domestic situations, such as Civil
      Support Teams (CST), response to those contingency situations by performing those
      functions falls within their normal AGR duties and a request from the President or
      Secretary of Defense is not required to provide this operational response.
   7.10.2. ―Immediate Response‖ Situations. ―Immediate Response‖ is defined by DoDD
   3025.15, paragraph 4.7.1. as ―any form of immediate action taken by a DoD Component or
   military commander to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property
   damage under imminently serious conditions when time does not permit approval from
   higher headquarters.‖.
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                  33


     7.10.2.1. AGRs may support an ―Immediate Response‖ situation. Contingency
     situations of an emergency nature, where AGR Airmen are employed under the
     immediate response doctrine, shall be reported to the Chief, National Guard Bureau

                TOUR CURTAILMENT, SEPARATION, AND RETIREMENT

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. TAG is the final authority for determining whether individuals will be separated from
   the AGR program except for officers within the sanctuary zone who’s separation must be
   approved by the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF). AGR personnel must complete the
   specified period of their orders unless released due to any of the following provisions:
       8.1.1.1. An approved request for voluntary tour curtailment (para 8.4).
       8.1.1.2. An involuntary tour curtailment (para 8.5).
       8.1.1.3. Involuntary release (para 8.6).
       8.1.1.4. Involuntary discharge (para 8.7).
       8.1.1.5. Mandatory separation (para 8.8). .
       8.1.1.6. Retirement – Active Duty (para 8.9).
       8.1.1.7. Retirement – Reserve (para 8.10).
   8.1.2. Refer to Chapter 12 for instructions regarding retention or separation of Airmen
   undergoing medical treatment.
   8.1.3. An AGR Airman who is released from an AGR tour may request a DD Form 2697,
   Report of Medical Assessment upon release from AGR status.
   8.1.4. AGR Airmen separated may be eligible for separation pay based on length of service
   IAW with Title 10 U.S.C. Section 1174 Separation Pay Upon Involuntary Discharge or
   Release From Active Duty, the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation
   (DoDFMR) and JFTR. Unit comptroller or designated representative must counsel AGR
   personnel on the provisions of these entitlements. Reference Attachment 5, NGB 801, Ready
   Reserve Agreement to Receive Separation Pay.
8.2. Sanctuary.
   8.2.1. AGR officers entering the sanctuary zone for regular retirement must be retained until
   reaching retirement eligibility in accordance with Title 10 U.S.C. Section 12646 unless
   separation is approved by SAF. Requests to involuntarily separate an officer from the AGR
   program while in the sanctuary zone must be routed to SAF through NGB/A1.
   8.2.2. Enlisted entering the sanctuary zone for regular retirement should be retained until
   reaching retirement eligibility. However, TAG may involuntarily separate an enlisted
   Airman for cause (reference AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air
   National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members) from the AGR program while in the
   sanctuary zone.
8.3. Separation at Expiration of Tour. 8.3.1 Airmen will be separated from AGR status at the
expiration of their current tour if:
       8.3.1.1. They do not request a subsequent tour, or .
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                        35


       8.3.1.2. They were not selected for continuation in the AGR program. The Airman may
       request reconsideration of the non-renewal of an AGR tour, through command channels,
       to TAG. TAG will make the final determination. Reconsiderations must be submitted to
       the TAG no later than 30 days after notification. TAG is final reconsideration authority.
8.4. Voluntary Tour Curtailment. Normally an AGR must serve 24 months of their current
assignment and complete applicable service commitments before early release is approved.
   8.4.1. AGRs may request early release from their AGR tour based on personal hardship or
   other valid reason. They must submit a fully justified curtailment request through their chain
   of command (including the HRO) to TAG, who is the final approval/disapproval authority.
   This authority may be delegated to the HRO. .
   8.4.2. Airmen who voluntarily request separation from AGR status are not entitled to
   separation pay (Title 10 U.S.C. Section 1174, DoDFMR and JFTR). This includes when an
   Airman voluntarily accepts a position as a military technician.
   8.4.3. Due to end-strength accounting considerations, any voluntary curtailment requests
   submitted between 1 July and 30 September with a requested DOS prior to 31 October can
   only be approved by TAG (for Title 32 State AGRs) or appropriate authority as outlined in
   ANGI 36-6, The Air National Guard Statutory Tour Program Policies and Procedures (for
   Title 10 ANG Statutory Tour AGRs) or delegated authority.
   8.4.4. AGRs who have an approved tour curtailment application and who later request
   withdrawal of the curtailment action, must have approval to withdraw the curtailment from
   the final command signatory for the action.
8.5. Involuntary Tour Curtailment. Commanders considering involuntary curtailment must
use all quality force tools available i.e. referral OPRs/EPRs, LORs, Article 15 etc., prior to
initiating an involuntary curtailment. Depending on the nature of the involuntary curtailment,
commanders may consider discharge in lieu of involuntary curtailment.
   8.5.1. Commanders should initiate a preliminary inquiry with the HRO to determine if an
   involuntary curtailment is appropriate. The commander will notify the Airman, in writing, of
   the proposed action after consulting with HRO.
       8.5.1.1. After acknowledging receipt of commander notification, the Airman may submit
       a written statement within 7 calendar days of notification. The written statement must be
       submitted with the commander’s recommendation to TAG.                  The commander’s
       recommendation for involuntary curtailment must be submitted through the appropriate
       chain of command, with a legal review, to the HRO. TAG will review recommendations
       for involuntary curtailment and will make the final determination. This authority may not
       be delegated. TAG may order a command directed investigation (CDI) IAW AFI 90-
       301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution. The HRO will notify the Airman of an
       approved curtailment and the Airman’s reconsideration rights. If an Airman is eligible
       for Active Duty Sanctuary, refer to AFI 36-2131, Administration of Sanctuary in the Air
       Reserve Components.
   8.5.2. Involuntary Curtailment Reconsideration. An approved curtailment may be submitted
   for reconsideration to TAG only if significant new information is obtained. Curtailment
 36                                                                 ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


   action will continue while pending reconsideration. If a written request for reconsideration is
   not filed, reconsideration rights will be waived.
       8.5.2.1. Reconsideration memorandums, along with any supporting documentation, shall
       be submitted directly to HRO for staffing to TAG. Airmen must notify HRO in writing
       of their intent to reconsideration an involuntary curtailment within 7 calendar days of
       receipt of notification memorandum. Reconsideration packages must be received by
       HRO within 21 calendar days of receipt of notification memorandum.
       8.5.2.2. HRO will notify the Airman of the reconsideration outcome and notify the
       Airman’s chain of command of any further processing requirements.
   8.5.3. If an Airman is involuntarily curtailed and is under a bonus contract (ACP, Medical
   bonus, CSB, etc.), the bonus contract will be terminated upon the expiration date of the AGR
   order established by the involuntary curtailment. Repayment of any unearned portion of the
   bonus will be determined by NGB Office of Primary Responsibility or DFAS, as appropriate.
8.6. Involuntary Release. Mission realignments, total force initiatives, Base Realignment and
Closure (BRAC), end-strength limitations or other force management actions may require
involuntary release of an AGR prior to the AGR tour end-date. HRO will manage the
involuntary release process and Airmen will be notified of all actions and requirements
associated with this release. The notification will stipulate if the reduction affects AGR
personnel only and provides an effective date of the RIF IAW paragraph 10.5. If an AGR is
eligible for AD Sanctuary, refer to AFI 36-2131, Administration of Sanctuary in the Air Reserve
Components. AGR Airmen separated may be eligible for separation pay based on length of
service IAW with Title 10 U.S.C. Section 1174, the DoDFMR and JFTR. Unit comptroller or
designated representative must counsel AGR Airmen on the provisions of these entitlements
(Reference Attachment 5). See AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.
8.7. Involuntary Discharge. Commanders may initiate involuntary discharge actions for
officers and enlisted personnel. See AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for

      9.6.1.1. ACB Worksheet Non-Concurrence. Written documentation shall be provided to
      the board for consideration anytime there is non-concurrence in the reviewing chain.
   9.6.2. If the Airman believes the documents are inaccurate or incomplete, he or she must
   bring that purported deficiency in writing to the attention of the HRO as soon as possible, but
   in any event no later than 15 days prior to the board.
   9.6.3. If the Airman does not concur with the commander’s recommendation on the ACB
   Worksheet, Airman may submit a personal letter to the ACB. The letter may describe any
   matter of record concerning the Airman that is believed to be important for the ACB’s
   consideration. Letters of recommendation from other individuals cannot be submitted. All
   the information in the Airman’s letter must be accurate and, if called on to do so, the Airman
   must provide evidence to support any questioned information. To be considered by the ACB,
   the letter must be addressed to the ACB and received by the HRO NLT 15 days prior to the
   ACB.
   9.6.4. The HRO will review all ACB Worksheet’s to insure supervisor and commander
   recommendations, to include Airman’s signature of acknowledgement are received.

   9.7.1. All proceedings will be held in closed session. AGR Airmen being considered by the
   ACB will receive fair and impartial consideration. ACB will be free from any improper
   command or other influences in the performances of its duties or as a result of such
   performance. Board members may not discuss or consider outside communications or
   materials not otherwise contained in the material properly presented before the ACB. Board
   members will not communicate with anyone outside the board membership in reference to
   the board proceedings. Individuals appointed to the ACB will be administered an oath

   interest of other Airmen.
   9.7.3. The ACB reviews enlisted and officer AGR Airmen for entry into ―career status‖
   and/or for continuation beyond 20 years total active federal military service. Individual
   career intentions, supervisor and chain of command recommendations are required for each
   Airman reviewed by the ACB as documented on the ACB Worksheet. It is not the
   responsibility of the board to screen AGR records to determine whether AGR Airmen have
   met the administrative requirements of the AGR Program. Occasional and AGR deployment
   backfill tours are term limited and will not meet an ACB for consideration of career status.
   9.7.4. The ACB decisions are based on the needs of the unit, State, and Air National Guard.
   The ACB will consider: the Airman’s ACB Worksheet that lists their desire to participate in
   the AGR Program and their supervisor/commander recommendations, the ACB Profile (see
   Table 9.1), the ―whole person‖ concept and current and future force structure. The ―whole
 42                                                                   ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


   person‖ concept considers the individual’s total background [promotion potential, time in
   grade, time in position, training/developmental education, duty history (work experience),
   performance reports (OPRs/EPRs), physical fitness results, awards and decorations and any
   official disciplinary actions a matter of record, i.e. letter of reprimand, etc. Each individual’s
   service history is reviewed to determine the individual’s ability to attain 20 years TAFMS
   and to determine if the Airman’s participation in the career program will meet the needs of
   the unit, State, and ANG. Continuation is dependent on continued performance, career
   progression, needs of the unit, State, ANG, and career field requirements.
   9.7.5. The board will be furnished with a listing of all Airmen to be considered including as
   a minimum the following documentation for each Airman: the ACB Worksheet, relevant
   personnel information as determined by the State to conduct ―whole person‖ concept review,
   and any letters submitted by the Airman to the board IAW paragraph 9.6.3. Documents
   prepared or submitted specifically for board use will be disposed of IAW AFI 33-364,
   Records Disposition – Procedures and Responsibilities.
   9.7.6. The ACB will not be used to terminate AGR orders of those Airmen who should have
   been removed from the AGR Program under the provisions of paragraphs 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, and
   8.8, of this instruction.
9.8. ACB Post-Board Process. The recorder will publish a report of the ACB actions and
recommendations, using Attachment 11, AGR Continuation Board (ACB) Report Format as a
guide, to be submitted to The Adjutant General NLT 15 days from the board completion date.
The recommendations of the ACB are not binding on The Adjutant General but will be given
serious consideration. Other than the ACB Report and possible ACB Minority Report
(Attachment 12), no record of the ACB proceedings will be prepared.
   9.8.1. The report captures the board recommended actions: entry into career program,
   continuation beyond 20 years active service, or non-continuation on AGR tour.
   Memorandums of notification will be prepared and forwarded to each Airman and leadership
   indicating the ACB decision. Normally, notifications will be provided to each individual
   within 60 days following the ACB.
   9.8.2. Any ACB member who disagrees with the recommendation of the majority of the
   board may submit a minority report using Attachment 12, AGR Continuation Board (ACB)
   Minority Report Format, as a guide. The board member will sign both the minority report
   and the board proceedings, indicating on the board proceedings that a minority report is
   being submitted as an attachment to the ACB Report.
   9.8.3. The Adjutant General will review the recommendations of the ACB, and approve or
   disapprove any or all specific recommendations. The Adjutant General is the final approval
   authority on all actions and may disapprove a board in its entirety if substantial material
   errors and/or procedural deficiencies are found.
      9.8.3.1. Post-review ACB memorandums of notification communicating the ACB
      decisions will be prepared for each commander to brief their affected Airmen. See
      Attachment 13, Post-review AGR Continuation Board (ACB) Notification Memorandum
      (Commander). Each Airman will be required to sign a statement to acknowledge
      notification of ACB results (Reference Attachment 14, AGR Continuation Board (ACB)
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                         43


       Member Acknowledgement of Decision Notification). Normally, notifications will be
       provided to each individual NLT 30 days after TAG approval of Board proceedings.
9.9. Entry into the AGR Career Program. The ACB may review for entry into the AGR
Career Program. Requests and recommendations for career AGR status are reviewed and
approved by TAG.
   9.9.1. AGR Career Status may be granted to individuals regardless of their ability to attain
   20 years TAFMS prior to MSD or maximum age. Airmen granted career status (successive
   tour) shall be administered with the understanding that their service may lead to a military
   retirement after attaining the required years of TAFMS. However, career status does not
   guarantee continuation to 20 years of TAFMS and an AD retirement. Continuation to 20
   years of TAFMS and beyond is contingent on individual performance, career progression,
   mission requirements, force management and the needs of the unit, State, and ANG.
   9.9.2. Reassignment to a new follow-on AGR position that exceeds the initial probationary
   tour will eliminate the requirement to meet an ACB. Career status will be granted at that
   time.
   9.9.3. AGRs who have been approved for entry into the AGR career program and
   subsequently separate from the AGR program will forfeit their career status. Officer and
   enlisted Airmen who return to the AGR program will serve a new probationary period and be
   reconsidered for entry into the career program IAW this instruction.
9.10. Continuation Beyond 20 years Active Service. A follow-on tour for an Airman who has
attained 20 years TAFMS or more is primarily dependent upon the needs of the unit, State, and
ANG.
   9.10.1. Approved extensions will normally be one to two years in length. Airmen would
   then be required to meet another ACB at the end of the approved extension period. Any
   extension beyond two years should be justified.
9.11. Non-continuation on AGR Tour. Airmen not selected for entry into the career program
or continuation beyond 20 years of total active federal military service will be provided at least
180 days notification prior to their expiration of their AGR order.
   9.11.1. Airmen not selected for entry into the AGR career program or for continuation after
   achieving 20 years active service will be released from active duty on the expiration of their
   AGR orders.
   9.11.2. Airmen not continued by an ACB are still eligible to apply for and accept a new
   AGR assignment as long as they are reenlistment eligible (enlisted) and are not restricted by
   MSD, age, or another mandatory separation reason. If selected for a new AGR assignment,
   the Airman’s date of separation will be adjusted so that they can accept the assignment.
9.12. ACB Reconsideration Process. The final reconsideration authority for the ACB decision
is TAG. An AGR Airman may request reconsideration of an ACB decision by forwarding their
request with supporting documentation to HRO for staffing. Reconsiderations must arrive at
HRO within 30 days of the date on the ACB decision memorandum.
   9.12.1. Supporting justification, not provided with the original ACB Worksheet, may be
   provided. The reconsideration request must be reviewed and endorsed in a timely manner by
 44                                                                 ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


   each level of command to HRO processing. Endorsements must include support or non-
   support of the individual’s request with additional rationale.
        9.12.1.1. Reconsideration requests received without the appropriate chain of command
        coordination will be returned to the Airman without action. Reconsiderations must be
        received by HRO within 30 days of the date on the memorandum of notification of the
        ACB decision. The Airman’s chain of command will not hold a reconsideration request
        to circumvent the 30 day submission requirement.
   9.12.2. The reconsideration decision of the TAG is final.       There is no reconsideration
   beyond the TAG.
9.13. Out-of-Cycle ACB. An out-of-cycle ACB may be requested by an Airman or their
leadership chain if a retention decision is required outside the normal ACB process. An out-of-
cycle ACB shall not be used in lieu of an involuntary curtailment.
   9.13.1. Processing Procedures. An out-of-cycle ACB request should be forwarded to HRO
   for staffing. HRO will staff to TAG for decision. A notification memorandum will be
   prepared and forwarded to the Airman and leadership indicating the out-of-cycle ACB
   decision. If career status is denied, the normal reconsideration and notification process will
   apply.

               PRIORITY PLACEMENT AND REDUCTION IN FORCE

10.1. Priority Placement of Overgrade Airmen. The Priority Placement Program (PPP) is
designed for the management of overgrade AGR Airmen. Reductions in Force (RIF) actions
take precedence over the PPP. Because of unique mission requirements and unit force
management plans, each HRO must develop written PPP procedures that incorporate the
following:
   10.1.1. Ensure that the fewest number of personnel are administratively reduced in grade or
   released from AGR status.
   10.1.2. Ensure that AGR personnel in an overgrade status and military technicians in a
   retained grade status will be given simultaneous PPP consideration. Neither category has
   priority over the other.
   10.1.3. Placement must be based on the least amount of impact to the individual and the
   mission.
10.2. Implementation of PPP. 10.2.1 AGR personnel who become overgrade to their UMD
assignment will be entered into the PPP as described below.
      10.2.1.1. Airmen will be entered in the PPP on the same date as the action that causes
      them to become overgrade for a maximum of 24 months or until the situation is resolved,
      whichever comes first. For overgrade situations that exceed 24 months, the Airman must
      be separated, retired, or demoted. Demotions apply to enlisted Airmen only.
      10.2.1.2. The HRO will notify an Airman in writing (with an information copy to the
      FSS) that the AGR Airman has been placed in the PPP. In addition, Airman will be
      notified 90 days prior to the expiration of the PPP by the HRO.
   10.2.2. An Airman in the PPP will be offered, in writing, the first available UMD full-time
   AGR position within the State for which the Airman is fully qualified for assignment as
   outlined in Chapter 6.
      10.2.2.1. The written offer will identify the position, unit of assignment and unit
      location.
      10.2.2.2. The position offered should be in a unit within normal commuting distance of
      the Airman's residence. This does not preclude entitlement to PCS, if reassigned to
      another installation.
   10.2.3. Overgrade AGR Airmen must accept or decline a position offered under the PPP
   within 10 workdays of the date of receipt of the written offer. If the Airman accepts the
   position, the HRO will direct the FSS to reassign the Airman within 30 days of acceptance of
   the position.
   10.2.4. An overgrade enlisted AGR Airman      who declines a position offered under the PPP
   must be reduced in grade to the maximum       grade of the UMD position not later than 30
   workdays after the declination IAW ANGI       36-2503, Administrative Demotion of Airmen.
   Officers will be separated from AGR status.   However, if the officer is within the sanctuary
 46                                                                 ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


   zone then the officer must be retained until eligible for a regular (active duty) retirement
   IAW Title 10 U.S.C Section 8911.
   10.2.5. TAG may approve the retention of an Airman in the PPP after the individual has
   declined an offered position if the declination was based on justifiable circumstances which
   would have created a severe hardship for the Airman.
10.3. Notification of Overgrade. HROs or designated representatives must counsel AGR
personnel on the provisions of this chapter and ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within the Air
National Guard within 30 days of the date that they become overgrade.
10.4. Reduction in Force. Reduction in Force (RIF) is designed to manage those AGR Airmen
who become excess to a State’s AGR RAs.
   10.4.1. HRO administers and manages placement programs for AGRs in the event of force
   reductions, requirements and/or mission change.
   10.4.2. Officers and enlisted serving on AGR tours may be involuntarily separated due to a
   reduction in AGR RAs.
   10.4.3. Placement based on RIF action takes precedence over placement due to PPP actions.
   10.4.4. AGR Airmen who have between 18 and 20 years of active duty are in the sanctuary
   zone are exempt from RIF action.
   10.4.5. Individuals may be eligible for separation pay based on length of service IAW with
   Title 10 U.S.C. Section 1174, the DoDFMR and JFTR. Unit comptroller or designated
   representative must counsel AGR personnel on the provisions of these entitlements
   (Reference Attachment 5).
10.5. Implementation of RIF.
   10.5.1. When NGB/A1M notifies the State of a reduction in AGR RA, the HRO will do the
   following:
      10.5.1.1. Notify commanders to identify which functional areas are to be reduced based
      on mission requirements. The HRO will place all AGR personnel within those functional
      areas on an AGR RIF Register.
      10.5.1.2. Ensure that reductions are first accomplished by normal attrition, hiring freezes,
      and separation of retirement eligible Airmen.
   10.5.2. Individuals who are eligible for an immediate active duty retirement will be
   separated from the AGR program before conducting a RIF board unless specifically
   authorized for retention by TAG (this authority may not be delegated).
      10.5.2.1. Retention will only be authorized for mission essential reasons when the
      individual possesses unique military qualifications that are not readily available.
      10.5.2.2. Retention will not be authorized for the sole benefit of the Airman.
   10.5.3. Provide written notification to affected personnel of the RIF board to be held and the
   procedures that will be followed.
   10.5.4. Convene a board of ANG personnel to prioritize affected Airmen placed on a RIF
   register.
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                       47


      10.5.4.1. Airmen must be given written notification at least 90 calendar days prior to
      separation.
      10.5.4.2. Airmen will be counseled on transition assistance benefits.
   10.5.5. New hires will only be authorized after every effort has been made to place AGR
   Airmen affected by the RIF.
   10.5.6. AGR Airmen who have not been placed must be given written notification of
   separation no later than 90 days prior to the reduction in AGR RA.
10.6. AGR RIF Boards.
   10.6.1. Boards will be comprised of at least three members, equal to or senior in grade to
   those being considered. The board president will be the senior member on the board. All
   board members will be present for all board sessions. Board composition should be
   reflective of the Airmen considered for possible RIF actions, to include female and/or
   minority representation if appropriate.
   10.6.2. The board will consider the following factors in establishing order precedence on the
   register.
      10.6.2.1. Career Status—placement for career AGRs will take precedence over non-
      career AGRs.
      10.6.2.2. Performance evaluations.
      10.6.2.3. Professional Military Education and Civilian Education.
      10.6.2.4. Technician Reemployment Rights.
      10.6.2.5. AFSC Qualifications.
      10.6.2.6. Military mission requirements.

                             RECRUITING AND RETENTION

11.1. General:
   11.1.1. All recruiting personnel currently serving in the 8R000 SDI are encouraged to pursue
   career broadening assignments. Recruiting and Retention personnel will not be assigned
   additional duties that interfere with their primary responsibilities. Recruiters and Retention
   Office Managers (ROMs) are expected to be available during UTAs and at times when their
   ―customers‖ are available. Reference paragraph 7.6. for duties of AGR personnel.
11.2. Entry Grade/Skill Level Qualifications. All Recruiting and Retention tours will begin
after successful completion of any USAF Recruiting School.
   11.2.1. Entry Level Production Recruiters: Rank of SrA through TSgt; 5-level in any AFSC
   is required except in those instances where a 5-level does not exist; and 18 months ANG
   membership is desirable.

   11.2.5. Recruiters and Retention Superintendents (RRS): Rank of SMSgt, or a promotable
   MSgt; minimum two years experience in Air Component recruiting and/or retention is
   required. Eighteen months ANG membership is desirable.
11.3. Selection Process:
   11.3.1. Selection and assignment to vacant Recruiting and Retention positions must be
   within the authorized grade limits specified for the positions. Recruiting and Retention
   resources are ―fenced‖, and therefore cannot be realigned from the program. The Recruiters
   and Retention Superintendent (RRS) must be directly involved in the selection process for
   Recruiting and Retention Staff.
11.4. Length of Tours:
   11.4.1. It is important that State and unit supervisors create a Force Management Plan that
   will enable deserving Recruiting and Retention personnel an opportunity for upward
   mobility. .
   11.4.2. All Recruiting and Retention tours will be based on State AGR hiring guidelines.
   Tour extensions beyond the initial tour should be approved if the production and/or
   performance levels of the recruiter or ROM have consistently been met.
   11.4.3. All Recruiting and Retention positions are validated by NGB/RS prior to vacancy
   announcement or tour renewal to ensure authorized and assigned personnel/grades are within
   the RA of the current ANG Recruiting and Retention Manpower Guide.
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                       49


11.5. Occasional Tours:
   11.5.1. Occasional Recruiting and Retention tours are authorized for short periods of time to

   normally not exceed 179 days in a fiscal year. Provisions of paragraph 13.4 apply. .
11.6. Tour Termination:
   11.6.1. Termination of Recruiting and Retention tours, when necessary, must be handled
   expediently IAW ANGI 36-2602, ANG Recruiting Expenditures and Management of
   Recruiting and Retention Programs and this instruction.
   11.6.2. The immediate supervisor will furnish the Airman a memorandum counseling
   statement when production or expected performance standards are not being met. The
   Airman will be given adequate time, as determined by supervisor and RRS, IAW ANGI 36-
   2602, ANG Recruiting Expenditures and Management of Recruiting and Retention

                                         MEDICAL

12.1. General. Within the context of federal law, the health and well being of ANG Airmen
must always be a prime consideration in any decision concerning their assignment, utilization,
retention or separation.
12.2. Eligibility for AGR Tours:
   12.2.1. Individuals selected for AGR tours must meet the Preventative Health Assessment
   (PHA)/physical qualifications outlined in AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Standards.
   They must also be current in all Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) requirements to include
   immunizations. RCPHA/PHA and dental must be conducted not more than 12 months prior
   to entry on AGR duty and an HIV test must be completed not more than six months prior to
   the start date of the AGR tour. Individuals transferring from Title 10 (Regular Air Force or
   Reserve Component Title 10 Statutory Tour) are not required to have a new physical unless
   the previous physical is over 12 months old at time of entry into AGR status.
       12.2.1.1. Individuals on a DD Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report at the time of
       AGR physical package evaluation will not be deemed medically qualified. Individuals
       may apply for AGR tours as long as meet the aforementioned requirement and
       subsequently are medically cleared off any DLC/medical profile prior to starting a new
       AGR tour. An initial AGR order will not be published prior to ensuring the selected
       applicant is off any duty limitations before starting their AGR tour.
   12.2.2. Airmen determined physically qualified for continued military service IAW AFI 48-
   123, Medical Examinations and Standards, by the State Air Surgeon (or designated
   representative) or Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) may enter on AGR duty
   immediately. Transfers from other service components may use the DD Form 2807-1,
   Report of Medical Histor, DD Form 2807-2, Medical Prescreen of Report of Medical
   History, and DD Form 2808, Report of Medical Examination. DD Form 2807/2808 or their
   service specific PHA or RCPHA-equivalent as proof of examination as long as it is current
   within 12 months and meets standards. The State Air Surgeon will forward questionable
   cases and those cases which do not meet continued military service standards IAW AFI 48-
   123, Medical Examinations and Standards for waiver consideration to NGB/SGPR for
   review, disposition and approval prior to entry on AGR duty. Local Medical Groups will
   ensure that the most current AGR Medical Cover Sheet is included with required
   documentation to the State Air Surgeon.
   12.2.3. Airmen selected for permanent, occasional and AGR deployment backfill tours must
   also meet the criteria for entry listed in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
12.3. Medical Care.
   12.3.1. AGR Airmen are authorized medical care IAW AFI 41-115, Authorized Health Care
   and Health Care Benefits in the Military Health Services System and AFI 41-101, Obtaining
   Alternative Medical and Dental Care. AGR Airmen receiving care through an Active Duty
   Medical Treatment Facility (ADMTF) will have their medical records checked out to that
   ADMTF for the duration of that assignment.
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                       51


   12.3.2. The Airman or supervisor must inform the servicing ANG medical facility of any
   changes in the Airman's medical status.
   12.3.3. AGR personnel will be counseled that scheduling elective surgery (AFI 44-102,
   Medical Care Management, Chapter 6) without approval of the Air/Detachment/Mission
   Commander may be considered as an abuse of privileges and may result in disciplinary
   action.
   12.3.4. Pregnancy. Medical benefits for pregnant AGR Airmen are authorized in AFI 41-
   115, Authorized Health Care and Health Care Benefits in the Military Health Services
   System. Policies established by HQ USAF and NGB/SG must be consulted for further
   guidance. The following policies apply regarding extension/separation of pregnant Airmen:
      12.3.4.1. An Airman cannot be released involuntarily prior to expiration of a tour solely
      because of pregnancy.
      12.3.4.2. Airmen on AGR tours, other than occasional and AGR deployment backfill
      tours, may be continued or released as planned, regardless of the pregnancy. Tours may
      not be extended merely to provide medical coverage for non-complicated pregnancies.
      AGRs with complicated pregnancies must provide medical documentation from their
      provider to their servicing ANG Medical Group. Benefits for medical coverage are IAW
      AFI 41-115, Authorized Health Care and Health Care Benefits in the Military Health
      Services System.
      12.3.4.3. Occasional and AGR deployment backfill tours will expire as indicated on the
      orders. Occasional tours will not be extended for complicated or non-complicated
      pregnancies.
   12.3.5. AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, defines medical conditions for
   possible Medical Evaluation Board consideration. Commanders, supervisors, medical
   personnel and the member can assist with prompt identification of medical issues that may
   impact continued worldwide service. Prompt identification of these issues will facilitate
   effective management of these cases and ensure consideration of all benefits and entitlements
   in the event of an MEB is required.
      12.3.5.1. AGR Airmen are expected to meet mobilization and deployment standards
      IAW DoDI 1205.18, Full-Time Support (FTS) to the Reserve Components. AGR Airmen
      do not have rights to remain in AGR status to attain or maximize longevity benefits if the
      Airman does not remain qualified for continued worldwide duty. .
      12.3.5.2. AGR Airmen will schedule their PHAs with the ADMTF that is responsible for
      their medical care and the ADMTF will update the Preventative Health Assessment and
      Individual Medical Readiness (PIMR) status.
12.4. Retention/Release of Airmen:
   12.4.1. An AGR Airman may request a DD Form 2697, Report of Medical Assessment upon
   release from AGR status. The DD Form 2697 will be provided by the ADMTF that is
   responsible for the AGR Airman’s healthcare.
52                                                                 ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010


  12.4.2. AGR Airmen, including those on occasional and AGR deployment backfill tours
  over 30 days, who are not offered a follow-on tour will not be involuntarily released from
  AGR status while medically incapacitated, unless as a result of action IAW AFI 36-3212,
  Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separations. Orders will be published
  extending the tour until a final determination is made. If the Airman is subsequently found to
  be medically disqualified for continued military service, the individual will be separated or
  discharged IAW AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and
  Separation.

                  DEPLOYMENT BACKFILL TOURS

13.1. Use of AGR Resources. All AGRs (career, probationary, occasional, and backfills) must
be assigned to validated Unit Manning Document (UMD) positions compatible with their
military grade and AFSC/SDI. AGR overgrades are not permitted and excesses are not
authorized without prior approval from NGB/A1.
   13.1.1. New Roles and Missions. The appropriate hiring authority may take advance
   recruiting actions only when coordinated with HRO (for Title 32 State AGRs) or NGB/HR
   (for ANG Title 10 Statutory Tour AGRs) and authorized by NGB/A1M. New accessions or
   promotions will not be authorized prior to new positions being funded, validated, and
   effective on the appropriate UMD unless authorized by NGB/A1.
13.2. Accountability and Funding. NGB/A1M is responsible for resource allocation, control
of AGR manpower resources and controlled grades, and budgetary instruction/direction to NGB
Statutory Tour, and each State and Territory AGR.
   13.2.1. The number of funded AGRs assigned cannot exceed the Congressional end-strength
   ceiling as of 30 September of each fiscal year (FY). Additionally, grade authorization
   ceilings are established in each fiscal year by the National Defense Authorization Act
   (NDAA).
       13.2.1.1. Due to Office of Secretary Defense (OSD) accounting rules, personnel on
       permanent, occasional, and AGR deployment backfill tours count toward overall ANG
       AGR end-strength.and controlled grade ceilings while in AGR status. This includes
       NGB (Title 10 ANG Statutory Tour AGRs) and State/Territory (Title 32 AGRs). ANG
       manpower and personnel execution is reported to OSD at the end of every month and
       recorded as part of the Reserve Component. The final ANG position for any fiscal year
       is recorded as of 30 Sep of that year.
       13.2.1.2. Manpower Resource Allocations (RA) and controlled grade ceilings will not be
       exceeded without prior written approval from NGB/A1M.
       13.2.1.3. Due to end-strength accounting considerations, any voluntary curtailment
       requests IAW paragraph 8.4, submitted between 1 July and 30 September with a
       requested DOS prior to 31 October can only be approved by TAG (for Title 32 State
       AGRs) or appropriate authority as outlined in ANGI 36-6, ANG Statutory Tour Program
       Policies and Procedures (for Title 10 ANG Statutory Tour AGRs) or delegated authority.
   13.2.2. All AGR personnel must be accounted for in ANG end-strength and military
   personnel reporting systems. The Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) is not
   the system utilized for reporting official AGR assigned strength. AGR personnel must be
   coded within the current Personnel Data System according to Attachment 4 and AFCSM 36-
   699 Vol 1, Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) User Guidelines. Official AGR
   assigned strength numbers are derived from a data extract from the MilPDS.
 54                                                                  ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010



13.3. Controlled Grade Ceilings. AGRs are managed within the congressionally mandated
end-strength authorizations for Senor Master Sergeant, Chief Master Sergeant, Major, Lieutenant
Colonel, and Colonel IAW Title 10 U.S.C., Sections 12011 (officers) and 12012 (enlisted).
These ceilings are approved upon the signature of the National Defense Authorization Act.
Assignment or promotion to these controlled grades cannot exceed the annually established
military duty end-strength or grade ceilings.
   13.3.1. NGB/A1M is responsible for allocating controlled grades to NGB, all States and
   Territories.
   13.3.2. NGB, States, and Territories must adhere to their controlled grade limits as
   established by NGB/A1M. The controlled grade ceilings by grade are the maximum
   available on any given day.
   13.3.3. All restorations, promotions, new hires, occasional and AGR deployment backfill
   personnel (not on MPA Man-day program) must be accommodated within the controlled
   grade ceiling on any given day to adhere to approved OSD end-strength accounting rules.
   13.3.4. All colonel controlled grades are centrally managed by NGB for each State or
   Territory.
       13.3.4.1. All AGR colonel promotion nominations will be submitted by each State or
       Territory as a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) IAW ANGI 36-2504, Federal Recognition
       of Promotion in the Air National Guard (ANG) and as a Reserve of the Air Force Below
       the Grade of General Officer.
       13.3.4.2. Prior written approval from NGB/A1M for O-6 accessions is mandatory.
       13.3.4.3. All AGR colonel grades once vacated are automatically returned to NGB/A1M
       for redistribution.
13.4. Occasional Tours and AGR Deployment Backfills.
   13.4.1. Occasional Tours. Occasional Tours will be for a minimum of 31 consecutive days
   but less than 179 days to fulfill validated full-time workload already documented on the
   UMD as full-time requirements (duty AFSC and grade on full-time UMD must match).
   Occasional tours support full-time requirements on the UMD and need not be advertised
   through normal announcement procedures as referenced in paragraph 4.1.2. However, the
   selectee must meet all AGR program accession requirements IAW Chapter 5 and Chapter 12.
   The intent of an occasional tour is to temporarily fill a full-time requirement short term while
   that requirement is being advertised and hired. Vacant AGR resources will not be filled by
   continuous occasional tours being served by multiple Airmen or the same Airman.
       13.4.1.1. There is no authority to unilaterally establish new workload requirements for
       AGRs. Operational Readiness Inspection/Unit Compliance Inspection (ORI/UCI)
       preparation is considered organic workload to existing documented full-time
       requirements on the UMD and not additional or temporary workload.
       13.4.1.2. The maximum tour length is 179 days. Airmen must have at least a 31 day
       break in AGR service to be put on a second occasional AGR tour. All occasional tours
ANGI36-101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                       55


       are accommodated within the State’s current resource allocations. Occasional tours will
       not require a MCR action.
       13.4.1.3. AGR occasional tour personnel must be managed within the State’s resource
       allocation and controlled grade ceiling on any given day to adhere to approved OSD end-
       strength accounting rules. For example, you cannot use an officer resource to hire an
       enlisted person and vice versa.
   13.4.2. AGR Deployment Backfills. AGRs activated under Title 10 and deployed away
   from home station for 31 days or more may be backfilled (in-kind: AFSC, grade, and AGR
   category). Exceptions must be reviewed through HRO to NGB/A1M and the Functional
   Manager in turn, for approval.
       13.4.2.1. If AFSC and grade is not available, the HRO has the authority to approve a
       backfill with an Airman within the 2 digit AFS not to exceed the deployed AGR’s
       authorized grade on the UMD.
       13.4.2.2. The backfill is authorized only for the specific period of the incumbent’s
       deployment. This does not include pre-deployment preparation nor the incumbent’s
       return from deployment, to include the deployed Airman’s leave and reconstitution time.
       Copies of CED orders must be provided to HRO to determine backfill inclusive dates.
   13.4.2.3. AGR authorizations, which are not backfilled, regardless of the amount of time,
   are not ―bankable‖ for future use.
       13.4.2.4. Due to Office of Secretary Defense (OSD) accounting rules, personnel on AGR
       occasional tour/backfill orders (not MPA Man-day program) count against the State or
       Territory AGR strength and controlled grade ceilings (if applicable) while in AGR status.
       13.4.2.5. All backfills must be coded in MilPDS with a TECH-ID code of "3" indicating
       an AGR status. The correct Active Duty Status Code should be a "U" (Temp Tour Other)
       with the approved start and stop dates of the AGR orders, place ordered to active duty,
       and Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD).
13.5. Counter Drug Support. By law, Airmen performing support to Counter Drug cannot be.
Title 32 AGRs under Title 32 U.S.C. Section 502(f).
13.6. MCR AGR Grade Comparability. See Table 13.1, Manpower Change Request (MCR)
Grade Comparability Table.
   13.6.1. Table 13.1 is used to determine the ―highest possible AGR grade‖ for an AGR
   position (RIC ―0034‖ or ―0148‖) or a Technician (RIC ―0170‖) position converting into an
   AGR (RIC ―0034‖ or ―0148‖) position based on available military grades in the work center
   that have the same AFS and control grade availability.

MEMORANDUM FOR (Individual)
FROM:
SUBJECT: Notification of Calendar Year (CY) (XXXX) ANG AGR Continuation Board (ACB)
  You will be considered by the ACB to be convened on or about (date). The AGR
Continuation Board (ACB) will review any Airman with an AGR tour end date in CY (XXXX)
and either is completing their probationary tour for possible entrance into the career program
and/or for continuation beyond 20 years of total active federal military service. The review will
determine continuation within the AGR Program.
   Your AGR Continuation Board Worksheet has been provided to your Commander for
completion. This is an opportunity for you and your supervisor to discuss career goals and
objectives to ensure you understand their expectations, as well as understand your possible future
in the AGR Program. You will be required to acknowledge you were briefed on your
supervisor’s recommendation. If you do not concur with the recommendation, you may submit a
letter to ACB. Your letter may describe any matter of record concerning you that is believed to
be important for the ACB’s consideration. You cannot submit letters of recommendation from
other individuals. All the information in the letter must be accurate and if called on to do so, you
must provide evidence to support any questioned information. To be considered by the ACB, the
letter must be addressed to ACB and received by HRO NLT 15 days prior to the ACB. You
have an affirmative obligation to carefully and completely review the documents that will be
submitted to the ACB. If you believe the documents are inaccurate or incomplete, you must
bring that purported deficiency in writing to the attention of HRO as soon as possible, but in any
event no later than 15 days before the board meets.
  The TAG will convene the ACB, consisting of at least three voting members, equal to or
senior in grade to those being considered (and will include the ANG State Command Chief or
CMSgt), to assist in determining which Airmen should be continued in the AGR Program based
on the needs of the ANG. Sound personnel management of the AGR Program requires a
constant evaluation of the dynamics of the composition of the force to meet force shaping
requirements.
  An ACB decision to grant an extension or continuation of an AGR Airman is in the AGR
Program, not for a specific assignment. Continuation is dependent on continued performance,
career progression, needs of the unit, State, ANG and career field requirements.
ACB results will be provided on or about (date). Please contact your Human Resource Manager
for questions or to receive additional assistance with this process.

MEMORANDUM FOR (Commander)
FROM:
SUBJECT: Results – Calendar Year (XXXX) AGR Continuation Board
         Attached are the Calendar Year (XXXX) AGR Continuation Board (ACB) results for
your unit. Each of your affected Airmen must be notified by you in person no later than
(date). During notification, you must ensure that each Airman completes and signs a CY
(XXXX) ACB Member Acknowledgement of Decision Notification. A copy of the signed
acknowledgement must be provided to State HRO for each Airman NLT (date).
         Each individual will be contacted by HRO, on or about (date), and provided specific
instructions. Based on their ACB result, these instructions will prepare them for either
subsequent extension, return to drill status Guardsman, or retirement.
AGR Airman may request reconsideration of their ACB decision in writing. The Airman must
justify why the ACB result is not in the best interest of the (State) Air National Guard.
Supporting justification, not provided with the original ACB Worksheet, may be provided. The
reconsideration request must be reviewed and endorsed in a timely manner by each level of
command to HRO for processing. Endorsements must include support or non-support of
individual’s request with additional rationale. Reconsideration requests received without the
appropriate chain of command coordination will be returned to the Airman without action.
Reconsiderations must be received by HRO within 30 days of the date on the memorandum of
notification of the ACB decision. The Airman’s chain of command will not hold a
reconsideration request to circumvent the 30 day submission requirement. The reconsideration
decision of the The Adjutant General (TAG) is final. There is no reconsideration beyond the
TAG.
 The point of contact for this issue is (rank, name, office symbol), commercial (XXX) XXX-
XXXX, DSN XXX-XXXX, or email (XXXXX@XXXX.mil).
