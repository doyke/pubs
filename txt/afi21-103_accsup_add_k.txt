This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all TC-135S/W ACC units. This Addendum does not apply to Air National Guard
(ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Maintain official records
created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and dispose of records IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at the AF Records Information Management System link on the AF Portal.
Contact supporting records managers as required. Send recommended changes or comments on

Responsibility.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Mission columns
have been changed. Numerous systems Work Unit Codes (WUCs) and notes have been added or
deleted to better clarify mission capability requirements.
1.General.The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems
and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. MESLs are not comprehensive WUC lists and are not intended
to mirror Minimum Equipment Lists. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable

(MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC
OMNIBUS Plan.
1.1.Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded
mission systems.
1.2.Aircraft status for generation and deployment. The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A
Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be
configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
1.3.All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify
the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
1.4.Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC against the
FSL and all applicable Basic System Lists (BSLs) across the page. For any WUC not listed, the
higher assembly WUC will be used. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement
determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned
aircraft; therefore, it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are
applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft
would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC
statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only
the FSL and TNG columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report
status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure
status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment
code.

29
            verified prior to takeoff.
            Tank quantities must be manually entered in malfunctioning tank to get
30
            accurate gross weight and CG.
31          Must have two operational to be PMC.
32          Must have analog or digital.

35          Sufficient to maintain cabin altitude below 12,000 feet.
            Required only if operating via manual cabin pressure control. Gauge is not
36          required if the cabin pressure warning function of the Altitude Alerter is
            operational.
37          Roll, pitch and altitude hold required.
38          PMC as long as AN/ASN-121 provides attitude reference for autopilot system.
