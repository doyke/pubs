This 482d Fighter Wing Instruction (482 FWI) incorporates procedures from Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Air Force Reserve Command Supplement 1 (AFRC Sup1), Aircraft
and Equipment Maintenance Management. It assigns responsibilities, directs action and
prescribes procedures to control tools, equipment, and electronic devices from all wing agencies
dispatching to aircraft parking/runway/taxi areas and aircraft maintenance areas within the 482d
Fighter Wing (482 FW) and its subordinate functions. It establishes responsibilities, standardized
procedures and locations for the 482d Maintenance Group (482 MXG). Commanders and
supervisors are responsible for ensuring personnel comply with the provisions of this instruction.
It applies to all personnel assigned to the 482 FW. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force Form 847
(AF Form 847), Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847 from the field

1. Composite Tool Kit (CTK) Security, Control, and Accountability.
     1.1. Security:
        1.1.1. Dispatched CTK's are inventoried and locked when left unattended. Tools shall be
        placed back in the appropriate inlays when unattended or when the job is complete.
            1.1.1.1. Small items, equipment items and non-combustible Petroleum, Oil,
            Lubricants (POL) that present a Foreign Object (FO) hazard and can fit inside the
            CTK shall be stored in the CTK when left unattended.
            1.1.1.2. Large items such as the fuel wrap around hose, tire jack cart or large tools
            that do not fit inside the CTK shall be placed neatly next to or on top of the CTK.
            Items that are capable of being locked shall be locked.
            1.1.1.3. Large oversize equipment and combustible POL can also be stored on a roll
            around carts. However, the cart must be secured to an aircraft grounding point with a
            lanyard and lock when left unattended on the flight line unless the cart has brakes.
            1.1.1.4. In all cases, the above equipment shall be turned in no later than the end of
            the shift.
            1.1.1.5. Aircraft test equipment that is connected to the aircraft can be left connected.
            However, it must be written up in the aircraft forms. Furthermore, any open lines or
            connectors must have suitable protective devices installed. In addition, test equipment
            must not be left connected unattended overnight unless approved by the MXG/CC.
            1.1.1.6. Personnel are permitted to leave their COMM cord and head set connected to
            the aircraft unattended, if the aircraft is scheduled to fly within the next thirty
            minutes. Otherwise, the equipment will be stored in the CTK.
        1.1.2. In-shop CTK’s must remain locked when not in use unless they are stored in a
        location that is constantly manned or secured. When a work center is not large enough to
        facilitate a manned tool room, the shop supervisor is responsible for an itemized
        inventory of all tools and equipment at the beginning and end of each shift.
     1.2. Control: Store CTK’s, tools, and equipment in a designated location for positive control
     and ease of inventory. Personnel are responsible for control of the CTK and equipment they
     sign out.
        1.2.1. Wing agencies shall control tools, equipment and electronic devices that are
        dispatched to 482FW aircraft parking/runway/taxi areas and aircraft maintenance areas
        IAW AFI 21-101, AFRC SUP and this instruction.
     1.3. Accountability:
        1.3.1. All 482 MXG maintenance areas that use CTK’s/Equipment on the 482 FW flight
        line or maintain related parts/equipment shall use the Tool Control Accountability
        System (TC-MAX) tool accountability system.
            1.3.1.1. Deleted.
        1.3.2. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) sections shall follow CTK guidance given in
        AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment Program.
482FWI21-105 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    3
