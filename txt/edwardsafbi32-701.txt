TW/CEOHP) which is responsible for lakebed runway maintenance. This Instruction describes
general procedures for lakebed runway maintenance consistent with 412th Test Wing and
Airfield Management requirements. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm/. Additionally, if the publication
generates a report(s), alert readers in a statement and cite all applicable Reports Control Numbers

1. Safety. The 412 TW/CEOHP will adhere to safety and environmental instructions in
accordance with Airfield Management requirements and as prescribed in Air Force Policy
Directive 32-70, Environmental Quality and Air Force Instruction 91-203, Air Force
consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction. All personnel involved in lakebed runway
maintenance will familiarize themselves with the procedures as outlined.

2. Policy. Maintenance procedures for dry lakebed runways are prioritized by the
412th Test Wing consistent with test requirements and managed by 412 OSS/OSAM, Airfield
Management. Airfield Management will initiate lakebed runway maintenance requests through
the 412th Test Wing Civil Engineer Division Operations Branch, Chief, Heavy Repair
(412 TW/CEOH). The 412 TW/CEOH will notify the 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor, to mobilize
a lakebed runway maintenance crew to accomplish required maintenance. The 412 TW/CEOHP
will maintain dry lakebed runways for routine flight test requirements and emergency landings.
3. Dry Lakebed Runway Maintenance.
     3.1. The 412 TW/CEOH ensures 412 TW/CEOHP comply with instructions as outlined.
     The 412 TW/CEOHP dry lakebed runway maintenance crew is designated on a roster posted
     in the shop area by the 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor. The Supervisor is responsible for
     keeping the roster up-to-date. Lakebed runway maintenance will commence as follows:
        3.1.1. Airfield Management will initiate repair actions with 412 TW/CEOH or the 412
        TW/CEOHP Supervisor.
        3.1.2. The 412 TW/CEOH will notify the 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor to begin the
        required runway maintenance.
        3.1.3. The 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor will notify the dry lakebed runway maintenance
        crew to begin required maintenance.
        3.1.4. The dry lakebed runway maintenance crew will order marking oil for the lakebed
        runways and coordinate the delivery schedule in consultation with the 412 TW/CEOH
        and Airfield Management.
        3.1.5. Airfield Management will direct contracted support for the oil application.
        Airfield Management will specify the work to be performed and supervise contractor
        performance.
        3.1.6. 412 TW/CEOHP will provide a person and a vehicle to assist with runway
        marking application. Lakebed runway repairs and marking are weather dependent and
        could commence in the spring (April - May) or as late as summer (June - July). Twenty
        tons of oil is considered the typical load quantity, which is purchased by 412
        TW/CEOHP through a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).                   Routine summer
        maintenance (June - September) will be conducted to maintain runway surfaces. Work is
        not normally performed during winter (December - March) months. NOTE: The
        months specified are approximate and will vary due to annual precipitation.
4. Dry Lakebed Runway Oil Marking Procedures.
     4.1. The 412 OG/CC will prioritize which lakebed runways need to be remarked based on
     test and Test Pilot School training requirements. Airfield Management will communicate
     these requirements to the 412 TW/CEOH. Normally, the “Fly-by line” and the following
     lakebed runways are marked annually: 12L/30R, 12R/30L, 15/33, 06/24 North, 05L/23R,
     18R/36L, and 18C/36C (see Attachment 2).
        4.1.1. The 412 TW/CEOHP maintains the lakebed runways in-house. Runway surfaces
        include the area between the edge lines and approximately 10 feet outside the oil
        demarcation. Edge lines will be repaired prior to oil application.
EDWARDS AFBI 32-701 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                           3


      4.1.2. Marking the lakebed runways with oil is a contracted effort. 412 TW/CEOHP
      does not have the equipment to apply markings.
      4.1.3. There are approximately 136 miles of lakebed markings to be maintained. One
      load of oil marks approximately six miles of runway markings.
      4.1.4. Maintenance start and completion dates are approximate and subject to weather,
      existing lakebed conditions, and operational use.
5. Dry Lakebed Maintenance Procedures.
   5.1. Lakebed maintenance operations commence in Spring when declared accessible by
   Airfield Management. The lakebed runway maintenance crew will consist of at least four
   pavement personnel. Pavement crews fill holes, fissures and other work as mission
   requirements dictate. There are 17 lakebed runways; 15 on Rodgers Dry Lake and two on
   Rosamond Dry Lake. Typically, 5-10 runways are restored to service annually. A non-
   standard area is defined as any portion outside the designated runway surface. For
   maintenance of a non-standard area, the requesting test program or agency will provide a Job
   Order Number with the request for maintenance.
      5.1.1. Airfield Management will annually or as required by special events or test
      requirements, coordinate with 412 TW/CEOH or the 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor to
      initiate lakebed runway marking. 412 TW/CEOHP will order the oil and coordinate the
      delivery schedule in consultation with Airfield Management.
      5.1.2. Airfield Management will specify the work to be performed and supervise
      contractor performance and oil application.
      5.1.3. The 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor will provide a person and vehicle to assist with
      oil application.
      5.1.4. Airfield Management will request limited summer maintenance (June -
      September) to repair pot holes and fissures. Maintenance work is not performed when
      the lakebeds are closed by Airfield Management.
6. Striping Operations/Coordination with Airfield Maintenance
   6.1. Lakebed runway striping normally begins in Spring (April - May).
      6.1.1. Airfield Management will contact 412 TW/CEOH or the 412 TW/CEOHP
      Supervisor prior to oil striping to request assistance to fill holes, fissures, compact and
      perform other work to return the runways surface to mission capable status.
      6.1.2. The 412 TW/CEOH will notify the 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor to begin striping
      procedures.      The 412 TW/CEOHP Supervisor will notify the lakebed runway
      maintenance crew of the tasking to recondition the lakebeds to mission capable status.
      The maintenance crew of four (see Table 6.1.2.), supplemented by a half-time work
      leader, will fill holes, fissures, compact and accomplish any other work required. This
      work normally requires 100-150 man/hours per runway.

             NOTE: The landplane use must be pre-coordinated with Airfield
             Management. It is not used for routine maintenance.
     6.2. Summer (June - September) maintenance will be conducted to repair pot holes and
     fissures to maintain the integrity and safety of the runway surface when tasked by Airfield
     Management. Routine repairs may require all or part of the equipment listed in Table 7.1.2.
     Work is not normally performed during winter (December - March) months.
