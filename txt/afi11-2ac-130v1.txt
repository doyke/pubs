     an evaluation or certifying the student in a maneuever or procedure.
     1.3.10.5. Each instructor aircrew member is responsible for the safe execution of the
     duties of their respective crew position. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or
     proficiency of the student should raise a question in the instructor‘s mind as to the
     student‘s ability to safely execute the duties of the aircrew position, the instructor will
     immediately take over these duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate
     the proper method of executing these duties. In order to provide effective instruction
     concerning weapons system employment, instructors must be thoroughly knowledgeable
     in AC-130 TTPs, governing AFIs, regulatory guidance, and other materials such as
     applicable manufacturers‘ publications.
     1.3.10.6. Instructor pilots are responsible at all times for the conduct of the flight and
     safety of the aircraft. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or proficiency of the
     student at the controls raises a question in the instructor pilot‘s mind as to the student‘s
     ability to safely complete a prescribed maneuver, the instructor pilot will immediately
     take over the controls of the aircraft. The instructor pilot should then explain and
     demonstrate proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming
     control of the aircraft. All instructors will place special emphasis on the procedures for
     positive identification of emergency conditions before initiating corrective action. In
     addition, instructors will place a high emphasis on the procedures for positive exchange
     of control; these procedures will be thoroughly briefed.
     1.3.10.7. Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their instructional abilities may be
     used in their primary crew position (provided a deficiency does not involve primary crew
     duties). Commanders will take the necessary action to either retrain or remove those
     individuals from instructor status IAW Air Force or MAJCOM directives.
     1.3.10.8. Individuals designated for instructor duty are authorized to instruct at all levels
     of qualification. Instructors are authorized to teach any event in which they are qualified
     and current unless specifically restricted.

       1.3.11.4. Participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified,
       current, and adequately prepared.
1.4. Aircrew Training Policy. The primary training method for AC-130 initial qualification or
upgrade training is attendance at an ETCA formal school. USAF policy dictates the use of
formal schools unless attendance is impractical. The secondary method is in-unit training using
applicable formal school courseware. Requalification training will be accomplished IAW AFI
11-202 vol. 1
   1.4.1. Secondary Method Training (SMT). Secondary Method Training (SMT) requires a
   waiver be submitted through appropriate channels per this instruction and approved by
   MAJCOM/A3T. Any aircrew member who was previously disenrolled from a formal ETCA
   course for substandard performance is ineligible for Secondary Method Training. Aircrew
   members (primary or supervisory) must complete SMT within 180 calendar days from the
   date of their first ground training session or first flight, whichever occurs first. Individuals
   will start training within 45 calendar days of waiver approval. Individuals unable to
   complete training within these limits may continue training; however, their units will notify
   AFSOC/A3T with a description of the difficulty and expected completion date (not to exceed
   an additional 120 calendar days). If SMT is not completed by this date, any further extension
   requires AFSOC/A3T approval. Commanders will ensure aircrew personnel engaged in
   qualification or requalification training complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted
   manner. Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should be
   minimized. Upon completion of SMT training, units will notify AFSOC/A3T using the SMT
   Completion Memo.   SMT Waiver and SMT Completion templates are available on the
   AFSOC/A3TA Sharepoint website, https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TA/default.aspx.
       1.4.1.1. Formal School courseware requests. 19/551 SOS are the primary sources for
       formal training products. When specific formal courseware is not published, use of
       locally developed training syllabi is authorized. Units will forward all locally developed
       syllabi for in-unit training to AFSOC/A3T for review and approval. All locally
       approved in-unit syllabi are posted on the AFSOC/A3T web page. For SMT requests,
       the waiver authority (per Table 1.1) will include the appropriate formal school (19/551
       SOS) as an addressee on all correspondence and will request that the formal school
       forward applicable courseware to the aircrew member‘s unit of assignment. Courseware
       includes but is not limited to; the course syllaus, briefings, Computer Based Training
       (CBT) modules, student and instructor guides, and training guides and grade sheets for
       the student‘s training folder. The unit training office will verify the current version is
       used. (Note: Formal schools will not forward written examinations as part of the
       courseware for in-unit qualification training).
       1.4.1.2. Complete all academic, ground, and flight training outlined in the courseware.
       When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the training is
       incompatible with local training conditions (e.g. simulator not available). Students may
       proficiency advance (PA) provided all required proficiency levels (RPLs) are met or
       exceeded for the advanced (skipped) sortie(s)/lesson(s). The SQ/DO is the approval
       authority for proficiency advancement.
          1.4.1.2.1. Syllabus Waivers. A syllabus waiver is a planned one-time exception to
          the syllabus used to enhance or accommodate student training in special or unusual
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                13


        circumstances. Syllabus waivers are not intended to be permanent changes to a
        syllabus, but should be suggested as syllabus changes if a permanent change is
        warranted. AFSOC/A3T is the approval authority for syllabus waivers. Submit
        syllabus waiver requests in writing, including the rationale for the waiver using a
        memorandum for record. All waiver requests will be routed through SOG/CC, who
        will forward to AFSOC/A3T. AFSOC/A3T will approve or disapprove requests and
        forward a copy of approved waivers to SOG/CC and the appropriate gaining unit
        training office. SOGs will maintain a record of all approved waivers for two years.
        Training requested in a syllabus waiver will not commence until waiver approval is
        obtained.
        1.4.1.2.2. Syllabus Deviations. A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from
        syllabus or equivalent directed requirement such as prerequisite flow, turn times,
        landing currency, minimum number of events, etc. Unless a waiver request is
        approved prior to beginning of training, all syllabus training must be accomplished.
        If unforeseen circumstances result in an omission of required training, the SQ/DO
        will determine if the omitted training can be accomplished later in the syllabus flow,
        without adversely affecting the quality of student training. Document all syllabus
        deviations, SQ/DO directed corrective actions, and accomplishment of the omitted
        training in the student‘s training folder. However, on a case-by-case basis the SQ/DO
        may authorize an intentional syllabus deviation in the interest of flying safety. All
        syllabus deviations will be documented and maintained in the student training folder.
     1.4.1.3. . MAJCOM approved differences training may be conducted in unit without a
     waiver.
     1.4.1.4. Units conducting training where a waiver is not required (i.e., complete training
     for restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, MAJCOM approved
     differences training) will send a request for any applicable courseware through channels
     to MAJCOM/A3T, with an information copy to the appropriate formal school. Include
     unit point of contact (name, rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the name
     and rank of the individual who will receive the training.
  1.4.2. Training Forms. Aircrew training records and forms will be established and
  maintained per AFI 11-202 V1 AFSOC Supplement.
     1.4.2.1. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, or AF Form 1381, USAF
     Certification of Air Crew Training, will be used to document ground/flying training
     associated with mission qualification, and to document instructor certified and one-
     time/initial flying training events. The AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 is maintained in
     the individual‘s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) per AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, Aircrew
     Standardization/Evaluation Program.
     1.4.2.2. The following forms aid management of aircrew training programs.
        1.4.2.2.1. AF Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, is used as the
        training record jacket to document in-unit qualification or upgrade of an aircrew
        member. It documents applicable ground training, special function training, part task
        training, cockpit procedures training, simulator training, and flying training
        accomplished by crewmembers.
 14                                                        AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012


          1.4.2.2.2. AF Form 4110, Comments –SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to
          document narrative comments on aircrew training activities.
          1.4.2.2.3. AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to list RPL, indicate
          events for training sortie completion, and to document demonstrated student task and
          subtask performance and knowledge proficiency levels. Units are authorized to
          overprint and reproduce AF Form 4111 for approved course syllabi. The number of
          training tasks in the appropriate training guide is a recommended minimum, which
          normally allows the student to achieve proficiency. It is neither intended to restrict
          the number of times the task must be accomplished nor restrict proficiency
          advancement.
       1.4.2.3. IAW the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP), personnel in Air
       Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1AXXX are exempt from maintaining OJT Training
       Folders (AF Form 623).
       1.4.2.4. For Weapons Instructor Course (WIC), prepare training records IAW USAFWS
       guidance.
   1.4.3. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is ―duty not involving
   flying‖ (DNIF) may log ground training events, including simulator training, if their physical
   condition allows.      Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042, Medical
   Recommendation For Flying or Special Operational Duty, action if the DNIF status includes
   ground training limitations.
   1.4.4. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, the unit commander determines
   the level of supervision necessary to accomplish required training. If the mission objectives
   include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an
   instructor may be required. The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor
   from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties.
       1.4.4.1. Non-current crewmembers.
       1.4.4.2. Crewmembers in initial, difference, upgrade, or requalification flying training.
       1.4.4.3. Senior officers who have not completed initial qualification as outlined in
       Chapter 2 and as outlined in paragraph 1.7.
   1.4.5. Cross Crew Position Training (CCPT). With unit commander, operations officer, or
   mission commander approval, instructors from one crew position may train crewmembers
   from a different crew position on specific skills/events in which both are qualified (as long as
   the instructor is not performing duties as a primary crewmember at the time) unless otherwise
   restricted in this volume. Flight evaluations must comply with requirements of AFI 11-2AC-
   130, Vol. 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
1.5. Service Commitments. Formal training, either primary or secondary method, conducted
per this instruction may incur a service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
Commitments (ADSC). Reference the appropriate AFI for program specifics. Individuals will
acknowledge the incurred SC by signing the appropriate Active Duty Service Commitment
Acknowledgement Statement, prior to entering training. The unit training officer will notify
AFPC/DPSFO via the servicing Military Personnel Flight (MPF) once training is complete.
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                          15


1.6. Waivers: AF/A3O is the waiver authority for training requirements specified in AFI 11-
202, Vol. 1. This authority has been delegated to MAJCOM/A3 for specific aircrew training
events (case by case basis). These requirements currently include initial CRM training, initial
life support equipment and procedures training, Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE),
flight evaluations, and egress training (see AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 for specific guidance). For case-
by-case individual waivers for flight physical and physiological training currencies,
AFSOC/SGP and AFMSA/SGPA are the respective waiver authorities. Some ground training
items (e.g. small arms training, LOAC, etc.) are tasked by other agencies. Reference the source
instruction to determine the waiver authority in these cases. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver
authority for MDS-specific Vol. 1 aircrew training requirements IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, unless

   training start date, expected upgrade or qualification date, date last event accomplished,
   remarks, justification for the waiver request and requesting unit point of contact (include
   name, rank, telephone number, and office symbol). Waiver format templates are available on
   the AFSOC/A3TA Sharepoint website, https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TA/default.aspx.
   1.6.3. Units requesting waivers for SMT in-unit qualification, mission qualification, or
   upgrade of an aircrew member will send requests through appropriate channels to
   MAJCOM/A3T. Formal schools will forward current copies of courseware materials to units
   semi-annually. Maintain copies of all waivers in the individual‘s training folder. If the
   training incurs an ADSC per paragraph 1.5., include the statement ―Individual acknowledged
   receipt of ADSC by signing the AF Form 63, Acitve Duty Service Commitment
   Acknowledgement Statement, on (date AF Form 63 signed)‖.
   1.6.4. Operations Group commander or equivalent (e.g. CJSOAC/CC) may:
       1.6.4.1. Waive 10 percent of the Total and PAA hours in Tables 5.1. and 5.2. required
       for upgrade in all crew positions, on an individual basis only. A copy of the waiver must
       be filed in the individual‘s training record. Students attending formal school will bring a
       waiver letter to the formal school for insertion into their training record.
       1.6.4.2. Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 2 months for Note 1 events
       in the RTM ground training table on an individual basis only (Exception: Events
       referenced in paragraph 1.6. levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless
       specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI). These events may count towards the
       next periodic requirements (units should note on waiver when events were accomplished
       and the ARMS due date should be updated).
       1.6.4.3. Extend due dates for RTM ground training table events on an individual basis
       for the duration of an exercise, contingency or operational mission only if a crewmember
       goes overdue while away from home station and the training is not available at the
       deployed location. Exception: Events referenced in paragraph 1.6. levied by other AFIs
       may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI.
       1.6.4.4. Waive all flying training requirements (RTM BAQ and MR tables except as
       otherwise noted) on an individual basis only. Wings/groups must keep an accurate record
       of waivers granted. Notify MAJCOM/A3T when waivers are issued.
   1.6.5. Unit commanders may carry new crewmembers as ―mission ready‖ (MR) for up to six
   months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a PCS or formal school and is not MR
   in all core mission events. Units must notify MAJCOM/A3T of any OG extensions. Under
   no circumstance will aircrew perform events in which they are not qualified unless under the
   direct supervision of an instructor. This policy does not apply to basic aircraft qualification
   events. If training is not complete in six months, the aircrew member becomes ―non-mission
   ready‖ (NMR). Squadrons will have six months from the time a new core mission event is
   added and MAJCOM guidance issued to train and qualify aircrew in the new event.
1.7. Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, AFSOC
Supplement.
1.8. Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews. For intra-command transfer
of aircrew members, the gaining organization will honor validated training completed by newly
assigned crewmembers prior to the transfer. For inter-command transfer, certifications and
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                    17


qualifications should be accepted to the maximum extent practical, as long as training and
evaluation standards are equivalent. The operations officer at the gaining unit should review the
individual's career training folder and flight evaluation folder to determine which certifications
and qualifications will be honored.
   1.8.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Screening. Losing units will screen individual
   flight and ground training records during unit out-processing. Accomplish this screening in
   sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS. Losing unit will provide a printed copy
   of current ground and flying training summaries to individuals prior to PCS. See AFI 11-
   401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance.
   1.8.2. Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining
   unit commander.
1.9. Initial Cadre for Change of Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,
qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre. In some
instances, it will be necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to form an
initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements may be
waived. Authorization to form initial cadre crews will be contained in the conversion program
action directive. Unless otherwise stated in the program action directive, the following
conditions will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification for aircraft conversion:
   1.9.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to
   begin aircrew training. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than
   currently held; for example, AC-130U IP to AC-130J flight examiner.
   1.9.2. Units send proposed initial cadre list by name, rank, current crew position and aircraft,
   total flying time, and requested crew qualification level through channels to MAJCOM/A3
   for approval.
   1.9.3. Initial cadre is not required for minor aircraft modifications when any required
   training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished
   in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on a letter of Xs
   or Memo for Record (MFR). Crewmembers will not fly with new equipment until trained.
1.10. Unit Aircrew Capability. Squadrons will maintain mission ready status on all primary
aircrew members up to unit authorizations (N/A for USAFWS instructor aircrew members).
Commanders will train aircrews to meet capabilities specified in unit DOC statements.
Supervisory aircrew and staff members assigned above squadron level, which are in excess of
the unit‘s mission requirements, will maintain mission ready, basic mission capable, or basic
aircraft qualification status, as required. Note: To change from BMC to MR status, a
crewmember will begin maintaining full MR flying currency. The unit commander may assign
additional training, as desired.
   1.10.1. Commanders will not assign additional duties to first assignment ―pipeline‖ (directly
   out of formal MDS training) crewmembers (officer and enlisted) for their first 6 months in
   the unit. First assignment crewmembers in any AFSOC weapon system should not be given
   an additional duty for the first 6 months in the unit. This policy allows pipeline students to
   learn the weapon system without distraction of an additional duty; all other personnel may be
   assigned additional duties.
 18                                                      AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012


   1.10.2. Aircrew members will not perform long term duties which detract from the primary
   duties of training for, or performing the unit flying mission.
   1.10.3. ACC Currency Requirements. Permanent Party aircrew assigned to the 14 WPS
   USAFWS instructors must maintain at least basic mission capable flying currency in the
   portions of the mission they will instruct. Unit commanders may direct specific individuals
   to maintain only partial BMC qualifications. In such cases, the crewmember will require
   only those currency items associated with this tailored qualification. The individual‘s AF
   Form 8 will indicate applicable restrictions based on assignments of less than full mission
   qualification. If 14 WPS crewmembers augment operational units, the gaining unit
   commander must be provided a detailed list of the individual‘s current training status. The
   individual must comply with MR training requirements of the gaining unit or pursue
   applicable waivers through the operational unit‘s MAJCOM/A3. The gaining unit or
   MAJCOM may levy additional requirements as desired. Chapter 4 outlines exceptions to
   continuation currency training requirements for these personnel. Note: For the purposes of
   this instruction, enlisted aircrew members assigned to the 14 WPS are not considered
   USAFWS instructors.
1.11. RAP Tasking Memorandum (RTM). MAJCOM/A3 will determine training
requirements for subordinate units. Due to dynamic requirements of Combatant Commanders,
training requirements and currencies may be altered regularly. These training requirement and
currency adjustments may be made via RTM. AFSOC/A3 will be an info addressee on all
changes.
1.12. Deviations. This instruction does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or any
other Air Force Instruction. Flight safety will be given prime consideration and must take
precedence over the requirements and guidance of this instruction.
1.13. Publication Administration. This instruction is distributed to AFSOC, AFSOC-gained
units, and AFSOC related schools based on requirements established through the Publications
Distribution Office (PDO). All aircrew members are authorized this instruction. Distribution to
units, organizations, and individuals outside these commands or not associated with the MDS
may be made upon specific request and justification.
   1.13.1. Supplements. Forward all unit or MAJCOM supplements to this instruction to
   AFSOC/A3TA, who in turn will forward to AF/A3O-AI for approval.                     Provide
   AFSOC/A3TA, and applicable MAJCOM/A3T a copy of all approved supplements. If
   required by mission or location, units may supplement this instruction by coordinating with
   AFSOC/A3T before publication.

                                            Chapter 2

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the minimum requirements for Basic Aircraft
Qualification (BAQ) training which may be completed as part of initial qualification,
requalification, conversion, or differences training. Duties not directly related to qualification or
requalification training should be kept to a minimum.
   2.1.1. Qualification training provides the training necessary to initially qualify crewmembers
   in a basic crew position and flying duties. Upon completion of qualification training, the
   crewmember attains BAQ status. BAQ is a prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training
   (MQT, outlined in Chapter 3).
2.2. General Requirements. The primary method of initial qualification and requalification
training is the appropriate formal training course listed in ETCA. If no requalification course
exists, conduct requalification using the initial qualification course. Completing the appropriate
formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. When attendance is not
practical or quotas are not available, units may request secondary method in-unit qualification
training waivers IAW paragraph 1.4.1. Any aircrew member who has previously failed to
successfully complete the ETCA formal course for substandard performance will not be issued a
secondary method training waiver.
2.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction. The formal school Syllabus of
Instruction (SOI) designates the course prerequisite approval authority.
2.4. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers must complete ground training
requirements IAW Table 2.1, prior to the first flight. See Chapter 4 for event descriptions.

 Note: See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, AFSOC Supplement for Flight Surgeon (FS), Medical
 Technician, and Combat Camera Aerial Photographer Training requirements.
   2.4.1. Written Examination. Open and closed book qualification examinations must be
   completed before the completion of basic qualification flying training. Written examinations
   must satisfy the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol. 2 and MDS Vol. 2. The formal school
   will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for inunit qualifications. When
 20                                                        AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012


   qualification training is completed by secondary method, the student will complete the
   appropriate group stan/eval or equivalent examination IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, para 5.2.7.
   2.4.2. Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection [LL03]. All crewmembers and other
   personnel regularly flying on AFSOC aircraft will receive hands-on egress training in the
   aircraft prior to their first flight. Aircrew members must be given flight deck and cargo
   compartment familiarization. Place emphasis on the location and function of all switches and
   controls required for all emergency procedures. See current AC-130 Ready Aircrew Program
   Tasking Memo (RTM) for further details.
2.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate ETCA formal
course satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   2.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If required by mission
   scheduling or student progress, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   Operations Officer.
   2.5.2. AFSOC policy for C-130 pilot training requires that, prior to certification, ACs and
   IPs will train to a 3C level in simulated 3-engine takeoffs and simulated 2-engine approaches
   and landings. CPs will see a demonstration of a simulated 3-engine takeoff and a
   demonstration of a simulated 2-engine approach and landing prior to flying without an
   instructor. These events may be accomplished in a simulator to satisfy this requirement.
2.6. Basic Aircraft Qualification Conversion/Differences Training. Conversion training is
normally associated with training between MDS (e.g. C-21 to C-130). Difference training is
conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same mission design (e.g. C-130E to
C-130H3). Use difference training when changing between same design aircraft and the amount
of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal qualification course.
Additionally, accomplish difference training when an aircraft is modified and any required
trainng for that modification can easily be accomplished in-unit. BAQ difference training
qualifies an aircrew member to be a basic crewmember. Primary method for differences training
is via completion of a formal school transition course (TX). If a TX course is not available, the
alternate method is via in unit ground and flight training IAW MAJCOM/A3T approved AF
Form 4111, satisfactory completion of the qualification written open/closed examinations, and
instructor certification on the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 for the new aircraft. Aircrew
members entered into differences training will complete training within 180 days after the first
flight of the training program. BAQ Differences training is authorized per Table 2.2.
   2.6.1. For basic aircraft instrument/qualification purposes, the AC-130H, AC-130U, C-
   130E/H, C-130H1/2, C-130H3, EC-130E/H, HC-130P/N, MC-130E, MC-130H, MC-130P,
   and       AC-130W are generally considered to be different series aircraft in the same MDS.
   Training between the C-130J variants and any other C-130 variant is conversion training and
   will be accomplished via a formal course at an FTU or via SMT.
   2.6.2. For puposes of paragraph 2.6. and Table 2.2, C-130 ‗slick‘ variants are C-130E/H, C-
   130H1/2, C-130H3, and demodified EC-130E/H; difference training and AF Form 4348 or
   AF Form 1381 entries are required for each variant.
   2.6.3. Upon completion of differences training and certification on the AF Form 4348 or AF
   Form 1381, the crewmember is Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ) in the new aircraft. Aircrew
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                                   21


                       members may maintain previous C-130 instructor/evaluator, air to air refueling (AAR) and
                       Maximum Effort qualifications at the discretion of the unit commander. Other crew position
                       qualifications (i.e. mission instructor) are attained through the procedures in Chapter 5.
                       2.6.4. Aircrew members training to an MDS not specifically listed in paragraph 2.6 or
                       Table 2.2 must complete conversion training. Conversion training requires the completion
                       of the formal school initial qualification course.
                       2.6.5. Multiple Qualification. Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification or TX
                       course to gain basic aircraft qualification in another MDS unless authorized difference
                       training per paragraph 2.6. For approved secondary method training, request courseware
                       IAW paragraph 1.4.
2.7. C-130E/H Qualification Training. All aircrew members in flying billets will maintain
qualification in the AC-130H/U. Aircrew members will not be solely qualified in the C-130E/H.
Students awaiting AC-130H/U qualification training at the 19/551 SOS are authorized to fly the
C-130E/H providing they are qualified and current (if non-current, under the supervision of an
instructor). All C-130E/H qualified aircrew members will comply with applicable ground
training requirements in the RTM ground training table and flying training requirements in the
RTM BAQ table.

                                            Chapter 3

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
mission qualification and requalification. Aircrew members completing mission qualification or
requalification will meet the requirements of this chapter. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the crewmember will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or
Mission Ready (MR) status.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification is to complete the
appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. Requalification training will be accomplished
IAW AFI 11-202 vol. 1. If required and no formal requalification course exists, conduct
requalification using the initial mission qualification course. When attendance is not practical or
quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct secondary method mission
qualification training IAW paragraph 1.4.1. using formal school courseware. Aircrew members
who have previously failed to complete an ETCA formal course for substandard performance
will not be issued a SMT waiver for the same training. The secondary method requires use of
formal school courseware and a waiver from the appropriate waiver authority as listed in Table
1.1. This courseware establishes the minimum training requirements to meet standards specified
in AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol. 2. Units may s upplement courseware to meet local requirements.
Submit all courseware change requests to AFSOC/A3T prior to implementation.
   3.2.1. Direct Support Operator (DSO) Training.          DSOs will complete appropriate
   qualification/requalification course utilizing AFSOC/AFSOTC approved syllabi and
   courseware. After completing initial mission qualification training and evaluation, AFSOC
   differences/conversion training may be used to attain qualification in different series of
   AFSOC C-130 MDS and vertical lift aircraft. In all instances use AFSOC/A3T approved
   courseware.
   3.2.2. DSOs are tasked to fly on all AFSOC aircraft and will maintain universal qualification
   per AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, AFSOC Supplement. They will comply with AFI 11-2MDS, Vol. 1,
   DSO semi-annual ground and flying training currency requirements for each aircraft in which
   a qualification is held. DSOs will log a minimum of one CMP each semi-annual period per
   AC-130/MC-130/CV-22 regardless of FTL. The FTL requirements will be halved for each
   MDS for DSOs who maintain both a C-130 and vertical-lift qualification.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction. The formal school syllabus
designates the course prerequisite approval authority.
   3.3.1. This does not preclude simultaneous basic qualification and mission qualification
   training. Simultaneous/Concurrent Multiple-MDS qualification upgrades will not be
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying
   in the units mission will comply with the initial mission qualification course prerequisites.
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                    23


   3.3.3. For the minimum requirements to be trained as a mission Aircraft Commander, refer
   to Table 5.1. If the requirements of the table are not met, train and evaluate the individual as
   a mission CP unless excepted below.
       3.3.3.1. Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP, e.g. FAIP, OSA, etc). PQP pilots will fly in-unit as
       a MC until they have the required PAA flight time. Units will follow requalification
       procedures in Chapter 4 to requal those pilots as MPs.
       3.3.3.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) pilots. MPD pilots will complete AFSOC
       mission qualification in the right seat.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all ground training in Table 3.1 as part of
mission qualification training or prior to certifying individuals as mission ready. Completion of
training will establish due dates for recurring ground training required in Chapter 4. Credit any
training accomplished at a formal school. Qualified mission ready crewmembers transferred
from other units require only unit specific mission ready training events or events which are
due/overdue.
   3.4.1. Academic Training. Complete all academic and ground training delineated in
   applicable courseware. If not included in the course syllabus, accomplish the minimum
   requirements listed in AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 seperately.
   3.4.2. Written Examination. Crewmembers must complete a written examination before the
   end of mission qualification flying training. Formal school End of Course examinations,
   Group stan/eval or equivalent examinations for SMT satisfy this requirement. The formal
   school will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for inunit qualifications.

  Combat Camera Aerial Photographer Training requirements.
  1. Not required for formal school aircrew instructors. If formal school instructors are
  deployed for contingency or exercise augmentation, these events must be completed prior to
  deployment.
  2. Training Status Item. Crewmembers will fly with an instructor until this event is
  accomplished.
  3. Required within 90 days of arrival at new unit.
  4. Grounding Item. Crewmembers must complete training prior to first flight.
3.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate ETCA formal
course satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   3.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   operations officer.
   3.5.2. There should be minimum time lapse between training missions, and every effort
   should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed
   time period.
   3.5.3. Crewmember requirements may be completed on training or operational missions
   under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position. Comply with restrictions
   in AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol. 3.
3.6. Specific Mission Training Requirements. AC-130 navigators and fire control officers
(FCO) will have 500 hours AC-130H/U time and maintain at least an instructor qualification
prior to entering dual navigator/ FCO mission qualification training.
3.7. Mission Difference Training Requirements. When mission ready (MR) or basic mission
capable (BMC) crewmembers complete differences qualification training to a unit assigned
aircraft to be used in their current mission or to a C-130 having the same mission (i.e., AC-130H
to AC-130U), they may be considered MR or BMC in the new aircraft. If the new aircraft has a
different mission or aircraft differences warrant, additional mission qualification training is
required. The primary method for accomplishing this training is to attend the formal school
transition course (TX). If a formal school course does not exist and as authorized below,
crewmembers may accomplish this training inunit by completing MAJCOM/A3T approved AF
Form 4111, mission open/closed book examinations, and a flight evaluation.
   3.7.1. Crewmembers qualified and current in special mission events may maintain that
   qualification, once they are mission qualified in their new aircraft.
   3.7.2. Crewmembers will complete all required ground training prior to being declared
   mission ready.
   3.7.3. The only crew positions authorized for in-unit difference training for mission
   qualification are loadmasters, aerial gunners, DSOs, flight engineers, and sensor operators.
   Accomplish in-unit difference training for aircrew members by completing the AF Form

                                            Chapter 4

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements.
   4.1.1. Requirements in this chapter satisfy the minimum flying and related ground training to
   maintain currency. Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events. Failure to
   accomplish these continuation training requirements will not affect BMC or MR status but
   may entail additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. If any sortie or event in this
   chapter is included in the RTM, it becomes a requirement for BAQ, BMC, and MR status.
   The RTM contains all ground training and flying requirements tables and definitions.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same
   flight.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Training events accomplished on a flight evaluation or during a sortie in which the
   aircrew member attains an instructor certification may be credited toward the individual‘s
   volume requirements.
   4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
   currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training. Certification events trained
   to a 3C in the FTU will use the date of the flight evaluation as the initial accomplishment
   date.
   4.1.6. Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in an ATD as noted in the
   RTM BAQ and MR flying requirements tables. The RTM is available on the AFSOC/A3TA
   Sharepoint website, https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/_layouts/shorturl.aspx?id=b4f93f38fdf1.
4.2. Training Levels (TL). The use of experienced based FTLs and Ground Training Levels
(GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources. Aircrew members must
meet the minimum criteria established in paragraph 4.2.1 and Table 4.1 before assignment to
the respective training level. When these minimums are met, awarding a training level is at the
sole discretion of the squadron commander. Note: The aircrew member‘s availability to fly
should not be a factor in assigning a TL.
   4.2.1. FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time (total C-130 time
   for DSOs) and total time per Table 4.1. For basic qualification FTL, PAA time will include
   flight and sim time in any variant of C-130. For mission qualification FTL, PAA time will
   include any type C-130 time and any AC-130 WST time.
       4.2.1.1. FTL ―A‖-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.2. FTL ―B‖-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.3. FTL ―C‖-Inexperienced BAQ and MR aircrew members (All Copilots).
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                   27

  Note: Special Missions Aviation crewmembers will adhere to Aerial
  Gunner FTL Hour Requirements.
   4.2.2. Crewmembers may be assigned different FTLs for basic and mission qualifications
   and individual events. For example, an aircraft commander coming from EC-130s might be
   assigned basic FTL ―A‖, mission FTL ―C‖ with a caveat of FTL ―A‖ for AAR.
   4.2.3. Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
   level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.
   4.2.4. GTLs are based upon operational flying experience.
       4.2.4.1. GTL ―1‖ – Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying.
       4.2.4.2. GTL ―2‖ – Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying.
4.3. Proration of Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, AFSOC Supplement.
Prorate aircrew member flying training requirements for individuals following completion of
basic qualification, mission qualification, requalification, and upgrades to a new special mission
qualification, or who are not available for flying duties due to PCS, non-flying TDY, DNIF,
emergency leave, or other unavoidable circumstances which prevent the individual from flying.
Only prorate to zero requirements (No Requirements) for the period of 166 days to 6 months in
cases of qualification, requalification, or upgrade. Aircrew members who enter training after the
start of the training period may be prorated. Prorate individual requirements based on the
number of full calendar months left in the training period. Use Table 4.2 to determine the
number of sorties and events required for an individual after proration.

4.4. Recurrency and Requalification Training. Required when an aircrew member does not
meet a currency requirement in this instruction. An aircrew member will not perform events
unsupervised until training has been accomplished.4.4.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to
accomplish events listed in RTM training tables results in a loss of currency for that event.
Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires.
            4.4.1.1. Loss of currency in any RTM BAQ table event results in loss of basic aircraft
            currency. These individuals will fly under the supervision of an instructor or flight
            examiner on all sorties until recurrent. (Exeptions: FPs that lose left seat landing
            currency may fly in the right seat without an instructor).
               4.4.1.1.1. Crewmembers who maintain qualification in their primary aircraft and a C-
               130 variant may satisfy RTM BAQ table currency requirements in either their
               primary aircraft or the C-130. If basic semiannual currency is lost (failure to
               complete the requirements of RTM BAQ table), it is lost for both aircraft. Lost basic
               semiannual currency may be regained in either aircraft. Crewmembers must
               complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 semiannually. Failure to
               complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 results in lost currency
               in the C-130 only and currency must be regained in the C-130.
            4.4.1.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. Crewmembers non-current in designated
            BAQ events (RTM BAQ table, note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of
            BAQ. Crewmembers non-current in designated mission events (RTM MR table, note 1
            events) in excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification.
   4.4.2. Regaining Currency.
            4.4.2.1. Only RTM BAQ and MR tables, note 1 events require an evaluation
            (unqualified) if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202, Vol. 1.). Other
            events require showing proficiency to an instructor in the aircraft or simulator to regain
            currency. If loss of currency exceeds 24 months in non-note 1 events, additional training
            will consist of ground and flight training as directed by the unit commander (training
            folder must be opened). A FE may regain currency for NVG landings under the
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                 29


       supervision of an NVG landing qualified IP as long as that IP is not performing any other
       instructor duties at the time.
       4.4.2.2. Aircrew non-current in special mission events which only require an instructor
       certification (Table 5.3) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an
       instructor.
   4.4.3. Requalification Training. Crewmembers requiring requalification will accomplish
   training IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, and Chapters 2, 3,
   and 5 of this instruction.
4.5. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the RTM ground training
table. Crew members will comply with the time periods listed for their FTL/GTL. Conduct
training IAW the referenced publications, notes in RTM ground training table and the guidance
below. The governing directive or RTM takes precedence over Chapter 4 requirements. If the
AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol. 1, is also listed as a governing directive, the most restrictive guidance
should be followed.
   4.5.1. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.         Make-up training should be
   accomplished at the earliest opportunity. The following apply when crewmembers exceed
   due dates for events in the RTM ground training table.

       4.6.1.4. MP qualified PQPs awaiting AC certification may complete Basic Qualification
       events (RTM BAQ table) in either seat. Emphasis should be on left seat flying. Local
       Proficiency Sorties will be flown in the left seat. PQPs may fly in the left seat for airland
       missions when an aircraft commander who has a minimum of 100 hours since
       certification occupies the right seat. Mission events may be completed while performing
       copilot duties in the right seat or in the left seat when an aircraft commander with 100
       hours since certification occupies the right seat. AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol. 3 further defines
       takeoff and landing policy.
       4.6.1.5. MPD pilots may maintain left seat qualification at the discretion of the squadron
       commander.
       4.6.1.6. Instructors and flight examiners may not log events performed by other
       crewmembers during instruction or evaluations.
   4.6.2. Flying Training Events. See current AC-130 Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memo
   (RTM) for Flying Training Event definitions and requirements.
4.7. Multiple Qualifications. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, AFSOC Supplement.
4.8. Chemical Defense Task Qualifcation Training (CDTQT). The purpose of CDTQT is to
reinforce the crewmember's awareness of limitations and demonstrate physiological effects while
wearing the aircrew chemical defense ensemble (ACDE). The complications of heat exhaustion,
fatigue, hyperventilation, limited dexterity, and hampered communication can all be experienced
during CDTQT. All aircrew members must complete initial aircrew life support chemical
defense training prior to accomplishing initial CDTQT. Complete initial disaster preparedness
training for the ground ensemble prior to CDTQT if the ground ensemble is used. Initial
CDTQT should be done in the aircraft and also done in the aircraft at least every four years. If
initial CDTQT is done in the simulator, the next event must be logged in the aircraft. All other
times the event may be accomplished in the simulator. Accomplishing the event in the aircraft
dual logs normal CDTQT.
   4.8.1. CDTQT Procedures:
       4.8.1.1. Accomplish CDTQT in-flight using the primary unit aircraft. Crewmembers
       will perform primary crew duties while wearing the ACDE. All in-flight profiles must be
       a minimum of 1 hour and accomplished on training missions only. Accomplish CDTQT
       in the simulator using primary unit aircraft WSTs. All simulator profiles must be a
       minimum of 2 hours and flown on full tactical simulation profiles. This should include a
       threat scenario and aircraft emergencies. Flying the simulator profile with the entire crew
       wearing ACDE is highly encouraged.
       4.8.1.2. The entire ACDE need not be used. Normally, wear the filter pack, cotton
       gloves, butyl rubber gloves, Nomex gloves, and the protective hood, along with the CBO
       mask/AERPS and helmet (if applicable). Either the ACDE or ground ensemble may be
       worn during aircraft preflight. Ground ensembles will come from training assets.
       4.8.1.3. When wearing the CBO mask, do not accomplish CDTQT when required to
       wear NVGs. When wearing AERPS, NVG events will be accomplished.
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                31


     4.8.1.4. An observer is required to monitor each crewmember while accomplishing
     CDTQT in-flight. An instructor or flight examiner in each respective crew position, not
     wearing the chemical defense components, will act as the observer for initial CDTQT.
     Exception: An IP not wearing the ensemble and not performing any other instructor
     duties may act as the observer for initial FE training. During recurring CDTQT, if the
     crewmember can be directly observed by another primary crewmember, a dedicated
     observer is not required. The dedicated observer during recurring CDTQT may also wear
     AERPS for all crew positions except pilots (two non-pilot crewmembers wearing AERPS
     may observe one another). Additionally, for safety purposes, one crewmember in the
     back of the aircraft must not be wearing AERPS in case of smoke and fumes.
         4.8.1.4.1. An instructor or flight examiner pilot not wearing the chemical defense
         components will occupy the opposite seat during initial pilot CDTQT. During
         recurring CDTQT, a mission qualified pilot not wearing the chemical defense
         components will act as the observer and occupy the opposite seat. With squadron
         commander approval, both pilots may wear AERPS while occupying the pilot seats
         provided both pilots have accomplished CDTQT within the past 90 days. The
         squadron commander may delegate this authority to the operations officer or mission
         commander.
         4.8.1.4.2. Observers will closely monitor crewmembers actions during CDTQT. If a
         crewmember experiences difficulties such as excessive thermal stress, headaches,
         hyperventilation, nausea, etc., the crewmember will remove the ensemble. The
         observer will notify the AC of any difficulties encountered.
  4.8.2. Mission profile. Crewmembers will accomplish CDTQT during a normal mission
  profile that includes mission crew duties (CAS, live fire, dry fire, air refueling, etc.). In
  addition:
     4.8.2.1. Pilots will accomplish a minimum of one approach and landing. Pilots may
     accomplish CDTQT in either seat.

Terms
Training Device—--A hardware device that permits learning, development, and the practice of
skills and procedures necessary for understanding and operating the integrated systems of a
specific prime mission system.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—-Aircraft assigned to a unit to assist in maintaining
readiness. Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for
the unit.
Basic Aircraft Qualification Aircrew Member—-An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed qualification training in the basic aircrew position and maintains aircraft currency
IAW this instruction.
Basic Mission Capable Aircrew Member—-An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification, and is maintaining 50 percent of the applicable mission
qualification currency requirements of this instruction. Basic mission capable crewmembers
may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit
commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable crewmember to perform
primary crew duties.
Calendar Month—-Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a
30/60 day requirement. For example, an aircrew member could accomplish the event on
1 February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement.
Conversion Training—-Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course. For unit
conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs
will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use
of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre.
Core Mission Events—-A crewmember must be qualified in all core mission events to be
considered Mission Ready (MR) or Mission Capable (MC). To determine how non-currency in
any core mission event affects overall mission currency, refer to the aircraft‘s Mission Ready
Flying Requirements Table (RTM MR table). Loss of qualification in any core mission event
results in loss of overall mission qualification. A core mission event will be considered an
instructor certified event when it is not required to be evaluated on the Initial Mission
 48                                                        AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012


Evaluation. Squadrons will maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR.
AFSOC unit CC/DO will determine the status/qualification of crewmembers in excess of 100
percent manning requirement.
Difference Training—-Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and
the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal
qualification course.
Direct Support Operator (DSO)—-An AFSOC aircrew position responsible for providing
threat warning and enhanced situational awareness to SOF missions utilizing intelligence data
and expertise in the area of operations.
Dual Qualified—-A crewmember who is qualified in more than one crew position in the same
MDS.
Event—-A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction.
Formal School Courseware—--Training materials and programs developed for training aircrew
members at formal schools. It includes all student study guides, workbooks, computer-based
training lessons, instructor guides, and AF Form 4111, Individual Mission Grade Record, related
to the specific course.
Formation Operations—-Accomplish IAW applicable volume(s) of AFSOCI 11-202, AFI 11-
2AC-130, Vol. 3, TO 1-1C-1-20, and TO 1-1C-1-29. AFSOC guidance will never be less
restrictive than the formation definitions found in AFI 11-202, Vol. 3, ―Formation Flight‖,
―Nonstandard Formation‖, and ―Standard Formation‖. Formation operations place all aircraft in
a critical phase of flight which requires constant vigilance, strict discipline, and polished crew
coordination for mission accomplishment. Training will ensure aircrew can think and plan for
multiple aircraft instead of single ship operations.
Infrared Detection System (IDS)—-A passive navigation/sensor system which detects radiant
infrared energy.
Instructor Certified Events—-Training given to an aircrew member that requires an instructor
to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified
in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Form 4111. Instructor certified events are documented in
AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381.
Mission Design and Series (MDS) for Aircraft—-The official designation for aerospace
vehicles used to represent a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and
documentation purposes.
Mission Essential Task List (METL)—-Combat-oriented training requirements. All AFSOC
aircrew training requirements should be in support of unit METLs.
Mission Events—-The squadron Doctrinal (DOC) Statement defines required crew capabilities.
These capabilities/tactics/events can be categorized as either Core or Special Mission.
Mission Oriented Simulator Training—-Training conducted in a WST or MRD that
incorporates a full mission profile. The focus of this training should be crew coordination and
problem solving.
AF11-2AC-130V1 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                  49


Mission Ready Aircrew Member—-An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
mission qualification and is maintaining all of the applicable mission qualification currency
requirements of this instruction.
Multiple Qualification—-A crewmember who is qualified in more than one MDS.
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—-Aircraft assigned to a unit for performance of
its wartime mission. PMAI forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and funding of flying hours.
Projectile Impact Point Prediction (PIPP)—-An AC-130U radar mode that estimates the
impact position of 40MM and 105MM projectiles using the APQ-180 radar set.
Self-Contained Approach (SCA)—-An approach conducted using self-contained navigation
systems on the aircraft.
Special Mission Events—-Some MR/MC crewmembers will carry additional qualifications in
special mission events. Unit CC/DO will determine which crewmembers will be qualified in
special mission events. Unit CC/DO will determine if special mission events have affected C-
rating and report variations through Status Of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS).
Special mission requirements are also shown in the RTM MR table.
Syllabus Deviation—-A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from syllabus or
equivalent directed requirement such as prerequisite flow, turn times, landing currency,
minimum number of events, etc.
Syllabus Waivers—-A planned one-time exception to the syllabus used to enhance or
accommodate student training in special or unusual circumstances.
Total Flying Time—-Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.
Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.).
Training Status—-A deficient status in which a crewmember must fly under the supervision of
an instructor when occupying a primary crew position. Once deficient items are corrected, the
crewmember is removed from training status.
Volume—-For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew
member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).
