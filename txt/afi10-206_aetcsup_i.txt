                                             Chapter 1

              GENERAL CONCEPTS, POLICIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Concept of the AF OPREP-3 System. The AF OPREP-3 system provides Chief of Staff
Air Force (CSAF) and intermediate commanders the information necessary for timely
operational decisions. The main criteria for inclusion in the AF OPREP-3 system is essential
information for command and control of aerospace forces.
     1.1.1. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRUs will not establish AF OPREP-3 report rules or instruction
     below Headquarters Air Force (HAF) level (i.e., Homelines.); but instead may develop
     MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Commander Critical Information Requirements (CCIR) in order to
     ensure events/incidents that do not meet AF OPREP-3 reporting requirements are still
     available to the commander.
        1.1.1.1. (Added-AETC) This supplement includes the requirements for Air Education
        and Training Command (AETC) CCIRs. As part of an effort to improve flow of critical
        AETC-centric information to AETC senior leaders, AETC CCIRs must be integrated into
        command post operations in accordance with assigned mission areas. Based upon the
        criticality of the items reported, the AETC Command Center will immediately up-
        channel the information to the AETC/CC, AETC/CV and/or designated AETC staff
        members.
     1.1.2. Due to the time sensitivity of AF OPREP-3 information, report each event/incident as
     promptly and accurately as possible. The FIRST command post (CP) having knowledge of
     an event/incident will report/facilitate AF OPREP-3 reporting. Units will not delay
     submission of an AF OPREP-3 to research if another unit is also submitting the report. In the
     case of multiple AF OPREP-3 submissions; the AFSWC will decide if multiple units will
     continue submitting or if one unit will continue all Follow Up reporting based on information
     received.
     1.1.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs are authorized to supplement this AFI with
     concurrence from AF/A3O on an AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request.
     Units at all levels will develop procedures to quickly obtain and report the key elements of an
     AF OPREP-3 report. Installations hosting units assigned to different MAJCOMs will
     develop host/tenant responsibilities in a Host Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA) and/or
     Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Each affected MAJCOM will coordinate on the MOA
     and review annually or as mission changes dictate. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs)
     will comply with parent MAJCOM guidance IAW this instruction.
     1.1.4. Air Force component commanders within combatant commands, Joint Bases (JB) or
     Joint Task Forces (JTF) will develop written guidance to ensure compliance with this
     instruction within their command and de-conflict with combatant, JB, or JTF command
     directives.
     1.1.5. Authority. This instruction includes the requirements of the various documents of the
     Joint Reporting Structure (JRS). Air Force units will use AFI 10-206 as the primary source
     for reporting instructions.
1.2. Responsibilities

   1.2.1. HQ USAF AF/A3O will:
       1.2.1.1. Develop and provide Air Force operational reporting guidance.
       1.2.1.2. Annually, review new requirements to determine operational necessity.
       1.2.1.3. Update the AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix as directed by the commander
       AF/A3O.
       1.2.1.4. Develop HAF Core Compliance criteria/checklist to be used to evaluate
       compliance with published directives.
   1.2.2. HQ USAF A3O-AOA will:

IAW Table 3.1.
       1.3.1.1. (Added-AETC) although instant contact from commanders to senior leaders
       may be a reasonable certainty, commanders should not utilize instant contact methods in
       lieu of the AF OPREP-3s and/or AETC CCIRs.
   1.3.2. Ensure HTSAs and/or MOAs outline operational reporting procedures between
   organizations. Agreements will outline procedures to ensure the installation command post
   is made aware of all events/incidents occurring on or affecting their installation. Established
   HTSAs/MOAs will not delay the submission of AF OPREP-3 reports by CP.
       1.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) HTSAs/MOAs will list supplier and receiver responsibilities.
       The host CP will provide a draft copy to HQ AETC/A3OC for coordination prior to

Figure 1.1. (Added-AETC) Example Memorandum of Agreement




    1.3.3. Installations operating with multiple MAJCOMs. Tenant commanders assigned to a
    different MAJCOM than the host unit, have the sole responsibility to report an event/incident
    affecting their assets that meet AF OPREP-3 reporting criteria through the host CP. When
    submitting a report for the tenant, the host CP will not interfere with, alter, or delay the tenant
    unit's report. Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC) commanders will ensure that all
    BEELINE and PINNACLE reports are submitted to the host/installation commander for
    upchanneling. A memorandum of agreement between the host and tenant wings with
    concurrence of the parent MAJCOMs is required.
AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                               9

   3/CCIR training for Joint Base San Antonio units (AF, tenant, sister service, etc.) IAW AFI
   10-206 and this supplement.
      1.8.1.1. (Added-AETC) Because of the large number of tenant units for Joint Base San
      Antonio, the 502 ABW/CP should collaborate with the 502 ABW/CC to develop a listing
      of frequently reportable units within the AF OPREP-3/AETC CCIR system. Those units
      will require training and tracking IAW AFI 10-206. Commanders and First Sergeants not
      designated by the 502 ABW/CC still require initial and semi-annual training, however,
      the only training documentation to be maintained IAW paragraph 1.4.2.1 is the date they
      were provided the training.
1.9. (Added-AETC) The 81 TRW/CP (Keesler AFB) will:
   1.9.1. (Added-AETC) Provide C2 support to the 2AF Commander. The 81 TRW/CP will

   recurring, and refresher) of CP controllers IAW AFI 10-206, AFI 10-207 and the Master
   Training Plan.
   1.11.3. (Added-AETC) Coordinate OPREP-3/CCIR reporting requirements and criteria
   with base agencies to ensure all events and incidents are promptly brought to the CPs
   attention. The fact that an OPREP-3/CCIR reportable event or incident has been or will be
   reported via other channels does not eliminate the requirement for an OPREP-3/CCIR.
   1.11.4. (Added-AETC) Ensure CPs do not enter into agreements with lateral agencies or
   MAJCOMs that dictate reporting criteria in violation of the basic AFI, this supplement,
   USMTF procedures, or CJCSM 3150.03D, Joint Reporting Structure Event and Incident
   Reports.

                  EVENT/INCIDENT REPORT (AF OPREP-3 REPORT)

3.1. Subject and Purpose. Air Force Commanders use AF OPREP-3s to immediately notify
higher headquarters of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of DoD, CJCS,
COCOM, or Service Level interests. Command post will submit the applicable AF OPREP-3
regardless of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels. AF OPREP-3
reports do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the Commander's
Situation Report (SITREP), and other directorate’s accident or incident investigation reports.
Submitting an AF OPREP-3 report does not change nor is it a substitute for any report required
by other directives. Real-world AF OPREP-3 reports take priority over exercise events.
3.2. Reporting Categories. CJCSM 3150.03D, Joint Reporting Structure Event and Incident
Reports, categorizes events or incidents according to their nature with a FLAGWORD.
FLAGWORDs (i.e., NUCFLASH, BENTSPEAR, etc.) associated with each category aid prompt
processing and distribution of the reports by alerting people to their importance. The following
FLAGWORDs identify reports within the CJCSM 3150.03D.
   3.2.1. PINNACLE (OPREP-3P). This report is used by any unit to provide the National
   Military Command Center (NMCC) and, as appropriate, combatant commands and services
   with immediate notification of any incident or event where national or international level
   interest is indicated. OPREP-3P reports are not restricted to operational information. Any
   inadvertent, accidental, unauthorized, or unexpected event or incident will be upgraded from
   an AF OPREP-3B to an AF OPREP-3P if:
       3.2.1.1. The occurrence is of such impact that it requires the immediate attention of the
       Secretary of Defense and the CJCS. Included are those occurrences that have actual or
       potential international repercussions, such as the creation of tension or undesirable
       relations between the United States and other countries.
       3.2.1.2. The occurrence has national-level interest that may significantly change current
       operations, or involve natural or human-made disasters or civil disorders.
       3.2.1.3. It is conceivable that the incident will cause the highest levels of government to
       require timely notification.
       3.2.1.4. Any doubt exists at any level as to whether an event or incident is or could
       possibly develop into a matter of White House, DOD, Joint Service, or major news
       media.
   3.2.2. PINNACLE NUCFLASH (OPREP-3PNF). Used to report an event, accident, or
   incident that could create the risk of a nuclear war. This report has the highest precedence in
   the OPREP-3 reporting structure. Report any of the following as an OPREP-3PNF if:
       3.2.2.1. Ballistic missile launch or space launch.
       3.2.2.2. Reentering space objects.
       3.2.2.3. Loss, potential loss, or degradation of US military space capability when the loss
       or degradation is because of actions by a suspected or known hostile source.
16                                              AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


     3.2.2.4. Reports of cruise missiles detected and/or launched against the US or US
     interests.
     3.2.2.5. Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained incident involving possible detonation
             of a nuclear weapon producing a nuclear yield.
     3.2.2.6. Unauthorized flight or deviation from an approved flight plan, by a US nuclear-
     armed or nuclear-capable aircraft with the capability to penetrate the airspace of another
     nuclear-capable country.
  3.2.3. PINNACLE FRONT BURNER (OPREP-3PFB). Used to report pre-conflict
  occurrence of armed attack, harassment, or hostile action against US forces, territory, or
  interests. After the OPREP-3PFB has been submitted for a specific hostile situation,
  subsequent OPREP-3P reports are not required. To report significant mission degradation or
  heavy losses, combat events and minor airfield damage will be reported in the SITREP.
  3.2.4. PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW (OPREP-3PBA). Used to report a US nuclear
  weapon accident that does not create the risk of a nuclear war. Report any of the following
  as an OPREP-3PBA if:
     3.2.4.1. Nuclear detonation of a U.S. nuclear weapon.
     3.2.4.2. Non-nuclear detonation or burning of a U.S. nuclear weapon.
     3.2.4.3. Radioactive contamination from a U.S. nuclear weapon or component.
     3.2.4.4. Jettisoning of a U.S. nuclear weapon or component.
     3.2.4.5. Public hazard, actual or implied, from a U.S. nuclear weapon or component.
  3.2.5. PINNACLE EMPTY QUIVER (OPREP-3PEQ). Used to report the seizure, theft, or
  loss of a U.S. nuclear weapon.

  operations involving the command disablement or nonviolent disablement of U.S. nuclear
  weapons.
  3.2.7. PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV).                          Used to report
  operations involving the emergency evacuation of U.S. nuclear weapons.
  3.2.8. OPREP-3 WHITE PINNACLE (OPREP-3WP). OPREP-3WP is used for exercise
  reports that contain simulated time-critical information from operating forces to the NMCC
  and combatant commanders. OPREP-3WP exercises use OPREP-3 procedures and is
  downward directed by the NMCC to check timeliness of select CPs and other designated
  Command and Control (C2) nodes.
     3.2.8.1. Combatant Commands designate the units to receive the exercise message and
     will select specific exercise start times. Upon receipt of an OPREP-3WP tasking, units
     are required to submit an OPREP-3WP acknowledgement report to the NMCC via
     synchronous (Jabber) means. The time standard is 20 Minutes.
     3.2.8.2. AF Command Posts units will transmit OPREP-3WP in the same fashion as AF
     OPREP-3P. Units will transmit an OPREP-3 WP IAW 3.2.8.3. to the “AF.Watch”
     Jabber room. Upon receipt, AFSWC controllers on duty will immediately turn the
     OPREP-3 WP to the NMCC “dod_njoic” Jabber room.

           3.2.8.3.2. Location (if not classified)
           3.2.8.3.3. Tasking COCOM
           3.2.8.3.4. DTG of the tasking message
           3.2.8.3.5. Unit time of receipt
           3.2.8.3.6. Acknowledgment addressing any known delays or initiative tracer actions
           (Note: Only applicable when acknowledgement exceeds 20 minute time standard).
   3.2.9. OPREP-3 BENT SPEAR (OPREP-3BS). Used to report incidents involving U.S.
   nuclear weapons that are of significant interest but are not categorized as PINNACLE
   NUCFLASH or PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW. CPs will submit BENT SPEAR reports
   using the same timing requirements as PINNACLEs.
   3.2.10. OPREP-3 FADED GIANT (OPREP-3FG). Used to report nuclear reactor or
   radiological accidents or incidents to the appropriate service headquarters. CPs will submit
   FADED GIANT reports using the same timing requirements as PINNACLEs.
3.2.11. DULL SWORD (DS). Used by any unit to report, in accordance with Service
guidelines, a nuclear weapon event not categorized as an accident or incident. The wing safety
office is responsible for making all DULL SWORD reports IAW AFMAN 91-221, Weapons
Safety Investigations and Reports.
   3.2.12. BEELINE (OPREP-3B). Used to report any event or incident that meets Air Force-
   level interest, but does not meet national or international level interest requirements.
   Although the report normally remains within USAF channels, BEELINE information is made
   available to agencies outside the USAF (NMCC, State Department, etc.) through
   asynchronous reporting.
3.3. Reports Guidebook. The Command Post NCOIC of Reports has the responsibility to
maintain the Reports Guidebook. This guide provides a quick reference to assist Command Post
controllers in submitting AF OPREP-3s and other reports, as applicable. The reports guidebook
will include:
   3.3.1. Current AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix. The AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix is a quick
   reference guide to assist commanders and controllers in determining the level/type of report
   to submit based on events and incidents deemed of interest to the CSAF and CJCS. Due to
   the need for reporting requirements to be updated as operational situations evolve and as
   A3O or higher directs; the AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix will be posted on SKIWeb
   (https://skiweb.stratcom.smil.mil/skiweb-web) under Communities of Interest/Air Force
   Service Watch Cell; as well as the SIPR Air Force Command Post Career Field Community
   of Practice (CoP) webpage for AFSC 1C3s to access. CPs will be notified of changes
   (through CP channels) as they are directed.
   3.3.2. Contact Address List Attachment 2, Table A2.1. are the core recipients for all AF
   OPREP-3s. Attachment 2 has been provided to assist during times of system inoperability.
   Units will ensure that affected HQs receive the report, regardless of how the report is
 18                                                AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


   transmitted. During routine operations wings/units will select applicable HQs based on
   situation, chain of command (COCOM, MAJCOM, etc) as well as “Affected Areas” from the
   event/incident when adding an event into SKIWeb. AFSWC will be selected as an “Affected
   Area” in SKIWeb on all AF OPREP-3s. Units may add additional contact information to the
   Reports Guidebook as required.
       3.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) CPs will select “2 AF” as a SKIWeb “Affected Area” (listed
       under AETC) for AF OPREP-3/AETC CCIR reports involving 2 AF personnel, facilities,
       and/or resources.
   3.3.3. AF OPREP-3 Reports Guide. The AF OPREP-3 Reports Guide, Attachment 3, Figure
   A3.1. is a list of minimum routine questions that need to be answered when including data
   into an AF OPREP-3 report.
   3.3.4. Checklists containing step-by-step procedures to ensure required reports are submitted
   in the proper format, within established timelines, and with the correct content.
3.4. AF OPREP-3 Report Timing Requirements. Wing/units will use Table 3.1. for
synchronous/asynchronous timing requirements. Where a qualified/certified specialist must be
consulted to determine if an AF OPREP-3 event/incident has occurred according to AF OPREP-
3 Reports Matrix requirements (i.e., weapons maintenance on a weapons outage, medical
provider for confirmation of death) timing standards will begin from CP notification of the
determination rather than incident (IAW Table 3.1). Justification for delay, as well as the time
the event initially occurred will be included in the report.

Table 3.1. Timing Criteria
Type of Report               Synchronous Report/Voice Report Asynchronous Report/Record
                             Timing (Voice Report will be         Copy Timing (Record Copy
                             accomplished IAW para 3.10)          Reports will be accomplished
                                                                  IAW para 3.10)

*PINNACLE NUCFLASH           5 minutes from incident              1 hour from incident
PINNACLE/BEELINE             15 minutes from incident             1 hour from incident
*NOTE: PINNACLE Nuclear Flash reports are extremely time sensitive and require initial
reporting within 5 minutes of the incident.
3.5. Synchronous Reports. Synchronous communication is defined as where all parties
involved in the communication are present at the same time (an event). Examples include a
telephone conversation, a chat room event and instant messaging. Units will submit a
synchronous report using SIPRNet Jabber for all AF OPREP-3 Initial, Follow Up, Final,
Correction, and Initial/Final reports. Do not delay the initial Jabber notification to obtain
additional information. The initial Jabber notification time will be the time inputted into the
system. Use Follow Up notifications and reporting to provide additional information as it
becomes available. AFSWC/MAJCOMs will assess unit reports for possible higher category
reporting requirements.
   3.5.1. Units submitting an AF OPREP-3 Jabber report will enter notifications into the
   “AF.Watch” room regardless of the type of report being reported: classification, title IAW
   para 3.10.5., whether the report is an Initial, Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final or Correction as
AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                             19


   well as a brief synopsis of information known, and in sentence case. See Figure 3.1. Jabber
   Notification Example.
   3.5.2. Units submitting an Exercise AF OPREP-3 Jabber report will enter notifications into
   “AF.Exercise” room regardless of the type of report being reported: classification, title IAW
   para 3.10.5., whether the report is an Initial, Initial/Final, Follow Up or Final, as well as a
   brief synopsis of information known, and in sentence case. See Figure 3.1, Jabber
   Notification Example.
Figure 3.1. Jabber Notification Example


(U) AF OPREP-3B, 111726ZJUN2010, 173 FW, Kingsley Fld, OR, Civilian Aircraft Near Miss,
Rule XX (U)
Initial:
At 111726ZJUN10, F-15D C/S Bean 1, T/N 79008 was involved in a near miss with a civilian
Gulfstream AC90 while on an instrument approach to RWY 14 with clearance to land at
Klamath Falls Airport, OR. The AC90 was under VFR after receiving clearance to takeoff. The
incident is under investigation, at this time it is unknown how close the aircraft came to one
another. Media attention is unknown.




   3.5.3. AFSWC and MAJCOM Command Centers will acknowledge wing/unit reports within
   5 minutes of the posting. Acknowledgement can be in any hierarchy order. In the event that
   a Higher Headquarters (HHQ) element does not acknowledge within 5 minutes; the wing/unit
   will contact their parent MAJCOM Command Center for assistance. HHQs will then provide
   acknowledgement through Jabber. AFSWC will always be the highest level of required
   acknowledgement regardless of report type.
   3.5.4. (Added-AETC) Although initial synchronous reports are not required for AETC
   CCIRs, reporting CPs will notify the AETC Command Center (telephonically or within the
   AETC Command Center Jabber room) when a CCIR event is determined REPORTABLE by
   the reporting commander. When AETC CCIR reports are submitted, the reporting unit must
   ensure the AETC Command Center acknowledges receipt of the CCIR report within 5
   minutes of posting. The initial CCIR development notification of the AETC Command
   Center does not replace this requirement.
3.6. Asynchronous Reports. Asynchronous communication does not require that all parties
involved in the communication need to be present and available at the same time. Examples of
this include e-mail (the receiver does not have to be logged on when the sender sends the e-mail
message), discussion boards, which allow conversations to evolve and community to develop
over a period of time. Units will submit an asynchronous report using SKIWeb for all Initial,
Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final, and Corrected AF OPREP-3 reports.
3.6. (AETC)Asynchronous Reports. Units will submit an asynchronous report using SKIWeb
for all Initial, Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final, and Corrected AETC CCIR reports. Every attempt
will be made to send CCIRs as final reports
 20                                                AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


   3.6.1. Reports will contain (as known at the time) the who, what, when, where, why, how,
   operational impact, media applicability, and other pertinent information of the event/incident
   being reported based on available information. Units will include any updated information
   gathered after the initial Jabber notification without exceeding the time criteria. Do not delay
   asynchronous reporting to obtain additional information.
   3.6.2. All efforts should be made to ensure AFSWC has acknowledged Jabber notifications
   prior to posting in SKIWeb, and that all questions from any HHQs has been answered.
   3.6.3. AFSWC/MAJCOMs will assess unit reports for possible higher category reporting
   requirements.
   3.6.4. The primary means for transmitting AF OPREP-3 reports is via asynchronous means.
   When primary means are unavailable, transmit AF OPREP-3 reports by the fastest means
   available consistent with security constraints IAW Para 3.11.
   3.6.5. Ensure reports containing classified or special intelligence information are marked
   properly.
   3.6.6. If not answered in the Initial record report, Follow Up reporting will continue until all
   of the following questions are answered: who, what, when, where, why, and how as the
   information becomes available.
   3.6.7. If seven calendar days have elapsed from the Initial report and these questions are not
   answered, a Final AF OPREP-3 report will be submitted stating that “No further information
   will be provided through AF OPREP-3 channels.” Identify approved points of contact
   (POC), agency(ies), and contact number(s).
   3.6.7. (AETC) If seven calendar days have elapsed from the initial AETC CCIR report and
   these questions are not answered, a final AETC CCIR report will be submitted stating that
   “No further information will be provided through AETC CCIR channels.” Identify approved
   points of contact (POC), agency(s), and contact number(s).
3.7. MINIMIZE. Submission of AF OPREP-3 reports will not be affected by MINIMIZE.
3.8. Appropriate Report Content. While the narrative section of each report must clearly
convey the details of the incident, reports will not be personally identifiable to an individual. To
ensure anonymity reports may contain:
   3.8.1. Age, gender, duty status (e.g., active duty, ARC (whether on orders or not) ), rank (if
   applicable), DoD civilian status, and assigned unit/agency.
   3.8.2. If HHQ requires names/social security number (SSN), they will request it as an
   addendum separate from AF OPREP-3 report. Only the last 4 digits of the SSN will be
   provided.
   3.8.3. Name, title, and phone number of safety board president for aircraft accidents.
   3.8.4. Name of a public figure whose death occurs on an Air Force installation.
   3.8.5. Name of a deceased retired AF VIP (i.e. flag officer or CMSAF).
   3.8.6. Aircraft type, tail number, owning unit, aircrew unit and squadron, type mission, and
   mission number for all reports involving Air Force owned, contracted, or operated aircraft.
AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                              21


   3.8.7. Name and telephone number for Civilian Personnel Section point of contact for
   civilian deaths.
3.9. Inappropriate Report Content. Although the narrative section of each report must clearly
convey the details of the incident, it will not include:
   3.9.1. Any speculation regarding responsibility, failure of equipment or facilities, legal
   liability, or causes.
   3.9.2. Quotations or opinions from witnesses or other privileged sources.
   3.9.3. Use of personal information to include name (see exceptions above), SSN, or home
   address.
3.10. Asynchronous Report Construction: Initial, Initial/Final, Follow Up, Final, and
Corrected Reports.
   3.10.1. Initial reports contain as much information as immediately available within
   established time parameters about an event or incident. Initial reports will be submitted IAW
   para 3.5. Upon acknowledgement from the AFSWC, the AF OPREP-3 will then be posted
   into SKIWeb by selecting “Add an Event” feature. AF OPREP-3s will be in sentence case.
   An Initial Report may be submitted as an Initial/Final report if it contains all of the required
   information to close the report. Initial/Final reports will be submitted IAW para 3.10.6.4.
   3.10.2. Follow Up reports are essential to keep commanders informed of developing
   situations and to provide additional details as they are learned. Follow Up reports will be
   submitted IAW para 3.5. Upon acknowledgement from the AFSWC, the AF OPREP-3 will
   then be posted into SKIWeb by selecting the “Add a Blog” feature. AF OPREP-3s will be in
   sentence case.
   3.10.3. Final reports will provide required information not previously reported and close
   event/incident reporting.    Final reports will be submitted IAW para 3.5.          Upon
   acknowledgement from the AFSWC, the AF OPREP-3 will be entered into SKIWeb by
   selecting the “Add a Blog” feature. AF OPREP-3s will be in sentence case. Final reports
   will be submitted IAW para 3.10.6.4.
   3.10.4. SKIWeb Corrected reports will be sent when factual data needs to be corrected.
   Corrected reports will be entered into SKIWeb by selecting the “Add a Blog” feature. AF
   OPREP-3 Corrected reports will be in sentence case. The first line of the corrected report
   will state “Correction to AF OPREP-3 B/P DDMMHHZMMMYYYY report”. Retyping the
   report is not the intent. Include only corrected information, but enough to aid the reader in
   understanding what was corrected.
   3.10.5. AF OPREP-3 Message Subject Line. Regardless of transmission medium, all AF
   OPREP-3 subject lines will be constructed in the following manner:
   3.10.5.1. Service Affiliation.
       3.10.5.2. Type of Report (OPREP-3P, OPREP-3PFB, OPREP-3B, etc.).
       3.10.5.3. DTG and Location Event Occurred. This time will not change as subsequent
       reports are added.
       3.10.5.4. Event/Incident and Rule Number.
22                                              AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


     3.10.5.5. As an example:      AF OPREP-3B, 132000ZMay2010, Andrews AFB, MD,
     Aircraft Mishap, Rule 2B.
     3.10.5.5. (AETC) As an example of an AETC CCIR subject line:                AETC CCIR,
     071315ZDec2012, Keesler AFB, MS, Commanders Discretion, Rule ##.
  3.10.6. Reports body will be written to the following standard:
     3.10.6.1. The first AF OPREP-3 record copy report will include the time the
     event/incident occurred in the beginning of the report.
     3.10.6.2. The body of the report narrative will include the who, what, when, where, why,
     and how of the incident. In the initial report, report what is known at the time. Include
     new information as details unfold. In subsequent reports, do not restate previously stated
     facts.
     3.10.6.3. The statement “Further reporting through XXX channels.” will only be used
     after consulting and confirming with the appropriate external agency(ies) that further
     reports will be accomplished through their channels, include agency office symbol and
     contact number. This statement will not be used as a blanket statement.
     3.10.6.4. All Final reports will end with the applicable statement, “No further
     information will be provided through AF OPREP-3 channels.” as well as add the word
     “Closed” at the end of the subject line. To edit the subject line, use the “Edit Event”
     feature.
     3.10.6.5. Information requested by AFSWC (or HHQ element) during synchronous
     reporting will be provided in an asynchronous report when the information becomes
     available. Reports are not authorized to be closed prior to answering questions from the
     asking HHQ element.
     3.10.6.6. When events/incidents occur which overlap multiple rule numbers, units will
     combine them and submit one OPREP-3. If multiple rule numbers specify different types
     of OPREPs, i.e. BEELINE, PINNACLE, units will submit the highest type report. For
     AF OPREPs with multiple rule numbers, only one rule number and title will be reflected
     in the subject line; use the initial events rule number that resulted in the multiple event
     occurring. For example use 9K, Bomb Threat in the subject line for the following
     scenario: Bomb Threat; FPCON Change; Death, Air Force Member; Criminal Activity
     (News Media).        Additional rule numbers will be reflected at the bottom of
     synchronous/asynchronous (i.e., Rules XX, XX and XX also apply.)
     3.10.6.7. Upgrading Reports. Units will upgrade AF OPREP-3 reports if Follow Up
     information to an event/incident meets the criteria of a higher-level report (e.g.,
     BEELINE to PINNACLE). In the upgraded Initial Report, provide all previously
     reported information and known facts even if previously reported to a lower level.
     Upgrading a report automatically closes any lower level reports previously submitted by
     the wings/units. Units will make a Jabber notification stating the previous subject line
     from the lower level report has been upgraded along with the reason (cost estimate,
     media attention, etc.) Upgraded AF OPREP-3 reports will be blogged in SKiWeb, and
     the subject line updated to reflect the change.
AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                        23


      3.10.6.8. United States Military Text Formatting (USMTF). In the event that both
      synchronous/asynchronous mediums are inoperable and the AF OPREP-3 meets
      PINNACLE criteria, wings/units will submit the PINNACLE in USMTF format IAW
      para 3.11.2. BEELINE reports will remain in plain text regardless of system operability
      and will be sent IAW para 3.11.1.
3.11. Synchronous/Asynchronous Outages.
   3.11.1. BEELINE:
      3.11.1.1. If Jabber is out:

      account. Upon system return, wing/unit will upload all reports submitted during the
      outage to SKIWeb.
   3.11.2. PINNACLES:
      3.11.2.1. If Jabber is out:
         3.11.2.1.1. Notify the next HHQ that has access to Jabber for input (NAF, MAJCOM
         Command Center, AFSWC).
         3.11.2.1.2. If total Jabber outage, convene telephone voice conference.
      3.11.2.2. If SKIWeb is out:

         SKIWeb.
         3.11.2.2.2. If SKIWeb and Jabber are both NOT functional, email report on SIPRNet
         to next HHQ that has access to SKIWeb for input (NAF, MAJCOM Command
         Center, AFSWC)
      3.11.2.3. If total SKIWeb AND Jabber outage, email AF OPREP-3P via SIPRNet, in
      USMTF format to the AF OPREP-3 Distro List on the GAL from the CP organizational
      account. AFSWC will in turn submit the AF OPREP-P via SIPRNet Automated Message
      Handling System (AMHS) (or other means as directed by the NMCC.) Upon system
      return, wing/unit will upload all reports submitted during the outage to SKIWeb.

   AF OPREP-3/AETC CCIR reports regarding AETC personnel, facilities and/or resources,
   and those AF reports of interest to the AETC/CC and designated HQ staff members.
   Significant Event reports contain sensitive information and will be released strictly on a
   need-to-know basis. Individuals can request information access through HQ AETC/A3OC.
   Unit, agency, workflow, and group accounts will not be granted access. HQ AETC/A3O will
   review all requests and grant access as required. The reporting requirement in Chapter 3 is
   exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and
   Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal Public, and Interagency Air Force
   Information Collections.
   3.15.2. (Added-AETC) The AETC Command Center will develop and transmit the
   Significant Events report to the AETC/CC, designated HQ staff members, Wing
   Commanders and Wing Command Chiefs no later than 0700 Central Standard Time (CST)
   each calendar day.
AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                            25


      3.15.2.1. (Added-AETC) The AETC Command Center will not alter the content of any
      submitted AF OPREP-3/AETC CCIR report.          Grammar and spelling are the
      responsibility of the originating command post.
      3.15.2.2. (Added-AETC) The AETC Command Center may insert questions answered
      on DSCA reports into the Significant Events report to improve readability.

                    COMMANDER'S SITUATION REPORT (SITREP)

4.1. Subject and Purpose. To keep the MAJCOMs, Services, Joint Staff, and SECDEF
apprised of existing political, military, and operational situations/plans and to keep commanders
advised of a unit’s ability to meet requirements outlined in approved plans. The SITREP is a
narrative report that informs and enables higher levels of command to evaluate resources and
prepare for potential effects of ongoing situations. The commander or designated alternate is
responsible for timely and accurate SITREP reporting. Situation reporting will be accomplished
for, but not limited to, the following:
   4.1.1. Involvement in critical national or international situations.
   4.1.2. Involvement in natural or manmade disasters and/or emergency relief efforts.
   4.1.3. Significant operational deficiencies that affect mission readiness.
   4.1.4. Other activities or ongoing operations to include Defense Support to Civil Authorities
   (DSCA). All DSCA events should be reported as described in Chapter 6.
   4.1.5. Units receiving aircraft or personnel due to natural disasters (i.e. HURCON/TCCOR)
   evacuations.
4.2. Submitted By. Commanders at all levels of command report as required by operations
plans and directives, or higher headquarters or when ongoing events warrant SITREP reporting.
4.3. Submitted To. SITREPs will be uploaded as an attachment in SKIWeb in non-USMTF
format and AFSWC will be checked as an “Affected Area.”
4.4. Submission Timing. Reports will be submitted daily (or more frequently if directed by
AF/A3O-OA) for the duration of the activity or operation. Unless specified otherwise by a
combatant commander directive, submit reports no later than 0200Z, reflecting data current as of
2359Z.
4.5. Submission. The primary means for transmitting SITREPs is via SKIWeb. When primary
means is unavailable, transmit reports by the fastest means available consistent with security
constraints, (i.e. SIPR email). MAJCOMs/DRUs/FOAs will make a Jabber notification in the
AF.Watch room stating a SITREP has been submitted to SKiWeb. Continue to report during
MINIMIZE unless directed otherwise by the implementing authority.
4.6. General Reporting Instructions.
   4.6.1. Duplicate reporting is not desired; however, information available in another JRS
   report will be referenced to ensure operational impacts are noted.
   4.6.2. Any higher headquarters level in the reporting chain may direct additional reporting
   requirements. AF/A3O-OA is authorized to request any additional/amplifying information
   on past events, current operations, or planned actions.
4.7. Report Content. Air Force SITREPs will report significant factors relating primarily to
readiness, mobilization personnel, force protection, and logistics. Report content should

                              CRESCENT EDGE (OPREP-3CE)

7.1. Used to immediately notify the Joint Staff, or Air Force, of significant activities
involving Special Access Programs (SAPs) operating IAW AFI 16-701, Special Access
Programs (SAP). Affected unit CPs will submit voice reports through normal CP channels. The
flag words BEELINE and PINNACLE are used to reference the SAP management level to be
contacted. Regardless of the SAP management level, AFSWC will address SAF/AAZ (Air
Force Special Access Program Central Office). MAJCOMs will establish procedures for
contacting program managers at and below the MAJCOM level.
   7.1.1. The AF OPREP-3CE report allows units operating SAPs to use the operational
   reporting channel to advise their program managers of events or incidents that meet AF
   OPREP-3 reporting criteria. The AF OPREP-3CE report is the single reporting channel for
   all SAP units reporting incidents to HHQ. An AF OPREP-3CE report will be submitted
   when an authorized individual from the unit has determined an event or incident involving a
   SAP warrants higher-level awareness. AF OPREP-3CE reports will be forwarded through
   CP channels to MAJCOM Command Centers and the AFSWC.
   7.1.2. The unit with the SAP, not the CP, initiates AF OPREP-3CE reporting. The initiating
   unit will notify the CP of an AF OPREP-3CE report to be submitted. No program names or
   incident details are included and CP personnel will not press for details. The CP will send
   the report up the chain to the appropriate level. It is the reporting unit’s responsibility, to
   determine the level of report to provide all information. After report submission CP
   performs no other action.
   7.1.3. AF OPREP-3CE will not be reported via synchronous/asynchronous means.
      7.1.3.1. CPs will upchannel AF OPREP-3CE through voice conference with MAJCOM
      and AFSWC, only including the information listed in para 7.2.
      7.1.3.2. CPs will transmit a narrative email via NIPRNet/SIPRNet (based on
      classification) to their MAJCOM Command Center and AFSWC. At the request of the
      SAP Manager, AFSWC will notify NMCC of the report providing only the information
      listed in para 7.2.
7.2. Only the following information will be included in the AF OPREP-3CE voice and hard
copy report:
   7.2.1. The time the unit initiates the report.
   7.2.2. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the person at the unit initiating the
   report.
   7.2.3. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the program manager at the
   appropriate higher headquarters.

                               CYBER INCIDENT REPORTING

8.1. Used to report any Cyber Incident meeting CJCSM 6510. 01A, Information Assurance
and Computer Network Defense Vol 1 (Incident Handling Program), reporting requirements that
warrant Air Force or Joint level attention. Incidents are not limited to NIPRNet-connected
computers; other stand-alone systems could be affected. While the Air Force’s formal incident
Handling Program is centralized within 24AF as the Air Force’s Computer Network Defense
Service Provider (CNDSP), this does not preclude a commander’s authority to release AF
OPREP-3s for activity affecting their command or causing operational impact prior to 24AF’s
formal declaration that an event or activity is an incident IAW CJCSM 6510.01A.
8.2. As the Air Force's service component to USCYBERCOM, AFCYBER (24AF) is
responsible for the operation and defense of the Air Force-provisioned portion of the
Global Information Grid (AF-GIG). They will normally be the first to detect or be the first to
be notified by external entities of cyber intrusions, attacks, or outages on the AF-GIG. 24AF is
responsible for the operation and defense of the AF-GIG and will normally be the first to detect
or be the first notified by external entities of cyber intrusions or attacks on the AF-GIG through
the 624th Operations Center (OC). 624OC has the responsibility, on behalf of 24AF, to
telephonically notify all affected installations of cyber intrusions or attacks.
   8.2.1. If 624OC first discovers or is first notified of cyber intrusion/attack or incident
   affecting multiple installations, MAJCOMs, or the AF-GIG, the 624OC/CC will notify the
   AFSPC Command Center of a potential AF OPREP-3 requirement and provide them with
   pertinent information.
   8.2.2. If an installation is notified by 24AF/CC or the 624OC of a confirmed outage,
   intrusion, attack, or incident the affected unit will notify the Commander, servicing
   Communications Squadron/Flight/Communications Focal Point (CFP), and servicing CP.
   The Installation Commander will make a determination if the incident meets AF OPREP-3
   criteria.
   8.2.3. If an installation is the first to   discover a cyber outage, intrusion, attack, or incident,
   the affected unit will notify their          Commander, servicing Communications Squadron,
   servicing CP and report the event            IAW AFI 33-138, Enterprise Network Operations
   Notification and Tracking, Chap 5.            The Commander will make a determination if the
   incident meets AF OPREP-3 criteria.

                                 Chapter 9 (Added-AETC)

            COMMANDER CRITICAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS

9.1. (Added-AETC) Subject and Purpose. AETC Commanders use AETC Commander
Critical Information Requirements (CCIR) reporting to immediately notify higher headquarters
of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of MAJCOM or Combatant
Commander (COCOM) interests. CP will submit the applicable AETC CCIR report regardless
of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels. AETC CCIR reports do not
replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the Commander's Situation Report
(SITREP), and other directorate’s accident or incident investigation reports. Submitting an
AETC CCIR report does not change nor is a substitute for any report required by other
directives. Real-world AETC CCIR reports take priority over exercise events.
   9.1.1. (Added-AETC) Objective criteria for determining whether an event or incident is
   reportable as a CCIR are provided in AETC C2 Controller Information Files (CIFs). The
   listing is not all-inclusive and commanders should not restrict reporting to these specific
   categories. The Wing Commander is always the final reporting authority. Any event or
   incident that is significant and, in the judgment of the commander, warrants HQ AETC
   interest, should be up-channeled as a CCIR. The CCIR listing will be modified by HQ
   AETC/A3OC based upon AETC senior leadership direction.
   9.1.2. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIR Mission Impact reports. There are no objective criteria
   for events reported as Mission Impact. It is the Wing Commander’s determination on
   mission impact events/incidents. Types of mission impact events can include, but are not
   limited to, runway closures, significant mission sortie cancellations (due to weather, ops,
   etc.), or outages affecting mission accomplishment. CP controllers must ensure AETC CCIR
   mission impact events do not fit prescribed AF OPREP-3 Beeline or Pinnacle criteria.
   9.1.3. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIR reports are overarching MAJCOM level reporting
   guidance used to ensure rapid reporting to the AETC Command Center for any significant
   event or incident that rises to the level of AETC senior leaders and AETC staff agencies.
   AETC CCIR reports do not replace the requirement for reports meeting AF OPREP-3 criteria
   and other directorate’s accident or incident investigation reports.
   9.1.4. (Added-AETC) If the AETC Command Center subsequently determines a CCIR
   merits Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), or lateral-
   command interest; it will direct the unit to submit the appropriate OPREP through required
   channels. Any additional or follow-up reporting will be reflected in the appropriate OPREP.
   9.1.5. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIRs must be clear, comprehensive, and generally answers
   the questions in paragraph 3.6.1 The AF OPREP-3 Reports Guide, Attachment 3, Figure
   A3.1. is a list of minimum routine questions that should be answered when including data
   into an AETC CCIR report. AETC CCIRs will follow the same guidance and principles as
   AF OPREP-3 reports in relation to timing, report body content and construction requirements
   for asynchronous reporting.
   9.1.6. (Added-AETC) The FIRST AETC CP having knowledge of an event/incident
   meeting AETC CCIR criteria will report/facilitate the AETC CCIR report. Units will not
36                                             AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


  delay submission of an AETC CCIR to research if another AETC unit is also submitting the
  report.
  9.1.7. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIRs Transmission:
  9.1.7.1. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIRs will be sent in the same method as an AF OPREP-3
  report; the difference is that a Jabber (synchronous) report containing a brief synopsis of
  known information is not required.
  9.1.7.2. (Added-AETC) Command Posts will submit AETC CCIR reports via SKIWeb
  selecting only “AETC” under the MAJCOM “Affected Areas.” Report content will be
  sentence case and reports must be clear, comprehensive, and generally answer the questions
  in paragraph 3.6.1 The AF OPREP-3 Reports Guide, Attachment 3, Figure A3.1. is a list of
  minimum routine questions that should be answered when including data into an AETC
  CCIR report. AETC CCIR report subject lines will identify:
     9.1.7.2.1. (Added-AETC) A. Type of report: AETC CCIR.
     9.1.7.2.2. (Added-AETC) B. DTG and Location of Event: Time will not change during
     Follow-up reporting.
     9.1.7.2.3. (Added-AETC) C. Event Title: Refer to CCIR Matrix.
     9.1.7.2.4. (Added-AETC) D. Report Type: INITIAL, INITIAL/FINAL, FOLLOW UP,
     FINAL or CORRECTION.
     9.1.7.2.5. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIR subject line example: AETC CCIR,
     071315ZDec2012, Keesler AFB, MS, Commanders Discretion, FINAL, Rule A01.
  9.1.7.3. (Added-AETC) If SKIWeb is out and Jabber is functional, post the AETC CCIR
  report into the AETC Command Center Jabber room. The AETC Command Center will
  access SKIWeb for input into the respective “Affected Areas.”
  9.1.7.4. (Added-AETC) If SKIWeb and Jabber are both NOT functional, email CCIR
  report on SIPRNet to the AETC Command Center organizational account. The AETC
  Command Center will access SKIWeb for input into the respective “Affective Areas.”
  9.1.7.5. (Added-AETC) If total SKIWeb AND Jabber outage, email AETC CCIR via
  SIPRNet. Upon system return, wing/unit CPs will upload all CCIR reports submitted during
  the outage to SKIWeb.
  9.1.7.6. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIR Report Timing Requirements. CPs will submit the
  AETC CCIR asynchronous report within 1 hour from the event/incident occurrence. Where
  a qualified/certified specialist must be consulted to determine if an AETC CCIR
  event/incident has occurred according to AETC CCIR requirements, the timing standards
  will begin from CP notification of the determination rather than incident. Justification for
  delay, as well as the time the event initially occurred will be included in the report.
  9.1.7.7. (Added-AETC) Training for AETC CCIRs Commander Training will be
  conducted in the same manner as AF OPREP-3 training as prescribed in para 1.4.2.1
AFI10-206_AETCSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                     37




  9.1.7.8. (Added-AETC) AETC CCIR reports will be retained in the same way as AF
  OPREP-3 reports.
