1. Policy. It is the policy of the 309th Maintenance Wing (309 MXW) to manage an industrial
fund that is economically and/or mission-essential justified. The overall program should provide
support to current and programmed workload and to a mobilization effort, when required. This
Instruction does not take the place, nor does it supersede AFMCI 21-109.
    1.1. The 309 MXW Business Operations Office (309 MXW/OBF) has overall program
    management responsibility and is the designated office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
    equipment, ADPE and minor construction for DMAG designated as CPP. Each group will
    designate a primary and alternate CPP monitor that will be responsible for the program with
    that group. It is recommended when the group has an engineering/planning organization, the
    designated office or individual should be in that organization. The Maintenance and Repair
    (M&R) OPR is 309th Maintenance Support Squadron (309 MXSS/MXDEAD).
NOTE: All hard copies of this publication are considered uncontrolled copies, only the
electronic version that resides on the organizational home page will be considered
controlled. In instances where a hard copy of an instruction is utilized, it is the user's
responsibility to verify that the copy is the most current one available. This will be
accomplished by comparing the date on the hard copy with the date on the electronic
version.
    1.2. The 309 MXW/OBF and each maintenance group will ensure all infrastructure
    investments are focused on resolving the capability gaps or achieving the returns on
    investment identified in the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) Long-term Depot
    Strategy Implementation Plan. A 5-year CPP Industrial Resource plan will be developed by
    the CPP Working Group and maintained electronically by the 309 MXW/OBF office. The
    plan will identify equipment, ADPE and minor construction requirements for the current
    year, budget year, 1 out year, and a projected requirements list for 2 additional years. All
    requirements will be identified by priority of need to accommodate the budget fluctuation
    without having to realign the overall program. The current year funded requirements
    identified in the plan will be input into the Defense Industrial Financial Management System
    (DIFMS) Fixed Assets data system. Equipment and facilities will be maintained as required
    to provide current information. Projected data will be changed to actual data as soon as
    actual data is available (1 year).
    1.3. Each 309 MXW group will be represented by a CPP point of contact (monitor), primary
    and alternate, and will participate as a member of the CPP Working Group (CPPWG) to
    provide required input and attempt to resolve issues. The CPPWG members are identified as
309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  3


   309th Electronics Maintenance Group (309 EMXG), 309th Commodities Maintenance
   Group, 309th Software Maintenance Group (309 SMXG), 309th Aircraft Maintenance Group
   (309 AMXG), 309th Missile Maintenance Group (309 MMXG), 309th Maintenance Support
   Group (309 MXSG), 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG).
   Representatives of other organizations, such as the 527th Electronics Maintenance Squadron
   (309 EMXS) Precision Measuring Equipment Laboratory PMEL, 542d Automated Test
   Equipment Support Group (542 ATSG), Association of Federal Government Employees
   (AFGE) 1592 and the Logistics Readiness Squadron, 75 LRS/LGRS, may be invited to
   working group meetings dependent on the agenda.
   1.4. Each section is referenced within the OO-ALC CPP Overarching Process Flow Chart
   provided in Attachment 2.
   1.5. For simplicity in this guide, the CPP process is divided into three sections; requirement
   processes, budget processes, and execution processes. Each section of the CPP process is
   further defined below.
2. Requirement Processes for the Maintenance Groups:
   2.1. The term ―  group‖ refers to the DMAG organizations defined above. Each group CPP
   monitor will coordinate with process engineers, users, System Program Office (SPO) and/or
   customers to identify potential CPP requirements. This identification may be derived from a
   data call to process engineers, squadron leaders, equipment custodians using the criteria and
   guidance provided, or this information may be identified during recurring staff meetings.
   The group CPP monitors will maintain a current list of CPP projects and will query engineers
   and production managers for potential CPP submissions.
   2.2. As a general rule, requirements identification is a continuous process within the groups.
   Should there be an urgent or newly identified requirement, that requirement(s) should be
   communicated to the CPP Manager as soon as possible for identification of possible funding
   (i.e., reprogramming, Integrated Financial Review (IFR) funding, etc.).
   2.3. Capital Equipment - includes equipment purchases (new or replacement) that cost
   $250,000 or more, rehabilitation of existing equipment that costs $250,000 or more,
   modification of existing equipment that costs $250,000 or more, or the combined cost of
   components comprising a system that costs $250,000 or more. These purchases must have a
   useful life of 2 years or more.
      2.3.1. The analytical section in the 309 MXSG is required to be involved in this process
      to ensure maintainability and spare parts supplies. Technicians in the shop should be
      involved in the equipment installation, testing and operation training.
      2.3.2. For all equipment that requires calibration, the calibration procedures must be
      purchased as part of the equipment buy. The 309 EMXS/PMEL is required to be
      involved in this process to ensure maintainability of equipment.
      2.3.3. The CPP requirements must be planned, programmed, managed, obligated,
      executed, and reported in one of the following five categories: Weapon System
      Sustainment (WSS), Test and Inspection Equipment, Minor Construction (MC), ADPE
      and Telecommunications Equipment, or Software Development.
4                                                       309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010


           2.3.3.1. Weapon System Sustainment Equipment. This category includes new and
           replacement equipment purchases, rehabilitation of existing equipment, and
           modification of existing equipment not designed for test and inspection.
           2.3.3.2. Test and Inspection Equipment.         This category includes new and
           replacement equipment purchases, rehabilitation of existing equipment, and
           modification of existing equipment specifically designed for performance of test and
           inspection on depot maintenance workloads.
           2.3.3.3. Minor Construction. New facility construction or alteration of existing
           facility up to $750,000 and meeting the definition of MC as provided in AFI 32-1032,
           Ch 3, Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and
           Construction Projects. The MC includes replacement, productivity, environmental or
           new mission projects.
           2.3.3.4. The ADPE and Telecommunications Equipment. This category consists of
           computer hardware, operating system software (including utility and communications
           software), and telecommunications equipment. The ADPE and telecommunications
           equipment projects include replacement, productivity, environmental, or new mission.
           2.3.3.5. Software Development. This category includes the actual development and
           acquisition of the information system (both in-house (organic) and contractor
           support). This category does not include software developed for a customer for use in
           a weapons system. For additional guidance on software, see DoDFMR 7000.14-R,
           Vol 2B, Ch 9, Budget Formulation and Presentation.
    2.4. The CPP requirements are typically driven by the following sources:
       2.4.1. Transformation.
       2.4.2. Overtime caused by problem.
       2.4.3. Equipment downtime.
       2.4.4. Obsolete equipment.
       2.4.5. New mission.
       2.4.6. Sustainment of current mission.
       2.4.7. Technology.
       2.4.8. Safety/Health/Fire/Environmental.
       2.4.9. XP – long range and yearly workload projections.
    2.5. Projects will consider the following solutions for each CPP candidate:
       2.5.1. Upgrade.
       2.5.2. Replacement.
       2.5.3. Contract.
       2.5.4. Buy new.
       2.5.5. Buy refurbished.
309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   5


     2.5.6. Move workload.
     2.5.7. Change/improve processes.
  2.6. Estimates will be created at a high level Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to include:
     2.6.1. Materials costs and source(s).
     2.6.2. Equipment purchase cost and source(s).
     2.6.3. Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs and sources.
     2.6.4. Notional schedule.
     2.6.5. Facilities modifications (i.e., self-help).
     2.6.6. Minor construction costs.
  2.7. The following guidance is provided for estimates:
     2.7.1. Cost estimates for OO-ALC organic work will use labor and material costs
     appropriate to the Resource Control Center (RCC) that will be accomplishing the work.
     2.7.2. Plans and cost estimates that involve contract services via Purchase Requests (PR)
     requiring 75th Contracting Squadron (75 CONS) action will be outlined in the files.
     2.7.3. Specialty equipment from weapons systems will be identified if required.
  2.8. Some exclusions from the CPP are:
     2.8.1. Initial lay-in of depot maintenance equipment for support of introduced weapons
     system.
     2.8.2. Military Construction (MILCON) projects.
     2.8.3. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) projects.
     2.8.4. Expense items (equipment sustainment).
     2.8.5. Any investment that supports non-DMAG activities or will not belong to DMAG
     activities.
     2.8.6. Any investment not in direct support of production (i.e., office furniture, passenger
     vehicles, etc.).
     2.8.7. Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE).
  2.9. The CPP project folders. The CPP monitor will initiate and maintain the CPP project
  folders as defined in AFMCI 21-109. As CPP projects are developed, critical information
  must be maintained in the CPP project folder, the official record for audit purposes. This
  information will be supplied to the 309 MXW Business Office (309 MXW/OB) CPP
  Manager on request. The group CPP monitor will provide required guidance, orientation,
  and assistance to project engineers during the requirements development phase. The project
  folder will be retained locally until transfer, turn-in, disposal or when the equipment is fully
  depreciated.
  2.10. An OO-ALC/FMC data sheet will be supplied to the engineers/project managers to
  assist in validating the potential requirements. The group CPP monitor will provide guidance
6                                                         309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010


    to the engineers/project managers and answer questions when they arise during the Economic
    Analysis (EA) creation and later as the project moves forward.
    2.11. Model Simulation Program should be used as a budgeting and prioritization tool as
    deemed necessary.
3. Documentation (Oct - Apr). The budget year requirements will be prepared and
processed in advance of the FY of funding. Advanced processing guidelines are as follows:
    3.1. The wing business office (309 MXW/OB) conducts a budget call meeting with CPP
    group point of contacts (POCs) (FY, 1st Quarter). Group POCs send a data call to engineers
    and planners for requirement investments who, in turn, complete a budget exhibit 9b, Capital
    Purchase Justification, to specifically answer what the current requirement is, its justification
    and the impact if not provided, and the 00-ALC/FMC data sheet. Return to group monitor
    (FY, 2d Quarter).
    3.2. Group monitors will submit completed packages, including MC, and OO-ALC/FMC
    data sheet through the Comprehensive Cost and Requirement System (CCaR). CPP group
    monitor will also provide, through CCaR, the group FY priority list and out year exhibit 9bs,
    and identify any next FY reprogramming of projects.                 Equipment requirement
    cancellation/changes in current year and budget year programs must be justified by changes
    in workload and/or economics. Since approval for these changes must be obtained from
    Headquarters AFMC, complete justification statements must be provided. Requests for
    cancellations/changes are to be approved at group level (2d Quarter).
    3.3. The 309 MXW/OB will forward the exhibit 9b and the OO-ALC/FMC data sheet to
    OO-ALC/FMC for EA/Cost Analysis (CA) development and certification. (FY, 2d Quarter).
    3.4. The OO-ALC/FMC will forward a copy of the certified EA to the group monitor to be
    included in the project folder and attached to the CCaR record.
    3.5. The 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager will consolidate the group CPP lists in preparation for
    the CPP Working Group Prioritization Meeting. The CPPWG must align and defend each
    requirement against the OO-ALC Long-term Depot Strategy Implementation Plan. The
    result of this meeting will be the OO-ALC prioritized list of CPP requirements for
    submission to the Production Board for approval.
    3.6. Ranking criteria has been established to help in the decision process. The following
    items are primary elements for ranking:
       3.6.1. Available CPP budget - funding level is established by level of depreciation.
           3.6.1.1. New mission.
           3.6.1.2. Sustainment of current mission.
           3.6.1.3. Cost.
           3.6.1.4. Quality.
           3.6.1.5. Schedule.
           3.6.1.6. Safety/Environment.
           3.6.1.7. Measurability.
309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  7


      3.6.2. Once the group has ranked their projects they will use the Strategic Linkage
      Scoring criteria to rank their projects for submission for the center CPP budget. The
      CPPWG will meet to set the priorities for the center budget submission. (FY, 3d Quarter).
4. Budget Processes:
   4.1. The 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager will consolidate all Budget Cycle Projects in CCaR.
   The prioritized list with the exhibit 9bs and EAs are required at least 2 months prior to the
   execution year before AFMC/Depot Modernization and Investments (A4DM) can authorize
   the funds release.
   4.2. The 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager will ensure aggregate program totals do not exceed
   the level of depreciation, existing and projected, the 309 MXW will actually earn for any
   budget-year, plus the projected authority from depot efficiencies unless appropriate HQ
   AFMC authorization has been granted.
   4.3. HQ Budget Calls. It is anticipated that HQ AFMC will initiate budget calls each April
   to match timing for input into the Program Objective Memorandum (POM).
5. Execution Processes:
   5.1. HQ AFMC Funding. Execution year documentation, i.e., exhibit 9bs and EAs, are
   required 2 months prior to the FY. Funds authorization is expected on 15 October of each
   year for the approved projects and 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager will notify group monitors
   when funds are available. Respective group CPP Monitors will notify appropriate project
   managers who will be ready to execute on receipt of funds.
   5.2. OO-ALC/PK Planning Meeting. The CPPWG will schedule an acquisition strategy
   meeting with 75 CONS/PK representatives at least 4 months prior to the FY and again 2
   months prior to the FY in order to finalize project specifications, initiate planning purchase
   requests for the approved President’s Budget, and determine sole source or competitive bid
   approaches. The organization responsible for the requirement will review the detailed
   checklist available at the 75 CONS/PK website for the appropriate requirement and will
   provide this information to OO-ALC/PK at this meeting.
   5.3. Group monitors will submit each project’s funding document, in CCaR, within 30 days
   of funding available, it will then be routed through Automated Business Services System
   (ABSS). CCaR and ABSS send feeds to each other so both are updated with each approval.
   The 309 MXW/OB approves document, enters Sponsor Order Number (SPON), Customer
   Order Number (CON), Job Order Number (JON), Plant Account Number (PAN) into
   DIFMS. The 75th Comptroller Squadron (75 CPTS/FMAS), certifies funding document,
   enters commitment into DIFMs and General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS).
   5.4. The OO-ALC/Cost Accounting has been appointed as the DIFMS OPR for fixed asset
   maintenance updates (i.e., contributed asset additions, asset deletions, etc.).
   5.5. The 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager will validate with the groups prior to Program Budget
   Review (PBR)/Budget Estimate Review (BER) that all projects can be executed. Should the
   situation require that projects be changed during the year of execution, the 309 MXW/OB
   CPP Manager will request reprogramming through HQ AFMC. This request (depending on
   dollar value/capability) may require approval at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
8                                                        309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010


    level and may or may not be approved. HQ AFMC/A4DM cannot authorize funding for
    reprogramming candidates without receiving completed EAs and exhibit 9bs.
    5.6. Purchase Request Creation. The group initiates, executes, and coordinates the
    procurement process and provides status as required to the 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager.
    For organic workload, the group requests a funds authorization from 309 MXW/OB. The
    309 MXW/OB then notifies the applicable group monitor that funds are available for use. In-
    house organic workload is delineated by Financial Job Order Number (FJON) in DIFMS.
    Example of FJON: FOG32A2G1000, underlined are special characters used to identify the
    workload as organic workload in support of a CPP project.
       5.6.1. Once the procurement package (i.e., statement of work (SOW), specs, drawings,
       sole source) is finalized and submitted to 75 CONS/PK, the group will enter funding
       information in CCaR and route for approval. After approval (funds certification, etc.),
       the monitor will fax/email this to the contracting agency if applicable.
       5.6.2. Once the purchase request is entered into CCaR, the coordination process begins.
       The Accounting Liaison Office (ALO) certifies the CPP documents in ABSS and records
       the commitment into DIFMS and General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS-R).
    5.7. Procurement Action. Once the purchase request is approved and funds certified,75
    CONS/PK solicits bids for contract. The CPPWG will meet with 75 CONS/PK quarterly and
    as required on contract status.
    5.8. Contract Award. Once the contract has been awarded, 75 CONS/PK notifies applicable
    group monitor or project manager that the contract has been awarded and provides a copy of
    the contract for the project file. The group monitor provides a copy of the contract to the 309
    MXW/OB CPP Manager.
    5.9. Obligations. Group monitor will track status of equipment buy to ensure obligation of
    funds – will meet or exceed the AFMC 80% standard by 30 Jun but no later than 30 Jul. HQ
    AFMC/A4DM recognizes this is dependent upon 1st quarter FY funds release and will
    advocate on behalf of OO-ALC if this is not achieved. This does not apply to 2d quarter or
    later reprogramming actions. All un-obligated funds as of 1 Aug are subject to redistribution
    at the Logistics Board Tier 2 discretion.
       5.9.1. Obligation of budget is accomplished using several mechanisms:
           5.9.1.1. Signed contract.
           5.9.1.2. DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR (Category I).
           5.9.1.3. Fund-Cite Letter (for indirect organic labor).
           5.9.1.4. Category II acceptance does not obligate funds.
    5.10. Reporting. The organization managing the project will supply obligation information
    and signed documentation, e.g., contract, and other tracking data to the 309 MXW/OB CPP
    Manager as the projects execute throughout the year. Progress reports are used to provide
    funds obligation status to management and HQ AFMC/A4DM; this information is reported to
    OSD quarterly.
    5.11. Accounting Reconciliation. The 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager and group POCs will
    use the DIFMS Online Report Viewer (OLRV) Construction in Progress 7310-512 report to
309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 9


  monitor equipment purchases, receipts, and payments of an asset. The manager will review
  each current year obligated project for un-obligated funds. HQ AFMC/A4DM will provide
  assistance to reconcile HQ managed requirements.
  5.12. Work complete/depreciation. The equipment custodian/manager, process engineer
  and/or group monitor will notify 309 MXW/OB of project acceptance and will notify Base
  Supply for the Custodian Account/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) and Air Force
  Equipment Management System (AFEMS) update. The group monitor will notify the CPP
  Manager via email with Control Symbol Number (CSN), project title, cost and description
  including date(s) that the investment is fully operational. Civil Engineers will provide minor
  construction information.
  5.13. The CPP project folders. Group CPP Monitors will update project folders to reflect
  execution year status and will supply this information to the 309 MXW/OB CPP Manager on
  request.
  5.14. Completion. After project completion 309 MXW/OB will take the following actions:
     5.14.1. Obtain Commander’s Resource Integration System (CRIS) Report to verify that
     funds have been expensed. If all funds have not been expensed, work with the project
     owner to resolve the issue.
     5.14.2. Close the JON in DIFMS.
     5.14.3. Update the Plant Account Record (PAR) in DIFMS so that depreciation can
     begin.
     5.14.4. Group monitor reviews OLRV fixed assets, 7310-501 report to verify equipment
     status and make updates as needed.
     5.14.5. Group monitor reviews OLRV monthly depreciation 7310-514 report to verify
     equipment status and make updates as needed.
     5.14.6. For update and research in DIFMS, fixed assets, use the following screens:
         5.14.6.1. The MS072P displays the data elements of a Plant Account Number (PAN)
         5.14.6.2. The MS071P displays the data elements of fixed assets JON.
         5.14.6.3. The MS053P displays budget amount.
         5.14.6.4. The MS036P option 4 displays contract number.
         5.14.6.5. The MS015P displays contract costs.
         5.14.6.6. The MS062P displays document number and JON.
         5.14.6.7. The process engineer notifies the analytical section in 309 MXSG, of
         accepted equipment for them to update Electronic Facilities Equipment Management
         System (EFEMS) and to establish a Preventative Maintenance (PM) number for
         maintenance and services.
         5.14.6.8. Inventory. Equipment custodians will complete annual inventory of
         equipment on the shop floor in accordance with AFMAN 23-110. These individuals
         will reconcile the stock number, serial number, acquisition cost, and
         operation/acquisition date for Working Capital Fund (WCF) general equipment listed
10                                                   309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010


          in both AFEMS with DIFMS and the equipment project folders, and correct current
          equipment data discrepancies. Identify AFEMS inconsistencies to the custodian for
          resolution. Equipment custodians will be responsible for reconciling folder
          information. These project folders will contain supporting data used to economically
          justify the project. They will use the Table 5.1 below.

          5.14.6.9. The project folder checklist will be placed on the inside cover of each
          project folder. According to the AFMCI 21-109, paragraph 2.8.3, the checklist must
          be annotated to include the date of each change to the folder contents and/or review
          that takes place. Items1-9 are mandatory for each equipment item. The requirements
          of section A should be maintained in addition to items 1-9. If any items on the list are
          not available after sufficient research, a memo for record must be in the folder
          explaining why the data is missing. Reviews of the project folder must be
          accomplished at intervals not to exceed 2 years to ensure folders contain the required
          documentation on the checklist. Newly purchased or contributed assets can be
          supported with an electronic project folder, posted to the CPP CoP,
          https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-CP-P0.
          5.14.6.10. The project folders are required on all equipment less than 10 years old.
          Once the equipment is fully depreciated, (usually 120 months), the folder is no longer
          required.
      5.14.7. The following procedures should be used for reconciling AFEMS and DIFMS:
          5.14.7.1. Once the DIFMS Financial Accounting (FA) plant account number is input
          to the AFEMS Capital Assets system in the contract number field, the reconciliation
          process will be as follows:
          5.14.7.2. The OO-ALC/FMRD FA POC ensures the DIFMS FA report is available
          by the 4th calendar day of the month being reconciled.
          5.14.7.3. The OO-ALC/FMRD FA POC will request AFEMS CFO Capital Assets
          report from AFMC A4 AFEMS POC by the 4th calendar day of the month being
          reconciled.
          5.14.7.4. The OO-ALC/FMRD FA POC will:
          5.14.7.5. Sort the DIFMS FA Report by the plant account number and the AFEMS
          CFO capital asset report by the contract number (DIFMS plant account number).
          5.14.7.6. Compare the DIFMS FA list to the AFEMS CFO Capital Asset list by
          checking for differences in, see Table 5.2
12                                                     309MXWI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2010

            6             Plant Account Number

           5.14.7.7. Any differences in the comparison on the six items above will be noted as
           follows:
           5.14.7.8. The OO-ALC/FMRD FA POC forwards any discrepancies to the
           designated         309 MXW group equipment managers for explanation and/or
           corrective action.
           5.14.7.9. The309 MXW group equipment managers will:
           5.14.7.10. Research items 1 through 6 and determine the necessary corrective action.
           5.14.7.11. Determine whether the equipment records need to be corrected in
           AFEMS, DIFMS or both.
           5.14.7.12. Prepare the proper data for corrective action of the accounting records in
           one or both systems.
           5.14.7.13. Send the prepared data to the DIFMS and/or AFEMS POC for processing.
           5.14.7.14. Follow up via email to ensure the forms are processed in a timely manner.
           5.14.7.15. Equipment monitors will send the corrections to OO-ALC/FMRD. The
           OO-ALC/FMRD FA POC processes the correction requests in DIFMS then sends a
           confirmation e-mail and documentation to the 309 MXW group equipment managers.
           5.14.7.16. Equipment monitors will send the corrections to 75 LRS/LGRM. The
           75LRS/LGRM personnel process the correction request in AFEMS then send a
           confirmation e-mail and documentation to the 309 MXW group equipment managers.
        5.14.8. Please note:
           5.14.8.1. Until corrective action is taken, any un-reconciled items will continue to
           appear on the quarterly reconciliation list of discrepancies.
           5.14.8.2. If un-reconciled items are not corrected in a timely manner, the 309 MXW
           group equipment managers, DIFMS FA POC and AFEMS POC will coordinate and
           prepare a report explaining why the discrepancies cannot be eliminated and forward
           to the appropriate supervisors for guidance.
