SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change updates the opening paragraph. It also updates the office title from
Customer Services to Academic Scheduling and Customer Services Division. A margin bar (|)
indicates revisions from the previous edition.
1. Priority. Cadet instructional facilities will be allocated following this priority system:
   1.1. Regularly Scheduled Cadet Instruction. Academic Scheduling and Customer Service
   (HQ USAFA/DFRR) schedules rooms for these programs.           Department scheduling
 2                                                           USAFAI36-3505 29 MARCH 2005


     coordinators should consolidate departmental requests and tell HQ USAFA/DFRR when they
     review the Preliminary Course Offering Information (PCOI) in mid-March for the following
     fall semester and mid-October for the following spring semester. HQ USAFA/DFRR will
     honor all requests for normal size (20-seat) classrooms for cadet instruction. Allocating a
     limited number of special classrooms (76-seat lectinars, 46-seat mini-lectinars, and seminar
     rooms) depends on the demand each semester. Final allocation of these classrooms may
     have to be delayed until actual enrollments by hour are known (1 to 2 weeks prior to the
     beginning of each semester). If the demand for special classrooms exceeds supply, the
     following priorities will be followed:
        1.1.1. Bona fide requirement. (Send HQ USAFA/DFRR a memorandum of justification
        with this request.)
        1.1.2. Largest number of cadets affected.
        1.1.3. Date of request.
     1.2. Other Cadet Instruction. (NOTE: HQ USAFA/DFRR will try to equitably distribute all
     available classroom resources among departments.)
     1.3. USAF Academy Sponsored Events.
     1.4. USAF and Other Department of Defense (DOD) Sponsored Events. (These events are
     occasionally directed by higher authority and will be assigned priority accordingly.)
     1.5. Cadet Activities.
     1.6. Non-DOD Sponsored Events.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. HQ USAFA/DFRR schedules all classrooms, lectinars, mini-lectinars, and seminar
     rooms in Fairchild Hall and classrooms and labs in Fairchild Hall East Annex.
     2.2. Headquarters, United States Air Force Academy, Center for Education and Technology
     (HQ USAFA/DFET) schedules all lecture halls in Fairchild Hall.
     2.3. The Head of the Department of Physical Education (HQ USAFA/ADP) controls cadet
     instructional facilities in the field house and cadet gymnasium.
     2.4. The Military Training Branch (HQ USAFA/CWT) coordinates with HQ USAFA/DFRR
     to schedule classrooms during the Commandant’s time.
3. Information Collections, Records, and Forms or Information Management Tools
(IMT).
     3.1. Information Collections. No information collections are created by this publication.
     3.2. Records. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
     publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
     Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
     Disposition             Schedule             (RDS)            located             at
