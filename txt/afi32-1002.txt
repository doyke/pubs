                                            Chapter 1

                                     KEY INSTRUCTIONS

1.1. Applying the Snow and Ice Control Plan (S&ICP).
     1.1.1. Ground Support. Installations with over 150 millimeters (6 inches) of average
     annual snowfall will maintain a snow and ice control plan (S&ICP) and form a snow and ice
     control committee (S&ICC). For installations which receive less than 150 millimeters (6
     inches) of average annual snowfall, the installation commander will create plans and
     committees to meet their specific needs.
     1.1.2. Aircraft Support. Specific anti-icing/deicing procedures for aircraft maintenance are
     maintained in the technical orders (TO) for each type of aircraft. A forum similar to the
     S&ICC should be used to coordinate the aircraft anti-icing/deicing program. Note: Aircraft
     anti-icing/deicing agents and general procedures are listed in TO 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing,
     Deicing and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft.
1.2. Snow and Ice Control (S&IC) Objective. Begin runway S&IC operations removal just
prior to, or at the onset of, snowfall or icing conditions to provide continuous bare pavement.
Installations without a flying mission will establish when S&IC operations should begin
according to mission requirements. The snow control center (SCC), command post, airfield
management (AM), and control tower must maintain close communications at all times.
1.3. Supporting the Mission. Maintain continuous mission capability by removing snow and
ice from airfield and base pavements. Judge the success of the program by the safe movement of
aircraft and vehicles during inclement winter weather.
1.4. Prioritizing Snow Removal. S&IC from all paved surfaces typically cannot be
accomplished simultaneously; therefore, three priorities are established to ensure S&IC
operations are accomplished in order of relative mission importance and publicized to avoid
misunderstandings among base agencies. Priorities can be changed when directed by the S&ICC
chair, in the best interest of flight safety and/or airfield mission requirements. Joint basing
priorities will be determined during the S&ICC meeting. Maps will be color-coded in the
following manner: Priority 1: red; Priority 2: yellow; Priority 3: green. For safe operation of
vehicles and equipment, establish a primary access route to and from the airfield. Establish
priorities in accordance with the following guidelines (Note: Priority areas may be different for
those bases without an active airfield. Joint base operations will comply with this instruction as
much as possible, taking into account multiple missions and/or runways. The S&ICP should be
flexible to allow for separate mission operations.):
     1.4.1. Priority 1 (Red):
        1.4.1.1. Primary active runways (overruns, when used for operations).
        1.4.1.2. Primary runway accesses to taxiways and alert facilities.
        1.4.1.3. Apron accesses to taxiways.
        1.4.1.4. Aircraft crash/fire equipment lanes.
AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   5


       1.4.1.5. Access roads to special weapons, ammunition storage, refueling points, and
       other primary mission facilities.
       1.4.1.6. For safe operations, establish navigational aids (NAVAIDS) for the primary
       instrument runway and primary access routes to and from the runway and to emergency
       facilities, i.e., hospital, fire, and emergency services.
   1.4.2. Priority 2 (Yellow):
       1.4.2.1. Secondary runways, overruns, and taxiways.
       1.4.2.2. Aircraft parking aprons and remaining aircraft movement areas.
       1.4.2.3. Access roads to secondary mission facilities and primary base streets.
       1.4.2.4. Covers NAVAIDS for those runways not covered in Priority 1.
   1.4.3. Priority 3 (Green): All other areas, including military family housing. Privatized
   family housing (PFH) area S&IC obligations will be determined during the S&ICC meeting
   and will be in accordance with ground lease, operating agreement and other military family
   housing privatization (MFHP) transaction documents (TD).
1.5. Using References and Resources. All S&IC activities that affect the environment must
comply with AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality. Allowance Standard (AS) 464, Civil
Engineer – Operations Flight Support Equipment, and AS 010, Vehicles Owned by the United
States Air Force for Permanent Bases, help determine the type and amount of equipment
authorized for S&IC. Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular (FAA AC) 150/5200-
30C, Airport Winter Safety and Operations, and FAA AC 150/5220-20, Airport Snow and Ice
Control Equipment, use abrasives (sand) only in emergency conditions to improve traction on
airfield surfaces. Guidance on pollution prevention/best management practices (P2/BMP) is
available from USAF/A7CAN. If possible, S&IC vehicle operators should review the ―Snow and
Ice Control Techniques‖ training available at the AFCESA Civil Engineer Virtual Learning
Center (VLC): https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil. Installations that receive more than 900 millimeters
(36 inches) of average annual snowfall, as stated in the surface observation climatic summary
maintained by the base weather station (for the entire reporting period), will earn a manpower
variance for S&IC (see Air Force manpower standard [AFMS] 44E0, Operations Flight). Use
this earned manpower to hire extra workers. Installations may also use service contracts to
augment their snow removal team, as approved by the BCE.

     involving airfield anti-icing/deicing agents.
     2.1.2. The Civil Engineer (USAF/A7C):
        2.1.2.1. Maintains overall responsibility for airfield anti-icing/deicing and assigns
        operational management responsibilities to the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency
        (AFCESA).
        2.1.2.2. Advocates for airfield anti-icing/deicing program funding requirements through
        the planning, programming, and budgeting system (PPBS) process.
     2.1.3. Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA):
        2.1.3.1. Recommends procedures for administering the S&ICP for the Air Force.
        2.1.3.2. Assists USAF/A7C to develop and test new deicing technologies.
        2.1.3.3. Provides technical assistance to the MAJCOMs and keeps them informed of new
        deicing technologies.
        2.1.3.4. Responsible for providing all airfield anti-icing/deicing and S&IC information,
        including updated copies of all references in this instruction (e.g., TOs, AFPDs, FAA
        guidance, authorized deicing chemicals) on the Civil Engineer Snow and Ice Control
        Community of Practice (CoP):
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-MS-CE-50.
     2.1.4. MAJCOMs.
        2.1.4.1. MAJCOMs review Air Force installation and non-Air Force requests for use of
        particular airfield anti-icing/deicing agents. Forward requests to the MAJCOM for the
        affected aircraft, or if they are the Lead Command (for affected aircraft), forward the
        request to the appropriate Aircraft Single Manager (ASM). If a requested agent is not
        approved, MAJCOMs will forward the request to HAF/A7C or AFCESA for processing.
        MAJCOMs will send a coordinated response back to the base with approved memos for
        implementation at the S&ICC. Approved memos will be listed as attachments to the
        S&ICP. If a requested agent is not approved or an aircraft is not listed on the ASC
        Runway and Deicing CoP, MAJCOMs will forward the request to USAF/A7C or
        AFCESA/CEO for processing. ASMs are responsible for determining how anti-
        icing/deicing chemicals may affect their aircraft.
        2.1.4.2. Where an agent is approved by one ASM and disapproved by another ASM on
        the same installation, the host MAJCOM will take the lead and resolve the issue with the
        ASMs. MAJCOMs will forward requests for anti-icing/deicing chemicals to
        AFCESA/CEO for review and approval.
AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     7


     2.1.4.3. MAJCOMS validate, prioritize, and submit airfield anti-icing/deicing program
     funding requirements to USAF/A7C.
     2.1.4.4. MAJCOMs validate, prioritize, and submit airfield anti-icing/deicing capability
     needs to Air Force Material Command (AFMC).
  2.1.5. Installations.
     2.1.5.1. Snow and Ice Control Plan (S&ICP). Each installation will create an S&ICP
     in accordance with this instruction. The S&ICP will include procedures from this
     instruction but should be tailored to meet local needs. Attach snowfall history, equipment
     and attachment inventory, team composition, material and parts levels, and color-coded
     maps. The S&ICP should be reviewed annually and revised as necessary. The installation
     commander will give final approval to the base S&ICP. The service provider for S&IC
     operations will ensure adequate information is provided in the base S&ICP to effectively
     achieve mission requirements.
     2.1.5.2. Snow and Ice Control Committee (S&ICC) Members. Paragraph 2.2 lists the
     representatives who make up the S&ICC membership. Select additional representatives
     from major tenant organizations and PFH PO.
     2.1.5.3. Snow and Ice Control Committee (S&ICC) Meetings. Each installation is
     responsible for holding at least two S&ICC meetings each year. Conduct a pre-season
     meeting between 1 September and 15 October and a post-season meeting between 15
     April and 31 May. Installations which do not receive enough snow to warrant a physical
     meeting may elect to conduct the pre-season and post season meetings electronically. The
     S&ICC will review:
         2.1.5.3.1. Snow removal priorities.
         2.1.5.3.2. Organizational responsibilities.
         2.1.5.3.3. Problems encountered during the previous seasons.

         2.1.5.3.9. Chemical consumption and impacts on aircraft, airfield infrastructure, and
         the environment.
     2.1.5.4. Internal Working Group. The S&ICC may form an internal working group to
     coordinate details on issues not requiring approval by the entire S&ICC.
     2.1.5.5. Primary Aircraft Authorization. Before using any airfield anti-icing/deicing
     agents, the installation will obtain approval for their primary aircraft authorization (PAA)
     from the appropriate ASM(s), coordinated through AFCESA/CEOO. If there is more than
     one PAA at a particular installation, approval is required from each PAA ASM. Requests
 8                                                              AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011


        will be routed through the appropriate MAJCOM for review and action and the S&ICC
        will ensure that tenant aircraft are considered in the request.
     2.1.6. Non-Air-Force-Owned           Installations    (Other     Services,    Commercial,
     OCONUS). Units with aircraft based at non-Air-Force-owned installations will advise the
     MAJCOM of the airfield anti-icing/deicing agents being used (since the unit will not have
     any input as to the anti-icing/deicing agent being used). Unapproved deicing chemicals may
     have to be used at OCONUS non-Air-Force-owned installations.
     2.1.7. Weapon Systems Program Managers.
        2.1.7.1. Upon receipt of a MAJCOM request to use an airfield anti-icing/deicing agent,
        evaluate the impact of the desired/requested airfield anti-icing/deicing agents on the
        performance of systems for which they are responsible. Provide the requesting MAJCOM
        with a recommendation on the advisability of proceeding based on assessments of
        potential adverse impacts of the system’s operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness
        (OSS&E). The assessments should consider, at a minimum, adverse operational or

                 SNOW AND ICE CONTROL (S&IC) PREPARATIONS

3.1. Operator Readiness.
   3.1.1. Training. Give higher priority to training after winters with below-average snowfall.
   Provide the following:
      3.1.1.1. VLC training: https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil. Ensure each member of the S&IC
      team reviews the training course ―Snow and Ice Control Techniques‖ at least once prior
      to the beginning of the snow season. The service provider will ensure snow removal
      operators are adequately trained, the training is documented, and training is reviewed
      annually.
      3.1.1.2. Formal classroom lectures, discussion periods, and Web-based training.
      3.1.1.3. Provide hands-on operation training for all S&IC equipment. Perform practice
      runs with the equipment using typical operation scenarios. Substitute water for liquid
      deicers to reproduce realistic operations.
      3.1.1.4. Contracted operations must be familiar with the S&ICP and will follow the
      requirements of the specific S&ICP for the installation as approved by the BCE.
      3.1.1.5. Instruct all operators on effective and efficient anti-icing/deicing methods with
      minimal chemical use. Instruction must cover chemical usage issues, personal safety,
      P2/BMPs, environmental impact, and impact on aircraft, weapon systems, and airfield
      infrastructure.
      3.1.1.6. Tabletop exercises using miniature equipment on airdrome layouts to simulate
      operations and reduce training costs.
      3.1.1.7. Operator maintenance responsibilities, including fuel, fluid, supply locations,
      repair techniques, and heavy equipment maintenance reporting procedures.
      3.1.1.8. Instruct the operators on communication procedures and right-of-way
      information. Each operator must be trained on the procedures to follow if the radio signal
      is lost between the operator, snow control, the control tower, and the airfield snow
      removal lead.
      3.1.1.9. Details of the S&ICP, emphasizing the order of priorities.
      3.1.1.10. Conduct both a daytime and nighttime airfield and base familiarization tour,
      highlighting locations where problems are likely. The airfield and base familiarization
      tour should identify such obstructions as aircraft airfield lighting systems, aircraft
      arresting cables and recessed arresting systems, aircraft fuel hydrant and valve pits, fire
      hydrants, railroad crossings, utility holes, curb and gutter systems, and any other
      obstructions that may be covered and difficult to see during snow removal operations.
      3.1.1.11. Define the following information: duty location, duty hours, duty uniform, shift
      schedules, and notification procedures.
 14                                                            AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011


       3.1.1.12. Permit attendance at technology-sharing seminars and workshops with other
       military bases and governmental agencies (e.g., Snow Symposium in Buffalo, New
       York).
   3.1.2. Safety and Health.
       3.1.2.1. Units must comply with all vehicle licensing, personal protective equipment, and
       medical requirement policies. All equipment operators, military or civilian, must meet
       minimum training requirements before licensing. Employ over-hires early enough to
       allow time for medical clearance examinations and operator training.
       3.1.2.2. S&IC operations and working conditions are hazardous. Anticipate damage to
       snow equipment and attachments due to hidden obstructions; damage can be minimized
       by educating operators ahead of time on these hidden hazards. Ensure all personnel
       comply with established safety procedures when operating deicing equipment.
3.2. Snow Removal Readiness. All equipment must be mechanically sound and operational by
1 September. Equipment status must be available for the pre-season meeting. Heated storage
facilities should be used to increase equipment life, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure rapid
response.
   3.2.1. Perform pre-season operational checks, including practice runs that resemble real
   winter operations as closely as possible. Report all discrepancies to logistics (vehicle
   maintenance) for corrective actions.
   3.2.2. Install, inspect, and perform operational tests on all snow control radios.
   3.2.3. Conduct run-up and operational checks when the temperature drops below freezing.
   3.2.4. Adjust and calibrate all S&IC equipment attachments. Load ballast and install tire
   chains (if necessary) prior to S&IC operations.
   3.2.5. Equip each unit with required support materials such as shovels, shear pins, ice
   scrapers, fire extinguisher, and tool kits as required.
   3.2.6. Use wear-resistant tungsten carbide cutting edges to reduce maintenance. CAUTION:
   Tungsten carbide cutting edges may be incompatible with some in-pavement lighting
   fixtures.
   3.2.7. Use broom cores with steel or poly bristles, or a combination of both. CAUTION:
   Loss of steel bristles increases foreign object damage (FOD) potential, so minimize loss by
   trying various brands and storing snow brooms indoors. It is not necessary or cost-effective
   to replace steel bristles with poly bristles until after they are worn down. Magnetic sweepers
   should be used to remove steel bristle residue from the airfield.
   3.2.8. Place vehicle call signs, airfield and base maps, snow removal priorities, operator
   manuals, and/or spreader settings in the equipment for the operator’s reference.
3.3. Obtaining Materials and Parts. The heavy repair superintendent procures adequate shop
stocks of S&IC supplies by 15 September each year. Establish minimum levels for each item,
arrange for on-call items, and identify shortages by 31 May each year.
AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011                                                                    15


3.4. Protecting Air Force Property. The heavy repair superintendent specifies "safety zones"
around key assets and includes this information in the S&ICP. Snow removal vehicles will not
operate within these safety zones.
   3.4.1. Environment. The heavy repair superintendent works cooperatively with the asset
   management flight chief to ensure applications of anti-icing/deicing agents are in accordance
   with local, state, and Clean Water Act (CWA) SW provisions. The military family housing
   privatization project owner (MFHP PO) must comply with all applicable laws including
   CWA SW provisions. The Air Force assumes no enforcement or supervisory responsibilities.
   The MFHP PO shall be liable for all costs associated with compliance.
   3.4.2. Infrastructure. Infrastructure crews mark all obstructions that could damage or be
   damaged by S&IC equipment. During the pre-season inspection, emphasis must be placed on
   marking drainage culverts, catch basins, manhole covers, fire hydrants, airfield lighting,
   electrical/electronic equipment enclosures, parking lot edges, curbs, and roadway drop-offs.
   3.4.3. Airfield Lighting. Non-metal markers may be used to identify taxiway lights. FAA
   AC 150/5345-53C, Airport Lighting Equipment Certification Program, provides the name
   and address of marker manufacturers (these manufacturers do not supply markers suitable for
   identifying taxiway lights buried in snow). If you experience excessive damage to in-
   pavement taxiway lights, consider purchasing "snowplow-resistant" lighting. Also watch for
   corrosion and deterioration of underground cables that may result from long-term or
   excessive use of non-urea ice control chemicals.
   3.4.4. Facilities. S&IC equipment operators will maintain sufficient clearance around
   facilities to prevent damaging the facility and/or snow removal equipment. Operators will
   observe the safe clearance distances as specified in the installation’s S&ICP.
3.5. Streamlining Operations. Civil engineer personnel should be aware of snow removal
physical constraints. Bumper blocks, elevated utility manholes in pavements, congested or
enclosed parking arrangements, lack of road shoulders, and dead-end or cul-de-sac streets can
severely hamper operations. Minimize these adverse conditions through continuous and
coordinated communication. The programs flight chief and chief of the project management
element shall coordinate maintainability checklists and drawings for upcoming projects with
operations flight S&IC equipment operators.
3.6. S&IC Monitoring Systems.
   3.6.1. Reviewing Runway Ice Detection Systems (RIDS).
       3.6.1.1. Using Sensors. Sensors embedded in the pavement measure surface conditions.
       These devices precisely measure the pavement temperature, indicate the presence of
       water or ice, and provide information to choose the most appropriate S&IC strategy.
       3.6.1.2. Influencing Factors. Many factors influence the formation of ice on
       pavements, including pavement temperature, surface color and composition, wind,
       humidity, solar radiation, traffic, and residual deicing chemicals. Air temperature is not
       an accurate gauge of pavement surface conditions. Knowing the direction and rate of
       change of pavement temperature can predict ice formation. Sensors are particularly
       valuable in timing anti-icing applications of chemicals. As ice or compacted snow
       accumulates on the pavement, knowing the pavement temperature and anti-icing/deicing
 16                                                           AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011


      chemical factors allows the SCC to determine what method will be most effective with
      the least amount of material.
      3.6.1.3. Pre-season Checks. Check systems before the season starts to make sure that
      routine maintenance was done and that systems work. Replace all required filters and
      clean the sensor pins.
   3.6.2. Mobile Pavement Temperature Sensors. There are several different models of
   mobile temperature sensors used for ice control. Some instruments mount to the underside of
   the vehicle and scan the pavement as the vehicle passes over it. Another model can be
   mounted to the mirror bracket and gives both pavement and outside air temperatures. These
   systems are equipped with a dash-mounted light-emitting diode (LED) display presenting
   continuous readings of the surrounding conditions.
3.7. Establishing the Snow Control Center (SCC). The SCC is a focal point for all S&IC
activities. Equip the SCC with:
   3.7.1. At least two class ―A‖ telephone extensions for calling snow removal personnel.
   3.7.2. At least one radio transceiver or remote. A dedicated net channel should be
   established for snow removal communications, when possible.
   3.7.3. Dispatch boards displaying the nomenclature, vehicle registration numbers, operator,
   vehicle status, radio call sign, vehicle’s dispatched location, and any comments.
   3.7.4. Airfield and main base maps with color-coded priorities, status, and runway surface
   conditions.
   3.7.5. All required publications, including this instruction and the S&ICP.
   3.7.6. Personnel rosters showing duty status and recall information.
   3.7.7. Charts identifying current weather conditions and the forecast.
   3.7.8. Alternate sources of equipment and personnel to support contingencies. Include
   instructions for renting equipment or Department of Defense (DOD) mutual support
   agreements with regional active or reserve units.

                       SNOW AND ICE CONTROL OPERATIONS

4.1. Snow Removal Procedures.
   4.1.1. Basic Guidelines. When snow removal conditions warrant SCC activation, the heavy
   repair superintendent will assume control authority for snow control operations for both the
   airfield and main base. The severity of the snowstorm determines the size of the area on
   which they will focus. Follow these general guidelines:
      4.1.1.1. Reduce operations and concentrate on keeping the center of the runway and
      taxiways clear when snow accumulation prevents clearing the entire area.
      4.1.1.2. Use snowplows in tandem to move snow into windrows. Snow blowers can be
      used to cast windrowed snow over the edge lights. Include the overruns with the runway
      plow patterns; as a rule, unless required for runway operations, overruns will not be
      cleared before primary taxiways.
      4.1.1.3. Clear enough area to leave room for clearance by aircraft wings and engines.
      Base aircraft should be used to determine permissible snow depth beyond the shoulders
      of the runways/taxiways.
      4.1.1.4. Glide slope critical areas require specific snow depths to prevent signal loss.
      Reduce profile height to help in future operations. Keep runway and taxiway lights
      uncovered.
      4.1.1.5. Snow windrow heights should be kept to a minimum to prevent interference with
      aircraft operating on the flightline. Snow removal operators should keep windrow heights
      to a minimum and ensure sufficient clearance is maintained between the distances of the
      runway edges, taxiways, and parking aprons to ensure aircraft will not be affected by
      snow obstruction.
   4.1.2. Maintaining Communications. All personnel operating in the controlled movement
   area will maintain two-way radio communication with the control tower. Radios equipped
   with headsets may be used to offset the high noise levels generated by snow removal
   equipment. Control tower requests to clear off the runway must allow enough time for the
   snow team supervisor to physically check the entire runway. The S&ICP must outline
   specific procedures when the radio signal is lost between the control tower and a snow
   removal vehicle operator. All operators must be trained in these specific procedures.
   4.1.3. Determining Right-of-Way. Some snow removal equipment operates at high speeds
   and will not comply with normal airfield/flight-line speed limits. Vehicles not actively
   involved in snow removal operations will yield the right-of-way to snow removal equipment.
   4.1.4. Following General Procedures. While conditions at individual bases vary widely
   and may require special S&IC techniques and equipment, follow general procedures as
   closely as possible. Wind speed and direction will determine the actual runway clearing
   pattern. For normal operations:
      4.1.4.1. When possible, start at the center of the runway and work outward to the
      shoulders.
18                                                           AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011


     4.1.4.2. Use snow brooms throughout the snowfall to clear the middle of the runway
     down to bare pavement, regardless of the rate of snowfall.
     4.1.4.3. Broaden snow removal efforts to include the entire primary runway during light-
     to-moderate snowfall. Use displacement plows and snow blowers to remove the
     windrows accumulated by the sweepers.
     4.1.4.4. Concentrate all efforts on keeping the center portion of the runway clear during
     heavy snowfalls. Note: Do not overlap longitudinal joints at the pavement crown. Use
     minimal down pressure when operating under-body scrapers to prevent the peeling of
     joint material and creating spall damage.
  4.1.5. Managing Vehicle Flow. Equipment operating in snow removal operations must
  maintain a safe working distance between vehicles to avoid possible collisions due to loss of
  view.
     4.1.5.1. Equipment movements must be timed for an orderly turnaround and safe reentry
     at the start of each pass.
     4.1.5.2. Unnecessary radio traffic must be reduced on the snow control frequency during
     runway snow removal operations. Snow removal transmissions will have priority on a
     multiple-user net.
  4.1.6. Crosswind Operating Conditions.
     4.1.6.1. Begin clearing the snow from the upwind side of the runway.
     4.1.6.2. The wind will help move the snow across the runway if time and aircraft
     operations permit. After beginning the clearing pattern, continue it for the entire width of
     the runway to avoid obscuring the runway centerline or leaving a windrow on the
     runway.
     4.1.6.3. Advise the control tower and AM personnel before beginning crosswind snow
     removal operations.
     4.1.6.4. Inform the control tower of any hazards such as windrows, snow banks, and
     slush if clearing operations must be stopped before finishing the entire runway width.
  4.1.7. Runway Edge Lights. Keep runway edge lights clear to give runway clearance for
  aircraft movements.
  4.1.8. Semi-Flush, In-Pavement Lights. Operators should be careful when operating a
  snowplow over these lights. Adjust blade height to clear the lights. When possible, use
  snowplows equipped with polymer or rubber blades or a snow broom. Polymer blades may
  reduce collateral damage but are not economical for all plowing conditions.
  4.1.9. Aircraft Arresting Systems (AAS) Area. Prior to starting snow-clearing operations,
  personnel will deactivate AAS and remove the pendant and barrier. Remove enough snow to
  allow full use of the AAS. Include specific techniques in the S&ICP. Use portable snow-
  blowing equipment and manual labor around the AAS. Use AAS maintenance or augmentee
  personnel for this work.
  4.1.10. NAVAIDs Instrument Landing System (ILS) Area. Snow removal operations in
  the ILS area will be directed by AM. All snow removal personnel will be accompanied by at
AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011                                                                      19


   least one NAVAIDS maintenance individual that monitors and ensures adequate snow
   removal in the antenna and field detector areas. Include specific procedures in the S&ICP for
   snow removal around NAVAIDS.
   4.1.11. Facility Managers. Facility managers or OPR are tasked with clearing snow from
   around their facility using shovels, small rotary blowers, or small tractor-mounted plows.
   This includes removing snow from areas around aircraft hangars and shelters, grounding
   points, parked aircraft (within defined safety zone), NAVAIDs, AAS building, and other
   areas that cannot safely be cleared using larger snow removal equipment. Facility managers
   are responsible for clearing snow from nearby fire hydrants and the faces of all facility signs.
   Facility managers will use only approved deicing chemicals near the airfield.
   4.1.12. Bulk Snow Removal. If there is insufficient space for storing snow near areas to be
   cleared, hauling to a disposal site may be necessary. If deemed necessary, the disposal site
   should be selected before winter sets in and identified in the S&ICP. The selection process
   should consider the following as a minimum: (1) disposal sites do not compromise aircraft
   operations, aircraft NAVAIDS, and flight-line traffic; (2) sites have adequate drainage
   capability; and (3) sites offer, if required, environmental mitigation of captured chemicals.
   MFHP PO or OPR is tasked with clearing snow from roads, streets, sidewalks and common
   areas in accordance with the MFHPTD. PO will use only approved deicing chemicals near
   the airfield.
   4.1.13. Temporary Airfield Markings. Where white markings do not provide the required
   contrast (i.e., snow-covered surfaces), a colored dye such as sea-marker dye (yellow-green or
   yellow-orange) must be used. The AFM will specify where to put the markings.
4.2. Airfield Ice Control. The BCE will select individuals in the S&IC chain of command to
make airfield pavement deicing decisions. Selection will be based on duty position, experience,
and environmental awareness. The decision to use ice control chemicals will be based on the
weather forecast, flying schedule, and environmental considerations. The SCC should carefully
monitor both use and issue of ice control chemicals and log the quantities and locations used.
Refer to paragraph 5.4.
   4.2.1. Knowing How Ice Forms. S&IC teams must know the various conditions that cause
   ice to form. Freezing rain, frozen water vapor and fog, freezing surface water, compacted
   snow, and the thawing and re-freezing of snow may all lead to hazardous pavement surfaces.
   Do not use chemicals during the early stages of dry snowfall or while snow is blowing since
   the melting ability of these chemicals may actually increase ice formation.
   4.2.2. Mechanically Controlling Ice. Using S&IC monitoring systems, anti-icing methods,
   and the "bare pavement" concept for the runway should minimize ice accumulation. When
   ice forms:
       4.2.2.1. Use under-body scrapers or graders for scraping ice to less than 3.2 millimeters
       (0.125 inch) before using deicing chemicals. Minimal down pressure should be used
       when operating under-body scrapers to minimize the peeling of joint material and spall
       damage.
       4.2.2.2. Remove slush or soft ice with rubber cutting edges.
20                                                             AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011


     4.2.2.3. Use serrated cutting edges to cut longitudinal grooves in hard ice to help hold
     chemicals and improve traffic control.
     4.2.2.4. Use caution with rotary snow brooms on hard-packed snow and ice. In some
     cases, the snow broom may glaze or "polish" the ice and further reduce traction. Steel
     snow broom bristles help cut ice; poly bristles are best for "flipping" snow.
  4.2.3. Ice-Control Chemicals. Use only installation-approved chemicals on the airfield for
  anti-icing/deicing. Consult your installation’s asset management flight chief to ensure
  products comply with all federal, state, and local environmental policies. Hazardous material
  purchases and accumulation of expired shelf life materials should be minimized. CAUTION:
  The National Stock Number (NSN) for ice control chemicals is a generic stock number
  encompassing all anti-icing/deicing chemicals. Installations must ensure all deicing
  chemicals are compatible when purchasing additional chemicals.
  4.2.4. Anti-icing/Deicing Chemicals Storage. Anti-icing/deicing chemicals should be
  stored in an enclosed shelter, if possible. A properly stored anti-icing/deicing chemical
  reduces product degradation caused by exposure to the weather. Storing solids or abrasives
  under shelter prevents moisture absorption that may freeze the stockpile in cold weather.
  Liquid ice-control chemicals stored in tanks must comply with AFI 32-7001, Environmental
  Management. Potassium acetate chemicals should be stored in polyethylene or stainless-steel
  tanks. Use of potassium acetate as an anti-icer is recommended as an excellent means of
  reducing total chemical usage (refer to paragraph 4.2.7 and paragraph A2.2.1).
  4.2.5. Environmental Impact. Minimize use of ice control chemicals to protect the
  environment, aircraft and weapon systems, and airfield infrastructure, weapon storage areas
  (WSA), missile alert and launch facilities, and to control the cost of airfield deicing activities.
     4.2.5.1. If available, use runway ice-detection systems and mobile temperature sensors
     so teams can use anti-icing techniques rather than deicing.
     4.2.5.2. Minimize use of glycols and urea-based products. Rely on alternative materials
     that are safer for the environment, such as potassium acetate, sodium formate, and
     sodium acetate. Excessive glycol and urea use could degrade waterways. CAUTION:
     Ensure potassium acetate is used as recommended by the manufacturer. There are
     documented cases of potassium acetate causing increased groundwater contamination and
     adversely effecting underground electrical circuits where the insulation is in poor
     condition (see Attachment 2).
     4.2.5.3. Some deicers may cause light scaling of Portland cement concrete (PCC) by
     physical action related to the chemical concentration gradient in the pavement. If it can
     be avoided, do not apply ice control chemicals to new PCC pavements for the first year.
  4.2.6. Dispensing Anti-icing/Deicing Chemicals.
     4.2.6.1. Solid Chemicals.
         4.2.6.1.1. Use a suitable dispenser. For uniform coverage on the airfield, material
         spreaders with capacities between 5 and 7 cubic yards are needed to accurately
         dispense chemicals. The dispenser must apply a uniform pattern at various density
         settings and speeds. Caution should be taken with some non-urea solids, such as
AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011                                                                    21


         sodium formate, which tend to form clumps; these should be applied with equipment
         designed to break up the clumps.
         4.2.6.1.2. Use solid chemical dispensers with pre-wetting capability when possible.
         Pre-wetting solid deicers with approved liquid deicers is much more effective at low
         temperatures and prevents the solid deicers from being blown away by high winds.
         The recommended application rate in pre-wetting is 10.4 liters per 1,000 kilograms
         (1.25 gallons per 1,000 pounds) of deicer.
         4.2.6.1.3. Use waterproof covers to prevent the chemical from absorbing moisture
         while in storage.
     4.2.6.2. Liquid Chemicals. Computer-controlled and -calibrated sprayer units should be
     used whenever possible to minimize chemical usage while maximizing the chemical's
     effect. Trucks equipped with tanks and spray bars can be used to dispense liquid
     chemicals. The spray bar and nozzles should cover well without runoff. Portable towed
     tanks and water distributors may also be used, but these will require flushing if used for
     multiple activities. Ensure spreaders are capable of accurately dispensing liquid
     chemicals while traveling at various speeds. Installations using large quantities of
     chemicals should consider procuring precision application equipment to improve the
     effectiveness and efficiency of the chemicals applied. Contact your MAJCOM for
     guidance on procuring airfield deicing chemical application equipment.
  4.2.7. Anti-Icing. Whenever possible, S&IC teams should emphasize anti-icing rather than
  deicing, especially on installations that have runway ice-detection systems. Direct the
  primary ice-control efforts toward keeping ice from bonding to pavements. Anti-icing
  requires applying liquid deicing chemicals at a rate of 1.2 liters per 100 square meters (0.3
  gallon per 1,000 square feet) just before freezing conditions occur. Chemicals in liquid form
  are most effective for anti-icing. Dry, solid chemicals applied to a cold, dry surface will not
  stick, and surface winds or aircraft may scatter it, severely reducing its effectiveness and
  impacting the environment. Solid chemicals may be used as an anti-icer, but must be used
  with a liquid to enhance the bonding action between the chemical and the pavement.
  4.2.8. Deicing. Deicing may require up to five times the quantity of chemical as anti-icing.
  After applying the deicer, the chemical must be allowed to react and take effect. After the
  chemical begins its brine action, remove the ice and snow with rotary snow brooms or
  snowplows.
  4.2.9. Abrasives. Use abrasives (sand) only in emergency conditions to improve traction on
  airfield surfaces. Excerpts from FAA AC 150/5200-30C for abrasives use is stated in
  paragraphs 4.2.9.1 and 4.2.9.2.
     4.2.9.1. All sands do not perform the same. In general, the greater the quantity of sand
     applied, the greater the increase in traction. Fine sands show superior performance on
     warmer ice (>20 Fahrenheit [°F] [-7 Celsius (°C)]), while coarser sands show superior
     performance on colder ice (<15 °F [-9 °C]). For the purpose of this guidance, sand
     retained on a #30 sieve is considered ―coarse,‖ and sand passing through a #30 sieve is
     considered ―fine.‖
     4.2.9.2. Table 4.1 provides the standard gradation for sand. Friction-improving material
     applied to airfield pavements will consist of washed granular particles free of stones,
 22                                                          AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011


       loam, clay debris, and chloride salts or other corrosive substances. The pH of the water
       solution containing the material must be approximately neutral (pH 7). Material must
       meet the following gradation using standard sieves conforming to American Society for
       Testing and Materials (ASTM) E11, Standard Specification for Woven Wire Test Sieve
       Cloth and Test Sieves.

Table 4.1. Standard Gradation for Sand.
Sieve Designation     Percent by Weight Passing
0.04                  100
8                     97–100
16                    30–60
50                    0–10
80                    0–2
       4.2.9.3. It is recommended that bases coordinate with their local airframe manager to
       ensure that the proper grade material is used for the aircraft at their installation.
   4.2.10. Grooving Pavement. Cutting grooves into the pavement is an option that will aid in
   trapping deicing chemicals, reducing loss, and prolonging the melting action. Grooving also
   helps drain melted water and reduce re-freezing.
4.3. Controlling Snow and Ice on Roadways, Parking Lots, Housing, and Other
Areas. Remove snow from these areas to allow normal base activity to proceed with minimum
delay. When possible, work during non-peak hours to avoid congestion. CAUTION: Agents not
authorized for use on runways must not be used on any roadways within 90 meters (300 feet) of
runways, taxiways, or parking aprons to prevent tracking these agents onto surfaces used by
aircraft. Note: All chemical agents used on roadways must conform to local environmental
standards. To ensure environmental compliance, coordinate with and obtain approval from the
asset management flight chief.
   4.3.1. Roads and Streets. Plow from the center of the road, pushing the windrow to the
   shoulder. In heavy-accumulation regions, use rotary snow blowers to clear shoulders and
   sidewalks.
   4.3.2. Parking Lots. The heavy repair superintendent, security forces, and facility managers
   will decide when and which parking lots will be closed for snow removal clearing. If
   required, the S&ICP should address the need for temporary parking areas. Use local media to
   publicize parking arrangements.
   4.3.3. Housing and Other Areas. The S&ICP will specify the snow removal
   responsibilities of the occupant and facility manager for sidewalks, entrances, fire hydrants,
   and loading ramps. The S&ICP will specify the snow removal responsibilities of the
   occupant, facility owner, and MFHP PO for sidewalks, entrances, fire hydrants, and loading
   ramps in accordance with the MFHPTD.
   4.3.4. Ice Control.
       4.3.4.1. Chemicals Use. All approved anti-icing/deicers should be used as little as
       possible. Chemicals should be properly stored to prevent contamination. Environmental
       contamination is most likely at storage sites. The organization storing mission-essential
AFI32-1002 19 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   23


     anti-icing/deicing chemicals will be responsible for the clean-up of any environmental
     contamination. Keep deicer chemicals dry to prevent ground or surface water
     contamination. Additional information concerning anti-icing/deicing chemicals is in
     Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Manual of Practice for an Effective Anti-icing
     Program, located at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/mopeap/mop0296a.htm#eap22.
     Use chlorides as follows:
        4.3.4.1.1. Use sodium chloride (rock salt) and calcium chloride to de-ice non-
        airdrome areas. Because they are corrosive, use them away from aircraft movement
        areas, WSA, and missile launch facilities.
        4.3.4.1.2. Use sodium chloride (with or without added liquid calcium chloride) to de-
        ice base areas; it is cheap and effective.
        4.3.4.1.3. Use calcium chloride instead of sodium chloride at lower temperatures.
        Pre-wetting will make it more effective. Use chloride-based deicers with corrosion
        inhibitors on bridges or other structures.
        4.3.4.1.4. Use magnesium chloride as an anti-icer or deicer. It is less toxic to plant
        life and less corrosive to concrete and steel (and other iron alloys) than sodium
        chloride. The use of magnesium chloride improves driving conditions during and
        after freezing precipitation, but may damage underground electrical systems.
     4.3.4.2. Abrasives. Use sand and cinders to increase vehicle traction. Add between 5
     and 15 percent chloride by weight to sand to improve traction and help melt ice.
     Abrasives may improve traction on icy pavements; however, heavy applications can
     insulate the ice and keep it from melting. It may also degrade air quality in windy
     locations and lead to drainage problems. Drainage inlets should be routinely cleared to
     avoid flooding when the ice and snow melt. Abrasives can degrade stream quality and
     exceed the total suspended solids (TSS) allowed to be discharged into streams and
     waterways; solids are the main cause of water pollution.
     4.3.4.3. Ethylene Glycol. Ethylene glycol will not be used for any deicing activities
     because of its highly toxic nature.
  4.3.5. Snow Removal Equipment.
     4.3.5.1. Main Base. Caution must be used when assigning airfield snow removal
     equipment to the main base and should be done only in emergencies. Use dump trucks
     with reversible plows, road graders, loaders with buckets or plows, deicing chemical
     dispensers, and attachments on other equipment to clear areas. This equipment should
     only be used during low-traffic periods and must be monitored closely.
     4.3.5.2. Snow Brooms. Snow brooms are prohibited from being used on base streets
     due to the size of the equipment and the danger of flying bristles. Additionally, there are
     numerous obstructions that cannot be seen due to limited operator visibility.
     4.3.5.3. Other Uses. Ideally, S&IC equipment should only be used for snow and ice
     removal. However, the BCE may authorize using snow removal equipment for non-S&IC
     activities, such as snow brooms for runway rubber-removal operations, as long as normal
     precautions are taken and the operation does not damage the snow removal equipment.

                                            Chapter 5

                                  POST-SEASON ACTIONS

5.1. Implementing Lessons Learned. The operations flight commander will review the
activity logs at the end of the snow season, determine the problems and successes, and
incorporate improvements into the revised S&ICP. Use P2/BMPs proactively to minimize or
eliminate problems. Begin preparations for the next snow removal season at the end of the
current season.
5.2. Reconditioning Snow Removal Equipment. At the end of the snow removal season, all
S&IC equipment must be scheduled for reconditioning in preparation for the next snow season.
The heavy repair superintendent, or designee, in conjunction with the logistics readiness
squadron (LRS), coordinates, thoroughly inspects, repairs, and stores all S&IC equipment
scheduled for reconditioning. Replacement parts should be identified and ordered immediately so
the equipment will be ready for the next snow season. The vehicle control officer or
noncommissioned officer (NCO) will brief the staff on the status of snow removal equipment at
the commander's update briefings.
5.3. Repairing Real Property. Complete normal end-of-season activities, such as storing snow
fence and snow markers. Inspect all pavement surfaces for damage caused by snow removal
equipment. An evaluation of the airfield lighting, AAS, base signs, grounds, and security fences
should be conducted for possible damage. Schedule repairs based on local priorities.
5.4. Tracking Chemical Consumption. Each installation is responsible for tracking the
consumption of deicing chemicals and abrasives used on their airfields, streets, parking lots, and
sidewalks. Airfield and street consumption should be accounted for separately. This information
should be available at all times for use by the asset management flight chief, MAJCOM, or
higher agencies. The following information is required when collecting this data:
   5.4.1. Each type of deicer and/or abrasive used.
   5.4.2. Quantity of each deicer and/or abrasive used.
   5.4.3. Unit of issue.
   5.4.4. Unit price.
   5.4.5. Method of procurement.
   5.4.6. Total inches of snowfall for the past winter.
   5.4.7. Total number of ice events/storms.
   5.4.8. Total square yards of airfield.
   5.4.9. Total square yards of street and parking lot pavement.
   5.4.10. Total number of sorties flown.

          USING ICE CONTROL CHEMICALS ON AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS

A2.1. Solid Anti-Icing and Deicing Chemicals. All solid chemicals for airfield use (other than
urea) must be certified to Society of Automotive Engineers Aerospace Material Specification
(SAE AMS) 1431C, Compound, Solid Runway and Taxiway Deicing/Anti-Icing.
   A2.1.1. Urea. Shotted or prilled urea performs well down to –9.4 °C (15 °F). Carefully
   monitor urea usage since overuse can lead to environmental degradation. See Table A2.1 for
   application rates. As an example, apply no more than 11.2 kilograms of urea per 100 square
   meters on ice less than 0.8 millimeter (0.03125 inch) thick when pavement temperature is –
   3.9 °C (25 °F).

                                          Pavement Temperature
     Ice Thickness
                            -1.1 °C (30 °F) -3.9 °C (25 °F) -6.7 °C (20 °F)
Less than 0.8 mm
                           7.8 (16)            11.2 (23)          29.3 (60)

                           14.6 (30)           29 (60)            61 (125)
(0.03125 in. to 0.125 in.)
3.2 mm to 6.4 mm (0.125
                           61 (125)            85.4 (175)         134 (275)
in. to 0.25 in.)
   A2.1.2. Sodium Formate. More environmentally friendly than urea, this product has been
   effective at temperatures as low as –15 °C (5 °F), with an application rate half that of urea. It
   requires 90 percent less oxygen than urea to biodegrade, making it far less polluting than
   urea. See Table A2.2 for application rates.

in. to 0.25 in.)
   A2.1.3. Sodium Acetate. Another more environmentally friendly product, sodium acetate
   will effectively melt ice at temperatures as low as –12.2 °C (10 °F). It requires 63 percent
   less oxygen than urea to biodegrade, making it far less polluting than urea. See Table A2.3
   for application rates.

in. to 0.25 in.)
A2.2. Liquid Anti-Icing and Deicing Chemicals. All liquid chemicals for airfield use (other
than isopropyl alcohol and propylene alcohol) must be certified to SAE AMS 1435B, 1435B,
Fluid, Generic, Deicing/Anti-Icing Runways and Taxiways. CAUTION: Do not allow any
mixing or blending of deicing products from different manufacturers in storage and dispensing
tanks. This could affect the chemistry of the originally certified products and the product would
then require re-testing to ensure it satisfies SAE AMS 1435B.
   A2.2.1. Potassium Acetate. Potassium acetate deicers conforming to required
   specifications are currently the most environmentally acceptable agents. However, potassium
   acetate may cause increased corrosion of certain aircraft and weapon system components and
   airfield infrastructure. Electrical conductivity is also a concern if potassium acetate is over-
   applied. It has been implicated as a contributing factor in electrical shorting of aircraft and
   airfield electrical systems.

in. to 0.25 in.)
Note: When freezing conditions are expected, potassium acetate may be used as
an anti-icer at the rate of 2 liters per 100 square meters (0.5 gallon per 1,000
square feet).
   A2.2.2. Ethylene Glycol. Ethylene glycol will not be used for any deicing activities
   because of its highly toxic nature.
