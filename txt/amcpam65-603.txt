The purpose of this pamphlet is to serve as a training guide strictly to assist financial analysts
and resource advisors at the AMC wings, groups, Numbered Air Force (NAF), direct reporting
units (DRU), geographically separated units (GSU), and headquarters function in locating the
proper authoritative or regulatory guidance on financial/budget policy and procedures, as well as
specific issues dealing with federal appropriations law. In most cases it is not directive in nature
for financial management policy purposes; that is the function of the applicable source document
or reference. It is the financial analyst‘s responsibility to be familiar with the source documents
referenced throughout the publication. This pamphlet will not necessarily address every topic or
issue that may arise. You will encounter funding policy circumstances that require interpretation
of Air Force and DoD policy as well as public law. This pamphlet is not designed for use by Air
National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. Any references to ANG
or AFRC in this pamphlet are strictly to clarify funding issues for AMC organizations and to
provide the applicable regulatory guidance. NOTE: HQ ANG/FMA and HQ AFRC/FMA have
previously coordinated on the AMC 65-series instructions, which provide the AMC regulatory
financial guidance (AMCI 65-602, Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) Budget
Guidance and Procedures, and AMC Supplement 1 (AMCS1) to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget
Guidance and Procedures) pertaining to them where referenced in this pamphlet. See
Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting information.

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose and Scope. This publication contains funding guidance and consolidates most
financial management and budget guidance for AMC financial managers. The provisions of
these instructions apply to all AMC activities that are issued AMC funds. This publication is
designed for use as a training guide to assist users in locating the proper authoritative or
regulatory guidance concerning funding issues.
1.2. Policy Guidance. Answers to most Air Force financial management policy questions are
found in the 65-series of Air Force Instructions (AFI). These publications provide general policy
on financial issues; however, they do not necessarily address financial policy on every
circumstance that may arise. Interpretation of Air Force and DoD policies, as well as public law,
are necessary in many cases which often requires common sense and a general knowledge of Air
Force directives, appropriations law, and United States Codes. If you are unable to resolve a
financial management policy issue after researching all applicable guidance and need MAJCOM
assistance, contact HQ AMC/FMAO, Attn: Budget Policy and Procedures, 402 Scott Drive, Unit
1K1, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5311. Provide detailed background information (who, what, where,
when, why, how) to support your question. If we cannot provide the appropriate response, we
will forward the issue to SAF/FMBMM (Policy and Fiscal Control) for resolution.
1.3. Distribution. This publication is available on the HQ AMC/FM Budget Policy CoP web site at the
following address: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AM-FM-BH-01.
Select the AMCPAM 65-603 publication link from the ―AMC Policy Guidance‖ tab, located under
―Action Items.‖ You may download the publication at any time and reproduce in sufficient copies to
allow distribution to local financial managers, as determined by the local Comptroller. AMCPAM 65-603
is also available on the e-Publishing web site, located at the following address: .
1.4. Updates. HQ AMC/FMA will provide revisions through interim changes (ICs), as
appropriate, and will make them available via the HQ AMC/FM web site in paragraph 1.3
above. Submit suggestions for updates at any time to the address in paragraph 1.2 above, using
Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Please be specific as to
the purpose of your suggestion and provide as much detailed information as possible, including
the benefits derived from the proposed change.

                                            Chapter 2

                  GENERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS

2.1. Introduction. Financial management is a function of command. All commanders are
challenged with maximizing military capability and accomplishing its Air Force mission within a
limited level of funding. Toward that end, responsibility for financial management is delegated
to, and incumbent upon, each and every manager. Financial managers should test each proposed
use of resources for contribution to the mission, evaluate against other alternatives, and consider
against the total size of the budget. These decisions are often difficult and require the expertise
and involvement of all echelons of management.
2.2. Statement of Financial Management Policy.
   2.2.1. Each Air Force commander and manager is responsible for the effective, efficient, and
   economical use of all resources made available to their organization. The use of all resources
   at operating locations is either directly controllable or influenced by commanders and
   managers.
   2.2.2. There are positive means for a manager to directly influence the effective utilization of
   all resources to accomplish assigned missions. Each manager assists in the budget
   formulation and resource allocation by recommending the best mix of resources to secure the
   most efficient use of the available resources. Financial managers should take an active part in
   the formulation and execution of operating budgets through participatory financial
   management.
   2.2.3. Financial management includes the use of resource advisors (RAs) and a working
   committee structure to advise and assist the commander in the financial decision making
   process. The local comptroller assists the managers by assuring the fiduciary accounting and
   control of obligations and provides interpretation of obligation data through the accounting
   system.
   2.2.4. Financial managers must have timely and reliable obligation and expense data to
   monitor the availability of funds. Accounting data is important because this is the basis for
   measuring performance of the organization. Relating expenses to production for a given
   period tells a manager how well the manager has done compared to a standard or to past
   activity.
   2.2.5. There are a variety of factors that influence management, but the most important
   factor is the proper use of public funds. Everyone who manages funds appropriated from
   Congress must adhere to the Antideficiency Act, addressed in the following paragraph.
2.3. Antideficiency Act (ADA).
   2.3.1. Purpose. The ADA is primarily codified as Public Law (PL) in 31 U.S.C., Sections
   1341, 1342, and 1517 of the United States Code. The governing regulation for the Act is
   DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 14, Administrative Control of Funds and Antideficiency Act
   Violations. This regulation requires that no DoD official shall authorize or create any
   obligation or make any expenditure beyond the amount of funds currently available or
   permitted under any statutory limitation. Some examples of prohibitions or potential
   violations regarding this law are as follows:
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                      15


     2.3.1.1. Making or authorizing expenditures from, or creating or authorizing an
     obligation under, an appropriation or fund in excess of the amount available in the
     appropriation or fund unless authorized by law.
     2.3.1.2. Involving the government in any contract or other obligation for the payment of
     money for any purpose in advance of appropriations made for such purpose, unless law
     authorizes the contract or obligation.
     2.3.1.3. Accepting voluntary services for the United States, or employing personal
     services in excess of that authorized by law, except in cases of emergency involving the
     safety of human life or the protection of property.
     2.3.1.4. Making obligations or expenditures in excess of an apportionment or
     reapportionment, or in excess of the amount permitted by agency regulations.
     2.3.1.5. Incurring an obligation in an expired account for a contract change that exceeds
     $4 million in a fiscal year without prior written approval from the Office of the
     Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)). See paragraph 2.3.2.1 below.
     2.3.1.6. Incurring an obligation in an expired account for a contract change that exceeds
     $25 million in a fiscal year without requesting approval from Congress 30 days before the
     obligation is incurred. See paragraph 2.3.2.2 below.
  2.3.2. 31 U.S.C., Section 1551-1557 Application. This provides for the cancellation of
  appropriations after specified periods, extension of the expired status for appropriations from
  2 years to 5 years, and elimination of the merged accounts, as amended by Public Law 101-
  510. Under certain circumstances, a payment otherwise chargeable to a canceled account-
  both as to purpose and amount-except that the account has been canceled, can be paid from
  or charged to an appropriation that, at the time of payment, is available for incurring new
  obligations for the same purpose as the canceled account. The total of all such payments
  charged to a currently available appropriation may not exceed the lesser of (1) 1 percent of
  the total amount originally appropriated to the current appropriation being charged, (2) the
  unobligated balance of the currently available appropriation, and (3) the unobligated balance
  of the canceled appropriation (31 U.S.C., Sections 1552 and 1553(b)).
     2.3.2.1. Contract Changes Exceeding $4 Million. Under certain circumstances,
     obligations for contract changes exceeding $4 million in a fiscal year within a program,
     project, or activity of an appropriation require approval by OUSD(C) prior to incidence.
     See 31 U.S.C., Section 1553(c)(1).
     2.3.2.2. Contract Changes Exceeding $25 Million. Under certain circumstances,
     obligations for contract changes in expired accounts that exceed $25 million in a fiscal
     year within a program, project, or activity of an appropriation require submission to
     Congress for at least 30 days prior to being incurred. See 31 U.S.C., Section 1553(c)(2).
  2.3.3. Section 1004 of Public Law 102-484 permits, in certain circumstances, charging
  current appropriations when sufficient obligation authority does not exist in certain expired
  accounts. Amounts charged in these cases may not exceed 1 percent of the appropriation for
  the current available appropriation, or 1 percent of the appropriation of the expired account
  whichever is less.
16                                                             AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  2.3.4. Administrative Controls. The ADA requires the establishment and operation of a
  system of administrative controls over appropriations and other funds to regulate funding
  amounts, purposes, and timing. The system must also provide data on fund availability and
  allow determination of the individuals responsible for violations.
  2.3.5. Funding Control Responsibility. All personnel whose duties require them to distribute
  funds, certify fund availability, and commit or obligate funds are responsible for ensuring
  that sufficient funds are available in the appropriate account and administrative subdivision
  while performing their duties. Additionally, these individuals must be aware of and comply
  with any statutory limitations applicable to fund availability for specified purposes. Bottom
  line; do not make payments at some future time for goods or services unless there is enough
  money in the ―bank‖ to cover the cost in full. The ―bank‖ is the available appropriation,
  subdivided to various levels (apportionment and allocation) that can shrink the account at
  your level. If you do not have enough funds available at your level, even though there are
  enough funds at the MAJCOM level, for example, you may still have an ADA violation.
  Resolve any doubts or concerns about particular uses of funds before authorizing or incurring
  obligations. Whether funds are legally available for obligation or expenditure depends on
  three factors: (NOTE: All three elements must be observed).
     2.3.5.1. The purpose of the obligation or expenditure must be authorized.
     2.3.5.2. The obligation must occur within the time limits applicable to the appropriation.
     2.3.5.3. The obligation and expenditure must be within the amounts that Congress has
     established.
  2.3.6. Timely Recording of Obligations. Once incurred, account for all obligations and
  expenditures accurately and promptly, as supported by documentary evidence. Furthermore,
  record all obligations as of the date incurred, even if such action results in a negative amount
  in the accounting records that existed in a subsequent period identified and recorded during
  that period.
  2.3.7. Obligation or Expenditure in Excess or Advance of Appropriations. The two sets of
  prohibitions are (1) making expenditures or incurring obligations in excess of available
  appropriations and (2) making expenditures or incurring obligations in advance of
  appropriations. The following paragraphs provide further explanation.
  2.3.8. Exhaustion of an Appropriation. This refers to any of several different but related
  situations:
     2.3.8.1. Depletion of appropriation account (i.e., fully obligated or expended).
     2.3.8.2. Similar depletion of a maximum amount specifically earmarked in a more
     general lumpsum appropriation.
     2.3.8.3. Depletion of an amount subject to a monetary ceiling imposed by some other
     statute (usually, but not always the relevant program legislation).
  2.3.9. Contract or Other Obligations in Excess or Advance of Appropriations. For example,
  the ADA prohibits you from obligating $700,000 when you have only $350,000 left in the
  account, and prohibits you from entering into a contract in September, purporting to obligate
  next fiscal year's unappropriated funds, unless the contract includes the appropriate ―Subject
  to Availability of Funds‖ clause.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        17


  2.3.10. Indemnification.
     2.3.10.1. Prohibition against Unlimited Liability. Under an indemnification agreement,
     one party promises, in effect, to cover another party‘s losses. The basic rule is that, absent
     statutory authority, the government may not enter into an agreement to indemnify, where
     the amount of the government‘s liability is indefinite, indeterminate, or potentially
     unlimited. Such an agreement would not only violate the ADA, it would violate the
     Adequacy of Appropriations Act (41 U.S.C., Section 11) as well.
     2.3.10.2. Authorized Indemnification. Indemnification agreements may be proper only if
     limited to available appropriations and otherwise authorized, either expressly (to include
     specific authorization by law) or under the ―necessary expense‖ doctrine. Once the
     legality of the indemnification agreement is determined, it becomes necessary to address
     the unlimited liability issue. If the government‘s potential liability is limited and
     determinable, an agreement to indemnify is acceptable if it is otherwise authorized and if
     appropriate safeguards are taken to protect against violation of the ADA. These
     safeguards may be either the obligation or administrative reservation of funds to cover
     the potential liability or the inclusion in the agreement of a clause that expressly limits
     the government‘s liability to available appropriations.
     2.3.10.3. There is no doubt that indemnification is controversial and troublesome.
     Although processes may exist to structure indemnification agreements in such a way as to
     make them legally acceptable, they are no substitute for clear legislative authority. If you
     are considering such an agreement and you believe it is sufficiently in the Air Force‘s
     best interests, it is preferable that you seek specific statutory authority to do so through
     your command. As with any other legal issue, solicit the support of your local judge
     advocate office in the indemnification approval process.
  2.3.11. Specific Appropriation Limitations and Purpose Violations. Violations of the
  purpose availability can arise in a wide range of contexts-charging an obligation or
  expenditure to the wrong appropriation, making an obligation or expenditure for an
  unauthorized purpose, violating a statutory prohibition or restriction, etc. NOTE: If the
  appropriation that should have been originally charged has sufficient available funds to
  enable the adjustment of accounts, there is no ADA violation. A violation exists if the proper
  account does not have enough money to permit the adjustment, and this includes cases where
  sufficient funds existed at the time of the error but are currently obligated or expended.
  2.3.12. Amount of Available Appropriation or Fund. The available amount is the
  uncommitted balance of the relevant appropriation. Funds are committed (reserved and
  subtracted from the balance of the appropriation) whenever an AF Form 9, AF Form 616,
  etc., posting enters into the accounting system. When a contract is let or a purchase order
  issued against that commitment document, it moves into the obligation stage. Whenever an
  item ordered from the supply system or a memo due-out firms up, an obligation
  automatically occurs in the accounting system through its interface with the supply system,
  bypassing the commitment stage.
  2.3.13. Intent and Factors Beyond Agency Control. A violation of the ADA does not depend
  on intent or lack of good faith on the part of contracting or other officials who obligate or pay
  in advance or in excess of appropriations. Although these factors may influence the
  applicable penalty, they do not affect the basic determination of whether a violation has
18                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  occurred. An overobligation results from external factors beyond the agency‘s control (e.g.,
  foreign currency fluctuation). Whether this produces an ADA violation depends on the all of
  the particular circumstances.
  2.3.14. Exceptions. The statute prohibits contracts or other obligations in advance or excess
  of available appropriations, unless authorized by law. This is nothing more than the
  recognition that Congress can authorize exceptions to the statutes it enacts.
  2.3.15. Voluntary Services Prohibition. 31 U.S.C., Section 1342, contains two distinct,
  although closely related prohibitions. It bans (1) the acceptance of any type of voluntary
  services for the United States and (2) the employment of personal services ―exceeding that
  authorized by law.‖ The only authorized exceptions to this statute are (1) if a written
  agreement exists that the services are to be rendered gratuitously with no expectation of
  future payment, (2) emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of
  property, and (3) in cases involving the acceptance of voluntary services specifically
  authorized by law.
  2.3.16. Voluntary Creditors. A voluntary creditor is an individual, government or
  nongovernment, who pays what he or she perceives to be a government obligation from
  personal funds. The general rule is that the voluntary creditor cannot be reimbursed, although
  numerous exceptions do exist. Consult with your local judge advocate office in the event you
  need to determine if a particular individual‘s payment for a government obligation is
  reimbursable.
  2.3.17. Apportionment of Appropriations. All appropriations are administratively
  apportioned to ensure their obligation and expenditure at a controlled rate that will prevent
  deficiencies from arising before the end of a fiscal year. An agency must observe the limits
  of its apportionment just as it must observe the limits of its appropriations.
     2.3.17.1. The authority to apportion funds is 31 U.S.C., Section 1512, which states in
     part, ―...an appropriation for obligation for a definite period shall be apportioned to
     prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency
     or supplemental appropriation for the period.‖
     2.3.17.2. 31 U.S.C., Section 1513 gives the authority to apportion executive branch
     funds to the President stating, ―The President shall apportion in writing an appropriation
     available to an executive agency (except the Commission [Federal Trade Commission])
     that is required to be apportioned under Section 1512 of this Title [31 U.S.C.].‖ The
     President exercises this authority through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
     which is part of the Executive Office of the President.
     2.3.17.3. OMB Circular A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates, section
     120, paragraph 120.5 [What Accounts are Apportioned?] states, ―All accounts will be
     apportioned, using the SF 132 (see section 121.1), including special foreign currency
     program appropriation accounts, unless OMB determines otherwise and informs you (or
     has informed you) in writing, except those listed under section 120.6.‖ Air Force O&M
     3400 is not listed in section 120.6; therefore, it is subject to apportionment.
  2.3.18. Penalties and Reporting Requirements. By law (31 U.S.C., Sections 1341, 1349-50,
  and 1517-19), any Air Force member or employee who violates the ADA statutes is subject
  to appropriate administrative discipline including, when circumstances warrant, suspension
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                          19


   from duty without pay or removal from office. A willful violation is a criminal offense,
   subjecting the offender, upon conviction, to a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment
   up to two years, or both. Whenever there is an ADA case, an in-depth investigation is
   required, along with reporting to Congress.
   2.3.19. ADA Prevention. Violations of DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 14, reflect poorly on the
   Air Force‘s ability to manage public funds entrusted to it. The following suggestions will
   help prevent violations:
      2.3.19.1. Follow the procedures of the Air Force accounting systems.
      2.3.19.2. Be familiar with the limits in directives and regulations that affect your
      activities.
      2.3.19.3. Record obligations promptly and keep available balances up to date.
      2.3.19.4. Assign costs to the correct project or account.
      2.3.19.5. Perform required reconciliation and adjustments on a timely basis.
      2.3.19.6. Request and receive an increase in budget authority before incurring additional
      costs.
      2.3.19.7. If in doubt, research the projected results of a planned transaction.
   2.3.20. References. For more information on the ADA see DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 14,
   DoDD 7200.1, Administrative Control of Appropriations, AFI 65-608, Antideficiency Act
   Violations, and GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume II, chapter 6.
2.4. Bona Fide Need Rule (BFNR).
   2.4.1. Definition. The BFNR is based on statutory law (31 U.S.C., Section 1502(a)) although
   it has never been completely solidified by Congress into fiscal law. Basically, the BFNR
   establishes that an appropriation may be obligated only to meet a legitimate, or bona fide
   need arising in, or in some cases arising prior to but continuing to exist in, the fiscal year for
   which the appropriation is authorized. If a funding issue occurs at your base that in your
   opinion could possibly violate the BFNR, contact the local JAG for assistance and public law
   clarification. The following paragraphs describe the BFNR application in more detail but are
   not meant to be all-inclusive on the subject.
   2.4.2. Future Years‘ Needs. Do not use an appropriation for the needs of some time period
   subsequent to the expiration of its period of availability. As most appropriations are annual
   appropriations, a more common statement of the rule is that an appropriation for a given
   fiscal year is not available for the needs of a future year.
   2.4.3. Prior Years‘ Needs. There are situations in which it is not only proper but also
   mandatory to use currently available appropriations to satisfy a need, which arose in a prior
   year. This is referred to as the ―continuing need.‖ If a need arises during a particular fiscal
   year and the agency chooses not to satisfy it during that year, due to insufficient funds or
   higher priority needs, and the need continues to exist in the following year, the obligation to
   satisfy that need must be charged to the later (current) year‘s funds.
   2.4.4. Delivery of Materials beyond the Fiscal Year. You may not obligate funds when it is
   apparent from the outset there will be no legitimate requirement until the following fiscal
20                                                               AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  year. Where materials cannot arrive in the same fiscal year required and contracted for, the
  provisions for delivery in the subsequent fiscal year do not violate the BFNR, as long as the
  time intervening between contracting and delivery is not excessive (within 90 days or three
  months) and the procurement is not for standard commercial items readily available from
  other sources. For instance, a base may contract in one fiscal year for delivery in a
  subsequent year if the material contracted for is not available on the open market at the time
  needed for use, provided the intervening period is necessary for production or fabrication of
  the material. Also, an order for replacement of bench stock is legitimate to meeting the bona
  fide need of the year the contract is let, as long as the intention is to replace stock used in that
  year, even though the replacement items will not be consumed until the following year.
  2.4.5. Services Rendered Beyond the Fiscal Year. Services are generally (but not always)
  viewed as chargeable to the appropriation current at the time services are rendered. There are
  two types of service contracts under the BFNR; they are ―severable‖ or ―entire.‖ Paragraphs
  2.4.5.1 and 2.4.5.2 below describe the BFNR application to each one.
     2.4.5.1. Severable Type Contract. The service is continuing and recurring in nature. The
     FY98 Authorizations Act (P.L. 105-85) has expanded the authority in 10 U.S.C., Section
     2410(a) to permit any 12-month contract for severable services, beginning at any time
     during the fiscal year, to extend into the next fiscal year, using the funds available at the
     time of the contract award. NOTE: The contract must be fully funded at the time of the
     award. The contract period cannot exceed one year and any option to extend or renew the
     contract beyond that time is funded with current year dollars available at the time of the
     exercised option (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.48). This new
     authority does not restrict the type of service procured as the previous authority did.
     ADDITIONAL NOTE: Per the FY04 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 108-136, H.R.
     1588), Section 1005, 10 U.S.C., Section 2401(a) is amended to include the authority of
     short-term leases for real and personal property to cross fiscal years, using funds
     available at the time of the contract award, not to exceed 12 months,
     2.4.5.2. Entire Type Contract. The service represents a single unseverable requirement.
     Charge to the fiscal year of the contract award or obligation. Primary examples of this
     (but not necessarily limited to) are facility projects or one-time repair efforts.
         2.4.5.2.1. The actual contract performance need not begin before the end of the fiscal
         year of the contract obligation, but it should start without any unnecessary delay and
         within a reasonable time (60 days) after award of the contract. In no case should the
         delay of contract performance start beyond the end of the fiscal year exceed three
         months; that is, performance must begin before 1 Jan.
         2.4.5.2.2. Performance begins when the contractor incurs a cost or an obligation for
         work or effort specified in the contract and payment is remitted by DFAS to the
         contractor under the terms of the contract, citing the organization‘s O&M-type funds.
         2.4.5.2.3. Contractor planning and scheduling are not normally considered contractor
         performance except when a design or construction contract calls for a specific design,
         planning, or scheduling performance milestones.
         2.4.5.2.4. A performance bond by itself is not evidence of contract performance.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                          21


           2.4.5.2.5. The ordering of materials, mobilization, or actual work at the project site is
           evidence of performance for BNFR purposes. However:
               2.4.5.2.5.1. The contractor must have in fact incurred an obligation or made an
               actual payment for the materials.
               2.4.5.2.5.2. The act of moving supplies and storing material that the contractor
               already has in inventory is not satisfactory evidence of contract performance in
               and of itself. Evidence of such an obligation by the contractor is generally
               presented in the form of a request for a progress payment or some other
               acceptable evidence to support the incidence of an obligation through the ordering
               of these supplies and materials. Consider contract performance valid in cases
               where the contractor has actually made payment to the supplier for the supplies
               and materials stored on the project site.
   2.4.6. Penalties and Reporting Requirements. A violation of the BFNR could result in
   criminal or administrative actions. A BFNR violation can also lead to an ADA violation. For
   instance, by deobligating funds from one fiscal year because the supply or service was not, or
   is no longer a bona fide need of that fiscal year, you may need to obligate a later year‘s
   funds. If there are insufficient funds remaining in the correct fiscal year, an ADA violation
   may result.
   2.4.7. The BFNR is not applicable to no-year, or nonappropriated funds. This means the
   TWCF is not bound by the BFNR in terms of obligations and expenditures for goods and
   services in support of the airlift mission.
   2.4.8. References. For more information on the BFNR, please refer to DoDFMR 7000.14,
   Volume 14, DFAS-DE interim guidance, Accounting for Obligations (formerly DFAS-DE
   7000.4-R), section 2, paragraphs 2.a. and 2.b., or GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations
   Law, Volume I, chapter 5, section B.
2.5. The ―Necessary Expense‖ Doctrine. The following are excerpts from the GAO:
Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume I, chapter 4, section B, and establishes the
primacy of 31 U.S.C., Section 1301(a) in any discussion of purpose availability. This statute
does not require, nor would it be reasonably possible, that every item of expenditure be specified
in the appropriation act. While the statute is strict, apply it within reason.
   2.5.1. Concepts. The spending agency has reasonable discretion in determining how to carry
   out the objectives of the appropriation. This concept is known as the ―necessary expense
   doctrine,‖ and has existed around almost as long as the statute itself. This doctrine, or rule, is
   really a combination of two slightly different but closely related concepts:
       2.5.1.1. An appropriation made for a specific object is available for expenses necessarily
       incident to accomplishing that object unless prohibited by law or otherwise provided for.
       An example would be to use a specific appropriation for the purpose of building a
       particular monument and constructing a fence around it where administratively deemed
       necessary for protection.
       2.5.1.2. Appropriations, even for broad categories such as salaries, frequently use the
       term ―necessary expenses.‖ As used in this context, the term refers to ―current or running
       expenses of a miscellaneous character arising out of and directly related to the agency‘s
22                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


     work.‖ Although the theory is identical in both of these situations, the difference is that
     expenditures in this category relate to somewhat broader objects.
  2.5.2. Application. The Comptroller General has never established a precise formula for
  determining the application of the necessary expense rule. In view of the vast differences
  among the various government agencies, any such formula is almost certainly unworkable.
  The application is essentially on a case-by-case basis. To justify expenditures under this rule
  requires the following three tests:
     2.5.2.1. The expenditure must bear a logical relationship to the appropriation being
     charged. In other words, it must make a direct contribution to carrying out either a
     specific appropriation or an authorized agency function for which more general
     appropriations are available.
     2.5.2.2. Public Law must not prohibit the expenditure.
     2.5.2.3. The expenditure must not be otherwise provided for, that is, it must not be an
     item that falls within the scope of some other appropriation or statutory funding scheme.
  2.5.3. The first test (paragraph 2.5.2.1 above) is the one that generates the majority of
  questions. The rule does not require that a particular expense be ―necessary‖ in the strict
  sense that someone could not accomplish the objective of the appropriation without it. The
  expense does not have to be the only way to accomplish a given object, nor does it have to
  reflect the GAO‘s perception of the best way to do it. However, the expense in question has
  to be more than merely desirable or even important. An expense is not justifiable because
  some agency official thinks it is a good idea.
     2.5.3.1. The key is not the significance of the proposed expense itself or its value to the
     government or to some social purpose in abstract terms, but the extent to which it will
     contribute to accomplishing the purpose of the appropriation the agency wishes to charge.
     2.5.3.2. A decision on a ―necessary expense‖ question involves (1) analyzing the
     agency‘s appropriations and other statutory authority to determine the authorized
     purpose, and (2) evaluating the adequacy of the administrative justification, to decide
     whether the agency has properly exercised, or exceeded, its discretion.
     2.5.3.3. Specific statutory authority is not essential when determining the authorization
     of a particular expense. If participation directly relates to and is in furtherance of the
     purposes of a particular appropriation, and an appropriate administrative determination
     has been accomplished to that effect, the appropriation is available for the expenditure in
     question.
     2.5.3.4. In the absence of either statutory authority or an adequate justification under the
     necessary expense doctrine, the expenditure is illegal.
  2.5.4. For the second test (paragraph 2.5.2.2 above), as a general proposition, neither a
  necessary expense rationale nor the ―necessary expense‖ language in an appropriation act is
  applicable to overcome a statutory prohibition. There are exceptions where applying the rule
  would make it impossible to carry out a specific appropriation. A very small group of CG
  decisions regarding this issue stand for the proposition that, when Congress issues a specific
  appropriation for a specific purpose, an expenditure which is ―absolutely essential‖ to
  accomplishing the specific object is allowable even though the expenditure is otherwise
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       23


   prohibited. In order for this exception to apply, the expenditure must literally be ―absolutely
   essential‖ in the sense that someone could not accomplish the object of the appropriation
   without it. Also, this rule would not apply to the use of a more general appropriation.
   2.5.5. The third test prohibits any expenditure otherwise provided for under a more specific
   appropriation or statutory funding mechanism. The fact that the more specific appropriation
   may be exhausted is immaterial. The existence of a more specific source of funds, or a more
   specific statutory mechanism for obtaining them, is the governing factor and overrides the
   ―necessary expense‖ considerations.
   2.5.6. References. Consult the GAO publication referenced in paragraph 2.5 above for
   additional information on the ―necessary expense‖ doctrine.
2.6. Participatory Financial Management. This provides the structure to prioritize resource
demands in an order that best accomplishes the overall mission. Conventional economics dictate
there are unlimited demands with only scarce financial resources to meet them.
   2.6.1. This theory holds true in all organizations but is offset by the concept of cost versus
   benefit. Isolation of programs competing for limited financial resources often leads to poor
   decisions when measured against the total mission. Through the corporate committee
   approach, the wing or group commander and supporting staff determines the most effective
   way to set priorities or to reduce, defer, or eliminate programs not critical to the overall
   mission operation. This collective effort provides the commander with the most balanced
   application of financial resources.
   2.6.2. To provide collective management action, each base establishes a Financial
   Management Board (FMB) and a Financial Working Group (FWG). Chapter 3 of this
   instruction provides additional discussion on the FMB and FWG.
2.7. Managerial Responsibilities. While the commander of an organization has the overall
responsibility for its effective management, it becomes necessary to delegate financial
responsibilities from a functional perspective. The commander assigns primary responsibility for
managing programs to line managers who head responsibility centers and are given control of
resources to do the job. The comptroller is assigned concurrent responsibility to provide sound
financial management and advice through the development and use of financial reports and
analysis.
   2.7.1. Commander. The commander sets the tone for the local financial management
   process. Through participatory financial management, the commander asks questions
   regarding program condition, causative factors, weighing alternatives, and directing required
   action. Commanders play an active role in reviewing subordinate responsibility center
   programs. This duty includes formulation and approval of the wing‘s financial plan as well as
   balancing of resource expenditure to mission accomplishment.
   2.7.2. Comptroller. The comptroller operates the infrastructure necessary to provide all
   phases of financial management, including resource allocation and budgeting, cost
   estimating, and accounting. The comptroller organization estimates, accounts, and reports the
   financial costs incurred in sustaining the mission. The financial management
   analysis/services offices accomplish these duties.
   2.7.3. Financial Management Analysis (FMA).
24                                                           AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


     2.7.3.1. The FMA office works with other base organizations by providing budgetary
     services, assisting in estimating program costs, developing budget estimates and financial
     policies, guiding and directing budget justifications. It also provides financial
     management training, support agreement costing, and assists commanders in
     administering all available funding for available programs. Additionally, the FMA office
     acts as an intermediary between base-level activities and the DFAS regional field sites,
     ensuring their base provides all products required by the field sites, as well as providing
     any financial information required by their base-level customers.
     2.7.3.2. FMAs assist managers in estimating the financial needs for programs and
     translating those requirements into financial plans and operating budgets. This includes
     the cost validation of proposed alternatives to meet mission objectives. FMAs ensure
     proposed actions do not exceed the installation‗s resource capability and provide the
     advice necessary on the propriety of the use of funds. FAMs are responsible for timely
     and accurate follow-up for all commitment documents. This includes follow-up on all
     outstanding travel orders and advances. FMAs are the base focal point for all transactions
     requiring fund certification. The FSO certifies fund availability and propriety for all
     travel orders as well as AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, AF Form 616, Fund Cite
     Authorization, AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document,
     AF Form 4009, Government Purchase Card Fund Cite Authorization, and Defense
     Department (DD) Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)
     funding documents.
     2.7.3.3. FMAs distribute budget and expense authority to managers based on the
     approved financial plan. In coordination with the RAs and through the use of available
     financial products, FMAs compare the actual execution of programs against planned
     execution. When deviations occur, FMAs and RAs work jointly to determine the cause.
     2.7.3.4. FMAs develop and ensure training is provided to all financial managers. Local
     conditions may warrant coordination with other resource management elements (e.g.,
     supply transportation, and contracting) for supplemental training. See AMCI 65-601,
     AMC Financial Management for Operations, paragraph 15, regarding RA training.
     2.7.3.5. FMAs provide the above services to tenant organizations in accordance with the
     terms of existing support agreements.
     2.7.3.6. Trend Analysis. FMAs and RAs are responsible to review obligation (O&M) and
     expense (TWCF) trends, to determine if program execution is on track as planned and the
     reasons behind the over-execution or under-execution. This responsibility meets the
     financial managers‘ need to comprehend the overall financial status of his or her
     program.
        2.7.3.6.1. If financial programs track as planned, then the financial manager knows
        that no action is needed. If financial reports indicate the program expenditure or
        obligations are at an accelerated rate or not consumed at the anticipated level, the
        appropriate manager determines and investigates the cause of the deviations. The
        analysis performed by the FMA office and RAs is the basis for recommendations
        given to the manager for action, as well as supporting unfunded requirements to the
        command.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        25


           2.7.3.6.2. The ability to identify deviations is not as simple as it sounds. In order to
           do so, one must have a good understanding of how the accounting system works and
           how to use the available financial management tools. RAs and financial analysts who
           understand how the accounting system operates are better prepared to perform trend
           analysis.
   2.7.4. DELETED.
       2.7.4.1. DELETED.
       2.7.4.2. DELETED.
       2.7.4.3. DELETED.
   2.7.5. The duties of resource advisors, responsibility center managers, and cost center
   managers are explained later on in Chapter 3 of this publication.
2.8. Centrally Managed Programs. It is not uncommon to hear someone refer to an end item
or program as "centrally managed," usually indicating that it is free to the issued organization.
The base or wing does not budget or execute centrally managed programs. The MAJCOM/Air
Force/DoD-assigned functional manager budgets and executes these types of programs.
Examples are military pay and benefits, various depot-funded items, vehicles, and Meals, Ready
to Eat (MRE). The base-level manager does not control the allocation of funds for these
programs; however, many times the consumption of Air Force resources on these programs
prevents funds from being reprogrammed to other areas within the control of base-level
managers. A casual attitude toward a centrally managed program can very easily carry over to a
locally managed program.
2.9. Budget Planning. The basic financial planning tool used to aid decision-making is the
budget; a written plan expressed in dollars. In the past, a budget was regarded primarily as an
instrument to limit expenditures. A more useful approach is to view the budget and budgeting
process as tools for obtaining the most efficient use of an organization's resources. Possibly the
most important asset of budgeting is that it requires managers to look ahead. Budgeting is an
integrating activity enabling each unit to see the impact of its actions and requirements as
compared to the entire organization's objectives. The establishment of standards and realistic
budget estimates requires a comprehensive and clear-cut knowledge of the organization and its
activities. A conscientiously applied budget process can improve internal coordination and
impress on all managers that financial decisions cannot be made in isolation, because all
decisions involve many considerations and affect the total organization. This command places a
great deal of emphasis on the budget process and relies heavily on comprehensive, complete
field budget submissions. The budget should be your primary financial tool.
2.10. Validation of Commitments and Obligations (ODL Certification). DoDFMR 7000.14,
Volume 3, Budget Execution—Availability and Use of Budgetary Resources, chapter 8,
paragraph 080403.E, and DFAS-DE 7220.4-G, Tri-Annual Review Program, provides guidance
for the validation of open commitments and obligations on the ODL (Open Document Listing)
through the Tri-Annual Review process. Effective FY04, each review will focus on all
obligations exceeding $50,000 for O&M-type appropriations (e.g., 3400, 4930 (TWCF)) and
$200,000 in the investment-type appropriations (e.g., 3010, 3011, 3020, 3080). Additionally, the
1st review of the fiscal year targets those obligations in accounts canceling at the end of the
fiscal year, the 2nd review targets those obligations in accounts expired but not canceling, at the
 26                                                              AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


end of the fiscal year, and the 3rd review targets those obligations in accounts expiring at the end
of the fiscal year. For all reviews, Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Documents
(MORDs) with no activity greater than 120 days are also included. Unit resource advisors must
validate and confirm transactions for their accuracy, completeness, and timeliness for each
review in accordance with the instructions contained in DFAS-DE 7220.4-G. A Tri-Annual
Review checklist is available on the AMC/FM Budget Policy CoP at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AM-FM-BH-01,                        under
―Budget Policy Memos and Other Files‖, to assist resource advisors and base FMA office in
completing the review. Select the ―Accounting‖ button under ―AFAFO‖ to access the checklist.
Note: Per SAF/FM direction (see paragraph 5.5.4. of this publication), all Tri-Annual Review
certifications will include a specific attestation that all interagency agreements (e.g., MIPRs) are
consistent with DoD policy.
2.11. Negative Unliquidated Obligation (NULO)/Unmatched Disbursement (UMD)
Transactions. DFAS-DE/ANAA handout entitled Revised Guide for Researching and
Correcting Unmatched Disbursement (UMD) and Negative Unliquidated Obligation (NULO)
Transactions (Problem Disbursements), dated 10 Jul 97 contains policy guidance for processing
NULO and UMD transactions. This is a very important document to have on file, as it provides
detailed instructions on all NULO/UMD procedures. The following Air Force ESP codes are
established to identify disbursements resulting in a NULO or UMD if the obligation of these
amounts is not resolved within 180 days after the disbursement date.
2.12. Prior Fiscal Year (PFY) Management.
   2.12.1. The responsibility for managing funds after completion of close-out continues under
   PFY management. Liquidate PFY funds as you would for current year funds, through the
   processing of invoices and receiving reports. The quality of work done by RAs, financial
   analysts, and accountants during the year when the funds were current determines the level of
   required work when the funds move into the prior year category.
   2.12.2. By accurately recording all obligations and expenses when incurred in the current
   year, the liquidation of these obligations by accountants minimally impacts resource advisors
   and financial analysts. When the FMA office or the individual RAs inaccurately record
   obligations either through erroneous postings or through non-identification, then PFY
   management becomes a difficult issue. This lack of quality work can cause over-obligations
   and result in significant increased workloads for all involved.
   2.12.3. Prior year obligation adjustments are not always the result of the RA, FMA office, or
   accountant oversight. Sometimes they are due to real world changes to the monetary value of
   contractual obligations. These changes fall into one of three categories: (NOTE: These
   categories do not apply to the TWCF - see paragraph 2.12.6.)
       2.12.3.1. Upward Obligation Adjustments. These types of adjustments are usually the
       result of award and incentive fees (target to ceiling incentive contracts), price inflation
       adjustments, and claims. Obligation adjustments resulting from administrative or
       accounting error corrections also fall into this category. Charge these adjustments to the
       O&M fund cite provided on the original contract. If the O&M appropriation on the
       original contract is not available for additional obligations, use current year O&M funds
       (see paragraph 2.12.4 below). All personnel involved with issues that involve/require an
       upward obligation adjustment should be familiar with the policies and procedures set
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     27


     forth in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 6 and Air Mobility Command Supplement 1
     (AMCS1) to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraphs 6.33 and 6.3.7.4.
     2.12.3.2. Within-Scope Contract Changes. This condition identifies contract
     modifications or changes by the requesting activity that require additional within-scope
     work, differing site conditions, and contract defaults resulting in reprocurement actions.
     Such adjustments are properly chargeable to the prior year O&M appropriation cited on
     the original contract if the bona fide need rule is satisfied. If the O&M appropriation on
     the original contract is cancelled, use current year O&M funds (see paragraph 2.12.4
     below)
         2.12.3.2.1. For within-scope contract adjustments attributable to antecedent liability
         (that is, enforceable under a provision of the original contract) charge the adjustment
         increase to the appropriation current at the time the contract was originally executed
         (unless the prior year funds have expired – see paragraph 2.12.4 below). A primary
         example is a mandatory or legal requirement (e.g., regulation, law, state/federal code)
         that existed at the time the contract was awarded (i.e., a bona fide need) and was
         erroneously omitted. This circumstance is considered a ―defective specification‖ case,
         which is cognizable under the ―Changes‖ clause of the contract and is occasionally
         referred to as the doctrine of ―relation back‖. NOTE: For cost reimbursement
         contracts, see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 6, paragraphs 6.3.7.4 and 6.3.7.5, along
         with AFI 65-601 Volume 1_AMCSUP same paragraphs, for additional guidance.
     2.12.3.3. Change (Increase) in Contract Scope. If the required change in obligation does
     not fall into the previous two categories, then the increase is due to a change in contract
     scope. When this occurs, fund the additional requirement from the current year O&M
     appropriation.
     2.12.3.4. All upward adjustments for prior year must be approved in the Obligation
     Adjustment Reporting System (OARS). OARS requests must stand-alone and contain all
     the essential facts for making the bona fide need determination. Any prior year upward
     adjustment entered into the accounting system without a corresponding OARS request is
     subject to an ADA investigation.
     2.12.3.5. For prior year upward obligation adjustments and within scope contract
     changes that require SAF/FM and OUSD(C) approval before the actual release of funds,
     do not pay it (i.e., cash flow) from current year funds in anticipation of receiving prior
     year funding approval, with the intention of adjusting the accounting records to move the
     obligations to the prior year appropriation upon receipt of additional funding.
  2.12.4. Funding of prior year adjustments for O&M appropriations can occur up to five years
  after the funds have expired. After that time, the appropriation is ―canceled‖ and not
  available for funding prior year adjustments. Do not process obligations against cancelled
  year funds. Upon receiving approval through the OARS system, charge all upward
  adjustments for canceled year funds to the current fiscal year using ESP code ZC (Zulu
  Charlie) with an A10 limitation for tracking purposes. Additional information concerning
  O&M prior year management and upward obligation adjustments are found in AFI 65-601,
  Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.

   2.12.5. Replacement Contracts. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.6.14, sets
   conditions when a contractor defaults and reprocurement action is required to initiate a
   replacement contract, utilizing the same fiscal year‘s O&M funds as was provided on the
   original contract. They are:
      2.12.5.1. There is a continuing bona fide need for the goods or services.
      2.12.5.2. The original contract was made in good faith.
      2.12.5.3. The original contract was terminated for default or cause by the Air Force,
      based on a determination that the contract award was improper.
      2.12.5.4. The replacement contract is substantially of the same size and scope as the
      original contract; executed within ―100 days after the date on which the final ruling is
      made on the protest or other action‖ (see 31 U.S.C., Section 1558).
   2.12.6. TWCF PFY Management. The TWCF does not utilize prior year funds as is done
   for O&M 3400 or other appropriated funds. Notwithstanding the establishment of an
   expense accrual or payable (AEU) in the accounting records prior to the end of the fiscal year
   in question, prior year expenses must be covered by current year funding authority.
   Reference AMCI 65-602, chapter 2, paragraph 2.4.8. See also paragraph 2.4.9 of AMCI 65-
   602 for guidance on TWCF undelivered orders outstanding (UOO) or commitment rollovers
   at the end of the fiscal year.
2.13. Feed and Forage Act.
   2.13.1. This Act is codified in Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C., Section 11).
   Under this law, DoD may incur obligations in excess of available appropriations to ensure
   necessary funding to support members of the U.S. Armed Forces. This support is strictly
   limited to clothing, subsistence, fuel, quarters, transportation, and medical/hospital supplies,
   not in excess of the necessities of the current year. While DoD can incur obligations for these
   requirements above what they have the authority to spend, no disbursements can be made
   until the funds are appropriated. The Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) is responsible
   to issue instructions to implement the Feed and Forage Act.
   2.13.2. Prior to incurring any obligations under this Act, each Service is required to identify
   to OSD the specific requirements, by appropriation, which will exceed its current funding
   authority. OSD, in turn, must grant specific ―overspending‖ authority by appropriation to
   incur these obligations. Consequently, it is entirely possible for OSD to invoke the Feed and
   Forage Act and the Air Force will not be authorized to incur obligations in excess of its
   spending authority if they have not previously identified to OSD any ―overspending‖
   requirements. The mere fact that Feed and Forage has been declared does not automatically
   give AMC units the authority to spend in excess of its current O&M 3400 or TWCF (Fund
   Code 68) funding authorities.

                                   THE AMC PROGRAM

3.1. General Information. In an effort to maximize and facilitate the general management
process, AMC has developed an aggressive approach to financial management. The cornerstone
of this approach is flexibility. Therefore, we issue Operation and Maintenance (O&M),
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF), Military Family Housing (MFH), and capital
investment funding by budget activity (BA), budget project account code (BPAC), and
project/sub-project codes, as applicable, and allow flexibility, with very few exceptions
(centrally managed programs) to utilize the funds as necessary to accomplish the assigned
mission. The bases/funding points determine how much to allocate to the various commodities,
i.e., civilian pay, TDY, purchased service contract, etc. Centrally managed program funding,
when issued to the base/unit, such as Sustainment, Restoration, and Maintenance by Contract
(SRMC) is issued on a line item basis and requires HQ AMC approval to reprogram. Motivated,
well-trained financial managers, and strong financial management committees are other key
tenets of AMC financial management.
3.2. O-1 Line Item Structure.
   3.2.1. Public Law established the requirement for O-1 line items in the O&M appropriation.
   O-1 line items, which are a part of BAs and include Activity Groups or Sub Activity Groups
   (AG/SAG), are essentially groupings of program elements, which replaced the Major Force
   Programs (MFP). A list of those applicable AGs/SAGs and their relationship to Program
   Element (PE) codes is published on the HQ AMC/FM web site listed in paragraph 1.3 of
   this publication.
   3.2.2. The O-1 budget structure for O&M (Fund Code 30) is a three-tiered hierarchy that
   aggregates program elements (PE) from various mission-oriented categories.
       3.2.2.1. Budget Activity (BA). This is the funds control point. BAs combine PEs from
       various MFPs into four broad mission categories. They are: 01 – Operating Forces; 02 –
       Mobilization; 03 – Training and Recruiting; and 04 – Administrative and Service-Wide
       Activities. Note: Congress holds the Air Force accountable on how 3400 funding is
       executed by BA and has established a $15M ceiling for the Air Force on reprogramming
       by BA (see AFI 65-601 Volume 1, paragraph 2.3.3.2. for reprogramming thresholds).
       Therefore, you cannot use funding available in one BA to cover requirements in another
       BA, even though it is all in appropriation 3400. To do this constitutes an augmentation of
       appropriations and could potentially lead to an ADA. If you are faced with a funding
       shortfall in one BA and have requirements that exceed available funding and you want to
       use available funding from another BA, you must first submit a reprogramming request to
       HQ AMC/FMA, who will forward it to SAF/FMBO for approval. SAF/ FMB will realign
       funds between the applicable BAs (as long as it does not exceed the $15M congressional
       ceiling) and issue HQ AMC/FMA a funding document reflecting the change.
       3.2.2.2. Activity Groups (AG) or O-1. These are shreds of BAs into more specific
       mission or functional categories. The O-1 Line Item structure is for O&M only. See AFI
       65-601, Volume 2, Budget Management for Operations, Attachment 3, and AFMAN 65-
       604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes, under the category of 3400/Fund Code
 30                                                             AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


      30 funds, for a detailed description of each activity group under the BAs listed in the
      above paragraph.
      3.2.2.3. Sub-Activity Groups (SAG). These are additional shreds of the AGs into even
      more specific mission and functional alignments. SAGs are not funding control points
      nor do we explain funding realignments at this level. SAGs are aggregations of PEs that
      relate to specific missions or functions and will provide Congress more visibility on
      funding of specific missions.
   3.2.3. Budget Project Account Codes (BPAC) for TWCF. The TWCF (Fund Code 68)
   utilizes BPACs to track funding and execution of its Operating and Capital programs. They
   include: 101 – Operating – (all other); 102 – Commercial Augmentation; 103 – Military
   Augmentation; 210 – Minor Construction (MC) equal to or greater than $100,000; 220 –
   ADPE Equipment $250,000 or greater; 230 – Equipment, non-ADPE $250,000 or greater;
   240 – ADPE Software Development $250,000 or greater; and 3XX – Maintenance and
   Repair, and Minor Construction work (less than $100,000) – Contract and In-House. Each
   BPAC may contain shreds to further identify costs by specific programs within the BPAC.
   All 1XX and 3XX BPACs are funded and executed within the TWCF Operating program and
   all 2XX BPACs are funded and executed within the TWCF Capital program. See AMCI 65-
   602, chapter 8, for further discussion on the TWCF Capital program.
   3.2.4. Project/Sub-Project Codes for MFH. Specific project/sub-project codes, i.e., 728,
   72810, 72262, etc., are used by MFH to track funding and execution of their funds (FC 3Y).
   See Chapter 24 of this publication for further discussion.

   3.3.2. Resource Advisor (RA). Each RCM should appoint a RA in writing to the FMA
   Office. Resource "advising" is usually an additional duty, but should not be taken lightly.
   This individual is the focal point of the AMC financial management system and requires
   proper training to accomplish these assigned duties. It is for this reason that specialized one-
   on-one training for each newly appointed RA (primary and alternate) is essential, in
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     31


   accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 2, chapter 10, paragraph 10.2.5, and AMCI 65-601,
   paragraph 15.
      3.3.2.1. The RAs are the ―budget officers‖ for their particular organizations. Their
      responsibilities include preparation of operating budget estimates; representing their
      RCM at the Financial Working Group (FWG); recommending initial distribution of funds
      and reprogramming actions to various CCs (if applicable); and ensuring the proper
      training of all subordinate cost center managers (CCM) in financial management
      procedures.
      3.3.2.2. Appoint alternate RAs in all RCs. This facilitates the transition between old and
      new RAs and fills a void during the absence of the primary RA.
   3.3.3. Cost Center Manager (CCM). The CCM is the lowest level in the RCM resource
   management chain, yet potentially one of the most important. The CCM is not appointed,
   because it is not an additional duty. The work center supervisors assume CCM responsibility
   by virtue of their positions. The degree to which a CCM becomes involved in the
   organization's financial program depends largely on the desires of the RCM and RA.
   However, as a minimum, CCMs should budget for and manage their supply and equipment
   programs. Provide CCMs both annual and quarterly targets in the base-level supply system or
   by a memorandum from the RA. NOTE: The RA is responsible to train the CCM.
      3.3.3.1. We encourage CCMs to participate in other areas besides supplies and
      equipment to the maximum extent possible for two reasons: (1) the more people involved
      in the program, the stronger the program should be and (2) CCMs help the RA and can
      serve to subdivide their workload. Remember, the RA position is usually an additional
      duty on top of their normal day-to-day job responsibilities.

3.6. The Budget Life Cycle. The wing‘s budget process is part of a much larger system. This
system is called the Biennial Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (BPPBS). The
BPPBS is extremely complex and matches military missions to national security, force
requirements to military missions, programs to force requirements, and budgets that are in
balance with programs. From the installation point of view, the budget process begins with the
Financial Plan (Fin Plan) Call, continues with initial distribution and execution, becomes an
expired appropriation after close-out, and finally lapses into the canceled year account.
3.7. O&M Execution Plan and TWCF Budget Estimate Submission/Amended Budget
Estimate Submission (BES/ABES).
   3.7.1. O&M Execution Plan. HQ AMC/FMA sends out the O&M Execution Plan Call to the
   AMC bases/funding points with inputs generally due in April. The command execution plan
   is usually due to SAF/FMB in June. To prepare, the local FMA office should send an
   installation level Call to the RAs several weeks before the anticipated date of receipt of the
   HQ AMC O&M Execution Plan Call. This gives the RAs more time to compile their
   requirements and submit them to the local FMA office. It also allows the FMA office enough
   time to compile the RA requirements and obtain any additional information requested in the
   command O&M Call.
   3.7.2. The Call contains specific guidance on how to prepare the O&M Execution Plan
   submission and what programs to include in the plan. The Call includes a ―bogey‖ figure that
   indicates the anticipated funding provided next year by budget activity. The wing level FMA
   office, in turn, issues a bogey to the units that comprise the local financial structure. In the
   vast majority of cases, this tentative funded dollar amount is less than actual requirements.
   The wing‘s participatory management process develops an O&M Execution Plan that funds
   the most critical requirements and identifies the rest as unfunded requirements.
   3.7.3. Although the techniques for preparing the O&M Execution Plan and TWCF
   BES/ABES have changed over the years, the budget process still relies on the building block
   approach for preparation and consolidation. The process starts at the lowest practical level
   and flows upward to each commander, who approves the unit‘s submission and sends it to
   the FMA office. Generate required narrative justification and other supporting data from the
   lowest financial reporting level, which is the basic foundation of any base level budget.
   3.7.4. The narrative justification is the ―meat‖ of the O&M Execution Plan and TWCF
   BES/ABES and should bring to life the mission programs that the requested funds will
   accomplish. The primary purpose of the O&M Execution Plan and TWCF BES/ABES is to
   tell the MAJCOM not only how much money you need to carry out the objectives, but also
   why you need it. Good justifications sell valid requirements. The unit closest to the
   requirement is in the best position to provide the proper justification. The submission should
   strive to be of such quality that there should be little need for further explanation or narrative
   justification by the FMA office or the comptroller, once submitted. Try to answer the
   following questions with your narrative: (1) What capabilities are/are not being funded? (2)
   What trade-offs did you make? (3) What are the risks and impacts?
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         33


   3.7.5. After the FMA office receives and consolidates all of the data, the FWG and FMB
   reviews the total requirements in detail to identify, price out, and include in the submission
   the accomplishment of the overall mission. The commander is the final approval authority for
   the installation‘s O&M Execution Plan as well as the TWCF BES/ABES.
   3.7.6. TWCF BES/ABES. HQ AMC/FMA sends out the TWCF BES/ABES Call normally
   in the February-March time frame (depending upon the USTRANSCOM (USTC) BES
   requirement date), allowing four-six weeks to prepare and provide a consolidated BES
   submission to USTC/TCJ8. Each base level TWCF BES/ABES should reflect the most
   accurate portrayal of estimated costs to provide airlift services at the particular location. The
   following is applicable to the base level submission of the TWCF BES/ABES to HQ AMC:
       3.7.6.1. Each TWCF base/funding point sends an estimate of anticipated new
       requirements for the budget years along with one-time unique requirements spent on the
       prior and current years for all TWCF organizations under its control. Submit the general
       statements, schedules, and exhibits in accordance with the command budget call
       instructions issued by HQ AMC/FMA. See chapter 7 of AMCI 65-602 for additional
       guidance.
3.8. Initial Distribution.
   3.8.1. Depending on the passage of the appropriations bill, initial distribution normally
   occurs in the December-January time frame, except for the TWCF, which is usually
   accomplished in October or November. HQ AMC/FMA issues TWCF and O&M general
   initial distribution guidance to the bases at the beginning of the new fiscal year. The
   command TWCF and O&M initial distribution contains the funded dollar amounts and other
   applicable fiscal guidance.
   3.8.2. For O&M, the funded amount is based on the installation‘s Execution Plan. The
   amount is increased or decreased, depending on known changes from the time of the base
   Execution Plan submission to when the command approves and issues initial distribution to
   the bases. The amount includes funding for centrally managed programs such as flying hours
   and civilian pay. Changes to the foreign currency budgeted rate also affect the funded
   distribution. HQ AMC/FMA accomplishes initial distribution by budget activity, sub-activity
   group, program element, and element of expense/ investment code.
   3.8.3. The command‘s fiscal guidance contains detailed information for use in managing the
   wing‘s financial program. It is designed to allow flexibility to reprogram funds to meet the
   local commander‘s mission priorities within established guidelines. It discusses special
   funding procedures, required reports, and describes what constitutes centrally managed
   programs. The fiscal guidance also contains the ―rules‖ of how bases may execute the funds
   allocated to them.
3.9. Budget Execution.
   3.9.1. Budget execution occurs at the installation level and begins with the distribution of
   TWCF and O&M funds. The installation accomplishes its initial distribution to resource
   managers using the participatory management process. You should convene a FWG to make
   changes to the Fin Plan distribution based on changes in requirements from the time of the
   Fin Plan development. The FWG submits a proposed annual (all appropriations) and
   quarterly (O&M appropriations only) operating budget for review and approval. The FMA

   office distributes the approved operating budget, expense authority, to the RCMs with the
   annual and quarterly authority, as applicable. The RCMs develop their own operating
   budgets for subordinate units and identify their plans back to the FMA office as ―targets‖.
   3.9.2. Targets are a translation of planned mission requirements into dollar values required
   to perform the missions. Targets serve as guidelines for the consumption of resources,
   provide the measurement tool to determine planning effectiveness, and provide the control
   mechanism to manage their budgets. There are two types of targets that make up this tracking
   system - annual and quarterly.
      3.9.2.1. Annual. Annual targets (also known as annual authority) reflect the approved
      amount of funds that an organization can commit or obligate during the year. Annual
      authority is a legal limitation; do not exceed this funding level. Therefore, each
      organization must plan its requirements accordingly. Make adjustments to the targets
      during the year due to mission change reprogramming or receipt of additional funding for
      unfunded requirements.
      3.9.2.2. Quarterly. Quarterly targets (also known as quarterly authority) reflect the
      amount of funds that an organization can commit or obligate within a specific quarter.
      The intent of quarterly targets is to avoid over-obligating an annual program by
      accelerated spending early in the fiscal year. Quarterly authority is a legal limitation
      dictated by public law for appropriated funds. Quarterly determination is very important
      because it reflects the phased way to plan and execute your annual programs. Funding of
      $100,000 or more issued for facility projects will be issued with an associated increase in
      quarterly authority. NOTE: For the TWCF, quarterly targets are unnecessary. Normally,
      the annual amount is input into the quarterly field in the accounting system.
      3.9.2.3. Local conditions dictate the level of detail of your target establishment.
      However, at a minimum, you should establish targets at points where financial managers
      can make funding decisions. The usual practice is to align the amounts at the level
      required to maintain program element identification and to support other command
      directed actions. They should be sufficient to compare planned execution to actual
      execution.
3.10. (DELETED)
3.11. Training.
   3.11.1. One of the most important jobs of the FMA office is to train financial managers.
   More details on the type and amount of training required are found in AFI 65-601, Volume 2,
   chapter 11. A key element contained in this guidance is the specialized treatment of the
   primary and alternate RAs.
   3.11.2. Equally important is to identify those individuals who need training and to train them
   soon after identification and within 90 days of appointment. Frequently, the quality of
   Resource Management System (RMS) training programs is tainted by poor documentation.
   See AMCI 65-601, paragraph 15 for additional information on RA training.
   3.11.3. To ensure that your RMS training is current and beneficial, you may want to
   establish a trainee feedback sheet to assess the quality and depth of your training. As the
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         35


   RMS structure evolves to accommodate changes within the DoD, your training must change
   to maintain currency.
3.12. Target Loading.
   3.12.1. Because budget targets are estimates, they are admittedly inaccurate. This fact does
   not negate their usefulness or importance. All military economical decisions involve
   forecasting with few exceptions. However, the inherent risks involved in forecasting cannot
   and do not stop decisions. The budget does not remain fixed and is by necessity a continuing
   process of monitoring, reviewing, evaluating, and adjusting. Flexibility is an important key to
   effective resource management.
   3.12.2. RCMs should ensure these are consistent with your annual and quarterly programs.
   Identify funding shortages and overages as quickly as possible. Additionally, RCMs must
   continually assess actual cost versus services provided or outputs produced.
   3.12.3. Comptroller personnel must not arbitrarily change targets without the approval of the
   RA and RCM and must ensure they do not exceed base-wide restrictions or limitations. This
   includes, but not limited to, quarterly programs and legal or administrative targets. You
   should ensure target loads agree with the limitations stated on your funding document. Each
   RCM has the responsibility and flexibility to reprogram funds within their respective RC
   unless there is a specific command limitation on reprogramming within that area. You must
   continuously review and analyze actual expenses versus approved programs.
   3.12.4. Targets are one of the principal concerns of financial committees. Do they reflect the
   correct priority allocation of available resources? Are reprogramming actions necessary to
   accomplish mission requirements? The FWG should identify reprogramming actions
   between organizations that exceed the FMB approved dollar threshold. The FMB should
   approve (or deny) these requested reprogramming actions on a case by case basis.
   3.12.5. General Accounting and Finance System (BQ). Distribute targets to the RC in which
   the expenses or obligations incur. Targeting to cost or work center level is optional and left to
   the discretion of the RCM. This applies to O&M as well as the TWCF.
   3.12.6. Standard Base Supply System (SBSS). Normally, the Logistics Readiness Squadron
   (LRS) assigns each RC a Project Funds Management Record (PFMR) to record all
   organizational supply and equipment transactions. LRS also assigns subordinate CCs, at least
   one Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR or ORG code), linked to the PFMR. Load
   targets to this ORG code level. For CCs assigned several ORG codes, load targets to only one
   ORG code. The only exception applies to the Services and Civil Engineering PFMRs where
   target loading to more than one ORG code is optional.
3.13. Legal, Administrative, and Operational Limitations, and Readiness Guides. See
funding documents for specifics. ―A‖ limitations are legal, based on public law; ―B‖ limitations
are administrative; ―OF limitations are operational; and ―R‖ equates to readiness guides, all
based on DoD or Air Staff guidance.
   3.13.1. Floors. Floors are an administrative or legal limitation identified in your funding
   document. Floors represent a minimum level of funding executable in the respective
   program. You can spend more than the established floor, but not less.
36                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  3.13.2. Ceilings. Ceilings are an administrative or legal limitation identified in your funding
  document. Ceilings identify a maximum limit of spending; do not exceed these ceilings
  without prior approval from HQ AMC/FMA.
  3.13.3. Fences. HQ AMC/FMA establishes fences to preclude units from reprogramming
  funds into or out of a particular area. Examples are utilities, facility projects, and A-E
  services commodities.
  3.13.4. Readiness Guides. These are mandated by Congress, through public law, which
  requires SAF/FM to provide Mid-Year and an End-of-Year Readiness Transfer Report to
  explain any differences between reported funding and actual obligations. Transfers into or
  out of Readiness Guides do not require advance approval; however, commands must report
  movements over $500,000 into or out of these SAGs and cannot migrate funds from SAGs
  011A, 011G, or 011E without prior congressional approval. Listed below are the legal,
  administrative, and operational limitations as well as readiness guides currently used in
  AMC, to include the limitation type and associated SAG/DoDEE and PE (if applicable). All
  ―A‖ limitations are legally binding as directed by Congress while ―B‖ limitations represent
  targets but should be closely monitored. ―OF‖ limitations are Air Force-directed for flying
  hours. ―M‖ and ―T‖ limitations represent fences imposed by HQ AMC/FMA. These
  limitations change frequently from FY to FY and new ones not listed below may occur. If
  you should have any questions concerning changes to the current status of funding
  limitations, contact the funds control section of HQ AMC/FMA. ―A‖, ―B‖, and ―OF‖
  limitations shown below do not represent all established Air Staff limitations.

3.14. Funding Distribution System.
   3.14.1. HQ AMC/FMA accomplishes initial distribution of funds to all AMC funding points
   at some time on or after the beginning of each fiscal year. The comptroller is the primary
   focal point for the administration of funding programs, dissemination of major funding
   guidance, and funding decisions made through HQ AMC coordinated staff actions. HQ AMC
   staff agencies have the responsibility of monitoring the funding programs and making
   recommendations within their areas of interest.
   3.14.2. Funding Documents. The funds control section of HQ AMC/FMA issues numerous
   Automated Funds Management (AFM) and Program Budget Accounting System (PBAS)
   funding documents each month. Most Treasury Index 97-appropriations are issued in PBAS
   (excluding Fund Code 68 – TWCF (97X4930.FD40)).
      3.14.2.1. HQ AMC/FMA accepts funding changes from the individual AMC
      base/Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN) financial analyst for the current
      month‘s AFM document through close of business on the last working day of the month
      less three workdays. For example, if the last workday of the month falls on the 29th, funds
      control should receive all funding changes for the month by COB on the 26th unless it
      happens to fall on a weekend or holiday, in which case funds control should receive all
      funding changes by COB on the preceding workday. Beginning the following workday,
      funds control will issue all funding changes on the following month‘s document. The
      bases/OBANS should not have any funding changes for the current month called down
      after the 3rd workday from the end of the month. This helps to facilitate the end of month
      balancing of your funding targets. After that time, do not identify any funding change
      requests to HQ AMC/FMAO (Funds Control section), unless they are emergency in
      nature.
          3.14.2.1.1. Each HQ AMC/FMA base/OBAN analyst will balance the current month
          AFM funding document for all BAs, BPACs, and limitations prior to the last day to
          issue funding changes. You must research and correct any funding discrepancies
          between the base and HQ AMC at that time.
          3.14.2.1.2. (DELETED)
      3.14.2.2. Command AFM funding documents generated as a result of funding actions are
      dated for the first of the month issued rather than the actual date of issue, with should
      coincide with the call-outs you receive through the automated FM Suite system.
 38                                                             AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


       3.14.2.3. You will be notified of funding changes via FM Suite (for current year FC 30
       and current year FC 68 only), E-mail, or telecom from your HQ AMC/FMA analyst.
       3.14.2.4. The funds control section issues TWCF funding authorities for the Operating
       Budget, to include Maintenance and Repair (MR), as follows:
           3.14.2.4.1. Expense authority for the Operating Budget finances accounting stages
           Accrued Expenditures Unpaid (AEU) and Accrued Expenditures Paid (AEP).
           Undelivered Orders Outstanding (UOO) and commitments do not count against
           expense authority. All UOO accounting data at the end of the fiscal year carries
           forward to the new fiscal year. All commitments, except contingent liabilities, must
           be obligated or canceled in the yearend close-out process. The new fiscal year
           expense authority applies against these UOOs when they become expenditures (AEU
           and AEP).
           3.14.2.4.2. Because the Air Force accounting systems are based on obligations and
           commitments, not expenses, HQ AMC/FMAO (Funds Control Section) will issue
           UOO authority to avoid manual tracking systems. The total of expense and UOO
           authorities will equal "direct" funds, defined under O&M-funded programs.
           3.14.2.4.3. HQ AMC/FMA issues program authority for the TWCF Capital Budget
           and provides funding for commitments as well as all stages of obligation, similar to
           the O&M appropriation. However, unlike O&M, it does not expire. You must ensure
           the obligation of TWCF Capital funds in the year of execution. The inability to
           obligate the TWCF Capital program may impact future year funding. See AMCI 65-
           602, chapter 2, paragraph 2.4.8 on funding restriction using prior year TWCF Capital
           funds.
           3.14.2.4.4. Reprogramming Authority. HQ AMC/FMA grants reprogramming
           authority only within the TWCF Operating Budget, BPAC 101. The only exception to
           this authority within the TWCF Operating Budget is funding issued for utilities, CE
           service contracts, and A-E services. Funding for these commodities cannot be
           reprogrammed without approval of HQ AMC/ A7R/FMA. Do not reprogram into, out
           of, or between TWCF Capital program categories without HQ AMC/A7R/FMA
           approval. Also, you may not reprogram any funding authority from the Operating
           (BPAC 101) to MR (BPAC 3XX) (or vice versa) unless approved by HQ
           AMC/A7R/FMA. Additionally, do not reprogram TWCF funding into, out of, or
           between MR (BPAC 3XX) projects without HQ AMC/A7R/FMA approval.
3.15. Military Health Service. The resource allocation and financing mechanisms for the
Military Health Service (MHS) is available to encourage improved efficiency and effectiveness.
The MHS resources are allocated based on a capitation-based methodology that allocates O&M
dollars for direct care. The central Defense Health Program distributes these funds, established to
improve overall management of military health services programs.

                          WORKING CAPITAL FUNDS (WCF)

4.1. Background.
   4.1.1. The DoD expanded the use of business financial management practices through the
   establishment of the Defense Business Operating Fund (DBOF) on 1 October 1991 (FY92).
   Defense Management Report Decision (DMRD) 971, DoD Financial Systems, provided the
   foundation for the DBOF operational policies and procedures. The DBOF operated with
   financial principles that provide improved cost visibility and accountability to enhance
   business management and improve the decision making process. The DBOF evolved on
   revolving fund concepts previously used for industrial and commercial-type activities.
      4.1.1.1. The establishment of the DBOF did not change previous organizational reporting
      structures or command authority relationships. The combining of business activities
      under a single treasury code (97X4930) originally allowed consolidation of cash
      management, while functional and cost management responsibilities remained with the
      military departments and defense agencies. Effective FY95, cash management was again
      relegated to the military departments and defense agencies.
   4.1.2. Working Capital Fund (WCF) Establishment. On 11 Dec 96, the Undersecretary of
   Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C) signed a decision paper eliminating the DBOF and
   established the WCF in its place, granting the Services the authority to manage them. This
   action created five divisions of the WCF, with the Air Force Working Capital Fund
   (AFWCF) designated as the responsible agent for DBOF-T (now TWCF - see subsequent
   paragraph 4.2.2), for administrative and cash purposes only.
      4.1.2.1. The primary purpose of each division of the WCF is to provide a business
      management structure that encourages managers and employees of DoD support
      organizations to provide quality products and services at the lowest cost. A major feature
      of this business management structure is the emphasis on business operations. This
      business operation structure identifies each business area, the products or services, and
      the total cost of operations within that business area.
      4.1.2.2. Under this structure, customers establish requirements and are charged, through
      the rate structure, for the cost of industrial and commercial-type services and products
      provided. Providers, in turn, produce quality goods and services that satisfy customer
      requirements at the lowest cost. Support organizations incur costs based on customer
      orders. This linkage of support costs to customer funding assures better communication
      between the customer and the provider. By making the producing organization
      responsible for all costs associated with delivering the goods or service, those managers
      will identify cost drivers and can focus their management improvement efforts
      accordingly. Increased cost visibility enables managers at all levels to make informed
      decisions.
   4.1.3. Additional guidance on WCF and the former Air Force stock and industrial funds may
   be found in DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 12, Special Accounts, Funds and Programs,
   DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 2B, Budget Presentation and Formulation, and DoDFMR

   7000.14, Volume 11B, Reimbursable Operations, Policy and Procedures Working Capital
   Funds (WCF).
4.2. Concept of Operations.
   4.2.1. The primary goal of each division of the WCF is to provide a business management
   structure that encourages managers and members of DoD organizations to provide quality
   products and services at the lowest cost while still meeting mission objectives. The focus is
   to reduce costs in the DoD to allow a greater percentage of the DoD budget to go to
   operational requirements. To achieve this goal, the WCF expands the relationship between
   the customer and the provider.
   4.2.2. Although the former Military Airlift Command (MAC) operated an industrial fund
   (Airlift Services Industrial Fund (ASIF)) for over 20 years, by design, it did not totally
   recover all costs through rate structure revenue. The difference between the revenue collected
   and costs incurred was covered by direct appropriations through the O&M account. This
   concept carried over into DBOF-T, now called the Transportation Working Capital Fund
   (TWCF).
   4.2.3. IN FY97, the TWCF evolved out of the DBOF-T (which absorbed the ASIF in FY93)
   and continues operations through USTRANSCOM. All budget and accounting policies,
   practices, and procedures previously applicable to DBOF-T remain the same for TWCF. The
   military components for the TWCF are Air Mobility Command (AMC) for airlift, Military
   Sealift Command (MSC) for sealift, Surface Deployment and Distribution Command
   (SDDC) for surface transportation, and the Defense Courier Service (DCS). USTRANSCOM
   will continue to be responsible for managing the functional and financial aspects of DCS
   supported functions and activities through HQ AMC. USTRANSCOM still remains the
   single manager for all DoD transportation. AMC wings with a transportation airlift mission
   receive a combination of TWCF and O&M funding support.
   4.2.4. For additional guidance on TWCF concepts regarding the organizational Operating
   and Capital budget and execution processes as well as specific TWCF funding policy issues,
   consult AMCI 65-602, specifically chapters 2, 6, 7, and 8.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        41


                                           Chapter 5

                           REVENUE AND REIMBURSEMENTS

5.1. General Information. Revenue and reimbursements frequently cause problems, mainly
because they are misunderstood. Financial analysts and financial managers must fully understand
reimbursements and carefully manage them throughout the year. Read AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
Budget Guidance and Procedures, chapter 5, and incorporate this subject in your financial
training program.
   5.1.1. The functional manager should, with the help of the financial analyst, recognize
   revenue requirements, properly budget for them, and continuously manage the program from
   the time of anticipated revenue to the time collected. The functional managers should
   determine what is reimbursable and ensure the proper documentation and billing of required
   support. The failure of an organization to bill for reimbursable support consumes direct
   program authority to support someone else's requirements. In other words, your
   organization‘s funds are financing the operational costs of another organization that has the
   funding responsibility for it. This should provide sufficient incentive for proper
   administration of the revenue program.
   5.1.2. A significant part of your revenue program consists of civilian pay. If your civilian
   pay program is centrally managed by the Civilian Employment Cost Management Committee
   (CECMC), it is inconsistent to decentralize the civilian pay revenue program to the RC level.
   However, this does not eliminate the necessity for the functional manager to properly
   document and bill civilian labor support. If you decentralize the base's total civilian pay
   program to the RC level, then decentralize the civilian pay revenue program to the same level
   as well.
   5.1.3. The TWCF or Military Family Housing (MFH) is responsible for a large part of your
   reimbursement. For this reason, it is helpful for budget and appropriate FMA personnel to
   obtain a working knowledge of the Integrated Work Information Management System
   (IWIMS). Both the HQ AMC/FM and A7 staffs recommend two procedures to properly
   identify reimbursable support.
       5.1.3.1. Functional area chiefs (users), CE, and financial analysis should jointly prepare a
       complete list of reimbursable facilities and update this list prior to preparation of the
       O&M, MFH, and the TWCF budgets. You should reconcile this list with the IWIMS
       records to ensure proper coding in the CE system, which should also reflect the items
       reimbursed by the customer, i.e., utilities, facility maintenance and repair, custodial
       services, etc.
       5.1.3.2. Because of frequent changes to utility prices, compute utility billings monthly.
       Additionally, CE should provide the base FMA with monthly utility estimates for all
       reimbursable customers.
5.2. Reimbursements from Tenant Units. Services provided to tenant units earn part of your
reimbursement program. Your local host-tenant support agreements identify these services and
annual anticipated reimbursements. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7 and DoDI
4000.19, Interservice, Interdepartmental, and Interagency Support for financial guidance.
 42                                                             AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


5.3. Support Agreements.
   5.3.1. Support agreements are formal agreements that define recurring services provided by
   the supplier to the receiver and define the basis for calculating the reimbursable charges.
   Supplying units identify costs incurred in providing services, the FMA office determines or
   reviews the cost factors, and the agreements are staffed, controlled, and monitored by HQ
   AMC/A4R. Support agreements are usually valid for two years and reviewed annually by
   FMA. RAs are routinely the unit‘s point of contact for agreements and are responsible to
   identify earned reimbursable costs to the FM.
   5.3.2. At times the required support is not continuing and recurring. The issue and
   acceptance of a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) (DD Form 448
   and DD Form 448-2) is the vehicle to establish appropriate support reimbursement. The
   requesting activity sends the providing activity the DD Form 448 and the providing activity
   formalizes the two-party agreement by completing the DD Form 448-2 acceptance, on a
   reimbursable basis. This form is also applicable to provide the funding mechanism to some
   existing support agreements.
   5.3.3. Once a reimbursable agreement is in effect, the supplying activity must track support
   costs and ensure they identify to the supporting DFAS field site any reimbursements earned
   in accordance with the agreement. At the end of each month, the supplying activity identifies
   actual costs incurred in the previous month and the estimated costs for the coming month
   (quarterly estimates can be used in lieu of monthly estimates). The memorandum must
   identify the support agreement, any other pertinent information, and must also contain
   sufficient detailed costs to satisfy the billed agency. Once the supplying activity provides the
   proper supporting documentation, the DFAS field site‘s accounts receivable section is
   responsible for ensuring the receiver pays the full amount in a timely manner, unless
   authorized to cross disburse the receiver‘s funds.
   5.3.4. See Chapter 20, paragraph 20.4 of this publication for further discussion on support
   agreements.
5.4. The Economy Act.
   5.4.1. 31 U.S.C., Section 1535, otherwise known as the Economy Act, authorizes
   government agencies to enter into contracts with one another when it is in the government‘s
   best interest. For AMC, this solely involves the financing of orders between an AMC Air
   Force activity and other United States government departments or agencies outside the DoD.
   AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, Section D. and DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 3, paragraph
   080603.B., discuss orders placed under the Economy Act. You must downwardly adjust any
   obligations recorded against annual or multi-year appropriations at the end of the period
   authorized for the appropriation to obligate, to the extent the performing agency has not
   incurred valid obligations to complete the order. Amend the order to reflect a current year
   fund cite to complete the procurement in the new fiscal year. The following paragraphs
   highlight other key points of the Economy Act.
   5.4.2. Financing and Executing Economy Act Orders. To the maximum extent possible,
   AMC units will finance Economy Act orders received from or issued to non-DoD
   government agencies using the direct citation or reimbursement method. If you run into a
   case where these financial methods are not acceptable, advise HQ AMC/FMA in writing and
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        43


   we will submit it to SAF/FMBM. Provide details as to why you cannot finance the Economy
   Act order using these methods. SAF/FMBM will determine the appropriate financing method
   and advise HQ AMC/FMA accordingly.
   5.4.3. Most non-DoD government agencies have agreed to use the reimbursement method of
   financing Economy Act orders to the Air Force. However, some agencies, by agreement,
   require payment in advance from the ordering agency. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7,
   paragraph 7.25.3 for agencies authorized to receive advance payments to finance all
   Economy Act orders received. If another non-DoD government agency not listed therein
   requests advance payment for the delivery of goods services, advise HQ AMC/FMA who
   will obtain SAF/FMBM approval.
      5.4.3.1. Don‘t authorize or make advance payments from Air Force O&M appropriations
      that exceed the estimated cost of goods or services provided by the performing agency
      during the fiscal year the advance payment is made.
      5.4.3.2. Continue to monitor all aspects of advance payments to authorized non-DoD
      government agencies. You must require the performing agency to (1) return estimated 30
      September unobligated balances by 15 August of the FY in which you make the advance
      payment and (2) return unexpended balances upon completing the Economy Act order.
   5.4.4. Because other government agencies who provide goods or services to the Air Force
   via Economy Act orders may operate on limited financial resources, it is imperative that you
   submit their bills to your supporting DFAS field site promptly to accomplish payment in a
   timely manner. The same holds true of goods or services you provide to other government
   agencies--submit billing data to the DFAS field site promptly in order to expedite
   reimbursement.
   5.4.5. Determining Charges for Economy Act Orders from Non-DoD Government Agencies.
   Follow guidance in DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 11A, chapter 3, as well as AFI 65-601,
   Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph 7.17 to determine the appropriate charges for materiel, work,
   services, and overhead. Administrative overhead is part of actual costs under the Economy
   Act, and properly chargeable to non-DoD government agencies. You may suspend
   reimbursement (except for orders provided to or received from Working Capital Funds) if the
   accumulated value of goods and services provided is less than $1,000 until the end of the
   fiscal year, or until the total bill exceeds $1,000. However, the total amount must be billed at
   the end of the fiscal year even though it is less than $1,000.
   5.4.6. Suspended Billings of Small Amounts to DoD Agencies. See paragraph 5.4.5 above.
5.5. Orders Required by Law.
   5.5.1. These constitute orders required under specific legal authority (e.g., the Information
   Technology Fund. established under 40 U.S.C., Section 757, codified under Public Law 104-
   106). Record these orders placed with non-DoD government agencies as obligations when
   issued in accordance with DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 3, chapter 8, paragraph 080704. See
   AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph 7.2.5. for a list of those federal agencies whose
   orders are required by law.
   5.5.2. Any order required by law with another government agency is not subject to the
   Economy Act. Fiscal year-end deobligation requirements in paragraph 5.4.1 above do not
 44                                                           AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   apply. The uncontracted portion of the MIPR may remain with the agency providing the
   goods or services beyond the end of the period of availability until the account closes to
   cover anticipated operating needs relating to the ordering unit‘s basic requirement.
   5.5.3. If the requesting organization‘s appropriation on the order (i.e., MIPR, Project Order,
   etc.) has expired, the agency providing the goods or services cannot use any remaining
   unexpended balances to apply against new requirements (CG Decision B-286929, 25 April
   01). Under the BFNR, the balance of a fixed-term appropriation is available only for payment
   of expenses properly incurred during the period of availability or to complete contracts made
   within that period. Once the obligation period has expired, new obligations are chargeable to
   current year funds even if a continuing need arose during the prior period, except for within-
   scope changes to the original contract.
5.6. Other Types of Air Force Orders. Per DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, General Accounting and
Finance Systems at Base Level, Chapter 17, these include orders placed with another DoD
component that has single service acquisition responsibility and binding agreements between
government agencies, or orders placed by law.
   5.6.1. Reimbursable Order. This is an order for services, supplies, material, or equipment
   placed by an Air Force component to a procuring component that obligates its own funds to
   fill the order and obtains reimbursement from the requiring component. Record these orders
   as an obligation when the procuring component accepts the reimbursable order in writing.
   See paragraph 5.5.1 for exceptions.
   5.6.2. Direct Cite Order. Same as paragraph 5.6.1 above except the procuring agency
   obligates the requiring Air Force component‘s funds. Record these orders as obligations
   when notified in writing the execution of the procuring component‘s contract, project order,
   or purchase order, or when you receive a copy of such orders from the requiring agency.
   5.6.3. Project Orders. Consider these orders, specifically identified as project orders on the
   order itself, as a contract, and are issued on a reimbursable basis. Record these orders as
   obligations for the amount stated on the order when accepted in writing by the performing
   agency. 41 U.S.C., Section 23 (Project Order Law) applies. NOTE: DoDFMR 7000.14,
   Volume 11A, chapter 2, paragraph 020303 and DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, chapter 17, paragraph
   17-12., define agencies that are authorized to receive project orders as government-owned
   and government-operated (GOGO) establishments. Within AMC, there are no GOGO
   establishments; therefore AMC organizations cannot receive project orders from outside
   agencies for any required support. However, AMC organizations may issue project orders to
   GOGO agencies (e.g., range facilities, AFMC bases that operate specifically for providing
   support to other Air Force command organizations) whenever their services are required.
   Follow guidance in DFAS-DE 7010.1.R, chapter 17, for the proper recording of projects
   orders in the accounting system.
5.7. Reimbursement Targets. Load reimbursement targets to the extent you anticipate
earnings. You will receive no fund target from this headquarters for reimbursements; however,
you may load any valid amount and adjust the target up or down based on your actual
reimbursement earnings throughout the year. NOTE: At the end of the fiscal year, your
reimbursement target should match exactly (rounded to the nearest $100 if you prefer) to your
earned reimbursements.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        45


5.8. Medical Reimbursable Program. DoD 6010.15-M, Military Treatment Facility Uniform
Business Office (UBO) Manual contains billing procedures for medical and dental care received
in military MTFs. HQ USAF/SGMC annually provides MTFs, by message, the reimbursement
rates for the upcoming fiscal year. MTFs and Aeromedical Evacuation Units are involved in the
movement of those DoD and non-DoD category patients who are authorized to travel in the
aeromedical evacuation system. The cost of movement of these authorized patients is
reimbursable by HQ AMC/SG; the cost of medical care is reimbursable to HQ AMC/SG. MTFs
will ensure the proper identification of patients and non-medical attendants and will also provide
addresses to the Global Patient Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC) for billing and
collections.
5.9. The ―Miscellaneous Receipts‖ Statute. Codified in 31 U.S.C., Section 3302(b), this
statute basically states that any United States government agent or official who receives money
for the United States government from any source shall deposit the money in full to the Treasury.
This means deposited into the general fund of the Treasury and not into the agency‘s own
appropriations, even though the agency‘s appropriations may be technically still ―in the
Treasury‖ until the agency actually spends them. The term ―miscellaneous receipts‖ does not
refer to any single account in the Treasury, but to a number of receipt accounts under the heading
of ―General Fund‖ listed in the Treasury Department‘s ―Federal Account Symbols and Titles‖
publication. Absent from statutory law to the contrary, you should process reimbursement
transactions as a miscellaneous receipt. To receive the money back requires a direct
appropriation from Congress.
   5.9.1. The Comptroller General (46 CompGen 31 (1966)) has ruled that if an agency retains
   and credits its own appropriation any funds it should have deposited to the General Fund of
   the Treasury, this would amount to an improper augmentation of the agency‘s appropriation
   (31 U.S.C., Section 1301(a)), even though the agency uses a no-year appropriation
   (excluding revenues received by Working Capital Funds for the sale of goods or services).
   Exceptions to the miscellaneous receipts rule fall into two broad categories, statutory and
   nonstatutory:
       5.9.1.1. Statutory. An agency may retain funds it receives if it has the statutory authority
       to do so.
       5.9.1.2. Nonstatutory. Credit to an appropriation any receipts that qualify as
       ―repayments‖ to an appropriation, and not to the General Fund of the Treasury as a
       miscellaneous receipt.
   5.9.2. Repayments. The term ―repayments‖ fall into two classes: (1) reimbursements from
   outside sources for goods or services furnished, or furnished at a later date, and by law
   credited directly to appropriations, and (2) refunds to appropriations from outside sources for
   payments made in error, overpayments, or adjustments for previous amounts disbursed,
   including returns of authorized advances.
   5.9.3. Excessive Reprocurement Costs. In contract issues, excessive reprocurement costs
   include two factually different but conceptually related situations:
       5.9.3.1. When the original contractor defaults and the work is still required, and a second
       contractor completes the work at a cost higher than the original price. The original
46                                                             AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


     contractor is liable to the government for the cost increases, or ―excessive reprocurement
     costs.‖
     5.9.3.2. Additional costs are incurred to correct defective work performed by the original
     contractor, for which the contractor is liable.
  5.9.4. Disposition of Amounts Recovered. This depends upon the timing of recovery in
  relation to the reprocurement or corrective action and the status of the applicable
  appropriation. The object is to avoid the depletion of currently available appropriations to
  obtain what the government is to receive under the original obligation. A summary of the
  rules follows and applies equally to default and defective work situations:
     5.9.4.1. If, at the time of recovery from the original contractor, the additional expense
     has not transpired, the agency retains the amounts recovered to the extent necessary to
     fund the reprocurement or corrective measures. Credit the collection to the appropriation
     obligated for the original contract, without regard to the status of that appropriation.
     5.9.4.2. If, at the time of recovery from the original contractor, the additional
     reprocurement or corrective obligation has already occurred, credit the recovery amounts
     to the applicable appropriation, to the extent necessary to reimburse itself, if that
     appropriation is still available for obligation. If the appropriation is no longer available
     for obligation, deposit the recovery into miscellaneous receipts.
     5.9.4.3. For no-year appropriations (e.g., TWCF), retain amounts recovered as a refund
     regardless when the recovery was made. Do not deposit excess reprocurement cost
     recoveries related to no-year appropriation activities into miscellaneous receipts.
  5.9.5. Damage to Government Property and Other Tort Liability. Do not credit amounts
  recovered for loss or damage to government property to the appropriation available to repair
  or replace the property. Deposit these recoveries to the General Fund of the Treasury as
  miscellaneous receipts, unless statutory exceptions exist to the contrary (see last sentence of
  this paragraph for depositing recoveries for damages to real property). Public Law 104-106
  amended 10 U.S.C., Section 2782 (Damage to Real Property; Disposition of Amounts
  Recovered) to allow for amounts recovered for claims resulting from damage to real property
  to be credited to the appropriation account of the organization responsible for the repair or
  replacement of the real property at the time of recovery. However, legislative restriction still
  prevents the availability of these collections for future obligation or expenditure until
  specifically authorized by Congress in an appropriation, pending a change in public law. This
  means you cannot utilize these funds unless Congress reappropriates them to the Air Force
  (as a general rule, this does not occur). DFAS-DE/ALA provided the proper collection
  procedures of claims for real property recoveries in their message, 041500Z Nov 97 (Subject:
  Amounts Recovered for Damage to Real Property: Exceptions).
     5.9.5.1. For claims recoveries relating to loss, damage, or destruction to Military Family
     Housing (MFH) caused by abuse or neglect, deposit these amounts to the DoD MFH
     Management Account (57*7045) as a refund in accordance with AFI 51-502, Personnel
     and Government Recovery Claims, chapter 4, paragraph 4.14.2., and AFI 65-601,
     Volume 1, chapter 5, paragraph 5.12.22.
     5.9.5.2. If the damaged real property is a TWCF-assigned facility, and the repair will be
     accomplished by contract (not in-house), deposit the funds received for the claim into
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         47


       TWCF as an appropriation refund in accordance with AFI 51-502, chapter 4, paragraph
       4.14.3. and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 5, paragraph 5.12.21.
   5.9.6. For all other non-real property claims recoveries, deposit these amounts to the General
   Fund of the Treasury as a miscellaneous receipt, except for those that involve property under
   the control of TWCF. NONSTATUTORY EXCEPTION: When a private party responsible
   for the loss or damage to government non-real property agrees to replace it in kind or have it
   repaired to the satisfaction of the appropriate authorities and to make payment directly to the
   party making the replacement or repairs, the arrangement is permissible and the agency (Air
   Force unit) is not required to transfer an amount equal to the cost of replacement or repair to
   miscellaneous receipts. If the private party makes payment directly to the installation in lieu
   of replacement in kind or repair, deposit these funds as a miscellaneous receipt.
   5.9.7. The mere failure to deposit any applicable funds into the General Fund of the U.S.
   Treasury, Miscellaneous Receipts Account, does not create an antideficiency act (ADA)
   violation because such a credit entry to the base O&M account can be treated as an
   accounting error and corrected. However, if these receipts are erroneously deposited to the
   O&M account and subsequently spent to cover annual O&M expenditures, an ADA violation
   may have occurred if the base O&M expenditures/obligations exceeded the amount properly
   available to the O&M account.
   5.9.8. Please refer to the GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume II,
   chapter 6, Section E. (Augmentation of Appropriations), for further information regarding the
   ―miscellaneous receipts‖ statute.
5.10. Joint Use Agreements with Civilian Airports. AMC bases who are responsible for
maintaining aircraft runways under a joint use agreement with a civilian airport authority must
not permit the reduction of the Air Force‘s share of revenues from anticipated civil aircraft
landing fees (credited as a reimbursement to the Air Force appropriation available for that fiscal
year for the operation and maintenance of the airfield) to offset costs for the airport authority to
directly contract for any maintenance or repair of the joint use runway. Since AMC bases would
be responsible for these sustainment costs from its own O&M 3400 appropriation, it is not
considered an improper augmentation of these funds in accordance with the FY 2001 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 387. Use PE 48532F and sales code 90C to record
these reimbursements into the accounting system. (See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume
5.11. Acceptance and Use of Landing Fees from Civil Aircraft at AMC Bases. The FY 2011
NDAA (Public Law 111-383), Section 387 made permanent the authority to accept and use
landing fees collected from civil aircraft at domestic military airfields, whether prescribed in a
fee schedule (see AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, paragraph 12, table 3.) or
imposed under a joint-use agreement, to recover costs incurred for use by civil aircraft of an
airfield of the military department in the United States or its territories or possessions. These
amounts shall be credited as a reimbursement to the appropriation available for that fiscal year,
for the operation and maintenance of the airfield and shall be made available to the base for the
same period and purpose, as the appropriation is available. Record these reimbursements in the
accounting system against Sales Code 90C and the assigned PEC of the organization that
provides airfield support (e.g., Civil Engineer, Airfield Management, etc.), based on the
discretion of the installation commander. AMC bases will report these collections annually to
HQ AMC/FMAO in accordance with guidelines provided by SAF/FMB. For AMC bases with a
 48                                                              AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


TWCF mission, do not collect these landing fees into the TWCF appropriation. (See AMCS1 to
AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 7.12.4.)
5.12. Gifts to the Air Force. Gift offers from private agencies/individuals are presented as
either conditional or unconditional and may be rejected if it is clearly in the best interests of the
Air Force. Accepted unconditional monetary gifts are deposited into Miscellaneous Receipt
Account 571299 and accepted conditional monetary gifts are deposited into Trust Fund Receipt
Account 578928. DFAS-DE/ADRA, through SAF/FMB, will issue a funding document citing
appropriation 57X8928, Fund Code 75, when reallocating conditional monetary gifts to the
MAJCOM for which the gift is intended. HQ AMC/FMAO (Funds Control) will issue a separate
funding document to the appropriate base. AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force,
provides additional guidance on the proper acceptance of gifts. (See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601,
Volume 1, paragraph 4.65.)
5.13. TWCF Sale of Services Other than Airlift. See AMCI 65-602, chapter 3, paragraph 3.2.
5.14. Anticipated Reimbursements. Establish a reimbursable MORD (AF Form406,
Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document) in the accounting system for
anticipated uncollected reimbursements, regardless of the source (government or contractor), as a
Filled Customer Order Uncollected (FCOU). This stage of accounting provides a budgetary
resource. When the actual reimbursement is collected by DFAS, the transaction will move from
FCOU to Filled Customer Order Collected (FCOC). Do not process an anticipated
reimbursement as a negative MORD (negative AEU) in the accounting system.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         49


                                           Chapter 6

                                  MILITARY PERSONNEL

6.1. General Information. There are two ways to account for costs associated with the Military
Personnel Appropriation (MPA); HQ USAF manages the actual payments charged to the MPA
(i.e., pay, permanent change of station (PCS) travel) and charging each work center at base level
for military labor based upon a standard rate. These are composite rates that provide for basic
pay, incentive and special pay, PCS costs, retirement costs, and certain allowances and
miscellaneous expenses for active duty personnel. DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, Chapter 30, contains the
standard rates for each military rank.
   6.1.1. Use these standard rates to compute military costs as a cost element for DoD
   programming, budgeting and accounting, and for reimbursements from non-DoD agencies.
   Once you determine that military labor is properly reimbursable (reference DoDI 4000.19),
   apply these standard rates accordingly. For nonfederal reimbursable customers, these
   standard rates are accelerated to recover retirement, leave and holiday, and other personnel
   costs (quarters, subsistence, medical, etc.). The acceleration factor for leave and holiday costs
   is applicable only when you determine the reimbursements on time actually worked (i.e.,
   when the receiving activity does not otherwise pay for the personnel costs incurred by DoD
   during leave and holiday periods). DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, chapter 30, contains these
   accelerated factors. Record all reimbursements for military labor to the MPA. Use available
   cost accounting systems to compute billings, such as IWIMS, in lieu of the standard costs.
   6.1.2. Include military personnel costs relating to base support you provide to tenants in your
   support agreement costs. Use AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, for
   military personnel composite rates in your cost allocation calculations.
   6.1.3. Expense authority for standard military rates is automatically provided in amounts
   equal to actual expenses. Do not establish targets for base level purposes.
   6.1.4. Although base-level managers infrequently apply the MPA to finance operating costs,
   you may use it under the following circumstances:
       6.1.4.1. PCS with TDY En Route. Charge TDY costs directly related to PCS movement
       to the MPA provided the TDY does not exceed 15 days and the TDY is for M-16
       training, briefings, or special instructions.
       6.1.4.2. Escorts for Military Prisoners/Inmates. Per AFI 31-205, The Air Force
       Correction System, chapter 9, paragraph 9.9., when an organization is required to provide
       an escort for a military inmate/prisoner for the purpose of transferring the member from
       an Air Force installation to a regional corrections facility for continued confinement, the
       inmate‘s parent unit is responsible to provide a travel/per diem fund cite to the escort
       member‘s unit. If an organization is required to provide an escort to bring an
       apprehended military member to an Air Force installation pending further sentencing, the
       escort‘s unit of assignment will fund the travel/per diem costs of the escort and the
       MILPERS centrally managed allotment (CMA) account (591.01) will fund the travel and
       expenses for apprehended Air Force members and the MILPERS of the appropriate
       military department will fund travel and expenses for their assigned apprehended
       members (see also AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 12, paragraph 12.7.4.).
 50                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


       6.1.4.3. Payment for Rewards and Apprehension, Detention, and Delivery of Absentees,
       Deserters, and Escaped Prisoners. Under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 956, charge these costs
       to the appropriate Service MILPERS appropriation of the apprehended member‘s military
       department (i.e., Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines; for Air Force, charge to CMA account
       591.02) in accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 12, paragraph 12.7.5., AFI
       36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence, chapter 3, paragraph 3.5., and DoDFMR
       7000.14, Volume 10, Contract Payment Policy and Procedures, chapter 12, paragraph
       120110. The latter reference provides additional payment guidance and the Service
       appropriations to charge for these rewards, or reimbursement for actual expenses not to
       exceed $75.00.
6.2. Clothing Allowance. Clothing Allowance for Air Force Officer and Enlisted Members:
   6.2.1. Civilian Clothing Monetary Allowance. Air Force policy is that enlisted personnel
   work in uniform, but there are times when they must wear civilian clothes while on duty
   (AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel). When wearing
   civilian clothes is optional, a civilian clothing allowance is not paid. Civilian clothing
   allowances are payable when required in the performance of official duties, while TDY, and
   at designated permanent duty stations outside the CONUS. Do not use civilian clothing
   allowance as an incentive, compensation, or an inducement to solicit volunteers for a duty
   requirement. AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowances for Air Force Personnel, covers the types,
   quantities, conditions, and requirements for payment of the civilian clothing allowance.
   6.2.2. Uniform Clothing Allowances. DoD Directive 1338.5, Armed Forces Monetary
   Allowance Policy, establishes the clothing monetary allowance system. This system provides
   uniform clothing to active duty enlisted members of the Armed Forces and Reserve
   components on an Issue-In-Kind System. When clothing items are not issued to members,
   initial clothing monetary allowance is payable, which only covers the dollar value of required
   enlisted initial item clothing. Annual cash allowances are then payable to active duty enlisted
   members during the month (Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD)) of entry
   on active duty. The Department of Defense Pay Manual (DoDPM) contains the annual
   amounts. Military personnel assigned to special duties may be authorized extra clothing
   allowances. You should perform a careful review of AFI 36 3014 and AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 1, part 1, Basic Air Force Supply Procedures, chapter 17, and part 3, chapter 2, to
   determine entitlement to initial clothing allowances, clothing maintenance allowances, and
   extra clothing monetary allowances.
6.3. Resource Augmentation Duty (READY) Program. The normal clothing issue should
suffice to support the READY program. Provide any specialized articles from the on-hand assets
of the augmented agency. For items not on-hand or those deemed necessary by the training
agency, the augmented agency funds in lieu of the permanently assigned organization of the
trainee.
6.4. Mass Transit Subsidy. OSD Memorandum dated 13 Oct 00, Subject: Department of
Defense Transportation Incentive Program, Attachment 2, provides funding guidance and
payment procedures concerning the mass transit subsidy, inside and outside the National Capital
Region (implements Executive Order 13150, 4/21/00). For qualifying military personnel, this
subsidy is budgeted and paid from the MILPERS appropriation.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                    51


6.5. Lodging for Mission Essential Personnel. If the wing commander determines that certain
military personnel (e.g., group/squadron commanders, medical personnel) who reside off-base
are mission essential and directs them to temporarily reside on the base due to a national
emergency or other appropriate circumstance, the base civil engineer can approve a temporary
change to a VAQ, VOQ, or other lodging facility whose construction was initially financed with
appropriated funds (i.e., Military Construction (MILCON)) in accordance with AFI 32-9002,
Use of Real Property Facilities, chapter 2. The rooms will be designated as a contingency
dormitory and the members will not be required to pay for lodging and will continue to retain
their housing allowance. The Lodging Office will not provide any services (i.e., the members
will be responsible to clean the room, wash towels and linens when required, etc.). Per diem is
not allowable and members will continue to use their basic allowance for subsistence (BAS)
allowance to pay for meals consumed.
6.6. Partial Dislocation Allowance (PDLA or Partial DLA). See the JFTR, Volume 1,
paragraph U5630-B.15. Authorized payments are made from the MILPERS (3500) appropriation
for Air Force military personnel. Other Services (e.g., Army, Navy, Marines) and ANG/AFRC
personnel residing in Air Force base housing and who are entitled to PDLA are paid from their
respective Service MILPERS account.

                                            Chapter 7

                                      CIVILIAN PERSONNEL

7.1. Civilian Resource Management. AFI 36-502, Managing Civilian Personnel Resources,
describes responsibilities regarding civilian cost management. Installation commanders are
responsible to manage their total civilian force structure. This instruction provides commanders
flexibility to program funds to meet overall requirements in relation to civilian manpower
requirements and competing priorities. With civilian pay representing a high percentage of the
total AMC dollar allocation, utilize all available management techniques to ensure the proper use
of civilian resources.
7.2. Civilian Pay Program. The two factors that determine a civilian pay program are
authorizations and workyear costs. The methodologies used for determining authorizations are:
   7.2.1. Air Staff Methodology. SAF/FMBO determines workyears based on the number of
   authorizations in the Future Year Defense Plan (FYDP). They average end-strengths for the
   current and succeeding fiscal year to come up with AMC‘s workyears. This average provides
   half-year funding for any deletions or additions that occur during the fiscal year and provides
   the basis for the AMC work-year target provided by AF/A1.
   7.2.2. AMC Methodology. AMC calculates workyears using the SAF/FMBO formula except
   the AMC Unit Manpower Document (UMD) is used in lieu of the FYDP to determine the
   workyears for each AMC unit. HQ AMC/FMA uses the end of August UMD to average
   authorizations in the 4th quarter of the current fiscal year with authorizations in the 4th quarter
   of the succeeding fiscal year to arrive at the workyears for the new approaching fiscal year.
   This provides the latest data on unit authorizations before initial distribution or planning
   numbers go out to the field.
   7.2.3. Workyear Cost. The workyear cost represents the employee‘s salary plus the
   following benefits:
       7.2.3.1. Continuation pay.
       7.2.3.2. Cash awards.
       7.2.3.3. Night differential.
       7.2.3.4. Holiday pay.
       7.2.3.5. Sunday premium pay.
       7.2.3.6. Overtime pay.
       7.2.3.7. Suggestion and invention awards.
       7.2.3.8. Severance pay.
       7.2.3.9. Clothing allowance.
       7.2.3.10. Moving allowance.
       7.2.3.11. Hazard pay.
       7.2.3.12. Environmental pay.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         53


      7.2.3.13. Annual premium pay.
      7.2.3.14. Overseas differential.
      7.2.3.15. Quarters allowance.
      7.2.3.16. Lump sum leave.
      7.2.3.17. Retirement benefits (FICA, TSP, Annuity).
      7.2.3.18. Federal employee health benefits.
      7.2.3.19. Federal life insurance.
      7.2.3.20. Mass transit subsidy (if applicable).
   7.2.4. Since the workyear cost used in calculating initial distribution is based on your
   previous year‗s actual expenditures, funding for these benefits is in your workyear cost only
   to the extent incurred. Note: HQ AMC/FMA does not include one-time costs such as
   Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP) in your workyear costs. You must record
   these costs to EEICs 13012 (GS employees), 16012 (Foreign National Direct Hire
   employees), or 18012 (Wage Grade employees), as appropriate, or we will include them in
   your workyear cost, which forces us to estimate the reduction to your average workyear cost
   to arrive at a realistic number. It is extremely important you ensure proper expenditures and
   hours are input into the payroll system. Incorrect factors will skew your calculated workyear
   cost.
   7.2.5. HQ AMC/FMA will work with each base to arrive at an acceptable workyear cost.
   The only recognizable shortfall is VSIP payments. Each base is responsible for managing
   their civilian pay within the funded program.
7.3. Civilian Pay and Work-Year Utilization.
   7.3.1. The Air Staff tracks civilian pay and work-year utilization by command. They have
   established that any under-utilization of work-years or diversion of civilian pay is taken into
   consideration in determining command allocations of civilian pay and work-years for
   subsequent years. Avoid underutilization of work-years or civilian pay, and diversion of
   civilian pay to accommodate other perceived shortfalls. You must carefully monitor the
   utilization of work-years and civilian pay.
   7.3.2. It is essential for bases to manage this critical program from the beginning of the fiscal
   year. The management of a base‘s civilian hiring program is the responsibility of the Civilian
   Employment Cost Management Committee in conjunction with local funding policies
   established by the FMB.
   7.3.3. Civilian pay is a MAJCOM ―fenced‖ centrally managed program. The civilian pay
   program is managed at the BA level and you are expected to manage at that level while
   observing legal and administrative limitations. Funding cannot be realigned outside of
   civilian pay without prior approval from AMC/FMA. Civilian pay execution will be reviewed
   during the wing execution reviews.
   7.3.4. In calculating a base‘s civilian pay funding for any given year, the two source
   documents are the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) and the 1092 report. The information
 54                                                              AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   contained in the UMD is usually beyond the control of the FMA office, but not the data on
   the 1092 report.
7.4. Civilian Manpower and Funding Report. The Air Force Standard Civilian Automated
Pay System (AFSCAPS) produces the RCS DD-COMP(AR)1092, Civilian Manpower and
Funding Report, required to meet civilian employment cost reporting requirements. This report is
a significant tool in order to manage the civilian pay program. The accuracy of the 1092 report is
essential because it contains the base‘s data incorporated into the command‘s civilian workyear
cost, funded by SAF/FMB. Similarly, SAF/FMB uses this data to document civilian pay
requirements contained in the President‘s Budget. To the extent workyear costs are understated,
SAF/FMB will under fund the command‘s O&M program, resulting in a decrease to the base‘s
O&M funding. HQ AMC also uses this report to validate bases‘ unfunded civilian pay
requirements, for TWCF and O&M. Therefore, it is essential that all data reflected in the 1092
report be as accurate as possible.
7.5. Civilian Employment Cost Management Committee (CECMC).
   7.5.1. The objectives of the CECMC include (1) advising commanders on how to eliminate
   unnecessary civilian personnel costs and to determine the number of employees to hire based
   on mission requirements within funding availability, (2) identify potential personnel funding
   problems, and (3) present appropriate funding recommendations to the FMB.
   7.5.2. The CECMC ensures the use of civilian resources efficiently and effectively. This
   corporate board is responsible for making decisions in regard to lapses (the length of time
   vacated positions are normally vacant), overhire requirements, etc., by taking into
   consideration manpower authorizations, funding priorities, employment capability, salaries,
   and intended cash award payments.
   7.5.3. The base commander or designated representative chairs the committee and its
   membership includes functional managers as well as representatives from civilian personnel,
   financial management, and manpower communities. Responsibilities of the CECMC include:
       7.5.3.1. Review of civilian resource operating budgets.
       7.5.3.2. Periodic review of employment plans and comparison of civilian pay expenses
       against budgetary targets, to include any reallocation or redistribution of funds.
       7.5.3.3. Establishment and continuous review of local civilian resource management.
7.6. (DELETED)
7.7. Mass Transit Subsidy. OSD memorandum dated 13 Oct 00, Subject: Department of
Defense Transportation Incentive Program, Attachment 2, provides funding guidance and
payment procedures concerning the mass transit subsidy, inside and outside the National Capital
Region (implements Executive Order 13150, 4/21/00). For qualifying civilian personnel, this
subsidy is budgeted and paid from the same appropriation and PE code used to pay their salaries.
Use EEICs 12121 (GS employees), 15921 (Foreign National Direct Hire employees), and 17921
(Wage Grade employees), as appropriate, for all mass transit subsidy payments. For
nonappropriated fund (NAF) employees, the employing nonappropriated fund instrumentality
(NAFI) will reimburse the cost of the mass transit subsidy and they may seek APF
reimbursement at the installation level, if approved by the installation commander.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       55


7.8. New Manpower Authorizations for Reimbursable Activities. New authorizations for
reimbursable activities, like Military Family Housing (MFH), must have MAJCOM POC
concurrence prior to approval of the authorization. This allows the functional area to ensure they
have funds available to properly reimburse the O&M account without having a negative effect on
their funding programs.

                                            Chapter 8

      TEMPORARY DUTY (TDY) TRAVEL, PER DIEM, CIVILIAN PERMANENT
            CHANGE OF STATION (PCS), AND VEHICLE RENTAL

8.1. General Information. TDY costs consist of per diem (meals, lodging, and incidental
expenses), transportation (mileage, air fare (commercial or TWCF), bus fare, etc.), and other
authorized reimbursable expenses (rental vehicle, toll charges, parking fees, etc.). There is no
definitive set of rules on what is considered a legitimate valid TDY versus an invalid one. That is
the organizational commander‗s call – prudent judgment is the key. Each organizational
commander has the responsibility to ensure the productive use of TDY funds and must answer
the auditors in the event a question surfaces concerning the propriety of a particular TDY.
Commanders should encourage their travelers to turn in copies of their paid travel vouchers,
noted with air transportation costs, to the organization's TDY funds manager. Funds managers
are encouraged to track TDY expenses, specifically note the reasonableness of actual expenses
and rental costs as compared to estimates, and reconcile obligations shown on RCM Cost Center
Report with the accounting records.
8.2. TDY Per Diem Policy Overview. HQ USAF/DPP message 160910Z Mar 98 contains the
basic TDY per diem policy, provided as follows:
   8.2.1. The State Department establishes per diem rates for foreign OCONUS locations; the
   General Services Administration (GSA) establishes per diem rates for CONUS locations; and
   the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee (PDTATAC) establishes per
   diem rates for non-foreign OCONUS locations. GSA reviews CONUS rates annually and
   usually releases new rates effective the 1st of January of every year. The State Department
   reviews overseas rates monthly to compensate for currency or data changes. Data is compiled
   from surveys completed by country and embassy representatives. If any per diem rate is
   inadequate, the local commander requests a review of the current per diem rate by following
   the instructions in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations, Volume 1 (JFTR), paragraph U4140.
   8.2.2. The order approving official authorizes or approves TDY based on mission
   requirements (JFTR, paragraph U2115.). The order approving official is responsible for
   determining the required transportation mode (JFTR, paragraph U3002.), whether additional
   authorizations are necessary (e.g., rental car (JFTR, chapters 3 and 4)), availability of
   government quarters and meals (JFTR, chapter 4, Part E), and other specific reporting
   instructions. Based on this information, the order approving official directs order preparation
   and authorizes the appropriate meal option and transportation requirements. Order approving
   officials can obtain service provided government quarters and dining facility availability
   information by contacting their resource advisor (RA), and the FMA office.
   8.2.3. TDY Options. Per JFTR, chapter 4, the three most common options are:
       8.2.3.1. Regular TDY. The order approving official selects one of the following meal
       options based on meal availability listed in AFMAN 34-255, Directory of Government
       Quarters and Dining Facilities. NOTE: Meal availability is not based on the member‘s
       rank, position, or desires.
           8.2.3.1.1. Government meals are available and directed.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       57


         8.2.3.1.2. Government meals are not available or directed.
         8.2.3.1.3. Use of proportional per diem rate (PPD) directed (only if government
         dining facilities are available at the TDY location). Note: If mission requirements
         preclude eating one or two meals a day in the dining facility, then PPD is appropriate.
         Full or PPD should never be authorized for the purpose of traveler convenience. See
         HQ AMC/FM memorandum dated 19 Dec 03, Subject: Proper Use of Proportional
         Per Diem (PPD) for TDY Travel, for additional guidance.
     8.2.3.2. Field Duty. Members under this option receive no per diem everything normally
     associated with per diem provided at no charge to the member.
     8.2.3.3. Essential Unit Messing (EUM). When the Service Secretary concerned or, for a
     Joint Task Force (JTF), the CINC or JTF commander determines that government
     messing is essential to accomplish training and readiness, EUM is declared (JFTR,
     paragraph U4125-A3E.). This entitles members to receive the incidental expense rate
     CONUS $2.00 per day, for OCONUS, the incidental expense rate listed in the JFTR,
     Appendix B, or $3.50 per day when the order issuing authority determines $3.50 is
     adequate for anticipated incidental expenses.
  8.2.4. Changes to Meal Option. The order issuing official is responsible for selecting the
  appropriate meal option prior to preparation of the TDY orders. However, there may be
  circumstances where the meal option selected turns out to be inappropriate and, in these
  cases, the order approving official may change the meal option. It is important to remember a
  meal option resulting in a reduced entitlement cannot be made retroactive, except for a
  deductible meal. See JFTR, paragraph U4125-AG3. for additional guidance.
     8.2.4.1. Meal Option Change that Results in an Increased Per Diem Rate. If, at any point
     the meal option selected was insufficient, change it to reflect the proper meal option.
     Base this change on the nonavailability of meals (missed meals), e.g., the traveler‘s
     orders direct government messing; however, due to the work schedule they miss a meal.
     Upon return, the order issuing official would annotate the order with the appropriate meal
     option, in this case the proportional meal rate. If a deployed member is in support of a
     JTF, missed meals are tracked using the AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect –
     Use of Government Facilities. The deployed commander approved nonavailability of
     directed meals. The member submits this information when filing their travel voucher.
     8.2.4.2. Meal Option Change that Results in a Decreased Per Diem Rate. If, during the
     TDY, a different meal option becomes applicable, the order issuing official may direct a
     new meal option using a current or future effective date. Annotate the TDY orders with
     the new direction and effective date. Example: The order issuing official authorizes the
     locality rate, due to the nonavailability of a dining facility at the TDY location. The order
     issuing official receives notification that the dining facility is now available. Using this
     information and a review of the mission requirements, the order issuing official could
     decide to direct the member to use government mess. If the order issuing official
     determines the government mess would meet the mission requirements, the TDY traveler
     would be briefed that government meals are available and directed and will become
     effective on a current or future date. Upon return, the order issuing official annotates the
     orders with the appropriate directed meal option and date directed. It is important to
     remember not to change the meal option to reflect a retroactive decrease in entitlement.
58                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


     Example: Member‘s TDY orders are silent on meal direction. Upon return from TDY, the
     order approving official states the orders are incorrect and the government dining facility
     at the TDY location was the appropriate meal option. The member would still receive the
     locality rate since the TDY is complete and the change required would result in a
     retroactive reduction.
  8.2.5. TDY Members Directed To Use Government Mess and Quarters. If the TDY member
  is unable to occupy government quarters at the TDY installation due to nonavailability, they
  are entitled to the full locality per diem rate for the TDY area. The order issuing official
  cannot direct members quartered off-installation to use the government mess at the TDY
  installation, as it is considered not available.
  8.2.6. Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Deployments. Due to the similarity of AEF
  deployments to JTF deployments, Air Force policy allows the TDY commander to change
  the meal option if determined inappropriate for the deployment. The procedures in
  paragraph 8.2.4 above apply, with the exception of inserting the TDY commander in place
  of the order approving official. This policy does not take the place of establishing reporting
  instructions for the deployed location; instead, it allows a method of fixing current
  deployment inequities.
  8.2.7. Reporting Instructions. A common problem arises when ordering different TDY
  travelers to perform the same duty, at the same location, but authorized different meal
  options. To avoid differences between commands and services, we recommend developing
  reporting instructions specific to each TDY location tasked by HQ AMC or any other
  command or tasking authority. The suggestive instruction should include the following:
  Availability of messing facilities and appropriate meal option, availability of government
  quarters, and any restrictions imposed on the availability of the above due to mission or work
  schedules. This information allows commands and order approving officials to properly
  prepare TDY orders as the order approving official, who determines the option believed to
  meet the mission requirements, may not be fully aware of the availability of meals in a
  particular TDY environment for a particular mission. Reporting instructions help clear up
  this confusion and ensure equity between TDY members.
  8.2.8. Incidental Expense Rate. The authorized incidental expense rate when members are
  TDY OCONUS and lodged on a United States military installation is $3.50 per day. The
  same is also true for non-directed government mess. Effective 1 Apr 98, order approving
  officials determine if the $3.50 incidental expense rate is not adequate and can authorize the
  incidental expense rate listed in the JFTR, Appendix B.
  8.2.9. Deductible Meals. Per the JFTR, paragraph U4125-A3G, a deductible meal is a meal
  (1) made available pursuant to an agreement between a Uniformed Service and any
  organization, if the order directs use of the facility providing the meals, (2) included in a
  registration fee ultimately paid for by the government, (3) furnished at no cost to the member
  by a school while attending a course of instruction, if the cost of the meal is ultimately paid
  for by the government, or (4) furnished by the government at no cost to the member.
  Personnel on TDY orders who have a deductible meal will receive the proportional per diem
  rate for each day when one or two meals are provided. If the government provides all three
  meals, the member receives the incidental expense rate only for each day he or she receives
  all daily meals. Box lunches, in-flight meals, rations furnished by the government on military
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     59


  aircraft, meals furnished on commercial aircraft, or by private individuals are not deductible
  meals. Government meals paid for by travelers and consumed in a government mess facility
  are also not a deductible meal for per diem purposes.
  8.2.10. JTF TDY. For reimbursement options of members TDY in support of a JTF, please
  refer to the JFTR, paragraph U4800.
  8.2.11. Invitational Travel Orders (ITO) for Non-U.S. Government Employees. The JTR,
  Appendix E, determines when an ITO may be authorized for private individuals who are not
  U.S. Government military or civilian employees. Government contractors are not considered
  government employees and may be issued ITO only on an exception basis when traveling
  under a contract that does not provide funding or reimbursement for travel and transportation
  costs. ITOs may not be used to authorize travel and transportation for Government
  contractors/contractor employees. Individuals providing a service under a contract with the
  Government should be provided a contractor Letter of Introduction (LOI) which must be
  signed by the Contracting Officer and include the name and address of the contractor‘s
  agency responsible for reimbursement so HQ AMC/FMFA can properly bill the contractor
  for the airlift transportation furnished. Another acceptable payment method is on a cash
  reimbursable basis.
  8.2.12. Purchase of Bottled Water. TDY personnel cannot claim bottled water purchases as a
  reimbursable miscellaneous expense on their settlement travel vouchers per the JFTR,
  paragraph U1010. and JTR, paragraph C1002. Do not authorize bottled water on travel
  orders.
     8.2.12.1. AMC units deploying to a location where the water supply is suspect to be
     unsafe for human consumption may purchase bottled water, as described in AMCS1 to
     AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.45.5.
     8.2.12.2. AMC aircrews transiting overseas locations may purchase bottled water where
     the water supply is unsafe or questionable (as determined by the Foreign Clearance Guide
     or other competent source). See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.45.5.1
     for additional guidance.
     8.2.12.3. Prudent judgment is essential when considering requests to purchase bottled
     water for the conditions described in paragraphs 8.2.12.1 and 8.2.12.2 above. See
     AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.45.5.2 for additional guidance.
  8.2.13. Travel of Aircrews on AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight (FA) Authorization. The AF
  Form 4327a is not and was never intended to be a travel order. It was developed to satisfy the
  requirements to AFI 11-401_ AMCSUP, Aviation Management, specifying that commanders
  will issue written authorizations documenting Air Force aircraft flights using the format
  selected by the MAJCOM. IAW AFI 65-103_AMCSUP, paragraphs 1.2.24.3 and 1.2.24.3.1,
  AMC aircrew members must use the Defense Travel System (DTS) for reimbursement of
  travel expenses when performing routine missions via DD Form 1610. The AF Form 4327a
  is no longer used as the sole vehicle for AMC aircrew members to receive travel
  reimbursement.

     members who are traveling to or deployed to a Combat Commander‘s AOR (e.g., USAF,
     US Central Command (CENTAF)) may be required to prepare the AF Form 2282 (see
     HQ AMC/FM memorandum dated 5 Jan 04, Subject: Policy on Missed Meals in the Area
     of Responsibility (AOR). If the AMC aircrew is attached to an expeditionary
     wing/group/squadron, there may be different procedures for the approval of adverse
     effects. All who are assigned to Field Duty must use the AF Form 2282, if claiming
     missed meals. A payment made without the appropriate certification, as required by AFI
     65-114 reference above, is invalid.
  8.2.14. Permissive TDY (PTDY). Unit-funded space-required travel is authorized for
  members participating in sports tournaments if it is pre-approved by HQ AFSVA/SVPAF
  (AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, table 7, rule 33). The members can take a
  government vehicle if one is available but they cannot be reimbursed for fuel consumed. The
  same holds true if they take a privately owned vehicle. Travel orders are required but per
  diem is not authorized. Members must file a no-pay due travel voucher upon return to home
  station unless they are authorized reimbursement for actual travel costs. AFI 36-3003, table
  7., also provides guidance on what other types of events qualify for PTDYs. For these
  conditions, do not approve unit-funded travel orders unless specifically authorized. Do not
  authorize PTDY for official business for which funded TDY is appropriate (AFI 36-3003,
  paragraph 12.3.2.).
  8.2.15. Recalling Military Members from Leave. If members are ordered TDY while on
  leave, they are paid in accordance with JFTR, paragraph U4105-F. If members are recalled
  from leave to their permanent duty station, they are paid in accordance with JFTR, paragraph
  U7220.
  8.2.16. Spouse/Family Member Travel.
     8.2.16.1. Consult AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, paragraph 2.8., DoDD 4500.56,
     DoD Policy on the Use of Government Aircraft and Air Travel, enclosure 2, paragraph
     E2.5., AFI 65-103_AMCSUP paragraph 4.3.2, and the JFTR, Volume 1, appendix E,
     paragraph 13, for funding and approval authority guidance concerning spouse or any
     other family member travel. The following circumstances require MAJCOM approval for
     spouse TDY to attend:
         8.2.16.1.1. Numbered Air Force commander‘s visits to their bases (usually limited to
         two trips per year).
         8.2.16.1.2. Wing commanders‘/senior enlisted advisors‘ annual conferences.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       61


         8.2.16.1.3. Squadron commander orientations (limited to one trip during the
         sponsor‘s tenure as a squadron commander)
         8.2.16.1.4. Other instances, where there is an unquestionable official requirement in
         which the spouse is actually to participate in the function requiring the travel or it is
         deemed in the National interest because of a diplomatic or public relations benefit to
         the country.
     8.2.16.2. The Air Force Chief of Staff, in a memorandum dated 7 Mar 02, Subject:
     Delegation of Authority for Spouse/Family Member Funded Travel, delegates the
     approval authority to the MAJCOMs for all spouse/family member travel within their
     command, with the following limitations:
         8.2.16.2.1. The Vice Commander cannot approve his/her own spouse/family member
         travel or the MAJCOM Commander spouse/family member travel. The MAJCOM
         commander may self-approve per DoDD 4500.56.
         8.2.16.2.2. ITOs are authorized for funding transportation only and the orders must
         reflect a statement to that effect, as specified in the JTR, Volume II, appendix E, part
         I, paragraph A.13. In limited instances where per diem and other actual expenses are
         to be paid, prior approval from the Air Force Chief of Staff is required.
         8.2.16.2.3. Each spouse/family member travel request must be forwarded
         individually for MAJCOM approval. ITO ‗blanket‖ travel approval will not be issued.
         8.2.16.2.4. Justification and record of all approvals will be retained for two years at
         MAJCOM level.
  8.2.17. Attendance at Professional Military Education (PME) Graduation Ceremonies. Refer
  to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.2.9. for funding guidance. Friends,
  coworkers, and military spouses of PME graduates are not authorized PTDY to attend
  graduation ceremonies per AFI 36-3003, paragraph 12.8.5.
  8.2.18. Retention of Promotional Items While TDY. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10,
  paragraph 10.2.4. This guidance does not apply to promotional items offered for travel using
  funds other than those of a government agency, as defined in the JFTR/JTR, appendix A.
  8.2.19. Home Day Care Providers. These individuals are not NAF or Federal employees.
  Use ITOs to send Home Day Care Providers to attend required training sessions in a TDY
  status, with the approval of the Services commander. (JTR, appendix E, part I, paragraph
  A.3.)
  8.2.20. TDY to Receive Corneal Refractive Surgery. Per HQ USAF/SG memorandum dated
  20 Aug 03, Subject: The USAF ―Warfighter‖ Corneal Refractive Surgery (CRS) Program
  (Includes Both Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) and Laser-In-Situ-Keratomileusis
  (LASIK) (SG Policy Letter #03-002)), permissive TDY is authorized for those military
  members approved to receive CRS who are not considered aviation and defined special duty
  personnel. Aviation and defined special duty personnel may travel on unit-funded TDY
  orders to receive PRK surgery if approved by proper medical authority and the TDY is
  approved by the member‘s unit commander. See HQ AMC/FM FY04 Policy Message #11,
  Subject: New Guidance on TDY Funding of Corneal Refractive Surgery (CRS) for Military
  Personnel, 14 Nov 03, for additional references and guidance.
 62                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   8.2.21. Providing TDY Funds to Other Air Force Organizations. See AFAFO/FMF
   memorandum dated 7 Mar 03, Subject: Procedures for Providing TDY Funding to Other Air
   Force Organizations, for guidance. A copy is available on the AMC/FM Budget Policy CoP
   at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AM-FM-BH-01 , under
   ―Budget Policy Memos and Other Files.‖
8.3. Types of Expenses on TDY Orders. Under the Simplified Accounting for Temporary
Duty Travel initiative, directed by DoD, the only authorized EEIC to record TDY costs is EEIC
409 or authorized 2-digit shred.
   8.3.1. DFAS translated the DoD Simplified Accounting for Temporary Duty Travel
   initiative to mean that you must account for any expense included in a TDY order or travel
   settlement voucher in EEIC 409 (or authorized 2-digit shred). This includes registration fees
   official (not morale calls to the member‘s home) phone charges, or any other authorized item
   paid on a travel voucher. If a base wishes to have these types of charges broken out
   separately and remain part of the unit‘s management information system, use a different
   commitment or obligating document (e.g., SF 182, Authorization, Agreement, and
   Certification of Training, SF 1164, Claims for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official
   Business, AF Form 9, Request for Purchase). The traveler will need to file two forms (travel
   voucher and other applicable form).
   8.3.2. Excess Baggage. The unit commander or tasking official authorizes excess baggage
   for TDY or PCS travelers on the member‘s travel orders. Use EEIC 409 or authorized 2-
   digit shred only to record these charges. If the tasking authority does not authorize excess
   baggage using their fund cite, the member‘s unit commander may authorize local unit funds
   on the travel orders.
8.4. TDY Funds Management. An important ingredient for successful management of TDY
funds is the involvement of each RCM and RA. These individuals should review each trip to
ensure the following:
   8.4.1. A minimum number of personnel travel per visit.
   8.4.2. Planning for the most economic mode of travel. The JFTR does not specify which
   mode of air transportation (i.e., military air versus commercial GSA City Pairs) is preferable.
   From an economic view, use military air if it is cheaper or directed by competent authority to
   meet specific mission requirements.
   8.4.3. Use economy or excursion air fares when military air is not available.
   8.4.4. Major airlines will offer discount rates that are cheaper than coach fares. The JFTR,
   section 1-34, and the Military Traffic Management Regulation, chapter 304, require the use
   of special, reduced fares when practical. However, do not use these discounted fares if a GSA
   City Pair fare exists over the same route, as the government contracts for these fares with the
   commercial industry under this program. Use discounted fares if you cannot meet mission
   requirements within the available GSA City Pair fare for a particular route.
   8.4.5. Round trip excursion fares are generally available with confirmed reservations and
   tickets purchased at least 14 days before departure, a maximum of two stopovers (including
   scheduled destination), and the travel period is at least 7 but not more than 30 days.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     63


   8.4.6. There may be a penalty imposed for canceling or changing a reservation made to take
   advantage of the excursion rate.
   8.4.7. Use government quarters (either on-base lodging or contract quarters) at the TDY
   location, if available. The JFTR, paragraph U4400A.7., gives a government traveler the
   authority to bypass using available government quarters during periods of TDY or delay of
   less than 24 hours. Paragraph U4415. of the JFTR, applies only to the member's statement of
   use as distinguished from availability of government quarters at all times, including periods
   of TDY or delay of less than 24 hours.
   8.4.8. Control the use of Blanket Travel Orders (BTO). Issue BTOs only to individuals who
   travel frequently on short notice. Review and revise travel estimates to reflect actual
   obligations before the end of each reporting period, to the best extent possible. Close out
   BTOs no later than 31 August of the current fiscal year (except for HQ AMC/IG - see
   paragraph 8.20.6 below). All BTOs must state: ―Government meals are available and
   directed.‖ Any meal statements that increase the entitlement will be endorsed upon return of
   the member. NOTE: The requirements for BTOs will cease when the Defense Travel System
   (DTS) is fielded and implemented.
   8.4.9. TDYs in excess of 179 days, to include travel days, training days, and days at final
   destination, do not require a secretarial waiver. Per the JFTR, paragraph U2145., the six
   month limitation only applies to TDY assignments at any one location and not the total TDY
   period. Therefore, do not combine travel time and time at an en route location to the time a
   member is present at the final destination when applying the 179 day rule.
8.5. Unliquidated Travel Obligations. Follow-up of unliquidated travel obligations is the
responsibility of the FMA office; however, RCMs, RAs, and CCMs should play an active role.
Continual follow-up by financial managers helps to purify the accounting records and maximize
the use of operating funds. A joint effort results in aggressive follow-up.
8.6. Command Directed TDY.
   8.6.1. Annual programs for all funding points include requirements for both locally and
   command directed TDYs. As described in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph
   10.2.1., TDY (including command directed trips) is generally the funding responsibility of
   the unit of assignment. The following cases are exceptions:
       8.6.1.1. When O&M-assigned personnel are TDY-directed to augment AMC TWCF-
       assigned organizations for (1) C-5/C-17 aircrews, (2) C-5/C-17 airlift operations
       functions, (3) aerial port squadrons/units, and (4) C-5/C-17 aircraft maintenance
       units/squadron to perform a TWCF function, regardless if the TWCF-funded organization
       resides at HQ AMC, AMC wings/groups, or the Contingency Response Wing (CRW) or
       AMOG organizations, the augmented TWCF unit provides TWCF funds to the
       augmenting O&M organization to support the TDY. NOTE: Not all organizations that
       fall under the CRW are TWCF-assigned/funded; only those assigned positions with a
       48010 PE code on the CRW UMD belong to TWCF.
       8.6.1.2. When TWCF-assigned personnel augment an AMC O&M-funded organization
       to perform an O&M function, the augmented O&M organization provides O&M funds to
       the augmenting TWCF organization to support the TDY.
 64                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


       8.6.1.3. Exceptions described in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10.
       8.6.1.4. OT&E Test Participants. Use AMC Operational, Test, and Evaluation (OT&E)
       funds to pay for test participants. These funds are administered by HQ AMC/TE.
       8.6.1.5. DELETED.
       8.6.1.6. AFRC, ANG, and Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Augmentation.
       Travel and per diem costs of AFRC/ANG/IMA personnel on MPA man-days at the
       request of an active AMC unit is the funding responsibility of the AMC augmented unit.
       8.6.1.7. Manning Assistance. Fund manning assistance TDY conducted between an
       AMC unit and another AMC unit or a unit assigned to another MAJCOM in accordance
       with Air Force policy. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.2.5. A TDY
       tasking that benefits an overall AMC mission and not a specific organization remains a
       unit of assignment funding responsibility.
       8.6.1.8. Presidential and Vice Presidential Support. AMC organizations, particularly
       Security Forces and Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) personnel, may be tasked to
       provide TDY funding in support of the United States Secret Service (USSS) for missions
       supporting the President of the United States (POTUS) and the Vice President of the
       United States (VPOTUS). Use Air Force non-JCS ESP code RA (Romeo Alpha) to
       capture these costs. HQ AMC/FMA, in coordination with HQ AMC/A7R, will provide
       reimbursement to AMC Wings based on obligations captured with ESP code RA in the
       accounting system, if funding is available. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7,
       paragraph 7.55. for additional guidance.
   8.6.2. (DELETED)
   8.6.3. Requests for Contingency Shortfall. For contingency TDY requirements, HQ AMC
   will not honor unit requests for shortfall due to lack of funds. In these cases, it will become
   necessary to reprogram funds from other areas to pay for the contingency TDYs. In the
   event that reprogramming is not a viable option, the unit RA should contact the base FMA
   Officer, who will then work with the appropriate HQ AMC/FMA base analyst to seek
   necessary funding relief. The lack of funds is not a valid reason to shortfall any command
   directed TDY requirement.
   8.6.4. Maintenance Recovery Team (MRT) TDY Support. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601,
   Volume 1, paragraph 10.2.13. (and its subparagraphs) for funding guidance on MRT TDYs.
   For additional AMCS1 references on MRT funding for maintenance support of AFRC/ANG
   aircraft, see Chapter 9, paragraph 9.7 and Chapter 19, paragraph 19.28 of this publication.
   8.6.5. Escorts for Apprehended Military Inmates/Prisoners. See Chapter 6, paragraphs
   6.1.4.2 of this publication on paying for travel and expenses of escorts for apprehended
   military members.
8.7. Government Facilities. Use government facilities to the maximum extent possible,
including periods of delay or TDY of less than 24 hours (reference DFAS-DE interim guidance,
Procedures for Travel Accounting Operations, section 4 (formerly DFAS-DE 7010.3-R)).
8.8. DELETED.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       65


8.9. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) Travel Support. Subject Matter Specialists (SMS)
are selected by the MAJCOMs to fulfill Air Force directed requirements in support of the
Airman Promotion System. The Occupational Measurement Center should provide funding to
support this TDY travel.
8.10. Education Services Travel Support. Use TDY funds in PE 89732 for all civilian and
military personnel assigned to Base Education Services.
8.11. Senior NCO Academy (SNCOA), NCO Academy (NCOA) and Airman Leadership
School (ALS):
   8.11.1. Fund TDY costs for AMC students attending the SNCOA through an Air University
   fund citation listed in the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Education and
   Training Course Announcement (ETCA) web site, located at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
   8.11.2. Fund TDY costs for AMC students attending a CONUS NCO Academy through an
   Air University fund citation listed in the ETCA. For students attending an overseas NCO
   Academy, the member‘s unit of assignment will fund all TDY costs in accordance with AFI
   65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.3.3.3.
   8.11.3. Use RC/CC XX3340, PE 84751F for the operation of the ALS and TDY costs, if
   required.
8.12. Overseas School Travel to HQ Air Education and Training Command (AETC) or
HQ Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). Overseas travel to attend training schools funded
by HQ AETC or HQ AFMC. All travel and per diem costs for HQ AETC or HQ AFMC schools
under Air Force training or medical education programs (including from overseas stations to the
CONUS port and vice versa) should be funded by HQ AETC or HQ AFMC, respectively.
8.13. Continuing Health Education (CHE). In accordance with AFI 41-104, Professional
Board and National Certification, Air Force medical service personnel must use CHE to
maintain expertise in their area of professional endeavor and to fulfill license and certification
requirements. Account for TDY costs, as well as registration and tuition, in EEIC 409 if the
member pays them and reimbursed via a travel voucher. If the registration and tuition are paid
separately via AF Form 9, or SF 182, use EEIC 55806. Account for Emergency Medical
Technician training in EEIC 55803. The use of the Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) is
also authorized as a means of payment for CHE registration and/or tuition.
8.14. Phoenix Raven Teams and Other Mission Essential Ground Personnel
(MEGP). Phoenix Raven teams are security forces accompanying AMC aircraft and other
command‘s aircraft flying AMC missions for the purpose of providing force protection to the
aircraft at locations where security is inadequate or unknown. Other individuals accompanying
AMC aircraft required to perform special aircraft duties are known as Mission Essential Ground
Personnel (MEGP). See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.2.1.3. (and its
subparagraphs) for funding guidance for Phoenix Raven teams.
   8.14.1. Stewards. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.2.1.4. for funding
   guidance.
   8.14.2. Comptroller Paying Agents. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph
   10.2.1.5. for funding guidance.
8.15. Registration Fees.
 66                                                             AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   8.15.1. Only those expenses necessary to accomplish the purpose of attendance at meetings
   are properly reimbursable to the individual. The portion of registration fees that relate to
   entertainment, social events, and other personal items are not reimbursable, except when they
   are inseparable from attendance to the meeting (reference JFTR, Volume 1, and Comptroller
   General B-200650, April 86). Hospitality fees are borne by the individual and not paid
   directly out of appropriated funds.
   8.15.2. Individual membership fees and dues required for societies and associations are not
   payable from appropriated funds (APF) unless such payment is authorized by specific
   legislation. This does not prohibit an activity from paying membership dues from APF,
   provided membership is in the interest of the government and in the name of the activity, as
   opposed to the name of an individual (reference JFTR, paragraphs C4708. and U4535.).
   8.15.3. Do not assess registration fees to attendees at Air Force or AMC staff sponsored
   courses or conferences that do not come under the purview of the AFR 50-XXXX or AFI 36-
   XXXX series instructions.
8.16. Civilian Permanent Change of Station (PCS). Funding for civilian PCS is in
accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 22, paragraph 22.3., and the JFTR, Volume 2.
Generally, all civilian personnel PCS movement costs are borne from the operating funds
available to the activity gaining the employee (see above references for specific guidance).
Within AMC, the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) position the gaining employee fills
determines the type of funding used for the PCS movement. If the UMD position within the
gaining unit reflects a TWCF PE, use TWCF funds for the PCS move. If the UMD position is
O&M PE-coded, then O&M funds apply.
8.17. Vehicle Rental.
   8.17.1. The host base is generally responsible for providing in-house transportation. When
   vehicle requirements exceed in-house capability, the host is also responsible for renting
   vehicles to supplement host requirements. Tenant activities are responsible for vehicle rental
   to supplement tenant requirements.
   8.17.2. Personnel (other than HQ AMC teams) TDY to AMC units who require vehicle
   support should advise the visiting unit in advance of those requirements. If the host's in-
   house capability cannot support those requirements, then the visiting personnel should either
   (1) provide an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization or (2) include vehicle rental in the
   TDY orders. The organization visited is not responsible for vehicle rental funding for visiting
   TDY personnel.
   8.17.3. HQ AMC teams (other than IG) visiting active duty AMC units should notify the
   visited unit of their vehicle requirements. The visiting team will fund rental requirements that
   exceed in-house capability. Use vehicle substitutions (e.g., pickup trucks versus staff cars) to
   the maximum extent possible to reduce rental costs.
   8.17.4. Insurance for Rental Vehicles. See AMCSUP1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph
   10.2.16.
8.18. Centralized Witness TDY Funding. Funding for centralized witness travel associated
with military administrative boards, investigations, and disciplinary procedures (e.g., courts
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     67


martial) is in accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, table 10.2. and paragraph
10.16., and AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, Chapter 6.
8.19. PCS with TDY En Route or TDY Incident to PCS. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10,
paragraph 10.3.4.5. provides funding guidance. Since AMC does not have a CMA account for
AMC-imposed training incident to PCS, use the following procedures to obtain the proper fund
citation (O&M or TWCF) for newly assigned or gained personnel. See the ETCA web site
reference in paragraph 8.11.1 of this publication for additional details.
   8.19.1. Aircrew Training. AETC no longer funds for KC-135 or C-130 training courses; unit
   funding applies. For all aircrew training, when both the losing and gaining unit belong to
   AMC, obtain the TDY fund cite from the member‘s gaining unit of assignment. This is also
   applicable to TDY training out and back prior to departing PCS.
   8.19.2. Offshore En Route Maintenance Training. When an individual assigned to a non-
   AMC unit receives a PCS assignment to an AMC offshore maintenance unit with a TDY en
   route, HQ AMC/ A1X/A4MMT should provide, within the tasking message, the TDY fund
   cite of the gaining organization (for TWCF gained units) or a HQ AMC/FMA fund cite (for
   O&M gained units) to the servicing CBPO of the losing unit. Provide a copy of the AMC
   tasking message to the gaining unit and servicing FMA (Scott AFB FMA for those
   containing the HQ AMC fund cite). Use this copy to post obligations in the accounting
   system.
   8.19.3. Delete Table referenced below paragraph 8.19.3.
   8.19.4. See Chapter 19, paragraph 19.6 of this publication for funding of flying clothing of
   members who go TDY incident to formal retraining with a follow-on PCS assignment.
8.20. HQ AMC Inspector General (IG) Oversight Visits (EORIs, ERIs, NSIs, OPLAN 8044
Inspections, and UCIs). NOTE: The term ―inspected unit‖ refers to units receiving the
inspection.
   8.20.1. HQ AMC IG Team Support.
   8.20.2. TDY. HQ AMC/IG funds for TDY of its personnel accomplishing AMC oversight
   visits. It also funds per diem and transportation costs of those personnel from AMC and
   AMC-gained units who augment the AMC/IG as inspectors. AMC/IG does not fund observer
   personnel to oversight visits.
   8.20.3. Rental of Vehicles. AMC/IG will notify the inspected unit of its home station vehicle
   requirements, if necessary. AMC active duty units (host/tenant) are responsible for
   supporting and funding this requirement out of in-house government assets or commercial
   rentals. For inspected Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command unit-equipped
   locations and all Forward Operating Base (FOB) locations, including ANG Combat
   Readiness Training Centers, HQAMC/IG will provide agency vehicle requirements through
   the Transportation Commander with jurisdiction over the host installation. It is up to the
   cognizant Transportation Commander to determine how best to meet the requirement, either
   through existing government vehicles, fleet augmentation, or by rental vehicles. In
   accordance with AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, chapter 5, paragraph 5.10.1.,
   Transportation commanders may rent or lease vehicles to meet peak workloads. If

   commercial rental vehicles are required, HQ AMC/IG will use an AF Form 9, AF Form 616,
   or DD Form 448, as applicable.
   8.20.4. Lodging. AMC/IG will notify inspected unit of home station lodging requirements, if
   necessary. AMC/IG will use government lodging to the maximum extent possible. For
   commercial contract lodging requirements, use an AF Form 9, AF Form 616, or DD Form
   448 as applicable. AMC/IG may also deal directly with commercial lodging establishments
   using a CBA in lieu of the AF Form 9 or 616. AMC/IG will deal bilaterally with appropriate
   agencies at FOB locations.
   8.20.5. Inspected Unit (AMC or AMC-Gained) Responsibilities.
       8.20.5.1. TDY. The inspected unit is responsible to fund per diem and transportation of
       inspected unit personnel and any manning assistance or augmentation from AMC units or
       other MAJCOM units. This includes all unit functional areas as well as generic assistance
       (e.g., TALCE, MST, aerial port, etc.) that a unit may require during their EORI scenario.
       8.20.5.2. Rental of Vehicles. The inspected unit is responsible for funding (if required)
       both its home station and deployed location vehicle requirements. Ensure maximum use
       of host government vehicle assets prior to rental of commercial vehicles.
       8.20.5.3. Lodging. The inspected unit is responsible for funding (if required) both its
       home station and deployed location lodging support. Ensure maximum use of
       government lodging facilities.
       8.20.5.4. Miscellaneous Costs. During EORI scenarios at home station or at deployed
       locations, the inspected unit is responsible for all contract commercial and government
       purchases they incur during the course of the inspection scenario. These costs include,
       but are not limited to subsistence, ground fuel, water, ice, portable toilets, trash removal,
       and dining hall support.
   8.20.6. BTOs. AMC/IG is authorized to use BTOs for team travel until the end of each fiscal
   year. AMC/IG will use individual travel orders for five or fewer members after 15 September
   of each fiscal year. See the note in paragraph 8.4.8 above for the discontinuance of BTOs
   when the DTS is fielded and implemented.
8.21. In-Place Consecutive Overseas Tour (IPCOT). Air Force IPCOT is funded from the
MILPERS (3500) appropriation. See AFMAN 65-604, under Military Personnel, Air Force
(Fund Code 32), to construct the appropriate MILPERS fund cites, including the necessary
projects or subprojects, to charge the travel costs of the military member and their command
sponsored family member‘s round trip travel to the CONUS.
8.22. Technical Order Development TDY. Charge TDY costs for technical order
development to the procurement appropriation (57*3010) when the purchase of data occurs
during the production of the aircraft (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapters 4 and 14).
8.23. Dependent Student Travel. Charge the travel costs of dependent students performing
their annual trip from schools in the United States to and from overseas areas to the overseas
theater command (HQ PACAF or HQ USAFE) for O&M personnel. Charge the travel costs for
dependents of TWCF-assigned personnel to the TWCF unit of assignment. EEIC 409 (or
authorized 2-digit shred) applies.
8.24. Patient and Non-Medical Attendant Travel.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         69


   8.24.1. Charge TDY costs, including local travel (when government transportation is not
   available), of Air Force active duty members to receive medical care and their non-medical
   attendants to funds available to operate the referring MTF (AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter
   10, paragraph 10.25.2.). AFI 41-101, Obtaining Civilian Medical and Dental Care, contains
   additional guidance relating to patient and non-medical attendant travel.
   8.24.2. TDY funding for movement of Army, Navy, and Marine active duty members is the
   responsibility of the member‘s unit unless the following conditions apply: (1) The movement
   is for Army, Navy, Marine active duty members, their dependents, and medical and non-
   medical attendants, when assigned to Air Force installations or locations that do not have a
   fixed MTF or (2) movement is for an active duty member to a civilian (non-defense) hospital
   when the service headquarters does not authorize the required medical treatment at the
   installation MTF or the required medical treatment is outside the capabilities of the referring
   MTF. HQ USAF/SGHC annually provides, by message, the TDY fund cites for these
   requirements. Dependent patient and non-medical attendant associated travel and per diem
   expenses incurred by dependents residing with their Air Force active duty sponsor in an
   overseas location only is the responsibility of the referring medical facility or to the Air
   Force CMA fund cite. Charge TDY costs to the referring medical facility for an active duty
   member to serve as a non-medical attendant to a dependent when medically evacuating the
   dependent in CONUS from one medical facility to another medical facility and for required
   medical attention not available locally (JFTR, part Q, paragraph U7550.5.). The proper
   medical authority approves all non-medical attendant travel.
8.25. Transportation of Family Members of Very Seriously Ill/Injured (VSI) or Seriously
Ill/ Injured (SI) Active Duty Service Members or Active Duty Reserve
Allowance. Reference AFI 41-114, Military Health Services System (MHSS) Matrix, table 30.,
which provides guidance for travel of next of kin. Do not charge Defense Health Program (DHP)
funds for this program.
8.26. Attendance of Non-Federal Government Employees at Awards Ceremonies or
Dinners. Per 31 U.S.C., Section 1345, you may use APF to fund TDY costs of non-federal
government employees to attend an awards ceremony or dinner for which they are the recipient
of an award, if specific legislation exists that expressly allows for the expenditure. Additionally,
under the ―Purpose Law‖ if there is specific statutory authority to give awards to non-federal
government employees and that authority allows for the ―necessary‖ expense to honor award
recipients, TDY and related costs are payable from APF for the employee and spouse. See
CompGen Decision B-235163.11 (13 February 96) for additional details. Funding is the
responsibility of the organization hosting the awards ceremony or dinner.
8.27. Evacuation Expenses for Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) and Army and Air Force
Exchange (AAFES) Employees in Contingency and Emergency Situations. When the wing
commander orders an emergency evacuation, APF is authorized for evacuation travel/per diem
costs of NAF/AAFES-funded employees in the same manner as APF-funded employees.
Justification for this is based upon DoDI 1400.32, DoD Civilian Work Force Contingency and
Emergency Planning Guidelines and Procedures, in that both APF and NAF/AAFES employees
are encompassed in its definition of ―DoD civilian work force‖ for contingency and emergency
procedures.

8.28. MPA Man-day (Volunteer Activation) TDY Funding Under Title 10 U.S.C., Section
12301(d). See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.2.1.1 (et seq.) on TDY funding
guidance for ANG/AFRC/IMA personnel activated on MPA Man-days to fulfill AMC active
duty requirements.
8.29. Mobilization (Non-Volunteer Activation) TDY Funding Under Title 10 U. S.C.,
Section 12302. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.2.1.2. (et seq.) on TDY
funding guidance for ANF/AFRC/IMA personnel who are mobilized to fulfill AMC active duty
requirements.
8.30. Funding Medical Deployments. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraphs 10.26.2
and 10.26.8 provide guidance on funding for medical deployments pertaining to tactical medical
facilities operated separately from hospitals and medical care provided to members at local
indigenous medical facilities during contingencies at deployed locations that do not have fixed
medical treatment facilities. Charge these costs to O&M 3400 funds and not to DHP (Fund Code
2X) funds. This includes the cost of supplies used during deployment and resupply upon return
as well as TDY costs of deployed medical personnel, special uniform requirements (including
body armor for combat aeromedical teams) and any required A/B mobility bags. Additionally,
charge TDY costs for locally assigned critical care teams that are responsible for processing
wartime casualty patients airlifted from overseas locations to CONUS processing facilities
outside of the local MTF to O&M 3400 funds.
8.31. Funding TDY Costs of Witnesses Required to Attend Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO)/Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) Hearings.
   8.31.1. For Air Force military and civilian employees, TDY funding is the responsibility of
   their current unit of assignment, regardless if they are still at the location where the
   EEO/MSPB infraction occurred or they have moved on to another Air Force installation. See
   AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.17.2.3.
   8.31.2. For Federal civilian employees assigned to another DoD/non-DoD agency (e.g.,
   Army, Navy, DFAS, DISA, FBI, etc.), the Air Force installation against which the complaint
   is brought funds their TDY costs. This may be designated to the specific organization on the
   installation where the complaint arose. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP, paragraph
   10.17.2.3.2.
   8.31.3. The Air Force is not responsible to fund the travel costs of the complainant's private
   attorney. However, the Air Force pays for travel costs of private witnesses (i.e., those
   approved witnesses who are recently retired from the Air Force, who resigned from the
   government to take employment from a private company, or other private expert witnesses)
   for EEO/MSPB hearings, regardless if they are testifying on behalf of the complainant or the
   Air Force. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP, paragraph 10.17.2.3.3.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       71

                                     TRANSPORTATION

9.1. General Information. Charge the movement of retrograde cargo offloaded at incorrect
CONUS APOD to end destination to local TWCF funds. Additionally, local TWCF funds pay
the costs to forward lost or misrouted passenger baggage and diverting or forwarding passengers
and cargo to or from alternate on-load and off-load points, due of unforeseen mission changes
directed by the TACC. Utilize available positioning TWCF aircraft, opportune airlift, etc., to the
maximum extent possible to move these shipments, especially within the CONUS.
   9.1.1. Excess Baggage. See Chapter 8, paragraph 8.3.4 of this publication.
   9.1.2. Charge commercial packing and drayage into storage, when caused by base quarters
   occupancy, to EEIC 46200.
   9.1.3. Counsel PCS members involved in the shipment or storage of household goods
   (HHG) to discard all items that have outlived or should outlive their usefulness.
   9.1.4. Review transportation operations for shipping trends. For repetitive shipments to a
   particular destination, ensure utilization of the most economical shipping methods.
   9.1.5. Establish procedures to ensure that only those authorized HHG items that are over and
   above the storage space capability provided in government quarters occupy commercial non-
   temporary storage facilities (see AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management, chapter 5,
   paragraph 5.6.).
9.2. Channel Transportation. All second destination transportation of Air Force cargo via the
TWCF carriers within the established AMC channel is the responsibility of HQ AFMC. This
includes cargo shipment from and between CONUS aerial ports and overseas aerial ports,
irrespective of the identity of the activity initiating the movement. Overwater transportation via
the Military Sealift Command is also the responsibility of HQ AFMC. All second destination
cargo transportation via the TWCF outside the channel traffic (Special Assignment Airlift) is the
financial responsibility of the requesting command.
9.3. Local Drayage. In accordance with AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management, paragraph
1.5.21, the Housing Flight Chief is responsible for budgeting, controlling, and authorizing
expenditures for local drayage and storage of HHG for family housing and unaccompanied
housing. Budgeting and funding is an O&M (3400) responsibility. Funding for these costs is
provided in PE 48542F and applied against RC/CC XX9050. These funds are for the exclusive
use of local drayage and non-temporary storage of HHG, as authorized by the JFTR.
9.4. First Destination Transportation (FDT) Funding. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10,
paragraph 10.38., provides guidance for charging the O&M, RDT&E, or procurement
appropriation that financed the acquisition item for free-on-board (FOB)-Origin or FOB-
Destination charges. In cases involving the purchase of items delivered on a FOB-Destination
basis, include the transportation cost as part of the purchase price. For FOB-Origin basis, the
MAJCOM financing the procurement of the asset with its O&M funds must also fund the first
destination transportation with the same O&M type funds. TWCF units are responsible for
funding any FDT requirements outside of the normal supply and transportation channels, but
limited only to operational emergencies.

9.5. (DELETED)
9.6. Other TWCF Transportation Costs.
   9.6.1. PCS Moves of TWCF Civilian Personnel. Charge the overwater transportation costs
   of HHG to the TWCF (gaining organization pays) if the person is gained by a TWCF
   organization and is filling a TWCF PE authorization, or if a TWCF PE coded employee
   returns to the United States (losing organization pays) for retirement or separation.
   9.6.2. Overbooking of TWCF Passengers. The TWCF also pays for transportation from an
   AMC APOE to a commercial gateway in cases where an individual receives a port call to the
   APOE and an overbooking occurs on the AMC scheduled flight.
   9.6.3. Lost or Misrouted Baggage. Costs to forward lost or misrouted passenger baggage on
   TWCF owned or controlled aircraft are a TWCF responsibility (AMCI 24-101, Volume 15,
   Military Airlift Baggage Service, paragraph 12.4.2.). Also included are costs to divert or
   forward passengers and cargo to or from alternate on-load and off-load points due to
   unforeseen mission changes.
   9.6.4. TWCF Equipment. Charge the shipping costs of TWCF equipment and material
   delivered outside of normal supply and transportation channels to local TWCF funds. These
   cases should be limited to operational emergencies only.
   9.6.5. CONUS Transportation of Intertheater Cargo Shipments. The TWCF is responsible
   for surface transportation costs to forward intertheater cargo shipments off-loaded at a TWCF
   aerial port, destined for further shipment to another theater. An example would be a shipment
   that originates in the airlift transportation system at a PACAF location, with a final
   destination at a USAFE location, off-loaded at Travis AFB awaiting further transportation to
   an East Coast APOE for onward shipment in the airlift transportation system to the USAFE
   location.
   9.6.6. Please refer to AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.1.7.8. for policy regarding
   TWCF commercial transportation funding responsibilities.
9.7. Transportation of Aircraft Parts from ANG/AFRC Bases to MRTs Supporting NMC
Aircraft Flying AMC Missions. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.2.13.5.
(et seq.) for applicable funding policy.
9.8. General Reusable Container Program. See AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of
Air Force Cargo, chapter 9, paragraph 9.10.1.3.3. for reimbursement of costs specific to the
replacement of reusable containers doe to wear and tear and reusable containers that are lost,
destroyed, or discarded.

                                 LEASES AND RENTALS

10.1. Reprographics Equipment. In accordance with DoDD 5330.3, Defense Automated
Printing Service (DAPS), the Chief of Information Management monitors all copy producing
reprographics equipment. The base IM monitors the usage of each copier, computer forms
printer, microfilm equipment for micrographics production facilities, and leased duplicating or
printing equipment. Charge all copiers used in organizations funded by O&M or TWCF to EEIC
50301 for O&M and the CC of the applicable TWCF organization.
   10.1.1. Charge costs to lease copiers in accordance with each base's Copy Service Plan to
   EEIC 50301. Charge MTF copiers under the Copy Service Plan to the appropriate MTF
   RC/CC using EEIC 50301.
   10.1.2. Use EEIC 47390 to record costs for all other leased copier equipment (exclusive of
   data automation computer forms, printers, and equipment operated in duplicating centers or
   facilities), MSIR controlled copiers, printers, and other IPE-related equipment, and leased
   reprographics equipment located exclusively in duplicating centers or facilities or operated
   by duplicating and printing personnel.
10.2. Vehicles. See AFI 24-301 for vehicle lease procedures. NOTE: The cost of leasing
ambulances and ambulance buses for the MTF is charged to O&M 3400 funds, not DHP (FC
2X) funds, regardless of the source of supply.
10.3. Other Leased Equipment. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.60.
Keep in mind, the scoring rules in OMB Circular A-11, Appendix B apply for long term leases.

                                          UTILITIES

11.1. General Information. The utility program comprises a large share of operating funds at
all AMC bases. An intensified conservation program should remain within funding availability.
The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) determines utility rate charges to tenants using guidelines
established in AFI 32-1061, Providing Utilities to US Air Force Installations, chapter 3.
   11.1.1. Review utility sales rates monthly to ensure they include the basic cost indicated on
   the current month's utility bill, plus applicable additives. The BCE reviews utility sales
   agreements annually in accordance with AFI 32-1061. Review and consider utility
   consumption for the same period the previous year and consumption in the prior month when
   preparing current month utility estimates.
   11.1.2. Utilization of the five-digit (480XX) EEIC shred is mandatory for both the program
   and actual expenses for purchased utilities. (2-digit shreds to EEIC 596 should be used to
   record base-produced utility charges for medical facilities.)
   11.1.3. For utilities payments made to contractors for energy savings realized through
   Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) or Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC),
   use the 2-digit EEIC shred listed under each separate 5-digit utilities EEIC. EXAMPLE: Use
   EEIC 48011 to record payment associated with the energy savings realized due to an ESPC
   for water.
11.2. Utilities Reimbursements for TWCF-Assigned Facilities. The TWCF reimburses O&M
for utilities (see AFI 32-1061) consumed in TWCF designated facilities. AMCI 65-602, Table
6.1 lists those facility category codes that qualify for TWCF funding at AMC locations that
engage in TWCF activities. Install utility meters according to the provisions of AFI 32-1061,
chapter 3, paragraph 3.6. Utilities include purchased or base produced gas, electricity, water,
heat, and sewage disposal. IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 7.17., the TWCF activity
reimburses the providing activity for utility services as well as other "contractual" services. The
word "contractual" describes the arrangement for services between the TWCF and providing
authority. The definition does not apply to the method the providing activity uses to
perform/provide the service (i.e., in service or by commercial contract).
   11.2.1. Medical activities budget, direct cite or reimburse for all utilities whether
   commercially supplied or base produced. Use the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 480 to
   record commercially supplied utilities.
   11.2.2. Pay particular attention to recording purchased utility reimbursements to the
   appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 480 cited on the payment of the actual utility bill. For base
   produced utilities, collect reimbursements to the EEIC that bore the original cost of
   production (i.e., 1XX, 60X, 64X). Do not use EEICs 513 and 599 for O&M 3400
   transactions. Use the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 513 for the MFH appropriation.
       11.2.2.1. NOTE: The cost of cable TV is not a utilities expense. Record these costs to
       EEIC 44910. Do not use EEIC 480 to record obligations/expenses for cable TV.
   11.2.3. We recommend that budget, functional area chiefs (users), and CE develop and
   maintain a complete list of reimbursable facilities which pay for their own utility costs.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     75


  Ensure IWIMS records are consistent with this list. Review the list and reconcile with
  IWIMS records at least once per year, preferably just prior to O&M and TWCF budget
  submissions. Pay particular attention to utility reimbursements from NAF activities.
  11.2.4. Do not apply TWCF funds for utilities costs of facilities with category codes other
  than those specifically provided for in Table 6.1. of AMCI 65-602. If a base/organization
  feels additional category codes should be authorized for TWCF funding responsibility at
  TWCF-funded locations, they can request a waiver/addition to the current list from HQ
  AMC/FMA, through HQ AMC/A7P. Ensure such a request includes a thorough explanation
  of the need and justification for the change. Keep in mind that scarce O&M funding is not
  sufficient justification to authorize TWCF funding of CE-related costs for additional facility
  category codes. NOTE: For facilities that share both TWCF and O&M organizations, the
  utilities cost will be split between TWCF and O&M 3400 funds, based on a percentage of
  square feet occupied or the number of TWCF/O&M personnel, whichever is more
  appropriate (see AMCI 65-602, paragraphs 6.3.1.6.6.4. and 6.3.2.2.5.).

      COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS

12.1. General Information. A C4 system is a combination of facilities, computer equipment,
software, communications equipment, transmission media, procedures, people, and other
resources used for the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement,
control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. This
does not include embedded communications or computer systems. These systems and allied
support expenses continue to be closely monitored, evaluated, and scrutinized. Particular
management emphasis is necessary in this area since continuing efforts toward reductions and
conservation in other areas inevitably affect communications requirements. In many instances,
the savings achieved in other areas are partially offset by increased communications costs. Table
12.1 below provides a review of specific communications programs.

Service to SVS (NAF)       When supporting the command management functions of the
Activities                 SVS activities, i.e., statistical data gathering and reporting and
                           for communications with other DoD and government
                           agencies, each SVS Category A and B facility manager will
                           receive full communications support (i.e., class of phone,
                           number of lines, DSN access, etc.) on a non-reimbursable
                           basis with the approval by the local CSRB or communications
                           commander. SVS Category C activities authorized on a non-
                           reimbursable basis, one Class C line per facility. Provide
                           additional lines on a reimbursable basis.
Leased Communications      Give increased visibility to costs associated with leased
                           communications, focusing on mission impact and cost
                           effectiveness.
12.2. Telephone/Cable TV Reconnection Charges. Telephone/cable TV reconnection charges
incurred by unaccompanied personnel who occupy dormitories/bachelor quarters, during an
official directed move from or between dormitories are reimbursable, provided the move does
not involve a PCS. AFI 33-111 provides specific guidance on reimbursement procedures for the
costs incurred in reconnecting a telephone because of a directed PCS move. Charge the O&M
appropriation for relocation in dormitories or bachelor quarters. Military Family Housing (MFH)
occupants are not authorized reimbursement for these charges because they are authorized a
partial dislocation allowance (PDLA) when the government directs a non-PCS move.
12.3. Communications Services for Senior Officer Base Housing. AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
chapter 4, paragraph 4.24.5., provides the following funding guidance:
   12.3.1. AFI 33-111 authorizes official telephone service in the form of direct lines to the
   base switchboard or Class C phone lines in personal quarters, only for individuals in
   ―positions requiring immediate communications response for command and control.‖ Do not
   authorize Class A telephone service that provides local off-base telephone service. However,
   you may fund for telephone service limited to on-base and long distance communication,
   given a mission essential need. The activity providing the service should keep written
   authorization for these communication services on file. Except for alternate worksites
   covered in 31 U.S.C., Section 1348 (as amended by Public Law 104-52, Title IV, Section
   620, 109, Stat. 501), do not authorize appropriated funds to provide telephone service in
   personal quarters where there is no clearly established requirement for immediate command
   and control access.
   12.3.2. Do not provide communications access solely on the basis of grade. Individuals
   authorized official telephone service in their private (on-base) residence must have a
   functional need for immediate command and control access. Services provided are for
   official use only.
   12.3.3. You may use appropriated funds to provide LAN services to private (on-base)
   residences when there is a mission need for these services. Use these LAN services in private
   (on-base) residences only for official business. However, charge any fiber cable installation
   costs to the Military Family Housing (MFH) O&M appropriation in accordance with AFI 65-
 78                                                             AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.25.3. Use the appropriate budget project provided in
   chapter 21 of AFI 65-601, Volume 1.
12.4. Information Processing Equipment (IPE). General purpose IPE includes computer and
word processing resources acquired and managed in accordance with the 33-series Air Force
instructions. DoD-FMR 7000.14, Volume 2A, Budget Information and Presentation, chapter 1,
paragraph 010211 and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, section 4B., describes budgeting and
funding policies for IPE (to include Information Technology and Automated Information
Systems), related software, and maintenance.
12.5. The Small Computer Support Office. The small computer technical center, located in
the base communications squadron, may have excess software and hardware on-hand or may be
able to act as a clearing house to redistribute excess software and hardware.
12.6. Definition of a Small Computer. The term small computer is generic and refers to a
specific class of equipment to include associated peripherals and software. It has the capacity to
execute various software programs and usually consists of at least a keyboard, disk drive, visual
display device, printer, and central processing unit with random access and read-only memory.
Commercial personal computers, dedicated text processors (memory typewriters and related
equipment previously known as word processing equipment), intelligent workstations used for
translation processing on multi-user computers, intelligent typewriters, and portable computers
are all examples of small computers.
12.7. Funding Criteria. Functional users must budget and fund for standard and nonstandard
small computer assets including hardware, software, maintenance, and supplies. Exceptions:
   12.7.1. A small computer that is a nonstandard piece of equipment that is connected and
   critical to the operation of a HQ AMC/A6 centrally funded and acquired system. HQ
   AMC/A6 centrally budgets and funds the acquisition and recurring maintenance costs for
   these systems.
   12.7.2. User-funded Requirements Documents. When a functional user has a HQ AMC/A6
   approved but unfunded requirements document pertaining to HQ AMC, the user may elect to
   provide unit funds to HQ AMC/A6.
   12.7.3. (DELETED)
12.8. Local Area Network (LAN) Funding Definition. In accordance with AFI 65-601,
Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.3.1., funding for a LAN system or subsystem, the backbone
and ancillary equipment that gives users access to the LAN, is determined as follows:
   12.8.1. You must subdivide the basic LAN requirement to its lowest system form, e.g., base-
   wide organizational (wing, squadron, division, branch, etc.) or functional community
   (logistics, maintenance, civil engineering, etc.). This includes any equipment and software
   integral to the operation of the LAN system, to include file servers, network software,
   routers, and other LAN components, (e.g., line drivers, multiplexers, tape backup units,
   interconnecting cable, etc.), and is subject to the application of the expense/investment dollar
   threshold of $250,000 (O&M/3080 and TWCF Operating/Capital). Ensure you include the
   contract costs associated with the initial acquisition of a new LAN system (e.g., quality
   assurance, production engineering, equipment assembly, and installation) in the aggregate
   cost of all equipment items acquired to make the LAN system operate.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                      79


   12.8.2. For ancillary equipment such as personal computers, printers, etc., where each user's
   primary purpose is to operate independently from the LAN, apply the expense and
   investment criteria to each individual user. For example, if you are adding 10 personal
   computers and a printer to the LAN to satisfy 10 new users, and the cost of each PC and the
   printer is less than $250,000 (expense/investment – O&M/3080 or TWCF
   Operating/Capital), use O&M or TWCF Operating funds for the purchase of the additional
   PCs. However, if the aggregate cost of the multiple purchases toward a particular
   requirement exceeds $250,000 over a short period of time (12 months), you may have an
   improper project splitting violation, as discussed in the following paragraph.
   12.8.3. You should cost each upgrade or modification of the LAN itself, to include file
   servers, network software, and other LAN components separately from the original purchase;
   however, the users are reminded not to fragment upgrades or modifications to an existing
   system to get around the dollar threshold. As a general rule, consider any upgrades or
   modifications to a LAN obligated within any 12-month period a part of the same original
   requirement and the total of those costs are subject to the expense and investment criteria.
   The Communications-Computer System Requirements Board needs to forecast all upgrades
   or modifications to each LAN for each fiscal year to ensure proper obligations. Justify and
   fully document exceptions to this rule, with the documentation accompanying the CSRD (AF
   Form 3215, IT/NSS Requirements Document) through its review cycle.
   12.8.4. Purchase of repair parts or components are subject to the expense and investment
   criteria on a ―cost per component‖ basis. Repair parts or components and spares should be
   functionally equivalent to the replaced unit of the failed component. Consider all parts
   purchased to replace components that are functioning but no longer logistically supportable
   as a modification.
   12.8.5. For computer and LAN systems purchased with TWCF Capital funds, documentation
   requirements also include an EA. Additionally, any computer or LAN systems purchased
   with 3080 funds $1,000,000 or greater also require an EA.
12.9. Application Software.
   12.9.1. The application of the expense and investment threshold to application software,
   with limited data rights or licensed to the Air Force does not apply to purchases of software
   that exceeds $250,000 (O&M/3080 or TWCF Operating/Capital) (number of copies times the
   unit price). The only exception would be if a single copy of a particular commercial software
   package costs $250,000 or more.
   12.9.2. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.3.3., establish management
   controls to ensure the procurement of sufficient application software to allow installation of
   stand-alone operation of each PC, should the network fail for an extended period of time.
   Install and use only the authorized number of copies of the application software throughout
   the network, whether in a networked mode (launched from a file server) or from the
   individual PC hard drives. Where the application software is loaded or stored, does not
   determine the funding source for the PC, only whether the PC can operate independently or is
   integral to the LAN operation.
      12.9.2.1. If the software being purchased is exclusively for the stand-alone PCs, then
      O&M 3400 or TWCF Operating funds apply.
 80                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


       12.9.2.2. If the software being purchased cannot run independently on each PC to
       effectively use the software, you need to consider the aggregate cost of the systems
       upgrade (including the application software) and apply the expense and investment
       threshold accordingly.
   12.9.3. The overriding rule is that stand-alone PC operation integrity determines the decision
   process to purchase, upgrade, or modify PCs using O&M 3400 or TWCF Operating funds.
   As a general practice we suggest that you prepare separate requirements documents for items
   integral to LAN operations and those items that are not integral to LAN operations. As long
   as you maintain the independent operational capability of the PC, the decision to shift
   application software resident on the PC to a network mode after initial procurement is a
   totally separate issue and is not germane when determining the appropriate funding source.
   12.9.4. Loading the application software concurrently on the file server (to be downloaded)
   and on the PC‘s hard drive (as backup) typically causes operational problems with
   initialization files, so switching back and forth on a routine basis is not recommended.
   12.9.5. Retain applications software disks at a centralized location in each work area for
   control and accountability, or each LAN manager could produce a site or concurrent license
   (right to copy), allowing multiple implementations from a single set of master disks. This
   ensures the capability for stand-alone PC operation in the event of a LAN failure.
12.10. Software Development Contracts.
   12.10.1. When an acquiring activity pays a contractor for software development services, the
   amount is not subject to the investment threshold. O&M 3400 funds are applicable. See AFI
   65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.4.3.1.
   12.10.2. TWCF requirements are the exception to this Air Force policy. Apply the expense
   and investment threshold to any software development $250,000 or greater. Budget and fund
   with TWCF Capital, as directed by USTRANSCOM. See AMCI 65-602, chapter 8,
   paragraph 8.4.3.
12.11. Software Purchased With Unlimited Data Rights. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter
4, paragraph 4.4.3.1.2., any acquired software not purchased through a development or services
contract for which the Air Force has unlimited data rights (i.e., the Air Force actually owns the
software and is free to use, distribute, duplicate, and dispose of without restriction from its
publisher or developer) is not subject to the expense and investment threshold. O&M 3400 or
TWCF Operating funds apply, presuming that each software copy is less that $250,000.
12.12. Tracking ADPE/IPE Related Expenses. Use the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 568
(not the 3-digit EEIC 568) to track base level O&M and TWCF cost for maintenance of
ADPE/IPE equipment. Use the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 637 (not the 3-digit EEIC 637)
to identify purchases for non-SMAG ADPE/IPE expense hardware component and unmodified
off-the-shelf software.
12.13. Funding for Site Surveys Required to Field ADP Systems that Meet or Exceed the
Expense/ Investment or TWCF Operating/Capital Thresholds. If site surveys are to be
performed by contract and it is included in the total contract cost, to include delivery and
installation of the system, use 3080/ TWCF Capital, as appropriate, to fund the entire contract
amount under the ―total system cost‖ concept provided it exceeds the appropriate threshold. If in-
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                      81


house military or civilian employees perform the site surveys, use unit funds to pay the required
TDY costs, not investment funds.
12.14. Cellular Telephone (CT) Service. AFI 33-111, paragraph 26.4., states: ―Using
organizations are responsible for payment of their unit CT bills, using unit funds, where
contractually applicable.‖ Use these services only when they are the most cost-effective way to
provide the necessary communications. The unit GPC is authorized for payment of CT
equipment and services. The using organization must receive approval from the Communications
Squadron Officer prior to purchasing CT equipment and services. Follow procedures in AFI 33-
106 for inventory control and establishment for CT services.
12.15. Morale Calls. DoDD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, chapter 2, paragraph 2-301.,
permits morale calls by deployed military and other DoD personnel who are deployed for
extended periods away from home on official DoD business in the interest of morale and
welfare. Theater commander approval is required. Consult the reference above for other limiting
factors concerning approved morale calls. NOTE: Morale calls are not reimbursable on travel
vouchers. See Chapter 8, paragraph 8.3.3 of this publication concerning authorized
communications costs that are reimbursable while TDY.
12.16. Telephone Calling Cards. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, for funding guidance
on purchasing telephone calling cards, to include proper procedures for approval prior to
purchase. The Defense Information and Systems Agency (DISA) is the only approved source to
procure telephone calling cards.
12.17. Operating Costs of AMC/A6 Program Offices that Manage TWCF-Funded
Programs. TWCF funds are not authorized to pay for TDY, office supplies, computer
equipment, and other day-to-day operating costs of HQ AMC/A6 program offices that manage
TWCF centrally managed information systems programs (e.g., ASIFICS, GATES, etc.). Funding
for these requirements is the responsibility of day-to-day operating funds of the assigned
organization and not the programs they manage. HQ AMC/A6 program offices are not TWCF-
assigned organizations that qualify for TWCF funding (see AMCI 65-602, paragraph 2.4.6.1.1.,
for TWCF-related organizations/facilities.
 82                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004

                            PRINTING AND REPRODUCTION

13.1. General Information. HQ AMC/FMA no longer distributes O&M 3400 funds for copier
contracts strictly in a particular PE. Instead, these funds are distributed to the wings in the
appropriate PE of execution.
   13.1.1. Fund the printing of base telephone directories in EEIC 50100.
13.2. Personalized Stationery, Calling and Greeting Cards. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter
4, paragraph 4.35., prohibits using APF for printing names of officers or other officials on
stationery, memorandums, or notes. Likewise, the printing of calling or greeting cards is a
personal expense. There are limited exceptions in which the purchase of commercially printed
(including DAPS) business cards is authorized, e.g., for military and civilian professional
recruiters (AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.36.). NOTE: The prohibition on APF
funding for personal stationery, etc., also applies to audio/video tapes when used for personal
reasons.
   13.2.1. The Air Force Recruiting Service approves all orders for professional military
   recruiter business cards. HQ AETC/IMR obtains the cards from the Government Printing
   Office (GPO).
   13.2.2. HQ USAF/IMR is responsible for funding business cards for the Air Force Academy
   Liaison Officers.
   13.2.3. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.36.1., you may print business
   cards, using existing software and agency-purchased card stock or purchase them from the
   Lighthouse for the Blind (a Javits-Wagner-O‘Day participating non-profit agency) if the cost
   is equivalent or cheaper than producing them on the office computer, for use in connection
   with official activities when the exchange of cards would facilitate mission-related business
   communications. This does not include the extension of social or business courtesies. Air
   Force policy still applies in paragraphs 13.2.1 and 13.2.2 above, with regard to
   commercially printed business cards, including DAPS. NOTE: The purchase of business
   cards from the Lighthouse for the Blind must be accomplished through DAPS. Do not use
   APF or TWCF funds to procure commercially printed business cards for personal or mission-
   related business communications.
13.3. Printing of Invitations:
   13.3.1. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.27., the use of APF to procure
   commercially-printed (including DAPS) invitations and programs to certain traditional
   ceremonies is authorized but limited to groundbreaking and dedication ceremonies for new
   facilities, Armed Forces change of command ceremonies, certain graduation ceremonies, and
   wreath-laying ceremonies in celebration of national patriotic observances (e.g., Memorial
   Day, Independence Day, September 11th, POW/MIA Recognition Day, and specific
   locations that have singularly historical significance (December 7th at Hickam AFB HI)). 56
   CompGen 81 (1976) and CompGen Decision B-211700, 16 Mach 84 have determined these
   types of invitations are not personal in nature. Do not charge the cost of commercially printed
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     83


   (including DAPS) invitations or programs for individual retirement or award ceremonies to
   unit O&M or TWCF funds.
   13.3.2. Paragraph 13.2.3 above is also applicable to the printing of invitations and
   programs for any official military or civilian retirement and promotion ceremony (see AFI
   65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.54.3.) or award ceremonies, using existing computer
   software and agency-purchased paper stock.
   13.3.3. There may be other similar instances that authorize unit funds to print invitations.
   However, the purpose or ―mission‖ of the event for the required invitation or program is the
   basis of the ceremony and not the individual. The precise scope of the ―traditional ceremony‖
   concept has never been fully defined in appropriation law. If you have any questions
   concerning the appropriate use of unit funds for a particular invitation requirement, please
   request a legal opinion from your local JAG prior to funding authorization.
13.4. Name Tags Worn by Civilian Employees. Comptroller General decision (69 Comp Gen
82 (1989)) declared name tags to be worn on the person are not the same as business cards and
may be provided from unit funds. Name tags are more closely analogous to government
identification cards, and are not a personal expense.
 84                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004

SUSTAINMENT, RESTORATION, AND MODERNIZATION BY CONTRACT (SRMC)

14.1. General Information. Initial distribution of O&M, TWCF, and MFH funds excludes
SRMC (EEIC 52XXX and A-E (EEIC 532XX) funding). HQ AMC/FMA, at the discretion of
HQ AMC/A7R, will issue all SRMC and A-E funding (obligation or expense authority) on a
project specific basis, as follows:
14.2. SRMC Change Orders. Funding procedures for SRMC change orders vary based on the
funds source. HQ AMC/A7R/FMA issues annual guidance outlining the applicable procedures.
14.3. Emergency Facility and Storm Damage Funding. Refer to the latest AMC/FM Initial
Distribution General Guidance for emergency conditions resulting from storm damage. Current
guidance and template on natural disaster reporting is available on the AMC/FM web page under
FMAO at . Following these outlined procedures will expedite reimbursement of costs.
14.4. TWCF Facilities.
   14.4.1. SRMC of TWCF-assigned facilities, within budgetary limitations, are chargeable to
   the TWCF whether performed by contract or by the BCE. You should determine all
   reimbursement for work performed by the BCE on actual direct costs of civilian labor and
   materials used. Facilities that qualify for TWCF funding primarily include TWCF aerial
   ports, TWCF operation centers, maintenance facilities, squadron operation facilities, aircrew
   alert facilities (Charleston AFB only), waste disposal and treatment facilities associated with
   wash racks dedicated exclusively to TWCF-assigned aircraft, and apron parking and lighting,
   staging and storage yards, fuel hydrants, and blast deflectors, also dedicated exclusively for
   TWCF-assigned aircraft. See AMCI 65-602, table 6.1., for a complete list of TWCF-eligible
   facility category codes.
   14.4.2. TWCF In-House Reimbursements. See AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph
   6.3.1.6.1. (et seq.) for guidance on processing TWCF BCE facility maintenance
   reimbursements, including facilities that are not solely occupied by TWCF activities.
   14.4.3. Funding for Carpet Installation, Replacement or Repair in TWCF-Assigned
   Facilities. Follow guidance provided in AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.1.7.13.
14.5. AMC Tenant Funding Procedure. For MC projects designed and approved for contract
with a funded cost over $2,000 in support of an AMC O&M-funded unit on a non-AMC base,
the host BCE should submit a request for funds to HQ AMC/A7A. Request should identify the
Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN) of the tenant unit. Paragraph 14.1.1 procedures
above are applicable. A-E design services (except for TWCF projects) are support functions and
the host is responsible for budgeting and funding support functions common to all tenant
organizations to the extent the tenant is not self-supporting. The only exception to this general
rule is contract services for off-base tenant units when the host does not have the organic
capability to provide the support. A-E design services (in-house and contract) of off-base tenant
organization SRM projects are funded by the tenant (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, item #6B of
figure 7.1.).
14.6. Funding for Tenant Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Measures at Host AMC Bases.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                85


    14.6.1. HQ USAF/ILE memorandum dated 5 Feb 99 (Subject: Force Protection Measures-
    Class of Work) classifies all force protection facility requirements as restoration-repair
    projects, even if they are outside the footprint of the facility. Generally, the host is
    responsible for sustainment of all base facilities, including those occupied by tenants, due to
    sustainment being associated with the actual care of the facility. EXCEPTION: Force
    protection is classified as a restoration-repair project if the project involves a particular
    facility. A force protection project protecting multiple facilities is classified as restoration
    and modernization or MILCON (i.e., a base perimeter fence).
    14.6.2. The host is responsible to fund all force protection facility projects related to the
    protection of the general population of the base and the base facilities. Per AFI 32-1032,
    Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and Construction
    Projects, chapter 6, paragraph 6.5.3.3., the tenant is responsible for funding any force
    protection measures unique to the tenant‘s operations over and above what is provided to the
    general base population.
14.7. O&M/TWCF MC Limitation. The limitation for MC projects funded with O&M 3400
or TWCF Capital (BPAC 21X) funds is $750 thousand or less. (NOTE: Changed from $500
thousand in accordance with the FY02 Defense Authorization Act – P. L. 107-107, Title 28,
Section 2801(b)(2).) However, in accordance with AFI 32-1032, paragraph 5.1.2.1., AFI 65-601,
Volume 1, chapter 9, paragraph 9.10., and AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph
18.5.1.3., if the project is justified to correct a deficiency that is life, health, or safety threatening,
O&M 3400 or TWCF Capital, as appropriate, may fund the MC project up to and including $1.5
million. (NOTE: Changed from $1 million in accordance with the FY02 Defense Authorization
Act – P.L. 107-107, Title 28, Section 2801(b)(1).) Such projects require SAF/MII approval and
congressional notification prior to funding.
14.8. Unit O&M 3400 Funding of CE Facility Projects. As a general rule, O&M funding for
CE SRM facility projects is budgeted and executed in the various CE PECs to accomplish the
required work. The basis for that is the various organizations are funded to accomplish their
assigned missions and not for CE-related requirements. Additionally, unit funding of CE-related
requirements prevents the CE from receiving credit in their funding lines where it is more
appropriately executed. Units generally should reprogram their funds to the appropriate CE PEC
to accomplish the necessary work unless their dollars are fenced. However, there is no legal
violation that prevents organizations from using their own O&M funds for facility work,
particularly in cases of low dollar/low priority ―minor‖ requirements. Organizational
commanders must be cautious about spending their scarce unit O&M funds for CE-related
facility work prior to committing their funds for these requirements. Keep in mind, there are
risks involved, especially if unforeseen site conditions are encountered after the project work
begins, that would require additional funding from the appropriation originally cited on the
contract. This can pose an extreme funding hardship for organizations that are funded with
limited BA 01/03/04 dollars if they elect to use these funds for requirements that are normally
funded from CE O&M 3400 accounts.

                     OTHER CIVIL ENGINEERING (CE) SERVICES

15.1. Custodial Services.
   15.1.1. AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, Chapter 1, provides for the use of
   contract custodial services. HQ AMC funds custodial services at a level necessary to support
   AMC established standards. Units must fund those services above the AMC standard with
   local funds.
   15.1.2. Charge contract custodial services and refuse collection for TWCF facilities to the
   TWCF.
   15.1.3. Use the applicable five digit 531 or 533 EEIC shred to program, obligate, or expense
   custodial services and refuse collection.
   15.1.4. NAF employees may perform custodial and bed-making services in VAQs.
15.2. Architect-Engineer (A-E) Design Services. These services are O&M, TWCF, or MFH-
funded. Contract and in-house A-E design services are common support functions and the host is
responsible for budgeting and funding support functions common to all tenant O&M-funded
organizations to the extent the tenant is not self-supporting. The only exception to this general
rule is contract services for off-base tenant units when the host does not have the organic
capability to provide the support. Submit O&M requirements where AMC is the host to HQ
AMC/A7R. Do not reprogram funds out of A-E services without HQ AMC/A7R/FMA approval.
   15.2.1. A-E Design Costs Supporting TWCF MC Projects. Fund these costs from the TWCF
   Capital Budget, BPAC 210XX, for MC projects of $100 thousand or greater. Exclude A-E
   design costs for MC projects from the project cost determination to comply with the $750
   thousand statutory ceiling. However, capitalize the A-E design cost as part of the
   modernization-MC Capital project in accordance with OUSD(C) policy. Fund A-E design
   costs associated with R&M projects under $100 thousand and sustainment projects,
   regardless of the dollar amount, from the TWCF Operating Budget, BPAC 101. A-E funding
   for Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) counts against the $750K MC threshold.
   When a TWCF project has a MR and MC component, the A-E design is funded from the
   account that involves the predominant work. As an example, a project with total estimated
   costs of $1.0M ($350,000 MR and $650,000 MC) will have all of its design funded out of the
   TWCF MC account.
15.3. Recycling Program. DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 11A, chapter 5, paragraph 050202.D.
(et seqq.), and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.37. (et seqq.) provide guidance on
collections of proceeds from the sale of recyclable materials under the Resource Recovery
Recycling Program (RRRP). This program is codified in Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2577.
15.4. Other CE Services.
   15.4.1. Fund contracted CE custodial, refuse collection, and grounds services for TWCF-
   assigned facilities from TWCF Operating funds, BPAC 101.
   15.4.2. Record TWCF and O&M contracts for solid waste and disposal services to EEIC
   53330. Collect applicable reimbursements for these services to the EEIC that bore the
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       87


   original cost (i.e., EEICs 1XX, 60X, etc., for in-house services). For grounds services
   contracts, use EEIC 53310.
   15.4.3. Cleaning of family housing units is a proper charge to MFH, Fund Code 3Y, P722.
   15.4.4. The BCE is responsible for the cleaning of all permanently installed carpet, when
   authorized with O&M 3400 funds. If contractual carpet cleaning is not part of the custodial
   contract, use O&M funds, EEIC 53116. For contractual carpet cleaning of TWCF facilities,
   use TWCF funds, EEIC 53116.
15.5. Federal Facility Compliance Guidance (FFCG).
   15.5.1. Provisions of the FFCG signed into law 6 October 1992 are as follows:
      15.5.1.1. Does not hold federal employees personally liable for penalties if acting within
      the scope of their employment.
      15.5.1.2. Waives sovereign immunity for civil fines and penalties.
      15.5.1.3. Allows environmental regulatory agencies to impose civil penalties for
      violations of federal, state, or local solid and hazardous waste laws.
   15.5.2. For accounting purposes, record payments for any fines or penalties to PE 41856,
   Environmental Compliance, and the appropriate 5-digit 684 EEIC of the appropriation that
   bears responsibility at the affected installation. HOST/TENANT APPLICATION: AFI 25-
   201, paragraph 2.7.2. addresses environmental concerns for support agreements. DoD tenants
   are responsible for civil fines and penalties attributable to their operations because they are
   considered direct incremental costs in accordance with DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6. and
   enclosure 6, paragraph E6.1.2. (electronic version) For Air Force tenants, if the tenant
   mission involves working with hazardous materials, the funding for environmental fines and
   penalties should be negotiated in the host/tenant support agreement. If the host is directly
   responsible for environmental non-compliance within the tenant‘s assigned area, the host
   pays the fine/penalty as well as any clean-up/disposal costs.
   15.5.3. In accordance with HQ USAF/ILE memorandum dated 10 May 01, Subject:
   Payment of Fines, Penalties, and Supplemental Environmental Projects, fines and penalties
   for violations assessed as a result of corrective action or clean-up of inactive waste
   management units may be paid from the Environmental Restoration Account (ERA), PE
   78008F, and the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 684, or from PE 41856F. This is also
   applicable to supplemental environmental projects (SEPs - projects performed in lieu of fines
   and penalties levied by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)). Do not defer or
   displace any funded Level 0 or Level 1 environmental quality projects to pay for fines
   penalties, or SEPs.
   15.5.4. For TWCF-assigned organizations, environmental non-compliance fines and
   penalties are paid from TWCF Operating (BPAC 101) funds by the TWCF organization that
   is directly responsible for the incident. SAF/FMB memorandum dated 23 Feb 93, Subject:
   Federal Facility Compliance Act Guidance, directs DBOF (WCF) activities to pay these
   fines/penalties specific to their operations.
15.6. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Spill.
 88                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   15.6.1. Tenant organizations on AMC bases found to be responsible for a hazardous material
   spill will fund all clean-up costs from their local O&M-type funds. For AMC units, establish
   a locally assigned ESP code to collect costs incurred and submit to HQ AMC/A7A/A7R for
   validation and reimbursement based on funding availability.
   15.6.2. The tenant organization generating the spill pays the direct costs of response to spill
   incidents, such as expenses for supplies and equipment, equipment rental, site restoration,
   and contracts for spill response services. These costs must comply with support categories
   identified in DoDI 4000.19 (for interservice and interagency tenant support) and AFI 65-601,
   Volume 1, chapter 7, figure 7.1. and paragraph 7.5. (intraservice (Air Force to Air Force)
   tenant support). As a general rule, HAZMAT spills constitute a service over and above
   standard host support.
15.7. Funding for Signage.
   15.7.1. Signs for the exterior of facilities that are not unique are funded by the CE
   organization. An example of a unique sign requirement would be a marquee in front of the
   club, bowling alley, golf course, or any other facility.
   15.7.2. Signs for the interior of facilities provided by contract are unit-funded from the
   applicable organization. For TWCF-assigned organizations, BPAC 101 applies; do not
   charge to the Maintenance and Repair (MR) BPAC 3XX.
   15.7.3. Signs for the interior of facilities that are provided by the CE in-house workforce for
   a TWCF-assigned facility are funded and reimbursed under BPAC 3XX, EEIC 52720. If the
   CE organization does not have TWCF BPAC 3XX in-house funding available to accomplish
   the work, the TWCF organization will reimburse CE O&M from TWCF BPAC 101 funds,
   using EEIC 52720.
   15.7.4. Signs for the interior of facilities that are provided by the CE in-house workforce for
   a host O&M facility are accomplished on a non-reimbursable basis, as a general rule.
   However, if the signs are a unique requirement of the unit occupying the facility, the unit
   reimburses the CE organization from their O&M funds.
   15.7.5. Non-facility signs (e.g., directions to specific facilities located along roadways and
   intersections and other informational signs) are funded by the host CE organization without
   reimbursement.

                               EDUCATION AND TRAINING

16.1. Military Personnel.
   16.1.1. Military Tuition Assistance (TA). HQ AMC/FMA issues funds to each base for the
   TA program in PE 89732.
   16.1.2. AMC Job-Related Short Course Education. Use unit O&M or TWCF funds, EEIC
   5583Z, for cost of tuition, registration fees, and other contractual costs of job related courses
   covered by the ETCA (see paragraph 8.11.1. of this publication). Use the RC/CC of the
   individual's unit of assignment. Charge any required TDY costs associated with
   training/education to the RC/CC of the individual's unit of assignment. Local management
   of the programs rests with the Education Services Officer.
   16.1.3. ROTC Summer Encampments. Support provided to ROTC summer encampment
   (i.e., secretarial assistance, additional cooks, janitorial services, laundry and dry cleaning
   services, communications, supplies, etc.) is properly chargeable to PE 84723.
16.2. Civilian Personnel.
   16.2.1. Locally Funded Training. HQ AMC/A1 maintains oversight for this program in
   AMC, under PE 88751F. Prior to FY06, this program was centrally managed by HQ USAF
   and the 11 SW issued funding documents to each AMC base through OAC 57. This program
   is now decentralized and each MAJCOM receives funding for its requirements direct from
   SAF/FMB. At base level, the servicing Military Education Office (MEO) has the
   responsibility of managing these funds. This program applies to host organizations as well as
   Air Force tenants that reside on the installation. AMC units located on a non-AMC
   installation should complete and return any training requirement survey letters to the host
   MEO for inclusion in the installation‘s training plan. Use the appropriate 2-digit shred of
   EEIC 553 to record these costs.
   16.2.2. TWCF Civilian Personnel. Personnel coded to TWCF PEs should use the RC/CC of
   the individual's unit of assignment and local TWCF funds to cover the cost of civilian
   training requirements. Use the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 553 to record these costs.
16.3. Continuation Training. You may use unit funds to pay costs for military and civilian
personnel to attend professional courses designed to enhance their skills. Do not use unit funds to
pay for training required to qualify personnel for their assigned Air Force position (e.g., medical
and legal licenses – see paragraph 20.18 of this publication).
16.4. Funding of Training Courses Required for Military Members as a Result of
Convictions for Civil Law or Traffic Violations. There is no authority to use government
funds to pay for professional courses mandated due to convictions for violating civil law (e.g.,
driving under the influence of alcohol/ drugs, driving while intoxicated, and similar offenses).
These costs are considered personal expenses and are the responsibility of the member who was
convicted of the civil offense.
16.5. Funding Training for Contractors. You may fund for contractor training if it is a
necessary expense to the Air Force, e.g., in cases where the Air Force makes changes to a system
 90                                                                AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


or process that is maintained by the contractor, and other similar circumstances. Do not fund
contractor training in order to qualify them to perform their job unless circumstances caused by
the Air Force require additional training.
16.6. Professional Development. Appropriated funds are authorized to conduct ―day trips‖
(e.g., bus rental) to visit battlefields and other significant historical sites within the local area if
accomplished under the auspices of an established professional development program curriculum
for military members and civilian employees. Generally, these trips should be conducted during
official duty hours and the attendees are not entitled to per diem allowances. You may also
purchase books or other reading material from an approved reading list (approved by competent
authority, e.g., SAF/FM, HQ USAF/IL, etc.) to promote/foster functional professional
development, provided the books are not already part of the base library‘s inventory. Prior
approval is required from the base library before using unit funds to purchase these
books/reading materials. These items must be made available to any individual working in the
organization of the echelon (i.e., the MAJCOM, base, etc.) responsible for procuring the material
and they remain the property of the U.S. Government, to be accounted for on property book
records.
16.7. Mandated Training Provided by Commercial Sources. Appropriated funds (or unit
funds) are authorized to pay for any training requirement provided from commercial sources that
is mandated by DoD or Air Force Regulations. An example of this is motorcycle safety training
directed for military personnel by DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program and AFI 91-207,
The U.S. Air Force Traffic Safety Program, paragraph 13. The member‘s unit GPC may pay for
the training up front or the member may pay for the course and seek reimbursement via SF 1164
procedures.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       91

                     CONTRACT MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT

17.1. General Information. Your approved funding program provides sufficient funds to
support an acceptable level of maintenance for assigned equipment. Utilize in-house resources
and self-help programs for equipment maintenance to the maximum extent possible. Preventive
maintenance, daily care, and upkeep of equipment will also aid in minimizing your contract
requirements.
   17.1.1. Effective management of services performed by contract requires the involvement of
   each equipment custodian, CCM, RA, as well as the FMA, comptroller, and contracting
   officer. A coordinated effort produces responsive commercial maintenance in an economic
   fashion.
   17.1.2. The equipment custodian, through the RA, is responsible for submitting budget
   requirements for preventive maintenance of all office machines as generally defined in the
   Allowance Standard. Consolidate, cost, and present all requirements for preventive
   maintenance to the FWG for inclusion in applicable operating budgets.
   17.1.3. Each RCM or designated central manager should budget for non-preventive
   maintenance and preventive maintenance of all other assigned equipment.
   17.1.4. O&M Requirements. Once the FMB approves a preventive maintenance contract
   funding level, submit a consolidated request for repair of specific office equipment on one
   AF Form 9 or utilize the GPC, if applicable, to the base contracting office on an annual basis.
   An effectively managed program can only be the result of a total team effort. Identify your
   requirements properly and, more importantly, determine the most efficient, economic
   funding process. All requirements for equipment maintenance other than typewriters are the
   responsibility of the equipment custodian or work center.
   17.1.5. (DELETED)

Table 17.1. (DELETED)
17.2. Funding Approval. Upon approval of non-preventive maintenance and preventive
maintenance of all other equipment programs by the FMA, each RCM should be responsible for
initiating AF Form 9 procedures or GPC, if applicable. Use the CC identifying the functional
areas (or central manager) owning the equipment.
17.3. Preventive Maintenance Agreement (PMA) Determinations. The FMA office will
annually review each PMA to determine the cost effectiveness of the agreement. The RA will
provide all necessary information, such as number of repair calls in the previous contract period,
cost of previous contract, etc. The PMA determination will allow each commander to make
better decisions concerning whether the cost of the PMA is worth the service received.
17.4. Reimbursement for Accidents, Abuse, and Other Incidents to Government
Vehicles. AFI 23-302, Vehicle Management, chapter 1, paragraph 1.20. (et seqq.), provides
guidance for the reimbursement of vehicle repairs incurred by the base transportation squadron
resulting from damages and abuse not attributable to fair wear and tear. The using/owning
organization is responsible for these costs and will provide a direct fund cite or reimburse the

transportation squadron for any required repairs. For damage or loss of GSA motor pool
vehicles due to negligence, misconduct, abuse, or inattention of military or civilian personnel,
see DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph 120210.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     93

                           OTHER CONTRACTUAL SERVICES

18.1. Lodging of Alert Aircrews. Lodging fees of alert aircrews residing off-base and who
must respond to mission departure within one hour and are directed to stay on-base in
VOQ/VAQ-type quarters are payable from unit funds (TWCF or O&M, as applicable). Only the
lodging fees are chargeable; per diem is not allowed and members will continue to use their BAS
allowance to pay for meals consumed. If the lodging office permits, the unit can establish a
MORD in the accounting system and the Lodging Office can submit an invoice directly to the
unit resource advisor for reimbursement. If the Lodging Office directs payment by credit card or
check, the unit can use a GPC; however, this payment method may require the unit to transfer
obligations in the accounting system via Standard Form (SF) 1017, Journal Voucher, if a
command/Air Force ESP code has been issued to track the incremental costs of the circumstance
that results in the necessity for the aircrews to be lodged on base.
18.2. Laundry and Dry Cleaning.
   18.2.1. Laundry and dry cleaning service items used in TWCF aircraft are properly
   chargeable to the TWCF. Organization laundry and dry cleaning requirements for TWCF
   units (excluding personal clothing) are also chargeable to TWCF funds. Use EEIC 55915 or
   59300, as appropriate, for budgeting and funding laundry and dry cleaning costs.
   18.2.2. Use appropriated funds (APF) to clean linens and expendable items purchased with
   APF, or linens and expendable items authorized APF but purchased with NAF funds. Use
   NAF funds to clean other linens and items authorized and purchased with NAF (AFI 34-901,
   Laundry, Dry Cleaning, and Linen Exchange).

18.4. Contract Conversions. Any functional area may perform, at various times, a comparative
cost analysis in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities. In
 94                                                              AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


cases where these analyses indicate contract services will result in a lower overall cost to the
government, HQ AMC/ FMA will adjust the civilian pay, supplies, and equipment programs to
accommodate funding these services by contract. We will determine the civilian and military pay
transfers on the number of positions made surplus by accomplishing the work by contract.
18.5. Classrooms for Religious Activities. Charge all contractual costs associated with the use
of classrooms for religious activities to EEIC 55903.
18.6. Meal Surcharges.
   18.6.1. In accordance with HQ AFSVA/SVF memorandum dated 20 Aug 03, SUBJECT:
   FY2004 Subsistence-In-Kind Appropriation, the surcharge portion of cash collections for
   bases with dining halls under a full food service contract will be deposited into the base
   O&M (3400) account. Bases with food service attendant contracts or in-house operations will
   divide the collected surcharge between the O&M and AF MILPERS (3500) appropriation
   based on the percentage of military and civilian manpower authorizations in the local dining
   facility.
   18.6.2. For O&M (3400) reimbursements, use Sales Code 96 and EEIC 59907. For
   MILPERS (3500) reimbursements, use Project 562 and Sales Code 93A for medical dining
   halls and Sales Code 93B for non-medical.
18.7. Department of Defense (DoD) Observances. The Office of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Equal Opportunity, in conjunction with the DoD General Counsel,
authorized the use of APF for the procurement of scholarly lectures, ethnic historical exhibits, art
exhibits, displays, and musical groups associated with observances pertaining to with racial,
ethnic, or women‘s contribution to society. These activities should contribute to the welfare of
our military and civilian personnel by adding insight, meaning, and understanding to the
observances themselves. You may fund these endeavors during any fiscal year within the
constraints of your budget IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.26.1. This
guidance is within the intent of Comptroller General Decision B-191737.
18.8. Honoraria/Speaking Fees. Follow guidance in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4,
paragraph 4.9., for funding honoraria and speaking fees. You may use the GPC as the contracting
vehicle to procure approved honoraria, where accepted. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP,
paragraphs 4.9. and 4.9.3. concerning the acceptance of honoraria by military and civilian federal
employees. NOTE: Authorized travel/per diem costs funded on TDY orders for military
members/federal employees to present a speech, lecture, or presentation in an official capacity
does not constitute an honorarium.
18.9. Awards, Gifts, and Trophies.
   18.9.1. You may use TWCF or O&M funds, as appropriate, for non-cash awards (trophies,
   plaques, certificates, and similar items) associated with formal mission accomplishment
   awards for military and civilian personnel (AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, and
   AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.) and on-the-spot mission accomplishment
   award recognition, as authorized by local supplements of AFI 36-series instructions.
   Examples of formal mission accomplishment awards include Airman or NCO of the Quarter,
   Safety, Fire Prevention, Utility Conservation, etc. Merchandise items such as engraved
   coffee cups, belt buckles, coins, jackets, with a nominal cost (as determined by the local
   commander‘s discretion) presented in lieu of a trophy, which display the organizational
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     95


  logo/decal and recipient‘s name and accomplishment printed thereon may also be used.
  NOTE: You may also use the same coin purchased with unit funds for mission
  accomplishment awards to present to military members for reenlistment (AFI 65-601,
  Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.2.1.).
     18.9.1.1. If the award recipient desires to have the presenter‘s name engraved on the coin
     or medallion, he/she must use personal funds for this purpose unless the Secretary of the
     Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, a 4-
     star general officer or civilian equivalent are presenting the coin (AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
     chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.2.).
     18.9.1.2. If the award recipient desires to have the presenter‘s name engraved on the coin
     or medallion, he/she must use personal funds for this purpose (AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
     chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.2.).
  18.9.2. AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program, provides guidance
  concerning civilian employee cash awards for performance, sustained superior performance,
  quality step increases, etc. Award nominees, by virtue of their nominations, cannot receive
  APF-funded awards or trophies.
  18.9.3. Retirements, PCS departures, or similar events are not considered as acts of mission
  accomplishment and therefore not eligible for APF support. NOTE: You may purchase a
  U.S. flag to present to active duty military members upon retirement unless the individual
  was previously presented a flag under the authority of 10 U.S.C. Sections 3681/6141/8681,
  or 14 U.S.C. Section 516. Use GPC checks to obtain U.S. flags flown over the nation‗s
  Capital from the federal agency that sells them for this purpose, as they do not take the GPC
  or accept purchase orders from base contracting. If it is not feasible to use a GPC check, a
  personal check may be used and the individual may seek reimbursement by filing a SF 1164,
  Claims for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business with the base FMA
  office. However, these circumstances should seldom be necessary, as military retirements are
  projected well in advance of the actual retirement date. Unit funding applies (TWCF or
  O&M). Do not use unit funds to purchase display boxes for the retirement flags or to provide
  U.S. flags for federal service civilian retirees.
  18.9.4. Sports competitions can use APF to purchase trophies and similar devices for
  presentation to winners of intramural sports and athletic competitions. The purchase of T-
  shirts for this purpose in lieu of trophies or plaques is allowable as long as it meets the
  criteria in paragraph 18.9.1 above. You may not authorize any other shirt and issue only one
  T-shirt per winner. Present awarded T-shirts in lieu of and not in combination with trophies,
  plaques, or any other type of award.
  18.9.5. Incentive and Awards Programs at Physical Fitness Centers. Per AFI 65-601,
  Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.5., ASD/FMP, in a 25 Jan 99 policy memorandum,
  outlined ―core standards‖ for the DoD physical fitness program. Accordingly, the use of APF
  (Fund Code 30 only) is authorized to purchase low-cost incentive items (T-shirts, ball caps,
  water bottles, etc., not to exceed $10 dollars per item) to encourage participants to complete
  specified and published exercise regimens at Air Force physical fitness centers. Do not
  provide cash as an incentive item. Also, do not purchase coins or medallions for these types
  of incentives with APF due to the high cost of creating a die. The use of TWCF funds for
 96                                                               AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   physical fitness incentives is also prohibited, as it is not in direct support of the global airlift
   mission.
   18.9.6. (DELETED)
   18.9.7. Under the ―necessary expense‖ rule, the use of APF or TWCF funds to pay for
   appropriate base-level awards does not extend to meals for the award winners, if the awards
   are presented at a luncheon or formal dinner at home station.
   18.9.8. Under no circumstances should you use APF to purchase gifts for military members,
   government employees, or private citizens/entities unless specifically authorized by law (AFI
   65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.). This extends to monetary donations and
   contributions to charitable organizations as well. The only authority to use APF for gifts is in
   situations where Official Representation Funds (ORF) are involved, as specified in AFI 65-
   603, Official Representation Funds – Policy and Procedures, paragraph 4.
   18.9.9. National Award Programs. APFs are authorized to pay entry fees for Air Force
   personnel to participate in award programs sponsored by National Organizations provided
   the award program relates to the nominee‘s specific functional area. See AFPD 36-28,
   Awards and Decorations Programs, paragraph 5.
18.10. Payments Received From the Sale and Lease of DoD Real Property.
   18.10.1. In accordance with DFAS-DE/ANA guidance, credit all proceeds from the disposal
   of excess Air Force real property (other than BRAC) and from leasing of non-excess real
   property, to the special fund accounts established pursuant to Sections 2805 and 2806 of the
   National Defense Authorization Act for FY91 (Public Law 101-510). These accounts are
   975188.57, Disposal of DoD Real Property, and 975189.57, Lease of DoD Real Property. Do
   not credit any of these collections to miscellaneous receipts.
   18.10.2. Under the law, do not distribute amounts credited to these two accounts to the bases
   that generated the proceeds of the sale or lease until an Appropriation Act specifically makes
   them available for expenditure and DoD allocates the amounts collected back to the Air
   Force, as follows:
       18.10.2.1. Apply 50 percent for facility sustainment (EEICs 52100 and 52400) and
       restoration (EEIC 52200) or environmental restoration at the installation where the
       property is located.
       18.10.2.2. Apply 50 percent for facility sustainment (EEICs 52100 and 52400) and
       restoration (EEIC 52200) and for environmental restoration by the Military Department
       concerned.
       18.10.2.3. Credit payments for utilities and services furnished for lessees pursuant to
       leases entered into under 10 U.S.C. 2667 to the appropriation account that originally
       funded the utilities and services.
   18.10.3. Since the Air Force may not use the funds collected until DoD allocates to the Air
   Force the amounts credited to these accounts, it is important to properly credit the collections
   to these two accounts. You must transfer any proceeds for the sale of Air Force excess
   property (excluding BRAC) or leases of non-excess real property credited to accounts other
   than those listed in paragraph 18.10.1 through the use of a ―no check drawn‖ SF 1081,
   Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       97


   18.10.4. Adjust the accountable records for Air Force real property, maintained in
   accordance with AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting, to reflect the
   transfer or disposal of property. AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real
   Property, establishes the authority, policy, and procedures and designates responsibilities for
   leasing Air Force real property.
18.11. Open Houses, Air Shows, Aerial Demonstrations, Static Displays, Museums, Air
Parks, and Other Community Relations. Refer to AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open
Houses, for Air Force policy concerning base open houses and air shows/aerial demonstrations.
Chapter 6 and Attachment 4 of this AFI provide funding guidance; chapter 7 provides legal
guidance.
18.12. Purchase of Books, Periodicals, Newspapers, and Pamphlets.
   18.12.1. In accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.38., the base
   library purchases all mission essential commercial books, periodicals, newspapers and
   pamphlets for Air Force organizations with APF, centrally managed by HQ
   AFMPC/DPMSOLL. AFI 34-270, Air Force Library and Information System (AFLIS),
   chapter 4, designates those specific organizations and types of publications exempt from
   centrally funded procurement. Additionally, attachment 6. of AFI 34-270 provides a list of
   publications that are not authorized unit funding. Do not use APF or TWCF funds to
   purchase books, periodicals, videos, cassettes, compact discs, or any other publication to
   establish ―mini-reference libraries‖ within a typical base organization unless authorized by
   specific statute or regulation.
   18.12.2. Medical facilities are exempt and should procure publications in accordance with
   AFI 34-270.
   18.12.3. For non-mission essential recreational type periodicals and newspapers for lodging,
   recreation centers, youth activity facilities, etc., primarily concerned with MWR programs,
   use NAF funds. Don‘t use NAF funds to purchase newspapers and periodicals for offices,
   work areas, or waiting areas that are not associated with MWR programs, per AFI 34-201,
   Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAF), chapter 4, paragraph 4.2.3.
   18.12.4. The commander or staff agency chief determines if a publication is mission
   essential. When a disagreement occurs over the publication category (mission
   essential/nonessential), the commander or staff agency chief's decision is final.
   18.12.5. Use MFH funds (P72X) to purchase mission essential publications related directly
   to the primary mission of Housing Referral Offices (HRO). The local librarian coordinates on
   all Air Force Form 9s, records the expenditure and retains one copy. However, the library's
   centrally managed O&M fund procures mission essential publications in support of the
   general and administrative management of the HRO. In accordance with AFI 34-270, do not
   bypass the centrally managed library program.
   18.12.6. You may use APF to purchase applicable books that are incorporated as a part of a
   reading program in conjunction with an official professional military education course
   offered at your installation. However, purchasing books with APF or TWCF funds to provide
   to Air Force members in order to increase their general knowledge is not authorized.
   Coordinate authorized requests with the local base library prior to spending unit funds for
   this purpose.

   18.12.7. You may use APF or TWCF to fund for squadron newsletters when printed from
   office PCs or E-mailed to members‘ home/office computers. Do not use DAPS or any other
   commercial printing source to print and distribute squadron newsletters. Additionally, APF
   or TWCF funds are not authorized to pay for postage to mail squadron newsletters printed
   from office PCs to squadron members‘ private residences.
18.13. Refreshments at Awards Ceremonies. You may use APF for refreshments at award
ceremonies for military members and civilian employees in accordance with AFI 65-601,
Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.31. TWCF funds may be used if the individual recipient of the
award is assigned to a TWCF unit. See additional guidance in paragraph 18.13.5 below.
   18.13.1. For civilian employees, the Federal Personnel Manual (Chapter 451, Subchapter 2-
   2c) states that it is appropriate on such occasions to provide light refreshments at nominal
   cost for awards ceremonies, under authority of 5 U.S.C., Section 4503.
   18.13.2. 10 U.S.C., Section 1124 provides somewhat similar authority on light refreshments
   of award ceremonies for military personnel by stating: "and incur necessary expenses for the
   honorary recognition of a member of the armed forces under his jurisdiction, who by his
   suggestion, invention, or scientific achievement contributes to the efficiency, economy, or
   other improvement of operations or programs relating to the armed forces."
   18.13.3. An example of light refreshments is coffee and tea and a serving of dessert or
   snacks. Alcoholic beverages of any kind, complete meals, buffets, banquets, smorgasbords,
   etc., do not qualify as light refreshments.
   18.13.4. Use necessary prudence and discretion in authorizing the use of APF for light
   refreshments at awards ceremonies. A commander should first determine that a reception
   with light refreshments, in accordance with Office of Personnel and Management (OPM)
   regulations and 10 U.S.C., Section 1124 would materially enhance the effectiveness of an
   award ceremony before approving the use of APF for refreshments at the ceremony. Charge
   the cost of these light refreshments to each command's primary O-1 Line Item (BA 02 for
   AMC), not to Official Representation Funds (ORF).
   18.13.5. In accordance with Comptroller General Decision B-223319, July 86, the use of
   APF for light refreshments at award ceremonies is applicable to only those awards that are
   substantial in nature (e.g., Air Force (national) or command (regional) award), resulting from
   competitive type activities cited in the AFI 36-series directives and the Federal Personnel
   Manual. It does not cover PCS departures, retirement ceremonies, or other non-competitive
   type ceremonies where an award (e.g., an Air Force Commendation Medal or other service
   type medal or ribbon) may be presented to the departee, retiree, or newcomer.
   18.13.6. Funding for light refreshments may also be extended to significant unit award
   ceremonies to honor a notable milestone or other substantial unit achievement and the nature
   of the award warrants a distinguished visitor to formally present the award. (See AMCS1 to
   AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.31.)
   18.13.7. Funding for light refreshments may also be extended to ceremonies that involve the
   presentation of significant awards to military personnel for gallantry or heroism (e.g.,
   Congressional Medal of Honor, Air Force Cross, Airman‘s Medal). (See AMCS1 to AFI 65-
   601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.31.)
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        99


18.14. Conferences, Meetings and Seminars. In accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
chapter 4, paragraphs 4.42. through 4.42.6, the following Air Force funding guidance applies:
   18.14.1. Use unit funds for federal military and civilian employees to attend meetings and
   conferences when it is part of an authorized training program or directly relates to the
   individual‘s official duties. Attendees may pay a registration fee.
       18.14.1.1. If meals and lodging are an integral part of the registration fee, the attendee‘s
       travel orders and travel settlement voucher must identify the number of meals and
       lodging nights applicable to the registration fee.
       18.14.1.2. As a general rule, you cannot reimburse for meals consumed at an individual‘s
       duty station. The following are exceptions to this rule, based on Comptroller General
       Decision B-200650, April 86:
          18.14.1.2.1. The meals are a part of the registration fee and are an incidental part of
          the conference, meeting, or seminar.
          18.14.1.2.2. The meals are not a part of the registration fee and charged separately
          because (1) the meals are incidental to the conference, meeting, or seminar, (2) the
          attendance of the individual at the meals is necessary for full participation in the
          business of the conference, meeting, or seminar, and (3) the individual was not free to
          consume meals elsewhere without being absent from the essential formal discussions,
          lectures or speeches. NOTE: This exception is applicable only to civilian employees
          attending meetings and conferences sponsored by non-government organizations (5
          U.S.C., Section 4110). If the meeting or conference is an internal agency affair or
          applied as a training fee, the meals are not considered reimbursable (Comptroller
          General Decision B-230576).‖
       18.14.1.3. Merely calling the cost of the meals a ―registration fee‖ will not avoid the
       prohibition that unit funds cannot be used for entertainment, including food, except where
       specifically authorized by statute, especially in circumstances where the registration fee
       covers only the cost of the meals
   18.14.2. Air Force organizations sponsoring a conference, meeting, or seminar not under the
   authority of formal training guidance should use their unit funds to pay for speaker fees,
   honorariums, off-base facility costs (excluding lodging), and other related costs in lieu of
   recovering these costs through a registration fee. Use AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, or
   unit GPC for contracting off-base conference facilities. See paragraph 18.8 of this chapter
   on the approval level amounts of honoraria and speaking fees.
   18.14.3. Hospitality Fees. Sponsoring organizations may levy a ―hospitality fee‖ on
   conference, meeting, or seminar attendees to pay for light refreshments served between
   sessions or to cover mementos and souvenirs. NOTE: The sponsoring organization may use
   APF to pay for light refreshments served at conferences or request the attendees to pay
   through a hospitality fee (see paragraph 18.14.4 below). The payment of hospitality fees
   from attendees is strictly voluntary and is not reimbursed from unit TDY funds or any other
   government fund. Do not authorize the payment of hospitality fees on travel orders.
   18.14.4. Light Refreshments. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.42.1.1,
   sponsoring organizations may use APFs to pay for light refreshments (to include paper
100                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  plates/cups, napkins, plastic silverware, etc., for those base facilities whose primary purpose
  is to support large conference gatherings) during conference breaks. A conference is defined
  as a meeting, retreat, seminar, symposium, convening of an official board, or other event that
  involves attendee travel. The Per Diem, Travel, and Transportation Allowance Committee
  (PDTATAC) defines light refreshments as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels,
  fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, muffins, and similar items. The PDTATAC approved the
  purchase of these items in the JFTR (part G, paragraph U2550) and the JTR (part S,
  paragraph C4950). NOTE: This is applicable for TDY attendees only (see CompGen
  Decision B-288266, 27 January 03) – permanent party conference attendees are not
  authorized APF-funded refreshments. The serving of refreshments between sessions of a
  conference is optional, not mandatory. The following guidance applies:
      18.14.4.1. Alcoholic beverages do not qualify as light refreshments.
      18.14.4.2. The purchase of light refreshments at a conference does not extend to ice
      breakers and/ or other social events. These are personal expenses of the individual
      attendees.
      18.14.4.3. Do not purchase light refreshments for local meetings primarily involving
      permanently assigned military or civilian members. These events cannot be classified as a
      conference in order to justify serving light refreshments. There must be a significant
      number of personnel (51 percent or more) in a TDY status in attendance, not merely one
      or two.
      18.14.4.4. If the sponsoring organization elects to use their unit funds to pay for light
      refreshments, they cannot pass the cost to the TDY attendees in the form of a registration
      fee. These costs are the responsibility of the unit sponsoring the event (see paragraph
      18.14.2 above).
      18.14.4.5. The purchase of fine china, silverware (sterling silver, silver/gold plated
      utensils, etc.), crystal, linen, and linen laundry services by conference facilities to serve
      light refreshments to conference attendees is not authorized. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
      chapter 4, paragraph 4.42.1.1.1.
         18.14.4.5.1. User Fees for Conference Centers. Conference centers or organizations
         with conference rooms cannot charge a ―user fee‖ to Air Force organizations wishing
         to use the facilities. Conference centers are O&M-funded and are not a revolving fund
         entity or a fee-for-service operation that would warrant charging a ―user fee‖ to offset
         their direct costs (except for snacks and refreshments). Non-Air Force tenant
         organizations may be charged a fee only if there were additional direct incremental
         costs incurred which the conference center would not have incurred had the tenant not
         used the facilities. Fees collected under these circumstances must be deposited as a
         miscellaneous receipt to the Treasury and not to the O&M account of the conference
         center (except for snacks and refreshments).
      18.14.4.6. The use of TWCF funds to purchase light refreshments at conference or any
      other associated conference costs is not authorized unless it is convened solely for the
      purpose of discussing TWCF-related business. Generally speaking, most conferences
      held at wing or command level will not fall into this category. Prudent judgment should
      prevail before committing TWCF funds for this purpose.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                      101


  18.14.5. The official who approves the conference, seminar, symposium, etc., and charges a
  registration fee is responsible to ensuring that no unauthorized charges are in the fee. Prepare
  a budget or worksheet that itemizes all costs included in the registration fee.
  18.14.6. Sponsoring activities may charge non-Air Force government attendees a fee which
  covers food or beverage costs as a minimum. For non-government attendees, include a pro
  rata share of other costs, if warranted, per DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 11A, Reimbursable
  Operations, Policy and Procedures, chapter 4. Deposit any fees collected for non-
  government attendees into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
  18.14.7. Non-Air Force Government Sponsored Conferences, Meetings, and Seminars.
  Charge registration fees and other official expenses to the attendee‘s unit funds. For Air
  Force attendees, registration fees must not include the cost of food or beverages provided by
  the sponsoring organization. If the attendee is in an official travel status, see paragraph
  18.14.1 above.
  18.14.8. Non-Government Sponsored Conferences, Meetings, and Seminars. Reference
  paragraph 18.14.7 above. If the sponsoring organization is unable to separate the costs of
  food or beverages from the total registration fee, the attendee‘s organizational funds may pay
  the registration fee in full.
  18.14.9. The base comptroller, or budget officer, as appropriate, should establish a local
  procedure to review all formal conference, meeting, and seminar requirements prior to final
  approval, to ensure compliance. See Chapter 8, paragraph 8.15 of this publication.
  18.14.10. Conferences, seminars, and similar meetings involving scientific, technical, and
  professional fields may employ a contractor to handle administrative arrangements. These
  meetings generally involve the Air Force Research Laboratory. Attendees may be charged a
  registration fee (collected by the contractor) to cover all costs associated with the contract,
  including a reasonable profit. See paragraph 18.14.1 above and Chapter 8, paragraph 8.15
  of this publication
  18.14.11. The Air Force may co-sponsor scientific, technical, and professional conferences,
  etc., with a non-Federal entity, in accordance with specific guidance stated in DoD 5500.7-R,
  Joint Ethics Regulation, chapter 3, and AFI 61-205, Sponsoring or Co-Sponsoring,
  Conducting, and Presenting DoD-Related Scientific Papers at Unclassified and Classified
  Conferences, Symposia and Other Similar Meetings. Air Force organizations acting as a co-
  sponsor should follow procedures in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.42.5.,
  regarding the payment of registration fees.
  18.14.12. Approval Authority for Off-Base Conferences and Meetings. AFI 65-601, Volume
  1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.2.4.2.3., states, ―For all MAJCOMs, the Vice Commander may
  delegate approval authority to Numbered Air Force Commanders for wing-level events
  only.‖ HQ AMC/CV memorandum to the HQ AMC Staff/AMWC (USAF EC) dated 13 Feb
  06, Subject: Approval Authority for Off-Base Conferences or Meetings, and 18 AF/CC
  memorandum to the AMC Wing/Airlift Group/Air Refueling Group/EMTF/TACC
  commanders dated 15 Feb 06, same subject, provide guidance on requesting approval for
  these events. These memorandums are available on the HQ AMC/FM Budget Policy CoP at
  located under ―Budget Policy Memos and Other Files‖.

   18.14.13. Conference Cancellation Fees. If a military member or Air Force civilian
   employee scheduled to attend a conference withdraws due to other pressing official mission
   requirements and is charged a cancellation fee, the member/employee may pay the fee (or
   receive reimbursement, if the fee is already paid out of pocket) from unit funds with their
   commander‘s approval. If the individual simply decides not to attend after being selected
   without ample notification, the cost of the cancellation fee is the individual‘s responsibility.
18.15. Canceled Hotel Reservations. The following paragraphs provide applicable guidance
concerning canceled hotel reservations, extracted from the GAO: Principles of Federal
Appropriations Law, Volume III, chapter 12, part 2f:
   18.15.1. As a general rule, the cancellation of hotel reservations within a reasonable time
   prior to the dates of the reservations involves no liability on the part of the government (41
   CompGen 780 (1962)). However, you may allow for a claim for the actual cost of unused
   hotel rooms if all of the following circumstances are met: (1) It is clear that the reservations
   were made by and on behalf of the government; (2) there is sufficient basis to conclude that
   the making of reservations gave rise to a contractual relationship between the hotel and the
   government; (3) the government failed to cancel within a reasonable time; and (4) the hotel
   attempted to mitigate its damages. Since the basis of the government‘s liability is contractual,
   either express or implied-in-fact, resolve any claims under the Contracts Disputes Act.
   18.15.2. Allowable claims must be distinguished from cases in which government
   employees receive reimbursement on a per diem basis and make their own contract lodging
   reservation on their own behalf. Under such circumstances, there is no basis for the
   government to pay a claim because the government was not a party to the agreement. The
   distinction is between cases involving the negotiation of block reservation of rooms on a
   contractual basis between the government and the hotel through official administrative
   action, and in cases where the agreement is essentially between the individual and the hotel,
   regardless if the reservation may have been made by another government employee on the
   traveler‘s behalf.
   18.15.3. Since claims for the cancellation of hotel reservations could be allowable on the
   basis of legal liability, it is necessary to find some contractual or similar binding arrangement
   between the government and the hotel whereby the government agrees to either pay for the
   rooms reserved or cancel within a reasonable time. However, evidence of the contractual
   arrangement need not necessarily be in writing. If the facts or evidence of a contractual
   relationship are borne out without actually having a written agreement, it is concluded that a
   contractual relationship did indeed exist and the government may be held liable for payment.
   18.15.4. Once the existence of a contractual agreement to either pay for the rooms reserved
   or canceled within a reasonable time is established, the government can avoid liability only
   by showing that the time of cancellation was reasonable. What is deemed ―reasonable‖ will
   depend entirely on the facts surrounding the circumstances involved in the particular
   incident.
   18.15.5. The hotel must generally attempt to mitigate its loss, and its attempts to do so will
   be relevant in evaluating the claim. If the hotel is able to fill the majority of the rooms
   canceled with new bookings, these efforts will be held sufficient to discharge the hotel‘s duty
   to mitigate its losses and absolve the government‘s liability.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         103


   18.15.6. Any liability by the government for canceled hotel reservations is ordinarily limited
   to the actual cost of the rooms (excluding profit margin). Certain other elements of damage
   may be allowed if it can be established that they represent a liability of the hotel regardless of
   occupancy (e.g., a Value Added Tax, service charges for staff wages). However, the loss of
   anticipated profits and miscellaneous revenue is too remote and speculative and is not
   allowable. Interest would be payable on a claim processed under the Contracts Disputes Act.
   18.15.7. Claims for canceled hotel reservations may also arise in contexts not governed by
   the Contracts Disputes Act. For example, if a government employee uses a credit card in an
   official capacity to guarantee a hotel reservation, and the credit card charged upon
   cancellation of the reservation, due to insufficient notice, the claim is reimbursable since the
   government would have been liable to the hotel under the same circumstances.
   18.15.8. If you receive a claim or bill from a hotel or other lodging facility that asks for
   payment due to canceled room reservations, contact your local JAG for assistance in
   determining if the claim is a valid and proper charge to Air Force funds (TWCF or O&M).
18.16. TWCF Contract and On Base Lodging Charge System. Refer to AMCI 65-602,
chapter 2, paragraph 2.4.5. (et seqq.), for authorized locations and procedures to charge lodging
costs of AMC aircrews traveling on AF Form 4327a to local TWCF funds in lieu of payments
from the individual aircrew members. Use EEIC 50504, not EEIC 409, to record these costs in
the accounting system; these charges are not processed as a travel payment.
18.17. Reconstitution of War Readiness Material (WRM) Assets. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-
601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.68., for funding guidance.
18.18. Passports and Visas. The 89 APS Passport and Visa Office, Andrews AFB MD, is the
primary liaison between AMC organizations and the U.S. Department of State for approving and
funding of official passports and visas. See AMCI 36-2102, Passports and Visas, for guidance
on funding for military and civilian personnel traveling overseas on official government
business.
18.19. Physical Fitness Facilities for TDY Members. Do not use APF to contract for physical
fitness facilities for members who are temporarily deployed to a location that does not maintain a
permanent military presence. See AFI 65-106, chapter 9, before contracting for these facilities at
locations where a permanent military presence does exist.
18.20. Promotional Items. You may use APF to fund promotional items that fall under the
auspices of AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.3.2., or if other existing Air Force
instructions allow for their purchase in order to secure compliance with mission-related
objectives (chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.3.1.). Use prudent judgment when approving the purchase
of these items, i.e., nothing extravagant or excessive that may be construed as wasteful spending.
   18.20.1. The use of TWCF funds for these requirements is not authorized in accordance with
   AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.6.25., unless absolutely clear that it exclusively
   promotes TWCF incentives or productivity enhancements that result in savings to TWCF-
   funded programs or an increase to TWCF customer revenue.
   18.20.2. When approving APF requests for promotional items, consider the following:
       18.20.2.1. Does it promote safety, crime and fire protection, or compliance with mission-
       related objectives?
 104                                                           AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


       18.20.2.2. Does it promote productivity enhancements and ideas/suggestions initiated by
       Air Force organizations or personnel that resulted in cost savings to the Air Force?
       18.20.2.3. Does it classify as advertising in order to potentially recruit new Air Force
       military members or the retention of current members?
       18.20.2.4. Does it generate awareness for the Air Force Pollution Prevention Program or
       the Health Promotion Program? (NOTE: The latter would be funded from Defense
       Health Program (Fund Code 2X) funds.)
   18.20.3. If it is clear the promotional requirement does not fall under one of the categories
   listed above, then it is not authorized for APF. If there is no tangible benefit derived by the
   Air Force, then it does not qualify as a necessary expense of Air Force funds.
18.21. Recognition Luncheons for Base Volunteers. APF may be used to purchase
tablecloths, centerpieces, recognition certificates/pins, and other similar items for volunteers
honored at a luncheon event if Air Force or AMC instructions authorize a volunteer recognition
program. For example, AFI 34-248, Child Development Centers, Attachment 2, paragraph
A2.9.6., and AFI 34-249, Youth Programs, paragraph 2.3.9.5., allow for volunteer recognition
programs. Use prudent judgment when determining requirements – costs should not be excessive
for the occasion and no unnecessary items should be purchased. The use of APF to pay for meals
or gifts for the honored volunteers or any other attendee at the luncheon is prohibited.
Additionally, the use of TWCF funds to support these events is not authorized unless the
volunteers are used primarily in direct support of TWCF-funded organizations that sponsor a
volunteer program authorized in applicable Air Force/command instructions. NOTE: There are
no provisions that allow the reimbursement for personal expenses that volunteers may incur (e.g.,
mileage, parking fees, toll, telephone calls, child care fees) while performing volunteer work at
an Air Force installation.
18.22. International Cooperative Administration Support Services (ICASS) Payment
Policy and Procedures. ICASS is the process by which military organizations are supported
and billed for services by the U.S. State Department. These bills normally flow through the base
comptroller for payment. SAF/ FMBOI memorandum dated 11 Oct 01 provided new guidelines
concerning ICASS payments and disputes, which are:
   18.22.1. The agency (base) pays or disputes an ICASS invoice within 90 days of receipt.
   18.22.2. If no dispute or payment is made, the ICASS service center will advise the agency
   (base) it has 180 days to pay the bill.
   18.22.3. If no payment is received within 180 days, ICASS services will be suspended
   except for (1) emergency medical services, (2) local guard services, (3) payroll services, and
   (4) emergency and building operations services.
18.23. Abandoned Personal Property. See AFI 31-204, Air Force Vehicle Traffic Supervision,
chapter 6, paragraph 6.6., for the proper disposition procedures of motor vehicles after
impoundment at Air Force locations and DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual,
chapter 4, paragraph 40., for the disposition of any lost, abandoned, or unclaimed privately-
owned personal property on a DoD installation. See also 10 U.S.C., Section 2575, Disposition of
Unclaimed Property.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                         105


18.24. Group/Squadron Aerobics/Physical Fitness Instructor. There is no authority to
contract for a group/squadron-specific aerobics/physical fitness instructor, whether it is a military
member, Air Force civilian employee, or an individual from a local physical fitness center. The
Air Force provides gymnasiums, Health and Wellness Centers, and Physical Fitness Centers for
all matters relating to health and exercise for military members and civilian employees.
Providing fitness/aerobics instructors in addition to these services is not a necessary expense of
the Air Force. EXCEPTION: You may use organizational funds to provide for contracted
Spinning Class Instructor (SCI) training when the base Fitness Center does not have the
manpower to provide this training to squadron physical training leaders under the auspices of
AFI 10-248, Fitness Program, as directed by the Air Force Chief of Staff (CSAF). The
organizational commander must determine this to be a necessary expense of the Air Force prior
to funding for the training.
18.25. Base Runway Closures. When an AMC base temporarily closes its runway due to
scheduled maintenance and repair, the FMA office should establish a local ESP code to capture
all incremental costs (O&M or TWCF) that occur as a result of the closure (e.g., relocation of
aircraft to an alternate site, increased aerial port activity relating to surface transportation of
airlifted cargo, other miscellaneous BOS-related costs). NOTE: Do not include the cost of the
CE runway repair project against the locally assigned ESP code. AMC bases should have an
operation plan established in the event a temporary runway closure is necessary to accommodate
maintenance and repair projects. For runway closures at other MAJCOM bases that have a
TWCF-funded tenant or for runway closures at AMC bases with a primary TWCF mission for
the purpose of airlifting passenger and cargo requirements in the global transportation system,
use TWCF funds to contract for ground transportation of moving passengers and cargo to/from a
temporary aerial port of embarkation/debarkation. If the host base provides the support in-house
or through a funded contract for these transportation requirements, the costs are reimbursable by
the TWCF aerial port. AMC TWCF tenants on other MAJCOM bases may also establish a local
ESP code to track and monitor their incremental costs resulting from the host base‘s runway
closure.

                                         Chapter 19

                              SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT

19.1. Credit/Non-Credit Turn-Ins. Turn-in transactions receive credit/non-credit based on
criteria outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part 2, chapter 13. The daily document register
(D04) provides sufficient detail to monitor turn-in transactions.
19.2. LRS Responsibilities.
   19.2.1. The LRS commander is responsible for effective, efficient, and economical LRS
   operation. One of the duties of the Chief of Supply is to assist in formulating and
   administering funds as well as advising and assisting with the following:
       19.2.1.1. Interpreting and using data produced by the standard base supply system for
       management and budget purposes.
       19.2.1.2. Determines optimum distribution of available Supply Management Activity
       Group (SMAG) obligation authority, and if necessary, contacts the Air Mobility
       Command Regional Supply Squadron (AMCRSS) for possible redistribution.
       19.2.1.3. Using supply management products to determine requirements and control
       expenditures.
       19.2.1.4. Formulation of the SMAG portion of the base budgets.
       19.2.1.5. Making recommendations to the Comptroller, FMB, and FWG on allocations
       of SMAG budget targets.
       19.2.1.6. Periodic reviews of the base budget and subsequent revisions.
   19.2.2. The Chief of Supply advises the base FMA officer of the status of SMAG obligation
   authority. If SMAG obligation authority is insufficient to requisition available customer
   demands, perform the following: (1) direct customer funds to other areas, (2) turn back
   customer funds to the command, and (3) establish customer demands as memo obligated due-
   outs and defer requisitions until SMAG obligation authority is available. This condition
   normally occurs during end-of-year processing only.
   19.2.3. Supply officers should be familiar with the above criteria, as set forth in AFMAN 23-
   110, Volume II, Part 2, USAF Standard Base Supply System, chapter 2, section B.
   Administration of the SMAG requires detailed planning--generated by activities in terms of
   requirements, assets on order, due-ins, and due-outs. Do not use customer funds to bypass the
   SMAG for items managed by the Chief of Supply (see AFI 65 601, Volume 1, chapter 18,
   paragraph 18.11.2., for exceptions).
   19.2.4. Zero Overpricing Program. Each customer has a continuing responsibility to question
   prices and quality of products received to ensure the Air Force receives what it pays for.
   AFM 23-110, Volume VII, Part 4, Zero Overpricing Program, outlines the procedures for
   challenging price or quality items.
19.3. Fuel Oil. For Military Family Housing (MFH), process fuel oil sales from the AFWCF
directly to the MFH appropriation when these costs are separately identifiable. For the Medical
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                  107


Treatment Facility (MTF), the BCE should initially fund fuel oil and receive reimbursement
from the DHP appropriation, using the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 596.
19.4. Budgeting and Funding for Dormitory Items.
   19.4.1. Dormitory Supplies and Linens. Per AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing
   Management and Operations, the BCE is responsible for budgeting, funding, and controlling
   dormitory supplies, including replacement linens. For AMC bases, these costs are budgeted
   and executed in PE 41879, Real Property Services (RPS); unit O&M or TWCF mission funds
   will not be used for this purpose. Per AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.1.4.7., TWCF
   reimburses O&M for these costs at AMC bases through the G&A process established at
   command level. For AMC TWCF tenants located on other commands‘ bases/installations,
   reimbursement is in accordance with local support agreement procedures.
   19.4.2. Furniture and Furnishings at Geographically Separated Units (GSUs). These tenant
   organizations are responsible for maintaining their own dormitories, including furnishings
   and custodial services. Budgeting and funding responsibilities for on-base tenant dormitory
   furnishings belongs to the parent command of the host base (AFR 65-601, Volume 1, chapter
   7, paragraph 7.5.3.3.).
   19.4.3. Replacement of Dormitory Furnishings/Appliances. Per AFI 32-6004, Furnishings
   Management, paragraph 2.1., the BCE through the Housing Flight is responsible for the
   management, maintenance, procurement, and repair of all government-owned appropriated
   fund (APF) furnishings and domestic appliances for dormitories, lodging, and family
   housing. The furnishings management office (FMO), through the housing flight chief and
   lodging manager, obtains APF budget requirements/estimates and provides them to the civil
   engineer resource advisor. For housing requirements, use MFH funds. APF requirements
   and associated purchases, for dormitories will be identified in O&M Program Element (PE)
   Code 41679F (effective 1 Oct 06), EEICs 619IF (initial furnishings) and 619RF (replacement
   furnishings), and Functional Account 014. Authorized APF requirements (ref AFI 32-6004,
   table 2.1.), and associated purchases, for lodging (visiting quarters/temporary lodging
   facility) will be identified in O&M PE 48531F APF funding of replacement
   furnishings/appliances must be accomplished with local funds. HQ AMC does not centrally
   manage or centrally fund these requirements. See paragraph 19.5 below for guidance on
   furnishings associated with a new or newly renovated dormitory.
19.5. AMC Unaccompanied Personnel Facility Improvement Program (UPFIP).
   19.5.1. The UPFIP is a continuing program that provides furnishings for newly
   constructed/renovated dormitories and dining facilities. This program enhances the living
   conditions of AMC unaccompanied personnel. AFI 32 6004, chapter 2, provides funding
   guidance for managing dormitory furnishings.
   19.5.2. UPFIP dormitory furnishing funds are issued in support of specific dormitory
   projects. They are not issued until the base CER requests the funding from HQ AMC/A7R,
   which is normally not earlier than six months prior to the Beneficial Occupancy Date (BOD).
   HQ AMC/A7A validates all requests for UPFIP dormitory furnishings funding. Use RC/CC
   XX4408 to record costs associated with dormitory furnishings. Supply SMAG obligation
   authority must be available for requisitioning action. HQ AMC/A7A/A7R projects annual
 108                                                           AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   supply SMAG obligation authority during the SMAG budget call (Apr-May timeframe) each
   year to AMCRSS.
   19.5.3. Use a separate PFMR and ORG code account structure to accurately segregate and
   identify these costs.
   19.5.4. Charge initial issue and replacement appliances for bachelor quarters authorized in
   Allowance Standard 414 to RC/CC XX4408, PE 41879. Charge the contract maintenance
   and rental of appliances under the provisions of AFI 32-1001, Operations Management,
   paragraph 13., and not to UPFIP.
19.6. Flying Clothing. The flying member's unit of assignment is responsible to pay for
required military flying clothing, to include desert (tan) flight suits for AMC aircrews deployed
to Southwest Asia. Units may use the GPC to procure desert flight suits. Suggested sources are
National Industries for the Blind (NIB)/National Industries for the Severely Handicapped
(NISH)-operated Individual Equipment Elements in Supply, DLA‘s ASCOT system, or direct
vendor. For direct vendor purchases, cardholders must ensure that the vendor meets all
requirements outlined in AFI 36-2903. Unit funds may also pay for the sewing on of Velcro
strips, patches, etc. of the flight suits. For TDY incident to formal retraining with a follow-on
PCS assignment, the losing organization of assignment should provide the required funding for
any applicable flying clothing required upon arrival for training.
19.7. Refueling of Transient Air Force Vehicles. The host base providing refueling support
funds for fuel issued to Air Force owned and operated transient vehicles (AFI 65 601, Volume 1,
chapter 7, paragraph 7.8.5.). This Air Force policy does not apply to ANG, AFRC, or non-Air
Force vehicles. These activities should continue to fund their refueling requirements. Use EEIC
641, to record issues that are the responsibility of the host base.
19.8. Mobility Bags and Mobility Equipment.
   19.8.1. O&M Funding Responsibility. This includes all costs (except Priority Improved
   Management Effort – Base Engineer Emergency Force (PRIME BEEF) and Priority
   Improved Management Effort – Readiness in Base Services (PRIME RIBS)) for (1) initial
   issues of host mobility bags and mobility equipment for O&M-funded units, (2) replacement
   issues of mobility bags (see paragraph for Chemical Warfare and Defense Equipment
   (CWDE) "C" bags) and equipment for O&M-funded units, and (3) obsolete items replaced
   by changes to the applicable Allowance Standard (considered initial issues).
   19.8.2. Charge mobility bag expenses in support of PRIME BEEF directly to the BCE using
   PE 41879F. Charge PRIME RIBS mobility bags to PE 48541F.
   19.8.3. TWCF Funding Responsibility. TWCF-funded units are responsible only for
   replacement issues for mobility bags and mobility equipment listed in an organization's Unit
   Tasking Code (UTC). Record costs to the applicable PE, based on unit of assignment.
   19.8.4. Assign and include in the LG PFMR all ORG codes using RC/CCs XX1207 and
   XX1208, one for O&M and one for TWCF.
   19.8.5. Charge security police Air Base Ground Defense (ABGD) team requirements to
   RC/CC XX4390, PE 27588F, and functional category 08.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       109


   19.8.6. Funding for tenant A and B mobility bag requirements and replacement items is the
   responsibility of the tenant in accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph
   7.5.3.
   19.8.7. First Aid Kits in Mobility Bags. In accordance with Technical Order (TO) 00-35A-
   39, the using organization will fund the initial issue of first aid kits for mobility bags on a
   reimbursable basis from the local medical supply account. Once they are initially issued, the
   replacement/resupply of shelf life assets in these kits are the funding responsibility of the
   medical logistics function of the local MTF.
19.9. Chemical Warfare Defense Equipment (CWDE) Funding Policy.
   19.9.1. Use normal host-tenant funding procedures for CWDE per AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
   chapter 7, figure 7.1, item #9.
   19.9.2. HQ AMC/A7XE administers the funds for Air Force budgeted initial and
   replacement requirements of CWDE.
   19.9.3. Charge "C" bag mobility requirements to O&M 3400 funds.
   19.9.4. The host will continue to fund for tenant CWDE requirements.
   19.9.5. Supply SMAG obligation authority must be available for requisitioning action.
19.10. (DELETED)
19.11. Snacks and Beverages on TWCF Aircraft. See AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph
6.3.1.4.6.
19.12. Contractor Operated Stores. Contractor-Operated Civil Engineering Supply Store
(COCESS) and Contractor-Operated Parts Store (COPARS) operations exist in AMC. It is
imperative that all personnel involved in administering these programs be intimately familiar
with the ―do‘s and don‘ts.‖ The Air Force delegated authority to the MAJCOMs to waive AFI
65-601, Volume 1, chapter 18, when terminating existing COPARS and COCESS contracts and
negotiating new contracts. Address requests for waiver authority to HQ AMC/FMF, 402 Scott
Drive, Unit 1K1, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5311.
19.13. Funding for Clothing and Tool Requirements Associated with Able Chief
Participants. Funding responsibility for authorized clothing and tools required by Able Chief
trainees rests with the maintenance squadron conducting the training.
19.14. Procurement of Permanently Installed Carpets and Wall-to-Wall Carpet Tile.
   19.14.1. For AMC facilities and projects where the BCE is the approving authority, the
   responsibility for budgeting and funding rests with the BCE.
   19.14.2. Use PE 41879F to record the cost of cleaning carpeted areas by service contract that
   is not included in the basic Base Custodial Contract, using EEIC 53116. This applies to all
   facilities on AMC bases except for DHP, AAFES, and TWCF facilities. See Chapter 14,
   paragraph 14.4.3. of this instruction for further discussion on funding for carpet installation
   in TWCF facilities.
   19.14.3. If the purchase of the carpet and installation is accomplished as part of a contract in
   a newly constructed facility or in conjunction with a restoration and modernization project,
   record the charge in RPMC, EEIC 529XX, and PE 41976F. Classify all other carpet
 110                                                           AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   replacement and installation by contract as sustainment-maintenance and record costs in
   EEIC 521XX, PE 41978F.
19.15. Memo Due-Outs for Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID)
Authorizations. You should establish memo due-outs in the supply system for all EAID
authorizations projecting a need. This method of establishing requirements provides each
custodian with the necessary management products to forecast budget requirements. It further
serves to identify those shortages where excess in use assets are transferable through functional
equipment transfer (FET) procedures and negate the need for customer funds. The possibility
exists (historically, at the close of the fiscal year) that customers may have available funds and
supply may not have corresponding SMAG obligation authority. When this occurs, LRS may
process the customer requests as memo-obligated due-outs to prevent the loss of customer funds.
LRS will delay requisitioning until SMAG obligation authority becomes available. If sufficient
SMAG obligation authority is not available to cover all memo-obligated due-outs, use the base
FWG and FMB as the forum to develop a priority list of requirements to assist in the allocation
of available SMAG obligation authority to meet the highest priority needs. As a minimum, invite
all major customers of the General Support Division (GSD) not represented on the base FWG
(organizations, tenants, etc., where the base FMB does not administer or supervise the funding)
to assist in the establishment of the priority list of requirements.
19.16. Capital Investment Equipment. Included in this category are Base Procured
Investment Equipment (BPIE), Communications, ADPE, and software development $250,000 or
greater.
   19.16.1. The total cost of a system (i.e., software installation, TDY, supplies, equipment,
   etc.) determines the appropriate threshold for Communications, ADPE, and software
   development costs. If the total cost is $250,000 or greater, fund the requirement with 3080
   Investment funds/TWCF Capital funds, as appropriate. Charge the cost for each piece of the
   system against the project to which they pertain. For example, Wing X is purchasing a piece
   of Capital ADPE equipment that requires testing prior to acceptance. To accomplish the test,
   an individual must go TDY. Charge the TDY costs to the applicable Capital budget (TWCF
   or 3080) and EEIC 409.
   19.16.2. Due to the limited funding that is received each year, you should constantly monitor
   your Capital program to ensure consideration of only the highest priorities.
   19.16.3. Use the following procedures for budgeting and funding of Capital equipment:
       19.16.3.1. The base FMA office, with the assistance of the LRS Funds Management
       personnel, develops installation requirements, including those of assigned tenants, and
       those identified for support to maintain Capital equipment.
       19.16.3.2. Under a WCF concept, an EA, cost comparison, or certificate in lieu of an EA
       must accompany requests for funding. For AMC, the FMA office presents the validated
       TWCF Capital requirements to the FWG and FMB. These committees prioritize the
       requirements and the FMA office forwards them to HQ AMC/FMA in the prescribed
       format for review.
       19.16.3.3. HQ AMC/FMA issues TWCF Capital and 3080 Investment funding
       documents to the respective bases. Report any unpurchased items for which you received
       funding in your FMB minutes.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       111


   19.16.4. Standard Warranties on Procurement-Funded Items. Standard warranties for items
   or software development purchased with procurement (3080-type) funds under the terms of
   the contract constitute a bona fide need of the procurement and are paid from the same
   procurement funds that sourced the item. This is not applicable to extended warranties after
   the original warranties have expired; these circumstances are considered options to the
   standard warranty and are purchased with O&M-type funds in the option year.
   19.16.5. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 8, paragraph 8.16. for BPIE Investment funding
   guidance and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 18, paragraph 18.5.1. for TWCF Capital
   funding guidance.
19.17. Centrally Managed and Procured Equipment Items. The following is HQ USAF/ILG
policy regarding centrally managed (3010 and 3080 procurement appropriations) equipment
items, as described in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 8, paragraph 8.16.3.
   19.17.1. The GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume I, chapter 2, directs
   that once an agency has determined which appropriation to use to fund particular goods and
   services, ―the continued use of the appropriation selected to the exclusion of any other for the
   same purpose is required, in the absence of changes in the Appropriation Acts.‖ The Air
   Force budgets for centrally managed items and Congress issues funding in the procurement
   appropriations. Whenever local units receive authorization to locally procure most of these
   items with item manager approval, use 3080 Investment funds, not unit O&M 3400 or TWCF
   funds.
   19.17.2. Current appropriation law is the basis for procurement (3080) funding of centrally
   managed and procured supply and equipment items. AFMC item managers need to be made
   aware of any equipment shortage and their mission impact to enable them to more efficiently
   prioritize Air Force requirements and make the proper adjustments to the requirements
   computation system. Unit workarounds circumvent this critical process as well as the
   congressional appropriation mandate. If an organization deems a particular centrally
   managed and procured equipment item to be inappropriately coded, they may request
   corrective action through the AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/ Action process, as
   detailed in AFMAN 23-110, Volume I, Part 1, chapter 7.
19.18. Entertainment, Recreational, and Food Serving Supplies.
   19.18.1. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.28., do not use APF to entertain
   government employees or any other persons, except in cases specifically authorized by law.
   Entertainment is defined as food, drink, live and recorded music, theatrical performances,
   and any other item or activity designed to entertain. Included in the prohibition are items
   used to prepare, serve, or present entertainment (such as food or drink, serving
   materials/equipment, loudspeakers, video recorders, etc.).
   19.18.2. Do not consider the following items as entertainment:
      19.18.2.1. Food and drink provided to military personnel as Subsistence-in-Kind (SIK).
      19.18.2.2. Reimbursable subsistence expenses (per diem) for persons in official travel
      status.
      19.18.2.3. Official representation requirements, as authorized by AFI 65-603.

       19.18.2.4. Samples of ethnic foods used in authorized ethnic awareness programs (see
       AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.28.1.4.).
       19.18.2.5. Light refreshments at awards ceremonies (reference AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
       chapter 4, paragraph 4.31.
       19.18.2.6. Military service bands, chorale groups and other groups that normally perform
       at base theaters or service clubs for the entertainment of base personnel.
       19.18.2.7. Programmed ―incentive music‖ designed to enhance morale by creating a
       pleasantly stimulating and efficient atmosphere during the workday.
       19.18.2.8. Snacks and beverages for passengers on TWCF organic aircraft, as per AMCI
       65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.1.4.6. Also, see paragraph 19.11 above.
       19.18.2.9. Light refreshments at conferences. See Chapter 18, paragraph 18.14.4, of
       this publication.
       19.18.2.10. Food preparation and serving items (e.g., coffee pots, glassware, cups and
       saucers, paper plates/containers/napkins, flatware or plastic eating utensils, and other
       serving items) for organizations that operate a conference center within their facility.
       Reference AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.42.1.1.1.
       19.18.2.11. Food and food serving supplies for the Drug Education for Youth (DEFY)
       program, as authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, in a memorandum
       released by AFMOA/ SGOC, 26 May 00.
   19.18.3. In addition to the prohibitions listed in paragraph 19.18.1 above, do not use APF
   for the following per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.28.2:
       19.18.3.1. Dance or combo created by members of military bands whose services are
       ―hired‖ by base open messes or service clubs for the purpose of entertaining members of
       these organizations.
       19.18.3.2. Fireworks displays.
       19.18.3.3. Food preparation and serving items for normal headquarters, wing, group, or
       organizational conference rooms or any other typical office environment (regardless of
       the personnel occupying it) that are primarily used for local meetings and other normal
       day-to-day uses (AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.42.1.1.1). This includes
       those command and protocol offices that frequently host DVs. See paragraph 19.18.2.10
       above for exception.
19.19. Break Area Furnishings. Consult AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.40.,
and AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 4.40.1. and 4.40.7. for funding guidance
concerning break area furnishings in the workplace.
19.20. Exchange and Trade-In of Items. Many commercial vendors allow a trade-in credit on
an item when buying a replacement item. Air Force activities should take advantage of these
exchanges when they benefit the United States government. Generally this is reimbursable,
whenever the trade-in allowance is greater than the anticipated sales proceeds of the Defense
Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). See AFMAM 23-110, Volume II, Part 13, chapter
8, section 8HI, for applicable conditions and restrictions.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                  113


19.21. Use of DHP Funds to Purchase Food Items for Health Promotion Functions. You
may purchase food items through the base Defense Commissary Agency (DECA) with Defense
Health Program funds. Charge these purchases to EEIC 60700 (Commissary support).
19.22. Depot Level Reparables (DLRs). Effective 1 Oct 07 (FY08), all DLR requirements are
budgeted and funded by HQ AFMC under the Consolidated Asset Management Program. For
O&M 3400 (Fund Code 30), DLRs, funding transferred from HQ AMC to HQ AFMC; for
TWCF (Fund Code 68), DLR requirements are reimbursed by HQ AMC/FMAT to HQ AFMC.
HQ AMC/FMA will not issue funding to AMC locations for new DLR requirements after 30 Sep
07.

19.23. Aviation Fuel (AVPOL) Decentralization. NOTE: As of FY07 (1 Oct 06) AVPOL is
now centralized under AFMC for O&M 3400 (FC 30). TWCF (FC 68) remains decentralized
and the subsequent paragraphs apply only to TWCF.
   19.23.1. AVPOL funding for TWCF carries a fence and an OF2 and T40 limitation
   respectively. The Air Force approved flying hour program determines applicable funding
   along with the individual wing consumption rates, and the average cost per gallon of fuel.
   Underflying your programmed hours does not equate to a savings. HQ AMC/FMAT will
   withdraw AVPOL funding for under flown hours. The wing/group FMA office must closely
   monitor actual consumption and expenditures to ensure over obligations do not occur. A
   monthly AVPOL report is due to HQ AMC/FMAT not later than the 15th calendar day of
   each month. NOTE: If the 15th calendar day falls on a weekend or holiday, the report is due
   the following business day. Format for the TWCF AVPOL monthly report is available on the
   HQ        AMC/FM         Budget       Policy     Community        of       Practice      at

   19.23.2. In FY01, the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) capitalized all AVPOL and
   fuel processing at Air Force Locations. In addition, DESC continues to capitalize AVPOL
   and fuel processing at other DoD installations. DESC is also responsible for processing of the
   Aviation Into-plane Reimbursement Card (AIR Card), Into-Plane Contract, and SF 44,
   Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, commercial purchases. When DESC capitalized Air Force
   AVPOL processing, there was a requirement to change the AF Form 1896 (fuel identiplate)
   on all AMC aircraft, so obligations and bills could be routed directly to the servicing DFAS
   field site and paid directly by the owning wing. The identiplate now contains the customer
   identification code (CIC) (AMC), the organization code for the applicable owning wing, the
   tail number of the aircraft, the host or primary Department of Defense Activity Address Code
   (DoDAAC) of the base where the aircraft is assigned, the applicable Fund Code (68), and a
   Signal Code of ―A‖.
       19.23.2.1. In conjunction with capitalization of fuel processing, DESC developed a Fuels
       Automated System (FAS) for the processing of fuels transactions and the FAS Enterprise
       Server (FES) web site for AVPOL management. All Air Force locations and most DoD
       locations process transactions through FAS into FES. DESC personnel process AIR Card
       and SF 44 transactions into FES. When a fuel transaction is processed into FES, an
       individual or summary record is created. NOTE: A summary obligation consists of
       multiple fuel transactions input on the same day for the same organization/aircraft
       combination. An obligation file is created at the end of every business day and forwarded
       to the applicable DFAS field site for posting of an AEU under a specific FES document
       number. The document number is comprised of the aircraft‘s assigned host DoDAAC, the
       Julian date of the fuel transaction, the alphabetic letters ―FF‖ or ―FA‖, and a system-
       assigned alpha/numeric combination (e.g., FP44252035FF01). The FES has reduced the
       requirement to establish a MORD until the end of the fiscal year. Around the 27th of each
       month, DESC creates a bill containing the document number and other applicable
       information for the obligation created during the month and sends to the DFAS field site
       servicing the wing/base. When the bill processes, the obligation moves from the AEU
       stage of accounting to AEP.
       19.23.2.2. Currently, some DoD locations and all Into-Plane Contract fuel transactions
       are not processed into FES. These fuel transactions are input directly into the DESC fuels
       billing system and no prior obligation is created for these transactions. Monthly, the
       wing-servicing DFAS field site receives these bills and cannot process them because
       there is no obligation in the accounting system to match against the document numbers.
       These are known as ―non-hub‖ bills. A MORD is required to cover non-hub bills and
       should be established in the UOO stage of accounting for all fund codes. The non-hub
       bills require manual intervention between the DFAS field site and base-level
       FMA/WRDCO to determine the aircraft and MORD to charge. The document number is
       similar to the one described in paragraph 19.23.2.1 above with the exception of the last
       four digits, which should represent the last four digits of the applicable aircraft. At the
       end of the fiscal year, all MORD balances in the UOO stage of accounting for TWCF
       aircraft should be moved over to AEU.
19.24. Individual Clothing. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, section 10I, use
organizational O&M-type funds for the following individual clothing requirements:
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                    115


  19.24.1. Uniforms for the burial of deceased military personnel (except caps, shoes, or
  boots) if the uniform of the deceased is not presentable enough to warrant its use for this
  purpose.
  19.24.2. Clothing sales issues authorized by a medical officer for the following conditions:
  (1) The replacement of uniforms destroyed to prevent the spread of disease and (2) during or
  immediately following medical care when the previously altered uniforms are unusable after
  treatment.
  19.24.3. Personal clothing items for confined military personnel either discharged, or whom
  have discharges suspended or revoked and are in a non-pay and allowance status. The
  individual‘s unit commander is the approval authority.
  19.24.4. Enlisted grade insignia for free issue to newly promoted enlisted military personnel.
  Do not authorize the purchase of officer insignia.
  19.24.5. Enlisted grade insignia and accouterments for the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU)
  upon promotion and when enlisted personnel replace an unserviceable BDU, including the
  costs of sewing them on the uniform. NOTE: Whenever purchasing authorized uniforms
  with unit funds, (from an Allowance Standard), you may use the same unit funds to sew on
  any necessary accouterments and grade insignia.
  19.24.6. Distinctive Uniforms and Functional Clothing. Installation commanders may
  approve unit funding for these items as organizational clothing if the function of the unit
  require the mandatory wear of these items (basically outergarments only) to perform their
  official Air Force duties. See AFI 36-2903 for authorized distinctive uniform and functional
  clothing items. NOTE: The purchase of organizational clothing is optional, at the discretion
  of the commander.
  19.24.7. Unauthorized Use of Unit Funds for Clothing Items. See AMCS1 to AFI 65-601,
  Volume 1, paragraph 4.72. (et seq.).
  19.24.8. Introduction of New Clothing Items. Organizations that originate new clothing and
  textile requirements (i.e., initial introductions, change in use, or use by a new Military
  Service) must provide the initial funding. Military Departments with new clothing
  requirements must provide a funded order to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to cover
  acquisition costs to achieve a balanced procurement cycle quantity of the item. Charge new
  clothing bag items to the Military Personnel appropriation.
  19.24.9. Miscellaneous Clothing Sales. These are issues of clothing from the Clothing Sales
  Store not otherwise categorized. (See AFMAN 23-110, Volume I, Part 3, Air Force Stock
  Fund and DPSC Assigned Item Procedures (PA), chapter 2.) Use unit funds for these
  purchases.
  19.24.10. Athletic Clothing for Mandated Physical Training Programs. Do not use unit funds
  to purchase athletic clothing for any mandated physical training program unless it is
  specifically authorized in Allowance Standard 016. Athletic clothing is included as part of
  the initial clothing bag provided to new recruits at basic training. Any replacement of this
  athletic clothing must be purchased with personal funds. HQ USAF/ILSP has deleted the
  requirement in Allowance Standard 016 for athletic clothing incident to a mandated 3 days
  per week minimum physical training program.

   19.24.11. Civilian Uniforms. Consult AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.56.,
   for funding guidance regarding civilian uniforms and clothing. See also chapter 1, paragraph
   1.1.2. and chapter 6 of AFI 36-801, Uniforms for Civilian Employees, for additional
   guidance. (NOTE: HQ USAF/ DP approved fitness center civilian staff uniforms in Feb 00 –
   this is not reflected in the current publication (29 Apr 94) of AFI 36-801.) For Foreign
   National civilian employees, if the AMC organizational commander determines specific
   uniforms are necessary for the Air Force mission and approves the purchase, unit O&M-type
   funds may be used (see DoD 1416.8-M, DoD Manual for Foreign National Compenstaion,
   appendix 2, paragraph AP2.1.1.3.8. and AFI 36-801, chapter 1).
   19.24.12. Uniforms Issued as Individual Equipment. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10,
   paragraph 10.55.7., allows for unit funds to pay for these uniforms (e.g., desert BDUs/flight
   suits and other TA 016 uniforms that are not considered regularly issued uniforms) as well as
   the cost of any rank insignia, accouterments, name tapes, as well as the sewing on of these
   items on the uniforms. See AMCI 10-403, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Force Deployment,
   for guidance on keeping non-returnable assets in serviceable condition for future use and the
   frequency allowed for the reissuing of desert BDU uniforms. NOTE: Do not use unit funds
   to pay for normal uniform requirements that are the responsibility of the military member
   (funded through the clothing allowance entitlement) unless specifically authorized in AFI 65-
   601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.55.
   19.24.13. For desert BDU requirements of AFRC and National Guard Bureau (NGB)
   personnel (involuntarily mobilized or on MPA Man-days) assigned to unit-equipped
   AFRC/NGB organizations, who are performing AMC missions in Southwest Asia, HQ
   AMC/FMA will provide O&M 3400 funds through a centralized OAC/OBAN with NGB and
   AFRC. For Associate Reserve units at AMC bases, the active AMC unit will pay for the
   required desert BDU uniforms in performance of AMC missions. AMC units and HQ
   AFRC/NGB will use the appropriate contingency ESP code when recording these costs into
   the accounting system.
   19.24.14. Clothing Requirements for Mobilized (Non-Volunteer Activation) AMC-Gained
   ANG/ AFRC/IMA Personnel. Special uniform requirements (i.e., obtained from the
   Individual Equipment section of the LRS such as flight suits and desert BDUs) for activated
   mobilized ANG/AFRC/IMA personnel whose PDS is at an AMC location will be funded by
   the AMC active duty unit to whom they are accessed when directed by their commander or
   other competent authority (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.55.7.). This
   also includes any necessary rank insignia, name tapes, accouterments, and sewing of these
   items on the uniform. All other regularly issued uniform requirements (including exercise/PT
   clothing) are the responsibility of the ANG/AFRC/IMA member. See AMCI 10-403, for
   guidance on keeping non-returnable assets in serviceable condition for future use and the
   frequency allowed for the reissuing of desert BDU uniforms.
   19.24.15. Nametags for the New Air Force Service Dress Jacket. Use APF for the initial
   purchase of one per each assigned enlisted member only. Officers are responsible to purchase
   their own nametags for this uniform.
19.25. Sporting Equipment and Uniforms.
   19.25.1. AMC units may use APF to buy sporting equipment and uniforms for squadron
   intramural teams and base varsity teams. AFI 65-106, chapter 2, figure 2.1., classifies
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       117


   intramural sports as a NAF Class A activity and varsity sports (above the intramural level) as
   a NAF Class B activity, and qualifies for APF support. See Chapter 23 of this publication
   for a further explanation of NAF Category A and B activities.
   19.25.2. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.51., and AFI 64-117, Air Force
   Government-Wide Purchase Card Program, chapter 2, paragraph 2.2.12., you may use the
   GPC to purchase gym equipment and intramural uniforms (O&M funds only). However,
   written approval must be granted from the local SVS/CC prior to the purchase. All other
   MWR expendable and non-stock listed (e.g., toys, games, baseballs, bats, basketballs, etc.)
   are still ordered and processed through the services squadron in accordance with AFI 65-106,
   chapter 10, paragraph 10.11., and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 18, paragraph 18.13.2.
   19.25.3. Do not personalize sports equipment and uniforms purchased with APF. Individuals
   will not retain the uniforms or equipment after completion of the sporting events. These
   uniforms will be turned in to the appropriate organization after the last sporting event for
   reuse in future sporting events.
   19.25.4. TWCF-funded organizations will not use TWCF funds to purchase sporting
   equipment and uniforms, in accordance with AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.6.5.10.
   19.25.5. The use of APF to purchase sports uniforms does not extend to military dependent
   or other privately-sponsored sports teams.
19.26. Unit Level Fitness Centers and Exercise Rooms. Use APF for these requirements,
authorized only under certain conditions. Prior to establishing a unit mini-fitness center, consult
AFMAN 34-137, Air Force Fitness and Sports Operations, as well as the preface to Allowance
Standard 410. The requesting organizational commander is responsible for funding all purchases,
maintaining accountability controls, ensuring equal access for all active duty personnel assigned
to the organization, providing required maintenance of the equipment, and monitoring equipment
safety, security, and sanitation. TWCF funds are not authorized for unit fitness centers/exercise
rooms per AMCI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 6, paragraph 6.6.5.10.
   19.26.1. Group/Squadron Aerobics/Physical Fitness Instructor. See Chapter 19, paragraph
   18.24 of this publication.

support of not mission capable (NMC) AFRC and NGB unit equipped C-5, C-130, C-17, KC-10,
and KC-135 aircraft.
19.29. Chaplain Programs. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.32. for APF
funding guidance relating to direct chaplain mission requirements and chaplain-led programs to
assist Armed Forces members and families in building and maintaining a strong family structure
(P.L., 107-248, Section 8116, General Provisions).
19.30. Immunizations, Inoculations, and Atropine Injectors. Fund these requirements as
follows: (1) for PCS purposes, use DHP funds; (2) for deployments, use DHP funds if they occur
on the installation (generally in the MTF) prior to deployment and use unit O&M or TWCF
funds if they are issued to deploying personnel or organizations for future use.

                    OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS AND ISSUES

20.1. Subsistence-in Kind (SIK).
   20.1.1. SIK (57*3500, Project 562) is a centrally managed specific allotment. The command
   or installation level does not budget for this program, although some accounting and
   reporting transpires at these levels.
   20.1.2. Centralization does not relieve commands and bases from positive management of
   the SIK program to ensure you maintain the Meal Cost Allowance. Commands and bases
   have the responsibility to notify the central manager of any significant change in the absentee
   rate or number of personnel subsisted. The FMA should continue to emphasize accuracy and
   timeliness of SIK reports.
   20.1.3. Collection of Subsistence from Air Force Members Treated in Civilian Hospitals and
   VA Facilities. In accordance with AFI 41-101, Obtaining Civilian Medical and Dental Care,
   paragraph 3.5.5.1, active duty Air Force members hospitalized in civilian medical facilities or
   VA facilities for inpatient care covered by a VA and DoD sharing agreement, should incur a
   daily medical care charge for subsistence for the period of hospitalization. Charge the
   member the daily rate prescribed for military MTFs.
   20.1.4. Subsistence Payment During CONUS Field Training Exercises. DoDFMR 7000.14,
   Volume 7A, Military Pay, Policy & Procedures, Active Duty and Reserve Pay, chapter 25,
   outlines the rules for BAS entitlements during non-contingency operations. Do not provide
   military members on BAS free meals while deployed for non-contingency training purposes.
   20.1.5. Meals Ready to Eat (MRE). These are funded from the SIK account (57*3500
   Project 562). HQ AFSVA/SVOHF centrally manages all specialized rations and they must
   approve all requests for MREs and UGRs. See AFMAN 34-240, Food Service Program

20.2. Emergency and Special Program (ESP) Codes. HQ AMC/FMAO (Budget Policy and
Procedures) is the OPR for maintaining and publishing the command-level ESP coding
packages. SAF/ FMBMM is the OPR for the Air Force Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and Air Force
non-JCS ESP codes. AMC OBANs should only use the applicable codes contained in these
authorized files, which are available on the HQ AMC/FM Budget Policy Community of Practice
web site located at paragraph 1.3 of this publication. Bases/funding points may establish local
ESP codes to track programs unique to their operations.

   20.2.1. Air Force Policy for Establishing/Releasing Air Force ESP Codes for Contingency
   Operations and Natural Disasters. The following SAF/FMB processes apply:
       20.2.1.1. In the event AMC is tasked to support a major contingency or emergency that
       requires identifying and tracking costs, HQ AMC/FMA will immediately notify
       SAF/FMBOI by telephone or fax (use classified mode as necessary). The origin of the
       task, the DoD or JCS approved title (if available), and the purpose/definition of the Air
       Force mission involved. SAF/FMBOI will assess the circumstances and provide an ESP
       code as quickly as possible, if one is warranted. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4,
       paragraph 4.11.3.
       20.2.1.2. When SAF/FMB, in coordination with the joint staff and the Air Force Crisis
       Action Team (CAT), receives deployment/evacuation orders for coordination the need
       for establishing an Air Force ESP code is assessed. If there exists a need to track Air
       Force costs, SAF/FMB will instruct SAF/FMBMM to establish a ―draft‖ ESP code and
       will notify the MAJCOMs that are likely to be involved. The MAJCOMs will be asked to
       provide an appropriate cost estimate based on the force structure outlined in the
       deployment/execution order. If the order is officially released, the applicable MAJCOMs
       have the authority to use the ―draft‖ ESP code prior to receiving an official notification
       update from SAF/FMBMM.
       20.2.1.3. Under both procedures outlined above, SAF/FMBOI/FMBMM will determine
       if the Air Staff desires to track anticipated costs. This determination is based on
       compliance with Joint Staff/ OSD reporting requirements and/or the number of
       MAJCOMs impacted by the contingency/emergency. In the event SAF/FMBMM elects
       not to issue an Air Force ESP code, HQ AMC/FMA has the option to establish a
       command ESP code to monitor cost execution within AMC.
   20.2.2. AMC Reimbursable ESP Codes. Consult the current fiscal year AMC ESP code list
   on        the      HQ        AMC/FM         Budget          Policy       CoP        at
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AM-FM-BH-01             for
   command reimbursable ESP codes. The ESP code description will state if the ESP code is
   reimbursable.

20.3. AMC Test and Evaluation (T&E) Program.
   20.3.1. AMCI 99-101, Test and Evaluation (T&E), and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 14
   describe the T&E Program. The Directorate of Test and Evaluation (TE) is responsible for
   planning, programming, budgeting, and accounting for all AMC T&E resource requirements.
   AMC OBAN 65NH, RC/ CC 1J100D, accounts for the daily operating costs of HQ AMC/TE
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                      121


   and AMC OBAN 65NJ, RC/CC 1J100E, accounts for the actual test costs for tests authorized
   by HQ AMC/TE. AMC/TE costs are recorded and tracked through HQ AMC/TE-issued ESP
   codes assigned for each approved test. These ESP codes are included as part of all fund
   citations issued in support of AMC tests.
   20.3.2. On a quarterly basis, HQ AMC/TE requests HQ AMC/FMA to transfer T&E funds
   to the AMC Test and Evaluation Squadron (AMC TES) to pay TDY costs for personnel to
   participate in AMC-approved tests and for other HQ AMC/TE-approved test costs. These
   funds are sent to McGuire AFB, NJ, OBAN 65MG. The host base budgets and funds for
   support costs and 3080 procurement costs for the AMC TES. RC/CC 1J100F applies.
20.4. Management of Support Agreements.
   20.4.1. Air Force entities negotiate support agreements with other Air Force entities (when
   crossing commands), as well as DoD, or non-DoD government agencies. DoDI 4000.19, AFI
   65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements, and AFI 25-201, Support
   Agreement Procedures, all contain support agreement guidance. Coordinate all support
   agreements within the financial management and manpower activities, regardless if your unit
   is the host or tenant. While the installation supplier Support Agreement Manager (SAM) is
   the OPR for support agreements, the FM and the manpower office are integral parts of a
   successful agreements program. There are three primary types of support agreements
   common to all bases. They are:
      20.4.1.1. Intraservice Agreements. These are agreements made between two Air Force
      units belonging to different MAJCOMs, also commonly referred to as Host-Tenant
      Support Agreements.
      20.4.1.2. Interservice Agreements. These are agreements between the Air Force and
      another DoD component, e.g., the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps.
      20.4.1.3. Intragovernmental Agreements. These are agreements between the Air Force
      and other federal agencies, e.g., Defense Intelligence Agency, Federal Aviation
      Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, etc.
   20.4.2. Although the agreements listed above are similar in nature, the rules governing what
   types of support are reimbursable varies. As an example, under intraservice support
   agreements, there are very few services an Air Force host wing provides to another Air Force
   tenant unit that are reimbursable. Most services are considered common support, defined as
   routine services normally furnished by the host wing to its own assigned units. Air Force
   tenants do not reimburse for common support on Air Force installations because the host
   annually budgets and receives funding for these services.
   20.4.3. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, figure 7.1., indicates the standard elements for the
   types of services that are covered in Air Force host/tenant support agreements. Support
   requirements not covered in figure 7.1. should be addressed in the support agreement on a
   case-by-case basis and negotiated between the host and tenant. See chapter 7, paragraph 7.8.
   of AFI 65-601, Volume 1 regarding the listed exceptions for Air Force host base support
   tenants. Some of those listed Air Force tenants offer diverse services to the host base and you
   must determine the tenant services that are reimbursable by the host base. If the host base
   supports a tenant from another command and the tenant command has a unique requirement,
   then the tenant command must negotiate with the command that provides the special support.
122                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  20.4.4. There are some costs that are reimbursable between Air Force units. As a general
  rule, an Air Force tenant reimburses the host for support services received that are above and
  beyond what host routinely provides to its own units. This includes expenses incurred to
  meet a tenant‘s unique requirements, e.g., tenant uses specialized equipment to meet its
  mission requirements and the host incurs additional costs to maintain the tenant‘s equipment.
  The determination whether the tenant‘s services are unique and reimbursable depends on if
  they exceed what the host provides to its units.
  20.4.5. For interservice and intragovernmental agreements, the host wing is not funded to
  pay for much of the common support provided to non-Air Force tenants. These types of
  tenants are funded directly by their respective parent command for support provided by the
  host that is shown in DoDI 4000.19, Enclosure 6. Consequently, other DoD components and
  federal agencies are required to reimburse the host for their fair share of the costs incurred by
  the host to provide certain services.
  20.4.6. The FMAs at the AMC wings are responsible for the overall coordination of support
  agreements within the comptroller office. They accomplish the appropriate costing and
  budgeting activities and assemble the FM's input to the agreement. Additionally, they ensure
  the accomplishment of all required support agreement financial actions, review support
  agreements to validate financial information, develop appropriate unit cost factors, advise
  activities on support agreement financial matters, and act on behalf of the comptroller to
  determine funding responsibilities identified in support agreements. See AFI 25-201,
  paragraphs 2.6. and 5.4. for FM responsibilities, to include the annual budget review
  requirement for support agreements. For additional FM guidance on performing annual
  support agreement budget reviews, see SAF/FM memorandum dated 5 Jan 04, Subject:
  Annual Budget Review for Support Agreements. This guidance is now promulgated in AFI
  65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraphs 7.3.3. through 7.3.3.4. This is extremely important
  to all FMA organizations. FMAs must ensure they are properly identifying those items of
  support for which the Air Force is entitled to receive reimbursement, estimating its fair value,
  and collecting what is due.
  20.4.7. The FMA office, along with the FSO, works with the supporting DFAS field site to
  ensure provision for the appropriate accounting services, to include actual billings for the
  support services.
  20.4.8. The following is additional Air Force guidance regarding Air Force host/tenant
  funding responsibilities, when the tenant is not a host-support tenant:
      20.4.8.1. A-E Design Services. These services are common support functions and the
      host is responsible for budgeting and funding support functions common to all tenant
      organizations to the extent the tenant is not self-supporting. The only exceptions to this
      general rule are contract services for off-base tenants, when the host does not have the
      organic capability to provide the support and the design of R&M projects for allied
      support (AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph 7.6.10.).
      20.4.8.2. Contractor Installation of BPIE. The host‘s 3080 appropriation funds the
      installation costs of investment items when installation is a part of the list price of the
      equipment or covered under warranty provisions. Otherwise, the organization responsible
      for funding the associated repair or construction project or contract service funds for the
      equipment installation.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                    123


  20.4.9. Role of FMA. One of the FMA‘s most important roles in the support agreement
  process is validating the costs and the methodology used to estimate reimbursable support.
  As costing experts, the FMA office must ensure the capture of all reimbursable costs are
  accounted for in each support agreement. Although the unit support agreement monitors
  should identify and estimate reimbursable costs associated with their work centers, the FMA
  office must ensure these individuals possess the necessary skills to carry out their costing
  responsibilities. The Logistics Plans office, with the help of FMA, must ensure that unit
  support agreement monitors are completely familiar with support agreement processing and
  are able to efficiently fulfill their duties. To accomplish this, we recommend you conduct co-
  sponsored training sessions at least once a quarter. Training should cover at a minimum
  incremental costing, acceptable cost techniques, and the billing and reimbursement process.
  Also, work closely with all functional areas when formulating and revising support
  agreements. Identify the support being provided and determine if it is reimbursable or non-
  reimbursable. Keep in mind, the agreement itself is not an obligating document. To ensure
  fund availability, use a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request
  (MIPR) or other valid appropriate document to convey the required funding for the
  requested support.
     20.4.9.1. For interservice and intragovernmental agreements, all areas of support are
     subject to reimbursement; however, there must be some basis to identify support
     provided before actual reimbursement can take place. This should be identified during the
     negotiation stage. In accordance with DoDI 4000.19, change only the ―direct incremental
     cost‖ for support provided to an interservice tenant. This means that you need to show
     that your actual direct cost has or will increase due to the support provided to the tenant
     organization. There are no longer any ―mandatory‖ categories of support prorated to all
     tenants. Any and all support is open to reimbursement, provided you can show
     (measurable and identifiable) that it actually increases your direct cost. The host and
     tenant must agree, through negotiation, to the total reimbursable amount.
     20.4.9.2. New agreements for interservice or intragovernmental tenant relationships,
     where you have never provided/received support, make every effort to identify total cost,
     based on DoDI 4000.19. If the agreement is not new, revalidate the reimbursable costs
     using revised cost estimate calculations. You should annually review and revise these
     cost estimates to reflect the total cost of your reimbursement program for the coming
     year. Develop firm cost rates for the year with changes incorporated in next year‘s cost
     review cycle.
     20.4.9.3. Per AFI 25-201, chapter 3, paragraph 3.2.1., circumstances involving
     infrequent or small scale recurring support usually do not require a formal support
     agreement and the process may be waived by the installation commander if the
     administrative costs of preparing one do not justify it. An MOA or MOU, as appropriate,
     should be accomplished. For small scale recurring support, the installation support
     agreement manager should maintain a written record of details for continuity purposes.
     See attachment 1 of AFI 25-201 for a definition of a MOA/MOU.
     20.4.9.4. Support of Unified Joint Combatant Commands Residing on AMC Bases. See
     AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 7.1.1. (et seq.) for applicable funding
     guidance.
124                                                               AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


      20.4.9.5. Budget Lead-Time Away. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph
      7.7., Air Force tenants on Air Force host installations are responsible for advising the
      host of its requirements (for which the host is responsible to provide) in sufficient time to
      allow consideration during host‘s budget formulation. When the host is not afforded
      budget lead-time, the tenant should not demand funding from the host. If funds are not
      available, the host is responsible for submitting any unfunded requirements to its higher
      headquarters for funding consideration. However, the tenant command may elect to fund
      the requirement, in order to expedite the process.
  20.4.10. Support of Federal Border Clearance Agencies. These agencies (to include United
  States Customs Service, Department of Agriculture) are authorized to receive support
  without charge at AMC bases that have official aerial ports of entry. This policy is consistent
  with DoDI 5030.49, DoD Customs Inspection Program, and the Army‘s implementing
  regulation as the executive agent for DoD. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph
  7.23.4. and DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph 120201.
  20.4.11. Support for Air Force Satellite Tenants. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7,
  paragraph 7.8.1.1. for host funding responsibility. Figure 7.1. of AFI 65-601, Volume 1 does
  not apply.
  20.4.12. Support for Civilian Post Offices on Air Force Bases. AMC bases will provide
  facilities for civilian post offices on its installation that is solely in support of the unit‘s (host
  wing) mission. The post office will only reimburse AMC host installations for utilities and
  local telephone services. See AFI 25-201, attachment 6, paragraph A6.4.
  20.4.13. Support for Community/Regulated Service Organizations on Air Force Bases.
  These organizations (e.g., Boy/Girl Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, American Red Cross,) are not
  charged for support services provided by the host installation. Regulated Service
  Organizations (e.g., banks and credit unions) are charged for base support services in
  accordance with existing regulations or contracts. Support agreements are not required for
  Regulated Service Organizations. See AFI 25-201, Attachment 6, paragraph A6.1.
  20.4.14. Official Mail/Postage.
      20.4.14.1. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph 7.8.10. provides guidance on
      paying for official mail, as follows:
          20.4.14.1.1. All organizations on an Air Force installation (host or tenant) will pay
          for their postage costs.
          20.4.14.1.2. The host base has the option to establish a limit below which it is not
          cost effective to recoup reimbursement for postage fees.
      20.4.14.2. Do not use APF to mail care or morale packages to deployed individuals or
      units. DoD 4525.8-M, DoD Official Mail Manual, chapter 1, paragraph C1.4.9., prohibits
      APF to pay for these requirements. Additionally, paragraph C1.4.19. prohibits mailing
      matter donated by individuals for donation to other individuals or charitable
      organizations, using APF. NOTE: Use of a unit address as the return address does not
      legitimize the mailing of personal matter, to include care/ morale packages and material
      donated to charitable organizations or individuals. Units should not attempt to circumvent
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        125


       this policy by including personal items that are not exclusively the business of the U.S.
       Government in official mail addressed to units.
   20.4.15. Strategic/Non-Strategic MOAs for Goods and Services provided by the Wing
   Services Organization. See Chapter 23, paragraph 23.7 of this publication.
20.5. Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR).
   20.5.1. Issue MIPRs pursuant to the Economy Act (see Chapter 5, paragraph 5.5. of this
   publication for exception). Therefore, reduce obligations recorded against Economy Act
   MIPRs on the books of the ordering agency at the end of the period for the authorized
   appropriation, to the extent the receiving agency has not incurred obligations under the MIPR
   (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 7, paragraph 7.16.4. and DFAS-DE interim guidance,
   Accounting for Obligations). See also AFI 65-116, Air Force Purchases Using Military
   Interdepartmental Purchas Requests (MIPRs) for Air Force guidance and procedures for
   processing MIPRs.
   20.5.2. When issuing funds to other Air Force, ANG, or AFRC agencies, you may use a
   MIPR in lieu of an AF Form 616. The use of a MIPR for requirements to these agencies
   allows for the transaction to be processed into OPAC, which avoids the by-others system.
   Funding will be obligated/expensed in a more efficient manner and payments are posted in a
   matter of days instead of months. This greatly benefits the DFAS field site and the
   organization providing the funds.
20.6. Base Veterinary Clinics. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.43., the
Department of the Army Veterinary Service is considered an integral part of the local Air Force
medical staff and, as such, is not an interservice tenant on Air Force bases. Therefore, the Army
does not reimburse the base for required host support provided to the veterinary clinic; regard it
in the same manner as any host support for the base Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). NOTE:
See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.23.2. regarding the application of civil
engineering and communications support for veterinary services.
20.7. Medical Insurance Billings and Reimbursements in Air Force Medical Treatment
Facilities (MTFs)--Third Party Collection (TPC) Program. 10 U.S.C., Section 1095, Health
Care Services Incurred on Behalf of Covered Beneficiaries: Collection From Third-Party Payers
(as amended by Public Law 99-272), directs military MTFs to collect from third party insurance
carriers the medical services hospital costs for retirees and all categories of dependents with
private health insurance. All retiree and dependent inpatients should be questioned about
availability of health insurance, have insurance certifications accomplished, and certifications
filed in each inpatient's clinical record. The TPC program includes outpatient services,
automobile liability, and no-fault insurance policies as well as inpatient hospital care, ambulatory
procedure visits, outpatient visits, Cooperative and Supplemental Care programs, ancillary
services ordered by outside providers, hyperbaric medicine, immunizations, dental care, ground
and air ambulance services, automobile liability, and no-fault insurance policies.
20.8. Medical Third Party Liability Notification. In accordance with AFI 41-120, Medical
Resource Operations, section E, paragraph 26.1., the military MTF is required to notify the base
staff judge advocate when treating patients for injury or disease caused by a third person under
circumstances creating a potential liability, or financial responsibility, for Air Force provided
medical and dental care.
 126                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


20.9. Liquid Substitutes, Sports Beverages, and Sunscreen. The Air Force Surgeon General
has determined that salt tablets should no longer be used by Air Force members (military and
civilian) to replace body salts and minerals lost through heavy perspiration. Liquid substitutes
and sports beverages in lieu of salt tablets may be purchased from organizational (O&M or
TWCF, as applicable) funds provided that competent medical authority has determined, in
writing, that the need exists.
20.10. Air Navigation and Overflight Fees.
   20.10.1. In accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.49. and State
   Department policy, all United States Government aircraft are exempt and deemed ―state
   aircraft.‖ These aircraft are exempt for air navigation and overflight fees charges by foreign
   governments, unless allowed under specific treaty provisions between the United States and a
   foreign government. A primary example is certain arms control treaties that apply to the
   movement of On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA) teams by organic airlift aircraft into the
   former Soviet Union states. An existing treaty between the United States government and the
   Agency for the Safety of Air Navigation in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA) which
   allowed for payment of these fees expired effective 1 Nov 97 and was not renewed, at the
   request of the State Department.
   20.10.2. Except for any provision contained in weapons compliance treaties, air navigation
   and overflight fees should not be paid under normal circumstances. However, if AMC
   aircraft commanders are faced with circumstances in a foreign country whereby payment of
   these fees is contingent upon the aircraft‘s ability to depart the country to continue the
   mission, payment is allowed and a protest should be filed with the residing United States
   Embassy. AMC aircrews should follow the procedures contained in the DoD Foreign
   Clearance Guide, located in the forward part of each regional booklet, Section I, paragraph
   A5 or A6, as appropriate.
   20.10.3. ASECNA bills for overflight fees prior to 1 Nov 97 but received afterwards will
   continue to be honored. ASECNA overflight charges for TWCF aircraft pertaining to
   occurrences in FY97 or prior but received in FY98 or later will be paid with current year
   expense authority unless accruals were previously established in the accounting system for
   the fiscal year of occurrence.
20.11. Landing and Parking Fees. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.50.,
these charges may be assessed against AMC aircraft by commercial airports at certain foreign
countries. The home station of the aircraft is responsible for payment. SF 44 or AIR Card
procedures should be used to charge these fees, where applicable. In accordance with
SECSTATE guidance, do not pay these fees for any AMC aircraft that land at foreign airports
that are designated as military airfields or foreign air bases. See paragraph 20.10.2 above for
procedures on paying landing and parking fees at foreign military airfields/ air bases if forced to
do so by the foreign government.
20.12. Border Clearances. Whenever personnel from the Bureau of Customs, the Department
of Agriculture, the Department of Public Health Services, and the Department of Immigration
and Naturalization Service need to inspect AMC aircraft outside of their normal duty hours,
AMC reimburses for the cost of their overtime, Sunday, and holiday pay (AFI 65-601, Volume
1, chapter 7, paragraph 7.23.4. and DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph
120201.). Reimbursement of overtime charges performed at TWCF-funded bases will be
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        127


charged to local TWCF funds, using EEIC 55912. The cost of AMC aircraft inspections at non-
TWCF bases and commercial airports are the responsibility of the aircraft‘s home station. Use
SF 44 to process border clearance fees imposed on AMC TWCF aircraft at non-TWCF locations.
20.13. GPC Program (Formerly IMPAC). AFI 64-117 provides policy on use of the Air
Force GPC, to include authorized and unauthorized purchases (chapter 2). The maximum
amount per single micro purchase limit is set at $2,500. However, you may now exceed the
$2,500 single limit up to and including $25,000 if purchasing from GSA Schedule, Federal
Supply Schedule, Desktop V or VA contract, or any other pre-priced contract already in
existence and $100,000 if purchasing from DAPS.
20.14. Support of Service Members on Delayed AMC Organic Aircraft. AMCI 65-602,
chapter 6, paragraph 6.8., provides funding policy guidance for the support of service members,
in a group travel status, who are transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a TWCF mission
which incurs an unscheduled delay, due to weather or maintenance problems. Use AMC
command ESP code CH (Charlie Hotel) to track and record these costs in the accounting system.
20.15. Contingency Operations.
   20.15.1. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the ensuing independence of the former Soviet
   Union states and Soviet-bloc European countries, AMC has been heavily involved in world
   wide contingency operations regarding humanitarian or disaster relief, noncombatant
   evacuation, and deploying peacekeeping forces. Depending upon the size, nature, and
   number of contingencies involved in a given fiscal year, contingency operations could easily
   be the largest command program, if not one of the largest, to include the civilian pay and the
   flying hour program. Congress ultimately provides funding for these operations after the fact,
   with the passage of the O&M supplemental funding bills and subsequent allocation to
   SAF/FM.
   20.15.2. The O&M contingency expense reports are the basis for supplemental funding
   provided by SAF/FM. This data comes from reports received from the different commands‘
   FMs, predicated on the reports they receive from their bases or extracted from the accounting
   database. HQ AMC/FMA provides periodic O&M contingency obligation reports to
   SAF/FM, based on the data extrapolated from the current accounting database. These reports
   identify actual obligations as well as projected net additive costs. Net additive costs are those
   additional costs to an appropriation that would not incur if the contingency operations had
   not occurred. SAF/FMB issues ESP codes to track and identify these costs. HQ AMC issues
   and maintains the lists of Air Force and command applicable ESP codes for reimbursable
   O&M contingency operations, available on the HQ AMC/FM web site listed in paragraph
   1.3 of this publication.
   20.15.3. Net additive contingency costs can quickly place a cash flow burden on an
   installation‘s budget execution if program management is not effective. AMC reimburses all
   properly identified contingency obligations (commitments are not reimbursed) up to the level
   of funding received from the Air Staff. Since command reimbursements tie directly to
   obligations, timely and accurate coding and reporting by bases is extremely important for full
   reimbursement. It is in the base‘s best interest to quickly move requirements from the
   commitment stage to the obligation stage. However, you must maintain the proper coding of
   these costs. To aid in the timely identification of costs for reimbursement, be sure to identify
   to correct unit line number (ULN) upfront when providing the requirement for the mission.
 128                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   20.15.4. Contingency operations costs have visibility at the congressional level and inquiries
   can come from various sources on a wide variety of subjects. Bases can expect high levels of
   scrutiny by the command, the Air Staff, the Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA), and the
   General Accounting Office (GAO), to include detailed justifications on projected
   expenditures.
   20.15.5. Contingency Operations Applicable to TWCF. Charge all direct TWCF related
   costs of contingency operations to the appropriate base or headquarters level TWCF OBAN
   account. Travel/per diem costs of TWCF-coded personnel will be charged to the TWCF
   funding citation of their applicable units of assignment, IAWAFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter
   10, paragraph 10.2.1. Use the applicable contingency-assigned ESP code to accurately
   capture costs. HQ AMC/FMA will seek additional TWCF expense authority from
   USTRANSCOM/TCJ8 to cover contingency costs if the review of each base‘s (and the
   headquarters) accounting records supports and justifies an increase in funding. See AMCI
   65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.10., for additional guidance on TWCF contingency operations
   support.
20.16. Official Representation Funds (ORF).
   20.16.1. The ORF program (PE 91515F), sometimes referred to as the commander‘s
   contingency fund, allows wing level commanders and other authorized commanders to
   extend official courtesies to certain officials and dignitaries of the United States and foreign
   countries, as prescribed in AFI 65-603. Conduct entertainment on a modest basis that
   complies with socially acceptable standards of American society and jointly serves the
   objectives of our government and the interest of the taxpayer. Official entertainment costs
   can include meals, receptions, refreshments, and mementos. These funds are extremely
   limited and all expenditures receive high visibility and scrutiny, to include HQ AMC/FM,
   HQ AMC/CV/CC, and HAF/RM.
   20.16.2. Advance requests to wing commanders for these funds must justify their use and
   itemize proposed expenditures, identify the category of entertainment, include a proposed
   guest list with the position or title of invitees, indicate DoD to non-DoD guest ratios, and the
   date of the event. AFI 65-603 imposes very stringent controls on this program. Bases should
   apply extreme caution when expending ORF funds. When a unit cannot use ORF or their
   regular O&M funds for a specific function, then Special, Morale, and Welfare Funds
   (SM&W) is the next alternative. See Chapter 23, paragraph 23.3. of this publication for
   discussion on SM&W funds.
   20.16.3. All AMC bases and funding points that are issued ORF funds must submit their
   draft quarterly RCS: SAF-FM(Q)7113, (AF Form 134, Report of Contingency Expenditures),
   to the ORF analyst at HQ AMC/FMAO, 402 Scott Drive, Unit 1K1, Scott AFB, IL 62225-
   5311, no later that the 5th workday after the end of the reporting period (December, March,
   June, and September), to include copies of all backup documentation supporting the
   transactions. Negative replies are required. The total dollar amount of the items reflected on
   the report should match only what is shown for balance ID ―E‖ (accrued expenditures paid)
   in the Command Resources Information System (CRIS) for the quarter. The official signed
   ORF report (by the base wing commander (for AMC bases) or authorized organizational
   commander (e.g., 89 AW, USAF EC, 18 AF)) is due to the HQ AMC/FMAO ORF analyst by
   the 20th of the month following the end of the reporting period. NOTE: Items not paid by
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                      129


   the end of the fiscal year but which are paid in the following quarter of the new fiscal year
   will require a separate report from those items that are ordered and paid in the new quarter of
   the fiscal year.
20.17. Treaty Inspection Teams. The Air Force must comply with international treaties and
arms control related agreements made by the United States government. However, there are no
treaty provisions that require the Air Force agencies to purchase small token gifts for visiting
treaty inspection teams at the conclusion of the treaty inspections. These ―gifts‖ are not a
necessary expense for the purpose of arms control and you must not use unit funds for that
purpose. The host or inspected party will provide, or arrange for the provision of meals, lodging,
work space, transportation, and as necessary, medical and other urgent services for the
inspectors, and aircrew members of the inspecting party (PE 35145 funds). However, per AFI
65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.28.1.7., you may use APF to fund light food and
refreshments at inspection briefings. You may use ORF to fund for mementos provided the
inspection visit meets the guidelines established in AFI 65-603.
20.18. Licenses and Certificates/Professional Credentials.
   20.18.1. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.47., in conjunction with Comptroller
   General (CG) Decision B-252467 allows the use of APF to pay for licenses or certificates for
   military personnel in instances where federal law compels Air Force members to comply
   with state and local regulations requiring licenses or certificates.
   20.18.2. This ruling does not apply to civilian employees of the Air Force, supported by
   several CG decisions referenced in the GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law,
   Volume I, chapter 4, pages 4-210 and 4-211 (Personnel Qualification Expense) and page 4-
   256 (Occupational License Fees). Noted exceptions to this rule are:
       20.18.2.1. Civilian employees TDY for an extended time to a foreign country that
       require a license to operate a motor vehicle, even though it was not one of the employees‘
       duties but was a less expensive alternative to hiring additional personnel.
       20.18.2.2. Civilian employees who are required to serve as a notary public in the
       performance of their Air Force duties.
   20.18.3. The CG decision goes further with regard to funding of professional licenses and
   certificates of Air Force members, stating: ―We note, however, that appropriated funds are
   not available to meet the licensing requirement‘s of professional personnel such as teachers,
   accountants, engineers, lawyers, doctors, and nurses. These individuals are fully aware of the
   licensing requirements of their professions from the time they begin their professional
   education, and of the fact that society expects them to fully qualify themselves for the
   performance of their chosen professions.‖
   20.18.4. It appears at first glance there is conflicting guidance within the framework of the
   CG decision regarding its application to Air Force members (paragraphs 20.18.1 and
   20.18.3 above). However, the focus of the decision is to those Air Force members who are
   performing a particular job that requires a license or certificate, unaware they need to obtain
   a license or certificate to perform this job, upon joining the Air Force.
   20.18.5. Professional Credentials for Federal Civilian Employees. Per HQ USAF/DP
   memorandum dated 28 Mar 03, Subject: Policy Memorandum – Payment of Expenses to
 130                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   Obtain Professional Credentials (Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civilian Personnel
   Policy) Memo, 17 Aug 02, Payment of Expenses to Obtain Professional Credentials),
   authorizes agencies to pay expenses for civilian employees to obtain and renew professional
   credentials, including expenses for professional accreditation, state/municipally-imposed
   professional licenses, professional certifications, and examinations to obtain such credentials.
   This was authorized by Section 1112 of the FY02 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L.
   107-107). See the referenced memorandum for additional guidance. A copy of this guidance
   is    directly    available     on      the     AMC/FM        Budget      Policy     CoP      at
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AM-FM-BH-01, located
   under ―Budget Policy Memos and Other Files.‖
20.19. The Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA).
   20.19.1. The FY97 DoD Authorizations Act (Public Law 104-201), contains substantial
   amendments to 42 U.S.C., Section 2651, the first being the expansion of its application and
   increasing the types of costs recoverable, in cases where the United States is a third party
   beneficiary to insurance contracts in no-fault states (42 U.S.C., Section 2651(c)(1)). The
   assertion of an FMCRA claim in no-fault states is a two-step process, as follows:
       20.19.1.1. Claims personnel must determine that tortious conduct exists under the
       particular state‘s general tort law.
       20.19.1.2. If tortious conduct does exist, an FMCRA claim against the insurance
       company as a third party beneficiary is a possibility.
   20.19.2. The second revision to the above statute is the lost wages of active duty military
   members as a recoverable cost. Claims personnel need to determine from the service member
   how many days he or she was unable to work. A copy of a current leave and earning
   statement will establish the basic pay, special pay, and incentive pay in determining the
   amount of lost wages recoverable by the United States (42 U.S.C., Section 2651(g)(3)).
   20.19.3. Since MTFs usually provide for the medical care for active duty members, most
   hospital recovery claims fall under the Coordination of Benefits (COB) statute. However,
   COB does not allow for the recoupment of lost wages. If the incident involves tortious
   conduct and an active duty member, claims personnel will also include an FMCRA claim for
   lost wages in addition to the COB claim.
   20.19.4. The third revision involves the deposit of successful recoveries for lost wages into
   the appropriation account supporting the operations of the command, activity, or unit of
   assignment of the injured service member (42 U.S.C., Section 2651(f)(2)). Record collections
   to the unit RC/CC as a reimbursement using sales code 99 and EEIC 23101, MILPERS
   Personal Injury Collections. O&M-funded units may spend these collections at its discretion,
   within the legal limitations of the appropriation. For TWCF units, however, consider these
   collections the same as revenues earned from miscellaneous sales of services (AMCI 65-602,
   chapter 3, paragraph 3.2.3.) except that the recording procedures described above will apply.
   Since the TWCF is a Working Capital Fund operation, all revenue reimbursements earned
   and deposited, regardless of the source, offset the overall operating expenses at the command
   level, thereby directly influencing the TWCF Net Operating Results (NOR).
   20.19.5. The fourth revision (42 U.S.C., Section 2651(f)(1)) parallels existing provisions in
   the COB statute regarding the deposit of successful recoveries based on treatment in a
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        131


   military hospital or clinic. Under the new FMCRA changes, deposit any amounts recovered
   for medical care furnished by a (MTF) in the operations account of that MTF. Collection
   procedures in paragraph 20.19.4 above apply.
   20.19.6. The authority to collect under these revisions applies to expenses incurred on or
   after the effective date of the FY97 DoD Authorization Act (23 Sep 96). The date of the
   incident causing the injury is irrelevant. Claims examiners need to ascertain the date of
   medical treatment or payment and the dates an active duty member was unavailable for duty
   to determine the total amount recoverable from the insurance company.
20.20. Availability of Samples, Drawings, Information Equipment, Materials, and Certain
Services. The FY94 Authorization Act (P.L. 103-160), codified in 10 U.S.C., Section 2539,
grants the following authority for the military departments, providing it is in the best interest of
National Defense:
   20.20.1. Sell rent, lend, or give samples, drawings, and manufacturing or other information
   (subject to the rights of third parties) to any person or entity.
   20.20.2. Sell, rent, or lend government equipment or materials to any person or entity under
   the following conditions:
       20.20.2.1. Used in independent research and development programs, subject to the
       conditions that the equipment or material is used exclusively for such research or
       development.
       20.20.2.2. Used in the demonstration to a friendly foreign government.
       20.20.2.3. Make available to any person or entity, at an appropriate fee, the service of
       any government laboratory, center, range, or other testing facility for the testing of
       materials, equipment, models, computer software, and other items. Fees for these services
       may not exceed the amount necessary to recoup the direct and indirect costs involved,
       such as direct costs of utilities, contractor support, and salaries of personnel incurred by
       the United States to provide for the testing. Credit such fees to the appropriations or other
       funds of the activity making such services available.
   20.20.3. DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 11A, chapter 14, provides regulatory guidance on this
   issue.
   20.20.4. OSD (AT&T) delegated the authority to the acquisition executives of the military
   departments, directors of defense agencies, and directors or commanders of government
   laboratories, centers or other facilities for the testing of these items, to implement this
   guidance subject to the direction or control by a higher office.
20.21. Funding Policy for Quality of Life Enhancement, Defense Account (QOL,DA).
   20.21.1. In accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.53., you cannot
   supplement OSD appropriations for QOL,DA with Air Force O&M 3400 funds, for the
   purpose of commingling them on the same contract to cover price changes, within scope
   changes, or any other cost increases. The applicable OSD appropriations include, but are not
   necessarily limited to the following: Air Force Relocation Assistance Program (RAP),
   Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Lease of DoD Assets, Transfer or Disposal of Real
   Property, DoD Overseas Military Facility Investment Recovery Account - Defense, Legacy
   Program, and Federal Energy Management Program.
 132                                                           AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   20.21.2. The intent of OSD‘s guidance is not to preclude the use of Air Force O&M 3400
   funds to support these OSD-funded programs for civilian pay, supplies, and other
   miscellaneous purchases that do not involve the mixing of the two funding sources on one
   contract. In AMC, supplementing OSD appropriations with O&M funds is applicable
   primarily to the RAP (FC 2S) and TAP (FC 2T) programs.
20.22. NOTE: Effective FY07 (1 Oct 06) base claims are now centrally processed through the
Air Force Claims Service Center (AFCSC).
   20.22.1. Damage Claims Between Federal Agencies. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP,
   paragraphs 4.78.1. through 4.78.4. for policy guidance. Refer to the GAO: Principles of
   Federal Appropriations Law, Volume III, chapter 12, section D, pages 12-161 through 12-
   164, for additional information on this subject.
   20.22.2. Claims Payable From O&M Funds. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10,
   paragraph 10.63., the following claims are payable from O&M 3400 funds under EEIC 672
   (with appropriate shred):
       20.22.2.1. Damage to personal property incurred during shipment or storage under
       contract with civilian carriers or warehouses.
       20.22.2.2. Funds erroneously collected and repaid to military members, civilian
       personnel, or to states, territories, and the District of Columbia, or members of National
       Guard units, as determined by appropriate authority.
       20.22.2.3. Payments for damages to persons or property caused by DoD personnel or
       activities.
   20.22.3. (DELETED)
   20.22.4. Collect and record carrier recoveries for damages to personal property of Air Force
   members (military or civilian) in the accounting system as refunds and not reimbursements,
   under AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 5, paragraph 5.12.
   20.22.5. Claims not Payable from O&M Funds. The following are examples of claims that
   are not payable from your O&M 3400 funds:
       20.22.5.1. Claims arising from the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA), as
       these are payable from a central fund of the United States Treasury known as the
       Employees Compensation Fund.
       20.22.5.2. Claims filed as a result of local contract dispute settlements. Charge to the
       appropriation cited on the original contract unless the application of the Bona Fide Need
       Rule indicates otherwise. However, in all cases of settlements involving TWCF contracts
       use current year TWCF funds.
       20.22.5.3. Administrative claims (e.g., ―reasonable‖ attorney fees, court reporters, etc.)
       as a result of local arbitration decisions based on grievances/discrimination complaints
       filed by federal employees, e.g., claims arising out of Equal Employment Opportunity
       (EEO), wrongful termination, lack of promotion, or other Merit Service Protection Board
       (MSPB)-related settlements. These claims are payable from unit O&M funds of the
       employee who filed the complaint, provided the employee prevails in the case (5 U.S.C.,
       Section 7701, GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume I, chapter 4, page
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                     133


     4-57). However, if a federal court adjudicates the claim, paragraph 20.22.5.4 below
     applies. See DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph 120228., for
     additional guidance for payments on these types of claims.
     20.22.5.4. Claims adjudicated in a federal court that renders a judgment against the
     United States. Payments for these judgments originate from the Judgment Fund (31
     U.S.C., Section 1304), administered by the General Accounting Office. The Judgment
     Fund is not available for claims settled at the administrative level or awards by
     administrative tribunals. Examples include:
         20.22.5.4.1. Claims payable in excess of $2,500 filed under the Federal Tort Claims
         Act (28 U.S.C., Section 1346(b) and 28 U.S.C., Sections 2671-2680).
         20.22.5.4.2. Initial payment of all claims filed and payable under the Contract
         Disputes Act. However, 41 U.S.C., Section 612 governs the payment of these claims,
         which provides for the available agency appropriation used to award the contract.
         Therefore, the agency appropriation on the contract current at the time of the award or
         judgment reimburses the judgment appropriation. If the agency has insufficient funds
         available for reimbursement at that time, under the statute it may seek additional
         appropriations. This does not have to be a specific line item appropriation. See
         DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 3 chapter 8, paragraph 080304.F. (et seqq.) for guidance
         on reimbursing the judgment appropriation.
         20.22.5.4.3. Inverse condemnation claims in excess of $10,000.
         20.22.5.4.4. Claims payable in excess of $100,000 filed under the Military Claims
         Act (10 U.S.C., Section 2733) and the Foreign Claims Act (10 U.S.C., Section
         2733(b)(4)).
         20.22.5.4.5. All claims filed and payable under the Small Claims Act (31 U.S.C.,
         Section 3723).
         20.22.5.4.6. Tort claims arising in foreign countries in excess of $2,500. NOTE:
         Those claims $2,500 or less are paid only from those agency appropriations having
         specific authority by law to settle tort claims in foreign countries.
         20.22.5.4.7. Use the same appropriation that was made available for the original
         project to reimburse the Judgment Fund. If the original appropriation has been
         canceled (expired beyond 5 years), use the respective current year funds. Consult
         DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 3, chapter 8, paragraph 080304.F. for additional
         guidance concerning payments for claims involving the Judgment Fund.
  20.22.6. Interest Penalty Payment on Contractor Claims. Payment of interest owed on
  contractor claims is based on 41 U.S.C., Section 611, chapter 9. Interest on amounts due to
  contractors on claims are paid to the contractor from the date the contracting office receives
  the claim pursuant to Section 605(a) of 41 U.S.C. 611 from the contractor until payment is
  made. Interest is chargeable to the available appropriation at the time it begins to accrue and
  not necessarily to the appropriation that funded the original contract. To the extent the
  available appropriation is not available to fund all or a portion of the interest owed, current
  year funds must be used to pay the accrued interest.
 134                                                              AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   20.22.7. Damage Resulting from Interagency Loans of Personal Property. This circumstance
   is basically the same as paragraph 20.22.1 above. See GAO: Principles of Federal
   Appropriation Law, Volume III, chapter 12, section D, pages 12-164 through 12-168, for
   applicable guidance.
   20.22.8. Refer any questions concerning the appropriate application of funds to pay a
   particular claim not addressed above to your local JAG office for proper disposition.
   20.22.9. Claims for the U.S. Government. DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 18, and
   GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriation Law, Volume III, chapter 13, discusses contractor
   debt collection procedures for the U.S. Government. Refer any circumstances involving
   claims against contractors, vendors, and other business entities consistent with the Federal
   Acquisition Regulation and the DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to your
   local JAG office for resolution.
   20.22.10. See 10 U.S.C., Section 3702 on the authority to settle claims of, or against the U.S.
   Government.
20.23. Interest Penalty Charges. Most of the following guidance regarding this issue is also
located in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.21.
   20.23.1. All federal departments and agencies must comply with the Prompt Payment Act
   (P.L. 97-177 (codified in 31 U.S.C., Section 3902) and 5 C.F.R., Part 1315, Prompt
   Payment) and pay interest penalty charges from their existing appropriations. FSOs are
   responsible for funding interest penalty charges regardless of the appropriation or activity
   (host or tenant) that caused the late payment.
   20.23.2. For AMC, the only appropriation available to finance interest penalty charges is Air
   Force O&M 3400. However, on a case-by-case exception, host installations may charge these
   costs to tenant O&M funds if there is clear evidence that the tenant was directly responsible
   for the interest penalty. Both the host and tenant must agree prior to charging the tenant‘s
   funds. This agreement must be in writing and approved by the installation comptroller and
   the commander of the tenant organization.
   20.23.3. In accordance with the GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume
   III, chapter 12, page 12-236, 1st paragraph, interest payments under the Prompt Payment Act
   are chargeable to the fiscal year or years in which the interest liability accrued. If a contractor
   submits a bill for a claim on a prior year-funded contract and the bill was received in the
   current year, pay any interest accrued from current year funds, even though prior year funds
   on the contract paid the disputed amount for which the contractor billed. For example, the
   contractor submits a bill against the outstanding prior year contract in June 2007 (FY07), and
   not paid until December 2007 (FY08). The interest accrues in both fiscal years and the total
   interest penalty authorized for payment is split between FY05 and FY05 accordingly,
   assuming there was no dispute over the amount billed. Interest does not begin to accrue on a
   contractor‘s invoice if a dispute between the government and the contractor exists over the
   amount of payment or other issues concerning contract compliance until resolution of the
   dispute is finally settled.
   20.23.4. For NAF paying offices and activities, charge the interest penalty to NAF funds.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       135


   20.23.5. The agency of the non-Air Force paying offices that administer AMC Air Force
   contracts are responsible to pay interest penalty charges incurred as a result of late payments
   to the contractor without subsequent recovery or reimbursement from the AMC unit who
   originally funded the contract.
   20.23.6. For Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts, see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4,
   paragraph 4.21.5. NOTE: The FMS fund cite for interest payments changes every year to
   some degree; recommend contacting DFAS-DE/AYC for the appropriate FMS interest
   penalty fund cite.
   20.23.7. Refer to DFAS-BSSD/DE Standard Vendor Pay Guide - Desktop Guide for Vendor
   Payment Processing (April 2003). Section IV, for specific accounting instructions.
   20.23.8. Interest Payable Under Contractor Claims. See paragraph 20.22.6 of this
   publication for guidance concerning the payment of interest with regard to contractor claims.
20.24. Imprest Funds. Per DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 5, Disbursing Policy and Procedures,
chapter 2, paragraph 020902, do not use imprest funds for unclassified programs. Authorized
exceptions to this policy are for contingency and classified operations. Submit any requests for
deviation from, or exceptions to, this policy through command channels and SAF/FM to the
Director, Financial Commerce, and OUSD(C). Requests must contain adequate justification and
demonstrate that the GPC, Government-Wide Travel Card, or other reasonable alternatives are
not feasible for the specific circumstances.
20.25. Private Organizations (POs). These are self-sustaining interest groups, established by
personnel acting outside the scope of any official position they may have in the federal
government. POs are not integral parts of the military service or federal entities, nor are they
NAFIs, as defined in AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), chapter 1. POs do not
receive sovereign immunities and privileges given to NAFIs or the Air Force. They operate on
Air Force installations with the written consent of the installation commander. POs must be self-
sustaining and will not receive any direct financial assistance from APF or NAFI in the form of
contributions, dividends, or donation of funds or other assets, unless directed otherwise by
specific AFIs pertaining to their operation. For additional guidance on POs, refer to AFI 34-223,
Private Organization (PO) Program, and AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP, paragraph 4.67. (et
seqq).
20.26. Memorialization. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP, paragraph 4.66. (et seqq) for
funding guidance on costs pertaining to memorialization.
20.27. Contest Entry Fees and Prizes/Awards. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP,
paragraph 4.64. (et seqq) for related funding guidance.
20.28. Administrative Expenses Related to Certain Real Property Transactions. In
accordance with 10 U.S.C., Section 2695 military departments may accept amounts provided by
an individual or entity to cover administrative expenses (TDY, military and civilian pay,
materials, supplies) incurred by the department in conjunction with entering into certain real
property transactions with a non-federal person or entity. This includes (1) the exchange of real
property, (2) the grant of an easement over, in, or upon real property of the United States, or (3)
the lease or license of real property of the United States. Amounts collected shall be credited to
the appropriation, fund, or account from which the expenses were paid, and shall be available for
the same limitations as the funds from which originally paid.

20.29. Insurance.
   20.29.1. The Federal Government is essentially a self-insurer in certain important areas,
   primarily loss or damage to government property and the liability of government employees
   insofar as the government is legally responsible or would ultimately bear the loss. In the
   absence of specific statutory authority to the contrary, appropriated funds are not available
   for the purchase of insurance to cover loss or damage to government property or the liability
   of government employees (CompGen Decision B-158766, 3 February 77). Noted non-
   statutory exceptions to the self-insurance rule are as follows (CompGen Decision B-151876,
   24 April 64):
       20.29.1.1. Where the economy sought by self-insurance would be defeated.
       20.29.1.2. Where sound business practice indicates that a savings can be effected.
       20.29.1.3. Where services or benefits not otherwise available can be obtained by
       purchasing insurance.
   20.29.2. The Comptroller General has determined that the self-insurance rule does not apply
   to privately-owned property temporarily entrusted to the government. However, insurance
   may be purchased on loaned private property only when the owner requires insurance
   coverage as a part of the transaction. If the owner does not require insurance, private
   insurance is not a necessary expense and the government should self-insure.
   20.29.3. Property Owned by Government Contractors. A contractor will normally purchase a
   variety of insurance as a matter of sound business practice. The insurance premiums are a
   part of the contractor‘s overhead and will be reflected in its bid price, therefore, the
   government is paying at least a part of the insurance cost indirectly. Since the risks covered
   are not the risks of the government, there is no objection to this ―indirect payment‖ nor, if
   administratively determined to be necessary, to the inclusion of an insurance stipulation in
   the contract. In the case of lease-purchase agreements where the government holds an
   equitable title, the self-insurance rule applies (35 CompGen Decision 391 & 393).
   20.29.4. The Federal Employees‘ Health Benefits Program and the Federal Employees‘
   Group Life Insurance are primary examples of authorized instances where the government
   may purchase insurance.
   20.29.5. For additional information on the self-insurance rule, consult the GAO: Principles
   of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume I, chapter 4, section 10. If you are uncertain about
   using APF to pay for insurance premiums, consult with your local JAG office for a legal
   opinion.
   20.29.6. War Risk Insurance. 10 U.S.C., Section 9514 requires prompt payment to reimburse
   the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for loss of commercial aircraft covered by
   defense-related aviation insurance. SECDEF shall indemnify the Secretary of Transportation
   for the amount of the loss consistent with the indemnification agreement between the two
   Secretaries that underlies such insurance. The SECDEF will identify the source of the
   available appropriated (O&M) funds for these circumstances. Since these are DoD
   obligations, there is no need for cross indemnifying agreements between the Services
   needing this insurance for their shipments; all Service funds are at risk in the event of loss.
   The reimbursement process would be carried out at Air Force level or higher unless the Air
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                        137


   Force specifically provides HQ AMC the funds for this purpose and directs HQ AMC to
   reimburse the FAA.
20.30. Payment of State and Local Taxes. Per GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriation
Law, Volume 1, chapter 4, section 15, Air Force agencies are generally exempt from paying state
and local taxes assessed on goods and services by commercial vendors. In these cases, the buyer,
not the seller, is responsible for payment of the tax (referred to as a vendor tax). However, if the
seller is obligated to pay the tax (referred to as a vendee tax), Air Force agencies will reimburse
the seller for the total cost, to include the tax. (See also AMCS1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
paragraph 4.57.)
20.31. Other Items of Interest. You may use APFs (O&M 3400 funds) for the following
circumstances listed below unless other funding is directed. Unless authorized by AMCI 65-602,
do not use TWCF funds for these purposes (see chapter 6, paragraph 6.6. of AMCI 65-602 for
items excluded from TWCF funding).
   20.31.1. Purchase of seasonal decorations for holiday observances. APFs are authorized on a
   case-by-case basis. All base personnel must be able to benefit from their use, e.g., a
   decorated building, base Christmas tree, or a decorated foyer of a government building. Per
   SAF/FMBM message 110941Z Dec 02, APFs are now authorized to purchase Thanksgiving
   and Christmas decorations for the main dining facility of an Air Force installation. Excluded
   from APFs are decorations for the interior of government offices or personal use and the
   purchase or mailing of greeting cards. The approved decorations must not be religious in
   character. (AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.26.2.).
       20.31.1.1. There is no specific guidance that addresses decorations for national holidays.
       It is a generally accepted practice that patriotic national holidays (e.g., 4th of July,
       Memorial Day, Veterans Day) would allow for appropriate and tasteful decorations
       within prudent fiscal spending limits. The purchase of a wreath by an Air Force
       installation to remember or celebrate a national patriotic event is an authorized APF
       purchase (AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.27.4.). Within reason,
       decorations for these holidays are appropriate and authorized for common access
       facilities as described in paragraph 20.31.1 above.
       20.31.1.2. Do not use APF to purchase decorations relating to birthdays or ―special‖
       meals.
   20.31.2. Expenses incident to groundbreaking or dedication ceremonies. Examples include
   the engraving and chrome-plating of a ceremonial shovel, flowers used as centerpieces or
   ribbons to cut at a dedication ceremony, as well as group photographs and the printing of
   programs and invitations for cornerstone ceremonies. Do not provide free food, snacks,
   beverages, etc., or food and drink serving items. (See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4,
   paragraph 4.27.1.)
       20.31.2.1. O&M 3400 funds may be used in lieu of MILCON funds if the construction
       contract does not specifically include the groundbreaking/dedication ceremonial
       requirements.
       20.31.2.2. Use NAF funds for groundbreaking and newly constructed building
       dedication ceremonies if the construction costs are funded by NAF.
138                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


      20.31.2.3. Use MFH (Construction or O&M) for groundbreaking or newly constructed
      building dedication ceremonies if the construction costs are funded by MFH Construction
      funds.
      20.31.2.4. ORF is not authorized for these circumstances in the event local dignitaries or
      other distinguished personnel are invited to attend the ceremonies. The attendance of
      these individuals is incidental to the purpose of these ceremonies and does not conform to
      the intent of AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds Guidance and Procedures.
  20.31.3. Drinking water, only when it is a necessary expense from the government‘s
  standpoint when (1) the public water supply is unsafe for human consumption, (2) there is an
  emergency failure of the water source on the installation, (3) a temporary facility has no
  drinking water available within a reasonable distance, and (4) there is no water fit for
  drinking purposes available without cost or at a lower cost to the government (See AFI 65-
  601, Volume 1 and AFI 65-601, Volume 1_AMCSUP, paragraph 4.45. (et seqq), and
  DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph 120203.).
  20.31.4. Installation commanders may use APF to finance base museums, Air Force
  exhibits, and air parks. The Air Force encourages but does not require a foundation to
  establish and operate a museum. When foundation funds are inadequate, you may use APF
  providing the costs are reasonable and in line with the base mission and funding priorities.
  Establish a MOA between the installation and the foundation, outlining the responsibilities
  and limitations for each party, including a general description of those areas where the
  foundation will assist the museum. (See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.25.2.
  and AFI 84-103.) NOTE: There is no authority for using APF to commercially procure
  model aircraft regardless of the scale to which it is constructed or its intended purpose (e.g.,
  indoor or outdoor display), unless the aircraft models are a specific requirement for a
  certified Air Force Field Museum under the auspices of AFI 84-103, U.S. Air Force Heritage
  Program, chapter 11. If the Aviation Maintenance and Reclamation Center (AMARC) at
  Davis-Monthan AFB AZ can furnish an aircraft from its inventory to use for a static display,
  APF can fund for the packing crating, handling, and transportation and also build the
  stand/pedestal to support it.
  20.31.5. Ethnic Observances. This involves activities that recognize the contributions that
  minorities and women have made to society, including scholarly lectures, historical exhibits,
  art exhibits, displays, and musical groups, including those procured from the private sector.
  You may use APF to finance the following related items:
      20.31.5.1. Live artistic performances as an authorized part of an equal employment
      opportunity (EEO) effort if it is part of a formal program determined to advance EEO
      objectives and promotes EEO training objectives. Do not charge admission for these
      programs in order to pay for additional enhancements as no existing statutory authority
      allows for the collection of such fees.
      20.31.5.2. Lunch meals for guest speakers only if they are away from their homes or
      regular places of business.
      20.31.5.3. Small ―samples‖ of ethnic foods prepared and served during a formal ethnic
      awareness program. They should be minimal and are not intended to serve as meals or
      refreshments. (See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.26.1.)
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                       139


  20.31.6. Retirement Flags. 10 U.S.C., Section 8681 directs the Secretary of the Air Force to
  present a U.S. flag to Air Force military members upon the release from active duty for
  retirement, with 20 or more years of active service or those members retiring under
  temporary early retirement authority. You may use unit funds (TWCF, O&M, DHP) for this
  purpose. See paragraph 18.9.3 of this publication for additional guidance. Unit funds are not
  authorized to purchase retirement flag display boxes.
  20.31.7. Table Linens Dishes, Glassware, Tableware, or Kitchen Utensils. Do not use APF
  or TWCF funds to purchase these items for a typical office environment. These must be
  purchased with personal or private institutional funds (e.g., coffee club, office rotary funds)
  for office use. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.42.1.1.1., and chapter 21,
  paragraph 21.9., for additional guidance.
  20.31.8. Command/Wing/Squadron-Sponsored Picnics, Balls and Dances.
     20.31.8.1. There is no statutory authority supporting the use of APF (or TWCF) for these
     types of events at any level. These non-mission essential functions are considered
     unofficial social events/entertainment and are not eligible for government funding. The
     GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, 2nd Edition, Volume 1, chapter 4,
     section C, part 5, page 4-100 states, ―The rule [is] that appropriated funds may not be
     used for entertainment except when specifically authorized by statute and also authorized
     or approved by proper administrative officers.‖ It further states, ―The basis for rule is that
     entertainment is essentially a personal expense even when it occurs in some business-
     related context. Except when specifically appropriated for, entertainment cannot normally
     be said to be necessary to carry out the purposes of the appropriation.‖
     20.31.8.2. Do not use NAF or SM&W funds to support these events unless specifically
     authorized in AFI 34-201, chapter 4, paragraph 4.3.4. In most cases these events must be
     self-sustaining, paid for with fundraisers and/or individual attendees through the price of
     admission.
     20.31.8.3. An exception to using APF for these events is to rent portable toilets in
     keeping with necessary health and sanitary requirements.
     20.31.8.4. AMCI 65-602, chapter 6, paragraph 6.6.15, specifically forbids the use of
     TWCF funds for entertainment purposes.
     20.31.8.5. Wing-Wide Sports Days. APF is authorized to provide funding assistance for
     Wing-Wide Sports Days, to include rental of support equipment (e.g., canopies, chairs,
     tables, sports equipment, barbecue grills, coolers, etc.) from off-base sources if they are
     not available from the local Services squadron or other base sources. Additionally APF
     may fund officials/ umpires for sporting events and T-shirts, trophies, plaques, or similar
     items for presentation to competition winners. These events may be classified as a
     Category A On-Base Outdoor Recreation Program in accordance with AFI 65-106,
     chapter 8, paragraph 8.7. NOTE: Do not use APF to support sports day events below the
     wing level.
  20.31.9. Health Promotion Items. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.29.6.,
  use only Defense Health Program (FC 2X) funds to purchase authorized promotional items
  (including health snacks) for the Health and Wellness Centers to recognize individuals who
140                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  complete a specific health regimen or program such as a daily exercise routine, smoking
  cessation, or weight loss. Do not use O&M 3400 funds to purchase these items.
  20.31.10. Rewards, Apprehensions, and Confinements.
      20.31.10.1. Missing Property. 10 U.S.C., Section 2252 authorizes the Services to pay a
      reward of not more than $500 in any case for information leading to the discovery of
      missing property under the jurisdiction of that Service or leading to the recovery of such
      property. Pay such rewards out of O&M 3400 funds, BA 02, PE 48534F. DoDFMR
      7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph 120211., provides guidance on the conditions
      for the payment of such rewards. In the event the missing government property belongs
      to a TWCF organization, TWCF funds may be used to pay the reward. NOTE: These
      rewards are not payable to a government employee (military or civilian) for services
      rendered within the scope of his or her official duties (e.g., security forces personnel who
      are investigating the disappearance of the missing government property) in accordance
      with GAO: Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume 1, chapter 4, Section C,
      paragraph 14.e.
      20.31.10.2. There is no authority to establish or pay rewards with TWCF or O&M funds
      for information leading to the apprehension of individuals (military or civilian
      employees) suspected of any criminal offenses, whether committed on-base or off-base.
      20.31.10.3. Apprehension of Military Absentees, Deserters, and Escaped Prisoners. See
      Chapter 6, paragraph 6.1.4.3 of this publication.
      20.31.10.4. Confinement of Military Prisoners in Civilian Detention Facilities. Per AFI
      65-601, Volume 1, chapter 12, paragraph 12.7.6., these costs are charged to the O&M
      3400 funds of the base to which the member is assigned. NOTE: For confined members
      assigned to medical or TWCF organizations, use Wing O&M 3400 funds, not DHP or
      TWCF funds. Funding for civilian incarceration of permanently assigned military
      members is a Wing responsibility, either from O&M unit funds (if assigned to an O&M
      3400-funded organization) or Wing O&M 3400 funds, PE 48534F (for all other
      personnel assigned to non-O&M funded organizations). For members confined to
      civilian detention facilities who are assigned to tenant organizations, refer to the host
      tenant support agreement for funding guidance. For female prisoners, see also DoDFMR
      7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph 120214.
      20.31.10.5. For military absentees, deserters, or escaped prisoners who are apprehended
      and detained by civil authorities pending transfer back to their base of assignment, refer
      to Chapter 6, paragraph 6.1.4.3 of this publication.
  20.31.11. Graduation Ceremonies. Appropriated Funds are allowable to rent space in a NAF
  Category C facility to conduct graduation ceremonies of a significant nature that involve
  military or civilian employees if no other suitable facilities on base are available to host the
  ceremony. The total number of graduates along with the academic affiliation (e.g.,
  graduations from the Community College of the Air Force or other Air University
  curriculums) should be the determining factors when considering APF for this purpose.
  NOTE: The use of APF for these graduations does not extend to purchasing food,
  refreshments, personalized invitations, entertainment, or any other expenses related to the
  ceremony that goes beyond renting the space in the Category C facility. See AFI 65-601,
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                    141


  Volume 1, chapter 4, paragraph 4.27.3. for additional guidance on funding for graduations.
  Additionally, the use of TWCF funds for this purpose is not authorized.
  20.31.12. Fines and Penalties. There is no authority to pay for or reimburse military
  members or civilian employees for fines or penalties they incurred as a result of violating a
  law when acting on their own behalf, beyond the scope of his or her authority. However, if
  the fine or penalty is incurred because the military or civilian member is complying with
  regulatory guidance and instructions and is without fault or negligence (i.e., no personal
  wrongdoing), then it may be paid with APF under the ―necessary expense‖ doctrine.
  Additionally, Air Force organizations are exempt from paying fines and penalties unless
  there is an express statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. Examples of statutory waivers
  are the Clean Air Act, the Prompt Payment Act (see paragraph 20.23 above), and the
  Federal Facility Compliance Guidance (reference Chapter 15, paragraph 15.5 of this
  publication). If the penalty is imposed by court action, it may be paid from the permanent
  judgment appropriation (see paragraph 20.22.5.4 above). For additional guidance, see GAO:
  Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume 1, chapter 4, pages 4-114 through 4-119,
  or consult your legal office.
  20.31.13. Personal Expenses. Follow guidance in DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter
  11, before authorizing payments for personal expenses. See AFI 65-601, Volume
  1_AMCSUP, paragraph 4.87., for additional guidance on funding for personal items in the
  workplace. Other personal expenses include:
     20.31.13.1. (DELETED)
     20.31.13.2. (DELETED)
     20.31.13.3. The purchase and/or mailing of individual video tapes by an organization for
     use by family members as ―video postcards‖ to send to their deployed sponsors is
     considered a personal expense, as would be the case for purchasing postcards, stationery,
     and postage stamps. However, the organization may purchase a videocassette and do a
     random recording of the family members at a unit function and send it to the deployed
     location for the members of the deployed unit to view at their leisure.
     20.31.13.4. Luggage/Suitcases for Deploying/TDY Personnel. Under the ―necessary
     expense‖ rule, Air Force funds are not authorized to purchase luggage or suitcases strictly
     for the personal convenience or comfort of military members and civilian employees
     directed to deploy or go TDY to perform other official mission requirements. However,
     in certain limited cases units may spend organizational funds to purchase these items
     when it is not reasonable to expect its personnel to provide their own luggage in light of
     exceptional wear and tear due to the amount of travel (see CompGen Decision B-200154,
     12 Feb 1981). For these circumstances, the luggage remains the property of the
     purchasing organization that will maintain strict accountability and controls over the
     issuance of the items.
  20.31.14. Alcoholic Beverages. With the exception of ORF, the use of APF to purchase
  alcoholic beverages is generally prohibited. However, APF may be used under the ―necessary
  expense‖ doctrine to purchase alcoholic beverages whenever the Wing Security Forces (SF)
  conduct formal training courses developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety
  Administration that teach techniques to detect personnel who may be driving under the
142                                                          AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  influence of alcohol. The SF organization must develop strict guidelines to ensure there is no
  misuse or abuse of the alcoholic beverages purchased strictly for the training. Prudent
  judgment applies – don‘t purchase more than what is required for the course and strictly
  avoid purchasing expensive brands/types of beverages.
  20.31.15. Refreshments for Blood Donors. The use of O&M 3400 funds is not authorized to
  purchase blood donor refreshments for any Air Force or civilian-sponsored blood drive.
  However, AFI 44-104, The Air Force Blood Program, paragraph 3.1. allows for DHP funds
  (Fund Code 2X, not Subsistence) to purchase refreshments for blood drives held on Air
  Force installations and sponsored by the MTF. Do not use DHP funds to procure
  refreshments relating to civilian-sponsored profit or nonprofit blood drives (e.g., American
  Red Cross, American Association of Blood Banks, etc.).
  20.31.16. Funding for Air Force Band Operations. See AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies
  and Procedures, chapter 10, for funding guidance concerning Air Force bands.
  20.31.17. Funding for Advertising. APF is authorized for payment of printed advertising in
  newspapers, trade journals, and other similar publications provided written authority from
  competent authority (e.g., SECAF or his/her designated authority) is received (44 U.S.C.,
  Section 3702). See DoDFMR 7000.14, Volume 10, chapter 12, paragraph 120218., for
  payment processing and other guidance. Prior SECDEF (or designated authority) written
  approval does not apply to radio advertising as long as it promotes the objectives for which
  appropriated.
  20.31.18. Leasing of Facilities Constructed on Air Force Installations by Private
  Corporations. Absent specific authority, APF is not authorized for lease payments to private
  contractors for facilities they financed to build on Air Force installations. MILCON funds are
  required and, under the scoring rules of OMB Circular A-11, Appendix B, full funding is
  required up front for the entire lease period when the contract is signed.
  20.31.19. Base Floats for Local and National Parades. Under the Necessary Expense Theory,
  you may use APFs to construct a float to participate in a local or national parade from a
  civic/public affairs and recruiting perspective. Fiscal prudence and common sense should
  prevail; the float should be constructed by the local base populace and not by a professional
  contractor. Do not use APFs to purchase candy, beads, or other items to hand out to parade
  spectators – use private funds for this purpose. See also AFI 35-101, chapter 8, paragraph
  8.7. for additional guidance.

                                          Chapter 22

                                CLOSE-OUT PROCEDURES

22.1. General Information. Fiscal year end close-out is probably the most ―turbulent‖ time of
the year for anyone involved in financial management because it is during this period that
everyone responds to a sense of urgency with the looming expiration of current year funds. HQ
AMC/FMA places considerable command attention effectively using available funds for
prioritized operational needs. Likewise, functional attention focuses on the need to ensure the
proper recording of all valid obligations and expenses before the fiscal year-end close-out. The
comptroller office has the lead in orchestrating this monumental task.
22.2. Close-Out Planning.
   22.2.1. The installation commander formally appoints the base comptroller or FMA officer
   as the project officer to monitor and control the year end close-out operation. The project
   officer has the authority to require responsible individuals to adhere to schedules and duties,
   as outlined below, including tenant organizations covered under a support agreement. Project
   officer responsibilities include:
       22.2.1.1. Reporting status of funds, unfunded requirements, and establishing a schedule
       for implementing close-out actions.
       22.2.1.2. Reviewing the previous years‘ after action reports.
       22.2.1.3. Disseminating and complying with any command close-out update messages or
       memos. These updates will include close-out points of contact, close-out guidance,
       systems interface schedules, and reporting requirements.
       22.2.1.4. Attending all meetings where funding operations are discussed.
       22.2.1.5. Ensuring key base personnel (i.e., group resource advisors, supply, contracting,
       etc.) are available on 30 September to take appropriate year-end actions. (NOTE: These
       personnel may need to stay beyond normal duty hours if the project officer deems that
       additional funds may be forthcoming.)
       22.2.1.6. Convening FWG or FMB meetings, if required.
   22.2.2. All AMC funding points should follow procedures outlined in the annual AMC
   close-out guidance package distributed to the base FMAs several months prior to close-out
   each year. There should be no excuse for a late close-out report. HQ AMC/FMA provides the
   appropriate formats and submission dates for close-out reports in the annual published
   guidance package. RCS: AMC/ FMB(AR)7301 applies.
   22.2.3. Whether the comptroller is the project officer or not, he or she must certify that
   obligations reported in the 30 September accounting reports represent all known obligations
   and expenses, supported by documentary evidence. All base activities controlling and using
   funds, regardless of the appropriation, must work together to assure the validity of
   obligations and expenses.
   22.2.4. To achieve end of year validation, responsible individuals must test each item or
   service to determine its positive need and availability within a reasonable time. The valid
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                    145


  obligation is the amount that is eventually paid. In screening documents for cancellation,
  positive evidence must exist that the obligations are firm. Even though listed as an essential
  or urgent requirement, retaining ―non-firm‖ obligations in the accounting system results in
  the loss of fund utilization. Resource advisors (RAs) are in the best position to make these
  determinations.
     22.2.4.1. RAs are the key to an installation‘s successful close-out. RAs must always be
     extremely familiar with their organizational and program requirements and how much
     money they have available to accomplish them. This is especially critical during close-
     out. If surpluses or deficits develop, consult with the FMA office for the proper course of
     action. You should request funds for high priority needs only and direct excess funding in
     one area to areas where priorities and needs exist.
     22.2.4.2. The effective RA begins this process of program validation in the late June or
     early July time frame, recognizing the hectic pace encountered in September on the
     financial management community. Early starting provides enough lead time for
     document processing. At mid-September, all actions should be completed and the
     accounting records closed out in the base‘s support areas. The only remaining actions
     during the last two weeks of the fiscal year should be ongoing mission requirements,
     personnel travel, and comptroller administrative adjustments.
  22.2.5. The project officer establishes supply and funding control procedures to ensure
  ongoing mission operations do not degrade during fiscal year close-out. Minimize all other
  requirements and funnel through the project officer for processing.
  22.2.6. TDY travel should be limited during the last two weeks of September to only those
  requirements that cannot defer until after 1 October. The effective date of blanket travel
  orders should end two weeks before the end of September. Cover all travel after that date by
  special orders and report it to the FMA office immediately.
     22.2.6.1. Do not perform any travel without published orders in advance. In the event
     anyone must proceed on verbal orders, request confirmation special orders as soon as
     possible, but not later than the first workday after the travel begins.
     22.2.6.2. Commanders and staff officers will direct their personnel returning from TDY
     in September to submit reimbursement vouchers within three working days. If no claims
     exist for these TDYs, advise the travel accounting section in writing so they may properly
     deobligate the funds.
     22.2.6.3. RAs must ensure their organization‘s orderly room or administrative support
     staff are familiar with end of year travel order processing.
  22.2.7. Administratively, comptroller personnel will continuously audit existing
  commitments and obligations for validity and accuracy. This process will have minimal
  impact on organizations whose RAs have kept control and maintained good oversight on
  their programs throughout the fiscal year. The RA who keeps constant vigilance on existing
  commitments, obligations, and expenses will enjoy a smooth close-out.
22.3. O&M, TWCF and MFH Programs.
  22.3.1. Call in your final position for each of the O&M, TWCF, and MFH programs to your
  HQ AMC base analyst in accordance with the dates and times prescribed in the AMC close-
146                                                         AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


  out guidance. Amounts should identify direct targets, obligations, and expenses, undelivered
  orders outstanding (UOOs) for TWCF and limitations. Once you report your final position,
  we do not expect a change unless extraordinary circumstances prevail. Report any variations
  from this position immediately by telephone to your HQ AMC analyst.
  22.3.2. We expect all AMC OBANs to obligate their allocated funds to the maximum extent
  possible. Identify any other unobligated balances for withdrawal before 28 September. HQ
  AMC/FMA will apply withdrawn funds to the command's highest priority unfunded
  requirements.
  22.3.3. For the TWCF, emphasize the validation of all obligations and properly segregate
  expenses and undelivered orders for SMAG due-outs. Deobligate all invalid obligations.
  Ensure that you record outstanding obligations in UOO or AEU depending on whether or not
  goods or services have been received. Report amounts available for withdrawal as early as
  possible to assist the command in reducing overall shortfalls.

                                         Chapter 23

                  MORALE, WELFARE, AND RECREATION (MWR)

23.1. General Information. Within the last few years there have been many changes
concerning what and how much APF support that MWR activities can receive. Consult AFI 65-
106 and AFI 65-106_AMCSUP, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation
(MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs), along with AFI 34-201 to assist in
determining the proper APF funding support for NAF/MWR activities and under what
circumstances APF support is provided.
23.2. MWR Category Activities. There are three separate types of MWR category activities.
AFI 65-106, figure 2.1., provides a complete list of MWR activities by each category and are
defined as follows:
   23.2.1. Category A, Mission Sustaining Activities. These programs are absolutely essential
   to the military mission and provided in all but the most extenuating conditions.
   Consequently, they may receive maximum APF support. Category A activities have the least
   capacity to generate revenue. The Air Force goal is 100 percent APF support where
   authorized. Category A activities group common support activities such as Resource
   Management Flight (RMF) and Human Resources Office (HRO) for reporting purposes only.
   The functions performed by these activities are the basis for APF support. Examples of
   unauthorized APF support are the personnel administration of NAF employees, or accounting
   for NAF resources.
   23.2.2. Category B, Basic Community Support Activities. These activities closely relate to
   Category A and are essentially community support programs with the capacity to generate
   some NAF revenue and may receive substantial support from APF. This category includes
   the essential MWR activities that offer a fundamental core of the MWR programs at Air
   Force bases. The Air Force goal for APF support of category B activities is 50 percent of its
   direct costs.
   23.2.3. Category C, Revenue Generating Activities. Category C activities have the highest
   capacity to generate revenue and are self sustaining, capable of funding most expenses.
   Category C activities are desirable to the military community and make major contributions
   to mission accomplishment and personnel recruitment and retention. Category C activities
   may receive indirect APF support but not direct APF support. EXCEPTIONS: You may use
   direct APF support to correct health and safety deficiencies as well as any authorized
   exemptions for overseas and designated remote and isolated locations.
23.3. Support for Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) Purposes. SM&W funding is NAF
expenditures necessary to contribute to the overall morale and welfare of the military
community. The source of these funds comes from a portion of the profits made by NAF
activities and Base exchanges, and managed by the Services squadron. Expenditures must be
conservative, in the best interest of the Air Force, benefit the military community, and not
limited to specific grades or levels of personnel.
   23.3.1. AFI 34-201, chapter 12, provides specific guidance for events and expenditures
   authorized SM&W funding support. AMCS1 to AFI 34-201 authorizes light refreshments for
   specific base events and establishes command SM&W dollar limitations for the various
 148                                                            AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   change of command ceremonies, flowers for spouses at retirement ceremonies, flowers or
   wreaths at funerals, donations to charitable organizations in lieu of flowers, and fruit baskets
   for visiting dignitaries. SM&W prohibitions include support for conferences, workshops, and
   seminars.
   23.3.2. Do not use SM&W funds in lieu of APF for purposes authorized in AFI 65-603
   unless specifically authorized in AFI 34-201, chapter 12.
   23.3.3. In certain situations, you may use both SM&W and APF. In these instances, use
   SM&W funds only when regulatory restrictions preclude the use of APF. For example, APF
   only allows light refreshments for award programs while SM&W allows the purchase of
   meals for the award winners.
23.4. Grounds Maintenance for NAF Category C Activities. When routine grounds
maintenance is scheduled and performed by CE (in-house and contract), APFs pays, excluding
grounds maintenance contracted exclusively by a Category ―C‖ activity. Grounds maintenance
that are not scheduled, routine, or performed by CE (whether in-house or by contract) are a NAF
funding responsibility unless the services are part of an activity for which APFs are authorized
(e.g. facility construction). Maintenance for golf course grounds beyond the immediate area of
the clubhouse are a NAF responsibility. An exception to this rule is at remote and isolated
locations where APFs are appropriate.
23.5. Offsetting NAF Costs with APF in Support of Unique Circumstances. Per AFI 65-
106, chapter 5, paragraph 5.2.4., if the installation commander authorizes the Child Care Center
to extend operations beyond their normal hours in support of alerts, national emergencies, and
the like, you may use APF to offset NAF costs that are not recouped through the fees paid by the
sponsors for child care. Other types of NAF costs which may be reimbursed by APF under
emergency conditions in accordance with DoDI 1400.32 include (1) ID checkers required
outside normal requirements under THREATCON C, D, or B, when directed by the installation
commander, and (2) cost of administrative leave for NAF employees directed by the installation
commander, in accordance with governing guidance or directives, i.e., not more than three days
administrative leave per incident. Use Air Force ESP code 2C (Two Charlie) to track and record
these APF-reimbursable costs. Leave in excess of three days requires installation commander
approval and justification as to why the use of accrued leave or furlough was not appropriate.
See also the MOA between SAF/FMC and HQ USAF/ILV dated 30 Nov 01, Subject: Authority
for Appropriated Funds to Reimburse Nonappropriated Funds Costs, which grants limited APF
reimbursement for Air Force Services NAF costs incurred as a result of Operations Noble Eagle
and Enduring Freedom. Use Air Force ESP code 3C (Three Charlie) to track and record APF-
reimbursable costs for NAF Category C Activities under THREATCON C or higher, in
circumstances when necessary to sustain their capability to generate NAF revenue to support
Category B Activity basic community services.
23.6. Mass Transit Subsidy for NAF Employees. See Chapter 7, paragraph 7.7 of this
publication for funding guidance.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                               149


23.7. MOA Funding for Services Programs. See AFI 65-106_AMCSUP, paragraphs 10.18.1.
and 10.18.2. for guidance on strategic and nonstrategic MOAs respectively. Coordinate these
MOAs through the wing JAG office prior to execution to ensure that all required
statutory/regulatory guidance is met.

                          MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING (MFH)

24.1. General Information. The Military Construction Appropriation is the primary source of
the MFH program. There are two basic types of MFH funds - Fund Code (FC) 3Y (formerly FC
83) Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and FC 3X (formerly FC 89) MFH construction (five-
year funds). AMC executes its MFH program out of both funds. Like O&M budget activities
(BAs), MFH has fenced subdivisions of funding. These fences are called budget projects or sub-
projects in FC 3Y and project or BAANs in FC 3X. NOTE: The FY 2001 Defense
Appropriations Bill contains a restriction that O&M 3400 funds cannot be charged for the
purpose of performing repairs to military family housing units of the Department of Defense,
including areas in such military family housing units that may be used for the purpose of
conducting official Department of Defense business. Therefore, MFH sustainment funds are the
exclusive source funds for sustainment of all family housing units, including General Officer
Quarters (GOQ).
24.2. MFH O&M Fund Code 3Y - Appropriation 7045.
   24.2.1. The MFH program provides funds for the operation and maintenance of government-
   owned family dwelling units, other family housing properties, and leased family housing.
   24.2.2. Operations and Utilities (P721 and P728). Funds in the operations program cover all
   obligations associated with the essential services needed to support MFH. Essential
   operations include categories for management, services, furnishings, and miscellaneous.
   Utilities are funded in project code P728 and discussed in paragraph 24.2.2.5 below.
       24.2.2.1. Management (P721.10). This sub-project provides funds for all costs associated
       with the family housing office, to include office personnel, TDY, supplies, equipment,
       custodial services, occupancy inspections, and housing market analysis. It also provides
       for all direct administration costs to support government-owned, leased, and other family
       housing properties and programs as well as housing referral services at installation level.
       24.2.2.2. Services (P721.20). This sub-project provides for all costs of municipal type
       services, such as custodial services, refuse collection and disposal, fire and police
       protection, entomological services, snow removal, and street cleaning that support
       government-owned family housing units and other family housing properties and
       programs.
       24.2.2.3. Furnishings (P721.40). This sub-project provides for all costs for replacement
       of refrigerators and stoves, inventory increases, maintenance, repair, and moving of these
       appliances. It also provides for specifically authorized items in General Officer Quarters.
       24.2.2.4. Miscellaneous (P721.50). This sub-project provides for costs of country-to-
       country agreements and reimbursements to other United States government agencies and
       foreign governments for other family housing properties and programs. AMC does not
       receive funding in this sub-project.
       24.2.2.5. Utilities (P728). This project provides for costs of all authorized utilities
       consumed in MFH units and facilities. Includes sewage disposal and operations of
       heating plants or utility systems solely supporting MFH.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                   151


  24.2.3. Maintenance (P722). Funds in this project cover the day-to-day maintenance (change
  of occupancy, service calls, etc.) such as, (1) sustainment of buildings, roads, driveways,
  sidewalks, utility systems, and grounds, (2) maintenance, repair, and replacement of integral
  components of installed equipment of a housing unit such as hot water heaters, dishwashers,
  and garbage disposals, furnaces and air conditioners, (3) authorized minor alterations and
  additions, (4) authorized major sustainment and repair projects, (5) supplies and materials,
  (6) self-help stores; (7) maintenance of community antennae and cable TV outlets and wiring
  after installation, and (8) the authorized restoration of damaged or destroyed housing
  facilities.
     24.2.3.1. HQ AMC/FMA issues MFH maintenance funding in the following P722 sub-
     projects:
         24.2.3.1.1. P722.62 - Maintenance and Repair - Government Dwellings.
         24.2.3.1.2. P722.66 - Self-Help Store - Government Dwellings.
         24.2.3.1.3. P722.67 - Self-Help Store - Other.
         24.2.3.1.4. P722.71 - Maintenance and Repair of Utilities (Exterior) - Other.
         24.2.3.1.5. P722.81 - Maintenance and Repair of Other Real Property - Other.
         24.2.3.1.6. P722.91 - Minor Alterations - Government Dwellings.
         24.2.3.1.7. P722.92 - Minor Alterations and Additions - Other.
         24.2.3.1.8. P722.96 - Major Maintenance and Repair - Government Dwellings.
         24.2.3.1.9. P722.97 - Major Maintenance and Repair - Other.
  24.2.4. Domestic Lease Operations and Maintenance (P725 and P726).
     24.2.4.1. Operating Cost of Leased MFH (P725). This project provides for leasing of
     family housing facilities in the United States from private owners, utilities (if not
     provided by the lessor), and services not provided by the lessor when separately
     contracted by the government.
     24.2.4.2. Maintenance of Leased MFH (P726). This project provides for maintenance,
     whether provided by the lessor or separately contracted by the government.
     24.2.4.3. Housing Privatization (P727). This project provides for concept
     development/portfolio management, Supervision Inspection Overhead (SIOH),
     consulting services, and to develop, evaluate, and oversee privatization projects,
     including the cost of consultants hired to assist in these efforts.
24.3. MFH Program Management.
  24.3.1. Proper MFH management is critical to the overall financial well being of an
  installation. Like the O&M 3400 program, there are rules and guidelines concerning the use
  of MFH appropriated funds. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 21 or AFMAN 65-604
  chapter 2 (Family Housing Construction, Air Force and Family Housing Operation and
  Maintenance, Air Force pages) for more details.
  24.3.2. Inattentiveness to this program can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the MFH
  program as well as the larger O&M program. The MFH executes a significant portion of its
 152                                                           AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004


   program as a reimbursement to O&M (e.g., labor costs, bench stock, etc.). Therefore, timely
   and accurate reporting of MFH reimbursements is critical. A close coordination of efforts
   between the CE RA, FMA office, and the supporting DFAS field site is essential to ensure
   sound financial management for the wing commander.
   24.3.3. HQ AMC/FMA issues annual reimbursement authority in sub-project P721.10R.
   You may reprogram reimbursement authority between projects and sub-projects. Earn
   reimbursements for rental collections in the budget project determined to be most beneficial,
   using the appropriate 2-digit shred of EEIC 599. Collect all utility reimbursements in the
   EEIC earned; do not use EEIC 599 for this purpose. Treat your annual reimbursable
   programs as a ceiling that you do not exceed. Reimbursements realized in excess of the
   authorized program do not create additional obligation authority unless there is an increase in
   the program. If you incur obligations to fill these orders before receiving authority to
   increase the program, the effect is a reduction in direct authority, but the total obligation
   authority remains unchanged.
   24.3.4. (DELETED)
   24.3.5. Do not authorize any expenditure for maintenance and repair in excess of $20,000
   per unit without congressional notification. Exclude costs for asbestos and lead-based paint
   removal from calculations to determine the requirements for advance congressional
   notification. When these costs exceed the threshold you must provide an after-the-fact
   notification to HQ AMC. Do not authorize any annual expenditure for maintenance and
   repair of GOQs in excess of $35,000 per unit without congressional approval.
   24.3.6. Do not use MFH funds to (1) acquire land, (2) provide for site preparation, or (3)
   install utilities for any family housing, except housing for which funds have been specifically
   made available in the annual military construction appropriations.
   24.3.7. Do not use MFH funds provided in P721 Operations and P722 Maintenance for the
   acquisition of any housing unit unless specifically authorized by law.
   24.3.8. You must place strong emphasis on the execution of your MFH program. SAF/FMB
   requires a MFH quarterly execution report from the commands. Our obligation rate
   determines any additional current fiscal year funding, as well as the next year‘s program.
   NOTE: SAF/FMB and OUSD(C) do not consider commitments when they determine
   execution rates (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 3, paragraph 3.9.2.6.). Please ensure the
   proper recording of valid MFH obligations in the accounting system when incurred.
   24.3.9. Commands may not obligate more than 20 percent of an appropriation during the last
   2 months of the fiscal year, in accordance with Public Law. However, effective FY98,
   SAF/FMB issued a mid year goal for MFH. The new mid-year (March) obligation goal is 60
   percent and the end of June remains 80 percent. SAF/FMB uses a new mid-year and end-of-
   year distribution system to reward those MAJCOMs who meet these goals. You need to
   closely monitor MFH execution and work with your local CE, LGC, and DFAS to ensure the
   prompt entry of obligations (especially Facility Projects) into the accounting system.
24.4. MFH Construction Fund Code 3X - Appropriation 7040.
   24.4.1. This program provides funds for new construction, post acquisition construction, and
   advance planning and design.
AMCPAM65-603 1 JUNE 2004                                                                      153


   24.4.2. New Construction (Budget Project 711). This project provides for (1) erecting,
   installing, assembling, relocating, or replacing family dwelling units, (2) related land
   acquisition, site preparation, excavating, filling, landscaping, or improving sites relating to
   the work in (1) above, (3) initial outfitting of dwelling units with major equipment and
   fixtures, e.g., kitchen ranges and refrigerators, washing machines, clothes dryers, and
   dishwashers, when authorized in the project approval document (DD Form 1391), (4)
   supervision and inspection of MFH construction (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 21), (5)
   construction of mobile home facilities and non-dwelling buildings associated with a family
   housing area, (6) construction of roads, driveways, sidewalks, and utility systems that
   primarily serve family housing units, (7) construction of community facilities integral to a
   family housing area, (8) the replacement of damaged or destroyed family housing facilities,
   and (9) housing privatization projects scoring costs. NOTE: If the housing privatization
   project proves infeasible, then a MFH construction project is accomplished.
   24.4.3. Post Acquisition Construction (Budget Project 713). This project provides for
   construction to (1) upgrade inadequate family housing quarters and rental housing, (2)
   improve adequate public quarters, (3) convert existing facilities to family housing quarters,
   (4) alter, expand, extend, or repair family dwelling facilities, except as provided in P722
   O&M MFH funding, (5) family housing real property (other that dwelling units), required

   units to make them more energy efficient, and to provide substantial savings in utility costs
   such as upgrade ceilings, roofs, wall insulation, and heating and air conditioning systems to
   current standards, (7) alter family housing to accommodate physically handicapped family
   members, (8) supervision and inspection of construction (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter
   21), and (9) housing privatization projects scoring costs. NOTE: If the housing privatization
   project proves infeasible, then a MFH construction project is accomplished.
   24.4.4. Advance Planning and Design (Budget Project 714). This project provides for
   planning and design of family housing facilities. It includes preliminary and site adaptation
   studies, working drawings, specifications, estimates, project planning reports, and final
   design drawings.
24.5. Housing Damage Liability. Personnel residing in MFH units are liable for damage to the
dwelling and loss or damage of any equipment or furnishings contained therein provided the loss
or damage was caused by abuse or negligence of the member, dependent, or guest of the
member. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 5, paragraph 5.12.22., amounts received for such
damages and losses are considered as a refund, and not a reimbursement, to the MFH
appropriation. As a result, the amounts received as a result of the loss and damage are refunds;
therefore, they are available for immediate obligation for the same purposes and circumstances
as other funds in these accounts.
24.6. Flags for MFH Units. Per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 21, paragraph 21.3.1.10., use
MFH O&M P722 funds to purchase only U.S. and Air Force flags for MFH units. O&M 3400
funds are not authorized for these purchases. All other flags for display on MFH units are a
personal expense. In accordance with HQ AMC/A7 memorandum dated 22 Mar 01, Subject:
Purchase of Flags with Military Family Housing (MFH) Funds, each AMC installation
establishes a flag policy to determine flag size for each neighborhood and standard locations.
While HQ AMC/A7 recommends the purchase of these flags be restricted to key representational

and command billets, they authorize one flag per unit and one issue per family in base housing if
the AMC installation so chooses.
