        4.1.4.1. Property Protection Goal. The property protection goal of this instruction shall
        be to limit damage created by a fire, explosion, or event associated with hazardous
        materials to a reasonable level to the building or facility and adjacent property.
        4.1.4.2. Property Protection Objectives.
        4.1.4.2.1. .Prevention of Ignition. The facility shall be designed, constructed, and
        maintained, and operations associated with the facility shall be conducted, to prevent
        unintentional explosions and fires that result in failure of or damage to adjacent
        compartments, emergency life safety systems, adjacent properties, adjacent outside
        storage, and the facility's structural elements.
            4.1.4.2.2. Fire Spread and Explosions. In the event that a fire or explosion occurs,
            the building or facility shall be sited, designed, constructed, or maintained, and
            operations associated with the facility shall be conducted and protected, to reasonably
            reduce the impact of unwanted fires and explosions on the adjacent compartments,
            emergency life safety systems, adjacent properties, adjacent outside storage, and the
            facility's structural elements.
            4.1.4.2.3. Structural Integrity. Facilities shall be designed, constructed, protected,
            and maintained, and operations associated with the facility shall be conducted, to
            provide a reasonable level of protection for the facility, its contents, and adjacent
            properties from building collapse due to a loss of structural integrity resulting from a
            fire.
            4.1.4.2.4. Hazardous Materials. The facility shall be designed, constructed, and
            maintained, and operations associated with the facility shall be conducted, to provide
            reasonable property protection from damage resulting from fires, explosions, and
            other unsafe conditions associated with the storage, use, and handling of hazardous
            materials therein.
4.2. Fundamental Requirements.
     4.2.1. Multiple Safeguards.
        4.2.1.1. The design of every building or structure intended for human occupancy shall be
        such that reliance for property protection and safety to life does not depend solely on any
        single safeguard.
        4.2.1.2. Additional safeguard(s) shall be provided for property protection and life safety
        in the event that any single safeguard is ineffective due to inappropriate human actions,
        building failure, or system failure.
     4.2.2. Appropriateness of Safeguards. Every building or structure shall be provided with
     means of egress and other safeguards of the kinds, numbers, locations, and capacities
     appropriate to the individual building or structure, with due regard to the following:
        4.2.2.1. Characteristics of the occupancy (such as that posed by a fuel cell repair dock)
        4.2.2.2. Capabilities of the occupants (such as that posed by limited mobility persons)
        4.2.2.3. Number of persons exposed (such as that posed in bldg 3001)

          the way to a place of safety is indicated in a clear manner.
          4.2.3.2.3. Lighting. Illumination of means of egress shall be provided IAW NFPA
          101.
   4.2.4. Occupant Notification. In every building or structure of such size, arrangement, or
   occupancy that a fire itself could not provide adequate occupant warning, fire alarm systems
   shall be provided where necessary to warn occupants of the existence of fire. All new fire
   notification systems on TAFB shall be intelligent systems compatible with the base fire
   alarm reporting system.
   4.2.5. Vertical Openings. Every vertical opening between the floors of a building shall be
   suitably enclosed or protected, as necessary, to provide the following:
      4.2.5.1. Reasonable safety to occupants while using the means of egress by preventing
      spread of fire, smoke, or fumes through vertical openings from floor to floor to allow
      occupants to complete their use of the means of egress.
      4.2.5.2. Limitation of damage to the buildings and its contents
   4.2.6. System Design/Installation. Any fire protection system, building service equipment,

6.1. Comply with NFPA 1, UFC 3-600-1, NFPA 101, and Air Force ETL’s except as
modified or addressed in this document.
6.2. Classification of Occupancy.
   6.2.1. This chapter deals with how a facility is classified for purposes of addressing life
   safety and hazard issues. The life safety code, NFPA 101, uses occupancy classifications to
   categorize buildings and structures based on who the primary user is and function of the
   space.
   6.2.2. New Construction: During the design process this classification should be assigned
   by the Fire Protection Engineer or delegate using NFPA 1, NFPA 101, and UFC 3-600-1.
   6.2.3. Existing Construction: For Fire Prevention Safety Assessments the authority having
   jurisdiction is the Tinker AFB Fire & Emergency Services Fire Prevention Branch at 734-
   3981.
   6.2.4. For renovation projects and repairs of existing facilities, engineers will coordinate
   with the 72 ABW Fire Prevention Branch on classification of the occupancy. The 72 ABW
   Civil Engineer will have final approval in cases where the engineer and the Fire Department
   do not agree.
   6.2.5. Building 3001 is a mixed occupancy however the primary function is industry. To
   date areas west of the Y wall are classified Industrial General Purpose. They are not aircraft
   hangars. The area east of the Y wall and north of the cafeteria is classified Business
   Occupancy. The cafeteria is classified as public assembly.

USAF Welding, Cutting, and Brazing Permit, must be issued prior to starting hot work
operations. Personnel may attend training provided by the 72 ABW/CEF Fire Prevention Office,
which authorizes that member to issue permits in non-hazardous areas. A list of personnel
authorized to issue permits will be maintained by 72 ABW/CEF Fire Prevention Office.
   41.2.1. AF Form 592, USAF Welding, Cutting, and Brazing Permit, will only be issued by a
   qualified fire inspector from the 72 ABW/CEF Fire Prevention Office in any of following
   areas:
       41.2.1.1. All aircraft hangars
       41.2.1.2. Munitions storage areas
       41.2.1.3. Flammable storage areas
       41.2.1.4. Any location intimate to the roof or along the catwalks of building 3001
       41.2.1.5. In facilities where the fire suppression system is inoperative
   41.2.2. Welding on an aircraft will be authorized only when approved by the Aircraft
   Maintenance Officer, in coordination with 72 ABW/CEF and 72 ABW/SE prior to the
   welding operation.
   41.2.3. Authorized welding locations: Welding shops will be evaluated and approved by 72
   ABW/CEF and Bioenvironmental Engineering prior to the start-up of welding/cutting
   operations. A signed letter of authorization coordinated through 72 ABW/CEF Fire
   Prevention Office shall be maintained in the work area.
