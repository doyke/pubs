This instruction implements the Air Force Survivor Assistance Program (AFSAP). It formalizes proce-
dures for commanders and functional managers to provide information, referrals, death benefits, and other
forms of assistance to the next-of-kin and other family members of persons who lose their lives due to Air
Force aviation mishaps. It establishes training requirements for commanders and assigned family liaison
officers, as well as notional milestones for ensuring that information flow and family assistance is ren-
dered in a timely and appropriate manner. It prescribes a central Air Force point of contact (POC) in Air
Force aviation mishaps involving interagency coordination. It implements Air Force Policy Directive
(AFPD) 34-11, Service to Survivors. It applies to commanders, managers, supervisors, and functional
staffs at all levels. This instruction applies to Air Reserve Component (ARC) forces to the extent they are
capable of providing required services; active duty commanders will provide support to ARC command-
ers as necessary to fully comply with all requirements.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates Interim Change 2001-1 and directs the Air Force to provide the same level of
care to the survivors of any Air Force team member who dies, regardless of how the member dies or
where assigned. This includes the appointment of a Family Liaison Officer (FLO) and all support/assis-
tance allowed by law. It also recommends a FLO be offered to an active duty member in the event of the
death of an immediate family member. Responsibilities for wing commanders, unit commanders who
experience the death of a member, MAJCOM SVs, base mortuary affairs officers, and FLOs are clarified.
One-year anniversary condolence letters for all active duty deaths are required. These letters are generated
by the losing unit, signed by the wing/installation commander, with a signed copy forwarded to the base
Mortuary Affairs Office, the MAJCOM SV, and HQ USAF/ILV. Requirement for FLOs to maintain fam-
ily contact logs and provide a completed copy to the mortuary affairs office for inclusion in the mortuary
case file is added. Samples of FLO appointment orders and the one-year anniversary condolence letter are
added. A bar ( | ) indicates revisions from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last
attachment.

                       OBJECTIVES AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

                                               Chapter 1

                             RENDERING SERVICE TO SURVIVORS

1.1. Philosophy:
   1.1.1. The Air Force has numerous resources to draw upon following the death of an Air Force team
   member. The Air Force team includes active duty, reserve, guard, and civilian federal employees. The
   Air Force may sometimes also assist families of private citizens, e.g., private citizen killed by Air
   Force plane crash or AF retiree killed while travelling Space-A or contractor killed while supporting
   the Air Force mission. However, it is difficult to accurately forecast the amount of assistance required
   or even available, or the duration for which it might be needed, in any future incident. While many
   institutions are geared toward improving our people’s quality of life, those same institutions, along
   with many other purpose-designed processes, may play a significant role in supporting survivors upon
   the death of an Air Force team member. Regardless of the category of the deceased, the family should
   be rendered the maximum level of assistance permitted by law.
      1.1.1.1. This AFI will concentrate on aircraft incidents due to their catastrophic impact and public
      interest. However, the survivors of any Air Force member or civilian employee who dies, regard-
      less of cause of death or place of assignment, should be provided a FLO and the maximum level
      of assistance permitted by law.
      1.1.1.1. (ANG) This includes Air National Guard members, no matter what their duty status.
      1.1.1.2. Additionally, commanders should consider appointing a FLO to assist active duty mem-
      bers who experience a death in their immediate family.
      1.1.1.2. (ANG) This includes immediate family of Air National Guard personnel, no matter what
      the duty status of the member.
   1.1.2. The Air Force Survivor Assistance Program (AFSAP) is designed to marshal all available
   resources in support of family needs following unexpected loss of life. At the same time, the AFSAP
   is also intended to provide a systematic structure within which offers of assistance, information, and
   support are made available on the family’s terms. Grieving families have different needs, so each case
   must be considered and handled on an individual basis.
   1.1.3. Under this instruction, the guiding principles of all services and support to families are timeli-
   ness, relevance, and compassion. “Timeliness” means efficient information flow and promptness in
   the delivery of services and response to inquiries. “Relevance” means tailoring both information and
   services to the needs and expressed desires of the surviving family members. “Compassion” means
   responding with empathy to the best of one’s ability, just as those providing information and services
   would wish their own families to be treated.
   1.1.4. This instruction also acknowledges the possibility that non-Air Force persons can be lost in the
   conduct of Air Force operations, e.g., as passengers aboard our aircraft or as bystanders. The Air
   Force recognizes it has obligations to the survivors of such persons, and the AFSAP will be applied to
   provide all possible assistance within the limits of the law to those families as well.

1.2. Procedural Guidance:
    1.2.1. This instruction is the source document for Air Force policies and procedures regarding
    post-mishap information flow to families and the integration and harmonization of benefits and assis-
    tance.
    1.2.2. This instruction is not intended to replace guidance regarding individual entitlements, benefits
    and services contained in function-specific directives. A comprehensive list of the publications most
    commonly required when seeking answers to post-fatality questions and concerns is provided at
    Attachment 1. Commanders and other users of this instruction are expected to use both this instruc-
    tion and the source documents listed in Attachment 1 to gain a working understanding of the range of
    services available to help them help those in need.
    1.2.3. Each Air Force organization and functional manager responsible for a process which is integral
    to the objectives of the Air Force Survivor Assistance Program will ensure the directives listed in
    Attachment 1 of this instruction provide detailed policy and guidance which harmonize with and
    complement this instruction. The Office of Survivor Assistance (AF/ILV) will ensure this instruction
    is kept current through regular consultation with the interacting functions. (This office and its func-
    tions are described in greater detail in Chapter 2 and Chapter 10).

1.3. Use of This Instruction:
    1.3.1. This instruction provides an overview of services and support, that should be offered to fami-
    lies following fatalities resulting from Air Force aviation mishaps. It is organized as follows:
    1.3.1. (ANG) For Air National Guard, this instruction, as supplemented, applies to all fatalities,
    regardless of cause.
       1.3.1.1. Part I of the instruction is devoted to an explanation of the various components of the Air
       Force Survivor Assistance Program, an overview of key persons associated with delivery of ser-
       vices under the program, and program training requirements.
       1.3.1.2. Part II explains specific functional processes associated with post-fatality support in the
       chronological order in which they are typically needed. The attachments contain terminology;
       checklists for post-loss activities; notional milestones for providing mortuary and casualty assis-
       tance briefings and releasable investigation information; and supplementary information for com-
       manders and families.
    1.3.2. The needs and complications associated with providing assistance to some specific classes of
    persons can be anticipated before a major loss occurs. Other people who may require and warrant
    similar support may not be recognized until their need is identified following a loss. In either case,
    this instruction is intended to provide commanders with a starting point for development of suitable
    support and information flow strategies, which must be tailored to fit the needs of each individual
    case.
    1.3.3. Use of the procedures and assistance strategy described in this instruction does not constitute
    an admission of legal liability for any fatalities or property losses that may have been experienced in
    conjunction with an Air Force mishap. Use of the procedures and support processes described in this
    instruction is solely intended to assure timely, appropriate, and compassionate humanitarian assis-
    tance within the limits of Federal law. Therefore, just as it is essential to be timely, focused, and com-
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                               9


   passionate in their dealings with the bereaved, it is crucial for Air Force personnel to keep promises
   made to next-of-kin and other survivors, but to avoid making any promises which cannot be kept.
   1.3.4. In rare cases, a loss initially thought to be accidental will subsequently be determined to be the
   result of a criminal act. In such cases, the Air Force immediately suspends its prevention and account-
   ability-oriented investigations in favor of a criminal investigation.
       1.3.4.1. This instruction primarily applies to families of victims of aviation mishaps. Other
       instructions may be adopted for applications other than aviation mishaps. Unless there is a spe-
       cific instruction for assistance to victims that applies to an incident (i.e. terrorist or criminal activ-
       ities or other types of incidents), this instruction should be used as guidance for assisting family
       members.
           1.3.4.1.1. Families finding themselves in circumstances involving criminal activity should
           also be referred to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice; Chapter 7, “Victim and
           Witness Assistance,” which describes the Air Force Victim and Witness Assistance Program
           (VWAP), and implements the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C.
           10601-10605), the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10606, 10607),
           DoD Directive 1030.1, Victim and Witness Assistance, November 23, 1994, and DoD Instruc-
           tion 1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures, December 23, 1994. Specifically, it
           provides guidance for the treatment of victims and witnesses of offenses under the UCMJ, and
           victims and witnesses of offenses under the jurisdiction of local, state, other federal or foreign
           authorities during those stages of the criminal justice process conducted primarily by the Air
           Force.
           1.3.4.1.2. The following are objectives of the Air Force VWAP: 1) mitigate the physical, psy-
           chological, and financial hardships suffered by victims and witnesses of offenses investigated
           by US Air Force authorities; 2) foster cooperation of victims and witnesses within the military
           criminal justice system; and ensure best efforts are made to accord to victims of crime certain
           enumerated rights.
       1.3.4.2. Through the AFSAP, the Air Force is committed to ensuring all appropriate resources and
       legally releasable information are made available to families who have suffered a loss, regardless
       of the nature of the event which caused it.

1.4. Persons Eligible to Receive Information and Assistance Under This Instruction. This instruc-
tion is designed to help commanders anticipate and plan to assist a broad range of individuals who could
require post-loss information, support, or specific benefits and entitlements following a fatal Air Force
mishap. The specific directive appropriate to the entitlement in questionmust be directly consulted when-
ever definitive guidance is required. However, all of the persons described in this paragraph are entitled
to effective and caring communication, and all will be provided information regarding the investigation
into their loved one’s loss.
   1.4.1. Next-of-Kin (NOK):
       1.4.1.1. “Next-of-kin” is the term used to describe the sole person who has a specific, legally
       defined relationship with another person who has become a casualty, i.e., died or been injured.
       However, the term has subtly different connotations depending on the context and the services in
       question. For example, AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, defines NOK first as “a member’s rela-
       tives,” then further refines that definition as “the person most closely related to the casualty.” On
10                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


        the other hand, the definition of “next-of-kin” under AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, is
        more focused on which NOK has the authority to make specific decisions regarding the disposi-
        tion of human remains and personal property. Both definitions are expanded upon in Attachment
        1, Section C of this instruction, but readers are cautioned to consult the source documents for the
        most precise and current definitions.
        1.4.1.2. For the purposes of this instruction, the next-of-kin is defined as that person whose name
        appears on the DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data, in the deceased member’s Unit Personnel
        Record Group. (See Attachment 11 to this instruction, as well as AFI 36-3002, Chapters 3 and 7,
        for an expanded discussion of this form’s use and importance.) The NOK is frequently called upon
        to make decisions and choices, which require comprehensive explanation and sound advice. The
        burden of these responsibilities, coupled with an unexpected loss of a loved one, mandates that the
        NOK be the primary focus of all such services and considerations described in this instruction.
        1.4.1.3. For the purposes of this instruction, unless a specific individual previously has been iden-
        tified by the deceased to be notified in an emergency (i.e., on the DD Form 93), the next-of kin
        will be presumed to be the person most closely related to the victim: the parents(s) of a single per-
        son without children, a spouse, or child(ren) of a single parent.
     1.4.2. “Survivors” and “Dependents:”
        1.4.2.1. The terms, “survivors” and “dependents” have slightly different meanings in the context
        of different laws and directives. They typically refer to persons related directly to a decedent by
        blood or marriage. AFI 34-501 provides a comprehensive definition of “dependents” in conjunc-
        tion with the delivery of mortuary services, which has been adopted for this instruction as well;
        other directives may define a “dependent” differently. Consult the appropriate source document
        for the function concerned as necessary.
        1.4.2.2. The related term “rights of survivorship” also has variable meanings in a legal sense
        from one state to the next, particularly with respect to conveyance of titles, property, or the hold-
        ings of joint bank accounts and safe deposit boxes. Legal interpretation within the jurisdiction
        where specific actions take place is essential to insure the rights of all concerned are properly pro-
        tected; consult the nearest Staff Judge Advocate for further guidance on such interpretations.
     1.4.3. “Family Members.” A working definition of persons who should be considered “family mem-
     bers” is essential to the effectiveness of the processes described in this instruction. This is a complex
     issue, particularly in that the Air Force must distinguish between those who have unequivocal rights
     to certain entitlements and the far wider range of individuals with legitimate interest in the circum-
     stances surrounding the death of a loved one. This instruction embodies a broader definition of the
     concept of “family” than is found in other Air Force publications because it is designed to serve the
     needs of the entire spectrum of persons who have experienced a personal loss. Therefore, the follow-
     ing discussion and definitions are for the purposes of this instruction only, and may not be applied to
     any other Air Force policy or process:
        1.4.3.1. The changing structure of the American family and advances in telecommunications
        necessitate a two-pronged definition of “family.” For the purpose of Notification and Casualty
        Assistance, “family” is defined as next-of-kin (NOK), i.e., the person most closely related to the
        victim, normally the parent(s) of a single person without children, a spouse, or child(ren) of a sin-
        gle parent, OR the individual identified by the deceased to be notified in an emergency. For the
        purpose of assistance, “family” is defined as the spouse and children, as well as others who have
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                         11


     similar blood or affinity relationships. While a spouse and/or children are normally the focus of
     assistance, bear in mind that a deceased person’s parents also suffer from an unexpected and pain-
     ful loss, in a way different in character but no less devastating in impact; they must be given due
     consideration, support, and information to the maximum extent practical.
     1.4.3.2. The concept of “family members” is extremely flexible within American society and cus-
     tom. While some laws and directives set specific limits based on the Air Force’s ability and legal
     right to deliver certain benefits, they do not anticipate every possible eventuality. The following
     do not represent all-inclusive situations, but are examples of factors, which should be taken into
     consideration in each instance where judgments must be made regarding entitlement to specific
     support and assistance: 1) depending upon the cultural background of the persons lost in a given
     mishap, a large number of individuals may identify themselves as part of their extended family;
     for example, stepparents who were in a member’s home before the member joined the Air Force
     should be given consideration as family. 2) The divorce and remarriage of persons lost in Air
     Force aviation mishaps or their parents can present complex possibilities. 3) In many cases other
     persons, such as fiancées or others who enjoyed long-term relationships with the deceased may
     warrant consideration as “family” for information flow purposes. Commanders should approach
     each situation of this type sensitively, but only in close consultation with their staff judge advo-
     cate.
     1.4.3.3. Given the wide range of familial relationships, a commander may be obliged to recognize
     a greater number of individuals in providing desired information, support, or services. In such
     cases, first priority must be given to current spouses and blood relatives. Stepparents and other
     persons also warrant consideration and should be given preference for support and information
     provided under this instruction.
  1.4.4. Families of Civilian Decedents. If a private citizen dies in conjunction with an Air Force oper-
  ation, his or her family is entitled to as much assistance as is permitted under the law. A more in-depth
  discussion of the services available to private citizens is provided in Chapter 7. See also paragraph
  1.4.6.3. for discussion of the problem of “culture” in this context.
  1.4.5. Families of Foreign Decedents. A broad array of considerations, such as status of forces
  agreements, treaties, memoranda of agreement, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Stan-
  dardization Agreements (STANAG), and international law may come into play in such cases. How-
  ever, for the purposes of this instruction, the survivors of any foreign national involved in an Air Force
  mishap, will be offered timely and compassionate assistance within the limits of the law, and are enti-
  tled to the same information flow as citizens under similar circumstances.
  1.4.6. Relationships Warranting Special Consideration:
     1.4.6.1. Military Survivors. For the purposes of this instruction, the term “military survivors”
     refers to active duty and ARC spouses of Air Force members who die. These individuals custom-
     arily receive caring personal support from their own supervisors and co-workers. However, com-
     manders must ensure that all of their legal, informational, and emotional needs are satisfied in the
     same way, as would be the case if the spouse were a dependent civilian. No presumption may be
     made to the effect that a military survivor is inherently more capable than a civilian in managing
     death-related affairs. Specific problems can arise in the post-death personnel management of mil-
     itary survivors. These fall into two categories: removal from join-spouse assignment status, and
     deployment eligibility.
12                                                         AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


        1.4.6.1.1. Join-spouse assignments (explained in AFI 36-2210, Assignments) frequently result
        in career choices and compromises between married members, as well as between individuals
        and their career managers. Military survivors who suddenly become single parents may have
        special problems with respect to mobility and deployment operations. If their care plan (AF
        Form 357; see AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans) relied upon their spouse’s availability, such
        plans will need to be reconsidered. Moreover, children who suddenly lose a parent immedi-
        ately become far more emotionally dependent on the remaining parent.
        1.4.6.1.2. Military survivors may be eligible for humanitarian reassignment or temporary duty
        (TDY) deferment per AFI 36-2110, Assignments; the latter could prevent them from being
        sent on an involuntary TDY for up to one year. Regardless of their eligibility for humanitar-
        ian-based personnel actions, commanders should delay or cancel a military survivor’s deploy-
        ments for no less than 90 days, and preferably up to 180 days, after their loss subject to
        operational requirements.
     1.4.6.2. Survivors of Retired Air Force Personnel:
        1.4.6.2.1. Retired personnel have space-available privileges aboard Air Force aircraft, and
        some have died while traveling in this capacity. Services available to the families of deceased
        active duty members may not be available or as readily accessible to the families of retired
        personnel. These events, while rare, can become complicated.
        1.4.6.2.2. Generally, the Air Force recognizes that a death which occurs in conjunction with a
        retired member’s availing him/herself of an entitlement, such as during treatment at a medical
        treatment facility or space-available travel may create specific liabilities and obligations which
        have been expanded upon in both directives and case law.
        1.4.6.2.3. Commanders should consult the following references when seeking to assist the
        families of deceased retired members: AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, Attachment 22, “Ben-
        efits for Dependents and Survivors of Retired Air Force Casualties” and AFPAM 34-260,
        Mortuary Services Benefits for Retired Air Force Members. Since retirees may also be mem-
        bers of the federal civil service or otherwise treated as “civilians” under this instruction, com-
        manders should consult Chapter 7, “Benefits and Services for Survivors of Civilians”, of this
        instruction for additional relevant details.
     1.4.6.3. Survivors of Air Force Civilian Personnel:
        1.4.6.3.1. Survivors of Air Force civilian personnel who are unfamiliar with Air Force func-
        tions, traditions, and culture may require special assistance from commanders and civilian
        supervisors. Spouses of Air Force civilian employees in some cases may never have been on
        an Air Force installation; they may not consider their spouse’s employment as having been
        directly related to the Air Force or national defense; and, depending upon the circumstances of
        the death and their spouse’s typical exposure to risk on the job, they may harbor ambivalent
        feelings about the uniformed members of the Air Force who will be trying to carry out their
        obligations to the civilian employee’s family.

         KEY PERSONNEL IN THE ASSEMBLY AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND
                                INFORMATION

2.1. The Chain of Command of the Unit Experiencing the Loss. Military operations carry with them
an inherent risk of loss. Commanders have an ongoing obligation to ensure the members under their com-
mand are aware of those risks and manage them responsibly. In turn, members owe it to their families to
keep them aware of the nature of their duties and the hazards they entail. Post-loss support of the survivors
of deceased military members is an inherent obligation of command. By extension, if persons from out-
side the unit, including civilians, suffer loss of life as a result of Air Force operations, the chain of com-
mand of the unit most closely associated with the event must ensure support and assistance are rendered
to those survivors to the maximum extent allowable by law. Wing/installation commanders attempting to
fulfill such obligations will be supported by their parent MAJCOM. Should Air Force-level assistance be
required (for logistics, funding, etc), the Office of Survivor Assistance (see paragraph 2.11.) will work
with the entire chain of command to help execute the provisions of this instruction as fully as possible.
(Support to the families of civilians is expanded upon in Chapter 7 of this instruction). Specific respon-
sibilities are as follows:
   2.1.1. MAJCOM Commanders:
       2.1.1.1. Who are responsible for convening investigations of fatal mishaps in accordance with
       AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFI 51-503, Aircraft, Missile, Nuclear, and
       Space Accident Investigations, must ensure timely, effective communication of releasable infor-
       mation from those investigations to survivors, Air Force members, the media, and the public in
       accordance with this instruction.
       2.1.1.2. Appoint single points of contact (POC), generally the MAJCOM/SV, following each fatal
       mishap to ensure effective information flow regarding both the needs of affected families and the
       progress of investigations (see below).
       2.1.1.3. ARC appoints the POC for their mishaps at the discretion of the ARC in coordination
       with the gaining command.
       2.1.1.4. Numbered Air Force (NAF) personnel will not be appointed as MAJCOM POCs unless
       the NAF Vice Commander or other senior NAF staff member is assigned to perform on-scene
       spokesperson duties following a mishap with high public interest (see paragraph 5.4.9.).
   2.1.2. MAJCOM POCs:
       2.1.2.1. The MAJCOM POC is a designated senior officer on the staff of the affected MAJCOM,
       generally the MAJCOM/SV or MAJCOM Director of Services. (AFRC and ANG may also
       appoint a Brigadier General or a Colonel. ANG State HQ will also be involved at the command
       level). MAJCOM/SJA should serve as a legal advisor to the MAJCOM POC and coordinate on
       any information releases, legal issues and benefit determinations.
           2.1.2.1.1. The MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate should not serve as an on-scene spokesperson.
           Should senior officer presence at the scene be deemed necessary, the MAJCOM Staff Judge
           Advocate should assign an attorney to advise the on-scene spokesperson, as appropriate.
14                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


        2.1.2.2. The MAJCOM POC should facilitate information flow to families, the AF, and the public
        by: ensuring all proposed early releases of Safety Investigation Board (SIB) and Accident Investi-
        gation Board (AIB) factual information are authorized in accordance with AFI 51-503; (see para-
        graphs 5.4.2. and 5.4.3.). Providing periodic summaries of investigation information as required,
        to wing/installation commanders, their designated family liaison officers, and the Office of Survi-
        vor Assistance (see below). Providing summaries of investigation information to MAJCOM and
        local public affairs staffs for release to the public once all affected families have been briefed on
        their contents. Providing summaries of this investigation information to their MAJCOM web-
        master for posting on a dedicated “home page” (see paragraph 5.5.).
           2.1.2.2.1. The MAJCOM SV will appoint a MAJCOM survivor assistance representative to
           administer the survivor assistance program. Actions include, but are not limited to, promoting
           survivor assistance awareness, monitoring FLO training and one-year anniversary condolence
           letters, and reporting to HQ USAF/ILV as required.
        2.1.2.3. The MAJCOM POC may be sent to the mishap location, accompanied by a public affairs
        officer, to serve as an official Air Force spokesperson at the discretion of the MAJCOM com-
        mander, but will not be involved in any of the investigative activities or deliberations of either the
        Safety or Accident Investigation Boards.
        2.1.2.4. The MAJCOM POC will not contact SIB members directly for any reason. When contact
        with the SIB is specifically required for the purpose of coordinating the release of factual matters
        under the provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 2254, including the determination of
        whether such a release would impede the ongoing investigations, coordination will be made
        between the AIB President and the SIB President
        2.1.2.5. Cease to perform the duties described above when determined by the MAJCOM/CC/CV
        to be no longer necessary.
     2.1.3. Wing/Installation Commanders:
        2.1.3.1. Responsible for ensuring all functional managers provide support as prescribed in this
        and referenced instructions.
        2.1.3.2. Ensure timely and effective flow of information to families regarding the loss of a mem-
        ber under their command by appointing family liaison officers (see below) for all affected families
        (see paragraph 5.4. for an expanded explanation of this process).
        2.1.3.2. (ANG) For Air National Guard, appoint a Family Liaison Officer (FLO) regardless of
        deceased member’s duty status at time of death. Assign a FLO from the installation’s AGRs and
        full-time technicians, preferably within the deceased member’s own squadron or flight, but defi-
        nitely within the appropriate group (operations, mission support, etc.).
        2.1.3.3. Take responsibility for initiating timely and effective flow of information to the families
        of persons involved in an AF mishap, when one of their aircraft is associated with such a loss or
        when an investigative report of any type is initiated due to the death.
        2.1.3.4. Ensure “just-in-time” refresher training and personal briefings are provided to all family
        liaison officers upon their appointment following a fatal mishap. Practice FLO program as part of
        unit readiness exercises. (ARC wing/group commanders will provide “just-in-time” training to
        designated FLOs, if time and resources permit; the greater stability of ARC forces may partially
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        15


       offset the need for comprehensive refresher training if FLOs are identified and trained well in
       advance of need.)
       2.1.3.5. Ensure family liaison officer appointments do not adversely affect mission capability or
       unit readiness where mass casualties or small units are involved by requesting augmentation from
       similar units at other bases as necessary (augmentees may be for operational purposes or assigned
       to FLO duty as the situation dictates).
       2.1.3.6. Ensure sufficient number of FLOs are appointed and trained, considering the installation
       aircraft, runway capacity, and mission requirements. It is recommended every unit provide a min-
       imum of two FLOs (one officer and one senior enlisted) and flying squadrons provide as many
       FLOs as the maximum crew complement. For example, an installation with aircraft requiring a
       crew of one may not need as many FLOs as an installation with aircraft requiring a crew of eight.
       2.1.3.7. Appoint, on orders, one FLO per family. (Sample FLO order is at Attachment 12). Typ-
       ically, a FLO is appointed from the home base of the deceased. However, it is sometimes more
       beneficial to the family to appoint a FLO from a base closer to that family. Coordinate this assis-
       tance, as necessary.
       2.1.3.8. Forward a one-year anniversary condolence letter to next of kin and family members. The
       unit who lost the member(s) prepares this letter. The base SV, MAJCOM SV, and HQ USAF/ILV
       must be included as cc recipients. (Sample condolence letter is at Attachment 13).
       2.1.3.8. (ANG) This includes Air National Guard units. This will be accomplished for all ANG
       members, regardless of duty status at time of death or cause of death.
   2.1.4. Unit commanders:
       2.1.4.1. Represent the first line of communication for families to ensure their needs are addressed
       as completely as law, directives, and custom allow.
       2.1.4.2. Ensure potential family liaison officers are prepared to render assistance to families in
       crisis following the death of a unit member by identifying and training unit personnel for such ser-
       vice in advance of a fatal mishap as described in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
       2.1.4.3. Prepare a one-year anniversary condolence letter for wing commander signature approx-
       imately 30 days before the one-year anniversary death date of their unit member. The base SV,
       MAJCOM SV, and HQ USAF/ILV must be included as cc recipients. (Sample condolence letter is
       at Attachment 13).
       2.1.4.3. (ANG) This includes Air National Guard units. This will be accomplished for all ANG
       members, regardless of duty status at time of death or cause of death.

2.2. The Family Liaison Officer (FLO). The Family Liaison Officer is integral to the delivery of ser-
vices and timely information to families. Family Liaison Officers:
   2.2.1. Are nominated to wing/installation commanders by unit commanders and provided initial
   training by the Services squadron or Services division personnel in accordance with this instruction
   before a fatal mishap requires their services. Family Liaison Officers should be appointed in writing
   by the wing/installation commander.
   2.2.2. Will be assigned by wing/installation commander to each NOK, and to other family members
   as required, within 24 hours of a fatal Air Force mishap. Initially, a single FLO will be assigned for
16                                                             AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     each person lost in the mishap and will interact with only the family members affected by that per-
     son’s loss.
     2.2.3. Are provided formal training on their duties. Services squadron or Services Division personnel
     will facilitate this training. Training should be accomplished before the FLOs make initial contact
     with the families they are to support.
     2.2.4. Are relieved of all other duties until the involved person’s funeral is complete.
     2.2.5. Are expected to make contact with the families to which they are assigned at least daily until
     the funeral is over, and periodically as the situation warrants until the accident investigation is com-
     plete, unless the family wishes otherwise.
     2.2.6. Will help families conduct benefits-related business with other Air Force personnel (casualty
     affairs, mortuary affairs, etc.) and to work with other supporting military personnel as needed. With
     the concurrence of the families involved, this includes being present at all meetings and briefings
     where families are provided specific benefits-related information.
     2.2.7. Should be “crew counterparts” (i.e., pilots for the families of pilots, navigators for the families
     of navigators, squadron members, etc) whenever practical. CAUTION: Before recommending a FLO
     to the wing/installation commander for appointment, the unit commander should make every effort to
     determine the recommended individual is not too close to the situation (i.e., dealing with own grief) to
     be effective in assisting the family.
     2.2.8. May be senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 or higher) to support the family of an enlisted
     member.
     2.2.9. May be Guardsmen, Reservists, or AF civilian personnel. (Consult with civilian personnel spe-
     cialist before appointment of a civilian FLO to ensure compliance with possible duty restrictions.)
     2.2.10. Will not be full-time or additional duty safety or mortuary personnel.
     2.2.11. Receive all non-privileged, releasable investigation information (see paragraph 5.4.) intended
     to reach the families of members who die in Air Force aviation mishaps, but will not seek or solicit
     information associated with the official investigations beyond that provided through MAJCOM chan-
     nels. (NOTE: family questions which go beyond the information provided must be deferred until com-
     pletion of the accident investigation, but will be recorded by the FLO and passed on to the AIB
     through the MAJCOM/SV to ensure they are fully addressed in the family’s outbrief -- see Attach-
     ment 9, paragraph A9.3.)
     2.2.12. Are required to protect privileged, limited-use information as defined by AFI 91-204, Safety
     Investigations and Reports, which they may receive in conjunction with their normal duties.
     2.2.13. Identify situations where referral of family members for mental health assistance may be war-
     ranted.
     2.2.14. Will not attempt to perform the duties of other functions or subject matter experts described in
     this instruction unless expressly authorized to do so by competent authority.
     2.2.15. Will not be part of the casualty notification team.
     2.2.16. Will maintain close contact with base support agencies (medical, legal, mental health, trans-
     portation, family support center, and others) for continued long term assistance and assistance for
     other family members not located on the installation.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          17


   2.2.17. Will keep a log documenting time, place, duration, and subjects covered, etc. for each contact
   with the family. FLOs will maintain contact with the Mortuary Affairs Officer/NCO and provide
   updates as requested by that office. This log will be turned into the Mortuary Affairs Officer/NCO for
   filing in the Mortuary Case File (when a case file is opened) upon completion of FLO duties.

2.3. The Summary Court Officer (SCO). The Summary Court Officer is a commissioned officer
appointed on orders by the installation commander, pursuant to AFI 34-244, Disposition of Personal
Property, to collect, safeguard, and promptly dispose of property belonging to the deceased at the time of
their death. The SCO process is part of the larger Mortuary Affairs program, and is specifically designed
to help survivors through the management procedures necessary to close out a member’s service. The
SCO will not be appointed as the FLO in the same mishap. (See paragraph 6.4. for additional information
on this process.)

2.4. The Safety Investigation Board (SIB) President and Other Board Mem bers:
   2.4.1. While the Air Force has an obligation under Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6055.7
   to fully document the circumstances surrounding every Class A mishap (which is fulfilled by the AIB
   process), it is equally concerned with the problem of preventing recurrence of a similar loss in the
   future. The SIB process is directed solely toward mishap prevention and making recommendations
   aimed at minimizing the potential for future mishaps.
   2.4.2. In accordance with AFI 91-204, SIB Presidents:
       2.4.2.1. Are appointed by and report directly to the MAJCOM commander responsible for the
       investigation.
       2.4.2.2. Are relieved of all other duties for the balance of the investigation.
       2.4.2.3. Lead a team of experts in an investigation directed solely toward preventing mishaps in
       the future.
       2.4.2.4. Transmit status reports regarding their investigation, along with factual information as it
       becomes available, to their counterpart AIB President periodically, unless doing so unduly inter-
       feres with the proper conduct of the SIB.
       2.4.2.5. Limit their communications with family members and the media to the minimum possi-
       ble, and do not release any investigation information directly to either (see Chapter 5).
NOTE: Some direct contact between SIB members and family members is usually unavoidable, since it
is necessary to reconstruct the personal history of crewmembers in the days preceding a mishap to rule out
(or confirm) human performance limitations which might have had a bearing on the mishap sequence.
   2.4.3. SIB Presidents are supported by representatives of the Chief of Safety of the Air Force who are
   assigned to the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC). For the purpose of this instruction, the AFSC repre-
   sentative is a critical link in the orderly flow of information from investigators to families (see expla-
   nation of this process in Chapter 5 of this instruction). However, the principal function of the AFSC
   representative is to bring comprehensive investigative experience and an objective, neutral presence
   to each investigation.

2.5. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President:
18                                                              AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     2.5.1. All Class A flight mishaps must be investigated by an AIB in accordance with AFI 51-503, Air-
     craft, Missile, Nuclear, and Space Accident Investigations. A single fatality results in a Class A mis-
     hap.
     2.5.2. Generally, for mishaps involving a fatality, AIB Presidents are: 1) appointed at the same time
     as SIB presidents, 2) required to proceed to the location where the SIB convenes within 48 hours after
     appointment, 3) the focal point for all factual information provided by the SIB President via the Air
     Force Safety Center’s representative (see below) as it becomes available and 4) required to forward
     progress reports and relevant factual information to the MAJCOM/JAs as they become available.
     2.5.3. The AIB president is the focal point for family requests to visit the mishap site, however the
     approval authority and scheduling of the site visit rests with the designated On-Scene Commander
     (OSC) and the convening authority. Any visit to the accident site must be conducted after the recovery
     process has been completed. (NOTE: search and recovery activities must be complete and safety
     investigation activities suspended during all such visits to avoid inadvertent compromise of privi-
     leged, limited-use information or deliberations.
     2.5.4. Consult Attachment 9 of this instruction for a further discussion of the AIB process. For
     detailed guidance, refer to AFI 51-503 or consult the convening MAJCOM/JA as appropriate; contact
     AFLSA/JACT, DSN 426-9055, directly if necessary.

2.6. The Family Support Center (FSC):
     2.6.1. AFI 36-3009, Family Support Center Program, explains the FSC’s mission and responsibili-
     ties. While assisting families following a mishap-related loss is not one of the FSC’s explicit charters,
     such activities fall under the FSC core activity of “crisis assistance,” which the governing directive
     defines as giving “immediate, short-term support and long-term follow-up and referral to help individ-
     uals and families with challenging life situations.” Active duty Family Support Centers ensure
     host-tenant support agreements with collocated Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard
     units provide for comprehensive support of those units in all FSC processes prescribed under this
     instruction. Active duty Family Support Centers conclude Memoranda of Agreement with geograph-
     ically separated Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units to provide family-oriented crisis
     assistance consistent with local capabilities and staffing.
     2.6.2. Commanders should ensure that their installation FSC’s “family readiness” programs are
     appropriately structured to address the possibility of unexpected loss of life in the line of duty, and that
     members are regularly advised to keep their legal affairs in order. Commanders should also ensure
     that Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members of the Total Force are fully aware that bene-
     fits for their survivors may vary depending upon the status of the member at the time of the mishap.
     For example, members performing flying operations or other aviation-related operations involving
     hazardous duty or incentive pay (pararescue specialist, “flying crew chief,” etc.) may be entitled to
     special benefits.
     2.6.3. Base-level Family Support Centers may establish contingency “Family Assistance Centers”
     (FAC) following major mishaps to coordinate family-oriented activities. If established, this capability
     will be included in local disaster response plans and exercised at least annually, preferably in conjunc-
     tion with a Major Accident Response Exercise (MARE). Pre-planning must include: responsibilities
     of FSC and supporting base personnel in activating and staffing the FAC; designated facilities for FAC
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                         19


   operations, including communications and supply requirements; augmentee sources for 24-hour or
   mass casualty operations.
   2.6.3. (ANG) Air National Guard Wing Family Program Coordinators function as Family Assistance
   Centers (FACs) providing FAC services, support, information and referral to members/families of any
   branch of military service. Likewise, National Guard FACs serve any member/family of the Air or
   Army National Guard along with those from any branch of service. Based on existing requirements
   (peace time vs wartime) there are between 162-464 FACs operating nationwide at any given time.
   2.6.4. Family Support Center staffs represent stable sources of corporate knowledge about their base
   and local communities which should be drawn upon by FLOs whenever needed. Each FSC Director
   and Staff Information and Referral Specialist should be responsive to any real-time requests for assis-
   tance outside the expertise of the FLO and other entitlements experts described in this chapter. Other
   base personnel, such as casualty assistance representatives and mortuary affairs officers (see below),
   may also benefit from their supporting FSC’s collection of support and service information in the
   completion of their assigned family assistance tasks.
   2.6.5. Commanders should include the FSC as a key resource in ensuring effective support to fami-
   lies. FSC’s are key to providing a wide range of support for surviving family members.

2.7. The Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR):
   2.7.1. The Casualty Assistance Representative is designated in accordance with AFI 36-3002, Casu-
   alty Services, which is the single source document for casualty notification and assistance, which may
   be available to the survivors of persons lost in Air Force aviation mishaps. In the context of this
   instruction, the CAR may be expected to carry out the following key responsibilities: transmit casu-
   alty reports to the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), the Defense Finance and Accounting Service,
   and other concerned agencies; brief Casualty Notification Officers on their duties and responsibilities;
   and assist the next-of-kin or other eligible beneficiaries in claiming all government benefits and enti-
   tlements.
      2.7.1.1. All three of these tasks have a direct bearing on the Air Force’s successful discharge of its
      obligations to the families of Air Force casualties and require close coordination between the
      CAR, the base mortuary affairs officer (see below), and the FLO to accomplish assigned tasks in a
      manner consistent with objectives of this instruction. To gain perspective on the scope of the chal-
      lenge sometimes faced in this context, commanders are encouraged to examine AFI 36-3002,
      Tables 1.1 and 1.2 (“Casualty Services”), that lists the broad spectrum of persons who could
      potentially become involved in an Air Force mishap.
   2.7.2. Air Force Reserve Command has four full-time casualty assistance representatives, located in
   Pittsburgh PA and Minneapolis MN and at Dobbins AFB GA and Westover AFS MA. Reserve units
   which are tenants on active duty bases provide casualty assistance representatives to their servicing
   Military Personnel Flights (MPF), but their responsibilities are limited and vary from one installation
   to another. Commanders should consult Host-Tenant Support Agreements, Memoranda of Under-
   standing associated with MPF activities, and Casualty Services supplements as appropriate for details.
   2.7.2. (ANG) The Air National Guard has two full-time Casualty Advisors located at the National
   Guard Bureau (NGB/A1POF) and each wing has a Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR) located
   in the MPF.

     2.7.3. The Air Force Casualty Services Branch, located at the Air Force Personnel Center, is manned
     24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist commanders, CARs, and others who require support in fulfill-
     ing their casualty duties and responsibilities. Their toll-free telephone is (800) 433-0048.

2.8. The Mortuary Affairs Officer :
     2.8.1. The base mortuary affairs officer is appointed by the installation commander in accordance
     with AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program. The base mortuary affairs officer is the base Services
     commander, director, or deputy who administers and executes the program for the installation com-
     mander. The base mortuary affairs officer is specifically prohibited from being assigned to casualty
     notification or family liaison officer duty.
     2.8.2. The base mortuary affairs officer oversees the administration of the survivor assistance pro-
     gram for the installation commander and will:
        2.8.2.1. Promote survivor assistance awareness.
        2.8.2.2. Facilitate FLO training.
        2.8.2.3. Maintain contact with FLOs throughout the casualty process and report status/issues/
        progress, etc to MAJCOM POC as required.
        2.8.2.4. Obtain FLO logs and incorporate into mortuary case files (when a mortuary case file is
        opened).
        2.8.2.5. Remind units that have lost members about the one-year anniversary condolence letters
        and assist if necessary. Reminders will come from HQ USAF/ILV via MAJCOM SVs.
        2.8.2.6. Obtain a copy of one-year anniversary condolence letters and file in mortuary case files.
     2.8.3. Other mortuary functions are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6 of this publication.
     2.8.4. (Added-ANG) The Base Mortuary Affairs Officer or Base Prime RIBS Manager is responsible
     to provide the information at Attachment 15 (Added), Air National Guard Mortuary Affairs Case
     File Worksheet, to the Air National Guard Services Division / Survivors Assistance Office (NGB/
     A1S) within 24 hours after the discovery of the mishap/incident/death of the ANG member. Attach-
     ment 15 (Added) may be copied or taken electronically off the NGB/A1S website.

2.9. The Critical Incident Stress Team (CIST):
     2.9.1. The Critical Incident Stress Team is assembled in accordance with AFI 44-153, Critical Inci-
     dent Stress Management (CISM). As a minimum, membership should include expertise in four key
     areas: medical (typically a physician) and; mental health practitioner; chaplain and chaplain service
     support; personnel; and family support center personnel.
     2.9.2. CISM represents an integrated, comprehensive, multi-component crisis intervention system
     which is designed to prevent or mitigate the impact of a critical incident on affected personnel and to
     accelerate recovery in people who are experiencing normal signs, symptoms and reactions to totally
     abnormal events. CISM interventions span the entire life of crises, to include actions before a crisis
     occurs, during the acute phase of the crisis, and into the post-crisis phase. These interventions can be
     applied with individuals, small or large groups, families, organizations and communities. The core
     components of CISM are:
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                            21


      2.9.2.1. Pre-crisis preparation. This includes an educational approach in which individuals and
      organizations are trained in areas such as stress resistance, stress management, and crisis mitiga-
      tion. It is designed to help participants know what to do in times in which individual resources for
      coping with stress are challenged to their fullest.
      2.9.2.2. Support programs at the family, unit, and community level. These services include
      efforts to keep affected parties informed through venues such as informational briefings and
      “town meetings,” as well as services to individuals who have served in various roles as disaster
      workers (e.g., firefighters, security forces, medics, remains handlers, investigators, community
      leaders). The latter includes both consultation and a process referred to as “demobilization.”
      Demobilizations are short educational or supportive interactions.
   2.9.3. The CIST will be involved in a wide range of services for families, aircrew, search and recov-
   ery teams, disaster workers, and the local community experiencing the traumatic event. The team can
   quickly be over-extended if the disaster involves large numbers of victims or if circumstances other-
   wise drive wide-spread community needs. AFI 44-153, Critical Incident Stress Management, outlines
   procedures for requesting additional CIST support in the event that a wing commander determines
   that her or she does not have the necessary CISM resources to manage the disaster.
   2.9.4. The specific type of CISM intervention with the spouse and/or family will be determined by
   the CIST Chief after a CIST member’s initial contact (defusing) with the family. This initial contact
   will generally occur shortly after the family’s notification of the loss. Individual or family crisis inter-
   vention may be warranted, but should never be intrusive or forced upon family members.
   2.9.5. If a FLO has not already been appointed at the time the family is first contacted by the CIST,
   the CIST should provide an avenue for smooth transfer of support from the casualty notification pro-
   cess into the family liaison and long-term information flow/support processes prescribed by this
   instruction. Close cooperation between CIST members and the FLO can facilitate disengagement
   either of the CIST or acceptance of the FLO.
   2.9.6. Commanders should use CIST resources for CISM interventions (especially defusings,
   debriefings, and demobilizations) for themselves, unit personnel, search and recovery team members
   and others involved in the community response. Particular attention should be given to FLOs
   throughout the period during which they have regular and frequent contact with the survivors. Com-
   manders should consult with their CIST Chief for further advice and recommendations.

2.10. Military Chaplains and Chaplain Service Support Personnel:
   2.10.1. General Responsibilities. Per AFI 52-101, Chaplain Service Responsibilities and Procedures,
   the nearest military chaplain, regardless of service affiliation or denomination, may be asked to pro-
   vide initial support to next-of-kin or family members following the notification of a service member’s
   loss. In addition, Chaplains are typically an integral part of the casualty notification team. Chaplains
   and Chaplain Service Support Personnel are part of the critical incident stress management teams as
   described above.
   2.10.1. (ANG) General Responsibilities. Per AFI 52-101, Chaplain Service Responsibilities and Pro-
   cedures, if Air National Guard chaplains are not available, the nearest military chaplain, regardless of
   service affiliation or denomination, may be asked to provide initial support to next-of-kin or family
   members following the notification of a service member’s loss. Traditional Air National Guard chap-
   lains should make every effort to provide support for next-of-kin or family members, as well as unit
22                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     members, and should be placed on orders when providing such support. ANG chaplains should be an
     integral part of the casualty notification team. Chaplains and chaplain assistants are part of the stress
     management support response, assisting medical personnel in providing Critical Incident Stress Man-
     agement (CISM) or equivalent stress management support.
     2.10.2. Memorial Services. Chaplains are available to assist commanders and family members in
     planning and performing funeral or memorial services. In some circumstances, they may also advise
     commanders in planning appropriate services for those other than family who are affected by the loss,
     such as squadron personnel, search and recovery team members, or other installation or community
     members.
     2.10.3. Ministry to Providers. Chaplains provide pastoral care to all personnel who provide assis-
     tance to the families who have suffered losses. Additionally, they usually serve as a part of the Disas-
     ter Response Force (see AFMAN 32-4004) to be available at the scene of a major mishap as needed.
     2.10.3. (ANG) Ministry to Providers. Chaplains provide pastoral care to all personnel who provide
     assistance to the families who have suffered losses. Additionally, they usually serve as a part of the
     Disaster Response Force (see AFMAN 32-4004) to be available at the scene of a major mishap as
     needed. ANG Chaplains play an integral part in providing stress management for all personnel
     responding to a fatality, especially for the casualty notification team.
     2.10.4. (Added-ANG) Ministry to Families. Air National Guard (ANG) chaplains are available to
     provide comfort, counseling and religious support to families and friends of ANG personnel who have
     died whether or not the deceased was on active duty at the time of death. This support is provided at
     the wishes of the family and friends of the deceased and with the permission of the Commander. ANG
     chaplains work closely with family support in ascertaining needs of the family and organizing unit
     personnel in providing assistance where possible.
     2.10.5. (Added-ANG) Ministry for Traumatic Death. ANG chaplain services will be made available
     in response to all traumatic mishaps such as air crashes, suicides, mass fatalities, and natural or tech-
     nological disasters that involve loss of life or major injury. ANG chaplains can serve as trauma
     response consultants to unit leaders to determine what level of service, if any, is needed. ANG chap-
     lains can provide screening, education, psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to poten-
     tially traumatic events. The services provided will vary depending on the nature of the mishap and the
     needs of the squadrons involved in the mishap. In general, the commander of any unit that incurs loss
     of personnel or significant injury to personnel as a result of a mishap should consult with the Wing
     Chaplain to determine what chaplain support services may be needed.

2.11. The Office of Survivor Assistance (AF/ILV). The Office of Survivor Assistance consists of the
Director of Services (AF/ILV), permanent staff (AF/ILVQ), and Survivor Crisis Action Team (SCAT)
members. When the SCAT is activated, the Director of Services reports directly to the Assistant Vice
Chief of Staff of the Air Force. AF/ILV:
     2.11.1. Serves as the Headquarters Air Force focal point for all issues related to the survivors of per-
     sons lost in Air Force aviation mishaps.
     2.11.2. Is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for this instruction.
     2.11.3. Is notified of all fatal mishaps by the Air Force Operations Center, carrying out all procedures
     described in Attachment 2 of this instruction as appropriate.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        23


   2.11.4. Determines the likely level of effort required to ensure all family needs for information and
   services are fully addressed.
   2.11.5. Appoints HQ USAF level family liaison officers when warranted.
   2.11.6. Receives summaries of investigation information as they are produced by MAJCOM POC
   (see paragraph 5.4.3.6.).
   2.11.7. Receives and serves as a central clearinghouse for all correspondence received from families
   by HQ USAF staff and agencies, including Congressional and media inquiries, for tasking, follow-up,
   and consolidated response except when such responses are required by law to be prepared by other Air
   Force organizations, e.g. requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
   (Informational copies of all responses to family FOIA requests related to survivor assistance issues
   described in this instruction, minus attachments, are sent to AF/ILV for inclusion in survivor assis-
   tance case files.) Performs other functions as described in Chapter 10 of this instruction.

2.12. Legal Assistance
   2.12.1. General Responsibilities. Military legal assistance attorneys shall provide advice and ser-
   vices to eligible next-of-kin and other eligible family members in accordance with AFI 51-504, Legal
   Assistance, Notary, and Preventive Law Programs.
   2.12.2. Legal Assistance to Otherwise Ineligible Next-of-Kin and Family Members. The nearest
   military legal assistance program may be asked to provide initial support to next-of-kin or family
   members following the notification of a service member’s death or incapacitation. Some of these
   individuals may not meet eligibility criteria for military legal assistance. When it benefits the com-
   mand, however, the staff judge advocate of the military legal assistance program may authorize his or
   her attorneys to provide these otherwise ineligible individuals with advice on personal, civil legal
   problems that arise from the service member’s death. The staff judge advocate will determine the lim-
   its of any legal assistance authorized under this paragraph. Military legal assistance attorneys provid-
   ing advice and service under this paragraph shall do so in accordance with AFI 51-504.
   2.12.3. (Added-ANG) Dependents, family members and the next-of-kin sometimes have legal ques-
   tions and may mention them to the FLO or other key personnel providing services and information.
   FLOs should bring family members and the next-of-kin, with legal questions, to the local ANG unit
   Staff Judge Advocate, who will determine the limits of legal assistance authorized. If the local ANG
   unit Staff Judge Advocate cannot be contacted, check with another ANG unit Staff Judge Advocate in
   the same state.

2.13. Other Service Providers:
   2.13.1. General Considerations:
      2.13.1.1. No single agency can meet the complex needs of families following a mishap. How-
      ever, such situations can be anticipated and provided for in advance if partnerships and formal
      relationships with potential supplemental sources of support are forged before a crisis develops.
      Various sources of augmentation, information and outreach are available to aid families affected
      by a nearby accident, the communities where persons lost in a major accident resided or called
      home, and many others who potentially may require information and assistance beyond the
      resources of the Air Force.
24                                                           AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


        2.13.1.2. Where statutory relationships and responsibilities for support and information do not
        exist, HQ USAF, the major commands, and local commanders and FSC advisors are to develop
        appropriate contacts and formal relationships as necessary to arrange, validate, and exercise these
        capabilities. (National private or quasi-official organizations will be contacted by HQ USAF only
        for this purpose.) However, all such agreements must include specific service tracking and
        accounting procedures, along with detailed reimbursement plans.
     2.13.2. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB):
        2.13.2.1. If an Air Force member or civilian is lost in an aviation mishap under circumstances
        where the NTSB has investigative responsibility (49 CFR 800), the NTSB’s “Family Assistance
        Plan” will be executed first as prescribed by the “Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of
        1996.” (Examples of losses of this type would be accidents involving contract air carriers or
        United Nations (UN) aircraft transporting USAF personnel on peacekeeping or humanitarian
        operations, or accidents involving both civil and Air Force aircraft.)
        2.13.2.2. Once the NTSB has made its required notifications and offers of assistance, the provi-
        sions of this instruction will be carried out.
        2.13.2.3. The families of Air Force members who are lost in civil aviation accidents without Air
        Force aircraft involvement are entitled to all of the benefits and support described in this instruc-
        tion; however, the NTSB controls all information flow from their investigations (see paragraph
        8.4.). Wing/installation commanders should appoint family liaison officers to help families fol-
        lowing non-Air Force aviation accidents.
     2.13.3. The American Red Cross (ARC). The ARC has a long history of service to military members
     in times of need. It assists the Armed Forces in programs related to health, welfare, recreation, and
     morale of military personnel and their families. In keeping with the 1905 Act of Congress, the Red
     Cross provides emergency communications services, humanitarian relief, and other social services to
     members of the Armed Forces and their family members, in peace or war, within or outside the terri-
     torial limits of the United States. Our relationships are defined through DoD Directive 1330.5, Amer-
     ican National Red Cross, and AFI 36-3105, Red Cross Activities Within the Air Force.
     2.13.4. Public Health Service. The United States Public Health Service may become involved in an
     Air Force mishap involving mass casualties for the purposes of augmenting triage and primary care
     resources and preventing post-mishap casualties resulting from airborne or waterborne infectious
     agents. Public Health Service physicians also provide medical care to residents of Native American
     reservations. While Public Health Service personnel are unlikely to come into direct contact with
     families of casualties except in the administration of initial aid, they represent a valuable resource
     which could free local Air Force health care providers for other family-related duties (CIST, etc.).
     2.13.5. The Air Force Aid Society (AFAS). The AFAS is the official charity of the Air Force. Its
     activities are managed at base level by the Family Support Center, and it works closely with the Amer-
     ican Red Cross. Grants or interest-free loans may be available through AFAS to help defray emer-
     gency travel or funeral expenses. NOTE: the Air Force Aid Society’s ability to support Air Force
     Reserve and Air National Guard needs is limited by its charter.
     2.13.6. Private Organizations. Recent years have seen the growth of private organizations, such as
     the “Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors” (TAPS); “Gold Star Wives of America” (for widows
     of deceased service members); “Compassionate Friends” (for grieving parents); “Family Service
     America” (for general social service information), and others. All are geared toward providing or
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                   25


  locating grief counseling and mutual support resources. While the Department of the Air Force may
  not endorse such organizations, which are not specifically provided for by statute (such as the Red
  Cross), commanders will facilitate any family requests to be put in contact with such organizations.
26                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


                                                 Chapter 3

              TRAINING FOR COMMANDERS AND FAMILY LIAISON OFFICERS

3.1. Responsible Organizations. All training will be conducted in accordance with this instruction as
follows:
     3.1.1. For prospective wing and group commanders, the Ira C. Eaker College for Professional Devel-
     opment (CPD) is responsible for training prior to taking command; MAJCOMs supplement that train-
     ing as needed. AF/ILV provides trainers and prepares course content.
     3.1.2. Unit commander training is conducted by MAJCOM/SVs in conjunction with other training
     conducted prior to taking command. (Exception: ARC Commanders may receive training after taking
     command).
     3.1.3. Family liaison officers are trained locally by the Services Squadron or Services Division based
     on MAJCOM and local requirements. (ARC appointed FLOs may also be involved in this training).
     The Services Squadron or Division will schedule and facilitate FLO training. Local support agencies
     (personnel, transportation, medical, legal, and others) will assist by providing their block of training,
     particularly on services that they may provide to primary and secondary next of kin.
     3.1.4. Services Squadrons/Divisions will facilitate annual awareness training to wing leadership,
     group and squadron commanders, and first sergeants.

3.2. Content. AF/ILV and CPD develop appropriate modules for wing and group commander training,
and MAJCOMs, in conjunction with AF/ILV, develop lesson plans for unit commander and family liaison
officer training. All formal training and self-study in the provisions of this instruction should emphasize
the following key areas:
     3.2.1. Information Flow. As stated in AFPD 34-11, Service to Survivors, “The first priority of all
     commanders in dealing with next-of-kin and family members following a member’s death is timely,
     compassionate communication.” The AFSAP must be responsive to the information needs of the
     families it is chartered to serve. These needs come in three broad categories: 1) Information about the
     person’s loss and the ensuing investigation; 2) Information about the benefits and support activities
     available to survivors; and 3) Any other information the bereaved considers important.
     3.2.2. In all cases, accuracy, reliability, and harmony among all information providers are paramount.
     Persons inquiring about specific information must receive the same information or the same guidance
     from all Air Force sources, regardless of which they ask. This is a daunting challenge in a complex
     and inherently hierarchical organization like the Air Force, but is essential to the credibility of the
     information itself. FLOs must be trained to understand the nature of the expertise that the various
     functional specialists can bring to families without trying to become “experts” themselves, and to seek
     out the right experts for thorough answers to any specific questions families might raise or assistance
     they might need.
     3.2.3. Coordination of Support. Prior to development of the AFPD 34-11 family of instructions, a
     variety of functions offered various post-fatality support programs, but they all operated in isolation.
     The Air Force Survivor Assistance Program is intended to integrate all of these programs so as to meet
     the needs of families as seamlessly as possible. Therefore, commanders and prospective family liai-
     son officers must be trained to: 1) remain continuously engaged with all information providers; 2)
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          27


   ensure necessary information is available when it is most likely to be needed; and 3) prevent intrusive
   or repetitive interactions with family members by multiple agencies, while ensuring all necessary con-
   tacts are made as quickly and conveniently as possible.

3.3. Target Audiences and Timing for Initial Training:
   3.3.1. Wing/installation and geographically separated group commanders should be trained on the
   provisions of this instruction prior to assuming command, preferably in conjunction with their respec-
   tive formal courses of instruction at Air University.
   3.3.2. Squadron and geographically separated flight commanders should be trained on the provisions
   of this instruction by MAJCOMs prior to taking command.
   3.3.2. (ANG) Though the Air National Guard does not have a mandatory Squadron Commanders
   course required before taking command, Survivors Assistance Training (FLO and mortuary) will be
   conducted for senior leaders at the Commander Development Course and at every available opportu-
   nity for Squadron Commanders at Intermediate Developmental Courses.
   3.3.3. Prospective family liaison officers should be identified by unit commanders as soon as practi-
   cal after the prospective FLO’s arrival in the unit.
       3.3.3.1. Selection for training should be on the basis of demonstrated maturity, in numbers and at
       pay grades commensurate with the unit’s mission, composition, and frequency of deployments or
       off-station TDYs.
       3.3.3.2. Only volunteers should be trained as FLOs, however, FLOs will be appointed if sufficient
       volunteers cannot be found.
       3.3.3.3. Timing of initial family liaison officer training is at the discretion of each wing/installa-
       tion commander; however, pre-need training is strongly recommended.

3.4. Refresher and Just-in-Time (JIT) Training:
3.4. (ANG) All ANG units have an Annual Survivor Assistance Program (SAP) training and monthly
FLO reporting requirement. Training and reporting requirements are the responsibility of the Services
Commander or NCOIC (GSU’s), regardless of unit size, composition, or mission (i.e., Wings, GSU’s,
CRTC's, etc.). Unit monthly reporting by Services is facilitated through the FLO reporting portal website
at https://airguard.ang.af.mil/c4/c4i/c4iw/ornes/FLOProject/
   3.4.1. Refresher training for wing/group commanders is at the discretion of the MAJCOM/CC.
   3.4.2. Refresher training for unit commanders should be accomplished not later than 1 year after ini-
   tial training and annually thereafter until they are reassigned. It may be conducted through self-paced
   study, computer-based training, or other media at the discretion of the MAJCOM/CC. Refresher
   training should be taken advantage of as an opportunity to update names, phone numbers, and contact
   procedures for all support activities against possible future need.
   3.4.3. Refresher training for designated family liaison officers is at the discretion of individual wing/
   installation commanders.
   3.4.3. (ANG) Family Liaison Officer refresher training will be conducted annually; however, a
   monthly update is required through the NGB/A1S website (see paragraph 3.4.) to ensure required lev-
   els of FLO staffing is maintained to meet the needs of the Units. Just-in-Time (JIT) Training for FLO’s
28                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     will occur within 24 hours of appointment, and before initial contact with the Next of Kin and other
     family members. Services units are encouraged to print and file a “print screen” shot of their monthly
     FLO reporting update.
     3.4.4. JIT training is required for family liaison officers. However, family contact should not be
     delayed to facilitate JIT training. Wing/installation commanders assess each designated FLO’s readi-
     ness to perform their assigned duties when determining the need for JIT training prior to initial con-
     tact.

3.5. Format of Training Sessions. Both initial and refresher training may be conducted in conjunction
with simulated notifications and support scenarios associated with Major Accident Response Exercises
(MARE). In addition, training sessions will be organized as follows:
     3.5.1. All initial and refresher training will: ensure each attendee has a current personal copy of this
     instruction; emphasize the key principles of information flow and coordination of support; include a
     case study exercise, which incorporates challenges related to both key principles. Example: crash in
     an inaccessible area (poor communications with investigators) and a divorced parent as NOK (poten-
     tial for alienation or failure to include other parent).
     3.5.2. All refresher and just-in-time training will: be conducted with direct reference to this instruc-
     tion and other source documents as appropriate; reiterate the key principles of information flow and
     coordination of support; describe in detail the MAJCOM’s established process for information flow
     from investigations to families and the public; review the critical incident stress defusing and debrief-
     ing processes; explain the stages of grief people typically pass through following a sudden loss;
     review procedures for identifying the need for mental health referral, insure training focuses on the
     support that other base organizations can provide to families in crisis.
     3.5.3. Wing leadership is encouraged to provide opening and closing remarks at FLO training to dem-
     onstrate its importance.

                         CASUALTY NOTIFICATION/INITIAL CONTACT

4.1. Source Document and General Information:
   4.1.1. AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, contains all information required to carry out initial notifica-
   tion in an appropriate manner. Commanders should consult Attachment 16 of that instruction (“Casu-
   alty Notification Officer Checklist”) for a useful synopsis of the notification process. It is critical for
   commanders to recognize that AFI 36-3002 provides a generic strategy, which can be used, for any
   notification, regardless of the circumstances of the death or other casualty being reported.
   4.1.2. Persons outside the Air Force may obtain information about an Air Force mishap and attempt
   to reach families before official notification can take place. In the face of this new reality, command-
   ers must make every effort to expedite casualty notification consistent with the need for accurate, con-
   firmed information. (See paragraph 4.11. for an expanded discussion of media relations in
   conjunction with family interactions.)
   4.1.3. In the wake of a person’s loss in an Air Force mishap, a commander’s personal involvement
   from the very beginning maximizes the likelihood of providing the most satisfactory and helpful sup-
   port and information flow to those who need it. Therefore, unless it is physically impossible for com-
   manders to make post-mishap casualty notifications personally, they must make every effort to do so.

4.2. The Notification Team. Forethought in assembling the notification team is important. Consider
such factors as time of day, the possible presence of children, potential language or cultural challenges (in
the case of foreign-born spouses) and other variables which might dictate specific team members or addi-
tional help which might be needed.

4.3. Commanders’ Readiness to Make Casualty Notifications:
   4.3.1. Commanders should review this instruction prior to making casualty notifications.
   4.3.2. Commanders should have personal information on each member of their units, including civil-
   ian employees, immediately available to aid in providing successful support to families after a fatal
   mishap. To this end, commanders must encourage members to keep their DD Forms 93, Record of
   Emergency Data, up to date; civilian employees must be encouraged to regularly review and update
   Part A of their AF Forms 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief (AF Form 971 NAF for nonappropriated
   fund employees). Since ARC personnel frequently reside in a different location than where their unit
   is located, information of this type is essential for commanders of Air Force Reserve Command and
   Air National Guard organizations. Commanders may also prepare detailed personal data cards on all
   military and civilian unit personnel. Bear in mind that supplementary cards will only be as useful as
   they are current, so commanders must establish and enforce a rigorous update system should they
   decide to use them to aid in assisting families. Supplemental data cards must include a Privacy Act
   Statement that must be maintained within an existing system of records (such as with the DD Form
   93).
30                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     4.3.3. Information, which is useful in times of emergency, includes: 1) Names and ages of depen-
     dents/family living in the local area; 2) Phone numbers of family members (local and long distance);
     3) Religious preference; 4) Special needs or conditions (dependent parent in home, disabled child or
     spouse, etc.); 5) Detailed directions to the home (with hand-drawn map); 7) Specific instructions
     made in advance by the deceased individual regarding his/her family notification preferences, such as
     contact information for a particular person to make the notification or have present during or after the
     casualty notification is made; 8) Information on family members or friends other than those indicated
     on the DD Form 93/ AF Form 971 who the military member or civilian employee would like to have
     notified in the event of their death or serious injury.
     4.3.4. Given the sensitivity of some of this above information, supplemental data cards should be
     used in case of emergency only, and should be destroyed upon permanent departure of the persons to
     whom they pertain. This information is not to be used as a substitute for a “social roster” or other
     unofficial product, nor should it be available to anyone other than supervisors who might reasonably
     be expected to make a casualty notification in the commander’s absence.

4.4. Survivors’ Readiness and Ability to Receive Information:
     4.4.1. People vary widely in their ability to deal with traumatic events. Some withdraw, others
     become highly emotional, while still others may initially try to manage their shock and grief by
     becoming matter-of-fact, businesslike, curt, or brusque. However, few will have the capacity to
     absorb and digest much information beyond the fact of the loss itself. The initial casualty notification
     is not the time to provide vast amounts of information, regardless of its usefulness, simply because it
     will be neither understood nor internalized. Commanders and FLOs must be sensitive to the stages of
     grieving through which the family members are passing at any given time.
     4.4.2. Limit initial information flow to those details which require near-term decisions or actions.
     4.4.3. While voluntarily provided information should be offered with due consideration for the above
     guidelines, requests for information must be responded to as quickly as possible. It is impossible to
     predict what will or will not be important to the families of persons who have died suddenly, but it is
     essential to establish and cultivate a climate of full and open communication from the moment of ini-
     tial notification onward. Therefore, during initial notification and preliminary FLO contacts, com-
     manders and FLOs will treat all questions as valid and make every effort to get them answered by the
     appropriate subject matter experts as quickly as possible.
     4.4.4. From the moment of casualty notification onward, information regarding the facts and circum-
     stances surrounding the mishap will become available. To the extent legally permitted, Commanders
     and FLOs will provide all information as it becomes available (see Chapter 5).
     4.4.5. Examples of questions and appropriate responses:
        4.4.5.1. If asked direct questions about the mishap itself, it is perfectly acceptable to say, “I don’t
        know” and then explain the investigation process. It is not acceptable to say “We can talk about
        that later,” but neither is it acceptable to engage in supposition about the circumstances surround-
        ing the mishap. Stress that the Air Force will provide regular updates on the progress of the inves-
        tigation, and that any questions the family has will be answered as fully as possible, as soon as
        possible.
        4.4.5.2. If asked questions about funeral arrangements or entitlements, consult available subject
        matter experts and get an answer immediately from AF Mortuary at 800-531-5803. If the appro-
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                           31


       priate expert is not immediately available, you may simply respond by saying, “I don’t have that
       information with me, but let’s make a list of everything you’d like to know about that, and I’ll find
       the right person to get you those answers as quickly as I can.”
       4.4.5.3. If asked questions about the condition, disposition, or location of the deceased person’s
       remains, you must be truthful, but you needn’t be graphic. If directly pressed for an answer which
       would undoubtedly be distressing, such as in the case of a catastrophic, destructive crash, simply
       say, “I’d better let one of our flight surgeons discuss that with you.”
   4.4.6. Commanders and FLOs must never speculate, but must always be as forthright as possible.
   Some subjects will be as unpleasant to explore as they are for the families to inquire about, but they
   must never be deferred.

4.5. Information to Be Provided Immediately:
   4.5.1. The basis upon which the decision has been made to advise the family of the loss (positive
   identification, reasonable certainty, missing or overdue aircraft, etc.).
   4.5.2. How to contact the deceased's unit commander. Explain briefly the purpose of the assigned
   Family Liaison Officer and that they will be contacting the family shortly.
   4.5.3. The roles of Air Force casualty assistance representatives, mortuary affairs officers, and other
   assistance providers.
   4.5.4. The role of the Family Liaison Officer in facilitating information flow regarding both the loss
   itself and available services.
   4.5.5. The Air Force’s willingness to make other notifications (to other family members, a close
   friend, a relative, or a clergy member) to provide immediate support and comfort to the immediate
   family.

4.6. Matters to Avoid During Initial Notification. It will not be productive to discuss the following
information during the initial notification: Insurance payments and arrears of pay; mortuary affairs mat-
ters (which will handled separately by the mortuary affairs representative); specific questions regarding
line of duty, neglect, errors of judgment, or the responsibility of others involved in the mishap; prior expe-
riences or personal conjecture regarding the person’s loss; or any other subject the person making the noti-
fication is not qualified to address.

4.7. Matters Not to be Discussed During Any Visits: Safety investigation board information deter-
mined to be privileged in accordance with AFI 91-204, paragraph 1.13; theories of potential legal liabil-
ity; assignment of blame, whether it is to an individual, an organization, or the Air Force itself.

4.8. Missing and Overdue Aircraft:
   4.8.1. Since 1990, there has only been one Air Force aircraft -- with two occupants -- which has never
   been found. However, given the global mission and increasingly expeditionary nature of Air Force
   operations, such a possibility cannot be discounted in the future. Whenever an aircraft goes unre-
   ported, there is always a chance that its occupants have survived but are temporarily out of contact.
   Large aircraft are often capable of surviving forced landings, and modern tactical aircraft have highly
   effective egress systems. However, the efficiency of contemporary communication systems and satel-
32                                                             AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     lite-based emergency locator transmitter (ELT) tracking capabilities makes prolonged lack of contact
     a matter of grave concern.
     4.8.2. Families of persons who are “Duty Status -- Whereabouts Unknown” (DUSTWUN) typically
     hold expectations for a favorable outcome for a considerable period of time. However, they also need
     realistic appraisals of the situation from the chain of command. The significance of visual sightings
     of smoke or debris, information from ELT alerts, and other indicators need to be presented to the fam-
     ilies as they become available, particularly if validation of such indicators will require a separate, pro-
     tracted effort.
     4.8.3. Since “investigations” do not typically start while search and rescue operations are still in
     progress, it is up to the commander to ensure that regular progress reports regarding the search are
     passed along to the families of the missing until either the search is suspended or investigations com-
     mence. This is critical to the credibility of subsequent information flow efforts.

4.9. The Search and Recovery (S&R) Process:
     4.9.1. General Description. The S&R process, run by the Services Squadron or Division, is an essen-
     tial part of every disaster response where casualties are known or expected. It consists of a ground
     search in the vicinity of a major mishap, typically conducted by a team of trained individuals; the
     number of persons deployed on an S&R operation is based on the requirements of the mishap situa-
     tion. The purpose of S&R is to locate and recover the remains of victims of the mishap along with any
     personal property, which might help with identification. Recovery of remains is considered as impor-
     tant as the accident investigation itself; however, it is time-sensitive, and valuable investigative infor-
     mation, identification of remains, and mishap clues can easily be destroyed by hasty or incomplete
     recovery actions. Therefore, mortuary affairs officers and S&R teams work closely with the director
     of base medical services or the Safety Investigation Board’s medical officer to ensure remains are
     properly documented as they are found, then expeditiously removed from the scene. In extremely
     destructive mishaps, the victims are subjected to instantaneous, violent forces that make post-crash
     recovery and identification extremely difficult. Air Force directives are specific and graphic with
     respect to how remains are to be recovered and when all such remains may reasonably be expected to
     be recovered. These same directives also make clear the S&R team’s obligation to be as deliberate
     and thorough as possible.
     4.9.2. Special Circumstances. In some cases, the search for the remains of victims of a mishap may
     overlap with investigative activity, such as in cases where an aircraft has impacted terrain or is sub-
     merged in a body of water. Because of the possibility of additional recovery when remains are not
     intact, mortuary affairs officers customarily do not request disposition instructions prior to termina-
     tion of all search operations. However, investigators are sensitive to the possibility of further recovery
     and facilitate temporary resumption of S&R activities or other recovery operations whenever war-
     ranted.
     4.9.3. Termination of S&R:
        4.9.3.1. Search and recovery operations vary widely in the length of time they require based on
        the amount of area to be covered, the nature of the terrain, and the climate. Even after the full
        S&R team has completed its detailed area search, normal procedures require leaving a team leader
        and at least five S&R team members at the scene until the mortuary affairs officer and On-Scene
        Commander determine that the search for both remains and wreckage is complete.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                         33


       4.9.3.2. The mortuary affairs officer or Services Commander or Division Chief, recommends to
       the On-Scene Commander when S&R activities should be formally terminated. Mortuary affairs
       officers normally consult with the Air Force Mortuary Affairs Office, and their MAJCOM/SV,
       prior to making such a recommendation.
       4.9.3.3. Once the decision to end S&R has been made by the appropriate commander, it becomes
       the mortuary affairs officer’s duty to so advise all affected next-of-kin. This duty normally should
       not be delegated to the individual family liaison officers, since the emotional impact of this deter-
       mination is often as profound as that experienced following the initial casualty notification. How-
       ever, if numerous families are involved, installation commanders may ensure prompt notification
       by augmenting the mortuary affairs officer as necessary. Should augmentees be deemed neces-
       sary, the Air Force Mortuary Affairs Office can offer the designated individuals useful advice
       prior to making the end-of-search notification; they may be contacted directly for this purpose at
       the commander’s discretion.

4.10. Dealing with Requests to Visit the Scene of the Mishap:
   4.10.1. Under no circumstances should an immediate offer be made to visit the scene of a major mis-
   hap. However, if the mishap occurred close to their residence, family members may request an
   opportunity to visit the scene, and such requests must be evaluated in light of the circumstances of
   each mishap. Commanders must avoid making any commitment to provide such an opportunity until
   they have had the opportunity to consult with the investigation convening authority, the SIB and AIB
   Presidents, and the On-Scene Commander. Air support to remote locations should be coordinated
   with the MAJCOM/XO.
   4.10.2. Crash sites present very real physical hazards, and the presence of a destroyed aircraft brings
   home the violence of some aviation-related deaths in a way that can cause deep emotional distress.
   However, some theories of grief and coping suggest that such exposure can be beneficial in some
   cases. In some cases, such visits should be deferred until after the scene has been remediated (envi-
   ronmentally restored), or at least until wreckage has been removed; in others, the impact of the scene
   and its attendant destruction may be deliberately sought. Some families may not wish to visit the site
   until a much later time after the accident (1-year anniversary, etc.). Any visits to the crash scene by
   family members should be escorted by wing/installation or unit commanders if at all possible, and
   made with either CIST personnel or medical professionals in attendance. A family liaison officer
   should not be the only chain of command representative during a crash site visit. Commanders should
   consult with their CIST Chief for further advice and recommendations. NOTE: Commanders should
   be prepared for the reactions, which can accompany even such “arms-length” exposure to the scene.
   4.10.3. Visits to a crash site should be strictly limited to family members only. If S&R activities are
   not yet complete, do not allow family members inside the cordon under any circumstances. Ideally, a
   vantagepoint for distant observation should be pre-selected by the On-Scene Commander, and family
   members asked to remain in that immediate area.
   4.10.4. The Air Force will make every effort to transport family members to the scene of an accident
   for the purposes of memorialization, but cannot make a blanket promise to do so. Our global mission
   frequently takes our people and aircraft to inaccessible parts of the world, often under carefully con-
   trolled “diplomatic clearances” granted for mission-related purposes only. (See paragraph 6.5. for
   more information regarding memorial services and activities.)

4.11. CIST Involvement:
     4.11.1. The CIST process anticipates the needs of people who face an unexpected traumatic event.
     This can include everyone from the family who experiences the loss of a loved one to members of the
     involved chain of command, FLOs, search and recovery team members, and even investigators.
     4.11.2. IAW AFI 44-153, CISM services should be provided in response to aircraft mishaps where
     there is loss of life. The CIST will be activated immediately through the Command Post of the base
     called upon to provide an interim Safety Investigation Board (SIB). The CIST Chief will be listed on
     the Command Post required notification list for an aircraft mishap. The Command Post at the base
     incurring the loss of aircraft or personnel will notify the local CIST Chief to activate support for local
     base personnel, regardless of the location of the mishap itself.
     4.11.3. CIST members will be available to provide support and counseling for local surviving family
     members within 12 hours of the family’s initial notification of their loss, at the discretion of the CIST
     Chief. As the acute crisis continues for the family, CIST members will continue to have periodic con-
     tact with the family members to assess their need for and/or to provide other CISM services, as
     needed. CIST contacts with the family members will generally be phased out shortly after the inter-
     ment of the deceased member’s remains.
     4.11.4. The CIST will provide counseling, defusings and debriefings to others directly or indirectly
     impacted by the disaster. Debriefings or counseling will begin within the first 12 hours of the notifi-
     cation of the mishap. Debriefings will follow for individuals directly impacted within 24 to 72 hours.
     Demobilizations will occur with disaster workers during selected shift changes and/or at the termina-
     tion of the disaster work. Similar to defusings or counseling, stress debriefings may be offered to fam-
     ilies, if deemed appropriate by the CIST chief. Individual crisis intervention services will be provided
     to non-family members on a time-available basis.
     4.11.5. Individuals not directly involved with the traumatic event, but experiencing effects from the
     event (such as commanders, colleagues, and CAST members, or perhaps even an entire squadron) will
     be provided Critical Incident Stress Debriefings (CISD) upon request of unit commanders or as an
     open offering IAW AFI 44-153.

4.12. Interaction with Media During and After Initial Notification:
     4.12.1. Initial and Follow-Up Releases on the Mishap:
        4.12.1.1. Within an hour of initial notification of a major mishap, the Air Force public affairs
        office from the installation appointing the interim safety board (or SAF/PA, as appropriate) should
        issue an initial news release containing all available releasable information.
        4.12.1.2. After the initial release, the names of survivors should be released as soon as possible
        unless doing so would reveal the identity of those who were lost before their families can be noti-
        fied. Once all notifications are confirmed to have been completed, the assigned public affairs
        officer (PAO) is to release the names of all persons involved.
        4.12.1.3. After the initial release, coordination of follow-up releases with the On-Scene Com-
        mander and casualty officer, as well as the MAJCOM/SV and AIB president is essential to ensure
        facts released to news media agree with those given the families. The MAJCOM/JA must coordi-
        nate on proposed follow-up releases. See AFI 51-503, Chapter 7, for additional guidance.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        35


  4.12.2. Typical Post-Mishap Information Requirements. General public affairs guidelines contained
  in AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures, set an ambitious benchmark for the amount
  and nature of information which should be made available to the public as soon as practical after fam-
  ily notification. These include: the names of persons killed; each decedent’s home of record; for mil-
  itary members, information that usually could be given out without invasion of an individual's
  privacy, such as, gender; Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC); military grade and rank; base pay and all
  allowances except Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ); current and past assignments; date of rank
  (DOR); extended active duty (EAD) date; pay date; source of commission; Professional Military Edu-
  cation (PME); military awards and decorations; duty status; attendance at technical, scientific, or pro-
  fessional meetings; and, in the case of key personnel previously developed biographies and
  photographs (typically available for senior officers only).
  4.12.3. Personal and Privacy Act-Controlled Information. PAOs are advised by their own directives
  to ensure releases do not invade the personal privacy of the victims or their relatives. Nevertheless, it
  is possible that members of the media may discover the identity of a person or persons who have been
  lost in a mishap very quickly. PAOs will protect the following information to the best of their ability:
  Home address; Home telephone number; Age (date of birth); Marital status; Number and sex of
  dependents; Civilian education, degree, and year of graduation; and Civilian awards.
     4.12.3.1. However, bear in mind that much of this information is readily obtained through tele-
     phone books, the Internet, and previously prepared individual biographies in the public domain.
  4.12.4. Release of Fatality Information Prior to Family Notification:
     4.12.4.1. When a military mishap in a civilian community causes significant property damage or
     civilian loss of life, public affairs directives indicate that wing commanders or their equivalents
     may release the names of members killed in the mishap before their next-of-kin have been noti-
     fied, but only when in the judgment of the commander the needs of the public outweigh any poten-
     tial distress of the victim's next-of-kin. This may be necessary when the commander needs to
     immediately reassure the community that the members were well qualified and experienced, or
     when civilian authorities need information on the members to identify the mishap victims'
     remains. If an immediate release of this type is required, wing/installation commanders will con-
     sider making an immediate telephonic casualty notification to the next-of-kin in lieu of an in-per-
     son notification. NOTE: Telephonic notifications are done by rare exception only and will not be
     routinely accomplished.
     4.12.4.2. A wing/installation commander’s judgment also comes into play in the case of survivors
     of mishaps. Public affairs directives strongly urge release of the names of all survivors as quickly
     as possible unless the severity of their injuries makes their survival doubtful. However, if in the
     judgment of the commander releasing survivors’ names would reveal the identity of deceased
     individuals prior to next-of-kin notification (such as in the case of crew members known by their
     families to customarily fly together), the survivors’ names may be withheld.
  4.12.5. High-Visibility Mishaps. When an active Air Force, Air National Guard (ANG), or Air Force
  Reserve Command (AFRC) (or Civil Air Patrol, if on an Air Force authorized mission) aircraft, space,
  missile, or explosives mishap causes a non-Air Force death or injury, or extensive private property
  damage, media interest rises sharply. Refer to AFI 35-102, Chapter 6 for guidance.

                                                 Chapter 5

                   ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING INFORMATION FLOW

5.1. General Guidelines:
     5.1.1. Information flow following a loss in an Air Force mishap starts with the very first reports on
     that mishap. Both operational and preliminary (8 hour) safety reports must be concise, purely factual,
     and contain no information that is privileged or exempt from release, and is aimed at getting the noti-
     fication and support processes which will follow, off to an effective start.
     5.1.2. All functional areas which receive initial information regarding mishaps and casualties, includ-
     ing operations, safety, medical, casualty affairs, mortuary affairs, and public affairs personnel, must
     share their information promptly and effectively within the restrictions imposed by directives and
     legal requirements. All parties must make a concerted and consistent effort to ensure information
     needed to initiate disaster response, casualty notification, and investigation actions have been received
     by the commanders and functional managers responsible for carrying them out.
     5.1.3. The process explained in this chapter is dependent upon the convening of Air Force safety and
     accident investigation boards as described below. Such boards are typically convened for all Air
     Force aviation mishaps involving loss of life. However, commanders must be alert to the possibility
     that one or both of these processes may be deferred or delayed due to unusual circumstances, and
     remain prepared to take action on their own to initiate and sustain a flow of information to the families
     of those who have died, as effectively as possible under the circumstances.
     5.1.4. If investigations are delayed pending the outcome of search and rescue or salvage operations,
     commanders will ensure they receive regular progress reports from the persons conducting such oper-
     ations and convey them promptly to the affected families. Under these circumstances, mortuary
     affairs officer search and recovery progress reports required under AFMAN 34-243 may be provided
     to the affected families directly or via the FLO at the wing/installation commander’s discretion. Sen-
     sitive information concerning condition of remains should not be released until individual positive
     identification of remains is made. Without exception, the designated mortuary affairs officer must
     personally brief the termination of S&R activities to families.

5.2. The Family Liaison Officer (FLO).
     5.2.1. One member of a unit experiencing a major mishap should be assigned to each family as their
     personal FLO within 24 hours of the loss. This individual should be relieved of all other duties until
     the deceased’s funeral is complete. Individuals selected for FLO duty who have not previously
     received formal training in this instruction per Chapter 3 must do so before making initial contact, if
     at all possible. Persons who may be considered participants in the mishap sequence (e.g., other crew-
     members from the mishap aircraft, members of the mishap aircraft’s formation, maintenance person-
     nel directly responsible for the aircraft, etc.) should not be appointed as FLOs.
     5.2.2. The unit commander should formally introduce the FLO to the family he or she will be assist-
     ing. (This may not be feasible in a mass casualty situation.) From the first meeting on, the FLO
     should never be placed in the position of having to make a personal visit to the family alone unless
     absolutely necessary. Regularly scheduled phone calls may be accomplished without supervision;
     however, personal visits should be in the company of commanders or the various subject matter
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                         37


   experts (casualty assistance representative, mortuary affairs officer, etc.) who have prescribed busi-
   ness to conduct. In all cases, FLOs must perform their duties in a professional manner, bearing in
   mind their dual obligations to the Air Force and the family to which they have been assigned.
   5.2.2. (ANG) Because a significant number of ANG unit commanders are Traditional Guardsmen,
   and therefore not always available, the Services Full-time technician (Base Prime RIBS Manager) will
   coordinate with the affected squadron leadership to determine the appropriate member to introduce
   the FLO to the NOK.
   5.2.3. Once interment has been completed, FLOs must remain readily available to their assigned fam-
   ily and their commander for the balance of the safety and accident investigations to ensure reliable and
   timely flow of information. This does not preclude the conduct of normal mission activity, but FLOs
   should not be sent on deployments or lengthy temporary duty (TDY) trips unless essential to the mis-
   sion. In this event, a suitable replacement must be appointed, ideally in advance of the original FLO’s
   departure date.
   5.2.4. FLOs may elevate family concerns through the chain of command as necessary to ensure their
   resolution. However, in all such cases their guiding principle will be resolution at the lowest level
   practical in the least time possible. This means giving local functional managers the opportunity to
   correct problems before going up-channel, but not accepting undue delay in the process.
   5.2.5. Commanders, service providers, and persons with function-specific expertise will not use
   FLOs as buffers to deliver “bad news” -- denials of requests for information or assistance remain the
   responsibility of the appropriate OPR and will not be delegated to others for explanation.
   5.2.6. Should family liaison officers be reassigned while still in regular contact with a supported fam-
   ily, a thorough outbrief and effective handoff to a suitable replacement is essential.
   5.2.7. Assignment as a FLO, while open-ended at the outset, is not to remain indefinite. Commanders
   must continuously review the frequency and nature of family-to-FLO contacts and develop a plan for
   withdrawing the FLO’s one-on-one support as soon as it is no longer required. The first opportunity
   to consider such a withdrawal would be following the Accident Investigation Board’s outbrief to the
   family. Even after the official duties of the FLO are completed, the FLO may desire to continue to be
   in contact with the family in an unofficial capacity. FLOs should consult the unit commander on the
   appropriate time to terminate official involvement with the family.

5.3. The USAF Survivor Assistance Resource Guide Pamphlet:
   5.3.1. Professionals in the personnel, services, medical, and chaplain specialties have independently
   developed written materials detailing the contributions their functions make to the informational and
   support needs of survivors.
   5.3.2. This pamphlet synopsizes the variety of entitlements and information that will be presented to
   families. It can be used by FLOs and family members to address the most immediate and pressing
   areas families typically have after notification of their loss. The pamphlet includes a listing of avail-
   able resources for families, a resource listing of toll free numbers to call for information and assis-
   tance, and a listing of websites and on-line services for future use.
   5.3.3. The purpose of the pamphlet is to assemble information of value to survivors in an organized
   and coherent manner; ready for use at the time it is needed. Therefore, it interacts with: AFPAM
   34-259, Escorting Deceased Air Force Military Personnel; AFPAM 34-260, Mortuary Services Ben-

     Die While On Active Duty; AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services; AFI 36-3008, Servicemen’s Group Life
     Insurance (SGLI) and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI).
     5.3.4. The Director of Services (AF/ILV and the Air Force Services Agency) are responsible for the
     content and maintenance of the USAF Survivor Assistance Resource Guide. The Deputy Chief of
     Staff, Personnel (AF/DP) and the Air Force Personnel Center are coordinating agencies.

5.4. Information Flow from Air Force Investigations:
     5.4.1. The Relationship Between Air Force Investigations and their Products:
        5.4.1.1. Two separate Air Force investigations are conducted following any fatality resulting from
        an Air Force aviation mishap: The “safety investigation” is conducted first, and is solely focused
        on mishap prevention; since in some cases a similar loss could occur the very next time a given
        aircraft or mission is flown, time is of the essence in a safety investigation. The “accident investi-
        gation” normally follows the safety investigation; since this investigation is required to produce a
        complete, legally sufficient, and publicly releasable report on the loss, it must be conducted delib-
        erately, with proper consideration given to the legal rights of all involved. These processes are
        described in greater detail in Attachment 8 through Attachment 10 and their source documents,
        AFI 91-204 (for safety investigations) and AFI 51-503 (for accident investigations).
        5.4.1.2. Every mishap is a story, which must be reconstructed in detail. Investigation information
        -- facts and updates derived from or related to the progress of both Air Force investigations -- is of
        vital importance to family members who have suffered a loss. The remainder of this chapter
        describes the methodology whereby the families' need for such information is given the priority
        they are due.
     5.4.2. The Information Flow Process:
        5.4.2.1. Due to its time sensitivity and the potential safety and readiness implications of its find-
        ings, the safety investigation process is given primacy in access to evidence, witnesses, and the
        mishap scene itself. For this reason, information flow from investigations has historically been
        centered around the need to accurately convey factual information and documentary evidence
        from the SIB to the AIB. Air Force policy is to ensure that next-of-kin and family members who
        have suffered the loss of a loved one receive as regularly as possible a flow of releasable investi-
        gation information. This is accomplished by using existing mechanisms to the maximum extent
        possible to keep families appropriately informed while protecting the investigative process.
        5.4.2.2. Expeditious turn-around of releasable investigation information is essential to the goals
        and credibility of the AFSAP. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force requires families to be kept
        informed on the progress of accident investigations. MAJCOM commanders will establish appro-
        priate goals for family updates based on the specific circumstances of each mishap and the logisti-
        cal challenges of the investigation that the mishap presents. SIB and AIB presidents will make
        every effort to provide meaningful updates periodically throughout the course of their investiga-
        tions, consistent with the countervailing need to avoid delaying or otherwise interfering with the
        investigations themselves. (See paragraph 5.4.4.1.3. for additional details regarding this goal.)
        5.4.2.3. To ensure its reliability, and to verify that no privileged, limited-use information is inad-
        vertently disclosed, releasable investigation information passes through three stages of handling
        en route to families: 1) From the safety investigation board to the accident investigation board (for
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        39


     continuity and preservation of evidence); 2) From the accident investigation board to the major
     command responsible for convening the investigation (to preserve the chain of command’s statu-
     tory role in validation and dissemination of information); and 3) Down through the chain of com-
     mand to the appropriate commander for transmission to the affected family or families via the
     family liaison officer(s).
     5.4.2.4. Formal information flow conducted under this instruction follows the principle “families
     first.” Public release of investigation information is not addressed in any of the three stages
     described above because public release of such information should not be made ahead of family
     updates. The On-Scene Commander or designated public affairs officer may make preliminary
     releases of general information as described in AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Proce-
     dures, but must stop short of releasing any information which might taint witnesses, prejudice the
     investigations to follow, or tend to lead observers toward any conclusion regarding the cause of
     the mishap. While circumstances may compel exceptions to this general policy (see paragraph
     5.4.5. below), it is always preferable for the Air Force to officially convey releasable investigation
     information to those to whom it has personal importance before it becomes public knowledge. In
     general, public release of information should only take place after the affected families have been
     briefed on it.
     5.4.2.5. Nothing in this instruction is to be interpreted as permitting release of privileged, lim-
     ited-use safety investigation board information under any circumstances. All such information
     must be clearly distinguished from “investigation information,” which is purely factual and sub-
     jected to review and formal release approval. Unauthorized disclosures of privileged safety infor-
     mation are punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ; DoD civilian employees are subject to
     adverse personnel actions under applicable regulations; and contractors are subject to exclusion
     from future contract selection.
  5.4.3. Content and Format of Informational Updates:
     5.4.3.1. Families typically have an ongoing desire to know as much as possible about their loved
     one’s loss, and an expectation that they will be kept informed of the investigators’ progress. These
     priorities suggest the nature of investigation information most commonly sought, namely, reliable
     facts which help the survivors understand the events leading up to the mishap and the expected
     completion date of the investigation.
     5.4.3.2. There are hazards associated with providing raw information with minimal or no context
     or explanation. The most obvious of these is the temptation to “solve” the mishap on the basis of
     the facts provided, and both the persons who pass along investigation information and the families
     who receive it will be inclined to do just that. Commanders and family liaison officers must resist
     the urge to apply their experience to the information they receive, leaving the information to stand
     on its own as much as possible. Early expectations regarding the circumstances surrounding a
     mishap are often extremely difficult to overcome later, when better or more thoroughly interpreted
     data might yield very different conclusions. Before it is released, information must be reliable,
     corroborated, and as complete as necessary to avoid confusion or the possibility that someone
     could inadvertently be misled. In all cases, investigation information must be accompanied by a
     disclaimer to the effect that it is preliminary only and subject to revision pending further analysis
     or the discovery of additional evidence. The sole authoritative document with respect to the acci-
     dent investigation is, ultimately, the report the investigators produce, and that report must under no
40                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


        circumstances be put in the position of being perceived as a revision or reconsideration of previ-
        ously established “facts.”
        5.4.3.3. Similarly, it is unwise to commit to an ambitious accident investigation completion
        schedule, even when the sequence of events appears straightforward, because delays are always
        possible. For example: Witnesses may be temporarily unavailable due to mishap-related injuries.
        Physical evidence may be difficult to reach due to rough terrain, deep water, etc. Technical reports
        and analyses may be delayed due to complexity or materiel problems. However, it is precisely the
        kind of information provided in the examples above, which may be of value to families who are
        waiting for a report to help them toward closure. Delays, if legitimate and thoroughly explained,
        are both understandable and acceptable to families -- being kept in the dark, or repeatedly put off
        without explanation, is not acceptable.
        5.4.3.4. The fairest and least controversial way of passing on investigation information is to relate
        it to how and when it is established. A basic “flow plan” makes updates at once understandable
        and credible, since it keeps family members’ expectations realistic by anticipating and explaining
        challenges up front. For example: Initially: explain what factual information is being collected
        and where it is coming from. If specialized analysis will be required (e.g., readout of recording
        devices), state whether the devices have been located, where they will be analyzed, and a conser-
        vative projection of turnaround time. Later: explain how the sequence of events leading up to the
        mishap is being reconstructed (flight plans, weather briefing logs, air traffic control radar and tran-
        scripts of radio and cockpit voice recordings, etc.). Mention any data that has yet to be assembled
        to this end. Give a status report on any specialized analyses being conducted by Air Force person-
        nel away from the main investigation site; aim to have a preliminary portrayal of the aircraft’s
        route of flight available. Finally, when investigations are near the end of their field phase, assem-
        ble information regarding components which have been sent out for technical analysis; stress that
        such analysis is frequently used simply to rule out failures or malfunctions which cannot be
        readily determined through field examination.
        5.4.3.5. Many families will be focused on funeral arrangements and other personal business dur-
        ing the first week to ten days after a mishap. So, information of this type may be held until they
        are ready to receive it and then provided all at once as a “preliminary briefing.” Commanders and
        FLOs who elect to follow this course of action shall not draw any conclusions from this informa-
        tion, nor may they encourage or participate in speculation as to its significance.
        5.4.3.6. All factual, non-privileged summaries of releasable investigation information are pre-
        pared by MAJCOM POC based on investigation progress reports and factual data submitted for
        “early release” approval by AIB Presidents. All must be completed in writing so they can be
        approved for release by the MAJCOM/CC; used as briefing aids by commanders and FLOs; pro-
        vided to families following each update briefing; posted on a dedicated “home page” (see para-
        graph 5.5.); and used by MAJCOM and local PAOs to prepare media updates.
     5.4.4. Key Personnel/Responsibilities:
        5.4.4.1. SIB Members:
            5.4.4.1.1. Commanders and families must recognize that the first responsibility of safety
            investigation board personnel is to the investigation they have been appointed to conduct.
            Other lives, as well as our nation’s readiness, may depend upon their work. Still, investigation
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                       41


         information normally starts with the SIB, and therefore must be developed and up-channeled
         as rapidly as conditions permit.
         5.4.4.1.2. When board resources are constrained by the circumstances under which they are
         working or the complexity of the investigation, the flow of investigation information may be
         adversely affected. Should this occur, convening MAJCOM commanders or SIB presidents
         should consider requesting additional members to support information flow as necessary. For
         shortfalls of this type during investigations of ARC mishaps, the gaining MAJCOM/CC
         should appoint such augmentees from active duty units to avoid man-day availability prob-
         lems.
         5.4.4.1.3. The following notional process and timeline should be followed to the maximum
         extent possible: The SIB President stays continuously abreast of the progress of the investiga-
         tion. He or she keeps a running record of investigative milestones (e.g., wreckage recovery
         complete, field phase of investigation complete, witness interviews complete, etc.) and chal-
         lenges (climatic or terrain conditions, etc.) and authorizes release of progress reports periodi-
         cally to the AIB President and the convening authority. The AFSC representative screens
         factual information as it is developed, identifies reliable data which meets the content criteria
         outlined above, obtains the SIB President’s permission for release of that data to the AIB Pres-
         ident, and forwards both authorized releases and approved progress reports to the AIB. In pre-
         paring synopses of factual information, the AFSC representative will make use of language
         developed for Tabs A through S to the maximum extent possible to avoid duplication of effort
         or subsequent conflicts between preliminary and final information provided to the families.
     5.4.4.2. AIB President and Legal Advisor (as appropriate). The AIB President merges SIB
     progress reports with approved factual data into a single product and transmits it to the MAJCOM/
     JA for preparation of “summaries of investigation information.” The material is also reviewed for
     necessary redactions (Privacy Act information, etc.) prior to transmission.
     5.4.4.3. MAJCOM Point of Contact. The MAJCOM POC provides each update to the following
     persons only: The convening authority (MAJCOM/CC); the MAJCOM Director of Public Affairs,
     who retains it under embargo until advised that all affected families have been briefed on its con-
     tents (if all affected families cannot be reached within 24 hours after an update becomes available,
     MAJCOM/CCs may authorize its public release after that time); the mishap wing commander or
     equivalent (who provides it to either the decedent’s unit commander or the designated family liai-
     son officer at his/her option); the Director of Services (AF/ILV); and the MAJCOM/JA. This pro-
     cess is critical in the event of mass aircraft fatalities. A single POC must review all incoming
     requests, task out the questions, and review all responses to insure consistency and accuracy
     rather than having a variety of offices responding differently to the same questions from different
     sources.
  5.4.5. Public Affairs Participation in Investigation Information Flow. It is critical for commanders
  and FLOs to recognize that the families of persons lost in Air Force aviation mishaps typically
  become avid consumers of all available news and information regarding their loved one’s mishap. All
  public releases of information must be tempered with this realization. The AFSAP process is
  designed to make sure all such “public” information first reaches family members through official Air
  Force channels. However, there will always be situations where the media will insist that the public’s
  “right to know” outweigh that of the survivors. Therefore, public affairs strategies and responses to
  fatal mishaps must strive to place the needs of the families first and to avoid airing unnecessary com-
42                                                             AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     ment or press conferences until family members have been properly apprised of current events. The
     following discussion acknowledges the Air Force’s obligation to keep the public informed but is tem-
     pered by concern for the information needs of families. However, in every case commanders and
     PAOs should ask themselves, “Does the family know this?” before issuing any formal statements or
     releases.
        5.4.5.1. When an aircraft or missile mishap occurs, the commander at the Air Force installation
        helps the local PAO prepare an “initial release” which contains at least the following: a general
        description of the type of mishap (crash, mid-air collision, etc.); the time and location of the event;
        the aircraft's or missile's departure point and destination (unless classified or politically sensitive);
        the number of crewmembers and passengers aboard; the type of aircraft or missile involved
        (unless classified); unclassified facts about the mission the aircraft and crew were on when the
        mishap occurred, avoiding nondescriptive phrases, such as "on a routine training flight" in favor of
        a specific description of the mission’s purpose; and the fact that a board of officers will investigate
        the accident.
        5.4.5.2. In dealing with the media after a mishap, commanders and PAOs must not speculate
        about the possible causes of the mishap, even if they seem obvious. If pressed by a reporter, they
        should explain that only the investigators are qualified to determine the causes, and that the Acci-
        dent Investigation Board’s report will provide further insight into the circumstances surrounding
        the mishap. Also, they should take the opportunity to mention that accident investigating officers
        are required by federal statute to state, if there are sufficient facts, their opinion about the cause of
        the mishap, or the significant contributing factors.
        5.4.5.3. Following any mishap, care should be taken not to jeopardize the ensuing investigations
        by making premature releases regarding witness observations or participant statements. Any such
        testimony collected under the purview of the SIB is considered privileged and will not be released.
        Sworn testimony given before the AIB that is prematurely released to the general public may dis-
        tort or render unreliable subsequent testimony, which has yet to be collected.
        5.4.5.4. Once the Accident Investigation Board’s report is complete, the convening MAJCOM’s
        Director of Public Affairs prepares a release plan. This plan will ensure that the press is reminded
        that previous releases of investigation information were preliminary in nature, and that only the
        final report should be considered authoritative. It will also explicitly require all family outbriefs
        to be complete prior to formal release of the report to the public.
     5.4.6. Legislative Liaison Participation in Investigation Information Flow. Legislative relations are
     generally the responsibility of the Director of Legislative Liaison (SAF/LL). Appropriations Commit-
     tees, Budget Committees, and the Congressional Budget Office are the responsibility of the Assistant
     Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FM), which designates
     the Office of Budget and Appropriation Liaison (SAF/FML) to meet the latter’s information require-
     ments. Three source documents establish the parameters within which these relations are conducted:
     AFPD 90-4, Relations with Congress; AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress; AFI 51-906,
     Representational and Organizational Activities of Air Force Personnel.
        5.4.6.1. SAF/LL and SAF/FML receive and forward all Congressional inquiries to the appropri-
        ate Secretariat or Air Staff agency for response, along with an action officer’s amplification on the
        nature of the inquiry as appropriate. AF/ILV will be the focal point for all congressional inquiries
        on behalf of families who have lost loved ones in Air Force aviation mishaps.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                       43


     5.4.6.2. AF/ILV will review available summaries of investigation information and will coordinate
     with the MAJCOM POC to respond to congressional inquiries, assess the quality of information
     flow, and determine if additional guidance or assistance is required.
     5.4.6.3. AF/ILV will insure that coordinated responses to all congressional inquiries are provided
     to SAF/LL by the assigned suspense date, and AF/CVA is briefed on any information flow prob-
     lems identified and/or resolved in conjunction with the inquiry.
  5.4.7. Private Attorney Involvement in Investigation Information Flow:
     5.4.7.1. The families of persons lost in Air Force aviation mishaps frequently seek legal counsel
     following their loved one’s accidental death, and have an absolute right to do so. Report any infor-
     mation regarding potential legal action to the local staff judge advocate (SJA). The SJA is
     required to immediately notify AFLSA/JACT of new or potential tort litigation against the US or
     its employees. AFLSA/JACT should notify AF/ILV, NAFs and MAJCOMs (as appropriate) con-
     cerning this communication.
     5.4.7.2. The presence of attorneys at meetings intended purely to provide information or support
     to family members can change both the relationship between information providers and the family
     and the tone of the meeting itself. If commanders or FLOs are asked if an attorney may be present
     during family meetings, they should refer that request to their servicing Staff Judge Advocate. If
     time or circumstances make such a referral impractical, such as being confronted by an attorney at
     a scheduled family meeting, commanders and FLOs should contact AFLSA/JACT, DSN
     426-9055 (commercial 703-696-9055) for guidance.
     5.4.7.3. If a family meeting must proceed with a private attorney present, but without the oppor-
     tunity to obtain Air Force legal advice, inform the family that such meetings are strictly intended
     to keep them up to date on the progress of the investigation and to ensure their support needs are
     being met. If the attorney has a list of questions for the family to ask, offer to take the questions
     back to your headquarters for the purpose of obtaining as complete an answer as possible. Do not
     attempt to answer questions which require subject matter expertise (entitlements, investigative
     conclusions, etc.).
  5.4.8. The Role of the Chain of Command in the Flow of Investigation Information. The information
  flow process prescribed by this instruction is designed to follow the chain of command to the maxi-
  mum extent possible. The objective of this sequential handling is to maintain the independence and
  integrity of the investigative process while properly equipping commanders to respond to their obliga-
  tions to family members. EXCEPTION: For ARC investigations convened by the gaining MAJ-
  COM the information flow process will be coordinated with AF/RE or NGB/CF as applicable.
  Figure 5.1. depicts the linear nature of this process.

Figure 5.1. Sequential Investigation Information Flow.




The above illustration also shows that information flow during an investigation is unidirectional, not
interactive. While the Air Force fully acknowledges the need family members have for information
regarding a loved one’s loss, it is essential not to disrupt or delay properly constituted investigations. In
other words, until the accident investigation is complete, it is not appropriate to attempt to respond to
direct inquires regarding investigative conclusions, causes, etc., because the analysis of the information
itself is not yet complete. Similarly, it is important to take care not to inadvertently mislead family mem-
bers or the public by prematurely releasing potentially inaccurate or incomplete information.
     5.4.9. Notional Investigation Information Flow for Typical Mishaps. See Figure 5.2. for a depiction
     of the notional information flow process.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        45


Figure 5.2. Notional Information Flow from Investigations to Families and Other Parties.




   5.4.10. Notional Information Flow for Mishaps of Major Public Interest. In rare cases, the convening
   authority may elect to dispatch a general officer to a mishap location to serve as Air Force spokesper-
   son regarding the investigation, resolution of claims, environmental cleanup, or other major issues
   associated with the mishap. That general officer will be designated the “MAJCOM POC” for the pur-
   poses of this instruction and will perform all duties described in paragraph 5.3.4. above. To facilitate
   effective information flow under these circumstances, the MAJCOM/PA will dispatch a PAO, either
   from the MAJCOM staff or an augmentee, to assist in preparation of summaries of investigation infor-
   mation and related press releases.
      5.4.10.1. See Figure 5.3. for a depiction of information flow when the MAJCOM POC is collo-
      cated with the AIB President.

Figure 5.3. Notional Information Flow (Collocated General Officer MAJCOM POC).




     5.4.11. Information Flow to Other Federal Agencies:
        5.4.11.1. Members of other federal agencies from all three branches of government make use of
        Air Force airlift and are thus exposed to possible loss in an Air Force mishap. In the event of such
        a loss, the leadership of the affected agency may have a need for timely investigation information
        similar to that of the family members.
        5.4.11.2. The Air Force will offer the services of a family liaison officer to the family of each
        member of another federal agency lost in an Air Force mishap. If this offer is accepted, AF/CVA
        will appoint qualified FLOs and ensure AF/ILV has provided them with all summaries of investi-
        gation information prepared by the MAJCOM POC. In addition, AF/ILV will ask the FCAT mem-
        bers to receive all summaries of investigation information for their internal use. Should the other
        agency decline the Air Force’s offer of a dedicated FLO, it is anticipated that the agency’s POC
        would assume responsibility for ensuring regular updates are provided to survivors as appropriate.
        5.4.11.3. This instruction is not to be interpreted as authority to provide investigation information
        to other federal agencies for any reason other than to ensure it reaches the survivors of their
        deceased members as rapidly as possible. The President, Vice President, and Secretary of Defense
        are entitled to receive all such information they consider necessary, but all such requirements will
        be fulfilled through Departmental channels, and not under this instruction. (For congressional
        inquiries not associated with the loss of Members of Congress or their staff, see paragraph 5.4.6.)
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          47


       5.4.11.4. See Figure 5.4. for a depiction of desired information flow between the Department of
       the Air Force and other federal agencies following the loss of members of those agencies.

Figure 5.4. Notional Information Flow to Other Federal Agencies Following the Loss of Their Per-
sonnel in an Air Force Mishap.




5.5. Survivor Assistance on the Internet. The information-sharing capabilities of the Internet make it
an ideal means of providing useful assistance to families. AF/ILV is responsible for the Survivor Assis-
tance Website to provide assistance to families. This site may also be utilized to post accident reports that
have been previously released to family members and the media. Such action will preclude duplicating
paper copies of reports that are already in the public domain.

5.6. Toll Free Number. AF/ILV will staff and operate a toll free number for information for families and
friends. If needed, additional toll free numbers will be obtained and activated. SAF/PAZ and local PA
offices will publicize the toll free number. AF/ILV will telephone primary family members of individuals
who survive an aviation mishap.

5.7. Post-Mortem Examination (Autopsy) Results and Death Certificates:
   5.7.1. Post-mortem examination results represent a particularly sensitive type of information to
   which next-of-kin are legally entitled, but other “family” members may not be. Autopsy reports are
48                                                           AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     public records in some states, but are protected as a matter of personal privacy in others. Local coro-
     ners sometimes exercise rights of their specific jurisdictions to require autopsies to be accomplished
     in their own facilities, or by their own staffs. In other cases, military Medical Treatment Facility or
     Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) personnel may conduct the autopsy, creating records
     which may or may not be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act, depending on the
     facts of the case and the privacy considerations of the surviving family members.
     5.7.2. Autopsy reports are never included in accident investigation board reports.

 BENEFITS AND SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS OF ACTIVE DUTY, AIR FORCE RESERVE,
                   AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS

6.1. Casualty Assistance. The Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR) possesses comprehensive
information regarding post-death benefits which needs to be conveyed to NOK and other family members
as quickly and efficiently as possible. During the family briefings the CAR addresses:

       6.1.1.4. Dependent Travel and Shipment of Household Goods: Arrangements for dependents’
       moving expenses, including shipment of household goods and one privately owned vehicle.
       (These entitlements are governed by the Joint Federal Travel Regulation, Volume I, the Joint
       Travel Regulation, Volume II, and AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement; arrangements for these ser-
       vices must not be made without first consulting the Traffic Management Officer)
       6.1.1.5. Reissuance of the Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card (ID Card): ID
       cards issued while the sponsor was alive are not valid; the holder must apply for a new card that
       shows he or she is a dependent of a deceased service member.
       6.1.1.6. Medical Benefits: Eligibility and availability.
       6.1.1.7. Commissary and Base Exchange (BX): Eligibility and availability.

       period of 180 days; if dependents are not occupying government housing, they may receive a
       Basic Allowance for Quarters and a Variable Housing Allowance, or an overseas housing allow-
       ance for 90 days after the member's death.
       6.1.1.11. Financial Assistance: The Air Force Aid Society may offer temporary financial assis-
       tance to a dependent faced with a financial emergency based on immediate needs.
50                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     6.1.2. Social Security Benefits:
        6.1.2.1. Monthly Payment: The Social Security Administration makes monthly payments to some
        qualified persons based on their age and relationship with the decedent. (e.g. a spouse who was
        living with the member at the time of death; or if no surviving spouse, it pays the lump sum to the
        eldest child eligible for monthly Social Security benefits during the month that the member died.)
     6.1.3. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits:
        6.1.3.1. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC): the VA pays DIC to certain relatives of
        service members whom the VA determines died from service-related injury or illness; the VA does
        not pay DIC if it determines that the member's own misconduct contributed to the death.
        6.1.3.2. Education Benefits: Dependents Educational Assistance provides educational opportuni-
        ties for certain relatives of a service member who dies from service-connected injury or illness; in
        addition to the Dependents Educational Assistance program, various programs are available to
        help dependent children reach their education goals.
        6.1.3.3. VA Home Loan: an unremarried spouse of a service member who died from ser-
        vice-related injury or illness may be eligible for a government-insured home loan.
        6.1.3.4. Non-service-connected Death Pension: A monthly payment which applies to eligible
        widows or widowers and qualifying children of wartime or Vietnam-era service members who
        died from causes not related to military service.
        6.1.3.5. Headstone or Grave Marker: the US government provides headstones or grave markers
        for the grave sites of those interred in national cemeteries; these are also made available for veter-
        ans buried in private cemeteries, but the family must pay the cost of placing the marker in a private
        cemetery.
        6.1.3.6. Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI): Based on the member’s election of cover-
        age, the Office of Servicemen's Group Life Insurance processes and pays claims under the juris-
        diction of the VA.
        6.1.3.7. Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) and Montgomery GI Bill Refunds: if
        the service member contributed to either of these programs, the designated SGLI beneficiary may
        receive any unused contributions.
     6.1.4. Miscellaneous Benefits:
        6.1.4.1. Commercial Life Insurance: survivors will be advised to contact their CAR or insurance
        company for settlement guidance.
        6.1.4.2. Credit Unions, Banks, and Charge Accounts: survivors will be advised to contact all
        financial institutions concerning transfer of accounts to the survivor's name, and also to ask about
        any insurance associated with the accounts.
        6.1.4.3. Air Force Village Foundation: widows and widowers of active duty Air Force officers
        and their minor dependent children may live at the Village for one year immediately after an active
        duty member's death; the widow or widower must be age 62 or over to become a permanent resi-
        dent.
        6.1.4.4. Air Force Enlisted Men's Widows and Dependents Home Foundation: widowed spouses
        over age 55 of Air Force enlisted members are eligible for residency.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        51


     6.1.4.5. Civil Service Job Preference: a widow or widower may be eligible to receive a ten point
     veterans service preference for Federal service employment if the deceased member served in
     wartime or in a peacetime campaign or expedition for which the member received a campaign
     badge or service medal.
     6.1.4.6. State Benefits: many states have laws that provide certain rights, benefits, and privileges
     to the spouse and children of deceased service members, including bonuses, educational assis-
     tance, employment preference, and tax exemptions.
     6.1.4.7. Income Tax Benefits: some death benefits may be taxable, and some death-related
     expenses are deductible.
     6.1.4.8. Victim Witness Assistance Program (VWAP): Should the investigation become a crimi-
     nal one or if the accident is suspected to be an act of terrorism, coordinate with the local Air Force
     Victim Witness Assistance Liaison to arrange victim witness assistance services. The VWAP liai-
     son will be assigned to the base legal office. If it were unclear which installation should act as the
     liaison, contact the Air Force Victim Witness Assistance Coordinator at AFLSA/JAJM to deter-
     mine which base legal office would be the most appropriate office to act as the VWAP liaison. All
     victims should be treated in accordance with the guidelines outlined in AFI 51-201, chapter 7.
  6.1.5. Educational Assistance:
     6.1.5.1. Scholarship Information: many states, universities, and other groups sponsor scholarship
     programs for the children of deceased service members (particularly those with wartime service).
     6.1.5.2. The Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) Guaranteed Student and Parent Loan Programs: the
     AFAS offers educational loan programs to Air Force personnel and their children, spouses, and
     widows or widowers to help them finance post-secondary education.
  6.1.6. Death Certificates. The Air Force Casualty Assistance Division, located at Headquarters Air
  Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC), Randolph AFB TX 78148, publishes DD Form 1300, Report of
  Casualty, which in effect, is an Air Force death certificate. The DD Form 1300 used in lieu of certified
  copies of the civilian death certificate under some circumstances when proof of death is required for
  submissions of claims, etc. DD Form 1300 may not be an adequate substitute in all circumstances.
  See paragraph 5.6. in connection with local jurisdiction and issuing death certificates. Copies of the
  DD Form 1300 will be provided to appropriate family members without cost. (The cost of certified
  copies of civilian death certificates is a personal expense not payable by the Air Force.)
  6.1.7. Air Reserve Component Entitlements. Some programs unique to the Air Force Reserve, such
  as the Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan, may be available to survivors of Reservists. Some
  entitlements described above also vary between active duty and Air Reserve Component members.
  The Air Reserve Personnel Center’s Entitlements/Casualty Branch, DSN 926-6576, can help answer
  specific questions regarding these differences.
     6.1.7.1. (Added-ANG) By definition, this includes Air National Guard members. Entitlements
     vary by member’s duty status at time of death. Some states have specific entitlements available to
     guardsman assigned in their state. Casualty Entitlement questions should be referred to the CAR
     in the victims servicing MPF.
  6.1.8. Summary. See AFI 36-3002, Attachment 21 for more detailed information on all of these enti-
  tlements. Bear in mind that the specialized expertise of the CAR is irreplaceable in discussing these
52                                                           AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     matters with the families, and every effort should be made to put the CAR in direct contact with any
     eligible individual who has specific questions.

6.2. Critical Incident Stress Team. The CIST process is generally described in Chapter 2 and is
explained in the context of initial casualty notification in Chapter 4. Critical Incident Stress Manage-
ment (CISM) services are specialized benefits, which should be drawn upon as early as possible following
a traumatic event to facilitate understanding of and provide guidance through the grieving process. Sud-
den loss can have profound medical and psychological effects, which can be mitigated with timely and
caring support. The CIST skill set includes: recognition of physical and mental conditions requiring
monitoring and/or referral; techniques for confronting and addressing loss; tailored intervention proce-
dures for children, the elderly, and persons of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds; and strategies for
dealing with the special stresses created by losses suffered while at overseas assignments, or within small,
tight-knit communities. Commanders and family liaison officers should seek CIST counsel when
attempting to determine a family’s readiness to receive and act on information (see Chapter 5). They
should also obtain CIST expertise in addressing their own personal response to the mishap, as well as the
need for outreach to the base or surrounding community.

6.3. Mortuary Affairs. The Air Force Mortuary Affairs program is administered through the base Ser-
vices (SV) function, the MAJCOM/SVs, and the Air Staff (AF/ILV). Subject matter expertise resides at
the Air Force Services Agency (HQ AFSVA/SVOM) in San Antonio TX. The following is a brief synop-
sis of a complex and sensitive subject; commanders and FLOs are strongly advised to seek expert assis-
tance when specifically questioned on any issues regarding entitlements or eligibility. In all such cases,
base mortuary affairs officers, followed by MAJCOM/SV personnel, must be consulted first; if the matter
cannot be resolved satisfactorily at either of those levels, commanders may contact HQ AFSVA/SVOM at
DSN 487-5806 or (800) 531-5803 for guidance, but only after all other opportunities for resolution have
been exhausted.
     6.3.1. Source Documents and General Information:
        6.3.1.1. AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program: this is the overarching guidance for all mortuary
        affairs-related activities, including the “Current Death Program” (preparation and transportation
        of remains), the “Personal Property Program” (managed through the summary court process under
        AFI 34-244, Disposition of Personal Property), and the “Installation Honor Guard Program”
        (which ensures military honors are as widely available, as possible to respond to funeral and
        memorial requests IAW AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program).
        6.3.1.2. AFPAM 34-261, Mortuary Services Benefits For Members Who Die While On Active
        Duty: this is an extremely useful pre-need publication which should be reviewed by all FLOs prior
        to first contact with family members of a deceased active duty member. It is addressed to members
        rather than family members, and thus should be used as reference material rather than as a docu-
        ment to be provided to the family.
        6.3.1.3. AFPAM 34-260, Mortuary Services Benefits for Retired Air Force Members: the retirees’
        equivalent to AFPAM 34-261. (See paragraphs 1.4. and 7.5. for conditions under which retirees
        may be served by the AFSAP process.)
     6.3.2. The Identification Process. Per AFMAN 34-243, Mortuary Affairs Program Procedures, the
     Air Force must segregate and individually identify remains of deceased personnel whenever possible.
     A scientific identification is performed by an Armed Forces Medical Examiner (AFME) on an indi-
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        53


  vidual or group of individuals when any condition exists which leaves the remains severely damaged
  and unrecognizable (non-viewable).
     6.3.2.1. The mortuary affairs officer responsible for search and recovery of remains is also
     responsible for ensuring the examining official processes remains for individual identification.
     Commanders or their representatives are strongly discouraged from communicating identification
     information to the next of kin before a medical and mortuary expert identification has been estab-
     lished. Identification by friends or co-workers does not constitute official, positive identification.
     NOTE: Premature family notifications before confirmation that individuals are actually on the
     aircraft may result in undue emotional trauma.
     6.3.2.2. The official who identifies the remains for identification officially designates them as
     individually identified when it is concluded, beyond a doubt, that their identification findings
     (made through review of available physical and documentary evidence and examination of per-
     sonal effects) are in favorable agreement with an individual by name.
     6.3.2.3. An Armed Forces Medical Examiner is responsible for establishing identification of
     remains under Air Force control. No remains are officially designated as unidentified or unknown
     unless and until an Air Force identification specialist makes a complete review of the case.
     6.3.2.4. The family has the right to engage, at their expense, a private, professional forensic spe-
     cialist to examine the remains following positive individual identifications established by the
     AFME and the Air Force for remains of Air Force personnel (active duty, family members, civil-
     ian employees and their family members, and certain other eligible persons). If the family wishes
     to exercise this right, they should advise Mortuary Affairs personnel, either directly or through the
     family liaison officer.
  6.3.3. Mortuary Briefings. The base mortuary affairs officer typically presents these briefings to fam-
  ily members. They typically include, but are not limited to, the following matters: 1) Transportation
  of remains from place of death to place of interment. 2) Primary (funeral) and secondary (interment)
  expense items. 3) Next-of-kin travel entitlements (which may be facilitated by FLOs, but must
  always be coordinated with servicing Traffic Management Officer and Mortuary Affairs Officer). 4)
  Escorts (see AFPAM 34-259, Escorting Deceased Air Force Military Personnel). 5) Military funeral
  honors (the Air Force provides full military honors, including an Air Force chaplain and, if eligible, a
  “flyover” as described in AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial Events; commanders should
  bear in mind that, even if approved, on the day of the funeral a flyover may be limited by inclement
  weather or availability of aircraft). 6) Government headstone or memorial markers. 7) Interment in
  a Government (National) Cemetery (see AFMAN 34-243 for national cemetery location, interment,
  and eligibility information). 8) Personal Property and Effects (the Summary Court process (See para-
  graph 6.4. below). A separate briefing should be conducted for each NOK family to ensure that the
  concerns or questions of each family are addressed.
  6.3.4. Release of Bodies. When an Air Force member dies outside the limits of an Air Force installa-
  tion, his or her body cannot be recovered or transferred from the place of death to some other location
  by Air Force personnel without the express permission of local civil authorities. However, the Air
  Force will take all necessary steps to secure such permission as quickly as practical.
  6.3.5. (Added-ANG) The Base Mortuary Affairs Officer / Services Commander is responsible for
  ensuring personal property and effects located on the ANG installation for any Traditional ANG
  member or Technician (AGR) (who dies while not in an active duty status) are collected, safeguarded,
54                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     inventoried, and stored. The Base Mortuary Affairs Officer also identifies the authorized recipient for
     the deceased member’s property and effects.

6.4. Summary Court Process. The Summary Court process, executed by the designated SCO, can
accomplish the following tasks: Getting property disposition instructions from the NOK or designated
individual; inventorying, packing, shipping, and storing personal property as specified; turning in military
identification (ID) and other military documents and equipment; disposing of mail, personal papers,
funds, and negotiable instruments; locating and redirecting property in transit or in nontemporary storage;
disposing of property without a designated recipient. For detailed information see AFI 34-244, Disposi-
tion of Personal Property. Commanders should make every effort to return non-government property and
personal effects not required for investigative purposes to the decedent’s family as quickly as possible,
based on the next-of-kin’s formally expressed desires. (Written expression of NOK wishes may be passed
through either the mortuary affairs officer or the SCO.)
     6.4.1. (Added-ANG) For Traditional ANG members and Technicians (AGR), a SCO is not assigned.
     For guidance see paragraph 6.3.5. (Added) and AFI 34-244, Disposition of Personal Property and
     Effects, paragraph 1.2.5..

6.5. Memorials and Memorial Services:
     6.5.1. Wing/installation commanders may set aside real property on their installation for construction
     of a suitable memorial to multiple victims of a single major mishap, or for a tribute to the memory of
     multiple base personnel who have died in the line of duty. Individuals may be memorialized through
     renaming of a street or structure, with landscaping projects such as a memorial grove of trees, by add-
     ing them to an existing memorial, or by other means prescribed in AFI 36-3108, Memorialization Pro-
     gram and Ceremonies. Should special circumstances surround an individual death, such that it
     warrants special recognition, consult AF/ILV for policy guidance.
     6.5.2. Appropriated funds are not available to construct memorials. However, this in no way pre-
     cludes private organizations from establishing a fund in a local financial institution, which may
     receive donations or the proceeds of fundraising events for construction purposes. Donations or pro-
     posals for memorial construction projects should be processed in accordance with AFI 51-601, Gifts
     to the Department of the Air Force.
     6.5.3. Permanent memorials represent the Air Force’s connection with its heritage and legacy. Even
     in cases where base realignment and closing action has resulted in the loss of facilities, the Air Force
     has established procedures for ensuring that relocatable or transferable memorials can be moved.
     However, such memorials can be of equal or even greater importance to family members who may
     remain in the area of the closed facility, and their desires must be accommodated to the maximum
     extent possible.
     6.5.4. Commanders of the home installation of those who have been lost may conduct a local memo-
     rial service in their honor for the benefit of base personnel. Such services are typically arranged
     through the base chaplain and are conducted in the base chapel or other appropriate locations. How-
     ever, when remains are not recovered, commanders have no defined responsibilities for funeral ser-
     vices or family-requested memorial services. Such observances are arranged by and for the affected
     families. The mortuary affairs officer of the base responsible for military honors (see AFI 34-243)
     will provide requested honors support. Chaplain support may also be provided by the installation pro-
     viding military honors at the request of the families. The base mortuary affairs officer handling the
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                           55


   mortuary case assists families with travel arrangements to and from the location of the memorial ser-
   vice and applies for reimbursement of authorized expenses as required.
   6.5.5. The remains of persons lost in Air Force aviation mishaps or to other causes of death which
   occur outside the United States may be returned to the United States by way of the Air Force Mortuary
   at Dover AFB. “Arrival ceremonies” at the aerial port of entry are not normally conducted. However,
   remains are received with honor, dignity, and respect.

6.6. Legal Assistance:
   6.6.1. AFI 51-504, Legal Assistance, Notary, and Preventive Law Programs, governs base-level legal
   assistance activities. These efforts are characterized as “mission-related” (those which ensure that the
   legal difficulties of military members do not adversely affect command effectiveness or readiness)
   and “non-mission-related” (wherein certain categories of beneficiaries are provided support as
   resources permit). Military legal assistance attorneys shall provide advice and services to eligible
   family members in accordance with AFI 51-504.
   6.6.2. When in the interests of the command, SJAs may authorize non-mission related legal assis-
   tance to someone who is not an eligible beneficiary in accordance with AFI 51-504. In the case of
   next-of-kin and family members of service members who have died or been rendered incapacitated as
   a result of an Air Force mishap, the SJA should carefully weigh the interests of the command with the
   benefits of providing service.
   6.6.3. Legal assistance is the one type of support that must be obtained by the family personally.
   FLOs may not act on their behalf. Guidance to USAF Judge Advocate General (JAG) personnel and
   civilian Air Force attorneys is explicit on this point: “Do not enter into an attorney-client relationship
   on legal issues or concerns raised on behalf of another person, even if the other person is eligible for
   legal assistance.”

6.7. Family Liaison. A family liaison officer will be made available to any family or next-of-kin to pro-
vide timely, accurate information regarding the loss of a loved one. Secondarily, family liaison officers
will facilitate the delivery of all services to which the persons they are supporting are entitled. (See para-
graph 2.2. for a discussion of the FLO’s duties.)

6.8. Information and Referral for Mental Health Assistance:
   6.8.1. Persons who undergo the unexpected loss of a loved one, whether a spouse, a parent, a child, or
   a sibling, may are expected to grieve. Feelings of sadness and associated symptoms such as insom-
   nia, poor appetite, and weight loss are common reactions. The duration and expression of “normal”
   bereavement varies among different cultural groups. However, the shock and stress created by such
   an event can sometimes result in dangerous or unhealthy states of mind, ranging from depression to
   suicidal or homicidal tendencies.
   6.8.2. The Air Force’s first opportunity to identify and help mitigate the possibility for such responses
   comes during initial notification, followed closely by the first visit of the Critical Incident Stress Team
   (See paragraph 2.9.). Early intervention and counseling can often forestall major downstream prob-
   lems by helping the bereaved express their feelings, or at least approach them in a structured, con-
   structive manner.

     6.8.3. Involved persons who observe any of the following behaviors should encourage those persons
     displaying them to seek mental health care when appropriate (Air Force members may be referred to
     mental health professionals IAW AFI 44-109, Mental Health and Military Law):
        6.8.3.1. Indicators that a family member is experiencing symptoms which are not characteristics
        of a “normal” grief reaction: Guilt about things other than actions taken or not taken by the survi-
        vor at the time of the death; thoughts of death (such as survivor feeling that he or she would be bet-
        ter off dead or should have died with the deceased person); morbid preoccupation with
        worthlessness; visible generalized slowing of movements and speech; prolonged and marked
        impairment in daily functioning; hallucinatory experiences other than thinking that he or she hears
        the voice of, or transiently sees the image of, the deceased person; prolonged, intense sadness with
        symptoms of insomnia, loss of appetite, weight loss, which last longer than two months.
        6.8.3.2. Indicators that the individual may be suicidal: actual threats of suicide, preoccupation
        with death or suicide; prolonged lack of interest in activities; social isolation; feelings of hopeless-
        ness and helplessness; preparations for one's own death (e.g., giving away possessions, saying
        good-byes to loved ones); unusual purchases (e.g., guns, ropes, etc.); significant changes in
        behavior (e.g., decline in work performance, aggressive /violent behavior).

                                                Chapter 7

                 BENEFITS AND SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS OF CIVILIANS

7.1. General. This chapter is designed to help commanders ensure the prompt delivery of appropriate
assistance to civilians. Three distinct types of civilians are typically at risk of loss in the course of Air
Force flight operations: 1) Federal employees, to include, non-appropriated fund employees; 2) military
retirees and 3) Non-federal personnel (private citizens).
   7.1.1. Because each category may include people entitled to different benefits programs or possessing
   different standing to make claims or take other legal action against the government, each situation
   requires careful judgment in the delivery of appropriate post-mishap/death information and support to
   survivors. However, in all cases, the families of civilians have an absolute right to the same level of
   information flow and one-on-one family assistance as is accorded survivors of military members.

7.2. Air Force Civilian Employees:
   7.2.1. Commanders should refer to AFI 36-809, Survivor Assistance, for detailed information regard-
   ing Air Force civilian employee deaths in Air Force aviation mishaps. This instruction prescribes
   many of the same kinds of services and support for the families of deceased civilian Air Force
   employees as are made available to the families of military decedents. The civilian Survivor Assis-
   tance Program’s goal is essentially the same as that of its military counterpart: to reduce the trauma
   on the deceased’s next-of-kin. Each person handling the personal affairs of a deceased civilian
   employee must act with compassion and on a confidential basis.
   7.2.2. Supervisors of civilian employees are responsible for many of the activities assigned to sum-
   mary court officers for military decedents, including: Completion of appropriate personnel actions;
   closeout of time and attendance records for pay purposes; securing the employee's personal property
   for prompt inventory and shipment to the authorized recipient as directed in AFI 34-244, Disposition
   of Personal Property; arranging for turn-in of government property charged to the employee.
   7.2.3. In addition, some civilian-specific tasks are conducted by supervisors following the death of a
   civilian employee, including preparation of compensation forms as directed in AFI 36-811, Injury
   Compensation, or AFI 34-308, Service Workers Compensation Program, as appropriate, if a
   work-related injury or illness caused the employee's death; notification of an official of any union or
   employee group that the employee belonged to, so it may provide any insurance or other benefit due
   to survivors.
   7.2.4. Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF), Human Resources Offices (HRO), and the Air Force Person-
   nel Center’s Directorate of Civilian Personnel Operations (HQ AFPC/DPC) also perform support and
   family assistance functions following the death of an Air Force or DoD civilian employee, including:
   Contacting the next-of-kin and offering the assistance of AFPC or the servicing CPF (or that of a more
   conveniently located Air Force CPF); mailing copies of letters and supporting information to other
   CPFs or HROs mentioned in letters of assistance, to hasten any help they are expected to provide;
   counseling the survivors about their entitlements, which may include: unpaid compensation; death
   benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System, the Federal Employees' Retirement System, the
   Nonappropriated Fund Retirement Plan, the Thrift Savings Plan, the Nonappropriated Fund 401(k)
   Plan, the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program, and the Nonappropriated Fund Group
   Life Insurance Plan; health benefits coverage; possible eligibility under the Federal Employees' Com-
58                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     pensation Act or Nonappropriated Fund Workers Compensation Program if a work-related injury or
     illness caused the death; availability of special benefits if the death occurred because of terrorist or
     military action through the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Victim
     Witness Assistance Program; and Family Support Center services.
     7.2.5. Commanders will appoint a family liaison officer (FLO) to the family of any Air Force civilian
     employee who dies in conjunction with an Air Force mishap to ensure unimpeded flow of information
     to the affected family. The assigned FLO will also work closely with the employee’s supervisor and
     AFPC or the appropriate CPF or HRO to ensure personal assistance in obtaining authorized support
     and services.
        7.2.5.1. (Added-ANG) This includes the Air National Guard and applies to all types of death cir-
        cumstances.
     7.2.6. Eligibility for transportation of survivors and remains is dependent upon the employee’s status
     and location at the time of death. When authorized, the installation mortuary affairs officer assists the
     NOK on mortuary affairs benefits.
        7.2.6.1. When an employee dies while traveling on official government business, or while perma-
        nently serving outside the 50 states and District of Columbia, the remains are prepared and trans-
        ported as provided for in AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, and the Joint Travel Regulation
        (JTR), volume 2, chapter 6, part B.
        7.2.6.2. When an employee stationed outside the CONUS dies, travel and transportation of family
        members, household goods, and personal effects are provided as specified in AFI 34-501 and the
        JTR, volume 2, chapter 6, part B.
        7.2.6.3. If a civilian employee in the U.S. is not traveling on government business at the time of
        death, preparation and transportation of remains may not be accomplished at government expense.
        Similarly, transportation of family members or shipment of their household goods and personal
        effects is not authorized for civilian personnel who are stationed in the CONUS. Contact AF/ILV
        if a SECAF waiver may be warranted.

7.3. Federal Civilian Employees. The entitlements made available to the families of Air Force civilian
employees under the Survivor Assistance Program (AFI 36-809) should be made available to other fed-
eral civilian personnel in equivalent employment status to the maximum extent possible. The parent
agency is ultimately responsible for ensuring survivor assistance. For the purposes of this instruction,
“civilian employees” are understood to be federal Civil Service appropriated fund or non-appropriated
fund employees. Congressional members and professional and committee staff members may have mark-
edly different entitlements. Commanders must consider each situation individually, with every effort
made to provide fair and equitable treatment to all involved. When in doubt, consult AF/ILV.

7.4. Private Citizens:
     7.4.1. For the purpose of this instruction, a “private citizen” is defined as anyone not employed by the
     federal government who is involved in a fatal Air Force mishap. For the purposes of this paragraph,
     foreign citizens (other than foreign military personnel) are included in this category as well.
     7.4.2. The families of persons who lose their lives in conjunction with an Air Force mishap will
     sometimes be accorded the same opportunities for family liaison officers and investigation informa-
     tion flow accorded all other categories of personnel discussed in this instruction. For example, a FLO
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          59


   would generally be utilized to assist the surviving family of a private citizen killed while flying as an
   authorized passenger aboard an Air Force aircraft for official purposes.
   7.4.3. Deceased retired military personnel are entitled to some mortuary service benefits similar to
   those of active duty personnel in recognition of their long and faithful service, within the limits of the
   law. These include: Military funeral honors (within the limits of available resources in the area of
   interment); Veterans Administration (VA) benefits (interment in a national cemetery, preparation of a
   government headstone, a “burial allowance,” and a memorial flag); space-available transportation
   from overseas to CONUS under certain criteria determined by the State Department. However, unless
   a retiree dies while an in-patient in an Armed Forces medical facility, the costs associated with trans-
   portation of remains within the CONUS are not covered. Consult AFPAM 34-260 for details on the
   benefits for which the families of retirees may be eligible; see also paragraph 1.4.5. of this instruction
   for additional information.

7.5. Commanders’ Quick Reference on Civilian Eligibility for Benefits and Services. Table 7.1.
summarizes the various benefits and services to which the various categories of civilians described in this
chapter may be entitled. It is intended as a generalized overview only. Commanders must contact the
appropriate functional expert any time specific questions need to be addressed on behalf of families seek-
ing assistance.

                                               Chapter 8

                        SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

8.1. Nonrecoverable Remains. The Air Force policy on the recovery of remains is as follows: when
efforts to recover human remains from any inaccessible location, at sea or ashore, would unreasonably
endanger the lives of those making the attempt, commanders must consider both the risks involved and
the desires of the next-of-kin before pursuing them further. The following more fully explains these basic
tenets:
   8.1.1. In cases where aircraft crash into bodies of water or in extremely remote areas, commanders
   must explain to the families of those aboard that salvage operations are sometimes dangerous and gen-
   erally warranted only when necessary to determine the cause of the mishap. There is also the possibil-
   ity that remains could be disturbed, or less than fully recovered, during attempts to retrieve them. AFI
   34-243 acknowledges these possibilities, directing Mortuary Affairs personnel to: delay requesting
   disposition instructions prior to termination of aircraft salvage operations without the approval of Air
   Force Mortuary Affairs; continue search and recovery operations for remains only until the salvage
   for aircraft parts is completed; and be prepared to resume search and recovery activities in the event
   additional remains are discovered after the aircraft salvage operation is terminated.
   8.1.2. It is extremely important for the entire chain of command to be as forthcoming as possible
   regarding the purpose of salvage operations, as well as the feasibility and desirability of remains
   recovery in conjunction with such operations. For crashes in remote areas, photographs of the overall
   location and maps of the region frequently illustrate the problem in a way verbal explanations cannot.
   However, since such depictions may be the only way families might ever see the actual place where
   their loved one died, commanders and FLOs are advised to bear in mind the emotional impact such
   briefing aids might have when considering their use.
   8.1.3. Since a failure to recover remains precludes a funeral service and subsequent interment, the Air
   Force will assist the family in arranging a memorial service with Air Force participation. The memo-
   rial service may be conducted at a place selected by the family to include a place of worship, a funeral
   home, a cemetery (national or private) or a combination thereof. Round trip travel will be provided at
   Air Force expense to attend the memorial service arranged by the family. Travel is authorized for the
   surviving spouse and children, or if no spouse, the decedent’s parents. Consult the base mortuary
   affairs officer for further details; refer questions regarding special circumstances to the Air Force
   Mortuary Affairs Office if timely assistance cannot be obtained through base or MAJCOM/SV chan-
   nels.

8.2. Disappearance of an Aircraft:
   8.2.1. AFI 13-202, Overdue Aircraft, prescribes operational procedures to be observed following the
   disappearance or failure to arrive of an aircraft. All information regarding the progress of an ongoing
   search must be conveyed to families in a timely manner by the commander(s) who have suffered the
   loss, supported by updates from the commander responsible for the search.
   8.2.2. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, provides for safety investigations to commence
   once the aircraft has been missing for 10 days. If the search is suspended prior to the 10-day point, the
   safety investigation begins once the search is suspended. AIB Presidents travel to the point of origin
62                                                             AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     of the flight, home station of the aircraft, or other location as appropriate to begin the information flow
     process explained in Chapter 5 at the same time that the SIB assembles.
     8.2.3. Public affairs guidelines associated with identifying missing persons following an aircraft loss
     are more flexible than described in Chapter 4 of this instruction. While the fact an aircraft is missing
     needs to be promptly reported, the names of those aboard are not reported until the next-of-kin are
     notified. Thus, when an Air Force aircraft, including a contract or charter flight, is officially declared
     missing or crashes in a remote area, the PA office at the departure base will only release the names of
     passengers and crew to news media, after the next-of-kin are notified.
     8.2.4. Commanders typically have three options to explore in the wake of a missing aircraft with
     respect to the status of the persons aboard: 1) Declare both members and civilians “missing” if the
     conditions under which their aircraft is missing are such that it would be premature to presume the
     occupants have died; 2) Declare them “Deceased” if death is the only reasonable conclusion; or 3)
     Report military personnel in “Duty Status -- Whereabouts Unknown” (DUSTWUN) if there is insuf-
     ficient evidence to make a definite determination of death. (This status applies to military personnel
     only.) If a member’s true status is not established within 10 days, commanders are to contact the
     Casualty Services Branch at the number in paragraph 2.7. to obtain further guidance. AFI 36-3002
     paragraphs 2.7. though 2.12 further define these distinctions. However, the degree of latitude
     accorded commanders is sufficient in such cases to allow them to make reasonable assignments of sta-
     tus, which also gives due consideration to the needs of families. In some cases, the circumstances sur-
     rounding the disappearance of an aircraft, once investigated for a relatively brief period, make it much
     easier to officially declare its crew “deceased.” Doing so in the face of compelling evidence of catas-
     trophe allows all support structures and benefits to immediately come to the aid of the families,
     whereas unjustified indecisiveness or reluctance to “give up hope” can impede delivery of some
     needed services (death gratuity, etc.) and make it harder for the family to accept and deal with their
     loss.
NOTE: If a loss is due to hostile action, or under circumstances initially thought to be accidental but sub-
sequently determined to be due to hostile action, contact the Casualty Services Branch for guidance.

8.3. Surviving Participants in an Air Force Mishap:
     8.3.1. In some cases, Air Force members survive mishaps, which claim the lives of others. While
     their medical needs will be cared for as a matter of course, they will have a need for factual informa-
     tion regarding the mishap similar to that of family members who have lost loved ones. It is essential
     that CISM services are offered to survivors of mishaps to help mitigate the impact of the incident.
     8.3.2. It is essential for commanders to be as forthcoming with members in this position as they are
     with the families of the decedents. Commanders must also make deliberate efforts to ensure surviving
     members are included in post-mishap memorialization activities encouraging them to grieve with
     their colleagues and remain fully engaged in the day-to-day life of their unit.
     8.3.3. Surviving participants must be treated as material witnesses to the mishap. Their testimony
     must not be tainted or compromised prior to collection. This may mean accelerating both SIB and
     AIB formal gathering of testimony from such individuals to ensure the families of their colleagues do
     not pass on information they have received under this instruction to the detriment of the investiga-
     tions.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          63


8.4. Air Force Personnel Lost in Civilian Aircraft Accidents. There are two types of civil aircraft
accidents in which Air Force personnel are typically lost: scheduled airline flights (which are the exclu-
sive domain of the National Transportation Safety Board or host nation civil aviation authority, as appro-
priate), and flights involving civilian aircraft contracted, leased, chartered, or otherwise arranged for
official transportation purposes.
   8.4.1. Investigative Responsibilities and Information Flow:
       8.4.1.1. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has primary investigative responsibil-
       ity for any civil aviation accident, including any civil accidents in which military aircraft are also
       involved; information flow from an NTSB-controlled investigation is at the discretion of the
       Investigator In Charge (IIC).
       8.4.1.2. The Air Force may also conduct its own independent investigations of any aircraft acci-
       dent where both civil and Air Force aircraft are involved; information flow from these investiga-
       tions is as described in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
   8.4.2. Air Force Participation in and Review of Civil Aircraft Accident Investigations:
       8.4.2.1. The Chief of Safety (AF/SE) will invoke “party status” on behalf of the United States Air
       Force for every NTSB investigation of a fatal accident involving a contract air carrier, a United
       Nations peacekeeping or humanitarian airlift aircraft, or a collision between civil and military air-
       craft where Air Force personnel are lost.
       8.4.2.2. Upon request of the family, AF/SE may direct a review of the investigation report of any
       civil aircraft accident in which an Air Force member has died. This may include review of the
       National Transportation Safety Board’s “public docket,” examination of physical evidence, and
       discussions with NTSB “major investigations” personnel. The assistance and support of the
       NTSB’s Director of Aviation Safety will be solicited in all such cases, but is not required to carry
       out the intent of this section.

                                                 Chapter 9

                           MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH SURVIVORS

9.1. Governing Concept. Air Force members who give their lives in the service of their country merit
our ongoing gratitude and respect. However, it is in the best interests of all parties involved -- families,
commanders, and unit personnel alike -- to make positive efforts toward closure and looking to the future.
The best gauge of how and when to scale back continuous support and regularly provided information in
favor of providing assistance and answers to specific questions on request is the nature and frequency of
the family’s contacts with their assigned FLOs and the commanders supporting them.

9.2. When to Disengage:
     9.2.1. Prior to public disclosure of the AIB Report, the family of each person who died must be
     briefed on the results of the investigation. This may be accomplished either by the AIB President or
     by designated and specifically trained “notification officers.” The latter is preferable when multiple
     families must be briefed, since the goal is simultaneous notification and explanation prior to making
     the information available to the press, Congress, or the general public. In every case, survivor out-
     briefs must explain the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident, to include the cause or the
     factors contributing to the accident. They also provide a formal degree of closure to the loss beyond
     the funerals and memorial ceremonies that precede them. Review AFI 51-503 and seek MAJCOM
     guidance regarding standards and procedures for conducting these briefings.
     9.2.2. If survivor updates are accomplished on a regular basis as prescribed in Chapter 5, survivor
     outbriefs can focus on expressing the condolences of the Department of the Air Force for the death or
     injury resulting from the crash, then move efficiently through a synopsis of the investigation results
     and answer questions of the next-of-kin or family members based upon the facts contained in the
     report. Once this obligation has been discharged, it is up to the wing/installation commander who has
     supported family liaison since the accident to render a judgment as to the future need for regular con-
     tact and a continuously identified family liaison officer.

9.3. Ongoing Support Needs. Upon official notification of a local commander’s disengagement from
support of a specific family provided for under this instruction, the Director of Services (AF/ILV)
assumes long-term responsibility for responding to future requests for information or assistance in obtain-
ing support or services. Other organizations (medical, legal, transportation, personnel, and others) may be
called on to provide assistance, counseling, and referral services by family members as necessary. Private
organizations such as those referred to in paragraph 2.12.5 may also be ideally suited to provide long-term
support to families. In any event, the Air Force will continue to be responsive to all requests made by
families that have received information and assistance under this instruction.

                                               Chapter 10

       SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE OF AIR FORCE SERVICES (AF/ILV)

10.1. Mission:
   10.1.1. Air Force Services (AF/ILV) and the Survivor Crisis Action Team (SCAT) serves as the
   Headquarters Air Force focal point for all issues related to the survivors of persons who lost their lives
   in the Air Force. It provides information and advisory assistance to commanders at all echelons
   affected by such a tragedy. It reports directly to the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff (AF/CVA).
   10.1.2. Air Force Services (AF/ILV) maintains Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 34-11, Service to
   Survivors, as well as all publications within the AFPD 34-11 series of directives. It periodically
   reviews all directives with which AFPD 34-11 directives interact and coordinates on changes to those
   directives as required.
   10.1.3. Air Force Services (AF/ILV) is the office responsible for all communications between the
   Department of the Air Force and other Federal agencies related to fatalities experienced in Air Force
   aviation mishaps except where specific functional responsibilities (e.g. claims, Legislative Liaison)
   are already in being.

10.2. Survivor Crisis Action Team (SCAT) Process. In the event of an aircraft disaster or other emer-
gency Air Force Services (AF/ILV) will activate the SCAT. The SCAT will meet as required usually
twice per day to crossflow information and work with functionals at the MAJCOM or other levels. Direct
contact between the SCAT and local base officials should be rare. Most information will be channeled
through MAJCOM functionals to the SCAT and its functionals. The SCAT’s function is to provide infor-
mation to senior leadership on on-going actions surrounding the mishap and to provide Air Staff assis-
tance to MAJCOMS or local commanders, as necessary.
   10.2.1. The SCAT membership will, at a minimum, be from the following directorates:
       10.2.1.1. AF/ILV (Chair)
       10.2.1.2. AF/ILT
       10.2.1.3. AF/DPD

        10.2.1.14. AFRC
        10.2.1.15. AF/ILEX
     10.2.2. Based on the severity of the accident the Chair will decide on the frequency of meetings and
     the membership of the SCAT. Some members may be required on a regular basis and others may only
     need to be “on-call.”
     10.2.3. AF/ILV will continue to keep the SCAT operational until the final funeral is completed.
        10.2.3.1. A “hotwash” will be conducted following each major mishap and both problem areas
        requiring corrective action as well as successes will be recorded.
        10.2.3.2. A formal record of all SCAT activities will be maintained during and following the mis-
        hap.
     10.2.4. Air Force Services will have toll free numbers that will be provided to family members and
     FLOs for questions that cannot be answered locally.
     10.2.5. Responsibilities. Each SCAT member is responsible for the following areas at minimum:
        10.2.5.1. ILV will operate the Air Force Survivor Assistance Program, activate the SCAT, main-
        tain current SCAT rosters, operate toll free telephone numbers, provide information and regular
        updates to senior leadership, staff questions and recurring requests, prepare and conduct training
        for Group and Wing Commanders at Air University and provide overall guidance and leadership
        for the family assistance program. In the event of an aircraft crash where there are survivors
        aboard the aircraft, ILV will contact the primary family members of those individuals to inform
        them that their loved one survived the accident.
        10.2.5.2. DPD will provide key liaison with Family Support Centers worldwide and with MAJ-
        COM points of contact. Additionally they will provide information on casualty notification pro-
        cedures and various personnel programs like Servicemen’s Group Life Insurance. DPD will assist
        ILV in obtaining the names and phone numbers of next of kin or primary family members of indi-
        viduals who survive a major aircraft accident so that Survivor Assistance personnel can contact
        them.
        10.2.5.3. SEI will receive and process requests for information related to safety investigation
        boards on behalf of the other SCAT members. Direct contact between SIBs and SCAT members
        other than AF/SEI is not authorized.

        will provide assistance teams to go to the accident site or home installation as necessary.
        10.2.5.8. SGX will provide assistance or information on medical issues as needed.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                         67


       10.2.5.9. XOO will coordinate the approval and scheduling of flyovers for authorized personnel
       for memorial services, funerals and air transportation for family visits to the mishap site. They
       will work closely with the Air Force Services Agency, Mortuary Affairs Branch.
       10.2.5.10. ILT will work all transportation requirements and waivers as necessary
       10.2.5.11. JAC is responsible for coordinating approval of interim releases of information from
       the AIB with HQ/AF. JAC is also responsible for all claims and litigation arising out of the mis-
       hap.
       10.2.5.12. ANG and AFRC will be available to assist and coordinate any assistance that the Air
       National Guard or Air Force Reserve unit involved in an aviation mishap may require.

10.3. Survivor Assistance Case Files. A case file includes information protected under the Privacy Act
of 1974 (see title page of this instruction for citation). AFI 37-132, Air Force Privacy Act Program, pre-
scribes specific procedures for compliance with the law.
NOTE: Some of this information may already be in the public domain through biographies, open directo-
ries, etc. Consult AF/JAG for appropriate response to requests.

10.4. Routine Case Management:
   10.4.1. Upon notification of a fatal mishap by the Air Force Operations Center or through other chan-
   nels, the Director or Services (AF/ILV) will initiate actions described in Attachment 2 (“AF/ILV Ini-
   tial Response Checklist”).
   10.4.2. In the event of an aircraft accident with a fatalities as well as survivors, ILV will contact the
   primary family members or NOK of those survivors and inform them that their loved ones have sur-
   vived the aircraft accident. The toll free number for Survivor Assistance will be publicized for friends
   and family members to call for information. DPD and the Air Force Personnel Center will provide
   names and phone numbers of NOK and primary family members. Casualties and seriously injured
   personnel notifications will be made in the standard manner.
   10.4.3. ILV, with assistance from the SCAT, will initiate and maintain contact with the designated
   MAJCOM POC and the affected wing/installation commander throughout the course of the safety and
   accident investigations, receiving summaries of investigation information, as they become available.
   The MAJCOM OPR for the AFSAP is the MAJCOM/SV.
   10.4.4. ILV, with assistance from the SCAT, will serve as points of contact for family members, the
   Air Staff, and the Secretariat for all survivor family issues elevated to Headquarters Air Force through
   MAJCOM channels or as a result of Congressional or media interest.
   10.4.5. ILV and the SCAT will serve as long-term contacts for families who elect to discontinue local
   communications with their originally assigned FLO or the mishap unit or wing/installation com-
   mander. If a case involving multiple fatalities results in only a few families requiring Headquar-
   ters-level support, principal case officers may be reassigned internally based on workload and prior
   contacts with the involved families.
   10.4.6. Decedent family case files will be retired as permanent in accordance with AFI 37-138,
   Records Disposition -- Procedures and Responsibilities, when no longer required to manage HQ
   USAF support actions on the family’s behalf. A case file will be considered inactive if no new
   requests for information or other staff actions have been received for 24 consecutive months.

10.5. Crisis Response and Augmentation. Following mishaps, which receive unusually high levels of
attention, individual mobilization augmentees may augment AF/ILV. Should a prolonged requirement for
outside assistance become necessary to satisfactorily meet the needs of supported families, AF/CVA may
levy personnel from other Air Staff organizations on a temporary detail basis.

10.6. Interaction with Other Headquarters Air Force Functions:
     10.6.1. AF/ILV with assistance from the SCAT will act as ombudsman at the Headquarters Air Force
     level for all issues associated with information flow to, and care and support of, surviving families
     (should such issues require Headquarters Air Force resolution). In conjunction with execution of this
     charter, AF/ILV may work directly with organizations for resolution of Air Force/survivor disputes on
     behalf of the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff.
     10.6.2. AF/ILV must coordinate on all responses to Congressional inquiries processed by SAF/LLI,
     LLP, LLW, LLX, and SAF/FML which provide information related to fatal Air Force aviation mis-
     haps.
     10.6.3. AF/ILV obtains SAF/PAS (security review) coordination on proposed postings to MAJ-
     COM-maintained family-oriented web pages which involve material other than summaries of investi-
     gation information and Accident Investigation Board “Summaries of Fact” and “Statements of
     Opinion” (see paragraph 5.5.).

10.7. Interaction with Other Federal or Government Agencies.
     10.7.1. AF/ILV will be the primary POC for interacting and coordinating with other agencies to assist
     families of AF persons who have been involved in AF mishaps.

Terms
Air Reserve Components (ARC)—All units, organizations, and members of the ANG and AFRC (10
U.S.C. 261) on active duty, on active duty for training, or in drill status, and ANG and AFRC technicians;
include ANG and AFRC property and equipment. Military status starts upon beginning duty for military
pay and ends when duty stops. (All references to Air Force military personnel and property also apply to
ARC military personnel and property).
Active Guard and Reserve (AGRs)—AGRs consist of members of a Reserve component on active duty
under 10 U.S.C. 12301 (reference (© 14 U.S.C. (reference (f), or full-time National Guard duty under 32
U.S.C. 502 (f) (reference (d) for a period of 180 consecutive days or more for organizing administering,
recruiting, instructing or training the Reserve components, in accordance with Subsection 101 (d) (6) of
reference (c)).
Beeline/Faded Giant—A nuclear reactor system or radiological incident as defined by the criteria in AFI
91-204, paragraph 12.1.3.7.
Collateral Damage—Damage or injury caused by a mishap other than the damage, destruction, or injury
to the mishap equipment or personnel.
Convening Authority—This is the individual who has the authority to order a mishap investigation with
a single investigator or board.
Critical Incident Stress Debriefings (CISD)—Group discussions, which are structured in phases to
address cognitive, emotional, and physical responses to a traumatizing event. The goal of a CISD is to
encourage people to understand the normal emotional and cognitive reactions to traumatic events and to
promote effective coping with their exposure to the event. (This is especially important because
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently results from not talking about, and not being able to put
into perspective, a traumatic event. Once PTSD develops, the impairment caused by the long-term
emotional response to the trauma is harder to fix. For many, debriefings help facilitate psychological
closure to the event. CISDs usually take place 1 to 10 days post crisis.
Defusings—Short, informal discussions with individuals or small groups (at least 4 persons), which are
designed to enable assessment, triaging and mitigation of acute symptoms. Defusings are conducted
fairly rapidly after the crisis (generally within 8 to 12 hours) and serve to help normalize the participants’
reaction to the experience.
Department of the Air Force (DAF) Civilian Personnel—DAF civilian personnel include: 1) Senior
Executive Service (SES), General Schedule (GS), General Manager (GM), Federal Wage System (FWS)
employees, AFRC technicians, and ANG technicians employed under 32 U.S.C. 709, unless in military
duty status. 2) Nonappropriated fund (NAF) employees who are not military personnel working part
time. 3) Youth Opportunity Program and Student Assistance Program employees. 4) Foreign-national
civilians employed by Air Force in direct or indirect hire status. Foreign-national, direct-hire employees
are the same as DAF civilian employees. Foreign-national, indirect-hire employees are the same as DAF
civilian employees only when the Air Force has supervisory or work performance control. This includes
Air Force responsibility for any compensation claims arising from employment injury.
Dependents.—Persons who are dependent on a military member or civilian employee (sponsors). A
dependent may be one or more of the following: 1) A spouse; 2) Unmarried children, stepchildren, and
adopted children under 21 years old if dependent on sponsor for over half their support (unless they turn
21 while residing with the sponsor overseas and have a return travel entitlement, or are over 21 and
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          77


mentally or physically challenged and unable to care for themselves, or are under the age 23, enrolled in
a full-time accredited institution and dependent on the sponsor for more than half of their support); 3) A
parent, stepparent, adopted parent, or person who stood in loco parentis for the sponsor for at least 5 years
when the sponsor was a minor; 4) A parent-in-law who resides with the sponsor and is entitled to
Government-funded return travel. NOTE: A stepparent-stepchild relationship terminates with the
divorce of the blood parent from the stepparent.
Disability—Disabilities resulting from mishap injuries are divided into two categories, permanent total
disability and permanent partial disability. (See definitions of these major categories for more detail).
Emergency (Mental Health Definition)—When information or circumstances indicate an individual is
a danger to self or others or government property.
Explosives Mishap—Mishaps involving explosives, explosive devices, or toxic chemical agents
functioning unintentionally or abnormally, or are accidentally damaged or destroyed in storage, handling,
transport, maintenance, manufacture, testing, or operational use.
Family—For the purposes of this instruction only, this term includes next-of-kin, siblings, parents, and
other persons related to a decedent by blood, marriage, or long-term association who warrant
consideration as a “family member.” (See paragraph 1.4. for expanded discussion.)
Family Crisis Intervention/Counseling or Psychological Support—This is designed to foster support
of families where and when needed to help mitigate symptoms. Again, this form of crisis intervention is
not the same as psychotherapy. It includes assessment and referral, if needed.
Fatal Injury—Injuries resulting in death, either in the mishap or at any later time, due to complications
arising from the mishap injuries.
Flight Mishaps—Mishaps involving Air Force aircraft when intent for flight is established and there is
reportable damage to the aircraft.
Follow-Up and Referral Services.—Designed to assess individuals and families and to help them access
higher levels of care if needed.
Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) Mishap—Mishap involving a DoD-owned or -leased motor
vehicle where the government vehicle is in an operational mode and the vehicle is damaged, or an injury
or property damage results, due to a collision or unsecured cargo.
Ground Mishaps—Mishaps not defined in any other category. These are mishaps occurring without
intent for flight (Air Force or non-Air Force aircraft), on ground or water, on or off an Air Force
installation, and involving Air Force personnel and operations, Air Force contractor operations, or Air
Force property.
Investigation Information—A blanket term referring to releasable facts and updates derived from or
related to the progress of ongoing investigations.
“Just-In-Time” Training—For the purposes of this instruction, this refers to family liaison training
provided immediately after a major mishap.
MAJCOM Commander—The term "MAJCOM commander" as used in this instruction includes field
operating agency (FOA) and direct reporting unit (DRU) commanders, system program directors (SPD)
or equivalent, Air Force Program Executive Officers (AFPEO), etc. In addition, this term includes the air
component commander of unified commands during contingency operations. It applies to the Director,
78                                                             AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


Air National Guard and the Commander, Air Force Reserve Command to the extent that they and their
staffs support information flow from investigations and the administration of entitlement processes.
Mental Disorder—A clinically significant behavior or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in
an individual and that is associated with present distress (a painful symptom) or disability (impairment in
one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain,
disability or a important loss of freedom. In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an
expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event; e.g., the death of a loved one. It must
be a considered manifestation of a behavior, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the person.
Neither deviant behavior (political, religious, sexual), nor conflicts between the member and society are
mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of dysfunction in the member, as described
above.
Military Technicians (MT)—A civilian employee of the Military Department concerned who, except as
specified below, is required as a condition of employment to maintain military membership in a Reserve
component and who is assigned to a position as a technician in the administration and training of such
Reserve component, or in the maintenance and repair of supplies or equipment issued to such Reserve
component.
Next-Of-Kin—The person most closely related to the casualty, normally the spouse of married persons or
the parents of single persons without children. (Casualty Services); the person most closely related to the
deceased individual who is entitled to direct disposition of the remains and/or disposition of personal
property (Mortuary Affairs.)
NON-DAF Civilian Personnel—State employees supporting Air National Guard operations. Persons
employed by host-nation agencies and doing work such as public works or general engineering on Air
Force installations. The employer of persons working in such capacities is the host-nation agency paying
them, supervising them, and handling employee benefits. Indirect-hire employees are not the same
persons as DAF civilian employees when a host government has supervisory control. This includes the
host government's responsibility for insurance, compensation costs, and the like.
One-On-One Crisis Intervention/Counseling or Psychological Support—This includes intervention
with individuals where and when it is needed. Crisis intervention is not the same as psychotherapy.
Rather, it is a form of “psychological first aid” designed to help mitigate symptoms and return individuals
to a state in which they can appropriately function. One-on-one crisis intervention includes assessment
and referral to more intensive mental health resources, if needed.
Party—(National Transportation Safety Board) In NTSB investigations, the term “party” is “limited to
those persons, government agencies, companies, and associations whose employees, functions, activities,
or products were involved in the accident or incident and who can provide suitable qualified technical
personnel actively to assist in the investigation.” (49 CFR 831.11)
Permanent Partial Disability—A permanent partial disability is defined as an injury or occupational
illness which, in the opinion of competent medical authority, results in permanent impairment through
loss or loss of use of any part of the body. Injury and illness costs are used solely for statistical analysis
purposes, not mishap classification, in these exceptional cases. The following injuries are not considered
permanent partial disabilities: Loss of teeth; loss of fingernails or toenails;. loss of tips of fingers or toes;
inguinal hernia, if repairable; disfigurement; sprains or strains which do not cause permanent limitation of
motion.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                       79


Permanent Total Disability—A permanent total disability is defined as, any nonfatal injury or illness,
which is totally incapacitating. For purposes of this instruction, any mishap resulting in injury severe
enough for the individual to be comatose is a permanent total disability. Competent medical authority
determines the disabled person cannot follow any gainful occupation or is medically discharged, retired,
or separated. Losing the following body parts, or the use of them, in a single mishap is a permanent total
disability: both hands, and both feet, and both eyes, and any combination of two of these body parts.
US Air Force Military Personnel—These are: Air Force personnel on active duty with the Air Force;
ANG and AFRC personnel on military duty status; Air Force Academy cadets; Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC) cadets engaged in directed training activities. Members of other US military services
serving on extended active duty with the Air Force; Foreign-national military personnel assigned to the
Air Force.
US Air Force Mishap—An unplanned event, or series of events, resulting in: Injury to Air Force military
personnel; Injury to on-duty DAF civilian personnel; Injury to non-Air Force personnel resulting from Air
Force operations; Occupational illness of Air Force military or DAF civilian personnel. The medical staff
reports occupational illnesses through its reporting system; Illness of non-Air Force personnel caused by
Air Force operations; Damage to Air Force property; Damage to non-Air Force property resulting from
Air Force operations; Degradation of nuclear or radiological safety.

   regardless of duty status at time of death or cause of death.
   A3.2.5. Consult with the installation CISM Team Chief regarding the need for CIST services.
   A3.2.6. Determine if the unit will be activating a Family Assistance Team (see Attachment 7) or if
   base-level support of such an effort will be required.
   A3.2.7. Review AFI 34-1101.

A3.3. Within 12 hours of initial casualty notification:
   A3.3.1. Ensure Critical Incident Stress Management needs have been assessed and acted upon as
   needed. Pay attention to the mental state of all family members in attendance. If you think profes-

        they have been tasked to support, and that the FLOs are keeping personal visits to an absolute min-
        imum except in the company of commanders or subject matter experts (e.g., casualty assistance
        representative, mortuary affairs officer, etc.). Determine whom besides the next-of-kin should be
        offered investigation information; establish contact with any other family members the
        next-of-kin wishes to have involved. If these additional contacts may result in the currently
        assigned FLO being overtasked, consider appointing additional FLOs. Remember: quality, per-

        A3.4.1.13. Advise AF/ILV of any potential problems, which may be developing with respect to
        either information flow or local support.

A3.5. During each in-person or telephonic contact with the family from casualty notification until
interment is complete:
     A3.5.1. Review information provided to date regarding: the mishap itself; mortuary briefing; casualty
     assistance briefing.
     A3.5.2. Inquire about the family’s well-being and any pressing needs they might be encountering.
     A3.5.3. Confirm that the designated FLO is meeting the family’s needs and expectations; correct mis-
     perceptions if there is confusion about his/her role in information flow.
     A3.5.4. Determine if there are unresolved questions or issues that can be addressed at the time of con-
     tact.
     A3.5.5. Discuss local media interest and its effect on the family as appropriate.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                      85

   A3.6.5. Affirm the Air Force’s continuing commitment to provide all possible assistance and infor-
   mation in as timely a manner as possible.

A3.7. After the investigation is complete:
   A3.7.1. Facilitate local travel and accommodations for AIB president or assigned briefing officers.
   A3.7.2. Request an advance copy of the “Summary of Facts” and “Statement of Opinion” in the AIB
   report from MAJCOM/JA to prepare for family questions. Note: Do not provide any portion of the
   advance information to families or the media. In addition, do not expect to receive a complete copy of
   the AIB report until after the families have been personally briefed on its contents.

A3.8. On the first anniversary of the mishap:
   A3.8.1. Forward a one-year anniversary condolence letter to next-of-kin/family members to reiterate
   the Air Force’s sympathies and assess whether the survivors have been receiving the assistance and
   support they need. The unit who lost the member(s) prepares this letter. The base SV, MAJCOM SV,
   and HQ USAF/ILV must be included as cc recipients. (Sample condolence letter is at Attachment
   13).

     A4.2.2. Confirm next-of-kin for each involved member from DD Form 93 in Unit Personnel Record
     Group.
     A4.2.3. Nominate suitable family liaison officers to wing/installation commander as required; ensure
     they receive just-in-time training if time permits.
     A4.2.3. (ANG) For Air National Guard units, this will be accomplished for all ANG members,
     regardless of duty status at time of death or cause of death.
     A4.2.4. Activate Family Assistance Team if previously organized; request base level support as
     needed.
     A4.2.5. If the mishap significantly degraded the unit’s operational capability, so advise the wing/
     installation commander ASAP.
     A4.2.6. Delegate further response and investigation-related activities to operations officer, deputy
     commander, or other qualified officer.
     A4.2.7. Participate in casualty notifications.
     A4.2.8. Contact the CISM Team Chief to assess need for and coordinate CIST services; arrange a
     one-on-one CISD for you.
     A4.2.9. Review AFI 34-1101.

A4.3. At the casualty notification meeting:
     A4.3.1. Ensure the following subjects are addressed as completely as possible:
     A4.3.2. The basis upon which the decision has been made to advise the family of the loss (positive
     identification, reasonable certainty, missing or overdue aircraft, etc.).
     A4.3.3. Whether positive identification has been made, or if there will be a delay before that can be
     accomplished.
     A4.3.4. How to contact you.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        87


   A4.3.5. The roles the other people present or immediately available (casualty assistance representa-
   tives and other assistance providers such as CIST members) will play in trying to help in the days
   ahead.
   A4.3.6. The role of the FLO in facilitating information flow regarding both the loss itself and avail-
   able services.
   A4.3.7. The Air Force’s willingness to make other notifications (to other family members, a close
   friend, a relative, or a clergy member) to provide immediate support and comfort to the family.
   A4.3.8. Avoid the following topics if at all possible:
       A4.3.8.1. How insurance payments and arrears of pay will be handled.
       A4.3.8.2. Mortuary affairs matters (which will be handled separately by the mortuary affairs rep-
       resentative).
       A4.3.8.3. Specific questions regarding line of duty neglect, errors of judgment, or the responsibil-
       ity of others involved in the mishap.
       A4.3.8.4. Any personal conjecture regarding the person’s loss.
       A4.3.8.5. Any other subject you are not fully qualified to address.
   A4.3.9. Explain the purpose of the FLO and that they will be assisting.
   A4.3.10. Make an initial offer of whatever unit Family Assistance Team capability might be immedi-
   ately available (child or elder care, phone-watching, etc.)

A4.4. During each contact until interment is complete:
   A4.4.1. Review information provided to date regarding the mishap itself; Mortuary briefing; Casu-
   alty assistance briefing.
   A4.4.2. Inquire into the family’s well being and any pressing needs they might be encountering; eval-
   uate the effectiveness of Family Assistance Team assistance (transportation, child/elder care, etc.)
   being rendered and the need for possible adjustments to personal support arrangements.
   A4.4.3. Confirm that the designated FLO is meeting the family’s needs and expectations; correct mis-
   perceptions if there is confusion about his/her role in information flow.
   A4.4.4. Determine if there are unresolved questions or issues that can be addressed at the time of con-
   tact.
   A4.4.5. Discuss local media interest and its effect on the family as appropriate.
   A4.4.6. Inquire into the effectiveness and helpfulness of CIST interventions; make personal observa-
   tions regarding the state of mind of various family members for discussion with wing/installation
   commander and head of medical treatment facility as necessary.
   A4.4.7. Affirm the Air Force’s intention to provide all possible assistance.

A4.5. During each contact until the mishap investigation is complete: Begin to establish a pattern of per-
sonal disengagement from routine contact once the family has begun to adopt a stable routine and appears
to be making plans for their future. Keep the FLO fully engaged through regular, predictable contact at a
88                                                         AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


frequency acceptable to the family. Ensure CIST debriefings continue to be offered as often as needed;
take advantage of periodic CIST defusings for yourself.

A4.6. On the first anniversary of the mishap:
     A4.6.1. Generate a one-year anniversary condolence letter for wing commander signature to be sent
     to next-of-kin/family members to reiterate the Air Force’s sympathies and assess whether the survi-
     vors have been receiving the assistance and support they need. The base SV, MAJCOM SV, and HQ
     USAF/ILV must be included as cc recipients.
     A4.6.1. (ANG) For Air National Guard units, this will be accomplished for all ANG members,
     regardless of duty status at time of death or cause of death.
     A4.6.2. Consider the appropriateness of a brief memorial service marking the event.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                       89

                        FAMILY LIAISON OFFICER (FLO) CHECKLIST

A5.1. Upon selection as a potential FLO: Review AFPD 34-11, AFI 34-1101, and USAF Family Assis-
tance Resource Guide. Attend initial FLO training as soon as possible. Make sure you have your own
hard copy of this instruction, and keep it with you at all times until relieved of FLO duties.

A5.2. Upon notification of a mishap requiring your service as a FLO:
   A5.2.1. Remind yourself that your role is to help facilitate communications between the family and
   subject matter experts and investigators. NOTE: Your role is not to be an expert in all of the subjects
   covered in this instruction, and it is not to decide what information the family should receive.
   A5.2.2. You have been assigned to help them get through a very difficult time in their lives, and they
   need you. If you are grieving the loss yourself, try to remain as professional as possible, but remem-
   ber that you are not required to stay stone-faced and dispassionate no matter what.
   A5.2.3. Check to see if you will be given any refresher or “just-in-time” training prior to your first
   meeting with your assigned family.
   A5.2.4. Ask the unit commander to review any personal information (to include personal data card
   information) he might have on the member who has died. NOTE: For persons other than members of
   the Total Force, ask the wing/installation commander for as much information as is available regard-
   ing the person who died, the circumstances surrounding their involvement in the mishap (authorized
   passenger, bystander, etc.), and who the family wishes to have contacted.
   A5.2.5. Remain open to the possibility that a loss initially considered accidental may subsequently be
   determined to have been due to a deliberate act (terrorism, etc.). Family liaison support will continue
   to be required, but will move into the realm of legal and law enforcement professionals. Contact your
   servicing Staff Judge Advocate for information regarding the “Victim Witness Assistance Program”
   (VWAP), and see paragraph 1.3.4. for additional details.
   A5.2.6. Determine how often you need to brief the Mortuary Affairs Officer/NCO, Group Com-
   mander, Wing Commander or other parties on the status of your dealings with the family.
   A5.2.7. Begin a log or journal recording time, place, duration, and subjects covered for each contact
   with the family.

A5.3. At the first meeting:
   A5.3.1. Ask someone to accompany you, such as your wing/installation commander or the member’s
   squadron commander. Do not go to the meeting by yourself.
   A5.3.2. If you knew the person who died, tell the family how you knew them, and how well you knew
   them.
   A5.3.3. If the emotion of the initial meeting is overwhelming, make it as brief as possible, but
   remember that you will be making regular and continuous contact with the family for at least the next
   two to three months.
90                                                             AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     A5.3.4. Explain what you will do for the family in your own words, as simply as possible. Mention
     these key points: Your goal is to be as efficient and prompt as possible in helping the family get the
     information and entitlements they need. You will try to anticipate the family’s needs as much as pos-
     sible regarding both information and direct support and services. You intend to treat the family just as
     you would want your own family treated under similar circumstances.
     A5.3.5. Mention, but do not emphasize, that your appointment as their FLO means you will be get-
     ting regular summaries of investigation information -- the status of the investigation and facts about
     the mishap as they become known -- specifically for their use, directly from your MAJCOM head-
     quarters. Promise that you will let them know as soon as the information starts reaching you.
     A5.3.6. Be alert to the possibility that other persons besides the next-of-kin may need to be offered
     investigation information; after consulting with the wing/installation commander, establish contact
     with any other family members the next-of-kin wishes to have involved. If you think you are being
     overtasked with excessive numbers of contacts, ask your wing/installation commander to appoint
     additional FLOs.
     A5.3.7. Pay attention to the needs of all family members in attendance. If you think professional
     intervention or counseling may be of help to the family, consult with a CIST member (mental health
     provider, chaplain or Family Support Center staff member).
     A5.3.8. Finally, mention that part of your job as the family’s FLO is to make sure they understand all
     of the information they’ll be receiving, as well as all of the help and support that is available to them.
     Be prepared to make calls to various Air Force offices on the family’s behalf, but you will probably
     find that all of the processes which are designed to get the family the help they need are already being
     activated, and may simply be trying to figure out how to make initial contact themselves.
     A5.3.9. NOTE: Don’t confuse requests to make “death notifications” (see Chapter 4) with requests
     to permanently engage people other than family members in the information flow process. While this
     instruction is written to authorize information flow to as extensive a “family” as possible, it does not
     allow non-family members to interpose themselves between the family that experienced the loss and
     the Air Force. If the family does not accept your help, don’t force it on them, but don’t lengthen the
     lines of communication, either -- withdraw, advise the wing/installation commander that the family is
     not accepting your assistance, and allow the chain of command to take over the responsibility for con-
     veying essential information directly. If you think your withdrawal is required, don’t hesitate to do so,
     and don’t treat it as a failure on your part.

A5.4. During each contact until interment is complete:
     A5.4.1. Make as many of your contacts as possible telephonic, not personal visits. Do not make any
     personal visits by yourself unless absolutely unavoidable; strive to always be accompanied, either by
     a subject matter expert (casualty affairs representative, mortuary affairs officer, etc.) or someone from
     your chain of command.
     A5.4.2. Stay vigilant as to the needs of the family to which you have been assigned. Your frequent
     contact with them puts you in the best position to make recommendations for further assistance for
     them.
     A5.4.3. Make a point of getting to know the various Air Force people, such the casualty assistance
     representative (CAR) and the mortuary affairs officer, who are responsible for providing information
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          91


   and services to family members. Sit in on their briefings if the family will let you -- doing so can help
   you understand any possible confusion or disagreements that might arise.
   A5.4.4. Make sure that follow-up questions asked at the family’s entitlements briefings are being
   answered in a timely manner by the appropriate subject matter experts, either directly or through you.
   Be ready to step in and do research as necessary to help close information gaps, but always make sure
   definitive answers come from the experts.
   A5.4.5. Refer family requests for autopsy reports to the commander of the nearest Air Force medical
   treatment facility for assistance as soon as possible. If you receive a request of this type, review para-
   graph 5.6.
   A5.4.6. Be on the lookout for family members who you have not had pointed out to you by the
   next-of-kin, such as parents or stepparents, who may be seeking information about the member’s loss.
   Air Force policy is that anyone with legitimate family ties to someone who has died in an Air Force
   mishap is entitled to effective information flow, just like the next-of-kin. Estranged family members
   also deserve our help and support. If you become aware of additional family members who seek our
   help and support, advise your wing/installation commander immediately.

A5.5. During each contact until the accident investigation is complete:
   A5.5.1. Keep making regular, predictable contact at a frequency acceptable to the family; look for the
   family to start relying on you less for help beyond the providing of investigation information as they
   begin to adopt a stable routine and appear to be making plans for their future.
   A5.5.2. Ensure CISM services continue to be offered as often as needed; take advantage of periodic
   CIST defusings for yourself following personal visits (or if you are being repeatedly contacted by the
   family outside the scheduled calls or visits).
   A5.5.3. Pay attention to the kinds of questions you are being asked. If you perceive that particular
   types of information are not being provided in a timely manner, consult with your wing/installation
   commander. If confronted by the media or an attorney, refer to paragraphs 4.12.6. or 5.4.7., respec-
   tively, for guidance.

A5.6. After the investigation is complete:
   A5.6.1. Once the family has received the Accident Investigation Board’s report on their loved one’s
   loss, your continuous, recurring responsibilities to them should end. The wing/installation com-
   mander should terminate your appointment as a FLO at this time. This does not mean you should
   immediately sever all ties with the family. Instead, you should advise them that you will no longer be
   making regularly scheduled contact, but that the entire chain of command will continue to provide as
   much help and information as it can for as long as the family may need. Insure that base support orga-
   nizations are apprised of any long-term needs and have been in contact with family members.
   A5.6.2. Be sure to get a final demobilization debriefing once you have discontinued scheduled con-
   tact with the family.
   A5.6.3. From this point on, report all calls from the family to your wing/installation commander
   without delay. Other information providers will take over your duties and get them the facts they need
   to move on.

A5.7. Upon completion of contact with the family (after investigation is complete and briefed or
when family disengages): Turn a copy of your log detailing contacts with the family into the base mortu-
ary affairs office.

                    THE SAFETY INVESTIGATION BOARD (SIB) PROCESS

A7.1. Purpose and Objective.
   A7.1.1. Purpose. As described in AFI 91-204, the purpose of a safety investigation is “only to find
   causes of mishaps in order to take preventive action.” This is critical to both the safety of future oper-
   ations and the preservation of readiness and mission capability. Therefore, safety investigation board
   reports are “privileged” (meaning they are exempt from disclosure outside official safety channels)
   and “limited-use” (meaning they are created solely for a specific purpose and may not be used other-
   wise).
   A7.1.2. Objective. The ultimate goal of an SIB is development of findings, causes, and recommenda-
   tions which will prevent recurrence and increase the overall safety of a given weapon system, opera-
   tion, or process. These goals require speed, subjective (as well as objective) analysis, and the freedom
   to draw inferences and conclusions on the basis of information that might not meet strict rules of evi-
   dence.

A7.2. Conduct of the Investigation:
   A7.2.1. SIB Membership. A typical safety investigation of a Class A aviation mishap includes at
   least the following key personnel, each of whom brings specific expertise to bear on the loss:
      A7.2.1.1. The SIB President (a rated full colonel or higher who has graduated from the Air Force
      Safety Center [AFSC] Board President’s Course)
      A7.2.1.2. The investigating officer (generally a fully qualified flight safety officer and graduate of
      the Air Force Safety Center’s full six-week safety investigation and management course)
      A7.2.1.3. The AFSC Representative (a full-time member of the Chief of Safety’s staff with expe-
      rience in multiple investigations)
      A7.2.1.4. The “pilot member” (usually a captain or major fully qualified in the type of aircraft
      involved in the mishap)
      A7.2.1.5. The “maintenance member” (a maintenance and logistics expert with experience in the
      servicing and support of the type of aircraft involved in the mishap)
      A7.2.1.6. The “medical member” (an Air Force flight surgeon who is an expert in human perfor-
      mance in the aviation environment)
      A7.2.1.7. A commander’s representative, if requested by the commander whose aircraft or opera-
      tor was involved in the mishap. The commander’s representative will provide information to the
      SIB regarding operational and organizational details and practices.
      A7.2.1.8. In addition, the SIB President is empowered to secure virtually any specialized exper-
      tise deemed necessary to develop useful conclusions. Military experts in virtually every engineer-
      ing and human performance specialty are regularly called upon to lend their talents to support Air
      Force investigations as technical advisors.
      A7.2.1.9. Further, while major accident investigations conducted by civil authorities literally
      could not proceed without comprehensive support from the manufacturers of the involved aircraft,
96                                                            AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


        most Air Force safety investigations place strict limitations on the amount of participation allowed
        the involved aircraft’s prime contractor. If it becomes necessary to greatly expand the scope of a
        safety investigation, the core members head up individual “teams,” just as their NTSB counter-
        parts do.

A7.3. Evidence. Vast amounts of evidence are left behind in the wake of a major mishap. It falls into
three broad categories:
     A7.3.1. Documentary evidence (the “paper trail,” including all objective recorded data): usually the
     easiest to obtain, assemble, and transmit to others; it helps investigators understand the activities of
     the crew and the performance of the aircraft as the situation began to deteriorate.
     A7.3.2. Physical evidence (wreckage, damage done to surrounding property during the crash, etc.):
     valuable but requires expert evaluation and analysis which sometimes requires assistance from the
     manufacturer of the component part.
     A7.3.3. Testimonial evidence (related by participants in and witnesses to the mishap): highly depen-
     dent upon point of view and the accuracy of the individual’s memory of the event.
     A7.3.4. Because it is easy to obtain and relatively straightforward to interpret, documentary evidence
     usually forms the basis of the first accounts made widely available about any given accident.

A7.4. Deliberations. Once the SIB members have gathered all available evidence and obtained neces-
sary technical analysis of failed components, they collectively arrive at “findings” based on their profes-
sional assessment of the information at hand. The SIB assigns “cause” to one or more of these findings;
this simply means that the chain of events, which ultimately led to the mishap, would have been broken
had the “causal” factor not been present.

A7.5. Outbriefs. The SIB’s formal report and final message report, as well as the Air Force Chief of
Safety’s Memorandum of Final Evaluation of the mishap and messages contributing to its development,
are not subject to public disclosure. This restriction includes disclosure to families due to the privileged,
limited-use nature of SIB deliberations, analysis, and confidential witness testimony. Air Force personnel
requiring first-hand knowledge of the SIB’s conclusions receive briefings tailored to their need (like
weapon system, similar mission, etc.) by local safety personnel.

                   THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD (AIB) PROCESS

A8.1. Purpose and Objective.
   A8.1.1. Purpose. As described in AFI 51-503, the purpose of an accident investigation is “to provide
   a comprehensive report of the facts and circumstances surrounding an accident, releasable to the pub-
   lic and to gather and preserve evidence for claims, litigation, disciplinary, and adverse administrative
   actions, and for all other purposes.” While accident investigation board reports have many uses (all of
   which are elaborated upon in the source document), three stand out in terms of this instruction and its
   goals:
       A8.1.1.1. AIB reports are provided and personally briefed to the next-of-kin (NOK) of crewmem-
       bers and other military and civilian personnel killed and to individuals seriously injured in the
       accident. AIB reports are released to the media and the public, either in conjunction with routine
       inquires or in response to formal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. AIB reports are
       provided to Members of Congress upon request, and are the preferred vehicle for conveying fac-
       tual information about any major Air Force mishap.
   A8.1.2. Objective. The ultimate goal of an AIB is preparation of a report that contains all relevant
   facts regarding an accident and the investigator’s professional assessment of what he or she deter-
   mines to have been the cause or causes of the losses incurred. Central to this product are the “Sum-
   mary of Facts” and “Statement of Opinion.”
       A8.1.2.1. The Summary of Facts presents a thorough discussion of the facts relevant to the acci-
       dent in a narrative style. The length of the summary varies with each accident. The summary fol-
       lows a general outline prescribed by AFI 51-503, and may be modified as required by specific
       accident circumstances.
       A8.1.2.2. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2254, the Statement of Opinion presents the AIB presi-
       dent's personal opinion regarding: The cause or causes of the accident, or if the evidence surround-
       ing the accident is not sufficient to come to an opinion as to the cause or causes of the accident,
       then provide a description of those factors, if any, that substantially contributed to or caused the
       accident.
   A8.1.3. The Statement may not be considered an admission of liability by the United States or of any
   person it names, and may not be considered as evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding arising
   from the aircraft accident. It is intended solely to provide an opinion regarding the cause or causes of
   the aircraft accident, and then only if “clear and convincing evidence” supports that opinion. Clear
   and convincing evidence enables the accident investigator to reach a conclusion without serious or
   substantial doubt.

A8.2. Conduct of the Investigation. The Accident Investigation Board begins with the releasable evi-
dence assembled by the Safety Investigation Board. Part I of the SIB report (the nonprivileged part) is
provided in its entirety to the AIB President, who incorporates it unaltered (except for legally mandated
redactions of Privacy Act or otherwise restricted information) as Tabs A through S of the AIB report. The
AIB is separate and distinct from the SIB, and has different objectives. The AIB relies upon evidence and
information collected by the SIB as a starting point only. After Part I of the SIB report is incorporated into
98                                                          AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


the AIB report, the AIB President then obtains: additional factual information which is germane to the
crew, the aircraft and weapons system, and the assigned mission; all available physical evidence; conducts
witness interviews under oath using the list of witnesses interviewed by the SIB; and performs any addi-
tional testing and analyses of the evidence, as required. All nonprivileged photographs taken by the SIB
are also provided to the AIB for review.

A8.3. Outbriefs. Prior to public disclosure of the AIB Report, NOK must be briefed on the results of the
investigation. This may be accomplished either by the AIB President or by designated and specifically
trained “notification officers.” The latter is preferable when multiple families must be briefed, since the
goal is simultaneous notification and explanation prior to making the information available to the press,
Congress, or the general public. In every case, survivor outbriefs must explain the facts and circum-
stances surrounding the accident, to include the cause or the factors contributing to the accident. They
also provide a formal degree of closure to the loss beyond the funerals and memorial ceremonies that pre-
cede them. AFLSA/JACT and MAJCOM/JA guidance set standards and procedures for conducting these
briefings. If survivor updates have been accomplished on a regular basis as prescribed above, survivor
outbriefs can focus on expressing the condolences of the Department of the Air Force for the death or
injury resulting from the crash, then move efficiently through a synopsis of the investigation results and
answer questions of the next-of-kin or family members based upon the facts contained in the report.

        COMPARISON OF SAFETY INVESTIGATION BOARD (SIB) AND ACCIDENT
                    INVESTIGATION BOARD (AIB) REPORTS

A9.1. SIB Part I (General-Use) Information. Per AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, Part
I of the SIB report is fully releasable except for those matters exempt from disclosure under a FOIA
exemption or Privacy Act considerations and may include some or all of the following information:
Weather forecast, transcripts of cockpit voice recorder contents, as well as transcripts of air-to-ground and
aircraft-to-aircraft communications, maintenance and Material Data, DoD materiel analyses from
Tear-Down Deficiency Reports (TDR), flight and personnel records, AFTO Form 781 series, military
flight plan and weight and balance form, certificate of damage, statement of damage to private property,
orders appointing the board, diagrams, photographs not staged by the Safety Investigation Board to recre-
ate any part of the mishap sequence, witness testimony not gathered under a promise of confidentiality
and contractor reports not provided under a promise of confidentiality. Any or all of the factual informa-
tion above may be provided to families as an approved “early release of information” via the process
described in Chapter 5. All of the above deemed relevant by the SIB will be included in Part I (Tabs A
through S) of the Safety Investigation Board’s report. Since Part I material is factual, it is turned over to
the AIB for use in their investigation.

A9.2. SIB Part II (Privileged) Information. All Tabs included in Part II of the SIB are exempt from
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. They include the following protected information:
Board analysis, staged photographs; board reconstruction of flight plans; recreations of routes of flight
based on other than radar data; reconstruction of impact angles; extrapolation of pilot visual fields; and
findings, causes, and recommendations developed solely to prevent future recurrence. In addition, the
following will be included as privileged information: witness statements and testimony to the safety
board; rebuttals made by individuals named in the board’s findings; contractor reports (if confidentiality
is granted); Life Science reports; and board proceedings.

A9.3. AIB Report:
   A9.3.1. Documents contained in Tabs A though S of the AIB Report are the same as Tabs A through
   S of the SIB report, except as noted in Attachment 9, paragraph A9.2.
   A9.3.2. Additional contents prescribed by AFI 51-503, Aircraft, Missile, Nuclear and Space Accident
   Investigations, include an Executive Summary, a Summary of Facts, a Statement of Opinion, and
   additional documents contained in Tab T through BB.
   A9.3.3. The AIB report does not make recommendations to prevent recurrence.
   A9.3.4. The AIB President is also responsible for briefing the surviving families on the results of the
   investigation. Only after this responsibility is satisfied will the results of the investigation be made
   public. In high interest, cases, a press conference may be held.

INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM AND PROVIDED TO NON-AIR FORCE PERSONNEL
                 TRAVELING ON AIR FORCE AIRCRAFT

A10.1. Emergency Data Card:
      A10.1.1. Complete next-of-kin information is essential for prompt notification in the wake of a fatal
      mishap. If an approved Department of Defense form is available for collection of comprehensive
      information of this type, it should be completed by all passengers flying on government aircraft or
      government contracted flights (including Category “B” and Civil Reserve Air Fleet [CRAF] missions)
      for whom the Air Force does not already possess emergency data, including all private citizens, retir-
      ees, and dependents who are not flying in a qualified crew-member capacity on any government pro-
      cured aircraft. If such a form is not available at the time of flight, passenger manifests should be made
      as complete as possible.
      A10.1.2. Active duty, Guard or Reserve personnel who fly as qualified aircrew members (or are in
      training to become aircrew members) on Air Force aircraft must not complete a separate notification
      form of any type when traveling in passenger status as described above to prevent confusion with their
      record DD Form 93. However, they must be regularly reminded to maintain an up-to-date DD Form
      93 at their local Military Personnel Flight (MPF) to ensure no delay in proper notification should the
      need arise.

A10.2. Insurance Limitations. Certain private, commercial insurance policies include coverage limita-
tions. Those limitations may include, but are not limited to, travel to hazardous work sites, participation
in military, police, or firefighting activity, or flights on board military aircraft. All persons, whether gov-
ernment employees or private citizens who may be required to fly on military aircraft should be advised
to check their personal insurance policies concerning these limitations or seek insurance coverage that
does not have the referenced limitations.

                 FORCE AVIATION MISHAPS AND OTHER INCIDENTS


7 SEPTEMBER 2001


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change directs the Air Force to provide the same level of care to the survivors of any Air Force team
member who dies, regardless of how the member dies or where assigned. This includes the appointment
of a Family Liaison Officer (FLO) and all support/assistance allowed by law. It also recommends a FLO
be offered to an active duty member in the event of the death of an immediate family member. Responsi-
bilities for wing commanders, unit commanders who experience the death of a member, MAJCOM SVs,
base mortuary affairs officers, and FLOs are clarified. One-year anniversary condolence letters for all
active duty deaths are required. These letters are generated by the losing unit, signed by the wing/installa-
tion commander, with a signed copy forwarded to the base Mortuary Affairs Office, the MAJCOM SV,
and HQ USAF/ILV. Requirement for FLOs to maintain family contact logs and provide a completed copy
to the mortuary affairs office for inclusion in the mortuary case file is added. Samples of FLO appoint-
ment orders and the one-year anniversary condolence letter are added. A star (Η) indicates revisions from
the previous edition.


OPR: AF/ILVQ (Maj Kathleen E. Weatherspoon)


1.1.1. The Air Force has numerous resources to draw upon following the death of an Air Force team mem-
ber. The Air Force team includes active duty, reserve, guard, and civilian federal employees. The Air
Force may sometimes also assist families of private citizens, e.g., private citizen killed by Air Force plane
crash or AF retiree killed while travelling Space-A or contractor killed while supporting the Air Force
mission. However, it is difficult to accurately forecast the amount of assistance required or even available,
or the duration for which it might be needed, in any future incident. While many institutions are geared
toward improving our people’s quality of life, those same institutions, along with many other pur-
pose-designed processes, may play a significant role in supporting survivors upon the death of an Air
Force team member. Regardless of the category of the deceased, the family should be rendered the maxi-
mum level of assistance permitted by law.


1.1.1.1. This AFI will concentrate on aircraft incidents due to their catastrophic impact and public interest.
However, the survivors of any Air Force member or civilian employee who dies, regardless of cause of
death or place of assignment, should be provided a FLO and the maximum level of assistance permitted
by law.
106                                                           AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


1.1.1.2 Additionally, commanders should consider appointing a FLO to assist active duty members who
experience a death in their immediate family.


1.4.1.2 For the purposes of this instruction, the next-of-kin is defined as that person whose name appears
on the DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data, in the deceased member’s Unit Personnel Record Group.
(See Attachment 11 to this instruction, as well as AFI 36-3002, Chapters 3 and 7, for an expanded discus-
sion of this form’s use and importance.) The NOK is frequently called upon to make decisions and
choices, which require comprehensive explanation and sound advice. The burden of these responsibilities,
coupled with an unexpected loss of a loved one, mandates that the NOK be the primary focus of all such
services and considerations described in this instruction.


1.4.1.3. For the purposes of this instruction, unless a specific individual previously has been identified by
the deceased to be notified in an emergency (i.e., on the DD Form 93), the next-of kin will be presumed to
be the person most closely related to the victim: the parents(s) of a single person without children, a
spouse, or child(ren) of a single parent.


2.1. The Chain of Command of the Unit Experiencing the Loss. Military operations carry with them an
inherent risk of loss. Commanders have an ongoing obligation to ensure the members under their com-
mand are aware of those risks and manage them responsibly. In turn, members owe it to their families to
keep them aware of the nature of their duties and the hazards they entail. Post-loss support of the survivors
of deceased military members is an inherent obligation of command. By extension, if persons from out-
side the unit, including civilians, suffer loss of life as a result of Air Force operations, the chain of com-
mand of the unit most closely associated with the event must ensure support and assistance are rendered
to those survivors to the maximum extent allowable by law. Wing/installation commanders attempting to
fulfill such obligations will be supported by their parent MAJCOM. Should Air Force-level assistance be
required (for logistics, funding, etc), the Office of Survivor Assistance (see paragraph 2.11.) will work
with the entire chain of command to help execute the provisions of this instruction as fully as possible.
(Support to the families of civilians is expanded upon in Chapter 7 of this instruction). Specific respon-
sibilities are as follows:


2.1.2.2.1. The MAJCOM SV will appoint a MAJCOM survivor assistance representative to administer
the survivor assistance program. Actions include, but are not limited to, promoting survivor assistance
awareness, monitoring FLO training and one-year anniversary condolence letters, and reporting to HQ
USAF/ILV as required.


2.1.3.3. Take responsibility for initiating timely and effective flow of information to the families of per-
sons involved in an AF mishap, when one of their aircraft is associated with such a loss or when an inves-
tigative report of any type is initiated due to the death.


2.1.3.6. Ensure sufficient number of FLOs are appointed and trained, considering the installation aircraft,
runway capacity, and mission requirements. It is recommended every unit provide a minimum of two
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        107


FLOs (one officer and one senior enlisted) and flying squadrons provide as many FLOs as the maximum
crew complement. For example, an installation with aircraft requiring a crew of one may not need as
many FLOs as an installation with aircraft requiring a crew of eight.


2.1.3.7. Appoint, on orders, one FLO per family. (Sample FLO order is at Attachment 12). Typically, a
FLO is appointed from the home base of the deceased. However, it is sometimes more beneficial to the
family to appoint a FLO from a base closer to that family. Coordinate this assistance, as necessary.


2.1.3.8. Forward a one-year anniversary condolence letter to next of kin and family members. The unit
who lost the member(s) prepares this letter. The base SV, MAJCOM SV, and HQ USAF/ILV must be
included as cc recipients. (Sample condolence letter is at Attachment 13).


2.1.4.3. Prepare a one-year anniversary condolence letter for wing commander signature approximately
30 days before the one-year anniversary death date of their unit member. The base SV, MAJCOM SV, and
HQ USAF/ILV must be included as cc recipients. (Sample condolence letter is at Attachment 13).


2.2.1 Are nominated to wing/installation commanders by unit commanders and provided initial training
by the Services squadron or Services division personnel in accordance with this instruction before a fatal
mishap requires their services. Family Liaison Officers should be appointed in writing by the wing/instal-
lation commander.


2.2.7 Should be “crew counterparts” (i.e., pilots for the families of pilots, navigators for the families of
navigators, squadron members, etc) whenever practical. CAUTION: Before recommending a FLO to the
wing/installation commander for appointment, the unit commander should make every effort to determine
the recommended individual is not too close to the situation (i.e., dealing with own grief) to be effective
in assisting the family.


2.2.8. May be senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 or higher) to support the family of an enlisted mem-
ber.


2.2.9. May be Guardsmen, Reservists, or AF civilian personnel. (Consult with civilian personnel special-
ist before appointment of a civilian FLO to ensure compliance with possible duty restrictions.)


2.2.17. Will keep a log documenting time, place, duration, and subjects covered, etc. for each contact with
the family. FLOs will maintain contact with the Mortuary Affairs Officer/NCO and provide updates as
requested by that office. This log will be turned into the Mortuary Affairs Officer/NCO for filing in the
Mortuary Case File (when a case file is opened) upon completion of FLO duties.

2.6.3. Base-level Family Support Centers may establish contingency “Family Assistance Centers” (FAC)
following major mishaps to coordinate family-oriented activities. If established, this capability will be
included in local disaster response plans and exercised at least annually, preferably in conjunction with a
Major Accident Response Exercise (MARE). Pre-planning must include: responsibilities of FSC and sup-
porting base personnel in activating and staffing the FAC; designated facilities for FAC operations,
including communications and supply requirements; augmentee sources for 24-hour or mass casualty
operations.


2.8. The Mortuary Affairs Officer:


2.8.1. The base mortuary affairs officer is appointed by the installation commander in accordance with
AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program. The base mortuary affairs officer is the base Services com-
mander, director, or deputy who administers and executes the program for the installation commander.
The base mortuary affairs officer is specifically prohibited from being assigned to casualty notification or
family liaison officer duty.


2.8.2. The base mortuary affairs officer oversees the administration of the survivor assistance program for
the installation commander and will:


2.8.2.1. Promote survivor assistance awareness.


2.8.2.2. Facilitate FLO training.


2.8.2.3. Maintain contact with FLOs throughout the casualty process and report status/issues/progress, etc
to MAJCOM POC as required.


2.8.2.4. Obtain FLO logs and incorporate into mortuary case files (when a mortuary case file is opened).


2.8.2.5. Remind units that have lost members about the one-year anniversary condolence letters and assist
if necessary. Reminders will come from HQ USAF/ILV via MAJCOM SVs.


2.8.2.6. Obtain a copy of one-year anniversary condolence letters and file in mortuary case files.


2.8.3. Other mortuary functions are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6 of this publication.


3.1.4. Services Squadrons/Divisions will facilitate annual awareness training to wing leadership, group
and squadron commanders, and first sergeants.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                          109



6.3.1.2. AFPAM 34-261, Mortuary Services Benefits For Members Who Die While On Active Duty: this is
an extremely useful pre-need publication which should be reviewed by all FLOs prior to first contact with
family members of a deceased active duty member. It is addressed to members rather than family mem-
bers, and thus should be used as reference material rather than as a document to be provided to the family.


6.5.5. The remains of persons lost in Air Force aviation mishaps or to other causes of death which occur
outside the United States may be returned to the United States by way of the Air Force Mortuary at Dover
AFB. “Arrival ceremonies” at the aerial port of entry are not normally conducted. However, remains are
received with honor, dignity, and respect.


7.4.2. The families of persons who lose their lives in conjunction with an Air Force mishap will some-
times be accorded the same opportunities for family liaison officers and investigation information flow
accorded all other categories of personnel discussed in this instruction. For example, a FLO would gener-
ally be utilized to assist the surviving family of a private citizen killed while flying as an authorized pas-
senger aboard an Air Force aircraft for official purposes.

Dear Mrs. Doe
    A year has passed since we lost your husband, Major John Doe. We remember his contribution to the
Air Force and still mourn his loss. I want you to know that you will always be a part of the Air Force fam-
ily. We remain committed to providing you the most professional, timely, and compassionate assistance
whenever required. Major _______ will call you in the next few weeks to see if we can be of any assis-
tance at this time.
    I also want to remind you about the Air Force Survivor Assistance Office. That office is the single
point of contact in the Air Force that marshals all available resources together to help families. You can
reach them by calling their toll free number 1-877-USAFHELP (1-877-872-3435), or by email
(http://survivorassistance.afsv.af.mil). Please feel free to contact me by writing or calling (000) 555-1234,

   vices for the family as well as the unit.
   A16.1.4. (Added-ANG) Confirm member’s religious preference for each involved member from the

   ment 7) or if base-level support of such an effort will be required.
A16.2. (Added-ANG) During the casualty notification:
   A16.2.1. (Added-ANG) Allow the official representative to actually deliver the casualty/death noti-
   fication. Under NO circumstances will the chaplain deliver the notification.
   A16.2.2. (Added-ANG) Provide spiritual support to family members and notification team as
   needed. Pay attention to the mental state of all family members in attendance. If you think profes-
   sional intervention or counseling may be warranted, ask a medical officer or mental health provider to
   accompany you to your next meeting to obtain an expert opinion regarding the possible need for refer-
   ral to other service providers.
   A16.2.3. (Added-ANG) Avoid the following topics if at all possible:
      A16.2.3.1. (Added-ANG) How insurance payments and arrears of pay will be handled.

      A16.3.1. (Added-ANG) Participate in/or schedule a one-on-one defusing session for each of the
      casualty notification team members, including yourself ASAP.
A16.4. (Added-ANG) Once casualty notification has been completed:
      A16.4.1. (Added-ANG) Determine if there are unresolved questions or issues that need to be
      addressed for the family as well as the unit members.
      A16.4.2. (Added-ANG) Understand the proper role of subject matter experts in all of the following
      functions: Casualty Affairs; Mortuary Affairs; The Chaplain Service; Critical Incident Stress Manage-
      ment; Summary Court Process; Memorials and Commemorations; Safety Investigations (SE); Acci-
      dent Investigations; Legal Assistance (JA); Military and Civilian Personnel Flights, including Human
      Resources Offices; Family Support Centers; Mental Health Care.
      A16.4.3. (Added-ANG) Make a point of getting to know the various Air Force people, such the casu-
      alty assistance representative (CAR) and the mortuary affairs officer, who are responsible for provid-
      ing information and services to family members. Sit in on their briefings if the family will let you --
      doing so can help you understand any possible confusion or disagreements that might arise.
      A16.4.4. (Added-ANG) Determine how often you need to meet with the Family Liaison Officer,
      Mortuary Affairs Officer/NCO, Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR), Group Commander,
      Wing Commander or other parties on the status of your dealings with the family.
      A16.4.5. (Added-ANG) Consult with Wing Commander for proposals for base memorial services.
      A16.4.6. (Added-ANG) Stay vigilant as to the needs of the family. Your frequent contact with them
      puts you in the best position to make recommendations for further assistance for them.
      A16.4.7. (Added-ANG) Consult with the section(s) affected by the death. Determine what the needs
      are of the personnel in the section and consult with command as to the recommended actions.
A16.5. (Added-ANG) ANG Chaplain Duties Involved with Traumatic Death:
      A16.5.1. (Added-ANG) Determine if the circumstances surrounding the death are due to suicide, ter-
      rorist attack, air crash, disaster or mass fatality.
      A16.5.2. (Added-ANG) Make a point of getting to know the various sections involved with the loss,
      and immediately advise the Wing Commander concerning chaplain services for the affected sections.
      A16.5.3. (Added-ANG) Some typical interventions which have proven to be helpful are:
         A16.5.3.1. (Added-ANG) Provide for a Commander’s Call that incorporates elements of a Crisis
         Management Briefing that provides information on the incident, as well as possible traumatic
         reactions and possible referral resources. Emphasis should be placed on confidentiality.
         A16.5.3.2. (Added-ANG) Provide an opportunity for individuals to meet confidentially with a
         chaplain to discuss personal reactions to the trauma.
         A16.5.3.3. (Added-ANG) Provide an opportunity for individuals to participate in a brief group
         defusing process with a chaplain or a mental health professional.
         A16.5.3.4. (Added-ANG) For more traumatic situations, provision can be made for a more
         in-depth group critical incident stress debriefing with a chaplain and a mental health team mem-
         ber.
AFI34-1101_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                       117


      A16.5.3.5. (Added-ANG) Be available to provide one-on-one crisis intervention strategies as
      needed.
   A16.5.4. (Added-ANG) ANG Chaplains should be able to provide the names of telephone numbers
   of local mental health resource providers that can help individuals work through any traumatic stress
   reactions that may occur for unit personnel. They should be thoroughly familiar with services pro-
   vided through the local unit, TRICARE, the Veterans Administration and Military OneSource.
   A16.5.5. (Added-ANG) Because most ANG chaplains are traditional guard chaplains they have lim-
   ited contact with unit members. ANG chaplains serve their members best when they employ the skills
   of spiritual, emotional & psychological first-aid, coupled with a thorough knowledge of available
   referral resources. It is vital that chaplains understand their role as confidant, advisor, mentor, sup-
   porter, and spiritual leader within the ANG community. To attempt to provide on-going, long-term
   counseling services with unit members does them a disservice.
A16.6. (Added-ANG) Suggestions for ANG Chaplains
   A16.6.1. (Added-ANG) Know the kinds of personal assistance most frequently of value to families
   following a sudden death: Companionship; Transportation; Housekeeping; Child or Elder Care; Tele-
   phone Message-Taking; Meal Preparation.
   A16.6.2. (Added-ANG) Understand the “stages of grief” which typically follow a sudden death.
   A16.6.3. (Added-ANG) Understand the signs of extreme distress or possible mental disorder, which
   may require professional intervention.
   A16.6.4. (Added-ANG) Know that base support organizations (medical, transportation, legal, chap-
   lain, personnel, and others) have points of contact to assist family members in specialized require-
   ments as well as provide for long term information and assistance.
   A16.6.5. (Added-ANG) Know that the PA can help the chaplains inform the families as to what their
   rights and responsibilities are regarding media queries, and also about what the pitfalls are. The PAOs
   can provide a valuable service as they remind the chaplains of the realities and methods of media.
   Public affairs personnel can also serve to assist and/or escort family members as desired when con-
   ducting interviews with the media. Some public affairs personnel are also cross-trained with the Chap-
   lains as part of the Chaplain Emergency Response Team (CERT).
