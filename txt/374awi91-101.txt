       discovering any hangar door discrepancy.
       3.3.5. Report all hangar door discrepancies to the respective facility manager
       immediately.
       3.3.6. Not operate any powered hangar doors in manual mode unless properly trained
       and authorized.
4. Training and Certification.
    4.1. Personnel who routinely work in hangars (but are not required to operate hangar doors)
    must receive hangar door awareness training. Hangar door awareness training is provided by
    the member’s work center and annual training completion will be documented on the
    member’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record.
    4.2. Personnel who work in hangars or are required to operate hangar doors in the
    performance of routine duties must be trained and certified to perform hangar door
    operations. Maintenance personnel required to operate hangar doors will have the G081
    course code for hangar door operation loaded as a work center training requirement (course
    code YOKP 0001 or YOKP 0005).
    4.3. Hangar door operators in the 374 MXG will be identified on a special certification roster
    (SCR). Hangar door operators in other units will be identified in writing by their respective
    squadron commander.
    4.4. Hangar door operation training will be accomplished by the operator’s work center.
    Squadron Commanders will identify highly proficient hangar door operators as hangar door
    trainers. A completed AMC Form 64, Request for Special Certification, will be routed to the
    unit training manager (UTM) upon completion of training to document the training
    appointment. Maintenance group UTMs will update completion of training for MXG
    personnel in G081. Contractors who are required to operate hangar doors to fulfill their
    contractual duties will receive training from the government after award of the contract and
    prior to initiating work in hangar facilities. The Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) or
    Contract Officer Representative (COR) for the awarded contract is responsible for arranging
    this training.
5. Hangar Door Operation.
    5.1. Only personnel identified in writing as hangar door operators by their respective
    commanders may operate hangar doors. Hangar door operators must be listed on the posted
    hangar door operators list for the hangar door being operated.
    5.2. Hangar doors must be operated IAW the local checklist posted for the hangar door being
    operated. Only the checklist identified for that specific hangar door will be used to operate
    that respective hangar door.
    5.3. All overhead hangar doors will be fully opened before aircraft are moved through the
    door entrance. Horizontal sliding doors will be completely opened for maximum clearance at
    each wingtip. Follow additional applicable guidelines in AFOSHSTD 91-100.
374AWI91-101 31 AUGUST 2009                                                                 5


   5.4. Manual hangar doors will be opened a minimum of 10 feet between adjacent door
   panels before equipment, vehicles, or personnel move through the entrance Under normal
   conditions, powered hangar or shelter doors will always be opened to a width of at least 10
   feet. For special operations, such as during extreme weather conditions, the door may be
   opened less than 10 feet only if the door control switch is locked off or out and remains
   locked out until the door can be opened to 10 feet or more or be closed.
   5.5. If a powered hangar door fails to operate properly, the door operator will inform the
   respective squadron’s supervision and the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) of the
   problem and await assistance.
   5.6. Powered hangar doors will be operated manually only by qualified personnel (CE, Fire
   Department or contractor) during routine maintenance or in the event of a facility ground
   emergency.
