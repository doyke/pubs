SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Instruction title has
been changed to more accurately reflect document contents. This revision establishes exercise
management products and organizations directed in Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-13
(paragraph 1.3.5); implements Service NEP participation directed in DoDI 3020.47,
(paragraph 1.3.6); eliminates Chapter 2 (Responsibilities) and incorporates revised exercise
program responsibilities into Chapter 1 (paragraph 1.4); removes the following chapters:
Chapter 4 (Master Scenario Event List (MSEL)), Chapter 5 (Air Force After-Action Reporting
System (AFAARS)), Chapter 6 (Air Force Remedial Action Program (AFRAP)), Chapter 7
(Staff and Training). The new Chapter 2 (Exercise Cycle) incorporates MSEL information
(paragraph 2.2.7) and After Action Reporting (AAR) guidance (paragraph 2.4). The new
Chapter 3 (Exercise Funding and Programming) provides new guidance regarding Service
Incremental Funding (SIF), Commercial Ticket Program (CTP), and Port Handling/Inland
Transportation (PH/IT) procedures based on consolidating NEP/JEP funding into the Office of
the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2)
program. The new Chapter 4 identifies prescribed and adopted forms. The Instruction also
adds Attachments 2, 3, and 4 addressing the AFJECT, EIPT, and EGOSG.

(AETC) This supplement replaces AETCI 10-205, AETC Exercise Program, in its entirety and
aligns the HQ AETC exercise program under appropriate Directorates. This supplement must be
reviewed in its entirety. It defines HQ AETC/A3OX as the HQ AETC OPR for exercises that
cross functional areas. HQ AETC/A3OX will also serve as the interface for exercises involving
Headquarters Air Force (HAF). It establishes and defines objectives for the HQ AETC Exercise
Program. This supplement provides specific details to command Emergency Management (EM)
exercise requirements IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program
Planning and Operations, adds Active Shooter exercise criteria, operational exercise
requirements and defines requirements for Master Scenario Event List (MSELs), After Action

                                            Chapter 1

                    EXERCISE GUIDELINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. Exercises play an essential role in preparing United States Air Force (USAF)
forces to conduct air, space, and cyberspace operations and perform their mission essential tasks.
This Instruction provides direction and additional policy guidance regarding Air Force
participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP) and the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
(CJCS)-designated exercises that constitute the Joint Exercise Program (JEP). It supports the
Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training, CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual for
the Armed Forces of the United States, and CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and
Guidance for the Armed Forces of the United States. It defines actions and responsibilities
during the exercise cycle and outlines procedures for programming and budgeting exercise
funds. It establishes organizations and processes to help manage Air Force NEP/JEP exercise
participation and support.
1.1. (AETC)Purpose. As HAF guidance for installation-level exercises is limited, this
supplement will serve as AETC guidance to installation-level exercises. This core AFI, despite
that it is geared toward Joint and National exercises, embodies many installation-level exercise
concepts. This supplement lays the foundation for the HQ AETC Exercise Program. The
purpose of the HQ AETC Exercise Program is to support the Air Force Exercise Program and
provide guidance and policy to IEPOs.
1.2. Objective. Air Force units participate in NEP and JEP exercises to hone and refine their
execution of mission essential and supporting tasks, validate training, improve response
capabilities, and enhance and evaluate readiness. The Air Force goal is to optimize the benefits
of participating in these exercises.
1.2. (AETC)Objective. Establish HQ AETC/A3OX as AETC’s centralized agency for
standardized installation exercise procedures and policies IAW DoD and AF directives, as well
as HQ AETC/CC direction. In order to enhance effective planning and coordination,
installations tasked to support and/or participate in National Exercise Program (NEP) or Joint
Exercise Program (JEP) exercises will notify HQ AETC/A3OX within 20 calendar days of
exercise tasking via email from the IEPO Chief.
1.2. (KEESLERAFB)Objective. The objective of the 81 TRW Installation Exercise Program
Office (IEPO) is to enhance readiness and combat capability, streamline procedures, and
improve systems support. The Wing Commander uses the IEPO and Exercise Evaluation Team
(EET) to assess the wing’s ability to perform its contingency missions and capabilities.
However, exercises are not a substitute for unit contingency training.
1.3. Exercise Guidelines.
     1.3.1. Concept. Exercises must embody a “train the way we fight” philosophy and should
     exercise actual command relationships as much as possible. Exercises should provide
     opportunities to assess real-world capabilities consistent with safety, security, and overall
     exercise objectives. When appropriate, exercises should also incorporate other requirements
     and operational challenges, such as logistics, support, force protection, and the ability to
     operate in a degraded/contaminated environment, including biological, radiological, and
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                                7


  nuclear (CBRN) environments. Whenever possible, exercises should seek to employ and
  evaluate current or proposed plans, policies, procedures, processes, Warfighter Challenges,
  and doctrine.
  1.3.1. (AETC) Concept. Exercise planners should strive to replicate the operational
  environment as closely as possible for all exercise events. In order for the players to achieve
  the appropriate exercise objectives, simulations should be kept to a minimum and used only
  when real world procedures create excessive risk or prohibitive expense.
  1.3.2. Conditions. Exercises give commanders an opportunity to assess the ability of their
  units to perform their missions and should be conducted and examined under “no-fault”
  conditions. Exercise participants should have the “freedom to fail” within the bounds of safe
  operations and the need to meet exercise objectives. Per CJCSI 3500.01E, assessments for
  CE2 exercise will be recorded in the Joint Training Information Management System
  (JTIMS). Unless part of a formal inspection, do not grade individual or unit performance.
  Formal inspections, such as operational readiness inspections (ORIs), may be conducted
  during exercises provided graded events are clearly identified to all exercise participants and
  grading will only affect inspected units.
  1.3.2. (AETC) Conditions. Unless otherwise directed by the installation commander, HQ
  AETC-directed and installation exercises will be graded.          For efficiencies and
  standardization, recommend using HQ AETC Inspector General (IG) grading criteria.
  1.3.3. Linking Exercises. To take advantage of the synergy that exists when exercises
  require similar skill sets and have common venues, scenarios, and objectives, Air Force
  Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting
  Units (DRUs) should consider linking their sponsored exercises with CJCS-sponsored,
  CCDR-sponsored, or other appropriate exercises whenever possible.
  1.3.3. (AETC) Linking Exercises. If possible, installations should use NEP or JEP
  exercises and other required training to fulfill some of the exercise requirements contained in
  Emergency Management, Medical, Force Protection, Information Protection, tenant unit
  exercise requirements, etc.
     1.3.3.1. Scheduling. Participating in NEP and JEP exercises and also supporting Air
     Force-sponsored exercises places considerable stress on Air Force units and often strains
     available assets. Force providers must determine their ability to support all exercise
     requirements as they develop their exercise schedules and make exercise commitments.
     1.3.3.1. (AETC) Scheduling. Installation Commanders, in coordination with the IEPO
     Chief, will ensure all required exercises are scheduled and executed IAW applicable
     directives and timelines. HQ AETC/A3OX will assist this requirement by documenting
     and posting all “known” exercise requirements on the HQ AETC Operations, Plans and
     Programs Community of Practice. Units and Functionals can assist this requirement
     through cross-flow of information to A3OX when exercise requirements are added or
     deleted in functional AFIs. Annual installation exercise schedules for the next calendar
     year will be submitted by the IEPO Chief to A3OX by 15 Dec of the current year. Plan
     and develop an annual exercise schedule to the example below (Figure 1.1).

     1.3.4. Support Requirements.
        1.3.4.1. Participants. Exercises provide participants the opportunity to practice actions
        and procedures in an instructive environment. To ensure the appropriate personnel
        benefit from this exercise experience, role players and substitutes for key personnel
        should be kept to a minimum.
        1.3.4.2. War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM may be used to provide Indirect Mission
        Support for Joint Chiefs of Staff and Air Force exercises with proper
        approval/authorization and funding, as outlined in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel
        (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. WRM assets will not be used for exercises
        without appropriate release authority.
        1.3.4.3. Preparation. Exercise planners should review operational, logistical, support,
        and force protection requirements, command relationships, applicable plans, After
        Actions Reports (AAR), lessons learned databases, corrective action reports, observation
        reports, and guidance from higher headquarters to determine appropriate exercise
        objectives and ensure the exercise design supports meeting these objectives.
        1.3.4.4. Environmental Compliance. Exercise sponsors will ensure exercises conducted
        in the United States, its territories, and possessions comply with applicable Federal, State,
        interstate, and local environmental requirements. Air Force exercise planners will ensure
        compliance with AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) for
        all Air Force-sponsored exercises. Exercises conducted at Department of Defense (DoD)
        installations in foreign countries will comply with AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program
        in Foreign Countries.
        1.3.4.5. Contractor Support for Exercises. The contract statement of work is the source
        document for contractor duties and responsibilities. Contractor support for exercises
        must be confined to the services specified by contract or negotiated during the exercise
        planning process.
        1.3.4.5. (AETC) The IEPO Chief will coordinate with the installation Contracting
        Officer and Judge Advocate staff during exercise development if a contracted function is
        to be exercised and evaluated. The following paragraphs outline several required
        safeguards to be used when evaluating contracted activities during exercises to prevent
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                              9


     claims and protests resulting from exercising and evaluating contracted functions. The
     IEPO Chief will:
        1.3.4.5.1. (Added-AETC) Request, from the contracting officer or the contracting
        Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) member, the Statement of Work/Performance Work
        Statement and associated contract documents from the inspected unit.
        1.3.4.5.2. (Added-AETC) Develop contract evaluation areas in coordination with
        the contracting officer or the contracting EET member.
        1.3.4.5.3. (Added-AETC) Consult the contracting officer or the contracting EET
        member when contract interpretation is necessary.
        1.3.4.5.4. (Added-AETC) Ensure the contracting officer and/or Contracting Officer
        Representative (COR) accompany the EET member during exercise evaluations.
        1.3.4.5.5. (Added-AETC) When feasible, provide a copy of their exercise schedule
        to the contractor’s project manager through the contracting officer to avoid
        unreasonable interruptions of contractor performance. The exercise schedule will
        also be provided to the COR.
        1.3.4.5.6. (Added-AETC) Ensure EET members do not direct contractor
        performance or direct the contractor to correct deficiencies. If an EET member notes
        an imminent danger to personnel or equipment, he or she will take immediate action
        to mitigate the hazard and notify the contracting officer.
        1.3.4.5.7. (Added-AETC) Ensure contract compliance is validated with the COR
        and the contracting officer/administrator.
        1.3.4.5.8. (Added-AETC) Ensure the AAR for contracted activities exercised
        includes these evaluated areas:
            1.3.4.5.8.1. (Added-AETC) Government Oversight. This area will include all
            contractor surveillance responsibilities, including but not limited to, the COR and
            any associated processes and surveillance documents, functional commanders,
            and interface with contracting personnel.
            1.3.4.5.8.2. (Added-AETC) Mission Impact. Include a subjective assessment
            of the value added to the mission by the contracted activity.
            1.3.4.5.8.3. (Added-AETC) Contractor Performance/Compliance.                 This
            includes an assessment of contractor compliance with contract terms and
            conditions. Deficiencies in this area will reference the governing contract.
            Specific comments regarding contractor performance will be included under a
            separate contractor report. The unit (or responsible organization) contracting
            office is responsible for addressing performance issues with the contractor.
        1.3.4.5.9. (Added-AETC) Ensure contractor performance/compliance reports are
        not released to the contractor.
        1.3.4.5.10. (Added-AETC) Commanders must reply to answerable contractor
        performance/ compliance deficiencies in exercise reports. The respective contracting
        officer is the Office of Collateral Responsibility and will coordinate on the reply. At
        minimum, replies will address formal government actions taken by the contracting
10                            AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


           officer in response to contractor deficiencies. Only contracting officers are
           authorized to direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during exercise
           evaluations.
           1.3.4.5.11. (Added-AETC) Ensure details of individual contractor performance are
           not included in any out-brief.
        1.3.4.6. Status of Forces Agreement for Combined Exercises. Whenever USAF forces
        participate with other countries in any combined exercise, the United States should have a
        status of forces agreement (SOFA) or similar arrangement with all participating
        countries. If a SOFA does not exist with any country, such an agreement should be
        negotiated and concluded in advance of the exercise in accordance with DoD Directive
        (DoDD) 5530.3, International Agreements, AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding,
        Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements, and AFJI 51-706, Status of Forces
        Policies, Procedures, and Information. If in doubt as to the existence of such an
        agreement with regard to a particular country or for assistance in preparing an agreement,
        contact Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the General Counsel, Deputy General
        Counsel for International Affairs (SAF/GCI).
     1.3.5. Exercise Management. The Air Force will develop the following products and use
     the following organizations to optimize exercise support and participation.
        1.3.5.1. Exercise Management Products.
           1.3.5.1.1. Weight of Effort (WoE). The WoE is a prioritized scoring matrix
           developed to assist Air Force senior leaders in making personnel and equipment
           apportionment decisions for exercise support functions, such as Air and Space
           Operations Center (AOC) augmentation, exercise control group support, and
           modeling and simulation (M&S) support. The WoE utilizes quantitative grading
           criteria to identify which exercises provide the greatest training benefit for USAF
           units. The WoE is not intended to be used for prioritization of funding.
           1.3.5.1.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES). The GES is the annual schedule of
           exercises requiring support from Air Force exercise control and M&S organizations.
           Air Combat Command (ACC) develops and maintains the GES.
        1.3.5.2. Exercise Management Organizations.
           1.3.5.2.1. Air Force Joint Exercise Coordination Team (AFJECT). The AFJECT is
           an action officer-level working group responsible for developing a validated GES.
           Additional guidance is at Attachment 2.
           1.3.5.2.2. Exercise Integrated Process Team (EIPT). The EIPT is a multi-command,
           colonel-level organization responsible for coordinating and addressing cross-
           MAJCOM exercise issues and developing the WoE. Additional guidance is at
           Attachment 3.
           1.3.5.2.3. Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG). The EGOSG is an
           executive level forum to address exercise-related issues and AF support to CSAF,
           Combatant Commander (CCDR), and MAJCOM/CC exercise requirements and
           priorities. Additional guidance is at Attachment 4.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                              11


  1.3.6. National Exercise Program (NEP). DoD Components will support the NEP in
  accordance with DoDI 3020.47, DoD Participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP).
     1.3.6.1. Scope. The NEP is run by the Department of Homeland Security and provides a
     framework for prioritizing and focusing Federal exercise activities. It is the principal
     mechanism for examining the overall preparedness of the United States Government
     (USG) and enables Federal departments and agencies to examine and evaluate national
     policies, plans, and strategies during the management of domestic catastrophic events,
     such as CBRN incidents, as a result of attack or natural disaster.
     1.3.6.2. Tiers. The NEP Implementation Plan categorizes exercises into the following
     tiers that reflect priorities for interagency participation:
        1.3.6.2.1. Tier I. This is the highest priority level. Tier I exercises are centered on
        White House directed, USG-wide issues and require the participation of appropriate
        department and agency principals along with their operations centers and staffs.
        1.3.6.2.2. Tier II. These are Federal department/agency exercises with a focus on
        USG strategy, policy, and procedural issues meriting priority for national and
        regional Federal interagency participation. Each department or agency will determine
        their level of actual or simulated support for NEP Tier II exercises.
        1.3.6.2.3. Tier III. These are other Federal exercises focused on plans, policies and
        procedures at the regional, operational, or tactical level not requiring broad
        interagency headquarters-level involvement. Participation at the national level is at
        the discretion of each department or agency.
        1.3.6.2.4. Tier IV. These are exercises in which State and local government, and/or
        private sector entities are the primary exercise audience.
     1.3.6.3. National Level Exercise (NLE). The NLE is the single annual operations-based
     NEP Tier I exercise and requires the participation of all appropriate department and
     agency principals.
     1.3.6.4. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) serves as the DoD POC to the
     NEP and orchestrates overall DoD NEP execution.
        1.3.6.4.1. The Air Force will participate in NEP Tier I exercises when appropriate
        given the scenario or when tasked by either the ASD (HD&ASA) or by CJCS or his
        or her representative.
        1.3.6.4.2. Unless directed by higher authority, Air Force participation in Tier II, III,
        and IV NEP exercises is at the discretion of MAJCOM and unit leadership.
        1.3.6.4.3. A tasked MAJCOM will notify AF/A3O-ATT and the requesting agency
        when they cannot provide requested exercise support to any NEP exercise.
     1.3.6.5. AF/A3O-ATT will monitor Air Force participation in NEP exercises.
     1.3.6.6. Air Force organizations that participate in a NEP exercise will:
        1.3.6.6.1. Fully support exercise planning, execution, and evaluation.
        1.3.6.6.2. Provide trusted agents, as needed, to design and control the exercise.

                                             Chapter 2

                                        EXERCISE CYCLE

2.1. Exercise Cycle. The exercise cycle consists of the planning, execution, and evaluation
phases needed to create, conduct and assess an exercise.
2.2. Planning Phase. The planning phase encompasses all aspects of building an exercise and
as a minimum should address the following areas:
2.2. (AETC)Planning Phase.
      2.2.1. Exercise concept. The exercise concept guides and focuses the planning effort. It
      identifies the exercise type (e.g. command post exercise (CPX), field training exercise (FTX),
      etc.), the major participants, the level of exercise play, the broad scenario profile and the
      plans, procedures, and activities that are the primary exercise focus.
   2.2.1. (AETC) Exercise concept. Pre-Exercise Briefing: The EET Chief will conduct a
   pre-exercise briefing for EET members. EET members will not disclose objectives and
   sequence of events to parties who do not have a need to know. Use the AETC EET Guide to
   plan and conduct pre-exercise briefings.
   2.2.2. Exercise objectives. Exercise objectives are the precise, action-oriented statements
   that identify the goals for the exercise. Objectives should be developed around tasks from
   applicable Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs). When participating in linked exercises,
   Air Force exercise objectives should be compatible with those of the other exercise(s).
   2.2.2. (AETC) Exercise objectives. Wing XP (or equivalent), in conjunction with the
   Crisis Action Team (CAT) Coordinator and CAT members, will develop exercise objectives
   and inputs for the CAT.
         2.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) Unit Commanders and Wing Staff agencies, in conjunction
         with respective EET members, will review and develop exercise objectives that are
         executable, can be validated, improve response capabilities, and enhance readiness IAW
         functional requirements.
   2.2.3. Exercise plans (EXPLANs). EXPLANs should typically follow the standard
   Operations Plan (OPLAN) format found in CJCSM 3122.03C, Joint Operation Planning and
   Execution System (JOPES), Vol II--Planning Formats and Guidance, and contain pertinent
   annexes. When appropriate, participating Air Force organizations (HAF, MAJCOM, etc)
   will assist the exercise sponsor with EXPLAN development. Depending on exercise
   complexity, duration and level of participation, Air Force organizations may, at their
   discretion, create an organizational EXPLAN to clarify exercise requirements and
   responsibilities.
   2.2.3. (AETC) Exercise plans (EXPLANs). IEPOs will develop an installation Exercise
   Plan (EXPLAN), OI or supplement to this instruction within 180 days of the publication date
   of this supplement. EXPLAN or OI development is recommended as these can be updated
   faster than a supplement.
   2.2.4. Exercise control. Exercise execution is managed by controllers who are
   knowledgeable in the timing and content of exercise events. Air Force planners should
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                             21


  determine the number and location of control elements and the exercise control procedures
  needed to provide overall exercise management and support the accomplishment of Air Force
  objectives. Planners should prepare and provide exercise controllers the support materials
  needed to manage exercise execution.
  2.2.4. (AETC) Exercise control. An exercise control staff consists of an EET Chief, White
  Cell Chief Controller, EET, White Cell staff, Trusted Agents or other personnel as necessary.
  In many instances, manpower restrictions will dictate modifications.
  2.2.5. Training. Exercises are a training program adjunct and provide an opportunity to
  practice trained actions and procedures during simulated situations in a controlled
  environment. Exercise organizations must determine the training their exercise players
  require to properly prepare them for a particular exercise and then ensure the training is
  accomplished before the exercise.
     2.2.5.1. (Added-AETC) The IEPO Chief, in coordination with the Functional EET,
     should review governing exercise AFIs to determine applicable training requirements.
     2.2.5.2. (Added-AETC) The IEPO Chief will work with the installation Emergency
     Management Branch to ensure EET members complete required training.
     2.2.5.3. (Added-AETC) EET Chief will ensure exercise controllers are trained to
     successfully carry out exercise responsibilities.
     2.2.5.4. (Added-AETC) EET members will complete initial training in the Advanced
     Distributed Learning System at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil, under Emergency
     Management. Training must be complete within 60 calendar days of appointment.
     2.2.5.5. (Added-AETC) Personnel will not act as evaluators during exercises unless
     appointed by unit commander and all required EET training is complete.
     2.2.5.6. (Added-AETC) Additional training requirements, as directed by the
     installation, will depend on each member’s functional expertise and which exercises they
     will assess.
     2.2.5.7. (Added-AETC) All unit and group-level EET members should take Unit
     Control Center (UCC) web-based training and localized training.
     2.2.5.8. (Added-AETC) For Deployment Exercises, readiness evaluators must be able
     to use the AF IMT 2511, Deployment Schedule of Events - Cargo, AF IMT 2511A,
     Deployment Schedule of Events - Passenger, and AF IMT 2512, Deployment Schedule of
     Events – Loading Schedule as backup for developing and disseminating manual
     Deployment Schedule of Events, in the event the Logistics Module application is
     unavailable or network limitations prevent its use. (See AFI 10-403, Deployment
     Planning and Execution.)        Additionally, evaluators must review the installation
     deployment plan to determine how the IMT forms will be used as a back-up during
     contingencies and inspections as well as work with the installation deployment officer to
     review the manual process, which is required prior to facilitating/evaluating an exercise.
  2.2.6. Exercise Player Materials. One of the goals of the exercise program is to practice,
  validate, and reinforce established procedures. To help support this goal, whenever possible,
  exercise information should be communicated using established procedures. Exercise-
22                            AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


     specific player materials should only be created when normal communication tools or
     procedures do not exist to provide required exercise information.
        2.2.6.1. Exercise player material must not divulge trusted agent information or release
        any event information before the scheduled time of the event.
  2.2.7. Master Scenario Event List (MSEL). Typically, the MSEL is a chronological
  database of planned events and expected player actions that exercise controllers use to
  manage and guide the exercise to achieve exercise objectives.
        2.2.7.1. The MSEL is the scenario game plan for the exercise and should only be
        accessible to trusted agents and must not be released to exercise players.
        2.2.7.1. (AETC) The MSEL will list chronological events by the inject date and time
        group and contain at least one MSEL event for each objective, with a determination of
        how and when to inject the event, as well as who would most logically cause or report the
        event. The MSEL will also reflect all munitions, smoke-generating devices or ground-
        burst simulators planned for use and name of the individual responsible for initiating the
        pyrotechnic device during the exercise.
        2.2.7.2. The exercise sponsoring organization is responsible for directing and overseeing
        MSEL development and creating and maintaining the MSEL database.
           2.2.7.2.1. Trusted agents from participating Air Force organizations will review the
           MSEL and ensure planned events support Air Force objectives.
               2.2.7.2.1.1. Air Force planners will coordinate on events that require Air Force
               participation and, when appropriate, create or change events to meet Air Force
               exercise requirements.
               2.2.7.2.1.2. When necessary, planners will attend MSEL Development and/or
               Synchronization Conferences to oversee scenario development and execution
               coordination.
  2.2.8. Trusted Agents. Trusted agents are subject matter experts who are given advance
  knowledge of exercise scenario details for the purpose of assisting with exercise development
  and planning.
        2.2.8.1. To maintain the integrity of exercise information, organizations should limit the
        number of trusted agents to the absolute minimum required to support proper planning.
           2.2.8.1.1. To maintain exercise planning continuity, trusted agents should be capable
           of serving from the start of exercise planning through execution.
           2.2.8.1.2. Trusted agents should not be principal players during exercise execution
           since advance knowledge of exercise events can significantly decrease the benefit
           players receive from an exercise.
        2.2.8.2. As a minimum, trusted agent information is For Official Use Only and should
        remain close-hold within the exercise planning community. Exercise information should
        not be released outside the planning community without the approval of the primary
        planning staff of the sponsoring organization for an exercise.

   2.2.9. Exercise planners. Planners must be knowledgeable in the procedures, plans, and
   processes being exercised.
       2.2.9.1. The following references provide detailed information on the Joint Training
       System (JTS) and the Joint Event Life Cycle (JELC) and can assist exercise planners in
       the design, conduct and evaluation of exercises:
           2.2.9.1.1. CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and Guidance for the Armed
           Forces of the United States.
           2.2.9.1.2. CJCSI 3500.02, Universal Joint Task List Policy and Guidance for the
           Armed Forces of the United States.
           2.2.9.1.3. CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual (JTM) for the Armed Forces of
           the United States.
   2.2.10. Observers. Observers are a vital link in the exercise process. They ensure exercise
   objectives are met, provide on-the-spot instruction and capture lessons learned and/or best
   practices for the after-action report and inclusion in the Joint Lessons Learned Information
   System (JLLIS). They can also recommend and coordinate event changes when required
   during exercise execution.
   2.2.11. Communication and Testing. Communication Setup and Testing are important
   exercise preparation steps and should include validation of all certifications and
   accreditations, end-to-end communications checks, and systems interoperability verification.
   2.2.12. (Added-AETC) Training Aids. HQ AETC wings are only permitted to use inert
   simulated training weapons for exercise purposes when exercising in populated areas or
   using “role players” as perpetrators. All exercise participants, including first responders,
   must use inert simulated training weapons made of rubber or plastic, red or blue in color and
   clearly marked “Training Aid.” No other forms of simulated training weapons are
   authorized. Exception: Non-players. (Non-Player is anyone outside the established cordon,
   not including those guarding the cordon.)
2.3. Execution Phase. The formal execution phase begins with deployment of exercise
participants or STARTEX and continues until ENDEX.
2.3. (AETC)Execution Phase. The EET Chief will obtain installation commander approval
before establishing or conducting an exercise. The commander will determine appropriate levels
of participation for personnel directly involved in training operations. This will ensure exercises
are as effective as possible without negative impact on the primary training mission. Brief the
airfield operations flight commander at least 48 hours in advance of an exercise that will involve
an air traffic control facility or airport movement area. The airfield operations flight commander
must approve, in advance, exercises that move controllers to alternate facilities or shelter areas.
Execute the exercise scenario on the date and time planned or as modified by the EET Chief.
Once an exercise begins, it continues until all objectives have been met and, with the EET
Chief’s recommendation, the installation commander terminates. Ideally, the scenario should
proceed to a logical end point. However, the EET Chief or installation commander may
terminate the exercise early in the event safety concerns or conflicting real-world emergencies
arise, or when all exercise objectives are met.

     2.3.1. Controllers manage the direction, pace, and intensity of exercise play in accordance
     with the exercise control plan established by the exercise sponsoring organization.
        2.3.1.1. When required, an Air Force Exercise Control Group (AFECG) will oversee and
        manage the exercise activity of Air Force exercise participants.
            2.3.1.1.1. The AFECG will not include exercise players and will be tailored to
            support the size and scope of the exercise and meet the exercise needs of participating
            Air Force organizations.
        2.3.1.2. White Cell. Since all organizations do not participate in every exercise, White
        Cell personnel will replicate the actions or inputs of non-participating organizations that
        are needed to keep exercise activities on track. White Cell personnel will not be exercise
        players but are trusted agents and may also perform controller functions.
        2.3.1.2. (AETC) Exercise Control Center (White Cell).
            2.3.1.2.1. (Added-AETC) Purpose. All exercises require command and control.
            The White Cell has been implemented to provide a single cell of personnel to monitor
            and control MSEL or exercise flow, act as HHQ, direct role players, enforce time
            implements, etc. The control system for any exercise should ensure that it follows the
            approved scenario, attains the minimum objectives, ensures smooth development and
            provides meaningful, realistic training to all exercise participants.
            2.3.1.2.2. (Added-AETC) Organization. To control exercises, the Chief Controller
            or Deputy IEPO Chief organizes the White Cell and uses available personnel
            effectively to provide the largest benefit to the exercise. They should possess the
            knowledge to make sound decisions if the EET Chief is unavailable. Establish
            sufficient controller work space and assign roles and responsibilities to each
            controller.
               2.3.1.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) The composition of the White Cell depends upon
               the type of exercise and the echelon at which it is conducted as well as the method
               (sometimes called the exercise implementer), which sustains the exercise and
               causes it to flow to a logical conclusion. White cell composition also depends on
               the MSEL sequence of events, simulations, role players, phone calls, faxes, e-
               mails or a combination of these that may drive an exercise as well as objectives
               from notional higher and adjacent headquarters or support agencies.
               2.3.1.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) White Cell personnel represent all higher,
               subordinate, adjacent, and support agencies not physically present on the
               installation or participating in the exercise (e.g. HAF, HHQ, etc.) The White Cell
               Chief Controller must ensure the appropriate exercise echelon is established as
               well as the appropriate personnel assigned to serve at each echelon.
               2.3.1.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) Each White Cell should be equipped with controller
               workspace, phone, computer and land mobile radio or base station, along with the
               White Cell instructions. Each White Cell should be staffed with individuals
               possessing sufficient knowledge to ensure exercise flow.
               2.3.1.2.2.4. (Added-AETC) White Cell Controllers ensure that events take place
               at the right time and place per the scenario and schedule. EET helps determine
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                                 25


               the flow of exercise incidents, Command and Control, contingency Plans,
               obstacles and support activities.
               2.3.1.2.2.5. (Added-AETC) EET reports outcomes and status of exercise
               objectives to the White Cell. EET members observe activities to determine
               whether tasks are performed to standard. Ideally, no one should serve as
               controller and EET member during the same exercise. However, based on
               manning constraints, the EET Chief may assign personnel to more than one role.
               2.3.1.2.2.6. (Added-AETC) As the focal point for controlling each exercise, the
               White Cell will portray HHQ of the player unit or installation when the
               appropriate HHQ is not participating. It will also be responsible for the
               administration and logistics necessary to support the exercise. Subordinate
               control centers, if used, will coordinate activities through White Cell if the
               installation command and control systems are not activated to support the
               exercise. For example, the White Cell may assume the role of the CAT,
               Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or other Command & Control node to
               support the accomplishment of the exercise objectives.
   2.3.2. Exercise Reporting. Exercises provide an opportunity to practice procedures and
   evaluate their effectiveness. All exercise participants, to include observers and controllers,
   should note strengths and weaknesses encountered in any area during exercise planning or
   execution and identify these using the prescribed lessons learned and after actions processes.
2.4. Evaluation Phase. The evaluation phase is a critical part of the exercise process and
enables participants to evaluate and assess exercise actions, propose changes, and share this
information with others. After Action Reports (AARs) and Lessons Learned (L2) actions are
key elements of this phase.
2.4. (KEESLERAFB)Evaluation Phase. In the evaluation phase evaluators measure and
document the exercise participants' performance in relation to the exercise objective(s).
Additionally, the evaluator records specifics with regard to strengths and commendable
performances. It is important for the evaluator to take detailed notes to support either sub-
standard or superior performances for after-action reports and debriefings. Identify any problem
areas discover during exercises that are outside the evaluator’s area of expertise and report these
incidents to the evaluator responsible for that area.
   2.4.1. AARs. Participating Air Force organizations should develop an AAR that
   summarizes exercise activities, evaluates actions, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and
   makes recommendations, as appropriate.
   2.4.1. (AETC) AARs. Participating Air Force organizations should develop an AAR that
   summarizes exercise activities, evaluates actions, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and
   makes recommendations, as appropriate. (Added) (See Attachment 5 for example AAR).
   2.4.1. (KEESLERAFB) After Actions Report. EET members will contribute any
   strengths, deficiencies, and recommended improvement areas to the IEPO Chief (or
   designated representative). These inputs will be consolidated to produce the exercise After
   Actions Report.
26                         AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


     2.4.1.1. Participating Air Force organizations will follow the guidance in AFI 90-1601,
     Air Force Lessons Learned Program, for posting and forwarding AARs.
     2.4.1.1. (AETC) AARs must be distributed to HQ AETC/A3OX NLT 20 working days
     after the exercise event. A3OX will review AARs prior to submitting to the AF Joint
     Lessons Learned Information System (AF-JLLIS.)
        2.4.1.1.1. (Added-AETC) All contingency/event AARs that do not request exercise
        credit must be submitted to AF-JLLIS by the installation NLT 30 working days
        following the event.
        2.4.1.1.2. (Added-AETC) Mark after-action reports as “FOR OFFICIAL USE
        ONLY.” Note: This report may be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of
        Information Act. Do not release or publish, in whole or in part, outside official DoD
        channels unless authorized by DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act
        Program (and appropriate subordinate supplements when applicable).
     2.4.1.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) After Actions Report Inputs.
        2.4.1.2.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Identify outstanding performers and comment
        on noteworthy areas including the impact on operations.
        2.4.1.2.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) All Finding input items will have these major
        areas within the write-up: Title, Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), tracking
        number, Observation, Discussion, and Recommendation. A short synopsis of the
        major areas contained in each Lesson Learned is listed below:
            2.4.1.2.2.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Each Finding will normally address one
            specific problem; however, when multiple discrepancies have the same "cause"
            and "solution" they may be rolled into one Finding. Each Finding will be
            unclassified or For Official Use Only. The IEPO Chief and/or the concerned
            evaluator will individually brief the responsible OPR on classified areas requiring
            corrective actions identified during evaluations.
            2.4.1.2.2.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Title. Concise subject title of the area
            requiring correction.
            2.4.1.2.2.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Office of Primary Responsibility. The
            OPR is the unit/office where corrective actions responsibility is assigned.
            2.4.1.2.2.4. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Tracking Number. Each Finding will be
            assigned a sequential number designated by the IEPO Chief. Each deficiency will
            be identified by the year, exercise number and the sequential Finding tracking
            number (e.g., BD 12-01-01).
            2.4.1.2.2.5. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Observation. Include a short factual
            statement of the observed success or problem. When used, this statement will
            identify something that happened that was not supposed to happen or something
            that did not occur but should have occurred. When writing the observations for
            the After Actions Report omit specific names, locations or other information that
            identifies individual(s).
            2.4.1.2.2.6. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Discussion. Amplifies the success or
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                                27


              problem statement and answers the “who, what, where, when, why, how and how
              much” questions. Describe in detail the actions taken to work around the problem
              by the exercise participants. When possible, specify the directive, checklist, or
              other publications that was not complied with. If a problem could not be solved
              by the participants, explain why. If the agency required to take corrective action
              is at higher headquarters, identify that agency.
              2.4.1.2.2.7. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Recommendation. A statement of how
              to permanently correct the problem and who should make the correction e.g.,
              “The Joint Staff should develop a systematic process to identify and resolve joint
              doctrine problems related to low intensity conflict.” The recommendation could
              result in a requirement for new or modified publications, procuring new
              equipment, changing force structure, revising command relationships, improving
              training, etc. This paragraph should not restate the lesson-learned paragraph. If
              no action is necessary, enter “None Required.” This should be a final solution to
              the problem that addresses the root cause.
   2.4.2. Lessons Learned. The Air Force Office of Lessons Learned (AF/A9L) is the OPR
   for the Air Force Lessons Learned Process (AFL2P).
      2.4.2.1. Unless otherwise directed by exercise protocols, all participating Air Force units
      will comply with the observation, collection, reporting, validation, dissemination, and
      tracking procedures contained in AFI 90-1601.
   2.4.3. The    Air      Force    Joint     Lessons    Learned Information System
   (https://www.jllis.mil/USAF) is the Air Force and DoD system of record for the
   management of all Air Force observations, L2, and AARs.
2.5. (Added-AETC) Requesting Exercise Credit.
   2.5.1. (Added-AETC) Installations requesting exercise credit for Contingency/Real-World
   events will submit an MFR signed by the commander or designated representative with a
   copy of the AAR to AETC/A3OX for review NLT 20 working days after the event. A3OX
   will coordinate the Contingency/Real-World exercise credit request with appropriate
   Functional Area Managers to ensure applicable credit is granted as it is earned.
   2.5.2. (Added-AETC) In order to receive exercise credit, real-world events will be
   evaluated to ensure successful completion of current exercise objectives. Additionally,
   lessons learned (strengths, deficiencies and recommended improvement areas) must be
   identified and an AAR must be accomplished and submitted to AETC/A3OX.
2.6. (Added-AETC) Hotwash/Debrief.
   2.6.1. (Added-AETC) After the exercise, the EET and trusted agents convene in a closed
   session “Hotwash” to review and assess the exercise. This initial debriefing is closed to other
   exercise participants to enable evaluators and EET members to freely discuss exercise
   activities. All deficiencies will be validated and recommended improvement areas discussed
   with exercise participants after this closed session.
   2.6.2. (Added-AETC) After the exercise, the EET Chief will critique the exercise with the
   installation commander before conducting the open session to debrief exercise participants
   (no later than 30 days after the exercise).
 28                          AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


2.7. (Added-AETC) Corrective Actions.
   2.7.1. (Added-AETC) The EET recommends revised procedures to installation
   commander. His/her designated representative or working group (e.g., the Emergency
   Management WG) should review exercise results for exercises required by AFI 10-2501 as a
   minimum and advise on appropriate corrective actions. Deficiencies will be identified to
   HHQ in AARs and are considered corrected only when corrective action is completed,
   approved by the commander or designated representative, and validated by another exercise
   or test of the applicable procedure.
   2.7.2. (Added-AETC) Unit Commander or equivalent must ensure discrepancies identified
   in AARs are corrected and must ensure a written response is provided to the IEPO Chief by
   the established suspense date. If corrective actions cannot be completed as directed, follow-
   up reports must be submitted at least monthly until corrective actions are complete. Unit
   Commanders will send response information copies to the Civil Engineer Readiness and
   Emergency Management Flight.
   2.7.2. (KEESLERAFB) Squadron/Unit Responsibilities. Will correct discrepancies
   identified in the After-Action Report and provide a written reply to 81 TRW/XPE for review
   by the suspense date established in the report. (30 calendar days after AAR signature date).
   Send info copies to the Installation Emergency Management Office.
      2.7.2.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) If corrective actions cannot be completed as directed,
      functional managers must submit follow-up reports to 81 TRW/XPE at least monthly
      until the actions are completed. Send info copies to the Installation Emergency
      Management Office.
      2.7.2.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) The deficiency reply format is attached to the AAR.
      (see Attachment 5) The deficiencies memorandum will address the following:
          2.7.2.2.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) From. OPR responsible for the deficiency.
          2.7.2.2.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Subject. Exercise name, tracking number and
          title from the AAR.
          2.7.2.2.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Deficiency. Include             the   deficiency   as   it
          appears in the AAR.
          2.7.2.2.4. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Suggested Status. The status will be listed as
          Open or Closed. In the event the status is Open and corrective actions cannot be
          completed during the initial response, replies should indicate the current status,
          provide a timeline for completing corrective actions, and provide an estimated closure
          date. Written status updates are due NLT the 3rd working day of each month until all
          corrective actions are completed. Corrective actions such as “individual has been
          briefed” or “this area will be emphasized at the next training meeting” do not
          normally provide permanent fixes to the problems identified. A better corrective
          action is to identify lesson plan changes, checklist modifications, publishing/revising
          OIs, establishing new recurring training items, something that institutionalizes a long-
          term fix, etc. Recommendations provided in deficiencies are suggested corrective
          actions, but selection of the final completed corrective action is the responsibility of
          the cited deficiency OPR.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                                  29


           2.7.2.2.5. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Estimated Closure Date. If suggested status
           is open, include the estimated closure date in the monthly status update.
           2.7.2.2.6. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Deficiency Tracking Number. A sequential
           number is assigned by the Chief, Installation Exercise Program to the deficiency in
           the AAR. The deficiency number will be identified by BD, the year, exercise number
           and the sequential Finding tracking number (i.e., BD 12-01-01).
           2.7.2.2.7. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Observation. As stated in the AAR.
           2.7.2.2.8. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Deficiency Code. All deficiencies will be
           assigned a deficiency code in the response memorandum by the OPR. See AFI 90-
           201 Table A7.1 for deficiency codes and explanations.
           2.7.2.2.9. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Action Plan and Time Line. Insert corrective
           actions here. Actions should address the root cause of the deficiency rather than
           relief from specific symptoms. Include status updates on progress to remediation.
           2.7.2.2.10. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Review. Squadron, Group or Wing staff
           agency commanders/chiefs must review and sign each deficiency response.
       2.7.2.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Problem areas are monitored for potential trends. In
       addition, all corrective actions for deficiencies are validated in a subsequent
       exercise/inspection to ensure the corrective actions were adequate to solve the problem to
       avoid potential repeat deficiencies.
   2.7.3. (Added-AETC) IEPO Responsibilities.
       2.7.3.1. (Added-AETC) Review corrective actions and identify recurring or common
       deficiencies (trend analysis.)
       2.7.3.2. (Added-AETC) Track corrective actions and suspenses via commander’s
       Remedial Action Program for follow-up actions.
       2.7.3.3. (Added-AETC) Ensure corrective actions are appropriate and correctly address
       root causes.
       2.7.3.4. (Added-AETC) Notify the Group or Wing Commander (as applicable) of
       corrective actions that could not be resolved at a lower level.
       2.7.3.5. (Added-AETC) Maintain a corrective actions record for at least two years.
       2.7.3.6. (Added-AETC) Validate corrective actions during subsequent exercises.
2.8. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Simulations. Simulations are actions taken by the unit when
directed to demonstrate a task or tasks that due to peacetime constraints cannot be accomplished
because of prohibitive expense, expenditure of critical resources, significant safety concerns, real
world mission impact, etc. Simulations will be kept to an absolute minimum. When simulations
are unavoidable, units may propose a workaround procedure to “simulate” the non-executable
portion of the task to be performed. Exercises employ the “train the way you fight” concept
emphasizing maximum participation and minimum simulation to demonstrate actual capabilities.
Maximum realism will be consistent with safety requirements, mission accomplishment,
security, and financial constraints. Refer to AFI 10-2501 for further guidance.

  2.8.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) All simulation requests will be routed through the 81
  TRW/XPE, IEPO. Approval authority for all simulation requests is the 81 TRW/CC and 81
  TRW/XPE. Unless a simulation is approved, all actions are expected to be carried out as
  they would be in a real world scenario. (See Attachment 7 for format)
  2.8.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) The following are approved standard simulations:
     2.8.2.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) EET evaluators actively observing during an exercise
     will be simulated as “present for duty” during total force accountability exercises.
     2.8.2.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) The following contractor personnel are expected to
     participate as directed by their COR, contracting officer, and/or statement of work:
        2.8.2.2.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Contract personnel who routinely perform
        duties inside a government facility as part of their daily activities will participate in
        the exercise.
        2.8.2.2.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Contract               maintenance     personnel    and
        contractors supporting Operations Support Flight (OSF) and the flying mission will
        participate in the exercise until such status is terminated by proper wing authorities
        OR until directed by the WG/CV/SOF in order to receive returning aircraft. In no
        case will maintenance be impeded from receiving aircraft that are attempting to park.
        2.8.2.2.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Contract personnel who routinely perform
        duties outside a government facility (not including OSF contractor support) will NOT
        participate in the exercise. This includes construction contract work and grounds
        maintenance work. Construction contract work will NOT be impeded. Contract
        personnel are expected to remain responsive to direction by proper authorities in all
        cases and not pose added risk or unauthorized inputs (injects) into the exercise.
     2.8.2.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) All Air Force civilian employees are required to
     participate. However, all civilian overtime is at the discretion of the appropriate
     commander. If the commander deems overtime is not appropriate, he/she will, if at all
     possible, notify the EET at least 30 minutes prior to the end of the duty day.
     2.8.2.4. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Military family members (i.e., dependents) and other
     nonparticipating personnel (retirees) should use discretion in their activities so interaction
     with duty personnel does not detract from the exercise. Voluntary participation of on-
     base military family members is encouraged.
     2.8.2.5. (Added-KEESLERAFB) AAFES, DeCA, and 81 FSS Services facilities are
     NOT exempted from exercise activities. These facilities/functions will comply with
     procedures and should not close to avoid an exercise. Active duty military patrons in
     those facilities will respond to exercises if their mission dictates (i.e. Security Forces, Fire
     Department, Medical). Other customers may remain in the facility but if movement into
     and out of the facility is not permitted they must wait until authority is granted (i.e.
     Active Shooter). Once these facilities have demonstrated the capability to complete the
     task they may resume normal operations.
     2.8.2.6. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Any activity that requires off-base temporary duty
     attendance or expenditure of funds by other organizations is exempt from the exercise.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                             31


     2.8.2.7. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Classes conducted by civilian institutions or
     contractors in the Education Center will not be interrupted. Likewise, promotion,
     education, academic block tests, progress checks, and other types of testing where any
     delays would result in lost time that cannot be reasonable recovered will not be
     interrupted.
     2.8.2.8. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Formal training may be interrupted, if necessary, to
     achieve desired exercise objectives. Instructors and students, while engaged in formal or
     scheduled training events, are normally exempt from exercise participation, as are
     maintenance and operator personnel directly supporting the training. The IEPO Chief
     will coordinate with the 81 MSG/CC or the 81 TRG/CC prior to scheduling exercises that
     impact previously scheduled training.
     2.8.2.9. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Chapel services will not be interrupted. In addition,
     evaluators will not be present during any confidential personal counseling sessions. The
     scope, content, and quality of such counseling sessions will not be evaluated.
     2.8.2.10. (Added-KEESLERAFB) 81 MDG patient care may be interrupted only to the
     extent necessary to perform required exercise functions during exercises. 81 MDG
     personnel not directly involved with patient care will respond to exercises. Patients with
     scheduled appointments (on and off base) are normally exempt from exercise
     participation. However, after determining the urgency of the medical need, squadron
     commanders/staff agency chiefs may direct exercise participants to reschedule
     appointments.
     2.8.2.11. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Military court proceedings, Courts-Martial, Article
     32 hearings, administrative discharge boards, and other officially convened inquiries and
     direct contract negotiations (Base Contracting) proceedings will not be interrupted.
     However, after consulting the appropriate convening authority, the Wing Commander
     may elect to postpone these proceedings to maximize exercise/inspection participation.
     2.8.2.12. (Added-KEESLERAFB) 81 Communication Squadron personnel required for
     the repair of real-world communications critical to command and control systems are
     exempt from exercise participation while repairs are in progress.
     2.8.2.13. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Use simulated cash. Simulated cash may be in any
     appropriate form (i.e. play money, cards annotated by dollar amounts).
     2.8.2.14. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Simulate the movement and distribution of drugs
     and narcotics by using representative props that demonstrate correct procedures.
     2.8.2.15. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Certain facilities and their employees are exempt
     from total evacuation during an exercise (see Table 2.1.). Those exempt are restricted to
     essential persons and people having legitimate business within the facility. Personnel
     who are conducting business when an evacuation is directed may conclude their business,
     but then must follow the exercise scenario. Evacuation plans for these facilities should
     be checked, and assigned personnel should be questioned to ensure they know how to
     evacuate during an actual situation. However, these facilities may be completely
     evacuated during an exercise if prior coordination and agreements have been made. The
     facilities/areas exempt from evacuation are:

2.9. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Alert and Recall.
   2.9.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) The base giant voice is normally used during exercises. If
   the giant voice is used, the base populous, surrounding civilian community, and local civil
   authorities will be notified well in advance by the IEPO Chief in coordination with Public
   Affairs and the Command Post.
   2.9.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Do not count personnel who are on TDY or on leave in the
   local area who could have been recalled during actual contingencies as shortfalls. These
   individuals may be simulated as present and processed during deployment exercises.
   Identify all such individuals on a simulation letter.
2.10. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Deployment Exercises.
   2.10.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Once members and/or equipment is deployed or
   simulated deployed, do not use them in any other portion of the exercise. Released personnel
   are to return to their duty section to accomplish non-exercise related duties.
   2.10.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Equipment that is normally physically transferred to other
   base agencies during actual operations will be simulated during exercises,. However, all
   appropriate documentation required by normal transfer operations will be accomplished and
   provided to EET.
   2.10.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Complete TDY orders as required for simulated
   movements, but DO NOT authenticate them. Ensure orders are clearly marked “Exercise,
   Exercise, Exercise”.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                              33


  2.10.4. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Simulate the movement and distribution of drugs and
  narcotics by using representative props which demonstrate correct procedures.
  2.10.5. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Personnel substitutions, shortfalls, or back-fills should be
  as prescribed in AFI 10-403 and applicable AETC directives, unless otherwise specified in
  the deployment order.
  2.10.6. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Use the CA/CRL deployment listing to simulate transfer
  of equipment accountability (As applicable).
  2.10.7. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Simulate vehicle contracting or rental for deploying
  teams; however, units must demonstrate the capability to secure needed contract or rental
  vehicles, if required. All applicable documentation will be accomplished and provided to an
  EET evaluator.
  2.10.8. (Added-KEESLERAFB) When a team or chalk is ready to deploy, notify the
  EET/IG transportation inspector and hold the team or chalk until inspected.
  2.10.9. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Immediately after ENDEX provide the inspectors with a
  copy of the following troop commander and cargo courier packages: AF Forms 9,
  Government Bill of Lading (GBLs), Government Travel Requests (GTRs), transportation and
  other work centers logs, copies of special orders, deployment control center logs, equipment
  shortfall requests, EET/IG generated tasking messages, levy reclaim requests, load departure
  messages, personnel on leave or TDY recall requests, WRM release requests, cargo
  manifests, and other documentation generated during the exercise. All documentation will be
  completed on forms required by higher headquarters’ directives. Do not transmit exercise
  messages; mark messages “NOT FOR TRANSMISSION.”
  2.10.10. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Simulate issue of Biological/Chemical Warfare and
  Anti-Malaria antidotes when directed on preparation, movement or TDY orders by issuing
  training devices, computer labels, or simulation cards to the troop commander or each
  individual.
  2.10.11. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Simulate the transport of the original DD Form 2766,
  Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet (Deployed Medical Record) unless otherwise
  directed. Medical records will be screened and the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal
  Technology Application (AHLTA) version of the DD Form 2766 will be printed and
  packaged for transport to demonstrate the capability. The package(s) of AHLTA printed DD
  Form 2766 will be transported to the DPU.
2.11. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Communications and Reports.
  2.11.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Give required Operational Reports (voice and message)
  to the EET. Do not send these reports off-base unless directed by the IEPO Chief.
  2.11.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) During EET evaluations and higher headquarters
  inspections, all exercise message traffic will be prepared but not transmitted unless directed
  by an EET/IG team evaluator. A copy of all incoming and outgoing exercise messages
  processed during the evaluation/inspection will be maintained in a separate folder for review
  by the EET/IG team. Classified and unclassified messages will be maintained in separate
  folders and marked accordingly.
 34                              AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


   2.11.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Communication outages may be simulated by denying
   their use or deactivation of equipment.
   2.11.4. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Begin and terminate all exercise inputs, reports, and other
   communications (radio, telephone, etc.) with phrases such as “THIS IS AN EXERCISE,”
   “EXERCISE MESSAGE,” “EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE, or “EXERCISE
   TRANSMISSION.”
   2.11.5. (Added-KEESLERAFB) All exercises: Communications with off-base agencies
   must be simulated unless the agency has agreed in advance to support the exercise. Correct
   telephone numbers or alternate means of contact must be readily available regardless of their
   participation in the exercise. EET evaluators will simulate the off-base agencies as required,
   or if directed contact the White Cell at 377-4099/4050/5198.
2.12. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Accident and Disaster Sites.
      2.12.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Base agencies will assist the EET with equipment and
      material to use as scene props. Permanent party and casual student personnel (AFIs) may be
      tasked to assist with exercise site preparation/tear-down, and role-playing.
      2.12.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Exercise props and implementers should conform as
      closely as possible to the actual item they represent. Use moulage kits, actual documents,
      mockups, condemned, excess, spare and training supplies/equipment to enhance realism.
      2.12.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Status cards may be used to provide the simulated status
      of equipment or facilities involved in exercises.
      2.12.4. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Damage cards may be used to indicate the damage of
      equipment, weapons, buildings, or facilities. These cards will be prominently displayed or
      given to exercise participants.
      2.12.5. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Accomplish shelter operations as completely as possible
      consistent with the threat, while considering the cost benefit, logistical limitations, and
      simulations directed by the IEPO Chief.
2.13. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Emergency Vehicles.
      2.13.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) The Fire Chief will be given at least 30 minutes prior
      notification of an exercise if it includes the movement of fire vehicles. At this time, the Fire
      Chief is considered an exercise trusted agent and will not discuss this aspect of the exercise
      with anyone until the event is initiated. This is necessary to ensure an actual emergency does
      not exist and the exercise does not prevent the fire department from supporting other critical
      real-world mission requirements.
      2.13.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) When responding to the exercise, emergency vehicles
      will use warning lights but not sirens. Vehicle mounted sirens will only be used during a real-
      world emergency when the emergency vehicles depart the exercise accident site.
      2.13.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Vehicle operators must abide by posted speed limits and
      traffic control devices.
      2.13.4. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Do not use warning lights and sirens when responding to
      off-base exercises.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                                  35


2.14. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Casualties.
   2.14.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Casualties (sick, wounded, injured, and fatalities) will be
   simulated by personnel or mannequins wearing moulage or makeup. They will also possess
   index cards indicating vital signs and the extent of wounds or injuries.
   2.14.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Expendable medical supplies (i.e., bandages and splints)
   will be used, but nonexpendable supplies (i.e., medications and needles) will be simulated.
   Additional medical supplies needed by clinic patient treatment teams will be simulated but
   annotated as though they were actually delivered. Oxygen masks will be put in place but
   oxygen will not be turned on.
   2.14.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Transport of casualties to civilian hospitals will be
   simulated unless civil authorities are participating in the exercise. Casualties will be
   transported to the clinic and all paperwork will be accomplished. Paperwork will be
   presented to the MDG EET.
2.15. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Off-Base Support.
   2.15.1. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Request for support or coordination that would normally
   go to higher headquarters or off-base agencies will be routed to the IEPO Chief.
   2.15.2. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Walkthrough procedures will be used for the purchase of
   emergency supplies and services. Base Contracting will demonstrate to the EET the
   capability of notifying local vendors to obtain prices and availability of items. The actual
   notification of vendors will be simulated.
   2.15.3. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Requests for support from civilian hospitals will normally
   be simulated by addressing the calls to the White Cell. Calls will be recorded on AF Form
   1924, Events Log.
2.16. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Identification of EET Members. The EET members will
have individually numbered EET badges assigned and tracked by the IEPO Chief.
2.17. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Safety and Security Violations. If a potential/actual safety or
security violation is observed, EET evaluators or exercise participants must take immediate
action to prevent injury, release of classified information, or damage to equipment. EET
evaluators may stop the exercise scenario through a "knock it off" statement when either safety
or security infractions are first identified or reported. If an actual accident or injury does occur
during an exercise, any EET evaluator (or inspector) will delay the exercise and give necessary
aid. Begin related radio or telephone transmissions with “THIS IS A REAL-WORLD
EMERGENCY.” If an actual emergency develops while an exercise is in progress, the IEPO
Chief (Incident Commander or the Wing Commander) will suspend or terminate the exercise as
necessary.
2.18. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Exercise PAUSEX. The IEPO Chief, EET members, in-
coordination with the Incident Commander, or Wing Commander can pause the exercise using
the phrase “EXERCISE PAUSEX” until the real world emergency is resolved. While in
PAUSEX all exercise scenarios will stop and all exercise radio transmission will cease until the
exercise is resumed. This keeps radio frequency free for emergency responders to respond to the
real-world emergency. It also keeps exercise participants from artificially getting ahead of the
 36                           AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


exercise scenarios when the exercise resumes. The IEPO Chief will coordinate with the Incident
Commander, or the Wing Commander to resume the exercise.
2.19. (Added-KEESLERAFB) Security. Security is an integral part of exercise planning. All
aspects of EET exercises should be held in strict confidence. Release of certain information is
required with some base offices (i.e., medical, security police, etc.) and may be released with the
understanding that exercise information compromise may cause “false starts” and prevent true
evaluation of an installations response capability. It is up to the IEPO Chief to terminate an
exercise if a significant compromise occurs.

                                         Chapter 3

                     EXERCISE FUNDING AND PROGRAMMING

3.1. General Information.
   3.1.1. The Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2) account funds Air Force
   participation in Joint Exercise Program (JEP) exercises. The CE2 account is programmed by
   the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness (OUSD (P&R)) and
   is managed by the Joint Staff (JS)/J-7 with support from US Joint Forces Command
   (USJFCOM).
   3.1.2. Exercise funding and programming actions occur within the DoD biennial Planning,
   Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.
   3.1.3. Air Force organizations will comply with the JEP provisions in CJCSI 3511.01A,
   Joint Exercise Transportation Program.
3.2. Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2) Account.
   3.2.1. The CE2 account provides funds for the following types of exercise activities:
      3.2.1.1. Incremental Expenses. CE2 provides Service Incremental Funding (SIF) to pay
      for the incremental O&M activities incurred solely for, or as a direct result of, planning
      for or taking part in a CE2-funded exercise. Valid incremental activities include such
      items as lodging, per diem, non-aviation fuel, consumable supplies, contract support, and
      communications. It does not include costs funded in other AF accounts, such as flying
      hours.
      3.2.1.2. Transportation. Exercise transportation includes airlift, sealift, Port Handling
      (PH), Inland Transportation (IT), and the Commercial Ticket Program (CTP).
      Transportation funding generally covers the cost of transporting personnel and equipment
      from a unit’s home station to the exercise area and return. Commercial air travel from
      home station to and from the aerial port of embarkation (APOE), however, is a Service
      responsibility. Active duty, ANG, and AFRC forces can receive CE2 Transportation
      funds.
          3.2.1.2.1. Port Handling (PH). Port handling includes commercial contract expenses
          to receive or dispatch cargo for an exercise at Port of Embarkation (POE) and Port of
          Debarkation (POD) associated with Military Sealift Command (MSC) for sealift and
          Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) for commercial shipping.
          PH expenses include documentation, terminal handling, and stevedoring.
          3.2.1.2.2. Inland Transportation (IT). Inland transportation funds purchase approved
          point-to-point transportation service associated with the movement of exercise
          participants and cargo, between the units’ home base/installation to and from a
          POE/POD and to or from the exercise area, by commercial-for-hire firms when
          organic transportation is not available or cost effective. Movement is by surface
          transportation (rail, highway, and inland waterway).          Using vehicles where
          commercial drivers are included in the lease/ticket price is permissible. The leasing
          of commercial vehicles (e.g., passenger vans), however, is specifically excluded and
 38                         AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


         should not be confused with commercial-for-hire firms, including bus lines.
         Transportation expenses associated with temporary duty, exercise conferences, and
         air travel are specifically excluded from IT funding.
         3.2.1.2.3. Commercial Ticket Program (CTP). This program supports individual
         commercial air travel during exercise execution when military airlift or commercial
         air charter cannot satisfy the sponsoring command’s transportation requirements.
         CTP is used only when United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)-
         provided common-user transportation cannot satisfy the CCDR-validated exercise
         Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). CTP funds can only be used to
         purchase commercial airline tickets. CTP funds do not cover per diem or movement
         to the APOE or from the APOD. Once CTP requirements are determined for a
         particular exercise, USTRANSCOM will post the CTP authorization message on their
         Single Mobility System (SMS) website.
   3.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT is responsible for managing the disbursement of CE2 funds associated
   with Air Force participation in JEP exercises.
      3.2.2.1. Funding for JEP exercises is based on requirements identified in the Joint
      Training Information Management System (JTIMS). Exercise sponsors, planners, and
      participants should ensure the accurate and timely entry of required JTIMS data.
      3.2.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT will use Emergency and Special Project (ESP) codes to track CE2
      expenditures by exercise. To facilitate exercise expenditure accounting, Air Force
      organizations will ensure that all exercise fund cites contain the proper ESP code.
3.3. CE2 Funds Management.
   3.3.1. PH/IT Funds.
      3.3.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of PH/IT
      funds.
      3.3.1.2. Transportation Account Codes (TAC). MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should use
      TACs to fund PH/IT requirements whenever possible. When a TAC is not viable,
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will request PH/IT funding per paragraph 3.3.1.3.
      3.3.1.3. Funding Request. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU exercise planners will send a PH/IT
      funding request to AF/A3O-ATT (afa3oatt.workflow@pentagon.af.mil) as soon as the
      PH/IT need is known. The PH/IT funding request will include the exercise name,
      number of passengers and/or total weight of cargo (in short tons), and the estimated cost.
         3.3.1.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will forward the PH/IT request to JS/J7 (JEXD). The JS
         Comptroller will post the funds on the Program Budget Accounting System (PBAS)
         for the respective MAJCOM/FOA/DRU.             MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs are then
         responsible for getting funds to the appropriate units and for tracking PH/IT
         obligations by exercise name and ESP code.
   3.3.2. CTP Funds.
   3.3.2. (AETC) CTP Funds.
      3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of CTP

          current JS/J7 Joint Exercise Transportation Program, Commercial Ticket Program
          Implementation Guidance.
          3.3.2.1.1. (AETC) HQ AETC/A3OX is responsible for managing and requesting
          Commercial Ticket Program (CTP) funds for participation in JEP exercises.
   3.3.3. SIF Funds.
       3.3.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will oversee the distribution of                 SIF   funds    and
       MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation of SIF funds.
       3.3.3.2. Funding Request.    MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will follow SIF procedures in
       paragraph 3.5.
   3.3.4. CE2 funds are authorized to support specific approved exercise expenses and may not
   be redirected to fund any other activities. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs must track PH/IT, CTP,
   and SIF obligations separately.
3.4. Exercise Funds Responsibilities.
   3.4.1. JEP Exercises.
       3.4.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT is the AF OPR for managing CE2-supplied SIF.
       3.4.1.2. JS/J-7 (JEXD) is the OPR for managing CE2-supplied PH, IT, and CTP funds.
       AF/A3O-ATT will coordinate consolidated AF requests for these funds to JS by exercise.
       3.4.1.3. All AF organizations will comply with JCS exercise funding guidance in AFI
       65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Table 10.3.
   3.4.2. Non-JEP Exercises. Air Force organizations conducting unilateral or other joint
   exercises not within the approved JEP must fund these exercises from their own O&M
   accounts. For Air Force-sponsored non-JEP exercises, the MAJCOM or Air Force
   organization sponsoring an exercise is generally responsible for funding the exercise.
   3.4.3. Combined Exercises. Combined exercises should have a written arrangement with
   the foreign participant(s) that includes the authority for the exercise, the scope of the
   exercise, status of US personnel (paragraph 1.3.4.6), and funding procedures, as
   appropriate. Any US training provided to participating countries should be handled under
   available legal authority, such as by a foreign military sales (FMS) case or cross-servicing
   agreement under Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authority.
3.5. HAF Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process for Service
Incremental Funding (SIF).
   3.5.1. During the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development process,
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit their Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) SIF
   requirements for JEP exercises to AF/A3O-ATT.
       3.5.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT will consolidate Air Force requirements and submit the Air Force
       SIF request to OUSD(P&R).
 40                              AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


         3.5.1.2. OUSD(P&R) incorporates AF SIF requirements into the overall Defense-wide
         CE2 request as part of the President’s Budget (PB).
      3.5.2. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act establishes the amount of CE2 funds
      appropriated for the upcoming execution year. Congress must approve and the President
      must sign this act for funds to be available. If the appropriations act is not signed before the
      beginning of the execution year, funding is generally available under a continuing resolution.
      3.5.3. OUSD(P&R) will determine AF SIF funding for the current execution year and
      publish this information as part of the CE2 Program Execution Plan (PEP). Once the AF SIF
      allocation is known, AF/A3O-ATT will provide execution year fiscal guidance to AF
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs.
         3.5.3.1. If a MAJCOM/FOA/DRU encounters an unanticipated SIF requirement during
         the current fiscal year, the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU should notify AF/A3O-ATT of the
         requirement. The notification should include sufficient explanation to justify a request
         for additional funds. If AF/A3O-ATT cannot fund the requirement from existing AF SIF
         resources, when deemed appropriate, they will submit an Unfunded Requirement to the
         Joint Staff for additional funds from the CE2 Program.
         3.5.3.2. AF SIF must only be obligated to fund valid JEP exercise activities.
         MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should notify AF/A3O-ATT when they have excess SIF funds.
         Ultimately, SIF funds not needed to support AF exercise participation requirements revert
         back to OUSD(P&R) control for reallocation against other CE2 program requirements.
3.6. Tracking and Reporting.
      3.6.1. PH/IT and CTP funds are distributed per the procedures in paragraphs 3.3.1 and
      3.3.2 respectively. SIF funds are distributed per AF/A3O-ATT-issued fiscal guidance.
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will track transportation funds (Z5 funds) sub-allocated from the
      Joint Staff.
         3.6.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should track all JEP expenditures using assigned ESP
         codes. Questions concerning the use of ESP codes should be addressed to AF/A3O-ATT.
      3.6.2. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit monthly SIF obligation reports to AF/A3O-ATT
      by the third working day of the following month.
         3.6.2.1. AF/A3O-ATT will submit a consolidated SIF obligation report to OUSD(P&R)
         within the first week of the month following the report month.
      3.6.3. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit monthly obligation reports (Flash Reports) for
      funds sub-allocated from the Joint Staff. Flash Reports will be submitted to the Joint Staff
      Comptroller with info to AF/A3O-ATT by the third working day of the following month.
3.7. Funding for Aerial Refueling of Foreign Aircraft during Combined Exercises.
      3.7.1. USAF tankers flying aerial refueling missions to exclusively support US aircraft
      during combined exercises can also refuel foreign aircraft on the same mission provided the
      following conditions are met:
         3.7.1.1. Refueling of foreign aircraft is conducted on a strictly opportune, non-
         interference basis.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                                41


     3.7.1.2. Exercise tanker missions are scheduled based on supporting US exercise mission
     requirements only.
     3.7.1.3. Tanker loiter time is not added to exercise tanker missions simply to
     accommodate non-exercise refueling operations.
     3.7.1.4. Foreign governments must pay for the fuel offloaded in accordance with USAF
     instructions and procedures (for example, pursuant to the terms of a reciprocal fuels
     agreement, cross-servicing agreement, or FMS case).
  3.7.2. If the foreign aircraft refueling operation does not increase the required flying time of
  the planned exercise-only refueling mission, the foreign government must only pay for the
  offloaded fuel.
     3.7.2.1. If the foreign aircraft refueling takes place outside the “envelope” for meeting
     USAF mission requirements and time is added to the planned exercise refueling mission
     to support foreign aircraft refueling operations, the foreign government must also pay for
     the additional flying hours along with the offloaded fuel.
  3.7.3. When a combined exercise utilizes USAF tankers to refuel foreign aircraft as part of
  the exercise, the refueling of foreign aircraft can be conducted on a less than full cost
  reimbursement basis provided that:
     3.7.3.1. The purpose of the combined exercise is to employ coalition force concepts of
     operations that require USAF aerial refueling of foreign aircraft in support of DoD
     mission requirements;
     3.7.3.2. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise approves of conducting the
     refueling on a less than full cost reimbursement basis;
     3.7.3.3. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise notifies AF/A3O-AT and
     AMC/FMF with a command coordinated memorandum specifying the aerial refueling
     operations that will be conducted on a less than full cost reimbursement basis. The
     memorandum should be submitted NLT 30 days prior to the exercise and include:
         3.7.3.3.1. A description of the operation, including objectives;
         3.7.3.3.2. The US mission requirements to be satisfied;
         3.7.3.3.3. A list of expenses to be assumed by the DoD and the funding source;
         3.7.3.3.4. A list of expenses to be assumed by the foreign government, including
         method of payment to DoD for required reimbursements.
  3.7.4. If the foreign aircraft aerial refueling does not meet the criteria set forth in
  paragraphs 3.7.1 or 3.7.3., aerial refueling must be conducted on a full reimbursement basis.
  The foreign government must pay for all applicable costs, such as offloaded fuel,
  boom/drogue time, tanker transit time, and loiter time.
  3.7.5. Foreign Aerial Refueling Requirements.
     3.7.5.1. Foreign receiver pilots and commercial and foreign tanker crews participating in
     aerial refueling operations during exercise missions involving USAF tankers or receivers
     must be qualified in and use USAF aerial refueling terminology and procedures as
     specified in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allied Tactical Publication
 42                          AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


      (ATP)-56(B),            Air             to                    Air              Refuelling
      (http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/airtoair56b.cfm).
          3.7.5.1.1. Per ATP-56(B), qualified foreign pilots and commercial and foreign boom
          operators must meet aerial refueling currency requirements or adhere to published re-
          currency procedures.
          3.7.5.1.2. Exercise aerial refueling missions will not be used to qualify or requalify
          foreign receiver pilots, or commercial or foreign boom operators as this is the
          provision of a defense service to the foreign country that requires a FMS case or
          cross-servicing agreement under ACSA authority, as appropriate (see DoDD
          5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Chapter 10.5).
      3.7.5.2. Tanker and receiver aircraft operated commercially or by foreign nations must
      be certified as technically compatible for aerial refueling operations with USAF receiver
      and tanker aircraft. Information about foreign receiver aircraft that are technically
      compatible with USAF tankers, commercial and foreign tankers that are technically
      compatible with USAF receivers, and instructions for requesting a technical compatibility
      assessment are published in ATP-56(B), Annex Z, US National Annex.
3.8. (Added-AETC) Exercise Munitions Account.
   3.8.1. (Added-AETC) The IEPO should be familiar with the process to forecast practice
   munitions according to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management.
   Note: AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions, outlines munitions available for EET
   use.
   3.8.2. (Added-AETC) IEPO will work with installation munitions accountability systems
   officers (MASO) to obtain Ammunition/Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMMO/AMST)
   account and to schedule practice ground munitions training for select EET members. The
   MASO reports the installation munitions request and allocation in the Global Ammunition
   Control Point and establish procedures.
   3.8.3. (Added-AETC) If the IEPO does not have a munitions account, and munitions are
   used for exercises, a memorandum documenting how exercise munitions are used and
   maintained for exercises must be kept by the IEPO.
   3.8.4. (Added-AETC) Effective exercise planning is essential to alleviating costly
   munitions expenditures; purchasing bird cannons, smoke machines, etc., is a suitable
   substitute for munitions and provides environmentally safe realisms to any exercise.
   3.8.5. (Added-AETC) EET members designated to employ smoke generating devices or
   ground burst simulators must be trained and qualified on the use of the devices as well as
   required protective equipment IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
   3.8.6. (Added-AETC) If explosives are used during an exercise, the EET Chief will prepare
   an inventory of devices to be used and accomplish a risk assessment, in coordination with
   Wing Safety prior to use. The installation commander must approve the use of training
   munitions IAW AFMAN 91-201.

            AIR FORCE JOINT EXERCISE COORDINATION TEAM (AFJECT)

A2.1. Overview. This attachment outlines the organization, responsibilities and procedures for
the AFJECT and describes the process for developing the Global Exercise Schedule (GES).
ACC/A3J Division Chief is the AFJECT Chairperson and delegated authority to coordinate
USAF support for joint and USAF service-level training events to include Flag exercises, Joint
National Training Center (JNTC) events and functional command events.
A2.2. Objective. The objective of the AFJECT is to coordinate, schedule, and deconflict, as
required, the Air Force Air & Space Operations Center (AOC), Control and Reporting Center
(CRC), Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW),
assets assigned by the EIPT and any other MAJCOM units/assets used to support USAF,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), COCOM-sponsored and other MAJCOM
exercises and experiments. The AFJECT uses the GES to accomplish this task.
A2.3. Organization.
      A2.3.1. The AFJECT is an action officer (AO) level working group made up of exercise
      planners, schedulers and support staff from the member organizations listed in Para 3.3. and
      chaired by the ACC/A3J Division Chief. The Chairman is the spokesperson for the AFJECT
      and approves all team decisions.
      A2.3.2. The AFJECT will submit a coordinated and validated GES to the Exercise
      Integrated Process Team (EIPT) and Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG), in
      turn, for approval. This approval chain will also be used to address unresolved exercise
      support issues that occur during the GES development process. If required, MAJCOM
      representatives can also engage the EIPT or EGOSG to reclama exercise scheduling conflicts
      or other AFJECT decisions. In all cases, issues will be resolved at the lowest appropriate
      level.
      A2.3.3. Membership. As a minimum, the following organizations will have representatives
      on the AFJECT:
         A2.3.3.1. ACC
         A2.3.3.2. PACAF (AFPAC)
         A2.3.3.3. USAFE (AFEUR)
         A2.3.3.4. AFSPC
         A2.3.3.5. AFMC
         A2.3.3.6. AETC
         A2.3.3.7. AMC
         A2.3.3.8. AFSOC
         A2.3.3.9. AFGSC
         A2.3.3.10. ANG
         A2.3.3.11. AFRC
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013                                                 51


      A2.3.3.12. 1AF (AFNORTH)
      A2.3.3.13. 8AF (AFSTRAT)
      A2.3.3.14. 9AF (AFCENT)
      A2.3.3.15. 12AF (AFSOUTH)
      A2.3.3.16. 14AF (AFSTRAT-SP)
      A2.3.3.17. 17 AF (AFAFRICA)
      A2.3.3.18. 24AF (AFCYBER)
      A2.3.3.19. GCIC
      A2.3.3.20. AFAMS
      A2.3.3.21. 505 CCW
      A2.3.3.22. Representatives from other organizations may attend and participate with
      prior approval from the AFJECT Chairperson.
A2.4. AFJECT Process:
   A2.4.1. AFJECT Conferences. The AFJECT will hold up to two conferences per year.
   The first conference, normally held in the Spring, will prioritize and deconflict, as required,
   the next year’s exercise and experiment schedules. It is normally scheduled NLT 90 days
   after the Spring Joint Staff (JS) Worldwide Joint Training and Scheduling Conference
   (WJTSC). The second conference, normally held in the Fall, will address the exercise
   schedule for the ensuing 18-24 months, provide exercise related updates and address any
   emerging issues. This second conference will typically use video teleconference (VTC)
   capabilities to minimize travel requirements and encourage maximum participation.
   A2.4.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES) Preparation.
      A2.4.2.1. The GES is developed in one-year increments. The AFJECT program
      manager will develop five years of exercise schedules and maintain them on the AFJECT
      Community of Practice (CoP) website.
      A2.4.2.2. MAJCOM program and functional managers will identify/establish their
      command exercise requirements and submit them to the AFJECT program manager NLT
      2 months prior to each biannual AFJECT conference for posting onto the CoP. Exercise
      planners will work with the AFJECT program manager to determine resource availability
      and coordinate specific support requirements.
      A2.4.2.3. Six weeks prior to each conference, AFJECT members will review the GES
      and identify the exercises their units are participating in and annotate the exercise support
      resources they are requesting for their events (i.e. exercise control group, AOC manning
      augmentation, etc.). Any changes to GES information must be submitted to the program
      manager NLT two weeks before the conference.
      A2.4.2.4. In preparation for the AFJECT conference, the AFJECT program manager will
      post all scheduling changes, build a draft schedule and develop the AFJECT briefing.
      Functional program managers will review the updated schedule to determine unit
      supportability. MAJCOM planners/schedulers should attempt to resolve exercise
 52                            AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


         scheduling issues prior to the conference. Unresolved issues will be addressed during the
         conference.
            A2.4.2.4.1. Voluntary support to non-AFJECT scheduled events does not relieve a
            unit of the responsibility to support AFJECT scheduled requirements. Also, while the
            AFJECT does not schedule AFRC/ANG forces, AFRC and ANG units should utilize
            the GES to identify training and support opportunities.
         A2.4.2.5. Following the AFJECT conference, the program manager will draft the
         meeting minutes, update the GES, as required, and forward it to the EIPT and EGOSG, in
         turn, for approval. Once the GES is approved, the program manager will prepare the 505
         CCW tasking message for ACC/CV release.

MEMORANDUM FOR

FROM: 123 FW/XPI
      444 Anywhere Road, Suite 10
      Coastal AFB

SUBJECT: SILVER STAR 11-03, Natural Disaster Response Exercise/Pyramid Alert Recall
         Exercise

1. SUMMARY:

   a. Overall Rating: (If used).

   b. Exercise Date(s): 11-12 Mar 2011

   c. Type of Exercises: SILVER STAR 11-03 focused on a Natural Disaster Response
   Exercise (NDRE). It provided training and a realistic review of wing plans and checklists for
   the 2011 hurricane season. Additionally, the wing fulfilled the annual requirement of testing
   its Pyramid Alert Recall procedures.

   d. Exercise Objectives: The purpose of the exercise was to assess the wing’s capability to
   respond to emergency situations encountered during Hurricane Condition (HURCON) phases
   and to assess the response to emergency situations of such magnitude as to warrant a
   response by the base disaster response force. This exercise was also used to validate unit
   “closed” deficiencies from previous exercises. Specific functional exercise objectives are
   listed in Attachment 1 below and were evaluated by the Exercise Evaluation Team (EET).

2. Exercise Summaries:

   a. Hurricane: (Rating) Overall, the exercise provided worthwhile training for personnel in
   preparation for the hurricane season. It challenged the wing’s leadership at all phases of
   HURCON, from initial preparations to evacuation of jets and personnel, through recovery.
   “Hurricane Jackie” was the perfect storm in its predictability. The base leadership made all
   the right decisions, resulting in aircraft and personnel being evacuated in plenty of time to
   move to a safe haven. The base ride-out element met for a tabletop, providing excellent
   training for all team members. The Communications Squadron did an outstanding job
   moving all equipment required by CEMP 10-2.

      (1) Several lessons were learned from this exercise. The 123 TRG Shelter Management
      Team (SMT) developed an exceptional internal checklist that ensured shelter stocking,
      personnel in-processing and outlined daily SMT procedures that should be incorporated
 58                            AFI10-204_AETCSUP_KEESLERAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2013


       as an installation standard for all SMTs. To save valuable preparation time, the
       Hurricane Watch Team (HWT) will now have their meetings in the Command Post (CP);
       the location move was decided in the Commanders’ “Hot Wash”. This location will
       speed the flow of critical information, and reduce the time needed to complete HURCON
       checklists. Recommend, as a standard, the HWT meet 20 minutes prior to weather
       advisories being issued. The HWT could then recommend a CSS recall if warranted and
       be in place for questions. The CSS could then immediately issue directives. All
       directives need to be disseminated promptly and control centers need to pass to their units
       without delay.

       (2) The exercise also identified inconsistencies between the checklists and the different
       wing plans used. Some ride-out members did not bring checklists to the tabletop. Also,
       during the tabletop items were identified that need to be included into plans. Several new
       members of the ride-out team had not received training; members need to be identified
       with sufficient time to allow training. Recommend Building 909 complete a facility plan
       to ensure capability of housing all equipment required in current plans. Shelter stocking
       must be incorporated into next review of CEMP 10-2. Recommend Civil Engineer
       conduct a study to determine shelter possibilities of base buildings and also which
       buildings require generators due to storm damage.

   b. Pyramid Alert Recall (Ungraded): A test of the wing telephonic recall procedures began at
   0500L on Monday. Some confusion of the actual report times lessened the effectiveness of
   the recall. Recommend quarterly recall exercises until base populace and Group Control
   Centers (GCCs)/Unit Control Centers (UCCs) become familiar with procedures.

3. Lessons Learned (Strengths, Deficiencies, Recommended Improvement Areas (RIA)):

a. See Attachment 2.

b. All Deficiencies require a written response by the OPR listed (i.e. OPR: 123 FW/XPE). It is
the OPR’s responsibility to initiate corrective action as required. RIAs do not require a written
response. RIAs, both good and bad, contain information that can make effective procedures
even better.

c. Each organization identified as an OPR with a DEFICIENCY will report the corrective
action(s) to 123 FW/XPI (see Attachment 3 for sample letter). Suspense for reply is ______.
The following agencies have replies due:
