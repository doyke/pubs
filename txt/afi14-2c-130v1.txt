 6                                                            AFI14-2C-130V1 28 January 2013


        1.1.6.2. Complete training and currency requirements within the guidelines of this
        instruction. (T-2)
        1.1.6.3. Participate only in operational activities for which they are qualified and current,
        unless under the direct supervision of qualified and current intelligence personnel. (T-2)
1.2. Qualification Training. Qualification training programs are designed to progress
intelligence personnel from IQT to Mission Qualification Training (MQT) in order to achieve
BMC or CMR status, which will be maintained via continuation training (CT) and validated by
periodic intelligence evaluations.
     1.2.1. IQT provides the initial training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel for basic
     duties in an intelligence position without regard to a unit’s mission. Upon completion of
     IQT, intelligence personnel attain Basic Qualification (BQ) status. BQ is not a long-term
     qualification status. IQT is discussed further in Chapter 2.
     1.2.2. MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or re-qualify intelligence personnel in
     a specific duty position to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Completion of
     MQT is a prerequisite for BMC or CMR status. MQT is discussed further in Chapter 3.
     1.2.3. CT provides the volume, frequency and mix of training necessary for intelligence
     personnel to maintain proficiency, currency and qualification. The Ready Intelligence
     Program (RIP) outlines the minimum CT requirements. RIP is designed to focus training on
     capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. CT is separate from skill
     level upgrade training, although CT may fulfill some skill level upgrade training
     requirements. CT and RIP are discussed further in Chapter 4.
     1.2.4. Specialized Training is training in any skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned
     missions that are not required for every intelligence unit member. Specialized Training is
     accomplished after the member has attained BMC or CMR status, and is in addition to CMR
     or BMC requirements. Specialized Training is discussed further in Chapter 5.
1.3. Position Qualification. The Chief of Wing Intelligence will designate which positions are
CMR or BMC. BMC is ideal for personnel who will be performing mission essential tasks in
wartime, but whose status or daily duties do not revolve around these tasks. Personnel that may
be ideal for BMC status include traditional Guardsmen or reservists, superintendents or
executive officers who won't be performing mission duties daily.
     1.3.1. CMR. The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily completed MQT
     and maintain qualification and currency in the mission qualification tasks and knowledge.
        1.3.1.1. CMR personnel must maintain currencies by accomplishing all designated tasks
        within the prescribed timelines. See Table 4.1 for RIP currency requirements and Table
        5.1 for Specialized Training currency requirements. (T-2)
        1.3.1.2. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in non-
        current status. While non-current, personnel may perform tasks in which they are current
        and qualified. If intelligence personnel lose currency in a particular task, that task may
        not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency IAW 14-202, Volume 1.
        (T-2)
        1.3.1.3. Personnel should meet CMR currency requirements before deploying in support
        of unit operations. However, in the case of short-notice deployments where this is not
AFI14-2C-130V1 28 January 2013                                                                   7


      possible, the Chief of Wing Intel can allow BMC personnel to deploy. If the Chief of
      Wing Intel is forced to deploy an individual who hasn't met CMR currency requirements,
      they will ensure the member's deployed chain-of-command is aware of the member's
      currency status. (T-2)
   1.3.2. BMC. The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily completed MQT,
   are qualified in the unit mission, but do not maintain CMR status. BMC personnel must be
   able to attain CMR currency within 30 days.
      1.3.2.1. BMC personnel must maintain currencies by accomplishing all designated tasks
      within the prescribed timelines. See Table 4.1 for RIP currency requirements and Table
      5.1 for Specialized Training currency requirements. (T-2)
      1.3.2.2. Failure to complete BMC required training may result in regression to non-
      current status. While non-current, personnel may perform only individual tasks in which
      they are current and qualified. If intelligence personnel lose currency in a particular task,
      that task may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency IAW 14-
      202, Volume 1. (T-2)
   1.3.3. Non-CMR/Non-BMC (N-CMR/N-BMC). Intelligence personnel who regress to N-
   CMR or N-BMC status will accomplish the requirements IAW Chapter 4 before being re-
   awarded CMR or BMC status. (T-2)
1.4. Documentation. Units will document qualification training on the AF Form 4381,
Intelligence Gradesheet, and in coordination with AF/A2 approved processes regarding online
documentation. (T-2)

                                             Chapter 2

                           INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines IQT for C-130 unit intelligence personnel. IQT for
intelligence personnel begins after initial skills training is completed (i.e. the Air Force Specialty
Code-awarding courses) and will consist of the MAF IFTU. At the completion of IQT, the
individual is qualified as BQ.
2.2. IFTU Attendance. In-residence MAF IFTU attendance is mandatory for all intelligence
personnel at their first mobility assignment. Personnel who have attended MAF IFTU in a
previous mobility assignment will repeat MAF IFTU if the break between mobility assignments
is more than four years. When possible, IFTU attendance should occur prior to reporting to the
duty station or as soon as possible after arrival at the duty station. Individuals only need to
attend the MAF IFTU once during consecutive mobility assignments. (T-1)
2.3. IFTU Timeline Waiver. When IFTU training is not available within a reasonable time
period (within 60-120 days for active duty, 90-180 days for the ARC), the unit may request a
MAF IFTU Timeline Waiver. The waiver request (see Attachment 5) must include the reason
the Chief of Wing Intel could not obtain a seat, the actions being taken to obtain the seat, and
when the individual is projected to attend. When a seat in the IFTU is not readily available, the
unit may begin MQT prior to IFTU attendance. AMC/A2 is approval authority for MAF IFTU
waivers. All MAJCOMs will route waiver requests with their endorsements to the AMC/A2
Force Management Division. (T-2)
2.4. IFTU Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the MAF IFTU formal course
syllabus and the Education and Training Course Announcements, https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
2.5. IFTU Course Development and Maintenance. The MAF IFTU will develop and
maintain its courseware and materials IAW the ISD process. The course content will be
formalized and published in the course syllabus, course training standard and course resource
estimate. These documents will be available for MAJCOM and unit review. (T-2)
2.6. IQT Documentation. BQ is attained at the completion of IQT and evaluated and

                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT is training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel in an assigned
position to perform the unit mission. Guidance in this chapter is provided to assist Chiefs of
Wing Intel in executing the MAJCOM/A2 approved minimum MQT requirements for all
individuals. Units may further tailor their programs for intelligence personnel with current
qualifications, prior experience, currency, documented performance or formal training.
Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a re-qualification program for personnel who
have regressed from CMR or BMC to specifically address deficiencies, which caused regression.
   3.1.1. Concurrent IQT/MQT. MQT should typically begin upon completion of IQT;
   however, in situations determined by the Chief of Wing Intelligence, intelligence personnel
   may begin MQT before completion of IQT, if training events and timelines make this option
   more practical. Member must complete IQT and attain BQ status before fully completing
   MQT and being awarded BMC/CMR. MQT will be completed within the time specified
   below.
   3.1.2. Timing starts within 45 days (90 days for ARC) of the individual’s first duty day at
   the gaining unit or immediately after the completion of IQT. If personnel elect to take leave
   prior to being entered into MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the leave. For
   first term airmen being entered into MQT, the timing will begin upon completion of the First
   Term Airman Course (or equivalent) at their gaining unit. Training will be completed in line
   with the following: (T-2)
       3.1.2.1. For AFRC, notify the AFRC/A2, NAF/A2 and AMC/A2 if training exceeds 120
       days with seasoning or 180 calendar days. For individual mobilization augmentees
       (IMA), notify MAJCOM Intelligence IMA Program Manager, AFRC/A2 and AMC/A2 if
       training exceeds 180 calendar days.
       3.1.2.2. For ANG, notify the National Guard Bureau A2 and AMC/A2 if training
       exceeds 180 calendar days.
       3.1.2.3. For active duty, notify MAJCOM and AMC A2 if training exceeds 120 calendar
       days.
       3.1.2.4. MAJCOM/A2s will consolidate reporting as directed and notify AMC/A2 when
       training of personnel exceeds allowable time. AMC/A2 will dictate reporting format and
       frequency.
   3.1.3. Personnel in MQT may participate in exercises if supervised while performing
   intelligence functions. The level of supervision is at the Chief of Wing Intelligence’s
   discretion.
   3.1.4. Assigned IMAs will be trained and equipped to established command standards for
   the positions they will assume. (T-2)
   3.1.5. Personnel may complete other local area orientation and training during MQT.
3.2. Mission Qualification Training Evaluation. Training is complete and personnel are
qualified CMR upon successful completion of required tasks to include completed gradesheets

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter outlines intelligence CT requirements for CMR and BMC
intelligence personnel. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of internal intelligence
training in basic intelligence task and knowledge items. These training topics ensure
familiarization with local unit intelligence functions, C-130 capabilities and threat system
capabilities. The second aspect of CT consists of specific mission-related training required to
accomplish the unit’s assigned missions. RIP is designed to focus training on capabilities needed
to accomplish the unit’s tasked missions.
4.2. Internal Intelligence Training Program. The internal intelligence training program is
intended to facilitate maintaining designated qualification and currency status of all intelligence
personnel. While the Chief of Wing Intelligence is ultimately accountable for the successful
completion of all required training, individual training is the responsibility of the trainee and
supervisor. This guidance is intended to provide a basic starting point and may be modified by
the Chief of Wing Intelligence based on unit requirements. Training for these events will consist
of unit-developed academics and scenarios.
   4.2.1. The Chief of Wing Intelligence will appoint an Intelligence Personnel Training
   Program Manager to oversee program execution. (T-3)
   4.2.2. Internal intelligence training that is not part of qualification training may be
   conducted, led or trained by personnel who are not qualification trainers.
   4.2.3. The intelligence personnel training program manager will develop an internal
   intelligence training plan that will include all training items for each intelligence duty
   position in the unit. (T-2)
   4.2.4. Internal intelligence training examinations will be compiled from the lead MAJCOM
   developed MQF, as a minimum. The Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager
   should augment the MQF with specific questions relevant to the unit’s mission. (T-2)
   4.2.5. Internal Intelligence Training Requirements. The internal intelligence training
   program should continue to emphasize the MQT tasks to facilitate RIP requirements.
   Therefore the internal intelligence training program will cover at a minimum: (T-2)

4.3. Ready Intelligence Program. The intent of RIP is to ensure intelligence personnel
perform specific mission essential tasks with sufficient frequency to maintain proficiency in their
duty positions. In order to maximize training opportunities and minimize artificiality, RIP tasks
should be conducted in conjunction with day-to-day flying training missions (e.g. Red Flag
missions, local live fly exercises, etc.) as much as possible.
   4.3.1. The standard task requirements listed in Table 4.1 establish the minimum frequency
   requirements for CMR and BMC personnel. (T-2)

   4.3.2. Individuals are responsible for documenting RIP task completion. Intelligence
   personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks and successfully accomplish periodic MSNs
   in accordance with AFI 14-202, Volume 2, and AFI 14-2C-130, Volume 2, to maintain
   currency and qualification.
   4.3.3. If an intelligence specialist loses currency in a particular area, the individual may not
   perform that task unsupervised until currency is regained. Failure to accomplish these
   requirements will affect the individual’s CMR or BMC status and additional training will be
   required as determined by the Chief of Wing Intelligence.
4.4. Regression. If intelligence personnel do not meet currency requirements throughout the
training cycle, the Chief of Wing Intelligence may direct the specialist be regressed to N-
CMR/N-BMC. Regression and the steps taken to correct the situation will be documented in a
memorandum for record in the individual’s qualification training and evaluation record. (T-2)
   4.4.1. CMR/BMC intelligence specialists regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for failing to remain
   current must complete a Chief of Wing Intel-approved recertification program to return them
   to CMR/BMC standards. The tasks accomplished during the recertification program may be
   credited toward task requirements for the training cycle. (T-2)
   4.4.2. Individuals must re-attain/attain CMR currency prior to deployment. (T-2)
4.5. Re-qualification. Intelligence personnel are unqualified upon expiration of their
qualification evaluation. This includes specialized qualifications. For all intelligence personnel
re-qualification requirements are as follows: (T-2)
   4.5.1. Unqualified up to 2 Years. Complete training in all delinquent items, additional
   training as directed by the Chief of Wing Intel and be task evaluated via a MSN evaluation.
   4.5.2. Unqualified over 2 Years. Re-accomplish MQT and the INIT MSN.

                                  SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. ST Programs. This chapter outlines ST programs for specialized qualifications. These
qualifications are in addition to core missions for the unit and do not apply to all intelligence
personnel assigned or attached to the unit. These programs are intended to provide the Chiefs of
Wing Intel the minimum approved ST programs for individuals with no previous qualifications
and may be tailored for intelligence personnel with current qualifications, prior experience,
currency, documented performance or formal training. Unless governed by a formal syllabus,
these programs will consist of unit-developed academics and scenarios.
5.2. External Intelligence Trainer (EIT) Specialized Training. This program establishes the
minimum guidelines for intelligence personnel identified by the Chief of Wing Intelligence to
progress to EITs within the unit. Only qualified EITs may conduct unsupervised external
intelligence training. There are two types of EITs: AIT and Force Protection Intelligence

A4.1. Gradesheets. The AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet, will be used by Intelligence
Qualification Trainers to record completion of Initial Qualification Training (IQT), Mission
Qualification Training (MQT) and Specialized Training events. Gradesheets will be filed in the
trainee’s qualification training record. Intelligence Evaluators will use the gradesheets to assist
in the completion of the AF Form 4350. After the AF Form 4350 is complete, the used
gradesheets are no longer required to be maintained and may be destroyed by the IE. (T-2)
A4.2. Required Task Elements. The following tables in this attachment include the minimum
task elements to be graded during each MQT event. As a minimum, each numbered element
(i.e., “1. C-130 Systems”) will receive a grade of 1-3. Grades will be considered in aggregate to
determine the overall grade for the event. Sub-elements are listed to provide additional detail as
necessary. For the C-130 Intelligence Academics Gradesheet all knowledge events are
represented on this one gradesheet. The trainer will use a separate gradesheet when grading each
knowledge event. Therefore, the trainee will have, at a minimum, a C-130 Intelligence
Academics Gradesheet on file for each event: C-130 Systems, AOR Threats, Personnel
Recovery, Intelligence Integration in Force Protection and Research, Analysis and
Dissemination. (T-2)
