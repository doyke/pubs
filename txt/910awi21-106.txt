1. Definition:
     1.1. A Functional check flight (FCF) is a flight that occurs after inspections, maintenance or
     acceptance of aircraft to assure the aircraft is airworthy and capable of accomplishing the
     mission. Conditions that create the requirement to accomplish the FCF/OCF are defined per
     Technical Order 1C-130A-6 or a decision exercised by commanders.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC), through Quality Assurance (MXQ),
     will provide supervision and accomplish administration of all functional check flights (FCF)
     and/or operational check flights (OCF).
     2.2. Maintenance Supervision (Pro-Super/ISO Flight Chief) informs the Plans and
     Scheduling Office of any FCF /OCF requirements due to maintenance performed or aircraft
     acceptance. Plans and Scheduling will then coordinate the FCF/OCF with the Quality
     Assurance Office. Quality Assurance notifies the 910 Operations Group Commander
     (OG/CC) or representative of the FCF/OCF requirement, date and time of FCF/OCF and
     aircrew briefing.
     2.3. The OG/CC is responsible for reviewing and ensuring qualified aircrews are performing
     the FCF/OCF.
3. Procedures.
     3.1. Per T.O. 1-1-300, FCF/OCF will be conducted using the minimum aircrew required to
     perform check flight duties or accomplish in-flight requirements. Check flights will be
     accomplished without cargo and nonessential passengers.
     3.2. Weight and Balance: Department of Defense (DD) Form 365-4, Weight and Balance
     Clearance Form-F Transport, will be accomplished for each flight by the loadmaster.
     3.3. Inspection and Preparation of Aircraft Maintenance Records: After the aircraft preflight
     has been accomplished, approximately two hours prior to FCF/OCF aircrew briefing, the
     aircraft crew chief will provide Quality Assurance the present and transcribed AFTO Form
     781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Quality Assurance will review the
     records to determine that the necessary maintenance and inspections have been accomplished
     and required entries or transcription have been completed.
     3.4. Fuel Load: Standard fuel load for FCF's is 28,000 pounds. The aircraft commander will
     determine if more or less fuel will be required for the planned flight profile.
     3.5. Scheduling of FCF/OCFs: After being informed of the FCF/OCF requirement, the
     Plans and Scheduling office will schedule the FCF/OCF after coordinating with the
     Operations Group. After the FCF aircrew has been scheduled, Plans and Scheduling will
     confirm the date and time with Quality Assurance.
4. Functional Check Flight (FCF)/Operational Check Flight (OCF) Crew Briefs: Prior to
the flight engineers preflight, the aircraft commander, co-pilot, navigator (if required), flight
engineer and loadmaster will report to Quality Assurance to review the forms and the planned
flight profile. Quality Assurance will brief all maintenance discrepancies that are pertinent to the
FCF/OCF crew prior to release of the aircraft. Quality Assurance will provide the aircrew with
the FCF/OCF checklist for review prior to flight.
910AWI21-106 14 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    3


5. Control and Accomplishment of FCF/OCF.
   5.1. The FCF flight profile will be planned to accomplish checks of those aircraft systems
   marked in the T.O. 1 C-I30E(H)-6CL-l checklist. Quality Assurance will number the FCF
   checklist TO IC-I30E(H)-6CL-I consecutively, using the last two digits of the current year
   followed by a dash and a number starting with "01" for the first FCF accomplished for the
   year. Numbering will continue in this order until the end of the calendar year (i.e., 00-01, 00-
   49, 0070).
   5.2. When OCFs are accomplished to check specific equipment or systems, only applicable
   portions of the checklist will be used. OCFs will be flown by experienced aircrews (not
   required to be an FCF qualified aircrew) and will be accomplished following the same
   maintenance criteria as FCFs.
   5.3. Each crew member will carefully evaluate each FCF checklist (T.O. lC-130E(H)-6CL-I)
   item relative to crew position, record all discrepancies discovered on the AFTO Form 78IA,
   and sign the "Discovered By" block per TO 00-20-1. All discrepancies found must be
   annotated in the aircraft forms in detail to assist in the maintenance action. Quality
   Assurance will assign job control numbers to discrepancies discovered during FCF.
   5.4. High-speed taxi checks may be accomplished instead of FCFs with coordination of
   OG/CC and MXG/CC approval, provided conditions in AFI 21-101 Para. 8.18 are met (Ref:
   LCL-910AW-10-1). Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks as per AFI 11-
   2C-130V3.
6. Completion of the FCF.
   6.1. Upon completion of the FCF, the aircrew will return the completed checklist (TO 1C-
   30E(H)-6CL-I) and the aircraft forms to Quality Assurance. Quality Assurance will debrief
   the aircrew, review the checklist and aircraft forms for accuracy, and ensure all required
   AFTO forms have been completed. If the aircraft commander has determined that all aircraft
   systems have met the criteria in TO 1C-130E(H)-6CL-1, the aircraft commander will release
   the aircraft. Once the aircraft has been released, Quality Assurance will forward the checklist
   to Plans & Scheduling to be filed in the aircraft document file. Quality Assurance will also
   update the FCF/OCF log and keep a copy of the checklist to be filed. If the aircraft
   commander does not release the aircraft, maintenance and aircrew will discuss the
   discrepancies and appropriate maintenance action will be taken prior to the aircraft being
   scheduled for another FCF/OCF.
   6.2. Quality Assurance will review the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Forms 781A,
   after corrective actions for FCF discrepancies are complete.
   6.3. Aircraft Disposition on Completion of FCF: In the event additional maintenance or
   flight checks are necessary, the aircraft will be returned to the Production Superintendent
   through Quality Assurance.
   6.4. FCF aborts: All ground aborts result in a non-release. An aircraft may be released for
   flight if a malfunction occurs during an FCF which is not related to the condition generating
   the FCF and the original condition checks good.
7. Transient Aircraft Requirements.
4                                                    910AWI21-106 14 FEBRUARY 2013


    7.1. The owning organization provides the FCF aircrews to accomplish the FCF otherwise
    all rules apply to the transient aircraft as it would to a unit C-130 aircraft.
