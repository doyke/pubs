     2.9. Hazardous Materials Pharmacy (HAZMART):
        2.9.1. The HAZMART will be responsible for managing the receipt, storage, issue, and
        distribution of all HAZMAT. The HAZMART will ensure that all requests for
        HAZMAT have been approved and authorized for use on Grand Forks AFB by all
        approving agencies prior to the purchase of hazardous materials. Customers will submit
        an AF IMT 3952, Chemical Authorization Request Form, prior to the purchase of any
        HAZMAT. This includes any purchase made with a Government IMPAC Card,
        contractor purchased/used, contracting purchased or supply transactions. Upon approval
        of AF IMT 3952, the HAZMART or other designated Material Control section will affix
        a bar-code tracking label to indicate that the material is being tracked within the
        HAZMART. Periodic inspections will be conducted to ensure adherence to the program.
        2.9.2. Upon receipt of HAZMAT, receiving personnel will examine containers to ensure
        containers are identified and labeled with the identity of the HAZMAT, appropriate
        hazard warning, and the name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer, importer,
        or other responsible party; and verify MSDSs are received or on file in the Grand Forks
        AFB MSDS master file. If the MSDS is missing or the container is not properly labeled
        or marked, receiving personnel have the option to refuse the material or contact the
        supplier for the necessary paperwork. MSDSs obtained with the shipment will be
        forwarded to the customer.
        2.9.3. Prior to issue, ensure that all unlabeled HAZMAT are properly labeled using
        Hazardous Chemical Warning Labels (DD Form 2521 8 1/2 in x 11 in or DD Form 2522
        4 in x 6 in), or equivalent.
3. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs):
     3.1. The work area MSDS file or database will be readily available to all workers in either
     hard copy or electronic form. Supervisors must ensure access to workers during all work
     shifts.
     3.2. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS access
     must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted. The back-up system may
     include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at another non-
     impacted location, telephone, fax, or access through a nearby HAZMART or BE Flight.
     Local judgment must be used to determine an adequate back-up system on a case-by-case
     basis.
     3.3. The MSDS on file must match the manufacturer and part number/trade name of the
     HAZMAT on-hand. In addition, the MSDS preparation date must be consistent with the
     date/lot of any HAZMAT on-hand. If a new MSDS is received, but the old HAZMAT is still
     on-hand, the MSDS, which matched the old HAZMAT, must be retained.
     3.4. Any industrial work center where employees must travel between work places during
     the work shift (e.g., their work is carried out at more than one geographical location) may
     keep the MSDSs at the primary work place facility. In this situation, employees must have
     immediate access to the MSDS information for emergencies.

4. Employee Information and Training:
   4.1. Commanders will ensure supervisors of work areas using HAZMAT receive training
   using guidance found in AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7.
   4.2. Supervisors will ensure subordinate workers are trained IAW AFI 90-821, paragraph
   2.7, “Employee Information and Training.” Supervisors should supplement this training to
   provide information on work area specific HAZMAT. Before presenting supplemental
   training, the supervisor will ensure appropriate agencies (i.e., BE, PH, Safety, and Fire)
   review the information for technical accuracy.
   4.3. Prior to starting work, each newly assigned person will receive a health and safety
   briefing and orientation that include at a minimum the following information and training:
      4.3.1. An overview of the requirements contained in the HAZCOM program.
      4.3.2. Activities/processes where HAZMAT is present and/or used. Reference Activity
      Evaluation/Recommendation at Attachment 1 of the BE Health Risk Assessment Survey
      Report.
      4.3.3. Location of the HAZCOM Binder and MSDS file or database.
      4.3.4. How to read labels and MSDSs to obtain hazard information including relevant
      hazard categories (flammable, carcinogenicity, etc.) and HAZMAT with specific
      regulatory requirements (benzene, lead, asbestos, etc.).
      4.3.5. Physical and health risks of each HAZMAT.
      4.3.6. The symptoms of overexposure.
      4.3.7. How to determine the presence and/or release of HAZMAT in the work area.
      4.3.8. How to reduce or prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals through use of control
      procedures, work practices, and personal protective equipment.
      4.3.9. Steps taken to reduce or prevent exposure to HAZMAT.
      4.3.10. Spill response procedures and emergency procedures to follow if employees are
      exposed to HAZMAT.
      4.3.11. How to locate, properly use, and maintain controls (engineering, administrative
      and personal protective equipment).
   4.4. There is no annual requirement for HAZCOM training; however, if a new HAZMAT is
   introduced into the work center, supplemental HAZCOM training on the new HAZMAT will
   be conducted and documented IAW para 2.3.7.2. of this instruction.
5. HAZMAT Inventory:
   5.1. The HAZMAT inventory must include a list of the HAZMAT known to be present in a
   work area/shop. Supervisors will ensure all HAZMAT maintained in the work center has
   been approved and is listed on the EESOH-MIS Authorized Users List.
   5.2. This listing will be kept current and reflect a complete and accurate inventory of all
   HAZMAT used in the work area. When new HAZMAT is introduced into the work area, the
   supervisor will add them to the inventory and contact BE to conduct a new health risk
   assessment of the process. A current listing may be obtained through the HAZMART or BE.

5.3. BE will review this inventory during the routine industrial hygiene surveillance
survey.
6. Non-Routine Tasks:
   6.1. Non-routine tasks are:
       6.1.1. Those tasks included within work areas’ normal activities utilizing or involving
       HAZMAT but performed infrequently; for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing
       the solvent, or cleaning up spills.
       6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Codes
       (AFSC) or job series.
   6.2. The supervisor will ensure work area operating instructions thoroughly describe non-
   routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls, for the infrequent tasks performed in this
   work area. Operating instructions do not need to be prepared if TOs or other official
   documents adequately describe these tasks. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine
   tasks performed in this work area which involve HAZMAT on the Specific HAZCOM
   Training Plan located at Attachment 1.
   6.3. Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing the non-
   routine tasks.
