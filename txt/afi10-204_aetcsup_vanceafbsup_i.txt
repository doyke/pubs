                                             Chapter 1

                    EXERCISE GUIDELINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. Exercises play an essential role in preparing United States Air Force (USAF)
forces to conduct air, space, and cyberspace operations and perform their mission essential tasks.
This Instruction provides direction and additional policy guidance regarding Air Force
participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP) and the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
(CJCS)-designated exercises that constitute the Joint Exercise Program (JEP). It supports the
Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training, CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual for
the Armed Forces of the United States, and CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and
Guidance for the Armed Forces of the United States. It defines actions and responsibilities
during the exercise cycle and outlines procedures for programming and budgeting exercise
funds. It establishes organizations and processes to help manage Air Force NEP/JEP exercise
participation and support.
1.1. (AETC)Purpose. As HAF guidance for installation-level exercises is limited, this
supplement will serve as AETC guidance to installation-level exercises. This core AFI, despite
that it is geared toward Joint and National exercises, embodies many installation-level exercise
concepts. This supplement lays the foundation for the HQ AETC Exercise Program. The
purpose of the HQ AETC Exercise Program is to support the Air Force Exercise Program and
provide guidance and policy to IEPOs.
1.2. Objective. Air Force units participate in NEP and JEP exercises to hone and refine their
execution of mission essential and supporting tasks, validate training, improve response
capabilities, and enhance and evaluate readiness. The Air Force goal is to optimize the benefits
of participating in these exercises.
1.2. (AETC)Objective. Establish HQ AETC/A3OX as AETC’s centralized agency for
standardized installation exercise procedures and policies IAW DoD and AF directives, as well
as HQ AETC/CC direction. In order to enhance effective planning and coordination,
installations tasked to support and/or participate in National Exercise Program (NEP) or Joint
Exercise Program (JEP) exercises will notify HQ AETC/A3OX within 20 calendar days of
exercise tasking via email from the IEPO Chief.
1.3. Exercise Guidelines.
     1.3.1. Concept. Exercises must embody a “train the way we fight” philosophy and should
     exercise actual command relationships as much as possible. Exercises should provide
     opportunities to assess real-world capabilities consistent with safety, security, and overall
     exercise objectives. When appropriate, exercises should also incorporate other requirements
     and operational challenges, such as logistics, support, force protection, and the ability to
     operate in a degraded/contaminated environment, including biological, radiological, and
     nuclear (CBRN) environments. Whenever possible, exercises should seek to employ and
     evaluate current or proposed plans, policies, procedures, processes, Warfighter Challenges,
     and doctrine.
     1.3.1. (AETC) Concept. Exercise planners should strive to replicate the operational
     environment as closely as possible for all exercise events. In order for the players to achieve
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                                   7


   the appropriate exercise objectives, simulations should be kept to a minimum and used only
   when real world procedures create excessive risk or prohibitive expense.
   1.3.2. Conditions. Exercises give commanders an opportunity to assess the ability of their
   units to perform their missions and should be conducted and examined under “no-fault”
   conditions. Exercise participants should have the “freedom to fail” within the bounds of safe
   operations and the need to meet exercise objectives. Per CJCSI 3500.01E, assessments for
   CE2 exercise will be recorded in the Joint Training Information Management System
   (JTIMS). Unless part of a formal inspection, do not grade individual or unit performance.
   Formal inspections, such as operational readiness inspections (ORIs), may be conducted
   during exercises provided graded events are clearly identified to all exercise participants and
   grading will only affect inspected units.
   1.3.2. (AETC) Conditions. Unless otherwise directed by the installation commander, HQ
   AETC-directed and installation exercises will be graded.          For efficiencies and
   standardization, recommend using HQ AETC Inspector General (IG) grading criteria.
   1.3.3. Linking Exercises. To take advantage of the synergy that exists when exercises
   require similar skill sets and have common venues, scenarios, and objectives, Air Force
   Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting
   Units (DRUs) should consider linking their sponsored exercises with CJCS-sponsored,
   CCDR-sponsored, or other appropriate exercises whenever possible.
   1.3.3. (AETC) Linking Exercises. If possible, installations should use NEP or JEP
   exercises and other required training to fulfill some of the exercise requirements contained in
   Emergency Management, Medical, Force Protection, Information Protection, tenant unit
   exercise requirements, etc.
        1.3.3.1. Scheduling. Participating in NEP and JEP exercises and also supporting Air
        Force-sponsored exercises places considerable stress on Air Force units and often strains
        available assets. Force providers must determine their ability to support all exercise
        requirements as they develop their exercise schedules and make exercise commitments.
        1.3.3.1. (AETC) Scheduling. Installation Commanders, in coordination with the IEPO
        Chief, will ensure all required exercises are scheduled and executed IAW applicable
        directives and timelines. HQ AETC/A3OX will assist this requirement by documenting
        and posting all “known” exercise requirements on the HQ AETC Operations, Plans and
        Programs Community of Practice. Units and Functionals can assist this requirement
        through cross-flow of information to A3OX when exercise requirements are added or
        deleted in functional AFIs. Annual installation exercise schedules for the next calendar
        year will be submitted by the IEPO Chief to A3OX by 15 Dec of the current year. Plan
        and develop an annual exercise schedule to the example below (Figure 1.1).

     1.3.4. Support Requirements.
        1.3.4.1. Participants. Exercises provide participants the opportunity to practice actions
        and procedures in an instructive environment. To ensure the appropriate personnel
        benefit from this exercise experience, role players and substitutes for key personnel
        should be kept to a minimum.
        1.3.4.2. War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM may be used to provide Indirect Mission
        Support for Joint Chiefs of Staff and Air Force exercises with proper
        approval/authorization and funding, as outlined in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel
        (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. WRM assets will not be used for exercises
        without appropriate release authority.
        1.3.4.3. Preparation. Exercise planners should review operational, logistical, support,
        and force protection requirements, command relationships, applicable plans, After
        Actions Reports (AAR), lessons learned databases, corrective action reports, observation
        reports, and guidance from higher headquarters to determine appropriate exercise
        objectives and ensure the exercise design supports meeting these objectives.
        1.3.4.4. Environmental Compliance. Exercise sponsors will ensure exercises conducted
        in the United States, its territories, and possessions comply with applicable Federal, State,
        interstate, and local environmental requirements. Air Force exercise planners will ensure
        compliance with AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) for
        all Air Force-sponsored exercises. Exercises conducted at Department of Defense (DoD)
        installations in foreign countries will comply with AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program
        in Foreign Countries.
        1.3.4.5. Contractor Support for Exercises. The contract statement of work is the source
        document for contractor duties and responsibilities. Contractor support for exercises
        must be confined to the services specified by contract or negotiated during the exercise
        planning process.
        1.3.4.5. (AETC) The IEPO Chief will coordinate with the installation Contracting
        Officer and Judge Advocate staff during exercise development if a contracted function is
        to be exercised and evaluated. The following paragraphs outline several required
        safeguards to be used when evaluating contracted activities during exercises to prevent
        claims and protests resulting from exercising and evaluating contracted functions. The
        IEPO Chief will:
             1.3.4.5.1. (Added-AETC) Request, from the contracting officer or the contracting
             Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) member, the Statement of Work/Performance Work
             Statement and associated contract documents from the inspected unit.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                              9


       1.3.4.5.1. (VANCEAFB) Contractor personnel supporting the Vance AFB
       Operations and Maintenance umbrella contract are required to participate in exercises
       in accordance with their contract during normal business hours. Exercises requiring
       contractor overtime must be coordinated through the 71 CONF/LGC for
       Administrative Contracting Officer approval and authorization.
          1.3.4.5.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) All other contractors (such as construction
          project personnel) are exempt from participation in exercises. These contractors
          can expect vehicle searches or momentary delays when entering the base during
          exercises. An alternate route will be established for these vehicles so they do not
          interfere with exercise actions and requirements when necessary.
       1.3.4.5.2. (Added-AETC) Develop contract evaluation areas in coordination with
       the contracting officer or the contracting EET member.
       1.3.4.5.3. (Added-AETC) Consult the contracting officer or the contracting EET
       member when contract interpretation is necessary.
       1.3.4.5.4. (Added-AETC) Ensure the contracting officer and/or Contracting Officer
       Representative (COR) accompany the EET member during exercise evaluations.
       1.3.4.5.5. (Added-AETC) When feasible, provide a copy of their exercise schedule
       to the contractor’s project manager through the contracting officer to avoid
       unreasonable interruptions of contractor performance. The exercise schedule will
       also be provided to the COR.
       1.3.4.5.6. (Added-AETC) Ensure EET members do not direct contractor
       performance or direct the contractor to correct deficiencies. If an EET member notes
       an imminent danger to personnel or equipment, he or she will take immediate action
       to mitigate the hazard and notify the contracting officer.
       1.3.4.5.7. (Added-AETC) Ensure contract compliance is validated with the COR
       and the contracting officer/administrator.
       1.3.4.5.8. (Added-AETC) Ensure the AAR for contracted activities exercised
       includes these evaluated areas:
          1.3.4.5.8.1. (Added-AETC) Government Oversight. This area will include all
          contractor surveillance responsibilities, including but not limited to, the COR and
          any associated processes and surveillance documents, functional commanders,
          and interface with contracting personnel.
          1.3.4.5.8.2. (Added-AETC) Mission Impact. Include a subjective assessment
          of the value added to the mission by the contracted activity.
          1.3.4.5.8.3. (Added-AETC) Contractor Performance/Compliance.                 This
          includes an assessment of contractor compliance with contract terms and
          conditions. Deficiencies in this area will reference the governing contract.
          Specific comments regarding contractor performance will be included under a
          separate contractor report. The unit (or responsible organization) contracting
          office is responsible for addressing performance issues with the contractor.
10                            AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013


        1.3.4.5.9. (Added-AETC) Ensure contractor performance/compliance reports are
        not released to the contractor.
        1.3.4.5.10. (Added-AETC) Commanders must reply to answerable contractor
        performance/ compliance deficiencies in exercise reports. The respective contracting
        officer is the Office of Collateral Responsibility and will coordinate on the reply. At
        minimum, replies will address formal government actions taken by the contracting
        officer in response to contractor deficiencies. Only contracting officers are
        authorized to direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during exercise
        evaluations.
        1.3.4.5.11. (Added-AETC) Ensure details of individual contractor performance are
        not included in any out-brief.
     1.3.4.6. Status of Forces Agreement for Combined Exercises. Whenever USAF forces
     participate with other countries in any combined exercise, the United States should have a
     status of forces agreement (SOFA) or similar arrangement with all participating
     countries. If a SOFA does not exist with any country, such an agreement should be
     negotiated and concluded in advance of the exercise in accordance with DoD Directive
     (DoDD) 5530.3, International Agreements, AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding,
     Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements, and AFJI 51-706, Status of Forces
     Policies, Procedures, and Information. If in doubt as to the existence of such an
     agreement with regard to a particular country or for assistance in preparing an agreement,
     contact Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the General Counsel, Deputy General
     Counsel for International Affairs (SAF/GCI).
  1.3.5. Exercise Management. The Air Force will develop the following products and use
  the following organizations to optimize exercise support and participation.
     1.3.5.1. Exercise Management Products.
        1.3.5.1.1. Weight of Effort (WoE). The WoE is a prioritized scoring matrix
        developed to assist Air Force senior leaders in making personnel and equipment
        apportionment decisions for exercise support functions, such as Air and Space
        Operations Center (AOC) augmentation, exercise control group support, and
        modeling and simulation (M&S) support. The WoE utilizes quantitative grading
        criteria to identify which exercises provide the greatest training benefit for USAF
        units. The WoE is not intended to be used for prioritization of funding.
        1.3.5.1.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES). The GES is the annual schedule of
        exercises requiring support from Air Force exercise control and M&S organizations.
        Air Combat Command (ACC) develops and maintains the GES.
     1.3.5.2. Exercise Management Organizations.
        1.3.5.2.1. Air Force Joint Exercise Coordination Team (AFJECT). The AFJECT is
        an action officer-level working group responsible for developing a validated GES.
        Additional guidance is at Attachment 2.
        1.3.5.2.2. Exercise Integrated Process Team (EIPT). The EIPT is a multi-command,
        colonel-level organization responsible for coordinating and addressing cross-
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                                11


        MAJCOM exercise issues and developing the WoE.              Additional guidance is at
        Attachment 3.
        1.3.5.2.3. Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG). The EGOSG is an
        executive level forum to address exercise-related issues and AF support to CSAF,
        Combatant Commander (CCDR), and MAJCOM/CC exercise requirements and
        priorities. Additional guidance is at Attachment 4.
  1.3.6. National Exercise Program (NEP). DoD Components will support the NEP in
  accordance with DoDI 3020.47, DoD Participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP).
     1.3.6.1. Scope. The NEP is run by the Department of Homeland Security and provides a
     framework for prioritizing and focusing Federal exercise activities. It is the principal
     mechanism for examining the overall preparedness of the United States Government
     (USG) and enables Federal departments and agencies to examine and evaluate national
     policies, plans, and strategies during the management of domestic catastrophic events,
     such as CBRN incidents, as a result of attack or natural disaster.
     1.3.6.2. Tiers. The NEP Implementation Plan categorizes exercises into the following
     tiers that reflect priorities for interagency participation:
        1.3.6.2.1. Tier I. This is the highest priority level. Tier I exercises are centered on
        White House directed, USG-wide issues and require the participation of appropriate
        department and agency principals along with their operations centers and staffs.
        1.3.6.2.2. Tier II. These are Federal department/agency exercises with a focus on
        USG strategy, policy, and procedural issues meriting priority for national and
        regional Federal interagency participation. Each department or agency will determine
        their level of actual or simulated support for NEP Tier II exercises.
        1.3.6.2.3. Tier III. These are other Federal exercises focused on plans, policies and
        procedures at the regional, operational, or tactical level not requiring broad
        interagency headquarters-level involvement. Participation at the national level is at
        the discretion of each department or agency.
        1.3.6.2.4. Tier IV. These are exercises in which State and local government, and/or
        private sector entities are the primary exercise audience.
     1.3.6.3. National Level Exercise (NLE). The NLE is the single annual operations-based
     NEP Tier I exercise and requires the participation of all appropriate department and
     agency principals.
     1.3.6.4. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) serves as the DoD POC to the
     NEP and orchestrates overall DoD NEP execution.
        1.3.6.4.1. The Air Force will participate in NEP Tier I exercises when appropriate
        given the scenario or when tasked by either the ASD (HD&ASA) or by CJCS or his
        or her representative.
        1.3.6.4.2. Unless directed by higher authority, Air Force participation in Tier II, III,
        and IV NEP exercises is at the discretion of MAJCOM and unit leadership.
        1.3.6.4.3. A tasked MAJCOM will notify AF/A3O-ATT and the requesting agency
        when they cannot provide requested exercise support to any NEP exercise.

      1.3.6.5. AF/A3O-ATT will monitor Air Force participation in NEP exercises.
      1.3.6.6. Air Force organizations that participate in a NEP exercise will:
          1.3.6.6.1. Fully support exercise planning, execution, and evaluation.
          1.3.6.6.2. Provide trusted agents, as needed, to design and control the exercise.
1.3. (AETC) Exercise Guidelines.
1.4. Nuclear Exercises.
   1.4.1. MAJCOM/CCs are responsible to ensure MAJCOM nuclear exercises are conducted
   properly. MAJCOM/CCs are the waiver approval authority, unless delegated to the CV, for
   movement/cancellation of scheduled nuclear exercises which are MAJCOM directed or
   higher.
   1.4.2. NAF/CCs are responsible to ensure NAF nuclear exercises are conducted properly.
   NAF/CCs are the waiver approval authority, unless delegated to the CV, for
   movement/cancellation of scheduled nuclear exercises which are NAF directed or higher.

                                          Chapter 2

                                     EXERCISE CYCLE

2.1. Exercise Cycle. The exercise cycle consists of the planning, execution, and evaluation
phases needed to create, conduct and assess an exercise.
2.2. Planning Phase. The planning phase encompasses all aspects of building an exercise and
as a minimum should address the following areas:
2.2. (AETC)Planning Phase.
   2.2.1. Exercise concept. The exercise concept guides and focuses the planning effort. It
   identifies the exercise type (e.g. command post exercise (CPX), field training exercise (FTX),
   etc.), the major participants, the level of exercise play, the broad scenario profile and the
   plans, procedures, and activities that are the primary exercise focus.
   2.2.1. (AETC) Exercise concept. Pre-Exercise Briefing: The EET Chief will conduct a
   pre-exercise briefing for EET members. EET members will not disclose objectives and
   sequence of events to parties who do not have a need to know. Use the AETC EET Guide to
   plan and conduct pre-exercise briefings.
   2.2.2. Exercise objectives. Exercise objectives are the precise, action-oriented statements
   that identify the goals for the exercise. Objectives should be developed around tasks from
   applicable Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs). When participating in linked exercises,
   Air Force exercise objectives should be compatible with those of the other exercise(s).
   2.2.2. (AETC) Exercise objectives. Wing XP (or equivalent), in conjunction with the
   Crisis Action Team (CAT) Coordinator and CAT members, will develop exercise objectives
   and inputs for the CAT.
       2.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) Unit Commanders and Wing Staff agencies, in conjunction
       with respective EET members, will review and develop exercise objectives that are
       executable, can be validated, improve response capabilities, and enhance readiness IAW
       functional requirements.
       2.2.2.1. (VANCEAFB) Unit commanders and wing staff agencies will meet with the
       evaluators of participating units to determine exercise scenarios and objectives. Previous
       deficiencies should be reviewed. Limiting factors will be discussed and scenarios
       thoroughly examined to develop the most realistic and challenging exercise possible.
       Evaluators will work closely with their organizational commanders to ensure exercise
       objectives are realistic and test units’ capabilities.
   2.2.3. Exercise plans (EXPLANs). EXPLANs should typically follow the standard
   Operations Plan (OPLAN) format found in CJCSM 3122.03C, Joint Operation Planning and
   Execution System (JOPES), Vol II--Planning Formats and Guidance, and contain pertinent
   annexes. When appropriate, participating Air Force organizations (HAF, MAJCOM, etc)
   will assist the exercise sponsor with EXPLAN development. Depending on exercise
   complexity, duration and level of participation, Air Force organizations may, at their
   discretion, create an organizational EXPLAN to clarify exercise requirements and
   responsibilities.
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                               19


  2.2.3. (AETC) Exercise plans (EXPLANs). IEPOs will develop an installation Exercise
  Plan (EXPLAN), OI or supplement to this instruction within 180 days of the publication date
  of this supplement. EXPLAN or OI development is recommended as these can be updated
  faster than a supplement.
  2.2.4. Exercise control. Exercise execution is managed by controllers who are
  knowledgeable in the timing and content of exercise events. Air Force planners should
  determine the number and location of control elements and the exercise control procedures
  needed to provide overall exercise management and support the accomplishment of Air Force
  objectives. Planners should prepare and provide exercise controllers the support materials
  needed to manage exercise execution.
  2.2.4. (AETC) Exercise control. An exercise control staff consists of an EET Chief, White
  Cell Chief Controller, EET, White Cell staff, Trusted Agents or other personnel as necessary.
  In many instances, manpower restrictions will dictate modifications.
  2.2.5. Training. Exercises are a training program adjunct and provide an opportunity to
  practice trained actions and procedures during simulated situations in a controlled
  environment. Exercise organizations must determine the training their exercise players
  require to properly prepare them for a particular exercise and then ensure the training is
  accomplished before the exercise.
     2.2.5.1. (Added-AETC) The IEPO Chief, in coordination with the Functional EET,
     should review governing exercise AFIs to determine applicable training requirements.
     2.2.5.2. (Added-AETC) The IEPO Chief will work with the installation Emergency
     Management Branch to ensure EET members complete required training.
     2.2.5.3. (Added-AETC) EET Chief will ensure exercise controllers are trained to
     successfully carry out exercise responsibilities.
     2.2.5.4. (Added-AETC) EET members will complete initial training in the Advanced
     Distributed Learning System at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil, under Emergency
     Management. Training must be complete within 60 calendar days of appointment.
     2.2.5.5. (Added-AETC) Personnel will not act as evaluators during exercises unless
     appointed by unit commander and all required EET training is complete.
     2.2.5.6. (Added-AETC) Additional training requirements, as directed by the
     installation, will depend on each member’s functional expertise and which exercises they
     will assess.
     2.2.5.7. (Added-AETC) All unit and group-level EET members should take Unit
     Control Center (UCC) web-based training and localized training.
     2.2.5.8. (Added-AETC) For Deployment Exercises, readiness evaluators must be able
     to use the AF IMT 2511, Deployment Schedule of Events - Cargo, AF IMT 2511A,
     Deployment Schedule of Events - Passenger, and AF IMT 2512, Deployment Schedule of
     Events – Loading Schedule as backup for developing and disseminating manual
     Deployment Schedule of Events, in the event the Logistics Module application is
     unavailable or network limitations prevent its use. (See AFI 10-403, Deployment
     Planning and Execution.)      Additionally, evaluators must review the installation
     deployment plan to determine how the IMT forms will be used as a back-up during
20                             AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013


     contingencies and inspections as well as work with the installation deployment officer to
     review the manual process, which is required prior to facilitating/evaluating an exercise.
  2.2.6. Exercise Player Materials. One of the goals of the exercise program is to practice,
  validate, and reinforce established procedures. To help support this goal, whenever possible,
  exercise information should be communicated using established procedures. Exercise-
  specific player materials should only be created when normal communication tools or
  procedures do not exist to provide required exercise information.
     2.2.6.1. Exercise player material must not divulge trusted agent information or release
     any event information before the scheduled time of the event.
     2.2.6.1. (VANCEAFB) Exercise material and information are considered privileged and
     must be protected. Evaluators must maintain exercise confidentiality. Ensure exercise
     documents are marked “EET Eyes Only” or “For Control Eyes Only.”
     2.2.6.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Telephone. If a checklist item calls for telephonic
     contact with an off-base agency, exercise participants will contact the agency to verify
     the phone number and the EET will evaluate contact procedures. Do not involve
     contacted agency in exercise participation unless coordinated and approved in advance.
     2.2.6.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Messages. All required messages and reports, including
     those to be sent off base, will be prepared as if for actual transmission but marked with
     “NOT FOR TRANSMISSION.” In addition, the top and bottom of the document will be
     marked “EXERCISE EXERCISE EXERCISE.” All messages must meet the required
     suspense and must be submitted to the White Cell, unless otherwise directed.
     2.2.6.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) All documents generated for exercise purposes will be
     clearly marked “EXERCISE EXERCISE EXERCISE” at the top and bottom of every
     page.
     2.2.6.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) The base public address system (Giant Voice) can be
     used for exercises as directed by the appropriate checklist or approval authority. The
     system is designed as an “alert medium” to notify personnel of conditions requiring
     action. Detailed post-incident information should be provided by telephone, or other
     methods of communication.
     2.2.6.6. (Added-VANCEAFB) Do not use prepared messages for Giant Voice or other
     notification systems in situations where real-world circumstances could confuse base
     personnel if the message content is only partially understood. For example, do not
     instruct personnel to “seek shelter” during an FPCON exercise if there is a real-world
     weather watch or warning which could also cause them to seek shelter.
  2.2.7. Master Scenario Event List (MSEL). Typically, the MSEL is a chronological
  database of planned events and expected player actions that exercise controllers use to
  manage and guide the exercise to achieve exercise objectives.
     2.2.7.1. The MSEL is the scenario game plan for the exercise and should only be
     accessible to trusted agents and must not be released to exercise players.
     2.2.7.1. (AETC) The MSEL will list chronological events by the inject date and time
     group and contain at least one MSEL event for each objective, with a determination of
     how and when to inject the event, as well as who would most logically cause or report the
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                               21


     event. The MSEL will also reflect all munitions, smoke-generating devices or ground-
     burst simulators planned for use and name of the individual responsible for initiating the
     pyrotechnic device during the exercise.
     2.2.7.2. The exercise sponsoring organization is responsible for directing and overseeing
     MSEL development and creating and maintaining the MSEL database.
         2.2.7.2.1. Trusted agents from participating Air Force organizations will review the
         MSEL and ensure planned events support Air Force objectives.
             2.2.7.2.1.1. Air Force planners will coordinate on events that require Air Force
             participation and, when appropriate, create or change events to meet Air Force
             exercise requirements.
             2.2.7.2.1.2. When necessary, planners will attend MSEL Development and/or
             Synchronization Conferences to oversee scenario development and execution
             coordination.
  2.2.8. Trusted Agents. Trusted agents are subject matter experts who are given advance
  knowledge of exercise scenario details for the purpose of assisting with exercise development
  and planning.
     2.2.8.1. To maintain the integrity of exercise information, organizations should limit the
     number of trusted agents to the absolute minimum required to support proper planning.
         2.2.8.1.1. To maintain exercise planning continuity, trusted agents should be capable
         of serving from the start of exercise planning through execution.
         2.2.8.1.2. Trusted agents should not be principal players during exercise execution
         since advance knowledge of exercise events can significantly decrease the benefit
         players receive from an exercise.
     2.2.8.2. As a minimum, trusted agent information is For Official Use Only and should
     remain close-hold within the exercise planning community. Exercise information should
     not be released outside the planning community without the approval of the primary
     planning staff of the sponsoring organization for an exercise.
  2.2.9. Exercise planners. Planners must be knowledgeable in the procedures, plans, and
  processes being exercised.
     2.2.9.1. The following references provide detailed information on the Joint Training
     System (JTS) and the Joint Event Life Cycle (JELC) and can assist exercise planners in
     the design, conduct and evaluation of exercises:
         2.2.9.1.1. CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and Guidance for the Armed
         Forces of the United States.
         2.2.9.1.2. CJCSI 3500.02, Universal Joint Task List Policy and Guidance for the
         Armed Forces of the United States.
         2.2.9.1.3. CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual (JTM) for the Armed Forces of
         the United States.
  2.2.10. Observers. Observers are a vital link in the exercise process. They ensure exercise
  objectives are met, provide on-the-spot instruction and capture lessons learned and/or best
 22                              AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013


   practices for the after-action report and inclusion in the Joint Lessons Learned Information
   System (JLLIS). They can also recommend and coordinate event changes when required
   during exercise execution.
   2.2.11. Communication and Testing. Communication Setup and Testing are important
   exercise preparation steps and should include validation of all certifications and
   accreditations, end-to-end communications checks, and systems interoperability verification.
   2.2.12. (Added-AETC) Training Aids. HQ AETC wings are only permitted to use inert
   simulated training weapons for exercise purposes when exercising in populated areas or
   using “role players” as perpetrators. All exercise participants, including first responders,
   must use inert simulated training weapons made of rubber or plastic, red or blue in color and
   clearly marked “Training Aid.” No other forms of simulated training weapons are
   authorized. Exception: Non-players. (Non-Player is anyone outside the established cordon,
   not including those guarding the cordon.)
2.3. Execution Phase. The formal execution phase begins with deployment of exercise
participants or STARTEX and continues until ENDEX.
2.3. (AETC)Execution Phase. The EET Chief will obtain installation commander approval
before establishing or conducting an exercise. The commander will determine appropriate levels
of participation for personnel directly involved in training operations. This will ensure exercises
are as effective as possible without negative impact on the primary training mission. Brief the
airfield operations flight commander at least 48 hours in advance of an exercise that will involve
an air traffic control facility or airport movement area. The airfield operations flight commander
must approve, in advance, exercises that move controllers to alternate facilities or shelter areas.
Execute the exercise scenario on the date and time planned or as modified by the EET Chief.
Once an exercise begins, it continues until all objectives have been met and, with the EET
Chief’s recommendation, the installation commander terminates. Ideally, the scenario should
proceed to a logical end point. However, the EET Chief or installation commander may
terminate the exercise early in the event safety concerns or conflicting real-world emergencies
arise, or when all exercise objectives are met.
   2.3.1. Controllers manage the direction, pace, and intensity of exercise play in accordance
   with the exercise control plan established by the exercise sponsoring organization.
       2.3.1.1. When required, an Air Force Exercise Control Group (AFECG) will oversee and
       manage the exercise activity of Air Force exercise participants.
           2.3.1.1.1. The AFECG will not include exercise players and will be tailored to
           support the size and scope of the exercise and meet the exercise needs of participating
           Air Force organizations.
       2.3.1.2. White Cell. Since all organizations do not participate in every exercise, White
       Cell personnel will replicate the actions or inputs of non-participating organizations that
       are needed to keep exercise activities on track. White Cell personnel will not be exercise
       players but are trusted agents and may also perform controller functions.
       2.3.1.2. (AETC) Exercise Control Center (White Cell).
           2.3.1.2.1. (Added-AETC) Purpose. All exercises require command and control.
           The White Cell has been implemented to provide a single cell of personnel to monitor
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                             23


       and control MSEL or exercise flow, act as HHQ, direct role players, enforce time
       implements, etc. The control system for any exercise should ensure that it follows the
       approved scenario, attains the minimum objectives, ensures smooth development and
       provides meaningful, realistic training to all exercise participants.
       2.3.1.2.2. (Added-AETC) Organization. To control exercises, the Chief Controller
       or Deputy IEPO Chief organizes the White Cell and uses available personnel
       effectively to provide the largest benefit to the exercise. They should possess the
       knowledge to make sound decisions if the EET Chief is unavailable. Establish
       sufficient controller work space and assign roles and responsibilities to each
       controller.
          2.3.1.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) The composition of the White Cell depends upon
          the type of exercise and the echelon at which it is conducted as well as the method
          (sometimes called the exercise implementer), which sustains the exercise and
          causes it to flow to a logical conclusion. White cell composition also depends on
          the MSEL sequence of events, simulations, role players, phone calls, faxes, e-
          mails or a combination of these that may drive an exercise as well as objectives
          from notional higher and adjacent headquarters or support agencies.
          2.3.1.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) White Cell personnel represent all higher,
          subordinate, adjacent, and support agencies not physically present on the
          installation or participating in the exercise (e.g. HAF, HHQ, etc.) The White Cell
          Chief Controller must ensure the appropriate exercise echelon is established as
          well as the appropriate personnel assigned to serve at each echelon.
          2.3.1.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) Each White Cell should be equipped with controller
          workspace, phone, computer and land mobile radio or base station, along with the
          White Cell instructions. Each White Cell should be staffed with individuals
          possessing sufficient knowledge to ensure exercise flow.
          2.3.1.2.2.4. (Added-AETC) White Cell Controllers ensure that events take place
          at the right time and place per the scenario and schedule. EET helps determine
          the flow of exercise incidents, Command and Control, contingency Plans,
          obstacles and support activities.
          2.3.1.2.2.5. (Added-AETC) EET reports outcomes and status of exercise
          objectives to the White Cell. EET members observe activities to determine
          whether tasks are performed to standard. Ideally, no one should serve as
          controller and EET member during the same exercise. However, based on
          manning constraints, the EET Chief may assign personnel to more than one role.
          2.3.1.2.2.6. (Added-AETC) As the focal point for controlling each exercise, the
          White Cell will portray HHQ of the player unit or installation when the
          appropriate HHQ is not participating. It will also be responsible for the
          administration and logistics necessary to support the exercise. Subordinate
          control centers, if used, will coordinate activities through White Cell if the
          installation command and control systems are not activated to support the
          exercise. For example, the White Cell may assume the role of the CAT,
          Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or other Command & Control node to
24                            AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013


           support the accomplishment of the exercise objectives.
     2.3.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Simulations.
        2.3.1.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) During a deployment exercise, personnel
        substitutions, backfills and/or shortfalls will be accomplished IAW AFI 10-403,
        Deployment Planning and Execution, unless otherwise specified in the deployment
        order.
        2.3.1.3.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Unless specifically exempted by the 71
        FTW/XPE, do not use deploying team members and equipment once deployed or
        simulated as deployed in concurrent exercises until termination of all exercises.
        Release the people to an alternate duty location or return them to their duty stations if
        their duties do not directly support other elements of the exercises. Similarly, set
        aside equipment identified for deployment, and isolate equipment to be transferred to
        other base agencies. Do not use the same items to support other exercise
        requirements.
        2.3.1.3.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Gas masks will not be issued to personnel without
        a real-world deployment tasking. However, personnel should be prepared to
        demonstrate the process.
        2.3.1.3.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) Personnel on leave or TDY who could have been
        recalled during an actual deployment may be simulated as present and processed
        during deployment exercises. If this is done, identify the individual(s) as simulated
        by placing “SIM” on their deployment orders or the outside of their deployment
        folder. Records and mobility bags of simulated personnel will be available for
        inspection.
        2.3.1.3.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) Movement of controlled medical items. Activity
        will be simulated using containers of similar size.
        2.3.1.3.6. (Added-VANCEAFB) Transportation of hazardous cargo.           Do not
        transport explosives or other hazardous/sensitive cargo. Capability to move these
        items will be demonstrated, but movement from storage will not occur during
        exercises. Munitions will be simulated with crates of similar size.
        2.3.1.3.7. (Added-VANCEAFB) If base sirens are used during an exercise, the base
        populace, surrounding civilians, and local civil authorities should be advised well in
        advance. Sirens will not be sounded for exercises during real-world severe weather
        watches or warnings.
        2.3.1.3.8. (Added-VANCEAFB) Simulate Individual Mobilization Augmentee
        (IMA) recall. Prepare paperwork and obtain required information from the individual
        when possible, but do not process orders or recall the IMA to Vance AFB.
        2.3.1.3.9. (Added-VANCEAFB) Security Forces stop-check-pass procedures at the
        base gates may be demonstrated. After 30 cars are passed and checked, the 71
        FTW/CC may choose to simulate continuing the procedure until it is no longer
        required or the exercise is terminated.
        2.3.1.3.10. (Added-VANCEAFB) Base gate closure procedures for increased
        FPCON, active shooter, etc., may be demonstrated. Once the capability is fully

       demonstrated (not to exceed 10 minutes) and evaluated by an exercise evaluator, the
       gate(s) will re-open for normal traffic unless otherwise directed by the 71 FTW/CC.
       2.3.1.3.11. (Added-VANCEAFB) The medical group will simulate transport of
       casualties to civilian medical facilities unless participation of these facilities is
       coordinated in advance. EET will reserve and staff an 8-passanger van from base
       transportation or base transportation will provide a van and a driver to serve as the
       exercise ambulance. The exercise ambulance will be initially dispatched through
       EET channels when requested by the IC. Times required from the notification to
       arrival will match real world drive times from the respective hospital to the exercise
       scene.
       2.3.1.3.12. (Added-VANCEAFB) Shutoff of base utilities will be simulated by
       identifying the cutoff point and dispatching personnel to touch the controls or explain
       on-scene procedures to the evaluator, unless otherwise directed. EXCEPTION:
       Facilities with backup power must be prepared to put the alternate power source
       online and operate the facility on alternate power.
       2.3.1.3.13. (Added-VANCEAFB) Power or communications outages with the
       potential to adversely impact emergency response capability (i.e., fire, medical,
       security forces) or ongoing flying operations will be simulated. Exercise participants
       will identify and, when possible, use alternative resources or facilities.
       2.3.1.3.14. (Added-VANCEAFB) Unless previously coordinated with local
       officials, simulate actual extension of required cordons beyond the base perimeter.
       However, be prepared to demonstrate the capability by contacting appropriate
       agencies if requested by EET.
       2.3.1.3.15. (Added-VANCEAFB) Communications with off-base agencies or
       individuals will be made to the White Cell when possible, unless prior coordination
       was made, except to verify phone numbers or response times. However, correct
       telephone numbers or other means of contact must be readily available.
          2.3.1.3.15.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Making contracts with off-base vendors.
          Contracting personnel will simulate contracting with off-base vendors for rental
          or purchases of services/supplies to support an exercise. In addition to preparing
          paperwork, they will provide a planned source, estimated cost, and date/time of
          availability when possible. Demonstrating contact of sources may be required if
          requested by the inspector/evaluator.
              2.3.1.3.15.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Request for Purchase, Government
              Transportation Requests (GTR), Government Bill of Lading (GBL), and other
              forms needed to acquire transportation or locally procured material. Prepare,
              but do not process, these documents. Documents prepared for exercises must
              be marked accordingly.
          2.3.1.3.15.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Prepare all required reports to off-base
          agencies and submit to the CAT, the EOC director, or the White Cell, as
          appropriate. Do not transmit any reports off base, unless directed by higher
          headquarters or EET evaluators.

       officially end the exercise (ENDEX). When all exercise objectives are met, the EET
       Chief or Deputy EET Chief will coordinate with the 71 FTW/CC or the 71 FTW/CV for
       official ENDEX.
       2.3.3.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) Anyone may stop an exercise for safety or a real-world
       event by stating or transmitting “knock it off” three times on any exercise communication
       medium. The 71 FTW/CC, the 71 FTW/XPE or the EET Chief will decide whether or
       not to continue the exercise after a “knock it off” call. Evaluators are expected to step in
       to prevent injury or property damage before it occurs. Safety calls will not be questioned.
       2.3.3.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) The EET Entry Access List (EAL) can be used for
       unescorted entry into controlled areas on base. The list is prepared by the EET chief and
       endorsed by the 71 FTW/CV. The EAL contains the name, rank, SSAN, and security
       clearance of individuals who are authorized access. Unit Control Centers (UCCs) and
       unit entry control points should maintain a copy of the current EAL. NOTE: FOLLOW
       APPROPRIATE REGULATORY GUIDANCE IN CONTROLLING ACCESS TO
       CLASSIFIED AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION.
          2.3.3.5.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) EET badges or vests do not constitute authority to
          enter controlled/restricted areas or grant access to classified information.
2.4. Evaluation Phase. The evaluation phase is a critical part of the exercise process and
enables participants to evaluate and assess exercise actions, propose changes, and share this
information with others. After Action Reports (AARs) and Lessons Learned (L2) actions are
key elements of this phase.
   2.4.1. AARs. Participating Air Force organizations should develop an AAR that
   summarizes exercise activities, evaluates actions, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and
   makes recommendations, as appropriate.
   2.4.1. (AETC) AARs. Participating Air Force organizations should develop an AAR that
   summarizes exercise activities, evaluates actions, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and
   makes recommendations, as appropriate. (Added) (See Attachment 5 for example AAR).
       2.4.1.1. Participating Air Force organizations will follow the guidance in AFI 90-1601,
       Air Force Lessons Learned Program, for posting and forwarding AARs.
       2.4.1.1. (AETC) AARs must be distributed to HQ AETC/A3OX NLT 20 working days
       after the exercise event. A3OX will review AARs prior to submitting to the AF Joint
       Lessons Learned Information System (AF-JLLIS.)
          2.4.1.1.1. (Added-AETC) All contingency/event AARs that do not request exercise
          credit must be submitted to AF-JLLIS by the installation NLT 30 working days
          following the event.
          2.4.1.1.2. (Added-AETC) Mark after-action reports as “FOR OFFICIAL USE
          ONLY.” Note: This report may be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of
          Information Act. Do not release or publish, in whole or in part, outside official DoD
          channels unless authorized by DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act
          Program (and appropriate subordinate supplements when applicable).

   2.4.2. Lessons Learned. The Air Force Office of Lessons Learned (AF/A9L) is the OPR
   for the Air Force Lessons Learned Process (AFL2P).
      2.4.2.1. Unless otherwise directed by exercise protocols, all participating Air Force units
      will comply with the observation, collection, reporting, validation, dissemination, and
      tracking procedures contained in AFI 90-1601.
   2.4.3. The    Air      Force    Joint     Lessons    Learned Information System
   (https://www.jllis.mil/USAF) is the Air Force and DoD system of record for the
   management of all Air Force observations, L2, and AARs.
2.5. (Added-AETC) Requesting Exercise Credit.
   2.5.1. (Added-AETC) Installations requesting exercise credit for Contingency/Real-World
   events will submit an MFR signed by the commander or designated representative with a
   copy of the AAR to AETC/A3OX for review NLT 20 working days after the event. A3OX
   will coordinate the Contingency/Real-World exercise credit request with appropriate
   Functional Area Managers to ensure applicable credit is granted as it is earned.
   2.5.2. (Added-AETC) In order to receive exercise credit, real-world events will be
   evaluated to ensure successful completion of current exercise objectives. Additionally,
   lessons learned (strengths, deficiencies and recommended improvement areas) must be
   identified and an AAR must be accomplished and submitted to AETC/A3OX.
2.6. (Added-AETC) Hotwash/Debrief.
   2.6.1. (Added-AETC) After the exercise, the EET and trusted agents convene in a closed
   session “Hotwash” to review and assess the exercise. This initial debriefing is closed to other
   exercise participants to enable evaluators and EET members to freely discuss exercise
   activities. All deficiencies will be validated and recommended improvement areas discussed
   with exercise participants after this closed session.
   2.6.2. (Added-AETC) After the exercise, the EET Chief will critique the exercise with the
   installation commander before conducting the open session to debrief exercise participants
   (no later than 30 days after the exercise).
2.7. (Added-AETC) Corrective Actions.
   2.7.1. (Added-AETC) The EET recommends revised procedures to installation
   commander. His/her designated representative or working group (e.g., the Emergency
   Management WG) should review exercise results for exercises required by AFI 10-2501 as a
   minimum and advise on appropriate corrective actions. Deficiencies will be identified to
   HHQ in AARs and are considered corrected only when corrective action is completed,
   approved by the commander or designated representative, and validated by another exercise
   or test of the applicable procedure.
   2.7.2. (Added-AETC) Unit Commander or equivalent must ensure discrepancies identified
   in AARs are corrected and must ensure a written response is provided to the IEPO Chief by
   the established suspense date. If corrective actions cannot be completed as directed, follow-
   up reports must be submitted at least monthly until corrective actions are complete. Unit
   Commanders will send response information copies to the Civil Engineer Readiness and
   Emergency Management Flight.

                     EXERCISE FUNDING AND PROGRAMMING

3.1. General Information.
   3.1.1. The Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2) account funds Air Force
   participation in Joint Exercise Program (JEP) exercises. The CE2 account is programmed by
   the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness (OUSD (P&R)) and
   is managed by the Joint Staff (JS)/J-7 with support from US Joint Forces Command
   (USJFCOM).
   3.1.2. Exercise funding and programming actions occur within the DoD biennial Planning,
   Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.
   3.1.3. Air Force organizations will comply with the JEP provisions in CJCSI 3511.01A,
   Joint Exercise Transportation Program.
3.2. Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2) Account.
   3.2.1. The CE2 account provides funds for the following types of exercise activities:
      3.2.1.1. Incremental Expenses. CE2 provides Service Incremental Funding (SIF) to pay
      for the incremental O&M activities incurred solely for, or as a direct result of, planning
      for or taking part in a CE2-funded exercise. Valid incremental activities include such
      items as lodging, per diem, non-aviation fuel, consumable supplies, contract support, and
      communications. It does not include costs funded in other AF accounts, such as flying
      hours.
      3.2.1.2. Transportation. Exercise transportation includes airlift, sealift, Port Handling
      (PH), Inland Transportation (IT), and the Commercial Ticket Program (CTP).
      Transportation funding generally covers the cost of transporting personnel and equipment
      from a unit’s home station to the exercise area and return. Commercial air travel from
      home station to and from the aerial port of embarkation (APOE), however, is a Service
      responsibility. Active duty, ANG, and AFRC forces can receive CE2 Transportation
      funds.
          3.2.1.2.1. Port Handling (PH). Port handling includes commercial contract expenses
          to receive or dispatch cargo for an exercise at Port of Embarkation (POE) and Port of
          Debarkation (POD) associated with Military Sealift Command (MSC) for sealift and
          Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) for commercial shipping.
          PH expenses include documentation, terminal handling, and stevedoring.
          3.2.1.2.2. Inland Transportation (IT). Inland transportation funds purchase approved
          point-to-point transportation service associated with the movement of exercise
          participants and cargo, between the units’ home base/installation to and from a
          POE/POD and to or from the exercise area, by commercial-for-hire firms when
          organic transportation is not available or cost effective. Movement is by surface
          transportation (rail, highway, and inland waterway).          Using vehicles where
          commercial drivers are included in the lease/ticket price is permissible. The leasing
          of commercial vehicles (e.g., passenger vans), however, is specifically excluded and
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                                33


         should not be confused with commercial-for-hire firms, including bus lines.
         Transportation expenses associated with temporary duty, exercise conferences, and
         air travel are specifically excluded from IT funding.
         3.2.1.2.3. Commercial Ticket Program (CTP). This program supports individual
         commercial air travel during exercise execution when military airlift or commercial
         air charter cannot satisfy the sponsoring command’s transportation requirements.
         CTP is used only when United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)-
         provided common-user transportation cannot satisfy the CCDR-validated exercise
         Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). CTP funds can only be used to
         purchase commercial airline tickets. CTP funds do not cover per diem or movement
         to the APOE or from the APOD. Once CTP requirements are determined for a
         particular exercise, USTRANSCOM will post the CTP authorization message on their
         Single Mobility System (SMS) website.
   3.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT is responsible for managing the disbursement of CE2 funds associated
   with Air Force participation in JEP exercises.
      3.2.2.1. Funding for JEP exercises is based on requirements identified in the Joint
      Training Information Management System (JTIMS). Exercise sponsors, planners, and
      participants should ensure the accurate and timely entry of required JTIMS data.
      3.2.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT will use Emergency and Special Project (ESP) codes to track CE2
      expenditures by exercise. To facilitate exercise expenditure accounting, Air Force
      organizations will ensure that all exercise fund cites contain the proper ESP code.
3.3. CE2 Funds Management.
   3.3.1. PH/IT Funds.
      3.3.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of PH/IT
      funds.
      3.3.1.2. Transportation Account Codes (TAC). MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should use
      TACs to fund PH/IT requirements whenever possible. When a TAC is not viable,
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will request PH/IT funding per paragraph 3.3.1.3.
      3.3.1.3. Funding Request. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU exercise planners will send a PH/IT
      funding request to AF/A3O-ATT (afa3oatt.workflow@pentagon.af.mil) as soon as the
      PH/IT need is known. The PH/IT funding request will include the exercise name,
      number of passengers and/or total weight of cargo (in short tons), and the estimated cost.
         3.3.1.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will forward the PH/IT request to JS/J7 (JEXD). The JS
         Comptroller will post the funds on the Program Budget Accounting System (PBAS)
         for the respective MAJCOM/FOA/DRU.             MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs are then
         responsible for getting funds to the appropriate units and for tracking PH/IT
         obligations by exercise name and ESP code.
   3.3.2. CTP Funds.
   3.3.2. (AETC) CTP Funds.
      3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of CTP
      funds.
 34                             AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013


       3.3.2.2. Funding Request. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit their CTP requests IAW
       AF/A3O-ATT-issued guidance.
          3.3.2.1.1. JS/J7 will process CTP requests and distribute CTP funds IAW the most
          current JS/J7 Joint Exercise Transportation Program, Commercial Ticket Program
          Implementation Guidance.
          3.3.2.1.1. (AETC) HQ AETC/A3OX is responsible for managing and requesting
          Commercial Ticket Program (CTP) funds for participation in JEP exercises.
   3.3.3. SIF Funds.
       3.3.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will oversee the distribution of                 SIF   funds    and
       MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation of SIF funds.
       3.3.3.2. Funding Request.    MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will follow SIF procedures in
       paragraph 3.5.
   3.3.4. CE2 funds are authorized to support specific approved exercise expenses and may not
   be redirected to fund any other activities. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs must track PH/IT, CTP,
   and SIF obligations separately.
3.4. Exercise Funds Responsibilities.
   3.4.1. JEP Exercises.
       3.4.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT is the AF OPR for managing CE2-supplied SIF.
       3.4.1.2. JS/J-7 (JEXD) is the OPR for managing CE2-supplied PH, IT, and CTP funds.
       AF/A3O-ATT will coordinate consolidated AF requests for these funds to JS by exercise.
       3.4.1.3. All AF organizations will comply with JCS exercise funding guidance in AFI
       65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Table 10.3.
   3.4.2. Non-JEP Exercises. Air Force organizations conducting unilateral or other joint
   exercises not within the approved JEP must fund these exercises from their own O&M
   accounts. For Air Force-sponsored non-JEP exercises, the MAJCOM or Air Force
   organization sponsoring an exercise is generally responsible for funding the exercise.
   3.4.3. Combined Exercises. Combined exercises should have a written arrangement with
   the foreign participant(s) that includes the authority for the exercise, the scope of the
   exercise, status of US personnel (paragraph 1.3.4.6), and funding procedures, as
   appropriate. Any US training provided to participating countries should be handled under
   available legal authority, such as by a foreign military sales (FMS) case or cross-servicing
   agreement under Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authority.
3.5. HAF Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process for Service
Incremental Funding (SIF).
   3.5.1. During the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development process,
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit their Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) SIF
   requirements for JEP exercises to AF/A3O-ATT.
       3.5.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT will consolidate Air Force requirements and submit the Air Force
       SIF request to OUSD(P&R).
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                                   35


      3.5.1.2. OUSD(P&R) incorporates AF SIF requirements into the overall Defense-wide
      CE2 request as part of the President’s Budget (PB).
   3.5.2. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act establishes the amount of CE2 funds
   appropriated for the upcoming execution year. Congress must approve and the President
   must sign this act for funds to be available. If the appropriations act is not signed before the
   beginning of the execution year, funding is generally available under a continuing resolution.
   3.5.3. OUSD(P&R) will determine AF SIF funding for the current execution year and
   publish this information as part of the CE2 Program Execution Plan (PEP). Once the AF SIF
   allocation is known, AF/A3O-ATT will provide execution year fiscal guidance to AF
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs.
      3.5.3.1. If a MAJCOM/FOA/DRU encounters an unanticipated SIF requirement during
      the current fiscal year, the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU should notify AF/A3O-ATT of the
      requirement. The notification should include sufficient explanation to justify a request
      for additional funds. If AF/A3O-ATT cannot fund the requirement from existing AF SIF
      resources, when deemed appropriate, they will submit an Unfunded Requirement to the
      Joint Staff for additional funds from the CE2 Program.
      3.5.3.2. AF SIF must only be obligated to fund valid JEP exercise activities.
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should notify AF/A3O-ATT when they have excess SIF funds.
      Ultimately, SIF funds not needed to support AF exercise participation requirements revert
      back to OUSD(P&R) control for reallocation against other CE2 program requirements.
3.6. Tracking and Reporting.
   3.6.1. PH/IT and CTP funds are distributed per the procedures in paragraphs 3.3.1 and
   3.3.2 respectively. SIF funds are distributed per AF/A3O-ATT-issued fiscal guidance.
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will track transportation funds (Z5 funds) sub-allocated from the
   Joint Staff.
      3.6.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should track all JEP expenditures using assigned ESP
      codes. Questions concerning the use of ESP codes should be addressed to AF/A3O-ATT.
   3.6.2. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit monthly SIF obligation reports to AF/A3O-ATT
   by the third working day of the following month.
      3.6.2.1. AF/A3O-ATT will submit a consolidated SIF obligation report to OUSD(P&R)
      within the first week of the month following the report month.
   3.6.3. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit monthly obligation reports (Flash Reports) for
   funds sub-allocated from the Joint Staff. Flash Reports will be submitted to the Joint Staff
   Comptroller with info to AF/A3O-ATT by the third working day of the following month.
3.7. Funding for Aerial Refueling of Foreign Aircraft during Combined Exercises.
   3.7.1. USAF tankers flying aerial refueling missions to exclusively support US aircraft
   during combined exercises can also refuel foreign aircraft on the same mission provided the
   following conditions are met:
      3.7.1.1. Refueling of foreign aircraft is conducted on a strictly opportune, non-
      interference basis.
36                              AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013


     3.7.1.2. Exercise tanker missions are scheduled based on supporting US exercise mission
     requirements only.
     3.7.1.3. Tanker loiter time is not added to exercise tanker missions simply to
     accommodate non-exercise refueling operations.
     3.7.1.4. Foreign governments must pay for the fuel offloaded in accordance with USAF
     instructions and procedures (for example, pursuant to the terms of a reciprocal fuels
     agreement, cross-servicing agreement, or FMS case).
  3.7.2. If the foreign aircraft refueling operation does not increase the required flying time of
  the planned exercise-only refueling mission, the foreign government must only pay for the
  offloaded fuel.
     3.7.2.1. If the foreign aircraft refueling takes place outside the “envelope” for meeting
     USAF mission requirements and time is added to the planned exercise refueling mission
     to support foreign aircraft refueling operations, the foreign government must also pay for
     the additional flying hours along with the offloaded fuel.
  3.7.3. When a combined exercise utilizes USAF tankers to refuel foreign aircraft as part of
  the exercise, the refueling of foreign aircraft can be conducted on a less than full cost
  reimbursement basis provided that:
     3.7.3.1. The purpose of the combined exercise is to employ coalition force concepts of
     operations that require USAF aerial refueling of foreign aircraft in support of DoD
     mission requirements;
     3.7.3.2. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise approves of conducting the
     refueling on a less than full cost reimbursement basis;
     3.7.3.3. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise notifies AF/A3O-AT and
     AMC/FMF with a command coordinated memorandum specifying the aerial refueling
     operations that will be conducted on a less than full cost reimbursement basis. The
     memorandum should be submitted NLT 30 days prior to the exercise and include:
         3.7.3.3.1. A description of the operation, including objectives;
         3.7.3.3.2. The US mission requirements to be satisfied;
         3.7.3.3.3. A list of expenses to be assumed by the DoD and the funding source;
         3.7.3.3.4. A list of expenses to be assumed by the foreign government, including
         method of payment to DoD for required reimbursements.
  3.7.4. If the foreign aircraft aerial refueling does not meet the criteria set forth in
  paragraphs 3.7.1 or 3.7.3., aerial refueling must be conducted on a full reimbursement basis.
  The foreign government must pay for all applicable costs, such as offloaded fuel,
  boom/drogue time, tanker transit time, and loiter time.
  3.7.5. Foreign Aerial Refueling Requirements.
     3.7.5.1. Foreign receiver pilots and commercial and foreign tanker crews participating in
     aerial refueling operations during exercise missions involving USAF tankers or receivers
     must be qualified in and use USAF aerial refueling terminology and procedures as
     specified in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allied Tactical Publication
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                                37


      (ATP)-56(B),            Air             to                    Air              Refuelling
      (http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/airtoair56b.cfm).
          3.7.5.1.1. Per ATP-56(B), qualified foreign pilots and commercial and foreign boom
          operators must meet aerial refueling currency requirements or adhere to published re-
          currency procedures.
          3.7.5.1.2. Exercise aerial refueling missions will not be used to qualify or requalify
          foreign receiver pilots, or commercial or foreign boom operators as this is the
          provision of a defense service to the foreign country that requires a FMS case or
          cross-servicing agreement under ACSA authority, as appropriate (see DoDD
          5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Chapter 10.5).
      3.7.5.2. Tanker and receiver aircraft operated commercially or by foreign nations must
      be certified as technically compatible for aerial refueling operations with USAF receiver
      and tanker aircraft. Information about foreign receiver aircraft that are technically
      compatible with USAF tankers, commercial and foreign tankers that are technically
      compatible with USAF receivers, and instructions for requesting a technical compatibility
      assessment are published in ATP-56(B), Annex Z, US National Annex.
3.8. (Added-AETC) Exercise Munitions Account.
   3.8.1. (Added-AETC) The IEPO should be familiar with the process to forecast practice
   munitions according to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management.
   Note: AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions, outlines munitions available for EET
   use.
   3.8.2. (Added-AETC) IEPO will work with installation munitions accountability systems
   officers (MASO) to obtain Ammunition/Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMMO/AMST)
   account and to schedule practice ground munitions training for select EET members. The
   MASO reports the installation munitions request and allocation in the Global Ammunition
   Control Point and establish procedures.
   3.8.3. (Added-AETC) If the IEPO does not have a munitions account, and munitions are
   used for exercises, a memorandum documenting how exercise munitions are used and
   maintained for exercises must be kept by the IEPO.
   3.8.4. (Added-AETC) Effective exercise planning is essential to alleviating costly
   munitions expenditures; purchasing bird cannons, smoke machines, etc., is a suitable
   substitute for munitions and provides environmentally safe realisms to any exercise.
   3.8.5. (Added-AETC) EET members designated to employ smoke generating devices or
   ground burst simulators must be trained and qualified on the use of the devices as well as
   required protective equipment IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
   3.8.6. (Added-AETC) If explosives are used during an exercise, the EET Chief will prepare
   an inventory of devices to be used and accomplish a risk assessment, in coordination with
   Wing Safety prior to use. The installation commander must approve the use of training
   munitions IAW AFMAN 91-201.

                                        Attachment 2
          AIR FORCE JOINT EXERCISE COORDINATION TEAM (AFJECT)

A2.1. Overview. This attachment outlines the organization, responsibilities and procedures for
the AFJECT and describes the process for developing the Global Exercise Schedule (GES).
ACC/A3J Division Chief is the AFJECT Chairperson and delegated authority to coordinate
USAF support for joint and USAF service-level training events to include Flag exercises, Joint
National Training Center (JNTC) events and functional command events.
A2.2. Objective. The objective of the AFJECT is to coordinate, schedule, and deconflict, as
required, the Air Force Air & Space Operations Center (AOC), Control and Reporting Center
(CRC), Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW),
assets assigned by the EIPT and any other MAJCOM units/assets used to support USAF,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), COCOM-sponsored and other MAJCOM
exercises and experiments. The AFJECT uses the GES to accomplish this task.
A2.3. Organization.
   A2.3.1. The AFJECT is an action officer (AO) level working group made up of exercise
   planners, schedulers and support staff from the member organizations listed in Para 3.3. and
   chaired by the ACC/A3J Division Chief. The Chairman is the spokesperson for the AFJECT
   and approves all team decisions.
   A2.3.2. The AFJECT will submit a coordinated and validated GES to the Exercise
   Integrated Process Team (EIPT) and Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG), in
   turn, for approval. This approval chain will also be used to address unresolved exercise
   support issues that occur during the GES development process. If required, MAJCOM
   representatives can also engage the EIPT or EGOSG to reclama exercise scheduling conflicts
   or other AFJECT decisions. In all cases, issues will be resolved at the lowest appropriate
   level.
   A2.3.3. Membership. As a minimum, the following organizations will have representatives
   on the AFJECT:
       A2.3.3.1. ACC
       A2.3.3.2. PACAF (AFPAC)
       A2.3.3.3. USAFE (AFEUR)
       A2.3.3.4. AFSPC
       A2.3.3.5. AFMC
       A2.3.3.6. AETC
       A2.3.3.7. AMC
       A2.3.3.8. AFSOC
       A2.3.3.9. AFGSC
       A2.3.3.10. ANG
       A2.3.3.11. AFRC
AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013                                                   47


      A2.3.3.12. 1AF (AFNORTH)
      A2.3.3.13. 8AF (AFSTRAT)
      A2.3.3.14. 9AF (AFCENT)
      A2.3.3.15. 12AF (AFSOUTH)
      A2.3.3.16. 14AF (AFSTRAT-SP)
      A2.3.3.17. 17 AF (AFAFRICA)
      A2.3.3.18. 24AF (AFCYBER)
      A2.3.3.19. GCIC
      A2.3.3.20. AFAMS
      A2.3.3.21. 505 CCW
      A2.3.3.22. Representatives from other organizations may attend and participate with
      prior approval from the AFJECT Chairperson.
A2.4. AFJECT Process:
   A2.4.1. AFJECT Conferences. The AFJECT will hold up to two conferences per year.
   The first conference, normally held in the Spring, will prioritize and deconflict, as required,
   the next year’s exercise and experiment schedules. It is normally scheduled NLT 90 days
   after the Spring Joint Staff (JS) Worldwide Joint Training and Scheduling Conference
   (WJTSC). The second conference, normally held in the Fall, will address the exercise
   schedule for the ensuing 18-24 months, provide exercise related updates and address any
   emerging issues. This second conference will typically use video teleconference (VTC)
   capabilities to minimize travel requirements and encourage maximum participation.
   A2.4.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES) Preparation.
      A2.4.2.1. The GES is developed in one-year increments. The AFJECT program
      manager will develop five years of exercise schedules and maintain them on the AFJECT
      Community of Practice (CoP) website.
      A2.4.2.2. MAJCOM program and functional managers will identify/establish their
      command exercise requirements and submit them to the AFJECT program manager NLT
      2 months prior to each biannual AFJECT conference for posting onto the CoP. Exercise
      planners will work with the AFJECT program manager to determine resource availability
      and coordinate specific support requirements.
      A2.4.2.3. Six weeks prior to each conference, AFJECT members will review the GES
      and identify the exercises their units are participating in and annotate the exercise support
      resources they are requesting for their events (i.e. exercise control group, AOC manning
      augmentation, etc.). Any changes to GES information must be submitted to the program
      manager NLT two weeks before the conference.
      A2.4.2.4. In preparation for the AFJECT conference, the AFJECT program manager will
      post all scheduling changes, build a draft schedule and develop the AFJECT briefing.
      Functional program managers will review the updated schedule to determine unit
      supportability. MAJCOM planners/schedulers should attempt to resolve exercise
 48                             AFI10-204_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2013


       scheduling issues prior to the conference. Unresolved issues will be addressed during the
       conference.
          A2.4.2.4.1. Voluntary support to non-AFJECT scheduled events does not relieve a
          unit of the responsibility to support AFJECT scheduled requirements. Also, while the
          AFJECT does not schedule AFRC/ANG forces, AFRC and ANG units should utilize
          the GES to identify training and support opportunities.
       A2.4.2.5. Following the AFJECT conference, the program manager will draft the
       meeting minutes, update the GES, as required, and forward it to the EIPT and EGOSG, in
       turn, for approval. Once the GES is approved, the program manager will prepare the 505
       CCW tasking message for ACC/CV release.

MEMORANDUM FOR

FROM: 123 FW/XPI
      444 Anywhere Road, Suite 10
      Coastal AFB

SUBJECT: SILVER STAR 11-03, Natural Disaster Response Exercise/Pyramid Alert Recall
         Exercise

1. SUMMARY:

   a. Overall Rating: (If used).

   b. Exercise Date(s): 11-12 Mar 2011

   c. Type of Exercises: SILVER STAR 11-03 focused on a Natural Disaster Response
   Exercise (NDRE). It provided training and a realistic review of wing plans and checklists for
   the 2011 hurricane season. Additionally, the wing fulfilled the annual requirement of testing
   its Pyramid Alert Recall procedures.

   d. Exercise Objectives: The purpose of the exercise was to assess the wing’s capability to
   respond to emergency situations encountered during Hurricane Condition (HURCON) phases
   and to assess the response to emergency situations of such magnitude as to warrant a
   response by the base disaster response force. This exercise was also used to validate unit
   “closed” deficiencies from previous exercises. Specific functional exercise objectives are
   listed in Attachment 1 below and were evaluated by the Exercise Evaluation Team (EET).

2. Exercise Summaries:

   a. Hurricane: (Rating) Overall, the exercise provided worthwhile training for personnel in
   preparation for the hurricane season. It challenged the wing’s leadership at all phases of
   HURCON, from initial preparations to evacuation of jets and personnel, through recovery.
   “Hurricane Jackie” was the perfect storm in its predictability. The base leadership made all
   the right decisions, resulting in aircraft and personnel being evacuated in plenty of time to
   move to a safe haven. The base ride-out element met for a tabletop, providing excellent
   training for all team members. The Communications Squadron did an outstanding job
   moving all equipment required by CEMP 10-2.

      (1) Several lessons were learned from this exercise. The 123 TRG Shelter Management
      Team (SMT) developed an exceptional internal checklist that ensured shelter stocking,
      personnel in-processing and outlined daily SMT procedures that should be incorporated

       as an installation standard for all SMTs. To save valuable preparation time, the
       Hurricane Watch Team (HWT) will now have their meetings in the Command Post (CP);
       the location move was decided in the Commanders’ “Hot Wash”. This location will
       speed the flow of critical information, and reduce the time needed to complete HURCON
       checklists. Recommend, as a standard, the HWT meet 20 minutes prior to weather
       advisories being issued. The HWT could then recommend a CSS recall if warranted and
       be in place for questions. The CSS could then immediately issue directives. All
       directives need to be disseminated promptly and control centers need to pass to their units
       without delay.

       (2) The exercise also identified inconsistencies between the checklists and the different
       wing plans used. Some ride-out members did not bring checklists to the tabletop. Also,
       during the tabletop items were identified that need to be included into plans. Several new
       members of the ride-out team had not received training; members need to be identified
       with sufficient time to allow training. Recommend Building 909 complete a facility plan
       to ensure capability of housing all equipment required in current plans. Shelter stocking
       must be incorporated into next review of CEMP 10-2. Recommend Civil Engineer
       conduct a study to determine shelter possibilities of base buildings and also which
       buildings require generators due to storm damage.

   b. Pyramid Alert Recall (Ungraded): A test of the wing telephonic recall procedures began at
   0500L on Monday. Some confusion of the actual report times lessened the effectiveness of
   the recall. Recommend quarterly recall exercises until base populace and Group Control
   Centers (GCCs)/Unit Control Centers (UCCs) become familiar with procedures.

3. Lessons Learned (Strengths, Deficiencies, Recommended Improvement Areas (RIA)):

a. See Attachment 2.

b. All Deficiencies require a written response by the OPR listed (i.e. OPR: 123 FW/XPE). It is
the OPR’s responsibility to initiate corrective action as required. RIAs do not require a written
response. RIAs, both good and bad, contain information that can make effective procedures
even better.

c. Each organization identified as an OPR with a DEFICIENCY will report the corrective
action(s) to 123 FW/XPI (see Attachment 3 for sample letter). Suspense for reply is ______.
The following agencies have replies due:

instructions, OIs, plans, MFRs, etc. Ensure the corrective action offers a long-term fix to the
problem. (In most cases, corrective action may be accomplished by a change to an instruction,
OI, checklist, etc., or by altering materials used for periodic training to prevent a recurrence of
the finding. Corrective actions such as “individual has been briefed” do not normally provide
permanent fixes to identified problems.)
