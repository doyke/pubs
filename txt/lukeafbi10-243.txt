SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Revisions to LUKEAFBI 10-243 include updating paragraphs 2.4 and 7.1 to reflect the updates
published in AFI 10-403.
1. Program responsibilities.
     1.1. The Wing Augmentation Duty Program identifies places and codes, and trains personnel
     to meet augmentor needs for installation-level exercises, contingencies, wartime, or
     emergency situations. The term augmentation means that personnel will be utilized in areas
     other than their assigned duties. Augmentation, in this respect, is not justified for requesting
     changes to the Unit Manpower Document, reclama of an operations plan, or a deployment
     tasking. The Wing Augmentation Duty Program is designed to directly support the wing
     mission in a contingency.
     1.2. The Wing Augmentation Program is in place to manage augmentation of the following
     functions at Luke AFB:
        1.2.1. 56th Security Forces Squadron (56 SFS).
        1.2.2. 56 FW Deployment Machine.
2. Wing Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 56 FW/CC is responsible for determining if an augmentation program is required.
     If an augmentation program is required, it may be delegated to the vice commander and it is
     then a local decision on how the program will be implemented and managed.
     2.2. The 56 FW/CV is the Wing Augmentation Duty Program OPR and is responsible for the
     overall direction of the program. The OPR will establish and serve as the chair of the
     Augmentation Review Board (ARB), decide when to have ARB meetings, and appoint, in
     writing, the Wing Augmentation Program Manager. The vice wing commander is the sole
     approval authority for all augmentation call-ups.
     2.3. The 56 FW/CCC will ensure the Wing Augmentation Duty Program maintains 100 fully
     trained SFS augmentees at all times. As a maximum, up to 60 augmentees will rotate every
     60 calendar days. This requirement may be decreased or increased based upon real-world
     requirements or as directed by the 56 FW/CV. Any AFSC that is not exempt, and is in either
     AEF bands “D” or “E”, have the option to perform SFS augmentation duty on 30-day
     rotations. This action must be coordinated through the respective Group Superintendent and
     Command Chief. In conjunction with group coordinators, group commanders will ensure
     squadron personnel assigned as Security Forces augmentees are prepared to meet those
     requirements for a maximum of 120 days in two 60-day rotations. Based on strength and
     deployment tempo, SFS may need more than 60 augmentees to meet Force Protection
     Condition (FPCON) Delta posting requests. The FW/CV may task unit(s) beyond the 60
     augmentees as the threat dictates.
     2.4. The 56 FW Installation Deployment Officer, in conjunction with the 56 FW/CCC, will
     ensure the Wing Augmentation Duty Program identifies those positions within each
     deployment work center that require mandatory training. This training is based on excepted
     performance of the duties assigned to the required 55 deployment machine augmentees IAW
     AFI 10-403, Attachment 5, and will be completed as “just in time training” when needed, or
LUKEAFBI10-243 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                               3


   as directed by the 56 FW/CV. In conjunction with group coordinators, Group Commanders
   will ensure squadron personnel assigned as deployment machine augmentees are prepared to
   meet DEPLOYEX or real-world requirements up to a continuous rotation of 24-hour
   operations to meet the tasking objective.
3. The ARB.
   3.1. The ARB consists of the following personnel:
      3.1.1. Chairperson - 56 FW Vice Commander (Program OPR).
      3.1.2. Members - 56 FW Group Commanders (equivalent or deputies), 56 FW/CCC, and
      tenant organization equivalents.
      3.1.3. Advisors - 56 FW Manpower, 56th Force Support Squadron (FSS) Commander,
      Military Personnel Section (MPS) Commander, 56 SFS/CC, and the 56 LRS/CC.
      3.1.4. Wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager - As appointed by 56 FW/CV.
      3.1.5. Recorder - Alternate Wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager, as appointed by
      56 FW/CV.
   3.2. The fare share calculations used to determine the required augmentation numbers from
   each unit will be reviewed and recalculated annually due to downsizing.
   3.3. The ARB will meet annually if the fair share numbers are updated, or as directed by the
   56 FW/CV.
4. The Augmentation Working Group.
   4.1. The Augmentation Working Group (AWG) will facilitate the exchange of data, resolve
   program and personnel issues prior to an ARB, and maintain the overall program to ensure
   effectiveness. The AWG is designed to evaluate and update this instruction and any
   supporting documents for the augmentation program, providing recommendations to the
   ARB. The AWG receives guidance from the ARB and the Program Manager.
   4.2. The AWG will meet at least annually or as required by the Wing Augmentation Duty
   Program Manager. The AWG will consist of the following personnel: Chairman - 56 FW
   Augmentation Program Manager and the AWG members are as follows: 56 FW/CCC, 56
   FW Group Chiefs (equivalent representative in the grade of MSgt or above), 56 SFS/S3, 56
   SFS/S3T, 56 FSS/FSMM, 56 FW/XP, and 56 LRS/LGRDX.
5. Group and Squadron Commanders and Staff Agency Chief Responsibilities.
   5.1. Group and Squadron Commanders and Staff Agency Chiefs are responsible for
   managing all aspects of their unit’s augmentation program to include appointing unit POCs
   and personnel to meet wing mission requirements, ensuring personnel are properly screened
   and trained to perform augmentation duties, and tracking number of days personnel perform
   augmentation duty.
   5.2. Group and Squadron Commanders will be responsible for appointing individual
   augmentees and ensuring a current augmentee roster with all pertinent individual information
   including name, rank, and office symbol once the “just in time” training is initiated.
 4                                                      LUKEAFBI10-243 6 DECEMBER 2013


     5.3. Group commanders may request a shortfall if they do not have available personnel to
     meet their augmentation duty requirement based on the ARB approved group percentages.
     Shortfalls may be requested when personnel are unavailable due to high deployments or
     contingencies or if fulfilling the requirement will result in severe mission degradation.
        5.3.1. Requests for shortfalls will be staffed through Group Commanders within 5 days
        after the 56 FW/CCC notifies the group coordinators of their ARB tasking. Group
        Commanders will approve shortfall requests in writing before group coordinators send
        shortfall requests to the 56 FW/CCC for coordination to the 56 FW/CV.
        5.3.2. Shortfall requests will be staffed to the 56 FW/CCC through the 56 FW/CV with
        documentation to support the shortfall request and the proposed plan to meet the
        augmentee requirement. The 56 FW/CV is the approval authority for all shortfall
        requests. The 56 FW/CV (or designated representative) will notify the wing
        Augmentation Program Manager and 56 FW/CCC of any changes to an ARB decision.
        The 56 FW/CCC notifies all members, to include 56 SFS/CC, 56 LRS/CC, and AWG
        members of any changes to an ARB decision.
6. 56 SFS (Augmented Unit) Responsibilities.
     6.1. The 56 SFS/CC has operational responsibility for meeting the wing’s augmentation
     requirements. The 56 SFS/CC will manage all SF augmentee training requirements and route
     all requests for additional SF augmentation to the 56 FW/CCC for coordination with the 56
     FW/CV being the final approval authority. Once approved, the 56 SFS/CC will provide the
     Augmentation Program Manager with a copy of the approved request.
     6.2. The 56 SFS/CC will appoint a primary and alternate Augmentation Program coordinator
     to manage all aspects of the SFS Augmentation Program. The SFS coordinator will:
        6.2.1. Maintain a training folder on each SFS augmentee in the wing and ensure an
        augmentee’s training status. Folders will contain individual’s training record (AF Form
        1098, Special Task Certificate and Recurring Training); AF Form 55, Employee Safety
        and Health Record; AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data; Augmentee
        Test; Use of Force Test; and augmentee biography. Maintain augmentee folders for
        training qualification.
        6.2.2. Track and schedule all firing for augmentees.
     6.3. The following is a list of training requirements:
        6.3.1. All SFS augmentees will attend a 5-day initial training session, which includes 1
        day of weapons qualification and 4 days of classroom instruction. This initial training
        will be in accordance with AFI 36-2225, Security Forces Training and Standardization
        Evaluation Program. If an augmentee does not have a current Flight Line Driver’s
        License, 1 additional day of SFS training will be required to obtain license.
        6.3.2. All SFS augmentees are required to attend a 2-day refresher training, which
        includes 1 day of weapons qualification and 1 day of classroom instruction. This annual
        training will be in accordance with AFI 36-2225.
        6.3.3. Each augmentee will possesses a valid security clearance or a favorable interim
        security clearance prior to being selected as an augmentee.
LUKEAFBI10-243 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                                5


   6.4. The use of SFS augmentees in conditions other than increased FPCONs or 56 FW
   requirements must be authorized by the 56 FW/CV.
7. Deployment Machine Responsibilities, POCs: 56 LRS/CC and 56 FW/IDO.
   7.1. The 56 LRS/CC has operational responsibility for meeting the wing’s augmentation
   requirements. The 56 FW/IDO has the responsibilities of identifying and tracking all
   deployment training IAW AFI 10-403 Attachment 5, once the “just in time” training is
   initiated. The IDO will also route all requests for additional deployment augmentation to the
   56 FW/CCC for coordination, with the 56 FW/CV being the final approval authority. Once
   approved, the 56 FW/IDO will provide the Deployment Machine Program Manager with a
   copy of the approved request.
   7.2. The 56 LRS/CC will appoint a primary and alternate Wing Augmentation Duty Program
   Manager to manage all aspects of Deployment Augmentation Program.
8. Wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager Responsibilities.
   8.1. The Wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager is responsible for the overall
   administrative function of the Wing Augmentation Duty Program and ensuring the ARB plan
   is implemented.
   8.2. The program manager will:
      8.2.1. Schedule ARB meetings, as directed by the 56 FW/CV, and notify ARB members
      outlined in 3.1.
      8.2.2. Coordinate, in conjunction with 56 FW/CCC, AWG meetings as needed to review
      procedural guidance and augmentation requirements.
   8.3. The 56 FW/CCC will facilitate AWG meetings. Schedule a prebrief with the 56
   FW/CV to discuss proposed agenda before convening the ARB. Facilitate the board,
   maintain board minutes, and ensure minutes are distributed to ARB members. Send out
   Ready Augmentee Roster semiannually for validation and training status requirements.
9. Manpower Responsibilities.
   9.1. Manpower personnel will perform augmentation requirement and manpower reviews of
   augmented units as requested by the Wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager.
   Augmentation reviews will be used solely to provide demographics of the wing population to
   the AWG and ARB to determine group taskings in accordance with para 9.4.
   9.2. Taskings are based on group manning, AFI exemptions forwarded to the ARB must
   detail the reason for the exemption and the effect nonapproval would have on mission
   impact. Where possible, exemptions will be supported by documentation, such as quotes
   like, “AFI 12-345 directs that AFSC (state AFSC) will not be tasked for augmenting base
   functions.” NOTE: Consider the civilian workforce prior to establishing an exemption. The
   ARB will approve group taskings for augmentees to meet wing mission requirements. Any
   changes to augmentee taskings or group percentages must be authorized by the 56 FW/CV.
   9.3. Any new augmentee taskings proposed through the AWG must be validated by 56
   FSS/FSMM before the proposal is presented to the ARB.
   9.4. The 56 FSS/FSMM will use the following formula to calculate group taskings:
 6                                                     LUKEAFBI10-243 6 DECEMBER 2013


        9.4.1. Group total number of enlisted authorizations – approved exemptions = Group
        Percentage Base total of authorizations after exemptions
        9.4.2. Group Percentage x Base Augmentee Requirement = Group Augmentee Tasking
10. Group Coordinator Responsibilities.
     10.1. Group coordinators will assist Group Commanders in fulfilling their augmentation
     taskings as directed by the ARB or requesting shortfalls in accordance with para 5.3. Group
     coordinators are responsible for managing the daily affairs of their group augmentation
     program. They will maintain a roster identifying group members for augmentation duty.
     The roster will be updated as information changes to ensure it remains current, e.g., new
     members assigned or deleted.
     10.2. Group coordinators may rotate members performing augmentee duties as they see fit to
     meet mission requirements, provided they ensure the moves are properly coordinated and
     members have served a minimum of 60 days (except in emergency situations). Group
     coordinators rotating augmentees must coordinate with the 56 SFS/S3T and 56 FW/IDO
     prior to rotation to ensure the augmentee is qualified.
     10.3. When tasked, group coordinators must provide the 56 SFS/S3T with the names of the
     personnel required to fill group taskings before the SFS augmentee assembly meeting. Due
     to the cost of training SFS augmentees, members will remain as SFS augmentees until
     retirement, separation, PCS, or as otherwise approved by the owning Group Commander.
     10.4. Units must replace augmentees on their rosters 60 days prior to PCS, separation (if
     practicable), retirement, pregnancy (point at which they can no longer be expected to perform
     duties), or any other reason that affects their availability in accordance with para. 11.1.
     When augmentees assigned to the SFS or deployment machine are placed on profile and/or
     quarters for less than 72 hours, the 56 SFS and deployment machine will absorb the shortage
     internally. When activated and an augmentee’s profile and/or quarters exceed 72 hours, the
     owning unit will replace the augmentee.
     10.5. When activated, group coordinators will deconflict augmentee duty with physical
     profile changes, projected leave dates, and TDYs before submitting rosters to 56 SFS/S3T.
11. Squadron Coordinator Responsibilities.
     11.1. Squadron coordinators are responsible for managing the daily affairs of the unit
     Augmentation Duty Program. They will maintain a roster identifying unit members for
     augmentation duty. Personnel will not be selected for augmentation duty if under any
     driving revocation, facing charges for domestic violence, or undergoing any administration
     actions that would keep them from using a fire arm or vehicle. They will screen members to
     ensure all qualifications to perform augmentation duty are met and no eliminating factors
     exist before their rosters are submitted to group coordinators. The roster will be updated as
     information changes to ensure it remains current, e.g., new members assigned or deleted.
     11.2. Squadron coordinators will provide their tasking requirement to group coordinators in
     order to meet the wing suspense. If there is a discrepancy, squadron and group coordinators
     will resolve the issue before the group coordinator notifies SFS or the Wing Augmentation
     Duty Program Manager of any changes.
LUKEAFBI10-243 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                                7


   11.3. Squadron coordinators will ensure SFS augmentees out process with the 56 SFS/S3T
   prior to PCS, separation (if practicable), retirement, pregnancy (point at which they can no
   longer be expected to perform duties), or any other reason that affects their availability in
   accordance with para 11.1. Unit commanders will ensure 56 SFS and 56 FW deployment
   augmentees return all assets to the augmented unit before departing the base.
   11.4. Squadron coordinators will report physical profile changes, projected leave dates, and
   TDYs to their group coordinators.
12. Augmentee Responsibilities.
   12.1. When activated during a general 56 FW recall (ref Luke AFBI 10-201, Pyramid Recall
   system (PRS) and Crisis Action Team Procedures), augmentees assigned to augmentee duty
   will report to their temporary duty location (either the 56 SFS or 56 LRS) for accountability
   and reporting.
   12.2. Augmentees will report physical profile changes, projected leave dates, and TDYs to
   their squadron coordinators.
   12.3. During a DEPLOYEX or real-world contingency, an Augmentation Commander’s
   Staff Directive (CSD) will be sent out (see attachment 5) with notification of activation and
   reporting instructions.
13. Augmentation Procedural Information.
   13.1. Group and squadron commanders will appoint, in writing, a primary and alternate
   Augmentee Coordinator to coordinate all augmentee issues. Appointment letters will be sent
   to the wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager and 56 SFS/S3T on a quarterly basis.
   Letters will be received 2 weeks before each quarter. Letters must be updated and validated
   by group and squadron commanders every time there is a change.
   13.2. All augmentee requirements must be approved by the commander of the augmented
   unit before they are sent to 56 FSS/MO and the Wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager
   for coordination. After 56 FSS/MO validates the augmentee requirements, the AWG will
   establish a plan to support all augmentee requirements. The Wing Augmentation Duty
   Program Manager, accompanied by the 56 FW/CCC and personnel representing the
   augmented unit, will prebrief the 56 FW/CV on all augmentee requirements and the plan
   established by the AWG. The 56 FW/CV will validate the augmentee requirement and
   convene the ARB to finalize the AWG plan, or request the AWG provide additional
   information before the ARB is convened. The Wing Augmentation Duty Program Manager
   is responsible for ensuring the AWG plan is presented to the ARB and approved by 56
   FW/CV before implementation begins.
