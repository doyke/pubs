1. CREDIT HOURS. Credit hours are hours that a civilian employee may voluntarily work,
with supervisory approval, in excess of the employee’s regularly scheduled 80-hour bi-weekly
basic work requirement under a flexible work schedule due to mission requirements.

2. FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE (FWS): A flexible work schedule consists of workdays
with (1) core hours and (2) flexible hours. Core hours are the designated period of the day when
all employees must be at work. Flexible hours are the part of the workday when employees may
(within limits or "bands") choose their time of arrival and departure. Within limits set forth in
this instruction, FWS can enable employees to select and alter their work schedules to better fit
personal needs and help balance work, personal, and family responsibilities.
        2.1. Normal core hours are from 0900 to 1500 with a lunch (or mid-shift break). Duty
        hours may not begin before 0600 nor end after 1800, except where mid or swing shifts
        have been established. Commanders of centers and wings may establish different hours
        for their respective organizations provided offices under their control are open during
        hours that render maximum support and responsiveness to their customers.
3. EARNING AND ACCRUING CREDIT HOURS.
     3.1. Credit hours will be worked only with prior approval of the supervisor. If prior
     approval is not practical, supervisor approval is required as soon as possible after the work
     has been performed.
        3.1.1. Hours that count toward the basic 80-hour bi-weekly work requirement may not be
        considered credit hours.
        3.1.2. Employees are not paid basic pay or overtime pay for credit hours.
        3.1.3. One (1) credit hour is earned for each hour of voluntary work in excess of the
        basic work requirement. Credit hours may only be earned in 30 minute increments; total
        credit hours earned may not exceed 2 hours per day.
        3.1.4. Credit hours are worked at the “election” of the employee. They are distinguished
        from overtime hours in that they are not officially ordered and approved in advance by
        management. Employees may earn credit hours only by working within the flexible time
        bands surrounding core hours. Time earned outside of the established flexitour time band
        are not considered “credit hours” and must be authorized as compensatory time-off or
        paid overtime using an AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay and
        Compensatory Time, and accounted for in accordance with (IAW) Time and Attendance
        governing directives.
        3.1.5. Full-time employees may accumulate not more than 24 credit hours to be carried
        forward for credit against a later pay period. Any credit hours worked in a pay period
        that exceed the 24-hour maximum carryover must be taken during that pay period, or
        they will be forfeited.
        3.1.6. Part-time employees are limited to the credit hours to be carried forward on a pro-
        rated basis. For carry-over purposes, a part-time employee may carry over credit hours
        from one bi-weekly pay period to the subsequent bi-weekly pay period, in an amount
        equal to 25 percent of the bi-weekly scheduled hours of work.
        3.1.7. All earned and used credit hours will be officially recorded on the Credit Hour
        Schedule at Attachment 1 and recorded IAW T&A governing directives. Use the official
        timekeeping code of “CD” to record credit hours earned and “CN” for credit hours used.
        The Credit Hour Schedule will be submitted to the Time Keeper and filed with other
        T&A supporting documentation, as appropriate.
AFISRAI36-801 31 AUGUST 2010                                                                 3


       3.1.8. Employees may earn credit hours on a normally scheduled work day when the
       supervisor has authorized other types of approved absences of a short duration, such as
       sick leave for medical appointments, etc. Employees may earn credit hours on the days
       they participate in supervisory approved physical fitness activities.
       3.1.9. Credit hours may not be earned on holidays or weekends unless those are normally
       scheduled work days.
       3.1.10. Employees excused from their basic work requirement on that day will not earn
       credit hours ( i.e., weather emergency).
       3.1.11. Credit hours may not be earned while in training or temporary duty (TDY) status.
       Compensatory time off for travel is a separate form of “compensatory time” that may be
       earned and accounted IAW governing directives.
4. USE OF CREDIT HOURS.
   4.1. Credit hours may be used in lieu of other types of leave.
   4.2. Credit hours must be earned before they are used.
   4.3. Credit hours may be used during a subsequent day, week, or pay period, with
   supervisory approval.
   4.4. Credit hours cannot be used to create a form of compressed work schedule.
5. UNUSED EARNED CREDIT HOURS.
   5.1. Full-time employees will receive pay for a maximum of 24 unused credit hours at his or
   her current rate of basic pay when Federal employment ends, when the employee transfers to
   another agency or when the employee otherwise is no longer subject to an agency’s flexible
   work schedule program.
       5.1.1. Part-time employee who is no longer subject to an agency’s flexible work
       schedule program receives basic pay for accumulated credit hours that are not in excess
       of the employee’s bi-weekly basic work requirement.
6. ACCOUNTABILITY. It is the responsibility of the supervisor and employee to keep an
accurate accounting of credit hours. Informal accounting of credit hours is not acceptable.
