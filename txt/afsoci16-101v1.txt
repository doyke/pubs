                                             Chapter 1

                                              POLICY

1.1. General. This instruction provides for training management of personnel assigned to,
attached to, or augmenting CAA and Operational Aviation Detachment (OAD) operations. It
also establishes a standardized training program.
     1.1.1. The overall training program establishes procedures to:
        1.1.1.1. Qualify all associated personnel in the mission as combat aviation advisors.
        1.1.1.2. Specify continuation training requirements for all associated AFSCs.
     1.1.2. For the purposes of this instruction, CAA aviators operate aboard three categories of
     aircraft. It is important to distinguish between the categories of aircraft. The Commander,
     Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center (AFSOAWC/CC) will make determination
     if in garrison aircraft fall under additional or supplemental category, and if aircraft specific
     addenda are required.
        1.1.2.1. Standard/Organic Aircraft. Aircraft listed as part of the US Air Force (USAF)
        inventory. The training instructions for these aircraft are listed in the applicable AFI 112
        Mission Design Series (MDS), Vol 1.
        1.1.2.2. Additional Aircraft. Nonstandard aircraft that are not part of the USAF
        inventory, but are flown for the purposes of continuing and maintaining qualification
        and/or certification. The training instructions for these aircraft are normally listed in
        AFSOCI 11-219,Vol 1, Additional Aircraft Training.
        1.1.2.3. Supplemental Aircraft. Nonstandard aircraft which are not part of the USAF
        inventory, and typically used for the purpose of conducting advisory operations. Usually
        not used for maintaining qualification. The training instructions for these aircraft are
        listed in AFSOCI 11219, Vol 1.
     1.1.3. CAA mission qualification training (Chapter 2) establishes required Mission Ready

                                           Chapter 2

       COMBAT AVIATION ADVISOR MISSION QUALIFICATION (CAAMQC)

2.1. Purpose. The CAAMQC was designed to prepare selected members to perform duties as a
combat aviation advisor and deploy as a member of an OAD. The course provides training for
these personnel to gain the skills necessary to operate from austere locations, often without
logistical support through normal DOD channels. A principal objective of this training is to give
US personnel the skills necessary to facilitate the availability, reliability, safety, and
interoperability of Partner Nation (PN) aviation resources to support combined Special
Operations Forces (SOF), either through organic or supplemental aircraft.
   2.1.1. CAAs are aircrew members or other specially trained personnel that accomplish SOF
   Irregular Warfare missions. Examples of other personnel include Security Forces, Crew
   Chiefs; Intelligence Personnel; Logisticians; SERE specialists; AFE specialists; Riggers; and
   International Heath Medics. CAAs serve in squadrons specifically dedicated to the foreign
   internal defense (FID) mission.
   2.1.2. CAA augmenters are other personnel who augment CAA missions but do not receive
   the same level of training. Examples of CAA augmenters include C-145A maintainers
   assigned to the 919 MXS and AFSOAWC and AFSOC members with specialized skills
   necessary for specific irregular warfare missions.
2.2. Scope of Training. Mission qualification training is focused on providing trained
personnel that support the five pillars of irregular warfare (IW): FID, , Counter Terrorism (CT)
Counterinsurgency (COIN), Unconventional Warfare (UW), stability operations (stab ops), as
well as the IW function of Security Force Assistance (SFA).
   2.2.1. Collateral Activities. The mission arena also encompasses such collateral activities as
   advising on aviation support for disaster assistance and humanitarian aid.
2.3. Qualification Training Requirements. Qualification training guidance and requirements
are based on AFDD 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense, AFDD 3-24, Irregular Warfare, JP 3-22,
Foreign Internal Defense, and AFTTP 3-2.76 Multi Service TTP for Advising Foreign Forces.
Training will be accomplished in accordance with AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and
Execution, and this instruction. Initial and recurring training events are listed in Table 2.1.
   2.3.1. The CAAMQC was specifically designed to prepare selected members to perform
   duties as a combat aviation advisor in their specific specialty and deploy as a member of an
   OAD. Specific requirements for the CAAMQC are detailed in the CAA Command Job
   Qualification Standard (CJQS). See Paragraphs 2.6 and 2.7 for the levels of MR skill
   status. The following outlines each phase of training and the time associated with
   completing each phase.
           2.3.2. Language Training Program. Target language proficiency provides an
           indication of ability to succeed in performing the CAA mission and is linked directly
           to readiness. Language skills are highly perishable when not routinely practiced.
           Personnel must be given every possible opportunity to maintain or enhance critical
           language skills.
              2.3.2.1. Language training programs consist of the following:
AFSOCI16-101V1 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            11


               2.3.2.2. Initial Acquisition Training (IAT).
                 2.3.2.3. Category I/II Languages: CAA Airmen assigned to study Spanish,
                 Portuguese-Brazilian, Indonesian, or French will attend language training
                 classes for 85 training days.
                 2.3.2.4 Category III Languages: CAA Airmen assigned to study Russian,
                 Polish, Thai, or Tagalog will attend language training for 125 training days.
                 2.3.2.5. Category IV Languages: CAA Airmen assigned to study Arabic,
                 Persian Farsi, Dari, Pashto, Urdu, or Korean will attend language training
                 for 165 training days.
                 2.3.2.6. IAT includes intensive study to promote rapid retention of
                 vocabulary and grammar. Upon completion of the course, each Airman
                 must complete the OPI and the DLPT.
               2.3.3. Sustainment and Enhancement Training. This training is designed
               to maintain and enhance the language proficiency. Personnel should
               accomplish 80-120 hours of training annually of which no more than 40 hours
               should be self-study (per USSOCOM M350-8). This will be scheduled
               through the ULM. Language Live Environment Training (LET) or immersion
               will meet this requirement.
               2.3.3.1 LET is available to all CAAs who maintain a current DLPT of 1/1 or
               better. For LET in languages other than the one in which the member is
               billeted Sq/CC/ or DO are the approval authority. Language immersion
               should take place in a country in which the assigned language is primary.
               Ideally, the CAA should stay with a host nation family.
           2.3.3.2. The squadron ULM will continually evaluate language programs to
           ensure their effectiveness in supporting mission requirements. Target language
           usage will be integrated in daily training activities, when feasible, and scheduled
           language-training sessions should be conducted in a timely manner with minimum
           interruptions.
           2.3.3.3. The Sq/CC or DO is the approval authority for individual language
           training/LET. The squadron ULM will schedule the training based on mission
           requirements, partner nation practices, and security environment.
     2.3.4. Phase IV - Specialty Developmental Training. Conducted in-unit in the
     individual squadrons.
        2.3.5. Methods of Instructor Course or equivalent. This course is accomplished at
        USAFSOS. The course is geared to increasing the level of learning of USAFSOS
        students by providing instructors who can provide necessary academics in the most
        thought provoking and stimulating manner possible. Course length: 10 days. Note:
        Air Force aircrew personnel are normally not accepted to active-duty CAA units
        without previous instructor experience. Instructor experience is highly desired in all
        other applicable Air Force AFSCs that may be considered for Combat Aviation
        Advisory duties.

2.9. Training Waivers. With the exception of AFI requirements, the operational Sq/CC may
waive advisor qualification requirements; and MR training requirements listed in this chapter.
Waivers for this instruction will be maintained by squadron training in members’ career training
folder. Waivers for MR items should not be approved unless extenuating circumstances prevail
or directed mission dictates.
   2.9.1. Waiver letters should be submitted to the squadron training not later than 30 days
   prior to the deployment.
   2.9.2. Squadron training should route the waiver request through the Sq/Standardization and
   Evaluation, DO and the CC no later than 20 days prior to the deployment.
       2.9.2.1. As a minimum, requests will contain the following information:
           2.9.2.1.1. Name, Rank, Mission number/name of exercise.
           2.9.2.1.2. Brief mission description (including force protection threat and risk
           assessment).
           2.9.2.1.3. Training events not yet accomplished, reason, and expected completion
           date of those events.
           2.9.2.1.4. Impact, if any, of not approving the waiver.
2.10. Augmenter Training.
   2.10.1. Designated Augmenter Training. Augmenters are normally identified in advance,
   provided mission-specific training, and are listed against specific mobility positions.
   Designated augmenters must receive advanced weapons training, advanced medical training,
   defensive driving training, small unit tactics, and tactical force protection training. (T-3)
   2.10.2. Isolation/Spin-Up. All designated augmenters should participate in mandatory
   mission spin-up training and isolation prior to and after missions IAW Vol 3 of this
   instruction. If from outside AFSOC, augmenter orders are to be cut to ensure attendance.
   2.10.3. Non-Designated Augmenter Training. Non-designated augmenters are employed
   when their capabilities are not available or resident within CAA units or AFSOC and their
   participation is required to facilitate mission execution or unit self-training during Joint
   Chiefs of Staff exercises, Joint-Combined Exchange Training (JCET), counter narcotics-
   funded missions, and the like. Non-designated augmenters can deploy as supervised team
   members, but must meet theater and USAF deployment requirements. Additionally, they
   must receive theater/country-specific orientation briefings prior to departure. This briefing
 16                                                  AFSOCI16-101V1 14 NOVEMBER 2013


   will include such issues as, but not limited to, local customs, cultural practices, medical
   considerations, current political/military situations, threats, and military insignia.
   2.10.4. Isolation/Spin-Up. All non-designated augmenters will participate in mandatory
   mission spin-up training and isolation prior to and after missions IAW Vol 3 of this
   instruction. If from outside AFSOC, augmenter orders must be cut to ensure attendance.
2.11. Weapons Qualifications. CAAs conduct operations in a variety of low to critical threat
environments, often at locations where no other US forces are present. The increased likelihood
of contact with a hostile threat or hostile forces at deployed locations makes advanced weapons
skills necessary for CAA personnel. Furthermore, when operating jointly with other US SOF
personnel, CAA operational teams may be required to integrate their firepower in order to
effectively execute force protection. CAA advanced weapons training programs employ a
building-block approach that expands upon the basic fundamentals taught during the Air Force
Qualification Course. Personnel will progress to advanced weapons training once they have
established AF standard proficiency and demonstrated them to CAA security forces personnel.
This approach enhances individual and team weapons proficiency through sound doctrine and
established standards, tactics, techniques, and procedures.
   2.11.1. CAAs are required to maintain qualification in accordance with AFI 31-207, Arming
   and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, Category B, Tables of Standards.
   2.11.2. CAAs will maintain proficiency in Advanced Weapons Training (AWT) Level 3
   objectives, in accordance with AFSOAWC operating instructions.
2.12. Mission Spin-Up Training. Each deploying OAD will enter isolation for a minimum of
one-week prior to mission deployment. During this period of isolation the OAD primary
responsibility will be spin-up training. The OAD mission commander may use this time to
complete team MR requirements and other mission essential training and refreshers. A spin-up
training plan will be presented to the unit DO for review. More information on pre-deployment
spin-up training can be found in Volume 3 of this instruction.
2.13. Quarterly Division Training Requirements. Each war-fighting division or team is
required to conduct a team oriented training event per quarter. This training will be coordinated
through squadron training. The intent of this training period is to aid in establishing team rules
of engagement/tactics, techniques and procedures and develop cohesiveness to foster better
downrange employment. It is highly encouraged that this training take place off-station at a unit
commander approved training location. Include this training into the annual training budget
request.

                                MAINTENANCE TRAINING

4.1. General. Combat Aviation Advisor Maintenance Personnel (CAAMP) are required to
assess, instruct, advise and assist foreign nationals on the employment, sustainment and
operation of a variety of aircraft and equipment, in a tactical environment, and often on aircraft
and equipment that is not in the USAF inventory. The CAA maintenance training program is
designed to prepare an experienced, mature maintenance technician to achieve and maintain the
required level and type of expertise to operate successfully and safely in the maintenance
advisory environment.
   4.1.1. Enlisted maintenance personnel assigned as CAAs interacting with PN personnel must
   hold a minimum of a 7-skill level in their assigned AFSC to include 2A5X1 (fixed-wing
   aircraft general (APG)), 2A5X2 (Helicopter APG), 2A6X1 (propulsion) or 2A3X3 (tactical
   aircraft maintenance). CAAMP must hold a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
   Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) license. The mission requirements/duties are normally
   performed at austere locations where specific MDS/nonstandard aircraft (NSA) support
   capability are not available.
       4.1.1.1. CAAMP will be required to maintain proficiency standards outlined in
       AFSOCI 16101, Vol 1, and AFSOCI 16-101, Vol 3, Combat Aviation Advisory
       Operations. (T-3)
   4.1.2. The CAA maintenance training program has two principal objectives:
       4.1.2.1. Qualify maintenance advisors on the appropriate aircraft and equipment to fulfill
       the squadron’s mission.
       4.1.2.2. Enable maintenance technicians to maintain currency in appropriate technical
       areas.
   4.1.3. Designated Aircraft. The technicians assigned have been selected by AFSC for their
   expertise in their respective career field. Technicians will be required to maintain
   proficiency to the best of their ability depending on aircraft availability in the squadron. The
   technician’s will maintain Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) records in
   accordance with AFI 36-2232, Maintenance Training.
       4.1.3.1. Supplemental Aircraft. CAA technicians licensed as FAA Airframe and
       Powerplant (A&P) mechanics are authorized multiple supplementary aircraft
       qualification. Note: See Chapter 1 for definition of Supplementary Aircraft.
       4.1.3.2. Cross Utilization Training (CUT). Technicians holding an FAA A&P certificate
       may be CUT-trained to accomplish mission requirements with the approval of the
       squadron commander in the organization where maintenance will be performed. CUT
       may be accomplished so the maintainer can assist another fully qualified technician as
       they maintain oversight and overall responsibility for the maintenance accomplished.
       CUT should be accomplished prior to the mission and documented in the technician’s
       Training Business Area (TBA) journal. Qualified technicians can be CUT in the
       following areas:

                           FORCE PROTECTION TRAINING

7.1. General. Force Protection Combat Aviation Advisors (FPCAA) will complete all required
mission readiness training in accordance with this instruction and comply with all training
requirements identified within AFI 36-2646, Security Forces Training and Standardization
Evaluation Programs, and AFSOAWC operating instructions., and have a high level of
competency in all tasks identified in the Force Protection METL.
7.2. Training. Training courses are designed to provide continuation training for skills and
refinement of expertise. All training courses attended by FPCAA must improve METLs,
constitute a training requirement, or fulfill a necessary task for an upcoming OAD deployment.
   7.2.1. FPCAA will attend a minimum of one tactical and one technical training event
   annually. Tactical courses are designed to enhance combat skills while technical courses are
   designed to enhance knowledge in a given subject area. Required courses are listed in Table
   7.1. Recommended, but optional courses are listed in Table 7.2.
   7.2.2. Formal schools are the primary source of training for FPCAA. The secondary source
   is in-unit training using applicable formal school courseware administered by qualified
   FPCAA. Other methods of training may include US governmental agencies, contracted
   security agencies or partner nation on nonstandard tactics, techniques and procedures.
7.3. Nonstandard Weapons Training. The nonstandard weapons training program and
associated weapons and equipment will be maintained by FPCAA or qualified designee. DOD
nonstandard weapons systems are weapons not usually within the FPCAA inventory to include,
but not limited to, the AK-47/AMD-65 assault rifle and variants, FN FAL assault rifle,
GAU 5.56 assault rifle, H&K G3 7.62 assault rifle, FAMAS F1 7.62 assault rifle, CZ-75 pistol,
Makarov pistol, and Browning high power pistol.
   7.3.1. Nonstandard weapons familiarization training will be conducted annually covering the
   period of deployment, with specific instruction on weapons relevant to partner nation
   military inventory. Training should be accomplished through a squadron nonstandard
   weapons training program or an official DOD qualification/familiarization course.
   7.3.2. If the desired specialized weapons courses are unavailable, FPCAA will participate in
   familiarization training with the partner nation country using their weapon system(s). This
   method is not recommended due to the resulting detriment to a FPCAAs credibility with the
   partner nation.
7.4. Documentation. FPCAA will ensure all training, copies of graduation certificates,
diplomas, and certification credentials are maintained in each TBA journal.

                                    LOGISTICS TRAINING

13.1. General. Logistics CAAs are logistic planners and supply personnel and are required to
assess, instruct, advise and assist foreign nationals on the sustainment and support of a variety of
weapons systems and equipment, in a tactical environment, and often on standard and
nonstandard weapons systems and equipment as required in-direct support of OAD teams. The
CAA logistics program is designed to prepare an experienced, mature CAA to achieve and
maintain the required level and type of expertise to operate successfully and safely in the
logistics CAA environment.
   13.1.1. Additional Training Requirements. CAA logistics planners and supply personnel are
   required to comply with the additional training outlined in Table 13.1 to ensure mission
   completion in the direct support of OAD operations.
   13.1.2. Upon completing MR requirements IAW Chapter 2 of this instruction, logistics
   advisors will be considered MR for logistics duties.
13.2. Training Policy:
   13.2.1. Core tasks are tasks the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM) identify as
   minimum qualification requirements for everyone within an Air Force Specialty Code
   regardless of duty position. Additionally, the TBA journal is annotated for enlisted members.
   Core task listing can be found in the master training plan.
   13.2.2. Due to the integral part funding plays within logistics, evaluating a partner nation’s
   logistics capability heavily involves the assessment of FMS cases. DISAM training enables
   the supply personnel to accurately interpret, plan and execute logistics assistance to
   operations without violating federal laws.
   13.2.3. Typically when performing support duties for OADs, logistic planners and supply
   personnel are subjected to higher threat levels amidst supply run times variations and
   location changes for acquisitions of expendables during missions. MR and CE&T training
   alleviate that risk.

                      AIRCREW FLIGHT EQUIPMENT TRAINING

14.1. General. AFE CAAs (CAAAFE) are required to assess, instruct, advise and assist foreign
nationals on the employment, sustainment and operation of life sustaining and emergency egress
equipment, survival items and NVG’s on a variety of aircraft, in a tactical environment, and
often on aircraft and equipment that are not in the USAF inventory. The CAAAFE training
program is designed to prepare an experienced, mature AFE technician to achieve and maintain
the required level and type of expertise to operate successfully and safely.
14.2. AFE Technician Training Policy.
   14.2.1. All AFE technicians are required to stay qualified and proficient at the 7 skill level to
   inspect, maintain, and instruct on both fixed wing and rotary wing equipment. Additionally,
   courses listed in Table 14.1 are required for an AFE technician to be fully mission qualified
   as an AFE CAA. Courses listed in Table 14.2 are recommended for further advancement of
   the AFE CAA skill-set.
14.3. Master Training Plan.
   14.3.1. The AFCFM will identify as minimum qualification requirements for everyone
   within an AFSC regardless of duty position. Core task training for AFE technicians is not
   required if the training capability does not exist in the assigned unit. If the training capability
   resides in another unit at the same base, but not within the same operations group, the
   superintendent and work center supervisors are authorized to waive these core tasks locally
   and must be identified in the unit’s master training plan. Additionally, the TBA journal is
   annotated. Core task listing can be found in the master training plan.
   14.3.2. Duty position tasks are tasks assigned to an individual for the position currently held.
   These include as a minimum all core tasks that correspond with the duty position, tasks
   assigned by the supervisor and tasks outlined in the CAA CJQS.

                                           Chapter 15

                                    TRAINING RECORDS

15.1. General. The primary purpose for maintaining training records is to accurately track and
control unit members’ training, whether it is training on a certain engine type for a maintenance
member, weapons training for a security forces member or primary combat aviation advisor
mission qualification training. Accurate documentation will ensure the member completes
scheduled training in a timely and efficient manner. Accurate documentation also helps
management assess mission capability and readiness. The specific type of training records to be
maintained for each member will be determined by mandated guidance, duty position and AFSC.
   15.1.1. All personnel performing CAA duties will utilize the CAA CJQS for mission
   qualification training regardless of rank, AFSC, or aircrew status in conjunction with an TBA
   journal folder.
       15.1.1.1. IAW AFI 36-2201, supervisors for all enlisted personnel will conduct both an
       Initial Orientation and an Initial Evaluation on personnel 60 days upon arrival to the unit.
       These will be documented and filed in each enlisted Combat Aviation Advisors TBA
       journal unless AFSC specific training records are automated.
       15.1.1.2. The TBA journal is not taken during CAA specific mission deployments due to
       sanitized environment conditions. During these instances records will continue to be
       maintained within the unit training office.
15.2. Non-Aircrew Training Records. All CAAs will have their training accomplished and
documented utilizing the training forms listed in AFI 36-2201.
   15.2.1. Non-USAF Training Documentation. Training records from the provider may be
   used if they fulfill unit requirements. Unit training will retain AF Forms 4109, SOF/CSAR
   Aircrew Training Record, other US training folders, FAA or contract training folders, and PN
   provided training folders for the entire time of the member’s assignment to the unit in the
   member’s CAA/Training Records.
       15.2.1.1. When a unit member receives training in a non-USAF school, the individual
       must provide documentation of training to unit training. This documentation should
       include copies of certificates of training and any other form of documentation received.
           15.2.1.1.1. These copies will then be transferred and/or maintained in the TBA
           journal.
   15.2.2. Supervisory Review Process. Prior to the flight training cycles, flight commanders
   and immediate supervisors should review training folders of personnel under their
   supervision. The unit functional manager of each specific career field is responsible for
   conducting periodic reviews of the training folders of all personnel in that same career field.
15.3. Aircrew Flying Training Records. Aircrew flying training records will be maintained
IAW AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 1, or the AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, series. CAA specific training records
will be maintained IAW AFI 36-2201. Civilian certifications and qualifications will be
annotated on the aircrew members AF Form 4348, IAW 11-202, Vol 2.
AFSOCI16-101V1 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                39


   15.3.1. Supplementary Aircraft. IAW AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 1.
       15.3.1.1. Non-USAF Training Documentation. Training records from the provider may
       be used if they fulfill unit requirements. Unit training will retain AF Forms 4109, other
       US training folders, FAA or contract training folders, and PN provided training folders
       for the entire time of the member’s assignment to the unit in the member’s CAA/Training
       Records.
       15.3.1.2. When a unit member receives training in a non-USAF school, the individual
       must provide documentation of training to unit training. This documentation should
       include copies of certificates of training and any other form of documentation received.
          15.3.1.2.1. These copies will then be transferred to the TBA journal.
   15.3.2. Supervisory Review Process. Flight commanders and immediate supervisors should
   review training folders of personnel under their supervision. The functional manager of a
   specific career field is responsible for conducting periodic reviews of the training folders of
   the personnel in that same career field.
15.4. CAA Training Records. These folders should consist of the following materials:
   15.4.1. TBA journal.
   15.4.2. Career Field Education and Training Plan (enlisted up to TSgt).
   15.4.3. Workcenter JQS/797, Job Qualification Standard (if applicable).

Advising—Advisory assistance (advising), as applied to the CAA mission, is provided to foreign
aviation units, US combatant commands, and other US agencies, and is conducted within the
context of specific times, places, and situations. It includes such product subsets as the
development and use of airpower doctrine; i.e., how to employ airpower (as opposed to how to
operate airplanes), force planning, operational sustainment methods, basing concepts, tactical
employment, and C4 development for specific times, places, and situations.
AFSOCI16-101V1 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 47


Advisory Mission Ready—Combat Aviation Advisors are considered MR after achieving MR
training requirements. Additionally, aircrew members must be mission capable in their primary
aircraft to be MR as a combat aviation advisor.
Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)—An alpha-numeric code which identifies an individual’s
duties.
Aviation Foreign Internal Defense (AvFID or Aviation-FID)—FID is defined in JP 102,
DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, as “participation by civilian and military
agencies of a government in any of the action programs taken by another government to free and
protect their societies from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency.” It is a joint, interagency
activity involving the total political, economic, informational, and military assistance the United
States provides to help host governments deal with internal threats and crises. AvFID focuses on
advisory assistance and training aimed at helping partner nations develop or improve their ability
to employ and sustain aviation resources. Mission specific subjects include air doctrine,
operational planning, command and control, tactics, airbase defense, air-ground operations, and
combat search and rescue.
Augmenter—A person external to the unit who provides a specific skill not organic to the unit.
Coalition Support—Actions taken to facilitate the cooperation, coordination, and integration of
US and foreign military forces during combined operations supporting mutual campaign
objectives. Includes training and advising coalition partners on tactics, techniques, and
procedures promoting combat effectiveness, safety, and interoperability.
Counterinsurgency (COIN)—Those military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological,
and civic actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency.
Designated Augmenter—See Augmenter. A designated augmenter is someone permanently
identified by the wing to provide certain skills not possessed within the unit; such as a
communications specialist, Office of Special Investigations (OSI), IDMT, Physician’s Assistant
(PA), or flight surgeon. These individuals, once identified, will receive specialized training,
which will enable them to deploy with an OAD-A/B.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)—The United States organization responsible for
governing all aspects of United States civil and military aviation.
