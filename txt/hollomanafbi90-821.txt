          interface between contractors and the Air Force with regard to Hazard Communication.
          Contractors are required to train their own personnel according to OSHA Hazard
          Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200. Contractors are responsible for their own
          HAZCOM program.
          2.9.1.2. The Contracting Officer (CO) will ensure a pre-performance conference is available
          for each contract where hazardous materials are involved. At this conference, the CO, with
          assistance from BE and workplace supervisors, if requested, will advise contractors of
          hazardous chemicals that may be encountered during operations at Holloman AFB and the
          protective measures needed during the normal course of their work. The contractor will be
          informed that MSDSs are available through BE and/or Hazardous Materials Management
          (HAZMART) and provide information on the labeling system.
          2.9.1.3. At the pre-performance conference and during the contract performance period, the
          requiring activity Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) government inspector, for contracts
          that require a QAE, will ensure that workplace supervisors and Air Force employees are
          advised of hazardous chemicals introduced by the contractor and any protective measures
          necessary based on these hazards.
          2.9.1.4. The contractor is required to submit information on use of hazardous materials
          according to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.223-3. "Hazardous Material

       contractor introduces to the work area. The QAP provides the data to the work area supervisor
       and to all Air Force employees who may be affected by the hazardous materials introduced into
       the work area. A contractor is required to submit information on hazardous material in
       accordance with FAR, Clause 52.223-3. The QAP ensures contractors remove any unused
       chemicals from the facility upon completion of the project.
    2.10. Laboratories: Laboratories which are covered by AFOSH STD 48-22 are not required to
    establish a written HAZCOM program or maintain a chemical inventory, but the following
    requirements do apply:
       2.10.1. MSDSs received must be maintained.

instruction serves as the workplace written program required under 29 CFR 1910.1200. The following
items are required elements for a shop-level written Hazard Communication Program and will be
maintained together (i.e.: in a 3-ring binder) in a readily accessible location in each work area. Organize
the binder as follows:
   3.1. TAB A - a copy of this instruction.
   3.2. TAB B - a copy of AFI 90-821 or cross-referenced with a local form placed in this tab.
   3.3. TAB C - a copy of the hazardous chemical inventory.
   3.4. TAB D - copies of Bioenvironmental Engineering Survey Reports that must be kept for 10
   years.
   3.5. TAB E - a copy of the MSDS for each hazardous chemical used in the workplace and listed on
   the chemical inventory. Due to the large number of hazardous materials that may be used in a
   workplace, separate binders may need to be used and a local cross-referenced form will be placed in
   this tab.
   3.6. TAB F - a copy of each workerâ€™s AF Form 55 or equivalent. AF Form 55(s) may be
   maintained in a decentralized location (i.e., in individual mobility or training folders) and be cross-
   referenced using a local form that's placed in this tab.
   3.7. TAB G - a copy of the shop-specific hazard communication training plan addressing process
   hazards unique to Holloman AFB.
   3.8. TAB H - a list of all non-routine tasks performed in the work area referencing applicable
   directives or operating instructions.
4. Observance of Guidelines Mandatory. Commanders will ensure conformance with the guidelines
established by this instruction to the maximum extent possible under actual conditions. Seek the
guidance of medical personnel where complete adherence to these principles would significantly

Terms
Administrative Controlsâ€”-Administrative controls are restrictions on worker activities during an
operation or process that has the effect of protecting a worker by limiting the workerâ€™s opportunity for
exposure to hazardous materials. Examples are time limits, rotating duties among several workers, etc.
Authorized Users List (AUL)â€”-A list maintained by HAZMART showing all installation-level work
areas authorized to use specific HAZMAT.
Engineering Controlsâ€”-Engineering controls are devices installed in order to prevent hazardous
chemicals or contaminants from reaching workers who would otherwise be exposed.
HAZMARTâ€”-This is the only entity on the installation authorized to issue government-owned
HAZMAT. HAZMART is a facility located in Bldg 1911 where customers can receive support for
obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMATs are managed and tracked. This is the primary location on
the installation where personnel stock, store, issue, and distribute HAZMAT.
Hazardous Material (HAZMAT)â€”-A substance of any quantity or form that has the potential to affect
human health or the environment. Any chemical that is a physical or health hazard and requires an
MSDS as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, and all Class I and Class II ozone-
depleting substances (ODS). A hazardous chemical is also known as a hazardous material or HAZMAT.
Definitions of specific hazardous substances may be found in 29 CFR 1910.1200, Table Z, Toxic and
Hazardous Substances; hazardous material stock class number and their definitions can be found in
Federal Standard 313C, Table I and Table II.
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)â€”-Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by the
chemical manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health hazards,
routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid procedures, and
control measures of the listed hazardous chemicals. The MSDS shall be prepared to be consistent with
29 CFR 1910.1200(g) requirements.
Nonâ€”Routine Tasks--Included in the normal activities of a work area but are infrequently performed;
for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent, or cleaning up spills; or temporary duties
performed outside an individualâ€™s normal Air Force specialty code or job series.

Personal Protective Equipmentâ€”-Personal protective equipment is an item of apparel or a device
worn by a worker that is used to prevent entry of a hazardous material to the body via the respiratory
tract, mucous membranes, eyes or the skin. Examples are respirators, gloves, boots, aprons, coveralls,
face shields, etc.
Sources of Supply (SOS)â€”-SOS includes all Air Force controlled supply organizations and other SOS
operating on an installation. Other SOS include, but are not limited to, contractor-operated civil
engineer supply store, government-operated civil engineer supply store, base maintenance contractors,
contractor-operated parts store and non appropriated funds.
Work Area/Shopâ€”-A room or defined space in an installation where HAZMAT is produced or used,
and where employees are present.
Workspaceâ€”-Defined as an establishment, job site, or project at one geographical location containing
one or more work areas. Within the Air Force, a workplace includes all work areas within the
boundaries of a base, installation or station. This also includes all geographically separated units,
remote sites, and other non-collocated activities that are supported by the host base.

Written Hazard Communication Program--A written Hazard Communication Program is a typed
document prepared for each work area that informs workers about the work areaâ€™s Hazard
Communication Program. Mandatory attachments include a work area hazardous chemical inventory,
the listing of non-routine tasks for the work area, and a copy of AFI 90-821.
