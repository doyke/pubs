SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Removed all references to the MMLS, Communications Focal Point (314 CS/SCOS). Added
references Airfield Systems (19CS/SCOA).
1. Responsibilities:
   1.1. The 19th Communications Squadron Commander (19 CS/CC) will ensure
   communications electronic equipment restoral actions are based upon user-defined priorities.
   1.2. The Airfield Systems (19 CS/SCOA) Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)
   monitor will:
2                                                  LITTLEROCKAFBI33-103 8 MAY 2012


    1.2.1. Assign priorities as established by this instruction.
    1.2.2. Assign job control numbers (JCNs) per governing directive, Maintenance
    Operating Instruction (MOI) 21-1, Assignment of Job Control Numbers, to all
    discrepancies that change equipment or mission status and notify the user of the assigned
    job control number. Each different and subsequent discrepancy requires a unique JCN.
    1.2.3. Control all associated maintenance actions including those requiring joint
    dispatches of multiple work centers.
    1.2.4. Keep the user informed of any changes in status of the JCN, such as backorder of
    Mission Incapable Parts (MICAP), excessive delays in maintenance, etc.
    1.2.5. Verify data or current status with the user on all JCNs associated with the user
    whenever requested. 19 CS/SCOA will verify outages with the primary Air Traffic
    Control and Landing System (ATCALS) facility whenever requested.
    1.2.6. Close JCNs only when the user is satisfied the discrepancy is corrected. A new
    JCN shall be opened for any different discrepancy found during the operational check for
    a previous discrepancy.
    1.2.7. Dispatch maintenance according to the response times stated in this instruction.
    1.2.8. Coordinate/direct maintenance on deferred jobs to meet the response times
    established by this instruction. Jobs with an expired estimated time in commission
    (ETIC) and those awaiting maintenance will be coordinated with work sections for
    prompt rescheduling.
    1.2.9. Monitor all priority jobs. This includes Equipment Inoperative for Parts (EIP),
    contractor and Civil Engineering jobs affecting communications equipment.
    1.2.10. Verify and review AF Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) equivalent
    for all priority parts in accordance with (IAW) AFI 21-116, Maintenance Management of
    Communications-Electronics. Priority A and MICAP parts will be verified daily and all
    Urgency of Need Designator (UND) “B” requests will be verified weekly at a minimum.
    This includes documentation of information and coordination with work sections for
    status updates.
    1.2.11. Control deferred Periodic Maintenance Inspections (PMI) to include notifying the
    19 CS Operations Flight Commander/Chief of Maintenance (COM) and rescheduling.
    1.2.12. Monitor a current automated listing of all on call technicians, provided by
    individual work centers.
    1.2.13. Coordinate with the 19 OSS/OSA or designated representative prior to
    authorizing any maintenance tests of equipment.
    1.2.14. Coordinate with 19 OSS/OSA for downtime other than published times as

     priority outages will be briefed in the current document or other status briefing the next
     duty day.
     1.2.16. Prepare, update, and post the current status document each duty day.
     1.2.17. Disseminate dangerous weather notifications to applicable 19 CS work centers as
     required.
     1.2.18. Perform all duties as prescribed in 00-33A-1001 or assigned by the 19 CS/CC.
     1.2.19. Coordinate with the 19 OSS/OSW or designated representative prior to

     1.3.2. Inform 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor when parts are ordered or received.
     1.3.3. Inform 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor of status changes, estimated time return to
     operation (ETRO) changes and/or delays as they happen. These will include scheduled
     preventive maintenance downtime and generator run-ups or any other actions affecting or
     that could be expected to affect equipment or mission status.
     1.3.4. Inform 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor of PMI reschedule dates.
     1.3.5. Maintain an on-call schedule.
     1.3.6. Be able to coordinate equipment restoral actions within 15 minutes of notification

     1.3.8. Advise the user and 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor when required maintenance is
     accomplished and request the appropriate equipment checks.
     1.3.9. Advise 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor of the fix actions within 30 minutes of
     restoral.
     1.3.10. Coordinate with user and perform PMIs IAW the no-NOTAM schedule in the
     Instrument Flight Rules Enroute Supplement.
     1.3.11. Perform evacuation alarms checks during published PMI times. Coordinate with
     user (Tower Watch Supervisor), if checks will be performed outside these times.
  1.4. Users of the communications equipment listed in this instruction will:
     1.4.1. Notify 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor (501-515-9500) of any equipment outages or
     problems.
     1.4.2. Notify 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor upon restoral of equipment to operational
     status. Users opening a work order must close the work order. 19 CS/SCOA IMDS
     monitor will call the user to close work orders if the user fails to call within a reasonable
     time.

2. Primary ATCALS Monitoring Facilities.
     2.1. The following are designated Little Rock Air Force Base’s primary monitoring
     facilities:
        2.1.1. Little Rock AFB Tower is designated the primary ATCALS equipment monitoring
        facility. The tower is responsible for notifying the NOTAM Dispatch Center (Airfield
        Management) when there is an interruption to, or malfunction in, any NOTAM-
        reportable equipment in the tower or airfield facilities.
        2.1.2. The base weather station, building 120, is the primary monitoring facility for
        weather equipment.
3. General.
     3.1. Assignment and application of dispatch response criteria and restoral priorities for
     specific equipment or systems cannot always be determined from a list of priority
     assignments. Consequently, the following must be considered in applying maintenance
     priorities.
        3.1.1. Mission requirements.
        3.1.2. Priority of work in progress.
        3.1.3. Availability and qualification of work force.
        3.1.4. Safe operation of the system and personnel safety.
        3.1.5. Desirability of restoring alternate equipment when the primary equipment would
        take longer to restore.
     3.2. Maintenance priority designators are used to determine mission response times.
     Numbers 1 through 5 will be used to designate the mission priority. Attachment 2 is the
     suggested priority applications and contains Response Times/Suggested Supply Priority.
        3.2.1. Outage - Equipment/System is unable to support mission requirement. (Not
        Mission Capable) (RED)
            3.2.1.1. Any equipment/system called out as “not mission capable,” “red,” or
            “unusable” constitutes a release of the equipment/system to maintenance.
            Maintenance personnel do not have to further coordinate any release of the
            equipment/system.
            3.2.1.2. Impairment - equipment/system is deteriorated so that total equipment
            operability is diminished but can meet minimum mission requirements. (Partially
            Mission Capable)(AMBER)
            3.2.1.3. Equipment impairments require coordinated downtime. Work sections will
            coordinate the needed downtime through 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor as soon as
            possible. Response will be ASAP after downtime has been tentatively scheduled.
4. Weather Conditions may Affect Response and Restoral/Repair Times.
     4.1. Exceptions to the priority response times in Attachment 2 - These priority response
     times exceptions must be approved by the equipment operator (i.e., ATC Tower, WCP, Base
LITTLEROCKAFBI33-103 8 MAY 2012                                                        5


   Weather, etc.). This deviation will be entered into the 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor Master
   Station Log.
5. Multiple Outage Restoral: 19 CS/SCOA IMDS monitor will direct restoral. The
Communications Squadron Commander will take action IAW T.O. 00-25-108, Communication-
Electronics (C-E) Depot Support, T.O. 00-33A-1001, and this instruction.
