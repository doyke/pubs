   Post) or off base facility managers to ensure base or facility personnel are aware of
   operations being conducted.
   10.2. During any exercise, it is imperative that all personnel understand they can and must
   stop any operation that appears to be unsafe. If any member identifies an unsafe situation
   they will stop operations and contact the nearest supervisor or ETL to brief the situation. The
   situation must be cleared before operations can be continued.
   10.3. In the event of an injury, or catastrophic event, the individual nearest to the event will
   use any communication available and disseminate the following phrase over LMR, Cell or
   Voice: “LIFE SAVER, LIFE SAVER, LIFE SAVER.” Once this phrase is heard over the net
   or other form of communication, all personnel will stop operations immediately. Designated
   medical and litter teams will determine location of injury and respond immediately to
   provide Self Aid Buddy Care (SABC).
   10.4. The following is a list of emergency numbers. This is not an all inclusive list. It is the

     11.1.4. Users are directly responsible for the control of ammunition issued to them for
     any purpose. Accountability of assets, to include expenditures, will be validated upon
     issue and turn-in of the assets at the beginning and end of each shift or whenever required
     to eliminate a discrepancy.
     11.1.5. Personnel using blank ammunition must be familiar with all safety requirements
     and have a working knowledge of the weapon. They must be able to distinguish between
     live and blank ammunition. The unit must provide training to emphasize safe handling,
     weapon operation, use of blank and operator maintenance. This training must be
     documented on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training or AF
     Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/ Command JQS.
  11.2. Issue.
     11.2.1. A Combat Arms official or trained and qualified exercise supervisor designated
     by the Commander will issue blank munitions for use in field exercises.
     11.2.2. A Combat Arms official or trained and qualified person designated by the
     Squadron Commander will only issue munitions to a Supervisor or Team Leader via AF
     Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, for the container of blanks. Prior to the Supervisor
     or Team Leader issuing blank munitions to their personnel, they will inspect every
     weapon to ensure they are in proper working order.
     11.2.3. All AF Form 1297s will be maintained for a period of 90 days from date of
     exercise by the squadron supply representative.
