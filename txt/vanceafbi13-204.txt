                                             Chapter 1

                        AIRFIELD AND AIRSPACE INFORMATION

1.1. Vance AFB Airfield Information. The airfield is defined as all areas west of the aircraft
parking ramp (i.e., runways, and areas in between taxiways and perimeter road). Vance AFB
airfield operating hours are published in the IFR Supplement. Changes and other than normal
airfield hours are sent as a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).
1.2. Runways/Taxiways. The Vance airfield diagram (Attachment 2) depicts runway/taxiway
designations, runway lengths, widths, surface types, field elevation/gradients, Instrument
Landing System (ILS) critical areas and instrument hold lines. Runways 17C/35C are the only
precision instrument runways. All taxiways are 75 feet wide with the exception of taxiway D
between runway 17C/35C and 17L/35R which is 50 feet wide. Portions of the parallel taxi lane
are not visible from the Tower. Tower cannot allow aircraft to taxi until after AM opens and
releases the airfield to the Tower.
     1.2.1. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. Runways 13/31, 04/22 and
     taxiway Delta west of runway 17C/35C are permanently closed to aircraft operations.
     Vehicular traffic may use these surfaces. There are stop bars painted on each closed runway
     100 feet from an active runway, and there are stop signs on each end of the painted stop bars.
     These surfaces are not swept or maintained.
     1.2.2. Intersection Departures. Aircraft may depart from the following intersections:
     runway 35L at taxiway F, runway 35C at taxiway D, runway 17C taxiways C and D.
     Distances remaining from intersections are noted on airfield diagram (Attachment 2).
     1.2.3. Aircraft Taxi Route Restrictions. Taxiway D between runway 17L/35R and 17C/35C
     is unusable between sunset and sunrise or when the visibility is reported as less that 1 mile
     due to lack of taxiway lights. Prior to the arrival or departure of a large/heavy transient
     aircraft, Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) determines aircraft’s taxi routes based
     on its weight/wing span to include taxiway Charlie between the center and outside runway
     due to asphalt pavement. AMOPS coordinates this route with the Tower. The parallel taxi
     lane is restricted to aircraft with a wing span of 82 feet or less. Aircraft with a wing span of
     82 feet to 102 feet require wing walkers along the east side of the taxilane. Aircraft with a
     wing span greater than 102 feet cannot use the taxi lane.
     1.2.4. Only locally assigned T-6, T-38, and T-1 aircraft will utilize Taxiway F east of
     runway 17C/35C when runway 17L/35R is in use. All other aircraft shall utilize Taxiway E
     unless prior coordinated with Tower.
     1.2.5. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA for Vance is all active runways,
     overruns, taxiway Bravo, and that area within 100 feet of any runway edge and overrun. The
     CMA for Kegelman auxiliary is the runway, overruns, and that area within 100 feet of the
     runway edge and overrun. Aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians require approval from the
     controlling agency to enter the CMA. Continuous two-way radio contact must be maintained
     while operating in the CMA until exiting the CMA.
     1.2.6. If radio contact is lost, personnel/equipment/vehicles shall exit the CMA by the most
     direct route (NOT crossing the runway), remain a safe distance outside the CMA, and watch
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                       9


   Tower for light gun signals. Personnel should be extremely alert for on-going aircraft
   operations. Tower shall flash runway/taxiway lights to alert personnel to exit the CMA in an
   emergency situation. Personnel should advise Tower via landline (213-5188) when outside
   the CMA.
1.3. Parking Plan/Restrictions. The parking ramp is designed for routine parking of the T-38
(rows 1 thru 9), T-1 (rows 10 thru 13 and 15-17) and T-6 aircraft (rows 18 thru 31). Row 14,
located in front of Base Operations is for DV parking and transient aircraft. The ramp on the
southeastern portion of the airfield (for over-flow parking of local aircraft, transient aircraft and
air show/open house aircraft) is called the “Pea Patch.”
   1.3.1. T-38 parking spots on row 3 spot D, row 4 Spot E, row 5 spot D, row 6 spot E and
   row 7 spot D are for “sheltering” local T-38s only. At these locations aircraft must be towed
   in and out and not taxied.
1.4. Aircraft Special Operations Areas/Ramps. Hot Brakes, Arm/De-arm and Hydrazine
areas are depicted on the airfield diagram. (Attachment 2).
   1.4.1. Hot Brake Procedures. Aircraft experiencing hot brakes will proceed to a hot brake
   area. These are located in the holding area at the approach end of each of the parallel
   runways.
   1.4.2. Hot Armament/Hung Ordnance Procedures. Vance assigned aircraft do not carry
   ordnance. If notified of a transient arrival with hot armament/hung ordnance, Tower shall
   activate the primary crash phone relaying the aircraft call sign, type aircraft, type of
   armament, estimated time of arrival, and landing runway.               Aircraft carrying hot
   armament/hung ordnance will land on runway 17C/35C or 17R/35L and will be parked on
   runway 35L hammerhead on a 200 degree heading. All turns will be to the west to prevent
   aiming the aircraft towards the base area. Once the aircraft is parked, runway 17R/35L shall
   be closed.
1.5. Vance Tower Class D Airspace with Class E Extension (Attachment 3). Vance Class D
surface area is within 5.1 nautical mile (NM) radius of Vance, with a Class E extension to 6.1
NM to the south. Both Class D area and E extension is from the surface up to and including
3,800 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). The area does not extend east of longitude W 097º 51’ 01” to
ensure that it does not overlap Enid/Woodring’s Class D surface area. The Vance Class D is in
effect during airfield operating hours it becomes Class E when the airfield is closed.
   1.5.1. Delegation of Runway and Pattern Responsibilities to RSUs (Eastside and Shoehorn).
   When all three runways are open, the Tower delegates runway and pattern responsibilities to
   RSUs, when requested, for runways 17L/35R and 17R/35L.
   1.5.2. Vance Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Training Area for Tower/RSU Operations. The T-6
   pattern is flown east of the airfield, RAPCON protects below 5,000 feet MSL. The T-1/T-38
   pattern is flown west of the airfield, RAPCON protects below 5,000 feet MSL. Areas are
   depicted in Attachment 3.
1.6. Aircraft Priorities. Aircraft priorities are applied IAW General Flight Rules and FAA JO
7110.65.
   1.6.1. Vance local aircraft priorities are:

3). The WDG Class D surface area with Class E extensions is from the surface up to and
including 3,800 feet MSL. Vance T-6 and T-1 operations at WDG are conducted IAW 71
FTW/WDG Tower LOA.
1.8. Kegelman Auxiliary Airfield Runways/Taxiways. The Kegelman Airfield diagram
(Attachment 7) depicts runway and taxiway designations, and field elevation. Kegelman is a
daytime, VFR airfield for Vance aircraft only. RSUs use the fire net to communicate with
vehicles and to approve/disapprove entry into the CMA.
   1.8.1. Airfield Checks at Kegelman. The CE Grounds Specialist assigned at Kegelman, or a
   Kegelman fireman, conduct an opening airfield check. Any discrepancies found during the
   check are documented on the Kegelman check form, M1 Form 103, and reported to AMOPs.
   AMOPs documents the discrepancy in the outage database and reports it to the appropriate
   agency for repair. AFM or the AAFM conducts an airfield inspection of Kegelman once
   each month.
   1.8.2. The CE Grounds Specialist and Kegelman firemen are trained and certified by the
   AFM or AAFM IAW AFI 13-204 v3 para 3.1.4.2 standards prior to conducting Kegelman
   airfield checks. Training is documented and tracked in QMIS.
   1.8.3. Aircraft Diverts to Kegelman. Vance aircraft may use Kegelman as an emergency
   divert airfield.
1.9. Lost Communication Instructions. Lost communications will be conducted IAW FAA

                                            Chapter 2

                       CONTROL TOWER FLYING OPERATIONS

2.1. Vehicle Runway Crossing Procedures. Vehicles that are not responding to emergencies
are expected to use the perimeter or access roads around the airfield instead of crossing runways.
If crossing is needed when Tower is controlling the runway, after receiving a request to cross a
runway, Tower shall state: “(call sign) CROSS/PROCEED ON RUNWAY (number) AT
(point/intersection).” or “(call sign) HOLD SHORT OF THE RUNWAY.” Vehicle operators are
required to read back hold instructions.
2.2. Vance Tower VFR Pattern Procedures. Tower controllers apply FAA JO 7110.65 VFR
pattern and phraseology rules. Local aircraft in the VFR patterns should squawk 4301. Aircraft
under Tower or RSU control use established traffic patterns (Attachments 7, 8, 9, 10).
Helicopter operations are conducted IAW FAA JO 7110.65 Chapter 3, section 11.
   2.2.1. VFR Pattern Weather Minimums. Cloud ceiling listed in the official weather
   observation must be at least 500 feet above the pattern altitude for the type of pattern
   requested. Additionally, Tower must be able to maintain visual contact with the aircraft
   throughout the pattern
   2.2.2. Vance assigned aircraft operating under Tower control in the VFR pattern will adhere
   to the following procedures. These procedures differ from RSU controlled pattern
   procedures and must be fully understood by all Vance student and instructor pilots. RSU
   operations are preventive control while Tower maintains positive control. Pilots are not
   automatically cleared to maneuver (i.e. turn crosswind) unless directed/approved by Tower.
   Maneuvering for safety of flight (i.e. breakout) always takes precedence.
   2.2.3. Tower only recognizes the closed pull-up to the perch as the traffic pattern. All other
   ground tracks around the Tower airspace are used to get the aircraft back into the traffic
   pattern. Aircraft under Tower control will continue to use normal ground tracks to return to
   initial, VFR entry, or when flying straight-ins.
   2.2.4. All Vance assigned aircraft should continue to make all normal pattern position
   reports but Tower may not respond. These calls will enhance pilot situational awareness
   during periods of increased traffic.
   2.2.5. On initial takeoff or touch-and-go, when remaining in the pattern, aircrew will have
   four choices of pattern requests.
       2.2.5.1. "Call sign, request closed" - normal closed pattern; initiate at departure end of
       the runway unless specifically cleared (i.e. present position).
       2.2.5.2. "Call Sign, request initial" - fly outside downwind and report initial.
       2.2.5.3. "Call Sign, request straight-in" - fly outside downwind and straight-in ground
       track.
       2.2.5.4. "Call Sign, request flight rejoin" (T-38 only) - fly Shoehorn Option ground track,
       rejoin, enter through VFR entry and request straight-in, formation landing, full stop.
 12                                                        VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013


   2.2.6. Aircraft shall not go around directly over another aircraft on the runway. If another
   aircraft is on the runway, offset towards the traffic pattern at/below 2300' MSL for the
   outside runway, at/below 1800' MSL for the inside runway. If there is a conflict between a
   final turn and a straight-in, the straight-in aircraft will yield and offset away from the
   conflict.
   2.2.7. On initial takeoff or touch-and-go, if no clearance is received by 5 DME, depart the
   airspace and report re-entering at VFR entry (Attachments 8, 9, 10). If breaking out, use
   normal calls. Tower will expect the pilot to report VFR entry.
   2.2.8. Crews desiring to depart to radar will make the request between 9 and 4 mile straight-
   in (T-38/T-1), 5 and 2 mile straight-in (T-6) or NLT the perch.
   2.2.9. T-6 entries from Woodring are approved, and Tower will expect crews to report VFR
   entry. T-6 crews may request high key from initial or low key from departure leg.
   2.2.10. Protection of the Overhead Pattern. When the overhead pattern to runways 17C/35C
   or 17R/35L is in use, all aircraft will maintain at or below 2,300 feet MSL until departure end
   of runway. When the overhead pattern to runway 17L/35R is in use, all aircraft will maintain
   at or below 1,800 feet MSL until departure end of runway. Tower will issue the restriction to
   all transient aircraft.
   2.2.11. Noise Abatement. Due to noise abatement concerns, aircraft will not overfly Vance
   housing during low closed patterns.
   2.2.12. Pattern Checks. Tower shall coordinate with RAPCON prior to conducting pattern
   checks. Tower will not conduct pattern checks to runway 17L/35R simultaneously with
   VOR or Global Positioning System (GPS) approaches to runway 17L/35R, or VOR/TACAN
   approaches to runway 17C/35C. Tower will not conduct pattern checks to runway 17R/35L
   simultaneously with VOR/TACAN or GPS approaches to runway 17R/35L.
   2.2.13. Tower VFR Pattern Priorities. Tower controlled VFR pattern local priorities exist to
   maximize safety/training:
       2.2.13.1. Emergencies
       2.2.13.2. Transient aircraft
       2.2.13.3. Aircraft established in the pattern
       2.2.13.4. Aircraft entering from radar or VFR entry point
       2.2.13.5. Aircraft on VFR entry leg
2.3. Split to Land Procedures. A split to land maneuver is when a formation is on an
instrument approach or VFR straight-in to runway 17C/35C or 17R/35L and one aircraft lands on
the runway 17/35C and the other aircraft on runway 17R/35L. Approval for a split to land is not
clearance to perform a 360 degree circle.
2.4. Go-Around. This option is for aircraft on final and will be utilized only inside 4 DME. The
following procedures will be utilized:
   2.4.1. Aircraft on runway 17L/35R will offset to the east.
   2.4.2. Aircraft on runway 17C/35C and 17R/35L will offset to the west.
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                         13


2.5. Breakout (Instrument Approaches). This option is for aircraft on final and will be
utilized only outside 4 DME.        The call, “(call sign), FLY RUNWAY HEADING,
CLIMB/MAINTAIN 4,000 FEET, (traffic)” will be made on the primary frequency. If on Tower
frequency, Tower shall immediately notify RAPCON of the breakout.
2.6. Tower Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Procedures. Tower may apply
RSRS between Vance assigned aircraft IAW Attachment 23.

                                           Chapter 3

                               DEPARTURE PROCEDURES

3.1. Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft
(MARSA). MARSA is approved between Vance assigned aircraft departing off parallel
runways, while on a departure procedure/stereo route/parallel or diverging courses. If a
controller issues instructions to take an aircraft off a departure procedure or parallel courses,
MARSA no longer applies, and the controller becomes responsible for standard separation unless
the instruction creates diverging courses. MARSA is applied out to 10 DME from END, FL 240
and below. When runway 35 is in use, weather minimums required to use this application of
MARSA are 500 foot ceiling and 4 miles visibility. When runway 17 is in use, weather
minimums required to use this application of MARSA are 600 foot ceiling and 4 miles visibility.
MARSA does not apply for successive same runway departures. MARSA does not apply to
transient departures.
3.2. Local Aircraft Departing Runway Supervisory Unit (RSU) Controlled Runways.
   3.2.1. All aircraft departing an RSU controlled runway are VFR until receiving a control
   instruction from RAPCON. Radio and radar contact in itself does not constitute IFR. The
   control instruction can be a heading and altitude, clearance on course or a stereo route, etc.
3.3. T-6 IFR Departures.
   3.3.1. When the T-6 status is Restricted Pattern (RP) or better: Clearance Delivery will read
   the IFR clearance as written, omitting the Vance 1 and any stereo routes. Then add to the
   clearance “On departure, track heading 169 (RWY 17)/359 (RWY 35) and maintain VFR,
   expect IFR pickup 3 minutes after departure.”…rest of clearance.
   3.3.2. When the T-6 status is Button Hook (BH) or worse: Clearance Delivery will issue the
   Vance 1, radar vectors to all departing T-6s.
3.4. Eastside Operations.
   3.4.1. Under normal operations (17L/35R), aircraft departing runway 17L/35R will fly the
   VFR ground track.
   3.4.2. VFR Departure Spacing. Eastside RSU provides the following spacing for Vance T-
   6s departing off runway 17L/35R:
       3.4.2.1. Single ship following a single ship – 60 seconds / 3 miles
       3.4.2.2. Single ship following a formation – 75 seconds / 4 miles
       3.4.2.3. Formation following a formation – 90 seconds / 5 miles
   3.4.3. Insufficient Spacing. If spacing is insufficient, RAPCON will direct the aircraft to
   maintain VFR and return to the VFR pattern.
3.5. Shoehorn Operations.
   3.5.1. Under normal operations (17R/35L), Shoehorn will request release from the Tower for
   departures. Coordination shall be accomplished at the following locations in the pattern.
   Tower is responsible for departure separation.
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                              15


      3.5.1.1. Straight-ins: 9 miles and 4 miles.
      3.5.1.2. Overheads: 4 mile initial and downwind.
      3.5.1.3. If there are no arrival/departure conflicts, the aircraft will be released.
   3.5.2. If Tower cannot grant a release, Tower will say “HOLD FOR RELEASE, call me at
   (point in pattern/on final)”. If Tower is unable to release the aircraft on their first approach,
   aircraft will make one additional pattern and Shoehorn will again request IAW paragraph
   3.5.1.
   3.5.3. If release cannot be granted after the additional pattern and the aircraft cannot be
   further delayed in the pattern, Shoehorn shall notify RAPCON the aircraft will be Jailbreak
   (Attachment 11).
3.6. Other than Three Runway Operations.
   3.6.1. During times of single runway operations for T-1/T-38s with runways 17C/35C or
   17R/35L closed, Shoehorn will obtain automatic releases from RAPCON when Shoehorn is
   the controlling agency, with the following conditions:
      3.6.1.1. Vance 1 (Local Climb Out) following Vance 1 (Local Climb Out) ----------------1
      minute
      3.6.1.2. FCF Departures -------------------------------------------------------------- RAPCON
      Approval
      3.6.1.3. VANCE 1 (Local Climb Out) following FCF -----------------------------------------1

      minutes
      3.6.1.5. Tinker/Will Rogers following Tinker/Will Rogers                   (Jayhawk 2 following
      Jayhawk 2)------------------------------------------------------ 2 minutes
      3.6.1.6. Low-level (IR Route) following low-level (IR Route) (same route) -------------10
      minutes
      3.6.1.7. Any T-38 departure following a dissimilar aircraft--------------------- RAPCON
      Approval
      3.6.1.8. All others -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      1 minute
   3.6.2. Any time RAPCON cancels automatic releases, the RSU must reacquire automatic
   releases from RAPCON prior to launching anymore aircraft unless an individual release is
   obtained from RAPCON.
   3.6.3. During a runway closure, only Vance assigned aircraft may conduct an approach to a
   closed runway. All approaches will terminate as a restricted low approach or normal low
   approach. Tower is approval authority.
3.7. Departure Separation Using Automatic Releases with Tower Controlling. Local
departure releases, separation and coordination are Tower’s responsibility.
 16                                                        VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013


3.8. Departures during VORTAC Outages. During VORTAC outages, RAPCON should
continue to issue local departure procedures, local stereo routes, and published instrument
departures to T-6 aircraft. RAPCON shall issue T-38s and T-1s alternate departure instructions.
   3.8.1. Issue T-38s and T-1s either Vance 1 departure with radar vectors or Local Climb out.
   3.8.2. Expect T-1s to file one of the following off-station fixes, based on destination/route of
   flight:
       3.8.2.1. North (ANY)
       3.8.2.2. South (IFI)
       3.8.2.3. East (ALCOR)
       3.8.2.4. West (MMB)
   3.8.3. Clearance Delivery will use the following phraseology for issuing clearances to T-38s
   and T-1s. “(call sign), CLEARED TO (destination), VIA VANCE 1 DEPARTURE/LOCAL
   CLIMBOUT, RADAR VECTORS (fix) (rest of clearance)”
3.9. Vance IFR Local Climb Out from Runway 17C/35C and 17R/35L. When issued local
climb out, Vance aircraft departing from runway 17C/35C or 17R/35L will comply with the
tracks/headings/altitudes as shown in Attachment 14.
3.10. Non-Standard Formation Departures. Aircraft departing non-standard shall advise
ground control of their intentions. The wingman will squawk 0100. Controllers will apply non-
standard formation separation IAW FAA prescribed minima.
3.11. Opposite Direction Operations. Opposite direction aircraft operations are not normally
conducted at Vance due to volume of traffic and student pilot training. Tower is the final
approving authority for opposite direction arrivals. RAPCON is the final approving authority for
opposite direction departures. If opposite direction operations will be conducted, they shall be
coordinated IAW FAA JO 7110.65 with the following local restrictions:
   3.11.1. Tower must be in control of all runways.
   3.11.2. IFR arrivals shall not proceed closer than 15 flying miles from the runway until the
   opposite direction IFR arrival has crossed the landing threshold.
   3.11.3. IFR departures shall not be placed in takeoff position or cleared for take-off when an
   IFR arrival to the opposite runway is within 15 flying miles of the runway.
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                 17


                                          Chapter 4

MOAS / AIR REFUELING ROUTES (ARS) / MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES (MTRS)
            / FUNCTIONAL CHECK FLIGHT PROCEDURES (FCFS)

4.1. Military Operations Area (MOA) Procedures. Vance aircraft are the primary users of
Vance MOAs. Attachment 17 depicts the lateral/vertical limits of these areas. RAPCON cannot
approve extensions above/below MOA charted altitudes. The following paragraphs clarify
services provided to 71 FTW assigned aircraft operating in Vance 1A/1B/1C/1D
MOAs/ATCAA. Based on workload, RAPCON provides VFR traffic information to
participating aircraft.
   4.1.1. All 71 FTW assigned aircraft are provided radar IFR service to and from the Vance
   1A/1B/1C/1D MOAs/ATCAA to the maximum extent possible IAW FAAO JO 7610.4.
   4.1.2. All 71 FTW assigned aircraft operating within and transiting the confines of the Vance
   1A/1B/1C/1D MOAs/ATCAA are considered participating aircraft, and are provided
   merging target procedures IAW FAAO JO 7610.4 paragraphs 12-10-4 and 12-10-11d.
4.2. Altimeter Setting For MOA Operations. Vance aircraft will use local altimeter setting
while established in the AR-60, AR-70, and Vance MOAs or overlying ATCAA. When Vance
altimeter drops below 29.92, the upper limits of the ATCAA and AR High routes are reduced by
1,000 feet.
4.3. MOA Usage during Vance VORTAC Outages. Vance aircraft are equipped with
navigational equipment that allows their continued use of the MOAs despite Vance VORTAC
outages.
4.4. Vance 1 B MOA/ATCAA (Northern and Eastern MOAs) (Attachment 17). T-6s
normally use eastern high areas for instrument missions, eastern low areas for formation
missions, northern low areas for contact missions, and northern high areas for contact spin
missions. T-6 formations normally are assigned areas 9 and 10 together. If formation missions
use a northern area they normally need two adjacent areas (except for area 4).
4.5. Vance 1 A, C, D MOA/ATCAA (Western MOAs) (Attachment 17). Formation T-38s
use middle/outer ring areas or two adjacent inner ring areas. T-1s use low (10,000 - 14,000) and
high blocks (16,000 – 20,000 MSL). To the maximum extent possible, T-1s are assigned areas
that do not conflict with T-38 mission requirements. The block altitude assigned shall be
10,000-XXX. Lowering MOA areas to 8,000 shall be accomplished on a case by case basis,
requested through the SOF, and approved by RAPCON.
NOTE: Vance 1A, C, D MOAs may be used by T-6s as coordinated with the RAPCON if it
does not interfere with T-1/T-38 ops.
   4.5.1. Beyond 60 miles from Vance, RAPCON provides traffic advisories on only
   transponder equipped aircraft due to primary radar limitations.
4.6. MOA Terms and Phraseology Definitions.
   4.6.1. “PROCEED [or CLEARED] DIRECT AREA (specified area), MAINTAIN
   (altitude).” Aircraft will proceed direct to lateral boundary of specified area at the ATC
 18                                                      VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013


   assigned altitude. Aircraft will maintain assigned altitude until given “CLEARED THE
   BLOCK AREA (xx).”
   4.6.2. “CLEARED THE BLOCK AREA (specified area).” Aircraft will proceed direct to
   specified area and begin the climb or descent into appropriate block altitudes. Aircraft may
   maneuver, while enroute, once within the altitude block but will not turn more than 45
   degrees from a direct line to the assigned area. When “cleared the block” formations are
   approved non-standard formation within 2 miles and 2000 ft vertically of the lead aircraft.
   4.6.3. “CLEARED AREA (specified area), HIGH DEPARTURE.” Aircraft will continue on
   the WAYNO/JACOX stereo route until reaching FL 240 and then proceed direct to assigned
   area. Aircraft will maintain FL 240 until given “CLEARED THE BLOCK AREA (xx).”
   4.6.4. “MANEUVERING APPROVED.” Aircraft may maneuver up to 90 degrees off
   course within the assigned altitude block. Aircraft will not reverse course or perform a 360-
   degree turn without clearance.
   4.6.5. Merging Target Procedures. RAPCON applies merging target procedures to
   participating IFR aircraft IAW the following paragraphs.
      4.6.5.1. RAPCON shall issue radar traffic information to aircraft whose targets are likely
      to merge unless the aircraft are known to be separated vertically.
      4.6.5.2. RAPCON shall issue directions using “work (direction)” control techniques to
      ensure the radar targets of aircraft previously issued as traffic do not touch.
          4.6.5.2.1. Work and Traffic Calls. RAPCON shall provide work calls to assist
          aircraft to remain in their assigned area and in the application of merging target
          procedures:
          4.6.5.2.2. “WORK (direction).” An air traffic control instruction whereby the pilot
          will continue a maneuver to completion then turn toward the specified direction.
          Pilot will acknowledge with callsign.
          4.6.5.2.3. “WORK (direction) IMMEDIATELY.” An air traffic control instruction
          whereby the pilot will break off a maneuver and immediately turn toward the
          specified direction. Pilot will acknowledge with callsign.
4.7. AR-60/AR-70 Definition and Clearance Phraseology. Vance aircraft are the primary
users of Vance AR routes as shown in attachment 18.
   4.7.1. “CLEARED DIRECT (track) [CP/ENTRY POINT/INITIAL POINT], HOLD
   SOUTH AS PUBLISHED”- Aircraft will proceed direct to assigned point and maintain
   altitude.
   4.7.2. “CLEARED THE BLOCK (track) [HIGH/LOW] [CP/ENTRY POINT/INITIAL
   POINT], HOLD SOUTH AS PUBLISHED”- Aircraft will begin climb to the assigned
   altitude block while proceeding direct from present position.
4.8. MOA Saturation Procedures. When weather/traffic causes saturation of the West or
North/East MOAs RAPCON shall coordinate with SOF and Tower to ensure departing aircraft
have an available MOA to complete their mission. T-6 MOA saturation only occurs when all
N/E Low/High areas are in use. SOF may direct RAPCON to announce MOA saturation on area
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                   19


frequencies. Aircraft in the chocks will expect to remain in the chocks until given taxi clearance
from the Tower.
4.9. Western MOA Priorities. RAPCON controllers will assign WMOA areas IAW the
priority list and procedures below.
   4.9.1. T-38s. First priority for inner/middle ring areas, last priority for outer rings.
   4.9.2. T-1s. Last priority for inner/middle ring areas, first priority for outer rings.
   4.9.3. Aircraft that are in the inner/middle rings who don’t have priority will be directed to
   move to an outer ring, if available, or depart once aircraft with the priority begin launching.
4.10. Military Training Routes (MTRs). Flying squadrons schedule routes IAW AP/1B to
ensure they do not conflict. RAPCON conducts IFR routes IAW ZKC/ZFW MTR LOA. Radar
service is automatically terminated when an aircraft reports commencing an IFR MTR.
4.11. Functional Check Flights (FCFs). T-38 FCF profiles are conducted IAW ZKC/ Vance
Approach LOA. After coordinating with ZKC, RAPCON shall advise the aircraft if any delays
are expected. T-6 and T-1 FCFs do not require special handling.

                                            Chapter 5

                                 RECOVERY PROCEDURES

5.1. Recovery to VFR Patterns. RAPCON may issue aircraft a local recovery procedure
(Attachment 19), clear the aircraft direct to the airport/recovery fix or vector the aircraft for
sequencing on the recovery.
   5.1.1. Radar Termination Fixes are:
       5.1.1.1. BFALO (END R-198/11) -- For T-38s or T-1s entering VFR pattern for runway
       35L/35C.
           5.1.1.1.1. When cleared BFALO, aircraft are cleared direct to the fix and to descend
           to 3,000 feet MSL.
       5.1.1.2. CARER (END R-324/10) -- For T-38s or T-1s entering VFR pattern for runway
       17R/17C.
           5.1.1.2.1. When cleared CARER, aircraft are cleared direct to the fix and to descend
           to 3,100 feet MSL.
       5.1.1.3. DLLTA (END R-347/24) -- For T-6s entering VFR pattern at Kegelman.
           5.1.1.3.1. When cleared DLLTA, aircraft are cleared direct to fix and to descend to
           3,000 feet MSL.
       5.1.1.4. ECKHO (END R-014/9) -- For T-6s entering VFR pattern for runway 17L.
           5.1.1.4.1. When cleared ECKHO, aircraft are cleared direct to fix and to descend to
           2,800 feet MSL (2,900 feet MSL when using multi-sensor or Putnam Feed only).
       5.1.1.5. FOXTR (END R-160/9) -- For T-6s entering VFR pattern for runway 35R.
           5.1.1.5.1. When cleared FOXTR, aircraft are cleared direct to fix and to descend to
           2,800 feet MSL (2,900 feet MSL when using multi-sensor or Putnam Feed only).
   5.1.2. Cancellation of IFR/Radar Service Terminated. When Vance aircraft are within 5
   miles of the radar termination fix, they will state “(call sign) (name of fix).” This means they
   are cancelling IFR, descending to pattern altitude, and requesting a frequency change to
   RSU/Tower. Radar service is automatically terminated.
       5.1.2.1. T-6 Contact Approach/Restricted Pattern. When T-6s are within 5 miles of the
       radar termination fix and clear of clouds, they will state "(call sign) request contact." This
       means they are requesting a contact approach to allow descent to pattern altitude along
       their respective recovery ground track. RAPCON will clear aircraft for the contact
       approach by stating "(call sign) cleared contact approach, ECKHO/FOXTR", or will
       issue alternate instructions if a contact approach is not practical. When established at
       pattern altitude with VFR cloud clearances, aircraft will state "(call sign) (cancel IFR,
       ECKHO/FOXTR)." This means they are cancelling IFR and requesting a frequency
       change to RSU/Tower. Radar service is automatically terminated.
           5.1.2.1.1. While executing the contact approach, T-6s will maintain strict adherence
           to the IFG ground track for their respective recovery. T-6s will not deviate from
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                    21


           these ground tracks, nor execute the contact approach past ECKHO/FOXTR in-order
           to achieve VFR conditions. If unable VFR by ECKHO or FOXTR, execute an
           immediate turn to heading 090, climb and maintain 2900' and contact RAPCON on
           Ch 17 for an alternate clearance.
       5.1.2.2. T-38 Contact Approach/Restricted Pattern. When T-38s have been cleared
       direct the radar termination fix, are within 5 miles of the radar termination fix, and clear
       of clouds, they will state "(call sign) REQUEST CONTACT APPROACH." This means
       they are requesting a contact approach to allow VMC descent to pattern altitude along
       their respective recovery ground track. RAPCON will clear aircraft for the contact
       approach by stating "(call sign) CLEARED CONTACT APPROACH,
       BUFFALO/CARRIER ", or will issue alternate instructions if a contact approach is not
       practical. When established at pattern altitude with VFR cloud clearances, aircraft will
       state "(call sign) (CANCEL IFR, BUFFALO/CARRIER).” This means they are
       cancelling IFR and requesting a frequency change to RSU/Tower. Radar service is
       automatically terminated.
           5.1.2.2.1. While executing the contact approach, T-38s will proceed direct to
           BFALO/CARER and will not deviate to achieve VFR conditions. T-38s will not
           continue the contact approach past BFALO/CARER in-order to achieve VFR
           conditions. If unable VFR by BFALO/CARER, execute an immediate turn to
           heading 270, climb and maintain 4000', and contact RAPCON on Ch 12 for an
           alternate clearance.
   5.1.3. Communications Transfer. RAPCON shall advise aircraft what agency (Tower/RSU)
   is controlling the runway, “(call sign) CONTACT (controlling agency).”
5.2. Radar Vectors to Initial. Aircraft requesting vectors to initial shall notify RAPCON
during recovery using the following phraseology: “(call sign) REQUEST INITIAL, (runway
designator).”
5.3. Tactical Initial. Tactical Initials are approved by the Tower based upon traffic, when only
one downwind is in use. Aircraft are flown 4,000 feet abreast, at normal overhead pattern
altitude.
5.4. Restrictions for Instrument Approaches. Separation between Vance runways does not
meet FAA guidelines to allow simultaneous IFR arrivals. Additionally, due to potential conflict
with RSU patterns, VOR/TACAN approaches to runway 17C/35C cannot be conducted during
RSU operations to runway 17L/35R or simultaneously with VOR or GPS approaches to runway
17L/35R. VOR/TACAN and GPS approaches to runway 17L/35R and 17R/35L cannot be
conducted when RSUs control the patterns to the respective runways.
5.5. MARSA during Buttonhook Status. The recovery method for T-6 aircraft during
Buttonhook status is the VOR/DME or GPS A and B approaches.
   5.5.1. RWY 35 Operations.
       5.5.1.1. MARSA is authorized to be applied between 71 FTW T-6s conducting
       VOR/DME A or GPS A approaches to runway 35R simultaneously with any Vance
       assigned aircraft conducting VOR/DME or TACAN, or RNAV (GPS) approaches to
       runway 35L. MARSA would apply to these arrivals from the initial approach fix (IAF)
 22                                                       VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013


       until landing. Weather minimums required to use this application of MARSA are 500
       foot ceiling and 4 miles visibility.
   5.5.2. RWY 17 Operations.

                               EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

6.1. Primary Crash Phone System Procedures. Fire Department (FD), Medical Clinic,
AMOPS and Tower are on the primary crash phone. Tower shall activate the primary crash
phone for in-flight/ground emergencies, barrier engagements, and any unusual circumstances the
Tower supervisor deems as requiring immediate response. During base exercises, Tower shall
preface and terminate activation with the phrase “Exercise, Exercise, Exercise.”
   6.1.1. Primary/Secondary Crash Phone Activation.           Tower transmits the following
   information via the primary crash phone immediately upon receipt: type of emergency
   (ground or airborne), type aircraft, nature of emergency, aircraft call sign, pilot's intentions,
   number of persons on board, fuel remaining in pounds or minutes, estimated time to landing,
   wind information, and tail number. AMOPs activates the Secondary Crash Net (SCN) and
   relays all information received via the Primary Crash Phone. Agencies approved on the SCN
   are FD, Clinic, Command Post (CP), Readiness, Weather Station, Flight Safety, Aircraft
   Maintenance Control, Security Forces (SF), Civil Engineering (CE), Transient Alert, and
   each flying squadron operations duty section.
   6.1.2. Primary/Secondary Crash Phone Checks. Tower shall conduct daily crash phone
   checks Monday thru Friday between 0900-0915 daily or within the first 15 minutes after the
   airfield opens if later than 0900. AMOPs conducts a check of the Secondary Crash Phone
   immediately after the check of the Primary Crash Phone.
6.2. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
Response. If an ELT signal is received outside of the normal testing times (within the first 5
minutes of the hour, no more than 3 audio sweeps), RAPCON shall notify Tower of the
frequency on which the ELT was received. Tower shall notify SOF and AMOPS. The primary
or secondary crash phones are not activated for ELT signals unless directed by the SOF.
6.3. Emergency Response - In-Flight/Ground Emergency Procedures (On/Off Base)
Suspending Runway Operations. AM and FD respond to all in-flight emergencies (IFEs) and
ground emergencies. Flight Medicine will respond to or monitor IFEs IAW VAFB MCRP Plan
800 as dictated by the situation and after discussion with the Fire Chief/Incident commander.
The designated Incident Commander and responsibilities of responding agencies for on/off base
emergencies are in Vance AFB OPlan 91-1, Mishap Response and Airfield Operations Flight
Operating Instruction 91-1 HATARS, Aircraft Accident/Mishap/Incident response, and Reporting
Procedures.
   6.3.1. Positioning of Responding Vehicles. For inbound IFEs, AM and one FD vehicle pre-
   position at the approach end of the landing runway. The Incident Commander, other fire
   vehicles, and the Flight Medicine Primary Response Team pre-position at the departure end
   of the runway. For other IFEs and ground emergencies, all vehicles respond to the site. If an
   emergency vehicle enters the runway the IFE landed on, operations are suspended on that
   runway. NOTE: Security Forces are not an initial responder to an aircraft emergency unless
   requested by the Fire Chief. Security Forces will respond to the flightline side of Base
   Operations and wait. If called to respond, the driver must receive clearance to enter the
 24                                                       VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013


   CMA from the Control Tower. Request from the Fire Chief to respond to the site is not
   clearance to enter or cross a runway.
   6.3.2. Emergency Vehicle Crossing Eastside Controlled Runway. Tower shall coordinate
   with Eastside RSU as soon as practical to facilitate emergency response vehicles crossing of
   the inside runway. IAW AETC 11-204/Vance Sup 1, Eastside will ensure emergency aircraft
   and all emergency response vehicles and equipment receive priority over non-emergency
   traffic. Tower shall retain control of emergency response vehicles for the duration of the
   crossing and shall notify Eastside RSU when all crossings are complete so the RSU may
   resume normal operations.
   6.3.3. Resumption of Runway Operations. Runway operations are not resumed until all
   vehicles are off the runway and AMOPS has conducted a FOD check and released the
   runway to the controlling agency. If no response vehicles enter the runway the SOF may
   determine a FOD check is not required. In this case, Vance Tower shall notify AMOPS “No
   FOD check required” and runway ops may be resumed and AMOPS will document in the
   daily log “SOF declared no FOD check required.”
6.4. Local Emergency Channel. Channel 13 reduces the amount of radio transmissions
required to successfully coordinate with multiple Vance agencies. RAPCON shall monitor
Vance UHF local channel 13. Pilots experiencing an emergency or abnormal situation should
request to recover on this frequency. Upon landing, Tower will direct aircrews not already on
channel 13 to contact the Operations Command on channel 13. Tower will also direct all ground
aircraft emergencies to contact the Operations Command on channel 13. If landing under RSU
control, RSU will direct aircrews to contact the Operations Command on channel 13 only after
the RSU has coordinated with the Tower. SOF may use channel 13 to transmit technical
information to emergency aircraft. RAPCON shall transfer control to the Tower by stating:
“(position) (call sign), EMERGENCY, YOUR CONTROL, CHANNEL 13.” Tower shall
initiate a radio check or, issue instructions to the aircraft. RAPCON shall monitor channel 13
until the pilot acknowledges the Tower.
6.5. IFE Special Handling. RAPCON shall ensure no aircraft are in front of the arriving IFE to
the same runway, when the IFE is 10 mile final. Additionally, RAPCON shall provide at least 5
miles spacing for any aircraft following an IFE. Tower shall not clear an aircraft for departure
with an IFE 10 mile final or closer to the same runway.
6.6. Abandonment of Aircraft. Controller instructions are advisory in nature and the exact
point of ejection is the responsibility of the pilot.
   6.6.1. T-6 Controlled Bailout Area. Bailout area is END 144/15 or the ODG 170/15 at the
   recommended altitude of 4,500 feet MSL.
   6.6.2. T-38 Controlled Bailout Area. Bailout area is END 204/15 at the recommended
   altitude of 4,500 feet MSL.
   6.6.3. Search and Rescue Information. RAPCON/Tower shall relay information concerning
   search and rescue operations for a Vance assigned aircraft IAW Vance Plan 506, Search and
   Rescue and IAW FAA JO 7110.65 for other than Vance assigned aircraft.
6.7. Fuel Dumping. A designated fuel dump area is not established. Aircraft requesting fuel
dumping shall be controlled by RAPCON IAW FAA guidelines.
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                  25


6.8. External Stores Jettison Area. The designated drop area for aircraft to jettison external
fuel tanks/stores is the END 194/21. The recommended altitude is 4,500 feet MSL. Controllers
may provide information or vectors but not give instructions of when stores should be jettisoned.
6.9. T-6 Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) (Attachment 16). Vance ELP approaches are
normally flown to runway 17L/35R with the pattern to the east. Aircraft may request west
pattern or landing on other runways. High key altitude is 3,800 feet MSL to 4,300 feet MSL.
Low Key is 2,800 feet MSL.
   6.9.1. ELP Locations.     ELPs are authorized for 71 FTW T-6 aircraft at Vance,
   Enid/Woodring, and Kegelman airports. Enid/Woodring ELP procedures are IAW the LOA.
   Vance Tower shall control ELPs IAW FAA guidelines.
   6.9.2. ELP Phraseology. Aircraft will request entry into the ELP: “(call sign), (number)
   MILES TO THE (direction from the airport) FOR HIGH KEY.” The controller will direct:
   “REPORT HIGH KEY.” When the aircraft reports High Key the controller will direct:
   “REPORT LOW KEY.”
   6.9.3. ELP Notification Procedures. When a T-6 declares an emergency and requests an
   ELP, the controlling agency will make a Guard call: “EMERGENCY LANDING
   PATTERN PROCEDURES ARE IN EFFECT AT (airport name).” To resume normal
   operations the controlling agency will make a Guard Call: "EMERGENCY LANDING
   PATTERN PROCEDURES ARE TERMINATED, RESUME NORMAL OPERATIONS.”
   6.9.4. When there is a T-6 emergency recovering for an ELP, Tower shall not conduct any
   operations on runway 17C/35C while the emergency ELP is in progress.
   6.9.5. ELP Training. Non-emergency aircraft may initiate the ELP by requesting High Key.
   Practice ELP’s are normally flown to the east.
6.10. Aircraft Mishap Response/Reporting Procedures. Aircraft incident/mishap, Hazardous
Air Traffic Report/Military Facility Deviation response/reporting procedures will be IAW Vance
Mishap OPlan 91-1 and AOF OI 91-1.
6.11. Anti-hijacking/Prevention of Unauthorized Aircraft Movement. AMOPS, Tower, and
RAPCON prevent/respond IAW FAA JO 7110.65, FAA JO 7610.4, AFI 13-207, and VAFB
Plan 502/Anti- hijacking and Prevention of Unauthorized Aircraft Movement.

               SUPERVISOR OF FLYING (SOF) INTERFACE WITH ATC

7.1. SOF Communication with ATC Supervisors. SOFs shall not perform ATC functions.
The SOF will coordinate with the Tower/RAPCON Watch Supervisors rather than
communicating directly with the controllers working the position.
7.2. SOF Coordination. The SOF will coordinate with the Tower and/or RAPCON Watch
Supervisors and AMOPs on status information, diverts, runway changes, emergencies, and when
expecting visitors.
7.3. ATC Watch Supervisor Coordination. Tower and RAPCON Watch Supervisors shall
advise the SOF of any conditions that may interfere with or curtail 71 FTW aircraft operations.
Only published ATC or area frequencies shall be used to pass status information, runway
changes, etc. When needed the SOF will coordinate with the Tower Watch Supervisor to have
the RAPCON broadcast on guard.
7.4. SOF Communication on an ATC Frequency. IAW AFI 13-204 vol 3, the SOF shall
coordinate with the facility Watch Supervisor to transmit directly to the affected aircraft on an
ATC frequency if extremely technical information needs to be passed to emergency aircraft.
Normally this information is transmitted on the SOF’s frequency or channel 13 (local emergency
frequency). The SOF shall not transmit ATC instructions or clearances.
7.5. SOF Program Manager Responsibilities. The program manager will contact the facility
Chief Controller (CCTLR) or AOF/CC when they become aware of any problem between a SOF
and ATC.
   7.5.1. Facility Access. The SOF program manager will provide the Tower CCTLR with a
   current authorized access list.
   7.5.2. SOF Training Capability. SOF training is limited to one SOF trainee in the Tower at a
   time.

                                           Chapter 8

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

8.1. Vance Initial Airfield Opening. When the airfield is to open and there is lightning within
5 NM of the aerodrome, opening airfield checks and barrier checks cannot be accomplished.
When this occurs, the airfield will be NOTAMed closed until the lightning is outside of 5 NM
and the opening check can be accomplished by AM and barrier configuration is completed by the
FD.
8.2. Airfield Transfer of Control. SF Transfer of Control to AM. SF maintains control of the
airfield when it is closed. Any personnel requiring access to the airfield during this period must
coordinate with SF prior to going onto the airfield. SF logs call signs of all vehicles that have
accessed the airfield.
   8.2.1. AMOPS Transfer of Control to Tower. At least one hour prior to airfield opening,
   AMOPS contacts SF, via hotline, to obtain control of the airfield and the call sign of each
   vehicle on the airfield. AMOPS documents all vehicles on the airfield and the SF individual
   from which control was received on AF IMT 3616. AMOPS advises Tower of the call signs
   of all vehicles on the airfield and transfers control of the airfield to Tower prior to airfield
   opening time.
   8.2.2. Tower Assumption of Airfield Control. After accepting control of the airfield, Tower
   shall confirm the location of all vehicles and request any other vehicles to check in. Tower
   logs each vehicle's call sign and at the official opening airfield time, announces on all
   assigned frequencies: "Vance airfield is open, contact Tower for approval onto any controlled
   movement areas."
   8.2.3. Tower Releasing Control of Airfield to SF. Upon closing, Tower shall notify SF of the
   call sign of all known vehicles on the airfield prior to transferring control. At the official
   closing airfield time, Tower shall announce "Vance airfield is closed” on all ATC
   frequencies and FM nets excluding guard.
8.3. Transient Aircraft. Transient aircraft must coordinate with AMOPS to obtain a prior
permission required (PPR) number. AMOPS coordinates transient arrivals and departures with
base agencies. Transient services are available during airfield hours IAW the IFR Supplement.
   8.3.1. Civilian Aircraft Operations. Civil aircraft operations are authorized if the required
   landing permit has been granted. AMOPS shall process all civilian aircraft landing requests
   IAW AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits. All civilian aircraft operations, even
   those with HQ USAF/XOO-BC approved landing permits, must have 71 FTW/CC’s approval
   prior to landing. The 71 FTW/CC delegates approval authority to the 71 OG/CC.
   8.3.2. Practice Approaches by Civilian Aircraft. Civilian aircraft are authorized to use
   Vance Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs) for practice instrument approaches, provided student
   flying is not in progress. Two-way radio contact with ATC must be maintained at all times.
   Aircraft shall not be cleared to land, touch-and-go, or stop-and-go unless Vance AFB is the
   approved destination airport or the aircraft has declared an emergency.
   8.3.3. Military Aero Club Operations. Military aero club aircraft are exempt from the
   requirement for a civil aircraft landing permit.
 28                                                          VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013


       8.3.3.1. Transient aero club operations are not authorized during wing flying hours.
   8.3.4. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals. If an unscheduled (no arrival notice) military aircraft
   lands at Vance, Tower shall obtain the point of departure from the aircraft and relay to
   AMOPS. If a military aircraft requests landing at Vance without PPR coordination, Tower
   shall obtain reason for landing. The Airfield Manager (AFM) shall determine if the aircraft
   arrival is authorized and can be accommodated and shall relay approval to the Tower. If the
   arrival cannot be accommodated, Tower shall deny landing clearance.
   8.3.5. Unauthorized Landings. Civil aircraft landing without prior approval are considered
   an unauthorized landing. This may occur whether the airfield is open or closed. If an
   unauthorized landing occurs, SF and AMOPS shall respond IAW Vance AFB Integrated
   Defense Plan 31-101.
8.4. Precision Approach Critical Areas. Aircraft/vehicle operations in the Precision Obstacle
Free Zone (POFZ), Localizer and Glideslope critical areas (Attachment 2) may affect the
integrity of the ILS signal. Tower shall restrict vehicles/aircraft from proceeding past the
instrument hold lines IAW AFI 13-204 vol 3. Vehicle operators are trained IAW VAFBI 13-
201, Airfield Driving Program, to hold short of instrument hold lines when the taxiway lights are
on and to contact Tower for clearance prior to proceeding beyond that point. Tower shall turn on
all taxiway lights whenever the ceiling is less than 800 feet or the visibility is less than 2 miles.
8.5. Airfield Lighting Systems. Tower personnel shall turn off all airfield lighting when the
airfield closes. The airfield lighting system consists of the following:
   8.5.1. Runway 17C/35C: Short Approach Lighting System with Sequenced Flashing Lights
   (SALSF), High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL), and Precision Approach Path Indicator
   Lights (PAPI).
   8.5.2. Runway 17R/35L: HIRL, PAPI and SALS.
   8.5.3. Runway 17L/35R: Medium Intensity Runway Lights (MIRL) with Runway End
   Identifier Lights (REIL) on 17L.
   8.5.4. Taxiways: Taxiway edge lights are installed on all usable taxiways,        except      for
   taxiway D between runways 17L/35R and 17C/35C.
   8.5.5. A SALSF installed on a precision runway, as configured on runway 17C/35C, is
   nonstandard. Additionally, the installation of PAPIs on the right sides of runways 17C/35C
   and 17R/35L is nonstandard.
8.6. BAK-15 Aircraft Arresting Systems Procedures. BAK-15 arresting systems are located
approximately 155 feet into the overrun of runway 17C, approximately 152 feet into the overrun
of 17R, approximately 155 feet into the overrun of 35C and approximately 152 feet into the
overrun of 35L. They are normally maintained in the lowered position. Raised BAK-15’s are 24
feet high and are only designed for departure end engagements. BAK-15s are not capable of
successive engagements. Departure end barriers are to remain in the raised position when
freezing precipitation is forecasted. IAW AFI 32-1043, Managing, Operating and Maintaining
Aircraft Arresting Systems, the approach end BAK-15s are disconnected from the energy
absorbers (chains) but remain lowered, in place.
   8.6.1. Activation of BAK-15. Tower is responsible for the activation of the BAK-15s on
   Tower controlled runways. Tower will not raise the barrier unless requested by an aircraft,
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                   29


   RSUs, or as directed by the SOF, except to complete operational checks and as provided in
   para 8.6.2. When Tower is controlling both runways 17C/35C and 17R/35L, both departure
   end barriers shall be raised when a barrier is called for. Shoehorn may raise the barrier for a
   solo student if they deem it necessary.
   8.6.2. Transfer of BAK-15 Controls to RSU. When the RSU assumes control of a runway
   Tower transfers control of the BAK-15 to the RSU. During transfers of runways/barriers, it
   shall be specifically stated “Tower/RSU has control of the barrier.” If the RSU barrier
   control switch is inoperative Tower shall maintain control of the barrier. The RSU will
   coordinate with the Tower by direct line if the barrier needs to be raised. An operational
   check of the barrier will be conducted by the Tower/RSU when they assume control of the
   runway.
8.7. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS). Vance AFB operates and maintains the Vance Very High
Frequency Omni directional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC), identifier is END.
Additionally Vance AFB operates/maintains ILS equipment to runways 17C/35C. All
NAVAIDS are equipped with backup power generators that have reliable auto-start capability.
Vance AFB NAVAIDS and the Digital Airport Surveillance Radar are not part of the National
Airspace System (NAS).
   8.7.1. Vance RAPCON is the NAVAID monitoring facility. During outages of the
   VORTAC, Vance aircraft will depart and recover using other navigation equipment or via
   radar vectors.
   8.7.2. No NOTAM Preventive Maintenance Inspections (PMI) Times. No NOTAM PMI
   times are published in the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) SUPPLEMENT.
8.8. ATC Facilities. Tower and RAPCON are equipped with backup power generators that
have reliable auto-start capability.
   8.8.1. Operating hours normally coincide with airfield hours outlined in paragraph 1.1.

   8.8.2. Exceptions to Published Hours. 71 OG/CC is the approval authority for operating
   hours that differ from the published airfield and ATC facility hours.
8.9. Tower Operations without RAPCON Open. Tower ops, when the RAPCON is closed,
are conducted IAW with the Kansas City Center (ZKC)/Vance Tower Letter of Agreement
(LOA).
8.10. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). Vance ATIS is operated IAW FAA
JO 7110.65 continuously during wing flying.
   8.10.1. The following local procedures will be utilized:
       8.10.1.1. Pertinent NOTAMS will be broadcasted for the first 24 hours, starting when the
       NOTAM was issued. After 24 hours, the NOTAM will be removed from the ATIS.
       8.10.1.2. Broadcast airfield status information anytime the status is reported as
       RESTRICTED PATTERN, BUTTONHOOK, PUBLISHED RECOVERY or anytime
       ALTERNATES are required.
       8.10.1.3. Broadcast the bird watch condition when reported as severe at Vance or
       Woodring.

8.11. Frequencies/Local Channelization (Attachment 4) and Ground Station/Vehicle Call
Signs (Attachment 5). Vance aircraft are channelized for most Vance ATC frequencies.
   8.11.1. The Crash Net is dedicated for use between Fire Department vehicles and between
   the Fire Department and the Control Tower. The Tower does not monitor the Crash Net
   continuously. The Tower will monitor the Crash Net anytime the Primary Crash Phone is
   activated, a barrier check or runway change is in progress, or anytime as requested by the
   Fire Department.
8.12. Delegation of Vance Approach Airspace. Vance RAPCON airspace (Attachment 6) is
delegated to Vance and operations are conducted IAW the ZKC/Fort Worth Center (ZFW)
Approach Control, Instrument Route (IR) and Military Operations Areas (MOA) LOAs.
   8.12.1. Designation of Vance Approach Airspace. Vance RAPCON airspace, the approach
   control and western MOA/ATC Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) airspace, consists of Class A,
   E, and G airspace. Altitudes east of the END 47 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) arc
   are surface to FL 240. Altitudes west of the END 47 DME arc are 8,000 to FL 240.
   8.12.2. Special Use Airspace. Portions of the Vance Approach airspace are designated as
   MOAs. Vance MOAs are designated 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and have ATCAA associated along
   with each of them. Two alert areas (Alert Areas 562-A and 562-B) are designated for high
   density student pilot training.
   8.12.3. Radar Final Approach Capability. Vance RAPCON does not have Airport
   Surveillance Radar (ASR) or Precision Approach Radar (PAR) final approach capability.
8.13. Weather Dissemination via New Tactical Forecast System/Joint Environmental
Toolkit (NTFS/JET). NTFS/JET interfaces with Airfield Automation System (AFAS) which

Complete
                                        the Tower.

9.2. Tower/RSU Coordination for Transients. Tower shall direct RSUs to stop departures in
order to ensure IFR transient arrivals/departures to runway 17C/35C and 17R/35L do not operate
simultaneously with RSU departures.
     9.2.1. Landing/Departure Runway for Transient Aircraft. If landing on any other runway is
     required, Tower will control that runway. If runway 17C/35C is closed for an emergency or
     during scheduled runway 17C/35C closure, Tower will coordinate to obtain runway 17R/35L
     from Shoehorn. Once control of the runway and barrier controls are transferred, Tower will
     clear the transient to land or takeoff.
NOTE: All local aircraft established in Shoehorn/Eastside pattern will remain under RSU
control and be placed in the high pattern to avoid conflicts with Tower controlled aircraft.
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                     33


   9.2.2. Transient Aircraft Crossing RSU Controlled Runways. Transient aircraft taxiing will
   remain on Ground Control frequency. Tower shall coordinate with RSUs for crossing the
   RSU controlled runway.
   9.2.3. When civilian aircraft are inspecting gas pipeline within Vance Class D Airspace, and
   are projected to cross the arrival/departure corridor within 3 miles of the field, the following
   procedures shall be used. When Tower receives information regarding aircraft conducting
   pipeline operations, Tower will immediately pass this information to RAPCON and RSU’s.
   If first contact is via phone, Tower will pass the approximate time pipeline procedures are
   proposed and any applicable additional information to the SOF.
       9.2.3.1. Pipeline Communication Procedures. When the pipeline aircraft makes initial
       radio contact with Tower, Tower will advise the aircraft to remain outside of the Class D
       airspace until coordination has been accomplished. Tower will notify RAPCON and
       RSUs: “Propose pipeline procedures at (time), (time check), (pipeline aircraft current
       location)” and broadcast on all appropriate frequencies: “Attention all aircraft, propose
       pipeline procedures at (time), (time check)”. When the RSUs are prepared to allow
       pipeline procedures to begin, they will tell tower: “Pipeline procedures are in effect.”
       Once the pipeline aircraft is exiting the Class D, advise the appropriate agencies “Pipeline
       procedures terminated, (pipeline aircraft current location)”.
       9.2.3.2. Pipeline Procedures In Effect. Once notified by RSU’s “Pipeline procedures are
       in effect”, Tower will, traffic permitting, allow pipeline aircraft into Class D once all
       aircraft have been de-conflicted. RAPCON will hold arriving aircraft not established on
       final approach at or within the Final Approach Fix to Vance AFB until termination of
       pipeline procedures. Controllers may continue to allow aircraft returning to Vance via
       radar release points (Buffalo, Carrier, Foxtrot, Echo) to enter the pattern unless advised
       the pattern is saturated. Pipeline aircraft has priority over wing assigned aircraft unless
       necessary for the safety of air traffic operations.
9.3. Tower or RSU Radio Failure. If Tower radios fail they shall utilize light gun signals. If
the RSU loses radios, the RSU will inform Tower via the land line to instruct all solo students to
make one approach to a full stop. If the RSU has lost both radio and telephonic capability and a
cell phone is not available, the RSU will use a flashing red light gun signal to advise aircraft and
Tower of radio failure and the relinquishing of control for that runway.
9.4. Control Tower Evacuation. Tower shall be evacuated when the 71 OG/CC, SOF, Airfield
Operations Officer, Tower CCTLR, and/or Watch Supervisor determine continued operations
from the facility constitute a hazardous or unsafe environment for personnel or equipment
outages limit capabilities. Tower shall evacuate when the wind exceeds 55 knots (sustained).
When Tower evacuates due to winds they shall remain at AMOPS, building 155 and shall not
conduct alternate operations.
9.5. Alternate Control Tower Operations. The approach end runway 17C/35C RCS is the
only designated alternate facility. Operations from any other RCS are not configured to support
activation of runway 17C/35C departure-end barrier. In an emergency evacuation requiring
alternate Control Tower operations, AMOPS will transport controllers to the RCS if available.
   9.5.1. Alternate Tower Radio Capabilities. Runway 17C/35C RCS has two single channel
   preset radios. One set to 259.1 and another set for 243.0. A UHF multi-channel radio is also
 34                                                      VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013


   available to be set to 289.4 for ground operations. Airfield systems maintenance can deliver
   a portable VHF radio. AMOPS can provide land mobile radios.
   9.5.2. Alternate Tower Equipment Limitations. Airfield lighting can be controlled through
   CE personnel at the lighting vault. Weather and AMOPS will provide weather reports,
   NOTAMs, and airfield information via commercial landlines. ATIS will not be available.
   In the event of an emergency, AMOPS will be notified via commercial landlines. Primary
   communications between the alternate Tower and the RAPCON will be via the direct line
   available in the RCS.
   9.5.3. Alternate Tower Service Limitations. Due to poor visibility/limited equipment,
   arrivals will be limited to a straight-in full stop only (ILS, TACAN, Visual Approach, etc)
   and ground control services will be advisory in nature only.
   9.5.4. Alternate Tower Manning. Minimum manning is one (1) 7-Level Watch Supervisor
   and two (2) facility rated controllers during wing flying. At other times, minimum manning
   is two (2) facility rated controllers, one (1) of which will be Watch Supervisor qualified.
RAPCON Facility Operations.
9.6. RAPCON Evacuation. The RAPCON shall be evacuated when continued operations from
the facility constitute a hazardous or unsafe environment for personnel. No alternate facility
exists for the RAPCON. The RAPCON shall return Vance airspace to ZKC before evacuation.
9.7. RAPCON Radar Outage. The RAPCON shall broadcast radar outage to aircraft and
coordinate with affected agencies. During non-radar ops the following are not authorized:
Multiple instrument approaches, MARSA arrival/departure procedures, MOA or AR operations,
except the MOA may be used for non-radar transition, and recovering base assigned aircraft.
Non-radar operations cannot be conducted if Vance VORTAC is out of service.
   9.7.1. Non-Radar Recovery Plan. Aircraft will advise RAPCON of their intentions. Vance
   aircraft are expected to cancel IFR and recover VFR to Vance or divert airports. Those
   aircraft unable to proceed VFR will be issued altitudes and non-radar routes to divert
   locations. Those aircraft unable to proceed VFR or divert can expect non-radar routes and
   recovery delays at Vance.
   9.7.2. Return of Vance Approach Airspace. IAW ZKC/Vance Approach LOA, once Vance
   aircraft have diverted or recovered, RAPCON shall return the approach airspace.
9.8. Vance ATC Radio Inoperative Procedures. RAPCON/Tower shall use Guard/locally
assigned ATC frequencies to direct pilots to a common control frequency. All aircraft can be
expected to recover VFR. Those unable to recover VFR should consider diverting. IFR
recoveries can expect delays.

   10.9.2. Airfield waivers can be found on the Vance local S drive. The path to access the
   files is: S:\Public\Airfield Waivers\Current Waivers Listing.
10.10. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield. There are no restricted or classified areas
on Vance airfield.
10.11. Airfield Sweeping. All active runways and taxiways will be swept each night Sunday
thru Thursday between approximately 0030L until 0730L (Closed runways and taxiways are not
swept or maintained). A sweeper operator is available whenever the airfield is open. The
sweeper operator will coordinate with SF for access to the airfield when the airfield and AMOPS
are closed. When the Tower is open the sweeper operator will contact Tower for access into the
CMA and maintain constant radio contact until out of the CMA. The sweeper operator will
notify AMOPs, via radio when entering and departing the airfield.
10.12. Airfield Mowing. Mower operators will monitor the airfield net at all times while on the
airfield and will advise AMOPS and Tower of their work location. Mowers will not work within
the CMA when the airfield is open.
10.13. Aircraft Towing. Aircraft towing shall be conducted IAW AFOSHSTD 91-100,
Aircraft Flight Line Ground Operations and Activities, and AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management. Aircraft towing operations will yield to all taxiing aircraft. All
vehicular traffic will yield to aircraft towing operations.
10.14. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures. Vance Aircraft Maintenance and Operations Control
Center (MOCC) will coordinate all maintenance engine test and run-up procedures IAW AFI 21-
101.
10.15. Opening and Closing Runways/Taxiways. AM has the authority to impose airfield
restrictions (close/suspend airfield, runway or taxiway operations) IAW chapter 21 of this
instruction. Runway closure requires AMOPs to transmit a NOTAM. Once a runway has been
closed, only AM may open the runway after a Foreign Object Damage (FOD) check has been
conducted to ensure the runway is safe for aircraft operations.
10.16. Suspending Runway Operations. Runway operations are suspended any time an
emergency vehicle goes onto the runway in response to an emergency, or when the Tower Watch
Supervisor, Senior Controller, AMOPS, or SOF deems a potential FOD hazard exists.
Operations will be suspended until AMOPS conducts a FOD check of the runway and releases
the runway to the controlling agency. If no vehicle enters the runway the SOF may waive a FOD
check. In this case AMOPS will document in the daily log “the FOD check was waived by the
SOF.”
   10.16.1. To facilitate emergency vehicle movement on a RSU controlled runway, Tower will
   request control of the runway, and suspend operations to that runway to allow emergency
   vehicle movement to include AMOPS response for FOD checks. If the SOF waives the FOD
   check, the Tower will not request control of the affected runway.
   10.16.2. Regardless of controlling agency during a runway suspension, aircraft may not fly
   lower than 500’ above the suspended runway. Takeoffs, landings, touch and go’s etc are not
   allowed.
10.17. Airfield Inspections/Checks. Airfield Management will complete an airfield FOD and
Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) check or airfield inspection daily prior to the airfield
VANCEAFBI13-204 9 APRIL 2013                                                                   39


opening. Additional FOD checks are conducted as needed, such as while monitoring
construction areas, in responding to FOD reports, or heavy aircraft arrival/departures, etc.
Airfield Management will also conduct an airfield inspection each morning the airfield is open.
NOTE: An opening FOD/BASH check is not required if an Airfield Inspection has been
completed prior to the airfield opening.
   10.17.1. Airfield Lighting Checks. Airfield Management conducts an evening airfield
   lighting serviceability check and pavement marking reflectivity check whenever the airfield
   will remain open beyond sunset.
       10.17.1.1. In accordance with AFI 13-204 Vol 3, para. 15.1.1.3.41.5. a Civil Engineering
       electrician conducts an inspection of the entire airfield lighting system each day prior to
       airfield opening. The result of the inspection is reported to AMOPS who will document
       the inspection completion in the daily log. Outages, which cannot be repaired
       immediately, are reported to AMOPS. Lighting outages will be handled IAW AFI 13-
       204 vol 3, attachment 11.
   10.17.2. BAK-15 Inspections. Fire Department personnel inspect and configure the barriers
   daily, prior to the first takeoff of the day. FD Control Center will report the results of the
   inspection and the equipment status to AMOPS. AMOPS will document the inspection and
   equipment status in the daily log.
   10.17.3. Pavement or Lighting Discrepancies. Discrepancies are entered into the AMOPS
   outage database and reported to CE for repair. The work order number received is tracked
   until repaired. Pavement discrepancies or lighting effecting aircraft operations are
   coordinated with Wing Safety, 71 OSS/CC, and 71 OG/CC.
   10.17.4. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and/or Runway Condition Reading (RCR)
   Values. AMOPS will conduct and report pavement condition readings on all Vance active
   runways whenever the airfield is open IAW AFI 13-204 vol 3 and T.O. 33-1-23. RCR checks
   may also be conducted on taxiways and the parallel taxi lane with the results being advisory
   in nature. RCR readings are not conducted within the aircraft parking areas.
   10.17.5. Bird/Wildlife Control and Bird Watch Conditions. AMOPS, Tower, and RAPCON
   apply bird and wildlife control and bird watch procedures IAW VAFB Plan 91-2. Bird
   watch conditions are published in VAFBI Plan 91-1, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard.
   10.17.6. Quarterly Joint Airfield Inspections. The AFM or AAFM and other representatives
   conduct a quarterly joint airfield inspection of Vance AFB and Kegelman Auxiliary Airfield.

between flying operations and ceremonies. Observe the following restrictions unless deemed
otherwise by the OG/CC.
   10.18.1. Sterile Quiet Period Restrictions. No ground (i.e. engines running, taxing, engine
   starts) or pattern operations may be in progress. Flying operations away from the airfield
   may continue.
   10.18.2. Non-Sterile Quiet Period. T-6s may start and taxi. Runway 17L/35R cannot be
   used for takeoffs, patterns, or landings. T-38s may start and taxi. T-38s cannot use runway
   17C/35C but may depart runway 17R/35L, and conduct patterns to the outside runway. T-1
   operations are not restricted.
10.19. Airfield Snow Removal Operations. Snow and ice removal procedures and priorities
are conducted IAW VAFB Plan 32-1002, Snow and Ice Removal and Control Plan.
10.20. Reduced Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Capability. In the event of reduced
aircraft rescue and fire fighting capabilities, the FD notifies AMOPS and CP. AMOPS will
notify the SOF, Tower, RAPCON, and AOF/CC. AMOPS will also send a NOTAM, if
applicable, advertising the reduced fire protection.
10.21. Airfield Smoking Policy. Smoking west of the security wall that runs north and south
along the flightline is not authorized unless in designated authorized smoking areas. Designated
smoking areas are provided near the flight line shacks along the east edge of the parking apron.
10.22. Taking of Photographs. Photography on the airfield is IAW Integrated Defense Plan
31-101.
10.23. Wear of Hats. Hats worn on the flightline will be IAW AFOSHTD 91-100, Aircraft

Note 1: Any formation flight (holding hands) FS behind a preceding single ship or formation
flight is 6000ft.
Note 2: Separation For T-1 is CLEAR of RWY for a DEPT following a FS. All other RSRS for
T-1 aircraft is 6000ft.
Note 3: In those cases where 3000ft can be used, alternate sides of the runway must be used.
When alternate sides cannot be employed, the minimum is 6000ft. IE: T-38 crosswind landing
procedures. DO NOT use airborne in these instances.
Note 4: RSRS may be applied between a landing formation and a subsequent single aircraft
arrival (SIMILAR TYPE AIRCRAFT ONLY), providing both formation aircraft are positioned
on the exit side if the runway.
Note 5: RSRS is NOT AUTHORIZED when:
                 Aircraft are cleared for the option
                 Between trainer and non trainer aircraft
                 RCR is less than 14
                 When the tower deems aircraft safety will be jeopardized
                 An emergency aircraft is involved
Note 6: Night Operations: During night operations, RSRS is 6000ft minimum, if the controller
can see the aircraft involved and determine distances by references to suitable nighttime
landmarks (lighted distance markers, etc). Otherwise, standard FAA separation will apply.
Note 7: RSRS using Wet Runway: All above rules apply during wet runway operations.
