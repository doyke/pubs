                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

3.1. General. This chapter outlines the minimum training and currencies required for CAP-
USAF aircrew following QT. (Refer to education and training course announcement for ancillary
training.)
3.2. Training Cycle. There are two semiannual training cycles: 1 January to 30 June, and 1 July
to 31 December.
3.3. Local Area Orientation (LAO). All pilots must complete LAO prior to performing pilot
in command (PIC) duties in the assigned LR. LAO is not required for pilots assigned or attached
to HQ CAP-USAF who complete QT locally, or pilots who complete QT in the assigned LR.
Pilots will reaccomplish LAO if assigned to a new region or to HQ CAP-USAF.
     3.3.1. Ground Training. Complete LR-specific local area survival training according to
     Table 3.1.
     3.3.2. Flying Training. Complete a local area orientation sortie supervised by an LR-
     assigned CAP-USAF pilot. This sortie will emphasize local area hazards, airfields, and
     procedures.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Table 3.1 summarizes CAP-USAF pilot ground training
requirements. For ground training prescribed by other instructions, units must refer to those
instructions for the latest requirement. Initial ground training accomplished during QT may be
credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.

                                 SPECIALIZED TRAINING

4.1. General. The training programs in this chapter provide training which allows CAP-USAF
pilots to familiarize themselves with CAP flying operations and programs.
   4.1.1. CAP-USAF/XO must approve entry into all training programs in this chapter. LR
   commanders will forward training requests through CAP-USAF/XOV to CAP-USAF/XO,
   and will maintain a copy of the approval in the pilot’s training folder until training is
   complete.
   4.1.2. All certification training will be conducted by an appropriately certified CAP-USAF
   IP.
4.2. Additional Aircraft Equipment Certification Training. The CAP-USAF commander
will certify pilots to operate aircraft with fixed pitch propellers, variable pitch propellers,
retractable landing gear, or a turbocharged engine. Certified pilots may operate any aircraft with
similar equipment. LRs conduct additional aircraft equipment certification training according to
a CAP-USAF/XO-approved training syllabus. Additional aircraft equipment certification
training may be completed during QT or IP training.
4.3. IP Training. IP training qualifies pilots to perform instructor duties in CAP-USAF aircraft.
The primary method of completing IP training is to attend and complete the CAP-USAF/XO
approved IP training course at Maxwell AFB. CAP-USAF/XO may approve in-unit (LR) IP
training on a case-by-case basis using the CAP-USAF/XO-approved syllabus. A CAP-USAF IP
will conduct all IP training. IP training is considered complete after successful completion of an
instructor evaluation according to AFI 11-2CAP-USAF, Volume 2. Pilots who complete IP
training may instruct any specialized training programs for which they are certified.
4.4. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Certificated Flight Instructor
(CFI)/Certificated Flight Instrument Instructor (CFII) Training. This training provides
CAP-USAF IPs with experience flying and instructing civil-type flight maneuvers according to
the FAA single-engine practical test standards for private pilot, commercial pilot, and CFI. This
training is not required if the pilot already has the FAA ratings.
   4.4.1. Prerequisites. Pilots must be IP qualified and have a minimum of 75-hours in CAP-
   USAF aircraft (or an equivalent), including flight time during QT. Candidates should have 2
   years of retainability.
   4.4.2. Ground Training and Flying Training. LRs conduct FAA CFI/CFII training
   according to a CAP-USAF/XO-approved training syllabus.
4.5. Mountain Certification Training. LR commanders will certify CAP-USAF pilots for
flight over designated mountainous terrain when outside the unit-defined local training area. The
Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Part 95, Subpart B, designates mountainous terrain. For a
list, go to the CFR. LRs will conduct mountain certification training according to a CAP-
USAF/XO-approved training syllabus.
4.6. Glass Cockpit (G-1000) Certification Training. LR commanders will certify CAP-USAF
pilots to operate G-1000-equipped aircraft. G-1000 training certifies pilots to perform instrument

flight rules (IFR) area navigation (RNAV) enroute procedures, and RNAV global positioning
system (GPS) terminal procedures. Pilots may be certified to lateral navigation (LNAV),
LNAV/vertical navigation (LNAV/VNAV), or global navigation satellite system landing system
(GLS) minimums, depending on aircraft equipment. LRs will conduct all G-1000 training
according to a CAP-USAF/XO-approved syllabus.
4.7. GPS Approach Certification Training. LR commanders will certify CAP-USAF pilots to
operate GPS-equipped aircraft. GPS approach training certifies pilots to perform IFR RNAV
enroute procedures and RNAV GPS terminal procedures. Pilots will only be certified to LNAV
minimums. CAP-USAF pilots will complete GPS approach training before flying GPS
approaches in IMC conditions. LRs will conduct GPS approach training according to a CAP-
USAF/XO-approved syllabus. G-1000 training fulfills the requirement for GPS approach
training. Note: Prior to GPS approach certification, a pilot may operate GPS-equipped aircraft
without using the GPS system for IFR if the aircraft is suitably equipped.
