                                           Chapter 1

                                CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

1.1. Background. During natural disasters or national emergencies, the ability to quickly assess
the status of Air Force members, Department of the Air Force (DAF) and Non-appropriated
Funds (NAF) civilians, Contractors (overseas assigned) and families is critical. Both our ability
to recover from these incidents and to return to normal operations are top priorities.
1.2. Introduction. This instruction outlines accountability requirements and procedures for Air
Force units, agencies, commanders, directors and Joint assigned Air Force members. In order to
ensure all personnel are accounted for, it is paramount that all Air Force installations and units
have recall and evacuation plans in place and personnel are aware of their responsibilities to
ensure fast, accurate accountability.
1.3. Scope. The roles and responsibilities of involved agencies are fully explained in this
instruction. Understanding and accomplishing these roles and responsibilities are crucial for
ensuring the accurate and timely actions necessary to establish Total Force Accountability
(TFA). Central to accountability during a disaster event is the commander’s inherent
responsibility to ensure awareness of the status of personnel under their command. Commanders
must take prudent measures and apply the guidance outlined in this instruction to ensure they are
able to account for all personnel. This instruction is intended to aid commanders and those
involved in personnel accountability by providing guidance on accountability for
victims/survivors of an event. It is not intended to govern accountability for forces deployed in
support of rescue, recovery, or contingency operations.

                                            Chapter 2

                                      RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Personnel accountability is a shared responsibility between a commander/staff agency
chief, supervisor, and their assigned personnel. Under certain circumstances however, their
ability to accurately track and account for the required forces and certain family members may
be impeded. Utilizing robust systems and ensuring individual members are aware of reporting
requirements will ensure that accountability can be achieved in the direst of situations.
2.2. Unit Commanders/Agency Chiefs. Unit Commanders/Agency Chiefs are responsible to
establish accountability of assigned members, including military, DAF, NAF civilians, Defense
Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) enrolled family members, family members of
DAF/NAF employees (when receiving evacuation entitlements), and outside of the contiguous
United States assigned contractors and their family members as soon as possible, but not later
than 48 hours after TFA is directed.
     2.2.1. Ensure a unit recall roster and an actionable communications-out (Comm-Out) recall
     roster are maintained and updated monthly in the event local communications is inoperative
     or overloaded. Comm-Out procedures will be implemented when directed. Refer to Section
     4.2. of this instruction.
     2.2.2. Be familiar with wing operational plans and situations that may require alert
     notifications.
     2.2.3. Ensure unit personnel are trained on alert notification and recall procedures. Unit
     commanders/agency chiefs will coordinate all unit alert notification and recalls with the 30
     SW Inspector General (30 SW/IGI) in order to de-conflict with any planned wing exercises.
     2.2.4. Notify key leadership of on-site associated contractors. The high degree of contractor
     cooperation required to accomplish Vandenberg AFB mission sets, often requires
     contractor’s awareness of alert postures and installation readiness status.
2.3. 30th Space Wing Command Post (30 SW/CP). The 30 SW/CP will be responsible for the
overall operation of the alert notification system (i.e., transmit AtHoc message, update
Commander’s Access Channel, activate Base Siren, etc.) and for making alert notifications, as
directed by the 30th Space Wing Commander (30 SW/CC), or designated representative.
2.4. Unit Control Centers (UCC)/Group Control Center (GCC). UCC/GCCs are responsible
for consolidating and relaying strength and accountability reports to the Personnel Control
Center. The Installation Personnel Readiness Office is responsible to train UCC/GCC on the
accountability reporting process.
2.4.1. UCC/GCCs serve as a commander’s communications conduit to each individual assigned
to an organization. They also provide a single contact for resources requested from Incident
Commander via 30th Security Forces Squadron Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) or
30th Civil Engineering Squadron/Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
     2.4.2. UCC/GCCs relay emergency information within the chain of command regarding
     major accidents, natural disasters, and enemy attacks. They also direct, monitor, and report
     mitigation and preparedness activities, and maintain unit continuity for command and
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                      7


   control. UCC/GCCs support the installation commander and EOC by providing subject-
   matter-experts and resources.
2.5. Personnel Control Center (PCC). The PCC is manned by the 30th Force Support
Squadron Installation Personnel Readiness (30 FSS/IPR) and is responsible for reporting
personnel strength and accountability to the 30 SW/CP. Once the Wing/CC initiates a recall the
30 FSS/IPR becomes the PCC and is responsible for overall management of the wing personnel
strength/accountability reporting system.
2.6. 30th Space Wing Public Affairs (PA). PA is responsible for radio/television and “Hot
Launch” broadcasting of alert notification messages, as directed by the 30 SW/CC or designated
representative.
2.7. BDOC. When an alert notification is initiated and base communications are impaired,
Comm-Out notifications will be implemented. The 30 SW/CP will attempt contact with the
BDOC by any means available and request their assistance in implementing the pyramid recall
and alert notification. The BDOC will dispatch a patrol to notify wing/group commanders
2.8. 30th Space Communications Squadron (SCS). SCS will serve as the AtHoc INWS
maintenance, communications focal point, training, and technical support. SCS will:
   2.8.1. Provide user technical support of the AtHoc and coordinate with the AtHoc contractor
   to provide training for users as required.
   2.8.2. Maintain operational capability of the AtHoc system, to include performing system
   and server hardware/software upgrades, keeping the system current with security software
   patches and Notices To Airmen (NOTAMs), and performing server and database
   maintenance and anomaly resolution.
2.9. Emergency Response. Although primary responsibility for reporting events and incidents
rests with the 30 SW/CP and other 24-hour operations centers, all personnel will ensure
emergency response elements and their command chain are informed of significant events. If
there is a question, report the incident. Do not delay emergency notifications.
   2.9.1. Personnel (Active Duty, selected Reserve, DAF and NAF Civilians, and Contractors)
   will contact their leadership and keep them informed of their location and account for family
   members.
   2.9.2. All personnel are responsible to acknowledge and comply with all alert notifications.
   Acknowledgement instructions will be provided in each message.

                                             Chapter 3

                                          DEFINITIONS

3.1. Alert Notification Types.
     3.1.1. Report for Duty Recall. Used to immediately recall to duty all or a select number or
     category (i.e., military, civilian, mission-essential) of personnel. Unit strength reporting is
     required. Pertinent information will be passed including Reference Hour.
        3.1.1.1. The urgent nature of a recall requires all affected personnel to immediately
        report to their assigned duty section in uniform unless otherwise directed. Personnel will
        complete their pyramid alert notifications and not delay for personal grooming
        (showering, shaving, etc.) or eating.
        3.1.1.2. During exercises, personnel on non-duty status, such as leave, crew rest and
        temporary duty, are not normally recalled to duty. Non-duty Individual Mobilization
        Augmentees (IMA) are not normally recalled for exercises. Shift workers will be
        contacted at the discretion of the commander.
     3.1.2. Crisis Action Team Recall. This is used to account for Crisis Action Team personnel
     during real-world or exercise situations. When contacted, the Crisis Action Team will form
     as directed. Pertinent information will be passed, including the Reference Hour.
     3.1.3. Telephone Standby. This is used to quickly relay time-critical information to the
     base populace. Personnel should be immediately available to receive information or
     instructions by telephone, cellular phone, Blackberry, e-mail or similar device. Reference
     hour may or may not be required.
        3.1.3.1. Personnel will complete their pyramid recall and must remain available to be
        contacted by one of these means of communications while telephone standby is in effect
        and be readily available to be recalled until released. It is each individual’s responsibility
        to inform their supervisor and/or work center of their means of contact at all times.
        3.1.3.2. Messages left on voice mail or answering machines do not constitute contact.
        However, for civilian employees, this is equivalent to “on-call” status.
     3.1.4. Notification Advisory. This is used to disseminate time-critical instructions and
     other information of any nature deemed appropriate by the 30 SW/CC. All personnel will be
     contacted for these notifications. Situations requiring these notifications may include, but are
     not limited to, accountability reporting, release from telephone standby, delayed reporting,
     base closure, local emergency, or security condition requiring immediate notification of
     personnel. A Reference Hour may or may not be established. Personnel must copy and relay
     special notifications completely and correctly and complete their pyramid alert notifications.
     3.1.5. Tests. All assigned personnel will be contacted as required (except those personnel
     on leave, TDY status, or on crew rest). Testing of the alert notification system is normally
     associated with base or installation (including tenant units) exercises or as directed by the
     30 SW/CC. Units will comply and respond with real-world urgency. Units are encouraged
     to test their pyramid alert notification procedures frequently.
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                        9


   3.1.6. Comm-Out Recall. Used when normal communications methods are unavailable.
   The 30 SW/CC will designate a Comm-Out recall when the wing sustains an overall
   communications failure or if the nature of the threat and need for security dictate. Units will
   establish Comm-Out procedures that coincide with their recall rosters and in accordance with
   Section 3.5. of this instruction.
3.2. Alert Notification Methods. Personnel normally receive alert notifications from their
chain of command.
   3.2.1. Unit commanders receive notifications from AtHoc via desk top pop-up, telephone, or
   email. Unit commanders will pass notifications via pyramid alert.
   3.2.2. If the telephone system is inoperable, or when directed, the Comm-Out recall and
   notification process will be initiated and runners will be utilized.
   3.2.3. As directed by the 30 SW/CC, PA will notify radio and television stations to broadcast
   the applicable notification message. Press releases will be made through PA only.
3.3. Civilian Employees. Unit commanders will recall civilian employees at their discretion
based on the situation and mission requirements.
   3.3.1. Unit commanders will identify and maintain status of civilian personnel and ensure
   they are properly identified on recall rosters and notified during recalls. Civilian employees
   will be clearly delineated on recall rosters to eliminate confusion with military members and
   will be easily identifiable by special marking (asterisk, ampersand, etc.).
   3.3.2. Contractors must be identified as essential for operations through their contract or
   statement of work in order to be recalled.
3.4. Crew Rest. Personnel on crew rest are not normally subject to recall, however, they may
be recalled in the event of an emergency. Personnel are considered on crew rest if they are the
on-coming or off-going shift. Supervisors will recall non-alert shift workers based on mission
need and impact.
   3.4.1. Off-going Crews. For crews working 8-hour shifts, the first 8 hours after the shift is
   considered crew rest. For crews working 12-hour shifts, the first 12 hours after the shift is
   considered crew rest.
   3.4.2. On-coming Crews. For crews working 8-hour shifts, the first 8 hours before the shift
   is considered crew rest. For crews working 12-hour shifts, the first 12 hours before the shift
   is considered crew rest.
   3.4.3. Certified mission-ready personnel on crew rest are not normally subject to recall,
   however, they may be recalled in the event of an emergency. Crew rest is waived and all
   personnel must respond if there is a national emergency recall.
   3.4.4. At all other times, personnel are "off" and subject to recall.
3.5. Recall Rosters. The term "recall rosters" and/or "rosters" pertain to all alert notification
types of rosters. Units will develop and maintain a recall roster that includes both
communications-in (Comm-In) and Comm-Out formats and instructions.
   3.5.1. Recall Roster Organization.
10                                                              30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013


     3.5.1.1. Units will organize rosters as needed to meet unit requirements. Attachment 2
     contains detailed recall roster instructions.
     3.5.1.2. Comm-In recall rosters will be organized in a logical sequence with key
     personnel (or individuals who collect and report status) notified first. Whenever possible,
     consolidate individual offices into a broader system to increase the speed of notifications.
     3.5.1.3. Comm-Out recall rosters should be grouped logically according to geographic
     areas to facilitate quickest possible notifications. When possible, on-base personnel will
     be contacted first, then notifications will expand to the surrounding communities. The
     Comm-Out pyramid roster should be well organized and not copy the Comm-In roster.
  3.5.2. Recall roster contents will comply with Attachment 2 of this instruction.
     3.5.2.1. Specify format as Comm-In or Comm-Out.
     3.5.2.2. All rosters are required to have alert notification procedures IAW Section 5 and
     strength/accountability reporting procedures IAW Section 6.
     3.5.2.3. A special symbol (i.e., $, #) will be used to differentiate between military,
     civilian, or task force personnel. Members of the Crisis Action Team (CAT) will be
     identified with a separate special symbol.
  3.5.3. Roster Distribution. Each unit commander/agency chief will send a copy of the recall
  roster to each unit/agency above them in the chain of command. No later than the 5th of each
  month, Vandenberg AFB units, including all tenant units, will provide 30 SW/CP a copy of
  their current unit recall roster by unclassified e-mail. Send to: 30SW.CP@us.af.mil.
  3.5.4. Due to the privacy of the information, recall rosters must be encrypted and outdated
  hardcopies must be shredded
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                        11


                                            Chapter 4

                                        PROCEDURES

4.1. Emergency Procedures. Alert notifications will be accomplished only after emergency
responder notifications have been accomplished (i.e., Fire Department, Medical, Security Forces,
etc.).
   4.1.1. 30 SW/CP. The 30 SW/CP will notify, at a minimum, the 30 SW/CC, vice wing
   commander (30 SW/CV), wing command chief ( 30 SW/CCC), and group/tenant unit
   commanders for each alert notification. The 30 SW/CP controllers will make no more than
   20 notifications (10 per controller) to prevent the delay in the alert notification process.
   4.1.2. Group/tenant unit commanders/agency chiefs.             Alert notifications will be
   accomplished for their respective units/agencies, to include contractors which operate under
   that unit, if required. UCC/GCCs will not be tasked with more than 10 notifications per
   person.
   4.1.3. CAT. When an alert notification is directed and the CAT is already formed, the CAT
   Team Chief/members will initiate alert notifications for their individual units. CAT Team
   Chief/members will relay notifications/information through the 30 SW/CP liaison, which is
   normally the 30 SW/CP Chief.
4.2. Loss of Communications.
   4.2.1. Impaired Communications. When an alert notification is initiated and base
   communications are impaired, the 30 SW/CP will attempt contact with the BDOC by any
   means available and request their assistance in implementing the pyramid recall and alert
   notification. The BDOC will dispatch a patrol to notify wing/group commanders.
   4.2.2. Communications Outage. Each unit will develop alert notification procedures to use
   in the event of a communications outage. Refer to Section 3.5. of this instruction.
4.3. Training. Unit commanders/agency chiefs must be familiar with wing operational plans
and/or situations that require alert notifications. Unit personnel must be trained on alert
notification procedures. Units are authorized and encouraged to test procedures at the discretion
of the unit commander. Unit commanders are advised to coordinate tests with 30 SW/IGI to
ensure there are no conflicts with base-wide exercises already planned.
4.4. Exercises. Installation-wide alert notifications in support of a base exercise will be
coordinated with 30 SW/IGI and approved by the 30 SW/CC. 30 SW/IGI conducts periodic,
base-wide exercises in which the alert notification system is tested. Recalls used in support of an
exercise frequently require real-world actions or responses from various base personnel and units
must maintain a sense of urgency.
4.5. Commander’s Availability. 30 SW/CP should be able to contact group commanders
within 15 minutes. Therefore, it is incumbent upon all group commanders to notify 30 SW/CP
when they are not reachable. In those instances, group commanders should provide 30 SW/CP
an alternate point of contact (POC) for their unit. 30 SW/CP will attempt contact with the deputy
commander, or designated alternate, if the group commander is unreachable and there is no
alternate provided.
 12                                                              30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013


                                           Chapter 5

                         ALERT NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES

5.1. The 30 SW/CP will initiate alert notifications and relay the appropriate message as
described in Attachment 3.
5.2. AtHoc Alert Notification Sequence. Personnel are responsible for receiving,
acknowledging, and complying with any notification received via the AtHoc system. Questions
concerning notification information contained in an AtHoc message should be addressed to their
chain of command.
5.3. Pyramid Alert Notification Sequence. This section outlines recommended procedures,
however commanders may have discretion to authorize changes in implementation, dependent on
unit size and efficiency.
   5.3.1. Personnel responsible for initiating contact to multiple columns on a recall roster will
   contact the first individual in each column and relay the information verbatim using the
   formats and instructions contained in Attachment 3. If the first person is not available, the
   initiating caller is responsible for calling subsequent personnel in that column until actual
   contact is made.
   5.3.2. Leaving a message on an answering machine or leaving a voicemail does not
   constitute contact, however leaving the information is required.
   5.3.3. Attempts to re-contact personnel must be made expeditiously until contact is made.
   Personnel in “other” status (TDY, leave, hospital/quarters, shift workers, prisoner,
   correctional custody, etc.) must be accounted for. This precludes a break in the pyramid if an
   individual cannot be contacted.
   5.3.4. Individuals not contacted must be reported as “no-contact” and will not be considered
   accounted for. “No contact made” and “other” status will be passed from individual to
   individual as the recall progresses.
   5.3.5. The final individual in each column to receive contact will report accountability of
   their column to the person who initiated contact.
   5.3.6. Unit commanders/agency chiefs must notify their subordinate commanders and other
   organizations as directed by this instruction.
5.4. Response. Personnel will respond in accordance with the instructions provided. Unit
commanders/agency chiefs and supervisors must ensure proper response and exercise discretion
when shift workers are involved or when other circumstances preclude contact or reporting of
personnel. Refer to paragraph 3.4. for crew rest restrictions.
5.5. CAT. When the CAT is recalled, personnel will report as required. After the situation is
briefed, the battle rhythm will be established. For tenant units not present in the CAT, the CAT
Team Chief will advise 30 SW/CP which units to notify.
5.6. 14 AF. The 30 SW/CP will support/conduct alert notifications for the 14th Air Force
Commander (14 AF/CC) when directed by the 30 SW/CC.
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                      13


5.7. New START Treaty (NST) Inspection Notifications. Selected Vandenberg AFB
personnel will be notified of a NST Inspection declaration and termination via senior staff
notifications from the 30 SW/CP when requested by the 30 SW Treaty Office.
5.8. Contractor Alert Notifications. With the high degree of contractor cooperation required
to accomplish Vandenberg’s mission, it is incumbent upon program managers, contracting
officers, customers, and building managers to ensure that contractors are aware of Vandenberg’s
current readiness status. Additionally, they must be informed of any emergency/disaster
situation or general advisory affecting Vandenberg AFB. Unit commanders, with operational
control of the contract, will ensure notifications are made as applicable.
5.9. Readiness Condition (REDCON) Notifications. Changes in real-world or exercise
REDCON status are classified SECRET. The 30 SW/CC will direct the base to assume the
appropriate REDCON via secure means as directed by higher headquarters. Unit/agency points
of contact/UCCs/GCCs will collect and consolidate attainment data for their respective units and
report attainment to the 30 SW/CP via secure means. When the CAT is formed, attainment
status will flow from the UCC/GCC to the CAT.
5.10. Defense Condition (DEFCON) Notifications. Changes in real-world or exercise
DEFCON status are classified SECRET. The 30 SW/CC will direct the base to assume the
appropriate DEFCON via secure means as directed by higher headquarters. Unit/agency points
of contact/UCC/GCC will collect and consolidate attainment data for their respective units and
report attainment to the 30 SW/CP via secure means. When the CAT is formed, attainment
status will flow from the UCC/GCC to the CAT.
5.11. Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Notifications. The 30 SW/CC will direct the base
to implement the appropriate FPCON through the 30 SW/CP. Unit/agency points of
contact/UCC/GCC will collect and consolidate attainment data for their respective units and
report attainment to the 30 SW/CP. When the CAT is formed, attainment status will flow from
the UCC/GCC to the CAT.
5.12. Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) Notifications. The 30 SW/CC will
direct the Information Assurance Officer (IAO) and 30 SW/CP to implement the appropriate
INFOCON. The IAO will notify unit client system administrators (CSA) to initiate INFOCON
changes, who will report attainment back to the IAO. The IAO reports wing attainment to the
30 SW/CP.
5.13. Incident Notifications. The 30 SW/CP should be notified immediately of any incident
that has the potential to generate Wing, Numbered Air Force, Major Command, or Headquarters
Air Force leadership interest, or local or national media interest. These include mission
degradation or loss due to hostile acts, mishaps, accidents, or natural disasters and events
involving personnel death, serious injury or illness, assault, or hate crimes. A complete list of
reportable items can be found in AFI 10-206/AFSPC Supplement, AFSPC CCIR Reporting
Matrix.

                                          Chapter 6

 STRENGTH REPORTING, ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTING AND ATTAINMENT
                          PROCESS.

6.1. Unit Control Center/Group Control Center. A UCC/GCC is the agency designated by
each squadron/group for disseminating critical information for that unit. The UCC/GCC is also
responsible for strength/accountability reporting.
   6.1.1. All group/tenant/unit commanders are responsible in appointing monitors to fulfill the
   reporting requirements for strength/accountability reporting. Monitors will receive training
   within 60 days of appointment.
   6.1.2. The organizations listed below identify the UCC/GCC. Each UCC will record
   strength/accountability reports from within their units and update the information on the
   Wing Recall Management database. Refer to Attachment 7 for a comprehensive list of
   UCC/GCC and the units under them.
       6.1.2.1. 30 Comptroller Squadron/Wing Staff Agencies
       6.1.2.2. 30th Operations Group
       6.1.2.3. 30th Launch Group
       6.1.2.4. 30th Medical Group
       6.1.2.5. 30th Mission Support Group
       6.1.2.6. 30th Civil Engineer Squadron
       6.1.2.7. 30th Force Support Squadron
       6.1.2.8. 30th Logistics Readiness Squadron
       6.1.2.9. 30th Security Forces Squadron
       6.1.2.10. National Reconnaissance Office
       6.1.2.11. AF Fuels Lab
       6.1.2.12. 381st Training Group
       6.1.2.13. 576th Flight Test Squadron
       6.1.2.14. 21st Space Operations Squadron
       6.1.2.15. 14th Air Force
       6.1.2.16. 17 TS Det 3, OL-A
       6.1.2.17. AFMC 581 MMXS/MXOPH
6.2. PCC. The Military Personnel Section Chief is the wing POC for establishing and running
the PCC and designates sufficient primary and alternate personnel to fully man the PCC during
recalls, alerts, and exercise alerts.
6.3. Alternate PCC. In the event the primary PCC cannot be reached by phone, attempt to
contact the Alternate PCC (determined at time of time activation). If there is no answer, assume
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                           15


a communications outage and dispatch a runner to the primary PCC to report
strength/accountability data. If the primary PCC has been destroyed or evacuated, the runner
will report to the alternate PCC. During PCC relocation, PCC personnel will dispatch a runner to
the 30 SW/CP to report wing strength/accountability. The PCC will ensure UCC/GCC and
30 SW/CP controllers are notified of its operating location.
6.4. Air Force Personnel Center/Personnel Readiness Center (AFPC/PRC). When there is
an emergency, natural disaster, or crisis situation, the AFPC/PRC is activated and will run a 24-
hour operation (if the situation deems it necessary) in order to provide prompt, timely actions
concerning Air Force personnel. It also functions as the AFPC/PRC POC between HQ USAF,
MAJCOMs, direct reporting units, and other field operating agencies.
   6.4.1. The AFPC/PRC monitors and anticipates changes to personnel programs, policies, and
   procedures as they relate to the crisis.
   6.4.2. The AFPC/PRC serves as a focal point for commanders in the event personnel are
   evacuated and communications have been damaged or impaired. In these situations, the
   AFPC/PRC acts as a central POC to pass on information from an installation's command
   authority to its personnel.
   6.4.3. In order for the AFPC/PRC to account for all Air Force personnel, when evacuated,
   personnel should notify either their unit POC (if designated) or contact the AFPC/PRC at 1-
   800-435-9941.
6.5. Strength Reporting Process. This process will start with a message to the unit
commander. Strength reporting is the process of recording and reporting the total number of
personnel available to react to a recall, to sustain the mission in response to a given situation, and
takes into account personnel on leave, TDY, or crew rest, and applies only to military personnel
and mission essential civilians.
   6.5.1. Each unit is responsible for collecting internal strength reports and passing that
   information to their respective UCC/GCC. The UCC/GCC will collect all respective unit
   reports and update the Wing Recall Management database via the 30 SW SharePoint site.
   Refer to Section 6.7.
   6.5.2. During times requiring strength reports, PCC personnel are considered deployed-in-
   place, are tasked with collecting strength reports, and are on-call 24/7 during the operation.
   Units will consider a process utilizing runners to update accountability to the PCC during a
   Comm-out recall.
   6.5.3. Strength reports are made available to the 30 SW/CP.
6.6. TFA Reporting Process. TFA reporting is the process of recording and reporting the total
number of personnel (including military dependents as accounted in DEERS and AF civilian
employees) for safety of the Vandenberg populace during an emergency situation and takes into
account personnel on leave, TDY, or crew rest. This applies to Vandenberg personnel only.
   6.6.1. Each unit is responsible for collecting internal accountability reports and passing that
   information to their respective UCC/GCC. The UCC/GCC collect all respective unit reports
   and update the Wing Recall Management SharePoint site. Refer to paragraph 6.7.
 16                                                             30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013


   6.6.2. During times requiring accountability reports, PCC personnel are considered
   deployed-in-place, are tasked with collecting accountability reports, and are on-call 24/7
   during the operation. Accountability reports are made available to the 30 SW/CP.
   6.6.3. Accountability reporting applies to Active Duty Air Force, Air National Guard, Air
   Force Reserve, and Air Force Individual Ready Reserve personnel assigned to the 30 SW and
   to any tenant unit on Vandenberg AFB and their family members who are enrolled in
   DEERS and physically residing in the area of concern.
      6.6.3.1. Military personnel will account for dependents listed in DEERS, when required.
      6.6.3.2. A military member is not included in the accountability report as “accounted
      for” until ALL of their dependents are accounted for.
   6.6.4. Civilian personnel. Civilian personnel assigned to the 30 SW or to any tenant unit on
   Vandenberg AFB and their family members who are actively enrolled in DEERS and
   physically residing in the area of concern or when receiving evacuation entitlements.
   6.6.5. Guidance applies to any personnel listed in paragraphs 6.6.3. and 6.6.4. of this
   instruction who are on TDY, leave, or pass.
6.7. Attainment Reporting Process. The attainment process will continue until 100%
strength/accountability has been reached.
   6.7.1. TFA will be attained by using the Wing Recall Management database via the
   30 SW SharePoint site.
      6.7.1.1. The UCC/GCC will forward current appointment letters for their representatives
      to 30 FSS/FSOX, to receive training and gain the appropriate access.
      6.7.1.2. The accountability process is available online, only Vandenberg personnel (with
      network access) will be able to view the database. Access will be provided to those
      personnel that are appointed by their respective squadron/group commanders.
      6.7.1.3. During Comm-out procedures, units will complete the “Unit Recall
      Strength/Accountability Worksheet”. Refer to Attachment 5.
   6.7.2. The UCC/GCC will utilize local reports and tools (Alpha Roster, Sign-In Sheet,
   Recall Roster, BLSDM, etc.) to attain accountability. The UCC/GCC will make updates
   under the “Recall Accountability” section of the Wing Recall Management homepage and
   track their unit’s accountability. The GCC will follow these steps to track their subordinate
   UCCs:
      6.7.2.1. Locate Wing Recall Management home page
      6.7.2.2. Select “Recall Accountability”
      6.7.2.3. Scroll right, select the “All Items” drop down menu
      6.7.2.4. Select appropriate group view (e.g., “MSG View”)
      6.7.2.5. View the Sum of each category (e.g., Total Assigned, Present for Duty, etc.)
      6.7.2.6. Transcribe to the appropriate group on the Wing Recall Management home page
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                     17


   6.7.3. The UCC/GCC will initially report accountability via SharePoint no later than
   90 minutes after the Reference Hour. Accountability will be continuously updated until all
   units are at 100%”.
   6.7.4. The 30 SW/CP will review installation TFA reports via the Wing Recall Management
   database until 100% accountability or until instructed to terminate reporting by the 30
   SW/CC.
6.8. Wide Spread Catastrophic Events. The Air Force Personnel Accountability and
Assessment System (AFPAAS) will be used to account for personnel during a wide-spread
catastrophic event at the direction of Headquarters Air Force.
   6.8.1. Once a member (or family member if evacuating separately) has arrived at a safe
   evacuation location, their first act should be to report their status and location via AFPAAS
   or other means.
   6.8.2. If a member is unable to either update AFPAAS, or contact their UCC/GCC they
   should immediately contact the AFPC/PRC at 1-800-435-9941 to report their whereabouts.
   AFPC/PRC is manned 24/7 to respond to any emergency.
   6.8.3. In the event a member is stranded in a crisis area with no communications available,
   members are encouraged to report their status to any responding agency (Red Cross, local
   police, Federal Emergency Management Agency, etc.) and ask that agency to report the
   status of the member to the Air Force through any means available.
6.9. Readiness Attainment Reporting Process. Readiness attainment reporting is the process
of ensuring all necessary actions are taken in response to changes in readiness (i.e., FPCON
changes). This includes, but is not limited to, posturing of personnel and/or equipment,
implementing Random Anti-Terrorism Measures, and updating readiness status displays. Unit
commanders must ensure all assigned personnel are notified of alert notification information.
Each unit will develop and incorporate procedures on respective recall rosters to ensure all
personnel are notified of changes in readiness status. UCC/GCC will report attainment of
readiness changes to 30 SW/CP. Units will immediately notify 30 SW/CP if projected
milestones cannot be completed.

       DISASTER NOTIFICATIONS - SECONDARY CRASH NETWORK (SCN)

7.1. The SCN is a direct-line telephone notification system used for base emergencies and is
limited to agencies requiring emergency action/response to flight line-related
incidents/mishaps. The SCN will only be used to relay information critical to aircraft and
airfield operations (e.g. in-flight emergencies, ground emergencies, FPCON level changes, EOC
activations/recalls, bomb threats, or terrorist activities).
7.2. AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, governs the structure and use for the SCN. The 30
OSS/OSA, Airfield Operations Flight, is the OPR for the SCN. During airfield operating hours,
Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) activates the SCN for those situations initiated by
the Primary Crash Network.
   7.2.1. The EOC Director may direct AMOPS or CP to activate the SCN due to an emergency
   situation requiring notification of SCN participants.
   7.2.2. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) authorizes 30 SW/CP to act as an activating
   agency for the SCN because AMOPS is not a 24-hour work center. The 30 SW/CP has sole
   authority to activate the SCN when AMOPS is closed. During duty hours, 30 SW/CP will
   contact AMOPS for permission to activate the SCN, at the request of the 30 SW/CC or the
   EOC Director, for any reason. The MOA also authorizes the 30 SW/CP to activate the SCN
   for any requirement outlined in the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP)
   10-2.
7.3. Operation. If AMOPS or 30 SW/CP’s equipment is inoperable, they will direct the other
agency to activate the net. If the SCN is inoperable, the Alternate SCN will be activated by
calling 606-2700 via land line or Internet Phone System.
   7.3.1. AMOPS has the authority to interrupt or preempt other usage of the SCN should an
   aircraft emergency occur.
   7.3.2. Personnel on duty in each agency equipped with an SCN will immediately answer the
   SCN. Agencies will remain on the line until released by the AMOPS or 30 SW/CP. After
   the second transmission of the message, the AMOPS or 30 SW/CP will release those stations
   in receipt of a complete message. Stations having questions will remain on the line and ask
   questions after all agencies have been polled.
   7.3.3. Upon receipt of an SCN notification, agencies will accomplish required actions as
   directed.
   7.3.4. Message Formats and Checklists Procedures. Message formats are provided in
   Attachment 6. Agencies will use these message formats for receiving an SCN message. Use
   of unformatted instructions must be consistent with the intent of AFI 13-213.
7.4. Disaster Alert. 30 SW/CP, at the request of the 30 SW/CC or the EOC Director, will
activate the SCN for any requirement outlined in the CEMP 10-2. See Attachment 4 for
guidance regarding personnel accountability following natural disasters or national emergencies.
7.5. Alert Sirens. The 30 SW/CP tests the alert sirens every Friday at 1200L. During these
tests, the 30 SW/CP coordinates with the BDOC and facilities close to the sirens in advance so
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                     19


patrols and personnel in the facilities can monitor selected sirens and report results to the 30
SW/CP.

       ATHOC - INSTALLATION NOTIFICATION WARNING SYSTEM (INWS)

8.1. Description: The AtHoc INWS (Telecommunication Notifications System) is a computer-
based communication system designed to transmit computer-generated alert notifications to all
Vandenberg AFB personnel in an expeditious manner via desk-top computer pop-up banners,
home/work emails, and home/work/mobile telephones. It is not designed, nor does it have the
capacity, to replace manual recall procedures.
   8.1.1. The most valuable feature of the AtHoc system is its capability to rapidly transmit
   desktop computer and email alert notifications informing all Vandenberg AFB personnel of
   emergency situations or advisories in time to take appropriate protective measures.
   8.1.2. The AtHoc system relies on a limited number of telephone “lease” lines which
   prevents rapid telephonic notification. Alert notifications sent to land-line and mobile
   telephones may take up to four hours to reach all recipients. Additionally, each telephonic
   message is charged a fee per call.
8.2. Purpose: The purpose of this system is to provide the initial framework for a mass
notification system.
   8.2.1. Wing Level Usage. The 30 SW/CP and EOC are designated wing level users for all
   AtHoc notifications. All wing level notifications require approval from 30 SW/CC/CV,
   designated representative, or EOC Director.
   8.2.2. When 30 SW/CP initiates an actual/exercise Report for Duty or Accountability recall,
   30 SW/CP controllers will transmit the AtHoc message to the appropriate commanders and
   all Vandenberg AFB tenant unit commanders. Those personnel are responsible to implement
   locally developed unit recall procedures.
8.3. Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. Unit commanders/agency chiefs. Unit commanders/agency chiefs will develop a
   process on their unit in/out-processing checklist to add/delete individuals in the AtHoc
   system when user e-mail accounts are created.
       8.3.1.1. Will ensure personnel assigned to static distribution lists (i.e. EOC, UCC, SFS
       Augmentee) update their status by checking the applicable block on the Purple Globe.
   8.3.2. 30 SCS. The 30 SCS is the AtHoc System Maintainer (SCS SM) and act as a
   communication focal point.
       8.3.2.1. The SCS SM will assist 30 SW/CP, EOC, FSS, and OSS users with AtHoc use
       and configuration anomaly resolution and escalate to the vendor as required.
       8.3.2.2. The SCS SM will assist all users with any Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
       and Privacy Act related issues.
       8.3.2.3. The SCS SM will provide operational training for 30 SW/CP, EOC, FSS, and
       OSS users.
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                   21


  8.3.3. 30 SW/CP. 30 SW/CP is a primary user and publisher in the AtHoc notification
  system and is responsible for making alert notifications as directed by the 30 SW/CC/CV or
  designated representative. The 30 SW/CP will:
     8.3.3.1. Have the highest priority (high) on the AtHoc system and take precedence over
     all other notifications for 30 SW/CP-initiated recalls/notifications. 30 SW/CP may
     override current alerts with wing-wide alerts.
     8.3.3.2. Develop, publish, and maintain scenario publishing and distribution lists for 30
     SW/CP’s scenarios and lists only, as required. At a minimum, the 30 SW/CP will
     maintain the Commander’s List for 30 SW and tenant commanders.
     8.3.3.3. Test the capabilities of the Alert Notification System on a weekly basis.
     8.3.3.4. Coordinate with SCS SM to obtain necessary AtHoc System operational
     training.
  8.3.4. EOC. The EOC is a primary user and publisher in the AtHoc notification system and
  is responsible for making alert notifications as directed by the EOC Director, or designated
  alternate.
     8.3.4.1. EOC-initiated notifications have the second highest priority (medium) on the
     AtHoc system.
     8.3.4.2. Develop, publish, and maintain scenario publishing and distribution lists for
     EOC scenarios and lists only, as required. EOC will maintain the EOC POC Distribution
     List.
     8.3.4.3. Coordinate with SCS SM to obtain necessary AtHoc System operational
     training.
  8.3.5. 30th Force Support Squadron (FSS). FSS is a user of the AtHoc notification
  system.
     8.3.5.1. FSS will maintain the UCC Distribution List.
     8.3.5.2. Coordinate with SCS SM to obtain necessary AtHoc System operational
     training.
  8.3.6. 30th Operations Support Squadron (OSS). OSS is a user of the AtHoc notification
  system.
     8.3.6.1. At a minimum, the OSS will maintain the CAT Distribution List.
     8.3.6.2. Coordinate with SCS to obtain necessary AtHoc System operational training.
  8.3.7. 30 SW/CP, EOC, FSS, and OSS will:
     8.3.7.1. Obtain and track initial/refresher training for their respective AtHoc
     POC’s/users.
     8.3.7.2. Provide all AtHoc POC’s/users with example checklists for AtHoc usage.
     AtHoc POC’s/users may make changes to the checklist to meet their requirements.
     8.3.7.3. Perform necessary filter, scenario, publishing, reports and user group build
     activities as required.
 22                                                              30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013


       8.3.7.4. Strictly limit access to Privacy Act information contained within the AtHoc
       system to authorized personnel. Access will be allowed with strict adherence to military
       operations ‘need-to-know’ criteria IAW with policy in AFI 36-3803 and AFI 10-2501,
       Air Force Emergency Management Planning and Management. The addition of new
       fields associated with personnel identification will be coordinated with 30 SCS to ensure
       compliance with FOIA guidelines.
       8.3.7.5. Reports generated with Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the AtHoc
       system will only be reviewed by BDOC, IG, 30 SW/CP personnel, and applicable wing
       leadership. Once PII is no longer required, it will be shredded/deleted.
   8.3.8. CSA: Unit CSA’s are responsible to assist individual users with Purple Globe
   procedures. When technical assistance is required, the unit CSA’s should contact the
   Network Control Center for assistance.
8.4. Individual Personnel.
   8.4.1. To enter/change personal contact information, log onto a computer of the 30 SW local
   area network.
   8.4.2. Right click on the Purple Globe in the “Notifications Area” of the lower Taskbar
   (bottom right area displaying the time and date), then select “Access Self Service”.
   8.4.3. Update the required information under the “My Info” and “My Contact Info” tabs.
       8.4.3.1. If you are assigned to a specialty team (i.e., CAT, EOC, SFS Augmentee, X-37B
       Standby), ensure the appropriate block is selected in the “My Info” tab.
       8.4.3.2. Click “Save” on each tab to save information prior to moving to the next tab.
       8.4.3.3. If personnel only have a cell phone, that number should only be entered into the
       “Cell” phone block. Do not enter the same phone number in both the “Home” and “Cell”
       blocks.
8.5. System Operation. Because of the high costs associated with AtHoc telephonic
notifications, AtHoc messages addressed to all Vandenberg AFB personnel using all three
transmission modes (i.e., computer, email, and telephone), must be approved by the 30 SW/CC
prior to transmission.
   8.5.1. Due to the time-sensitive nature of emergency alert notifications (e.g., major accident,
   natural disaster), alert notification messages sent via computer pop-up and email do not
   require 30 SW/CC approval prior to transmission. AtHoc message transmission approval
   authorities are as follows: 30 SW/CC or designated representative(s) or EOC Director.
   8.5.2. System operators will strictly limit access to Privacy Act information contained within
   the AtHoc system to authorized personnel and will be coordinated with SCS to ensure
   compliance with FOIA guidelines. Reports generated with PII from the AtHoc system will
   only be reviewed by applicable wing leadership and will be shredded/deleted upon
   completion of need.
   8.5.3. The 30 SW will fund the necessary system upgrades and fund follow-on O&M
   upgrades/modifications. The 30th Mission Support Group will purchase additional phone
   minutes as required for alert recalls that exhaust off-base local exchange carrier costs.
30SWI36-3803 17 MAY 2013                                                                  23


8.6. AtHoc Alert Notification Methods.
   8.6.1. Desk-top pop-up. When on a computer desktop connected to the 30 SW local area
   network, a window pop-up may/may not request a response prior to acknowledgement. For
   system testing purposes only, pop-ups will require a response or acknowledgement.
   8.6.2. Telephone Notification. An automated phone call from the AtHoc system sent to duty
   phone, home phone, or cellular phone. For system testing purposes only, telephone
   notifications will be directed to the duty phone.
   8.6.3. E-mail Notification. An automated email from the AtHoc system sent to either duty
   email or home email address. For system testing purposes only, email notifications will be
   directed to the duty email address.
   8.6.4. Short Message Service (SMS) Notification. SMS is a text messaging service
   component of phone, web, or mobile communication systems and will not be used.

      PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY FOLLOWING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
                      NATIONAL EMERGENCIES

A4.1. 30 SW/CC shall initiate an total accountability recall during and/or following a natural
disaster or national emergency as deemed necessary to account for all active duty, civilians, Non-
Appropriated Fund employees and dependents.
A4.2. Once the Wing/CC initiates a recall the 30th Force Support Squadron Installation
Personnel Readiness (30 FSS/IPR) becomes the Personnel Control Center (PCC) and is
responsible for overall management of the wing personnel strength/accountability reporting
system.
A4.3. Military and civilian members contacted shall be asked about the status of their
dependents as applicable. Accountability for all members shall be reported by UCCs IAW
existing alert notification procedures with the addition of reporting numbers of missing active
duty dependents. In the event the sponsor is away from home station, UCCs will contact the
sponsor’s dependents to ascertain their status and report it accordingly if a dependent is missing.
A4.4. All 30 SW and tenant unit organizations will gather and maintain home addresses and
phone numbers on all civilians and NAF employees assigned to their units. This information
will be safeguarded for official use only and maintained by only those with a need to have the
information such as section chiefs, UCCs, unit Commanders, etc. When directed, UCCs will use
this information to contact their civilians and report accountability to the PCC using the reporting
tool described in paragraph A4.8.
A4.5. Federal Employees may be contacted during an alert notification, but will not report
outside of normal work schedules unless a commander or supervisor deems them essential for
providing a particular response capability. Contractors must be identified as essential for
operations through their contract or statement of work to be recalled.
A4.6. When unable to make contact with an individual, identify personnel not contacted to the
commander/UCC initiating the recall.
A4.7. UCCs are responsible for knowing TDY and leave locations and valid contact information
of unit members. Units will report status to UCCs.
A4.8. If already formed, the CAT will initiate recall of all subordinate units and staffs. Recall
status of 30 SW geographically separated units (GSU) is the responsibility of the CAT.
A4.9. The 30 SW UCCs will accomplish strength/accountability reporting using Wing
Recall Management Database.
A4.10. Unit commanders will ensure unit strength/accountability statistics are up-channeled to
the PCC. GSUs will send their data to the CAT which will then forward it to the PCC.
A4.11. GCCs/UCCs will use the reporting process outlined in Attachment 5. The 30 SW is
expected to achieve 100% accountability no later than Recall Hour +6 hours.
