Terms
Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL)â€”Refers to measurement standards and
TMDE, professional and technical metrologists, performing work centers, a system of worldwide
laboratory facilities, TMDE users, calibration data, and integrated planning. The program
provides for maintenance and calibration of TMDE to verify the reliability and ensure the
accuracy of systems, subsystems, and equipment.
Air Force Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL)â€”The highest level calibration standards
laboratory in the AFMETCAL Program. It maintains Air Force measurement standards certified
by the NIST or other nationally recognized standards. The AFPSL (located at Heath, Ohio) uses
these measurement standards to calibrate base level or PMEL measurement standards and
equipment for Air Force customers.
Alignmentâ€”The physical, electrical, or software action that enables a calibration technician to
adjust TMDE so that performance will be within required operational parameters/accuracies.
Calibrationâ€”A comparison between equipment items, one of which is a measurement standard
of known accuracy, to detect, correlate, adjust and report any variations in the accuracy of the
other item.
Calibration and Measurement Requirement Summary (CMRS)â€”A three-category, in-line
summary of measurement parameters. A CMRS identifies all measurement requirements within
a specific system or item of equipment. The CMRS further displays the contractors' proposed
AFI21-113 23 MARCH 2011                                                                        9


solutions for maintaining the system measurement requirements within the stated limits. It is
also used to identify the need for new calibration standards.
Calibration and Measurement Summary (CMS)â€”A technical order which identifies
calibration support necessary to ensure the operational readiness of a specific weapon system,
subsystem or mission. The summary describes the calibration concept and is the calibration
authority for the applicable weapon system, weapon subsystem or mission.
Certificationâ€”The documented designation that standards and TMDE have been calibrated and
meet established technical requirements. When used to refer to a calibration laboratory (PMEL
or AFPSL), certification means the laboratory fulfills AFMETCAL assessment criteria.
MAJCOM (or equivalent)â€”This term refers to all Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs)
and includes the Air National Guard (ANG), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), and Direct
Reporting Units (DRUs).
Metrologyâ€”The science or system of weights and measures used to determine conformance to
technical requirements. This includes the development of standards and systems for absolute and
relative measurements.
Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL)â€”A laboratory authorized to own
and use Air Force base measurement standards to maintain working standards. The working
standards are used along with PMEL-owned TMDE to maintain (troubleshoot, align, repair, and
calibrate) TMDE designated as PMEL responsibility.
Support Equipment Recommendation Data (SERD)â€”A contractual data item submitted by
the contractor to identify weapon system support equipment requirements.
Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE)â€”Those devices used to maintain,
evaluate, measure, calibrate, test, inspect, diagnose, or otherwise examine materials, supplies,
equipment, and systems to identify or isolate actual or potential malfunctions, or decide if they
meet operational specifications established in technical documents.
Traceabilityâ€”The ability to relate individual measurement results to national standards or
nationally accepted measurement systems through an unbroken chain of comparisons all having
stated uncertainties.
Types of Standards Used in Measurement and Testingâ€”The term "standard" means
equipment or physical constants serving as the basic means by which we derive accurate and
traceable precision measurements. These standards include:
a. National Measurement Standardsâ€”Equipment or physical constants identified by NIST to
serve as a basic measurement reference throughout the United States.
b. Air Force Measurement Standardsâ€”Equipment certified by NIST or AFMETCAL-
approved sources, and used by the AFPSL as a basic measurement reference for the US Air
Force.
c. Air Force Base Measurement Standardsâ€”Equipment certified by the AFPSL or
AFMETCAL-approved sources for use by an Air Force PMEL as a measurement reference.
d. Calibration Systemsâ€”A collection of calibration standards and ancillary equipment
uniquely configured to support a specific workload or multiple measurement parameters.
(Calibration Systems may be developed for use in either an automated or manual mode.

AFMETCAL retains engineering and configuration authority for Calibration Systems identified
with an AFMETCAL cage code.)
e. Working Standardsâ€”PMEL-certified TMDE used to calibrate other TMDE.
