                       ORDER TYPES, AUTHORITY, AND RESTRICTION

1.1. Administrative Orders. Administrative orders are written directives, published by a commander or
other competent authority, which direct actions or announce decisions. Order-publishing officials must
follow this instruction and the appropriate functional directives governing the order. Four types of admin-
istrative orders exist: special, reserve, aeronautical, and movement.
    1.1.1. Special Orders (SO).
       1.1.1.1. Direct individuals onto extended active duty or change the status of military personnel on
       active duty (e.g., they appoint, assign, promote, demote, retire, separate, direct temporary duty
       [TDY], and authorize travel of dependents).
       1.1.1.2. Announce assumption and appointment of command, and the closing and opening of a
       headquarters.
       1.1.1.3. Designate, re-designate, activate, inactivate, assign, and reassign all types of United
       States Air Force (USAF)-controlled units and installations. This includes any ANG units and
       installations.
       1.1.1.4. Attach one unit to another.
       1.1.1.5. Authorize travel of Department of Defense (DoD) civilians for permanent change of sta-
       tion (PCS) movements, TDY, and assignment (of military or civilian personnel) to official boards
       or committees; or to other specific duties.
       1.1.1.6. Authorize travel on military aircraft for non-DoD civilians.
       1.1.1.7. Invite civilians who are not federal employees to perform official travel for the Air Force.
       1.1.1.8. Award individual and unit decorations.
    1.1.2. Reserve Orders (RO). These orders apply to Air Force Reserve members not on extended
    active duty (e.g., they appoint; assign; promote; demote; retire; discharge; order to annual, special,
    and school tours of active duty; or change the personnel data or status of Air Force Reserve members
    not on extended active duty).
    1.1.3. Aeronautical Orders (AO).
       1.1.3.1. Start or end aviation career service.
       1.1.3.2. Disqualify or re-qualify members for aviation service.
       1.1.3.3. Award advanced aeronautical ratings.
       1.1.3.4. Award aeronautical badges.
       1.1.3.5. Place members on parachute jump status.
    1.1.4. Movement Orders (MO). These orders move units as directed by HQ USAF or overseas com-
    mands.
    1.1.5. Miscellaneous. When reporting the results of trials and actions of the convening or higher
    authority, either Special Court-Martial Orders or General Court-Martial Orders are issued in accor-
AFI33-328 16 JANUARY 2007                                                                                5


   dance with AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. The Court-Martial Order is also used in
   appellate review. This type of order is different from the Special Order used to convene a Court-Mar-
   tial. The Court-Martial Order is not a special order.

1.2. Authority to Publish Orders. Commanders down to and including squadron level may publish
orders. Commanders below squadron level, such as detachments or flights, may publish TDY orders with
a specific authorization from a higher level commander (see AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders). Com-
manders may publish orders that are not within their jurisdiction only if the proper commander approves
or if HQ USAF directs publication. Hospitals and aero-medical staging units may publish orders on
patients who are members of any Air Force activity, but they will send copies to the patient's parent orga-
nization. The commander or OPR for the specific order instruction may delegate orders publishing
authority, but they will not delegate orders approval authority unless authorized by AFI 51-604, Appoint-
ment to and Assumption of Command.

1.3. Restriction on Publication. Do not publish orders for routine actions unless higher headquarters
directives, legal, or financial requirements make it necessary. Instead, use an appointment memorandum
or other prescribed method. For example, do not publish orders to authorize ordinary leave; to assign
additional duties such as building custodians, TOP SECRET control officers, security officers, record cus-
todians, and fire marshals; to appoint a board or committee when membership is established by position
title in published directives; or to implement personnel actions except group actions announced in "P"
series orders.

2.2. Forms for Orders. Forms standardize and, therefore, simplify the publishing of administrative
orders. When you cannot use a form, you may compose an order. However, be sure to include all required
information. Computer-generated orders may vary in format from form or composed orders as long as
10                                                                         AFI33-328 16 JANUARY 2007


they include all required data. The ANG will use computer-generated orders when possible. Prescribed
forms for orders generation are not applicable to the ANG.

2.3. Composed Orders.
     2.3.1. Paper Size, Margins, and Numbering. See Figure 2.1. for a sample composed order. Use
     8.5-by-11-inch paper and leave a 1-inch margin around each page on all composed orders except for
     computer-generated ones. Number the second page 0.5 inch from the page bottom at the left margin.
     Type the order number in the lower right corner of the first page.
     2.3.2. Heading. Include the following elements in the heading: the title “DEPARTMENT OF THE
     AIR FORCE”; the complete unit designation; the name of the major command (MAJCOM) of assign-
     ment, abbreviated in parentheses; the complete mailing address; the type and number of order; and the
     date the order is published. Do not postdate or antedate the orders.
     2.3.3. Body. Write clearly and concisely. Do not use code words or unauthorized abbreviations. You
     may use abbreviations in the dictionary and authorized nicknames if such use creates no confusion.
     Write a separate paragraph for each action directed. List all persons or activities affected by the same
     action in the same paragraph. Number paragraphs when using more than one.
     2.3.4. Close. Include the following elements in the closing: the orders-approving official's signature
     block, the authority for publishing the orders, when required, distribution, and the authority line when
     not using the commander's name. The OPR for the specific order instruction decides whether to
     include any additional items.
        2.3.4.1. Unless a directive specifically requires it, you need not cite the authority for publishing an
        order. You must, however, cite an authority in all orders that involve travel at government expense.

         2.3.4.2. Refer to Table 2.3. for authorized authority lines.
         2.3.4.3. No seal or signature is needed on computer-generated orders; place the word “OFFI-
         CIAL” above the signature element instead.

     2.3.5. Multiple-Page Orders and Continuation Lines. Strive to keep all orders to two pages--one
     sheet, front and back. If orders are longer than two pages on standard-size paper, print on legal-size
     paper when you can reduce and reproduce the orders on standard-size paper.
         2.3.5.1. Write the order number, publisher, and date at the top of each odd-numbered page (e.g.,
         SO A-109, HQ ACC, Langley AFB VA, 1 September 1998, if you must use more than one sheet,);
         this is optional for even-numbered pages.
         2.3.5.2. Include the heading, order number, date, and authority line on both sides of the page for
         computer-generated, multiple-name orders.
         2.3.5.3. Number multiple-page orders at the bottom of each page to show how many pages are in
         the order (e.g., “Page 1 of 3 Pages”).

2.4. Identifying Personnel.
     2.4.1. Single Person. Type the person's grade and name in CAPITAL letters. The first time you use a
     name, state grade or title; first name, middle initial, last name (or last name, first name, middle initial);
     and social security number (SSN). If the person is on a retired list, write the word "Retired" after the
     grade. Use only the grade or title and last name if you use the same name more than once in the same
     paragraph.
     2.4.2. Groups. When many individuals are on an order, make a machine roster according to AFCSM
     36-699, Volume 1, and photocopy it on the order. Prepare an extract copy (see paragraph 3.9.) accord-

   ing to The Privacy Act of 1974 by omitting SSNs of other members on copies of group orders that are
   given to individual members.
   2.4.3. Unit and MAJCOM of Assignment. Show the unit, MAJCOM, and assignment address of each
   person named in the order. State only "this HQ" or "this unit," as appropriate, on a composed order
   published by the person's unit; do not show the unit address and MAJCOM. OPRs for specific order
   instructions may provide additional guidance.
   2.4.4. Departmental Status and Component. Include the departmental status and component with the
   grade, name, and service number or SSN on orders for military personnel not in the Air Force. For
   example, write: "CAPT MARK HESS 000-00-0000, DA (INF)" or "SQ LEADER JAMES W
   FEARS, 5167, Royal Air Force."
   2.4.5. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) Agents. The AFOSI Special Agent’s (SA)
   rank and grade should be omitted from all TDY and PCS orders. All SAs should have a designated
   single point of contact at Special Orders processing, Permanent Change of Station (PCS) and Traffic
   Management Office (TMO).
   2.4.6. Senior Executive Service (SES), Scientific, or Professional Personnel. Include the traveler's
   position title and precedence priority (distinguished visitor [DV]) code after the name on all forms and
   composed travel orders. For example, write: "SES-3 Deputy Director, Materiel Management
   (OC-ALC) (DV-6)."

2.5. Numbering and Dating Administrative Orders. Number and date each order.
   2.5.1. Number orders by using a letter prefix to identify the series of orders, starting with number 1
   for each fiscal or calendar year (determined by the OPR for the specific order instruction). For exam-
   ple, A-1, A-2, G-1, G-2. When you want to break out a series by specific type of action or preparing
   office, add a second letter prefix.
   2.5.2. Cite the number of the last order published the previous year above the heading of the first
   order of a year. If no orders were published in a series during the preceding year (or years), write: "No
   orders were published in this series in (year or years)."
   2.5.3. Write above the heading of the consolidated order: "SO (series and number), (organization),
   (date), was last SO published in (identify discontinued series). Effective this date, the (discontinued
   series) is consolidated in (new series)" when discontinuing a series of orders and consolidating it with
   another series.
   2.5.4. Continue to number in order when a unit issuing an order inactivates and another unit activates
   immediately to perform the same mission. Cite the authority for the change above the heading of the
   first order published thereafter.
   2.5.5. Begin a new series when a unit is transferred without personnel and equipment to another base
   or command.
   2.5.6. OPRs for specific order instructions may provide additional order numbering guidance as
   deemed appropriate.

                          VERBAL ORDERS AND CHANGES TO ORDERS

3.1. Verbal Orders of the Commander. Do not issue verbal orders if possible. Commanders may issue
verbal orders that involve obligating funds, flying status, or aeronautical ratings of individuals only when
time prevents the publication of written orders in advance of travel.
     3.1.1. Confirm verbal orders (in writing) as soon as possible. In the written order, identify who issued
     the verbal order and the date the verbal order was given. EXAMPLE: The verbal orders of the Cmdr,
     HQ ACC, Langley AFB VA, 1 Oct 98, directing CAPT JAY A. SMITH, 123-45-6789, HQ ACC/IGOF,
     this stn, to proceed on 1 Oct 98 from Langley AFB VA to Luke AFB AZ on TDY for approximately 3
     days to obtain depositions in connection with an aircraft accident investigation and to return to Lan-
     gley AFB VA, are confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in advance. (MSN) (SITE VISIT)
     TDY. Submit a travel voucher within 5 workdays after receipt of orders. (Accounting Classification.)
     Authority: AFI 36-2110 and HQ USAF/IGD Ltr, 30 Sep 98, Aircraft Accident Investigation.
     3.1.2. State why written orders were not issued earlier if funds were spent or flying status or aeronau-
     tical ratings were affected. For example, you might write "The verbal orders of the commander on
     (date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in advance."
     3.1.3. Do not include variations in itinerary when publishing orders after travel is completed.
     3.1.4. The name of the unit that issued the verbal order must be included in the order when an order
     is published by an organization that publishes orders for several units.
     3.1.5. P-series orders may be published after their effective date without a confirmation statement or
     an explanation. Command directors of personnel must make sure publication occurs promptly.

3.2. Amendments, Rescissions, and Revocations. Use AF Form 973, Request and Authorization for
Change of Administrative Orders, to amend, rescind, or revoke an order. See Attachment 2 for instruc-
tions on completing AF Form 973. Use a composed order if the form is not practical. Publish amend-
ments, rescissions, and revocations in the same series as the original order. Do not use blanket statements
such as "Previous orders are rescinded" or "This order supersedes all previously published orders." Do not
use AF Form 973 for orders convening courts-martial, appointing investigating officers for boards or
committees, or for aeronautical orders.

3.3. Who May Change an Order. Normally only the organization that published the original order may
amend, rescind, or revoke it. Functional OPRs for specific order instructions may authorize other organi-
zations or activities to change specific orders. Provide a copy of any changes to the organization that pub-
lished the original order.

3.4. When to Amend an Order. Publish an amendment to add, delete, or change pertinent data to read
as originally intended. Functional OPRs for specific order instructions will provide specific instructions
and guidance on when their orders will be amended, and when an amendment is inappropriate.

3.5. When to Rescind an Order. Rescind an order when it is no longer needed; for example, if an indi-
vidual has blanket or repeated travel orders but now has a change in duty assignment.

3.6. When to Revoke an Order. Revoke an order before it goes into effect or before any funds are
expended.

3.7. Additional Guidance.
   3.7.1. Justify retroactive amendments to orders that increase or decrease the amount of money due the
   traveler or the government. Include justification or an explanation statement in the remarks section of
   the amendment. The justification or explanation statement used in the remarks section of the amend-
   ment must clearly show that the original order was unclear, incomplete, or lacked necessary informa-
   tion.
   3.7.2. The new order may announce the revocation or rescission if an organization revokes or rescinds
   an order and immediately replaces it with another. Add the statement: "This order revokes or rescinds
   (order number and date)" in the remarks section of form orders. Make this statement the last paragraph
   in composed orders.
   3.7.3. When an order is revoked, it no longer exists as an official document. A rescinded order is still
   an official document, although it can no longer be used. Do not revoke a revocation or rescission; pub-
   lish a new order.

3.8. Corrected Copies. Publish a corrected copy of an order only to correct an error in the heading or
close of the original composed order, or the approving official's part of a form order. (To correct a fund
citation or an error in the body of the order, publish an amendment.) Enter "Corrected Copy-Destroy All
Others" and the incorrect number and date at the top of the corrected copy. Use the same heading and
close as on the original composed or form order, correcting only those portions that need it. Double under-
score the corrected portion when possible; and make sure the distribution matches the original order.

3.9. Copies. You may reproduce any order or portion of it, as a copy or an extract copy. Include the same
heading and close as the original composed or form order, and the statement "COPY" or "EXTRACT
COPY." Write only the required information for an extract copy. For example, if a paragraph includes sev-
eral individuals, list only the person who needs the copy on the extract copy. Use asterisks to indicate
omitted material. Any orders issuing or approving official authorized to publish orders may sign copies or
extract copies.

3.10. Printed Information on Reverse of Orders. You may print information on the reverse of special
orders if the OPR for the specific order instruction imposes no specific limitations. Limit information on
the reverse of orders to that which does not reasonably fit on the front. Additional remarks are the most
common use of the reverse side of orders.

            REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, MAINTENANCE, AND DISPOSITION

4.1. Reproduction. Keep orders reproduction to a minimum. Use both sides when duplicating. Revoca-
tion or rescission orders typically do not require the same number of copies as the original order.

4.2. Distribution. Indicate distribution under the word distribution by entering a list of all individuals
and organizations, a distribution code, or both. The orders-publishing organization must maintain the list
of codes and standard distributions if it uses distribution codes.
     4.2.1. Normally, distribute orders no later than the first workday after they are published. Functional
     OPRs for a specific type of order may provide additional guidance.
     4.2.2. Distribute orders to each individual and organization named in the order, except organizations
     where individuals will perform short periods of TDY and all activities listed in standard distribution
     requirement set by publishing authority or higher headquarters. OPRs for orders may establish spe-
     cific order distribution requirements.
     4.2.3. Distribute classified orders only to persons who need them and who have proper clearance.

4.3. Maintenance. The orders publishing activity maintains all record sets of their orders according to
AFI 33-364, Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFRIMS RDS. It may delegate
this authority to subordinate units or activities that publish orders in their name. The orders-publishing
activity is responsible for making sure that all orders are properly prepared, reproduced, distributed, and
maintained.
     4.3.1. File the published copy of each order in numerical sequence by type and series. File back-
     ground material as the orders-approving official directs. Annotate the background material in the
     lower right corner to show the paragraph and order number to which it pertains. Background material
     includes coordination, approvals, letters, messages, justification files for special authorizations, and
     theater clearances. Form orders typically have no background material because they are both a request
     and an order.
     4.3.2. Post each amendment, revocation, or rescission to the original order. After posting the amend-
     ment, revocation, or rescission to the original order, mark the amendment, revocation, or rescission
     with the word "Posted" along with the date of the posting and the initials of the person who posted
     information on the original order.

4.4. Disposition and Retrieval. Each orders-publishing activity accumulating record sets of orders is
responsible for the proper and timely retirement of the records sets. Once inactive records are transferred
to the base records staging area, the base records manager (RM) will assist in retrieval of records sets of
orders upon request and will transfer eligible records to the designated federal records center. If separate
series of orders are published by subordinate units or offices in the name of the parent unit, retire them
with the parent unit's orders.
     4.4.1. Transfer inactive records sets to the base records staging area; attach a listing of all orders to the
     Standard Form (SF) 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, and place a copy of the listing in a folder
     at the very front of the orders. This listing can be a copy of any orders log created and maintained dur-
AFI33-328 16 JANUARY 2007                                                                             17


   ing orders production. Account for all numbers in each orders series, used or unused, on the list. If
   records cannot be located or were prematurely destroyed, efforts must be made to reconstruct or locate
   them (AFI 33-364).
   4.4.2. Maintain a copy of the SF 135, receipted by the base RM, in the office transferring the records
   to facilitate future retrieval.

4.5. Forms (Adopted and Prescribed).
   4.5.1. Adopted Forms: SF 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt; AF Form 847, Recommendation for
   Change of Publication; AF Form 2096, Classification/On-The-Job Training Action; and AF Form
   2098, Duty Status Change.
   4.5.2. Prescribed Form. AF Form 973, Request and Authorization for Change of Administrative
   Orders.

Terms
Authentication—The process that makes an administrative order valid. In most cases the signature (or
official stamp) of the orders approving official or designated representative is enough to validate an order.
A separate authentication is unnecessary. However, the functional OPRs may require additional
authentication if they think it is necessary.

Effective Date—The date orders go into effect. This is usually the date of the order, unless the order
specifies a different effective date or confirms previous verbal orders. To determine the effective date of
military permanent change of station orders of entitlements, see JTFR, Volume 1, and JTR, Volume 2.
Functional Order Office of Primary Responsibility—Organization that guides and manages specific
orders programs, although it may not actually prepare the specific order.
Orders-Issuing or Approving Official—The competent authority who determines the need for an order,
requests its publication, justifies special authorizations, and approves claims for reimbursing items not
authorized in the order or that requires administrative approval. This official normally signs manually
prepared orders but may also use a stamp. He or she does not need to sign computer-generated orders.
However, if neither a signature nor stamp is used, there must be adequate controls to ensure proper
approval.

                    PREPARING AIR FORCE FORM 973,
    REQUEST AND AUTHORIZATION FOR CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS

A2.1. Use AF Form 973 to amend, rescind, or revoke an order. Publish amendments, rescissions, and
revocations in the same series as the original order.
   A2.1.1. Rescind an order when some action was already taken on the published order, for example,
   travel advance or transportation request.
   A2.1.2. Revoke an order when no action occurs against the original order.
   A2.1.3. Amend an order to change data in it.
   A2.1.4. If the order is revoked only as it pertains to some, but not all, individuals in the basic order,
   type the words In Part after marking the Revoked block. This is not necessary if already preprinted on
   the form.

A2.2. Items 1A through C, and 8 through 15. Self-explanatory.

A2.3. Item 1D ([TED][PCS with PCA][PCS without PCA]). Include date and check applicable block.

A2.4. Item 2. Include all previous amendments.

A2.5. Item 3 (Relating to TDY, PCS, Short Tour of AD, and so on). Include the original action, TDY,
PCS, and so on. If the change involves a reassignment, include the gaining unit shown in the basic order;
control Air Force specialty code (AFSC)(airmen), primary AFSC (officers), and assignment action num-
ber or shipment line number.

A2.6. Item 4 (Identification of the Individual to Whom Change Action Pertains). Do not use this
form if the original order appointed a board or committee. Instead, use a composed order. When an
amendment applies to everyone listed on the basic order, use the statement, same as basic order, instead
of repeating names on the amending order.

A2.7. Item 5A (Amendment). When indicating a change in wording, underscore the portion that is
changed and what it is changed to read.

A2.8. Item 5B (Is amended to [Include][Delete]). Cross out the one that does not apply.

A2.9. Item 6 (Remarks). Include information not covered by preceding items (e.g., the authority for the
action when required). This item may also be used to continue preceding items when more space is
needed.

A2.10. Item 7 (Accounting Citation). On revocation or rescission orders there is no need to repeat the
fund cited in the original order. On amendments, include a fund cite only if this change is correcting it or
if additional funds are required. On amendments calling for the spending of additional funds, such as
extension of TDY or travel to additional TDY points, get the initials of the fund-approving official.
22                                                                   AFI33-328 16 JANUARY 2007


A2.11. Item 16. Use this block only when local policy requires it.
