                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This Instruction establishes an EMS as the framework for continual program and
process improvement through clearly defined environmental roles and responsibilities, planning
requirements, budgeting, effective implementation and operation, and management review.
Figure 1.1 illustrates the linkage between the EMS framework and Air Force (AF) guidance.

Figure 1.1. Air Force EMS Vision.




1.2. Concepts.
     1.2.1. Per Executive Order (EO) 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and
     Transportation Management, the AF shall establish and maintain an EMS. The EMS shall
     conform to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 Standard,
     Environmental Management Systems – Requirements with guidance for use, in accordance
     with (IAW) federal and Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines. The EMS shall sustain
     and enhance mission capability by:
        1.2.1.1. Maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and
        policy requirements.
        1.2.1.2. Reducing compliance burden by implementing pollution prevention (P2)
        solutions that reduce the quantity and impact of pollutants.
        1.2.1.3. Sustaining natural, cultural, built, and human resources.
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                       7


      1.2.1.4. Incorporating EMS and Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health
      (ESOH) considerations into installation Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century
      (AFSO21) Lean Events to improve mission capacity and prevent waste.
      1.2.1.5. Providing community outreach to increase awareness of environmental issues.
      1.2.1.6. Incorporating EMS elements           into   specific   operations   of   appropriate
      organizational-levels and installations.
      1.2.1.7. Meeting or exceeding current Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DoD,
      and AF performance measures.
1.3. Methodology.
   1.3.1. Enhancing the existing compliance-focused Environmental Quality (EQ) Program
   with Asset Management (AM) and EMS principles allows the AF to: sustain and modernize
   its asset portfolio; increase mission capability; achieve federal sustainability goals; maintain
   compliance with federal, state, and local laws, country-specific Final Governing Standards
   (FGSs) or DoD Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) standards
   if no FGSs exist, binding obligations under international agreements, and DoD and AF policy
   and guidance; and restore contaminated sites with reduced environmental mission impacts.
   1.3.2. This Instruction provides Headquarters (HQ) AF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs,
   installations, and all other AF units with a framework for developing and maintaining either
   an organizational-level EMS or an installation EMS. It integrates environmental impact
   analysis, operational risk management, and P2 methodologies into the EMS to institute
   sustainable practices across the AF mission and reduce both ESOH risk and the AF‘s
   environmental footprint. This Instruction establishes key requirements using EMS principles
   for planning, programming, implementing, and monitoring to ensure an effective
   environmental program.

   engineering policy and guidance in DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition
   System, the Defense Acquisition Guidebook, AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life
   Cycle Management, and AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, to manage the
   environmental aspects and possible impacts of the systems they develop and sustain. These
   systems engineering policies and procedures comply with the intent and the requirements of
   an EMS. AFI 32-7001 and AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, link the
   installation and organizational-level EMS to these acquisition and sustainment systems
   engineering processes. When an EMS cross-functional team identifies environmental aspects
   that need to be addressed by changes to the weapon system design or procedures, the EMS
   team will use the procedures in these 32-series documents to insert those needs into the
   weapon system change processes.

                                           Chapter 3

                               PLANNING REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Types of Environmental Management Systems (EMSs). The AF has three types of
EMSs: organizational-level, multi-site-level, and installation-level. Attachment 3 lists the
requirements for each type.
   3.1.1. Organizational-Level EMS. An organizational-level EMS contains those elements
   necessary for setting and transmitting objectives and targets to lower units and for collecting,
   packaging, and reporting accomplishments and compliance. An organizational-level EMS
   will seldom contain all the elements of an International Organization for Standardization
   (ISO) 14001 conforming EMS and those elements that it does contain may/may not conform
   to the ISO 14001 specifications. The Federal Environmental Executive has exempted
   organizational-level EMSs from the Federal requirement for periodic Declaration of
   Conformance.
       3.1.1.1. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) EMS. The HAF ESOH
       Council‘s Steering Committee oversees the HQ USAF EMS. This organizational-level
       EMS serves to flow down environmental requirements through the MAJCOMs and other
       appropriate organizational-levels to the installations. The ESOH Steering Committee
       members responsible for military activities with environmental impacts shall:
          3.1.1.1.1. Include specific environmental sustainability objectives and targets into
          their appropriate operational/ implementing instructions. Develop action plans that
          shall be met by subordinate organizations and installations in order for the AF to
          comply with requirements imposed by Federal authorities including OMB, Council
          on Environmental Quality (CEQ), Office of the Federal Environmental Executive
          (OFEE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), DoD, etc.
          3.1.1.1.2. Include mandated Federal regulations and guideline goals in the HQ USAF
          EMS as objectives and targets that will be reflected in action plans created under
          installation-level EMSs.
          3.1.1.1.3. Include procedures for establishing and/or reviewing: legal and other
          requirements, objectives and targets, ESOHC, communications and data gathering,
          assessments, environmental sustainability performance measures, management
          review and reporting.
          3.1.1.1.4. Collect, analyze and report AF performance information and significant
          aspects to higher authority (ESOHC, OSD, etc.).
          3.1.1.1.5. Track performance toward meeting environmental sustainability
          performance measures and DoD sustainability goals, and determine return on
          investment and reduction of environmental impact.
       3.1.1.2. MAJCOM EMS. MAJCOM organizational-level EMSs serve to flow down
       environmental requirements from the MAJCOMs and other intermediate level
       organizations to the installations.
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   23


          3.1.1.2.1. Include procedures for establishing and/or reviewing: legal and other
          requirements, objectives and targets, ESOHC, communications and data gathering,
          assessments, environmental sustainability performance measures, management
          review and reporting.
          3.1.1.2.2. Collect, analyze and report MAJCOM performance information and
          significant aspects to higher authority.
      3.1.1.2.3. Track performance toward meeting environmental sustainability performance
      measures and DoD sustainability goals, and determine return on investment and reduction
      of environmental impacts.
   3.1.2. Multi-site EMS. A multi-site EMS must be in conformance with the specifications in
   the ISO 14001 standard. The multi-site EMS encompasses more than one installation or
   facility. The key attribute of a multi-site EMS is the management of environmental aspects
   of all the sites‘ activities, products, and services as one EMS. This type of EMS is not
   exempt from the federal requirement for periodic Declaration of Conformance (every three
   years). A multi-site EMS may be appropriate and useful where a number of small locations
   have little to no environmental resources and receive support and direction from another
   higher-level organization, location, or installation. One example of a multi-site EMS is a
   Wing EMS that includes the parent installation and all of its geographically separated units.
   3.1.3. Installation EMS. Installation EMSs are not exempt from the federal requirement for
   periodic Declaration of Conformance (every three years). They must be in conformance with
   the specifications in the ISO 14001 standard. The scope of an installation EMS includes all
   organizations and facilities within the boundary and/or span of control of an ―appropriate
   facility.‖ Installations shall consider and may include MAJCOM EMS objectives and targets
   in the installation level EMS.

Figure 3.1. EMS Policy and Planning.

   3.2.5. Objectives, Targets, and Programs (Action Plans) (paragraph 3.3.5.).
   3.2.6. Resources, Roles, Responsibility, and Authority (paragraph 5.2.).
   3.2.7. Communication (paragraph 5.3).
   3.2.8. Documentation and Documentation Control (paragraph 5.4).
   3.2.9. Emergency Preparedness and Response (paragraph 5.5).
   3.2.10. Competence Training and Awareness (paragraph 5.6).
   3.2.11. Operational Controls (paragraph 5.7).
   3.2.12. Monitoring and Measurement (paragraphs 7.1.-7.5.).
   3.2.13. Evaluation of Compliance (paragraph 7.2.).
   3.2.14. Nonconformity, Corrective Action, and Preventive Action (paragraph 7.6.).
   3.2.15. Control of Records (paragraph 5.4.).
   3.2.16. Internal Audit (paragraph 7.2.).
   3.2.17. Management Review (paragraphs 8.1.-8.3.).
3.3. EMS Planning Phase. This section describes elements included in an installation‘s EMS
planning phase. The EMS planning phase includes scope, environmental policy, environmental
aspects and impacts, legal and other requirements, objectives and targets, and action plans
(Figure 3.1). Effective planning allows the installation‘s leadership to focus resources on
mitigating risks that present the greatest threat to mission capability. Planning is a critical
component of reducing the burden of maintaining compliance and conformance, and ensuring NI
asset capacity, of which both support sustaining existing and future mission capability.
   3.3.1. EMS Scope. Define and document the scope of the EMS. The scope may be limited
   by excluding certain organizations such as those with different line of command authority
   (i.e., Army Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), ANG installations) if they are covered
   under a separate EMS and aspects which are deemed outside of the installation‘s ability to
   effectively control or influence. Installations shall consult with their MAJCOM EMS
   program manager on the scope of their EMS.
   3.3.2. Environmental Policy. The Environmental Policy Statement articulates senior
   leadership‘s vision of what they desire the EMS to accomplish. For a multi-site EMS,
   application of one policy statement may be appropriate for multiple locations. Installation
   EMSs must have a local policy approved annually by the Installation Commander or the
   ESOHC Chair. The environmental policy has the following requirements:
       3.3.2.1. Is appropriate to the nature, scale, and environmental impacts of its activities,
       products, and services.
       3.3.2.2. Includes a commitment to continual improvement and prevention of pollution.
       3.3.2.3. Includes a commitment to comply with applicable legal and policy requirements
       (including standards in the country specific FGS or OEBGD, if an FGS does not exist)
       and with other requirements to which the organization subscribes which relate to its
       environmental aspects.
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  25

        3.3.2.5.3. Available to the public.
  3.3.3. Environmental Aspects and Impacts.
     3.3.3.1. The installation CFT shall document aspects and impacts for the installation‘s
     activities, products, and services. Aspects are elements of activities, products, and
     services that can interact with the environment and produce either a negative or positive
     environmental impact. Aspects classified as significant are managed formally in the
     EMS through the setting of objectives and targets, the establishment of environmental
     action plans, and the application of operational controls. All significant aspects need to
     be addressed in this manner though the resources and timeframes allocated to each will
     vary based on its priority as determined by requirements, contingencies, and the needs of
     the organization. Significant aspects should be reported to the MAJCOM and AFCEE
     annually.
     3.3.3.2. The CFT shall establish, implement, and maintain a procedure to update/identify
     the environmental aspects of its activities, and products and services within the defined
     scope of the EMS. This is an annual requirement and the CFT shall consider planned
     new facilities and new or modified missions during this review. They shall consider the
     requirements of the Base General Plan, NIA results, AMPs, Strategic Plans (AF/A7C),
     regulatory and other requirements (e.g., EOs).
        3.3.3.2.1. Base General Plan. The General Plan guides the installation commander
        and decision-makers in determining the installation‘s capability to support the current
        mission and potential future development. The General Plan is the executive
        summary of the BCAMP, and relates to the installation strategic vision.
        3.3.3.2.2. NIA. The NIA identifies opportunities and deficiencies associated with NI
        assets, as well as encroachment pressures and other factors that degrade or deny
        resource availability.
        3.3.3.2.3. Environmental Action Plans (EAPs). EAPs capture program specific
        requirements and management actions for a significant aspect that are designed to
        achieve the objectives/targets, tasks and the reliable application of operational
        controls. EAPs shall include environmental compliance, conservation, and P2
        requirements, and may include related EMS objectives and associated NI concerns
        found during the NIA or through other assessments. For CE, these should be
        consistent with CE AMP requirements.
        3.3.3.2.4. AMPs. AMPs capture all the requirements necessary for providing
        particular services in the following areas: facilities, utilities, pavements, NI, and
        waste management. AMPs shall include elements from the EAPs that address
        operational controls and the tasks to be done in order to achieve the environmental
        objectives and targets.

  3.3.4. Legal and Other Requirements. Installations shall identify and have access to the
  legal requirements and other requirements that are applicable to the environmental aspects of
  its mission activities, products, and/or services. AF installations shall conduct ongoing
  review of new and emerging requirements. These may include:
     3.3.4.1. AF and/or MAJCOM requirements to achieve specific sustainability objectives
     and targets.
     3.3.4.2. National and state/local/departmental legal requirements.
     3.3.4.3. International legal requirements including applicable Host Nation standards that
     are in effect and enforced, and obligations under binding international agreements.
  3.3.5. Objectives, Targets, and Programs (Action Plans).
     3.3.5.1. Objectives and Targets. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Energy,
     Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health) (SAF/IEE), Air Staff, HQ USAF,
     MAJCOMs, installations, and other relevant organizational-levels shall set, manage, and
     update objectives and targets to achieve the federal compliance and sustainability goals;
     reduce environmental risk; and sustain mission capability. Federal, state, DoD, AF, and
     overseas requirements should be considered when setting objectives and targets.
     3.3.5.2. SAF/IEE, HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, and installations shall:
         3.3.5.2.1. Set measureable objectives and targets consistent with AF environmental
         policy, in compliance with applicable legal requirements, and provide continual

         account significant environmental aspects and legal and other requirements.
         3.3.5.2.2. Consider feasible technological options, financial, operational, and
         business requirements and the views of interested parties.
         3.3.5.2.3. Incorporate identified NI asset needs (e.g., as identified in the NIA, to
         improve mission capability/capacity).
         3.3.5.2.4. Review and approve objectives and targets through the ESOHC Chair
         annually.
         3.3.5.2.5. Develop action plans to meet their objectives and targets. It is through
         these concise action plans that the installation begins to translate guidance and
         objectives into concrete actions.
         3.3.5.2.6. Identify sustainability requirements within action plans and related
         programming/planning requirements.

          process, and site) that contain those environmental aspects. Also, include person or
          position responsible for each operational control, and the documents or records
          associated with each operational control.
          3.3.5.3.7. Identify individuals responsible for each task. Identify any special skills,
          training, certification, and other resources required to complete the assigned tasks.
          3.3.5.3.8. List the records and or documents generated by the action plan and list
          storage location and retention times of the records or documents.
          3.3.5.3.9. For aspects that generate a pollutant, document the application of the P2
          methodology IAW this AFI.
3.4. Natural Infrastructure Assessments (NIA).
   3.4.1. Major installations and Continental United States (CONUS) ranges shall conduct
   NIAs and consider the assessment results during the installation‘s annual aspect inventory
   review, when determining scope and objectives and during the EMS management review.
      3.4.1.1. Annually review the NIA and revise it at a minimum of every three years or
      more frequently as necessary.
      3.4.1.2. Submit a report of the assessment to the MAJCOM for distribution to AF/A7C.
      Specific information is contained on the AF/A7C Portal.
   3.4.2. NIAs identify the capability and capacity of the NI to support the mission.
      3.4.2.1. Managing NI assets requires a holistic approach linking all organizations using
      NI assets (e.g., airspace, frequency spectrum, test and training areas, etc.) and
      management actions to mission sustainment.
      3.4.2.2. NIA integrates associated operational and environmental information to provide
      decision makers with a complete picture regarding current operational opportunities,
      deficiencies, and impacts.
   3.4.3. Assess trends using continued data collection to determine the sustainability of vital
   NI assets.
      3.4.3.1. At installation and MAJCOM levels, this process assists in identifying and
      prioritizing initiatives to address mission inefficiencies and encroachment, and leverages
      excess capacities for mission growth.
      3.4.3.2. At the HQ USAF and DoD levels, when combined with similar data from other
      commands and Services, senior leaders can understand the impacts of high-level
      decisions, such as basing.

         ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PROGRAMMING AND BUDGETING

4.1. Environmental Quality (EQ) Programming and Budgeting. This chapter is part of the
EMS Plan phase (Figure 4.1) and provides guidance on programming and budgeting for the AF
EQ Program. The EQ Programming and Budgeting process: provides the necessary resources to
achieve the goals and objectives of the Air Force Strategic Plan, the multi-site, or installation
EMS, or other major program objectives; and provides instructions resulting in an auditable and
transparent budget. The EQ program includes the Program Elements (PE) of compliance,
conservation, and P2. For Environmental Restoration Account instruction, refer to AFI 32-7020,
The Environmental Restoration Program.

Figure 4.1. EMS Planning.




   4.1.1. Programming Guidance. Three documents govern the EQ Programming and
   Budgeting process: EQ Programming Matrix; EQ Standard Titles, Caps and Scores; and
   Scoring Model. Specific information is located on the AF/A7C Portal.
       4.1.1.1. The environmental quality Program Element Codes (PEC) for Compliance,
       Conservation, and P2 comprise the EQ Programming Matrix. Each PEC is further
       divided by Level 0, Valid-Recurring Level 1, 2, 3, and Not Valid requirements. Use the
       EQ Programming Matrix to determine if the requirement is valid or not valid for EQ
       funding.
       4.1.1.2. The EQ Standard Titles, Caps, and Scores document is organized by major work
       tasks, (e.g., TDY, Training, Reports, Plans, and Assessments) and includes specific
       details for Level 0 recurring projects only. Use the EQ Standard Titles to program Level
       0 projects.
   4.1.2. Scoring Model. Each installation shall apply the EQ Prioritization Model to each
   requirement. Five scoring factors comprise the EQ Priority Model: Return on Investment
   (ROI); Environmental Risk; Regulatory Implications; Mission Degradation; and Community
   Concern.
       4.1.2.1. Enter all EQ requirements into AF-approved software following the EQ
       Programming guides and supplemental budgeting policy and guidance. MAJCOMS shall
       review all requirements for validity, AFCEE provides assessment, and HQ USAF/A7C
       submits for funding. MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring consistent interpretation of
 30                                                           AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011


      the scoring model across the installations. In turn, HQ USAF/A7C will use the individual
      scores, for validated projects, to prepare an AF-wide EQ IPL.
      4.1.2.2. Prioritization of EQ projects should reflect the results from the prioritized list of
      EMS aspects.
   4.1.3. Program Elements (PEs). PEs are the primary data elements in OSD‘s Future Year
   Defense Program. They are the building blocks of the programming and budgeting system
   and are tied to one or multiple Major Force Programs (MFP).
      4.1.3.1. All MFPs can attach environmental compliance, conservation, and P2 PEs.
      4.1.3.2. Program Element Codes (PECs) can receive funding from a variety of
      appropriations (see Table 4.1).

Table 4.1. PEC Applicability by Appropriation.




4.2. Project Planning and Programming – Program Objective Memorandum (POM).
   4.2.1. Installation Project Planning and Programming. Installation AM Program
   Managers shall ensure, plan, and program, per MAJCOM tasking using AF approved
   program management software.
      4.2.1.1. Installations should develop their POM submittals to achieve the EMS objectives
      reflective of the prioritized environmental aspects.
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                      31


      4.2.1.2. Installation Asset Managers will work with the CFT to formally present and
      advocate prioritized projects to the ESOHC or applicable subcommittee to obtain
      appropriate approvals.
   4.2.2. MAJCOM Programming. MAJCOMs will review, evaluate, and validate all
   installation project submittals.
      4.2.2.1. P2 Programming. POM submittals for the P2 element should be based upon
      the analyses in EMS Action Plans as outlined in this AFI. POM submittals shall address
      factors such as the EMS aspect ranking, risk assessments, total operating costs,
      compliance burdens, and projected gains in mission productivity, health and safety, and
      transferability to other AF/DoD organizations. Consolidate requirements where
      economies of scale will provide a cost savings.
      4.2.2.2. If the objectives or targets require changes to Weapon System (WS) or WS
      support processes, work with the appropriate MAJCOM WS lead(s) to submit the
      requirement to the appropriate WS program manager(s) as a formal WS change
      requirement IAW AFI 32-7086. Submit technology need requirement to AFMCs
      Sustainment Technology Process (STP) IAW AFI 61-101, Applied Technology Council.
      Once the program manager is involved, multiple sources of funding are available for
      executing a WSP2 project. The preferred method of funding is the standard WS funding
      stream. Under certain conditions, O&M funding is appropriate. If the funding guidance
      allows, CFTs may develop and submit WS Program Element P2 inputs to their AF Panel.
   4.2.3. Program Execution. Enter funding approval into AF approved program management
   software for tracking purposes by project line item. Upon obligation, enter other relevant
   information. HQ USAF/A7C shall track the rate of obligation. In preparation for the
   execution year prior to distribution, MAJCOMs and installations shall ensure that the
   validated EQ Program established in the POM and/or financial/execution plan is still
   supported, ensuring that all environmental compliance requirements are met.
4.3. Environmental Quality Requirements Introduction. AF EQ requirements are recurring
(Level 0) or non-recurring (Levels 1-3). The EQ Programming Matrix provides specific
examples of supported and non-supported EQ requirements.
   4.3.1. Level 0 – Maintain Compliance (Operations and Services). Level 0 requirements
   include activities such as the recurring administrative, personnel, and other costs associated
   with managing EQ programs. These programs are necessary to maintain environmental
   compliance, meet EO goals/objectives, and prevent natural resource degradation that may
   affect military readiness. Refer to the HQ USAF/A7CA EQ Programming Matrix for
   examples of supported and non-supported Level 0 requirements and for the EQ Standard
   Titles list for Level 0 projects.
   4.3.2. Nonrecurring Environmental Quality Requirements Introduction. AF EQ non-
   recurring funding requirements have three levels:
      4.3.2.1. Level 1 – Fix Noncompliance. A Level 1 requirement corrects a non-
      conformance or out-of-compliance condition with a supported driver in the programmed
      year and must receive funding. A supported driver includes federal, state, and local laws
      and regulations; legal or regulatory mandates (e.g., consent orders, judicial decrees, etc.);
      tribal laws; EOs; and DoD or AF regulations. For installations outside the US or its
 32                                                           AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011


       territories, supported drivers include the OEBGD, FGS, obligations under binding
       international agreements (e.g., the German Supplementary Agreement to the North
       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)), and other
       applicable DoD policy and AF directives that specifically apply to overseas locations.
       Level 1 projects also include those that currently conform or comply with applicable
       requirements but are necessary to prevent non-conformance and non-compliance in the
       programmed year, as well as P2 projects with a 10-year or less return on investment
       and/or an elimination or significant reduction of a significant aspect (to include reduction
       of compliance burdens). See the HQ USAF/A7CA EQ Programming Matrix for
       examples of supported and non-supported Level 1 requirements.
       4.3.2.2. Level 2 – Prevent Noncompliance. Level 2 requirements are for activities and
       projects that are currently in compliance, but are necessary to prevent non-compliance
       with an applicable driver or mission deadline beyond the programmed year. These
       requirements are generally the same as Level 1 requirements except for the timing of the
       non-compliance.
       4.3.2.3. Level 3 – Enhance Environment. Level 3 requirements are for activities and
       projects and non-recurring requirements not explicitly required by an applicable driver,
       but are needed to enhance the environment beyond otherwise compliant conditions or to
       achieve overall environmental goals and objectives.
4.4. Balanced Program Management. Large Level 1 requirements may be phased over
multiple years (consistent with AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded
Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects). These projects are not to exceed a POM cycle
and should satisfy all required compliance dates. The primary reason for programming and
budgeting multi-year projects as Level 1 is to sustain a balanced program and avoid costly
―spikes‖ and shortfalls in the programmed year.
4.5. SRM, EQ, and Military Construction (MILCON). Existing infrastructure systems
should be maintained, repaired, and replaced with SRM funds and not EQ, with the following
exceptions:
   4.5.1. An infrastructure repair, replacement, or upgrade project is eligible for EQ funding if
   the project is required to comply with new federal or state environmental laws or regulations
   with discharge limits, or, if overseas, OEBGD or country-specific FGS, and/or international
   agreement requirements. This does not include new requirements levied from infrastructure
   or capacity deficiencies.
   4.5.2. An infrastructure repair, replacement, or upgrade (that is of MILCON scope) is
   eligible for funding as an Environmental, Health, and Safety MILCON project if the project
   is required to comply with new federal and state discharge limits or, if overseas, OEBGD or
   country-specific FGS, and applicable international agreement requirements. This does not
   include new requirements levied from infrastructure capacity deficiencies. Health and Safety
   MILCON projects must compete with other MAJCOM MILCON priorities IAW current HQ
   USAF/A7CA policy. For more information on MILCON, see AFI 32-1001, Operations
   Management, and AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming MILCON Projects.
   4.5.3. If an installation receives a formal notice of non-compliance or has received a major
   finding in an ESOHCAMP assessment (validated by the appropriate MAJCOM and
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    33


   Headquarters United States Air Force Asset Management and Operations Division,
   Environmental Branch (HQ USAF/A7CAN)), an infrastructure project to correct the non-
   compliant portion of the facility, system, or component may be eligible for EQ funding. As
   part of a request for EQ funding support for non-compliance, MAJCOMs shall accomplish an
   engineering evaluation for the non-compliant portion to document specifically what facilities,
   portion(s) or components(s) of the system are non-compliant, and why the EQ project scope
   and programmed amount are necessary to correct the non-compliance. MAJCOM and
   A7CAN will need to assess the seriousness of the situation based on history of compliance
   and preventive repair/maintenance actions taken to date.
4.6. Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) Environmental Cleanup and
Overseas Remediation. For guidance, see the HQ USAF/A7CA EQ Programming Matrix for
Non-Environmental Restoration Account Cleanup and Overseas Remediation, AFI 32-7020 and
the associated Programming matrix.

                                           Chapter 5

                          IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION

5.1. Implementation and Operation Phase. This chapter provides guidance on the
Implementation and Operation Phase of the EMS (Figure 5.1) that facilitates long-term mission
sustainability by focusing on: reducing negative environmental impacts and risk; increasing NI
capacity; and continually improving environmental performance. This includes day-to-day
compliance activities such as sampling activities, reporting, recordkeeping, and training, as well
as working to achieve the objectives and targets and the action plans set during the Planning
Phase. Installations shall define and delegate specific roles and responsibilities; implement work
instructions and operating procedures; and provide training to ensure personnel understand their
responsibilities and can perform their tasks appropriately. Document storage and retrieval
methods shall be maintained to allow personnel access to the current versions of all plans,
instructions, memoranda, permits, and other documents necessary for performance of their
environmental duties. In addition, installations shall identify, implement, improve and maintain
operational controls, and refine emergency preparedness, response plans, and procedures. See
AF/A7C Portal for additional information.

5.2. Structure and Authorities. Installations shall clearly define and communicate the
organizational structure and the responsibilities assigned to each unit and individual to support
the AM, Environmental and BI programs.
   5.2.1. Installations shall clearly define and document roles and responsibilities (current
   AFPDs) and AFIs communicate organizational structure and responsibilities but may require
   some additional augmentation on installation-specific requirements).
   5.2.2. Each installation‘s ESOHC Chair or the Installation Commander must appoint a CFT
   chair and an EMS Coordinator. The CFT chair shall be a deputy group commander or higher
   and is responsible for leading the implementation and maintenance of the EMS.
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   35


   5.2.3. Identify CFT members (such as environmental media managers, BE, UECs, energy
   managers, HMMP team members, HAZMATs emergency planning and post-emergency
   response team members, PA, contracting, air space manager, planners, frequency manager,
   and other ESOHC representatives, should also be assigned if they are not already team
   members).
5.3. Internal and External Communications. Internal communication processes can be used
to identify requirements for personnel and increase overall environmental awareness. External
communications allows consideration of the views of interested external stakeholders in the
EMS. The current AF program provides for both internal and external communications to satisfy
various regulatory and AF requirements as defined in AFPD 35-1, Public Affairs Management,
AFI 35-105, Community Relations, and AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures.
   5.3.1. Each installation shall clarify and document installation-specific communication
   procedures to ensure that:
       5.3.1.1. All personnel on the installation are aware of the environmental policy.
       5.3.1.2. Explain how to accomplish communication.
       5.3.1.3. Communication is effective at all relevant levels and functions.
       5.3.1.4. A procedure is in place to respond to relevant communications from external
       interested parties. The installation shall document its decision on whether it chooses to
       communicate information regarding significant environmental aspects externally.
5.4. Document Management, Control, and Records Management. Personnel shall have
access to the most current documents and up-to-date records. Installations shall follow AFMAN
33-363, Management of Records, to establish and maintain an effective environmental records
management program.
   5.4.1. Each installation shall have an electronic EMS Manual. The manual describes the
   main elements and procedures of the EMS and references related documents.
   5.4.2. Each installation shall:
       5.4.2.1. Approve documents for adequacy prior to issue.
       5.4.2.2. Review and update documents as necessary.

       accordance with AFI 33-364, Records Disposition: Procedures and Responsibilities.
 36                                                          AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011


5.5. Emergency Response. Installations shall have emergency response plans and procedures
in place to respond to and mitigate potential impacts arising from emergencies. Review these
procedures after the occurrence of accidents or emergencies. In addition, the installation should
periodically test the established procedures IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
Management Program Planning and Operations.
5.6. Education, Training, and Awareness. All AF personnel (military, civilian) and
contractors shall know the environmental requirements that apply to their daily duties and
receive the commensurate level of environmental education and training for those duties. EMS
General Awareness Training is available on the Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS).
Personnel involved in activities negatively affecting the environment shall receive additional
specialized training related to their specific duties. Individuals who manage environmental
media programs (e.g. air, water, hazardous waste programs, etc.) or who are directly involved
with some aspect of a media program shall obtain media-specific specialized training.
Environmental education and training requirements are mandated by law or required by permit
(e.g., hazardous waste (HW) training), or driven by EO, DoD policy, AF implementing
instructions, and/or identified as best business practices. Funding for training may come from a
variety of sources such as, but not limited, to unit funds, AFIT, the CE Environmental Function,
and the Installation Education and Training Office.
   5.6.1. Installations should have an established training procedure to make all installation
   personnel aware of:
       5.6.1.1. The environmental policy and procedures of the management system (i.e., plans,
       instructions, checklists, etc.).
       5.6.1.2. The significant environmental aspects, regulatory compliance issues, and related
       actual or potential impacts associated with their work, and the mission related benefits of
       improved personal performance.
       5.6.1.3. Their roles and responsibilities in achieving regulatory compliance and
       conformity with the requirements of the management system.
       5.6.1.4. The potential consequences of departure from specified plans, procedures
       checklists, and other documentation.
       5.6.1.5. The need to accomplish and document training upon arrival at a new duty
       station.
       5.6.1.6. The frequency of training.
5.7. Operational Controls. Installations shall ensure adequate operational controls are in place
to control, mitigate, or prevent negative environmental impacts. Operational controls may be
physical (e.g., secondary containment), engineering (e.g., alarm system), or administrative (e.g.,
checklist).
   5.7.1. Ensure stipulated operating criteria critical to environmental performance is included
   in operational controls (e.g., permit requirements) that could affect mission operations.
   5.7.2. Develop and implement procedures to prevent non-compliance, an adverse
   environmental impact, and/or to achieve stated objectives and targets or performance
   measures. Installations shall implement source reductions as identified in installation EMS
   action plans.
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                37


  5.7.3. The installation shall communicate applicable procedures and requirements to
  suppliers and service providers, including contractors. Buying recycled content, bio-based,
  or energy efficient products are examples of applicable purchasing requirements from the AF
  GPP that installations shall communicate.
 38                                                          AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011


                                           Chapter 6

                       POLLUTION PREVENTION INTEGRATION

6.1. Background. P2 is part of the EMS Do Phase (Figure 6.1) and is an ESOH risk reduction
strategy for environmental aspects that generate pollutants. Each facility shall use their EMS to
identify opportunities to optimize selected business, operational, or industrial processes or
activities in terms of pollutant reduction, lower energy use, reduction in the use of natural
resources, water conservation and improvements to health and safety. Installations should
identify P2 and related green procurement and sustainability requirements within the installation
EMS as well as incorporate into installation and MAJCOM AMPs and related programming and
planning requirements/documents. Refer to the AF/A7C Portal for additional information.

Figure 6.1. P2 in the EMS Implementation and Operation Phase.




6.2. Hazardous Process Authorization (HPA). The HPA is an ESOH-based process
authorization as described in AFI 32-7086. It can evaluate the aspects/impacts of discrete AF
units of work or processes. This authorization can include an analysis of impacts on air, water,
land, waste, safety, and occupational health. All HPA analyses shall utilize the P2 methodology
to identify opportunities for ESOH risk reduction. This review should include NI impacts
beyond hazardous materials. All media POCs shall be involved.
6.3. Weapon System Pollution Prevention (WSP2). AFI 32-7086 covers P2 involving WS
HAZMATs. WS program managers have engineering control over WSs and their maintenance
processes. All WS ESOH risk reduction projects must include the involvement of the affected
WS program manager(s) and other appropriate stakeholders (such as the operations,
maintenance, and customers) requirements. Once the program manager is involved, multiple
sources of funding are available for executing a WSP2 project.
6.4. Green Procurement Program (GPP). Green Procurement is the purchase of
environmentally preferable products and services in accordance with federally mandated "green"
procurement preference programs. The purpose of the GPP is to enhance and sustain mission
readiness through cost effective acquisition that achieves compliance and sound management of
the AF‘s financial, natural, and energy resources. Through the P2 methodology outlined below,
AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  39


all AF organizations making purchases or product specifications for purchases will use the GPP
as a routine part of day-to-day purchasing activities to reduce resource consumption and solid
and hazardous waste generation.
6.5. P2 Methodology. Organizations at all levels of the AF shall use the P2 hierarchy at Table
6.1 to select objectives and targets to eliminate, reduce, or manage the impacts of their
significant aspects. Solutions adopted by the application of P2 methodology should not shift or
increase risk in other areas, such as operations, safety, and/or health.

Table 6.1. P2 Methodology.




6.6. P2 Opportunity Assessments (P2OAs). P2OAs integrate the study of all the
environmental aspects of all media associated with a process that generates pollution. Focusing
 40                                                           AFI32-7001 4 NOVEMBER 2011


on the entire process allows identification of multiple potential opportunities for the various sub-
processes.
   6.6.1. Use P2OAs to examine the significant environmental aspects that generate pollutants.
       6.6.1.1. Identify pollutant sources by examining the materials entering a process (or are
       part of the process) and the wastes and other pollutants generated by it (type and volume).
       Potential options for changing the process, such as alternative chemicals/materials and/or
       procedures (e.g., media blasting vs. chemical paint stripping), are examined against the
       current process to determine if a more environmentally friendly (and cost effective)
       approach can be taken.
       6.6.1.2. Consider a cost-benefit analysis when evaluating potential P2 opportunities. The

       MONITORING AND MEASURING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

7.1. Overview. Environmental monitoring and measuring is part of the EMS Check phase. The
purpose of environmental monitoring and measuring is to increase leadership awareness of
compliance issues; identify and analyze trends of non-compliance; identify areas for
improvement; provide lessons learned to prevent similar non-compliance at other installations;
and to minimize or avoid environmental litigation risks. For effective EQ program management,
identify, report, and track appropriate written and verbal correspondence. MAJCOMs and
installations will conduct monitoring, measuring, and/or assessments for activities mandated by
legal and/or other administrative requirements (such as permits, plans, and written programs).
Information gathered by the monitoring activities support installation and HHQ record keeping
and performance reporting. Guidance published by HQ USAF and the MAJCOM provide
specific monitoring and measurement requirements and may be included in installation EMS
Action Plans. For additional information, refer to the AF/A7C Portal and AFI 32-7047. Perform
the activities as shown in Figure 7.1.

Figure 7.1. EMS Performance Monitoring Phase.




7.2. ESOHCAMP – Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Compliance
Assessment and Management Program. Appropriate facilities will conduct compliance and
EMS conformance assessments, and track preventative/corrective actions according to AFI 90-
803, which describes the three-tier assessment process.
7.3. EMS Conformance. Conformance is the measure of an installation‘s adherence to ISO
14001 and the requirements established by HQ USAF and supplemented by MAJCOMs and/or
the implementing organization. The Installation Commander or ESOHC Chair formally declares
conformance to the AF EMS requirements every three years after an external assessment has
been conducted and major non-conformances have been corrected.
7.4. NIA Monitoring. Major installations and CONUS ranges shall assess their NI assets and
consider the assessment results in their EMS. NIAs identify the capability and capacity of the NI
to support the mission. Furthermore, data analysis reveals trends in NI availability and
sustainability. Consider NIA findings during the installation‘s annual aspect inventory review
and the EMS management review. Specific information is contained on the AF/A7C Portal.

7.5. Performance Monitoring. Appropriate facilities shall establish, implement, and maintain
a procedure(s) to monitor and measure, on a regular basis, the key characteristics of its
operations that can have a significant environmental impact.
   7.5.1. Installations shall track operational performance using established OSD, HQ USAF,
   and MAJCOM-level performance measures. Installations shall also develop their own
   installation-specific performance measures designed to achieve installation unique objectives
   and targets. By incorporating these performance measures into the Action Plans and
   ensuring their inclusion in the EMS management reviews, organizations shall focus priority
   actions on those areas critical for improved performance.
   7.5.2. The organization shall ensure that calibrated or verified monitoring and measurement
   equipment is used and maintained according to AFI 21-113, Air Force Metrology and
   Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program, and shall retain associated records.
7.6. Corrective and Preventive Action. Appropriate facilities shall implement, track, and
appropriately address corrective and preventive actions for all assessment findings IAW AFI 90-
803, and accomplish the following:
   7.6.1. Identify and correct areas of non-conformance or non-compliance (i.e., ESOHCAMP
   findings or Enforcement Actions (EAs)), and take action(s) to mitigate their environmental
   impacts.
   7.6.2. Define responsibility and authority for handling and investigating non-compliance and
   non-conformance.
   7.6.3. Define who is responsible for mitigating any impacts caused by the non-compliance
   and non-conformance.
   7.6.4. Define responsible POCs for initiating and conducting corrective and preventive
   action.
   7.6.5. Ensure corrective actions taken are appropriate to correct the non-compliance and
   non-conformance.
   7.6.6. Incorporate and record any changes due to corrective and preventive actions on the
   documented procedures requiring change.
   7.6.7. Review the effectiveness of corrective action(s) and preventive action(s) taken.
   7.6.8. Conduct a root cause analysis and identify countermeasures necessary to keep the
   condition from reoccurring.
7.7. Legal Compliance Tracking and Reporting. AF installations shall track and report non-
compliance with applicable federal, state, local, DoD, and AF, environmental laws and
regulations IAW AFI 32-7047.

level of services, key performance indicators, environmental compliance, programming, and
training requirements.
Appropriate Facility—Any facility subject to compliance with environmental regulation or
conducts activities that can have an impact on the environment, either directly or indirectly,
individually or cumulatively, due to the operations of the facility‘s or organization‘s mission,
processes or functions.
Asset Management (AM)—Use of systematic and integrated processes to manage natural and
built assets and their associated performance, risk, and expenditures over their life cycles to
support missions and organizational goals.
Capability—The attributes required to achieve operational effectiveness through a combination
of regulatory compliance, management system conformance, and asset capacity.
Capacity—The ability of natural infrastructure and workforce assets to meet operational
requirements. Assets that lack sufficient capacity are thought to be resource deficiencies and
subject to denial of use, while assets with excess capacity are considered to provide resource
opportunities.
Conformance—The measure of EMS‘s correspondence with PE of the ISO 14001 standard and
those requirements established by HQ USAF and supplemented by MAJCOMs and/or the
implementing organization.
Cross-Functional Team (CFT)—Group of SMEs representing key organizations to include
operations, maintenance, safety, environment, occupational health, transportation, ranges, and
any others deemed critical for development and execution of ESOH initiatives. Typically, it also
includes military, civilian, and contractor personnel from all levels of the organizations. A
deputy group commander or higher will chair the team. He or she may wish to contact facility
tenants, non-AF entities, and other units to serve on the CFT. The team is given broad
objectives, but not specific directives. Decision-making within the team is usually based on
consensus.
CFT Chair (Management Representative)—No lower than a deputy group commander. The
CFT Chair is the specific management representative who, irrespective of other responsibilities,
shall have the responsibilities and authority for ensuring that EMS requirements are developed,
implemented, and maintained; and will provide reporting to the ESOHC on the performance of
the EMS, including recommendations for improvement.

Final Governing Standards (FGS)—A set of country-specific substantive provisions (not
procedural), typically technical limitations on effluent, discharges, etc. or a specific management
practice.
Foreign Country—Any land, water, or airspace that is subject to competent exercise of
jurisdiction by one or more foreign governments or international organizations; a nation,
territory, or geographic area that is outside the customs territories of the US.
Government-owned, contractor operated (GOCO)—A facility that is owned by the
Government and operated under contract by a non-government, private firm.

activity for effectiveness. Reference MIL-STD-882D, Department of Defense Standard Practice
for System Safety, and DoDD 5000.01, The Defense Acquisition System, for appropriate
guidance.
Organizational-level EMS—A EMS that contains only those elements that are necessary for the
organization to carry out certain necessary functions for setting and transmitting objectives and
targets to lower units and for collecting, packaging and reporting on accomplishments and
compliance. It will seldom contain all the elements of an ISO 14001-conforming EMS. It is also
not necessary that each of the elements conform to the ISO 14001 specifications. In recognition
of this, the Office of the Federal Environmental Executive has exempted organizational-level
EMSs from the Federal requirement for periodic Declaration of Conformance. Only facility-
level EMSs (including multi-site EMSs) must continue to comply with that requirement. (See
reference guidance on ‗higher-tier EMS‘ issued by the Office of the Federal Environmental
Executive on 31 October, 2008: Guidance on Implementing Environmental Management Systems
“At All Appropriate Organizational Levels” of a Federal Agency pursuant to Executive Order
13423.)

US, a foreign country or territory.
Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD)—The OEBGD is a set of
objective criteria and management practices developed by the DoD, pursuant to DoDI 4715.5. It
specifies the minimum criteria for environmental compliance at permanent DoD installations at
overseas locations where no FGS have been established. It is designed to protect human health
and safety and reflects generally accepted environmental standards applicable to DoD
installations and activities in foreign countries. The OEBGD is used to develop and update
country-specific FGS for all DoD components located in that host nation.
Overseas Installation—A facility or group of facilities at a fixed geographical location under
the control of a DoD component, and other facilities designated by a Unified Combatant
Commander, base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the
Secretary of a Military Department that is located outside the U.S. and outside any territory,
commonwealth, or possession of the United States.
Pollution Prevention (P2)—Source reduction and other practices that reduce or eliminate the
amount of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants entering the waste stream or
otherwise released into the environment prior to recycling, treatment, and disposal; reduces the
hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances,
pollutants, or contaminants; and, increases efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water,
or other resources; or protection of natural resources by conservation.
Regional Counsel Office (RCO)—A part of AFLOA/JACE imbedded with the AFCEE/RO and
responsible for providing environmental law support to installations, MAJCOMs, and the RO.
Regional Environmental Office (REO)—A part of AFCEE responsible for providing program
guidance. The Eastern REO covers Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions 1-4; the
Central REO covers EPA Regions 5-8; and the Western REO covers EPA Regions 9-10. The
REOs do not interact with host nation environmental regulatory agencies, but can provide
technical assistance to overseas MAJCOMs and installations.

Risk—An expression of the impact and possibility of a mishap in terms of potential mishap
severity and probability of occurrence.
Significant Aspect—An environmental aspect that has or can have a significant environmental
impact. The significance of impacts is determined by the application of significance criteria. An
aspect is either significant or it is not significant, there is no significance gradations and no
aspect is more or less significant than another aspect. However, once selected, all the significant
aspects can be ranked either explicitly by listing them in order of priority or implicitly by varying
the resources and timeframes allocated to the achievement of objectives and targets in the EAPs.
Site— Any single parcel of land, regardless of size, used and maintained by a DoD Component.
Subject Matter Expert (SME)—An expert in EMS subject matter usually located at AFCEE or
AFCESA.
Sustainability—To create and maintain conditions under which humans and nature can exist in
productive harmony that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present
and future generations.
Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM)—Principle used to ensure a calculated
level of investment targeted to preserve and improve all infrastructures, including natural
