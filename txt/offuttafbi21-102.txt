1. General
     1.1. The CDDAR program applies to all United States Air Force (USAF) host and tenant
     organizations and is designed to recover crashed, damaged or disabled aircraft in a minimum
     time period consistent with the following consideration(s):
        1.1.1. Open runway for operational use.
        1.1.2. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
        1.1.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap or accident investigations IAW AFI 91-202.
            1.1.3.1. WARNING: Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure
            may cause serious injury or death to those in contact with it. Technical Order (TO)
            00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information
            (Emergency Services) contains information regarding aircraft-specific composite
            component locations, and should be consulted when responding to aircraft incidents.
            Contact base Bioenvironmental Engineering and the transient aircraft’s home base to
            determine composite material risks and requirements for Personal Protective
            Equipment (PPE).
            1.1.3.2. WARNING: Ensure that it is safe to approach the aircraft, all explosives,
            ejection seat cartridges, tires, fluids, flares, and munitions are de-armed, expended, or
            otherwise proclaimed safe by the fire department and/or Explosive Ordnance
            Disposal (EOD).
            1.1.3.3. WARNING: Due to the many unknown factors of airframe condition
            immediately following a crash landing, do not attempt to use special equipment or
            procedures not included in the specific aircraft technical orders, or without approval
            of the specific airframe system manager/engineer. The owning agency of any
            transient aircraft will be contacted for technical advice pertaining to the specific
            aircraft.
            1.1.3.4. WARNING: Make sure the aircraft remains stable at all times and that
            personnel use extreme caution when working in and around a disabled aircraft.
            Before any ground handling activities take place on or around the aircraft, CDDAR
            personnel will ensure that it is properly stabilized to prevent movement or shifting. It
            may be necessary to moor the aircraft or stabilize using air bags.
            1.1.3.5. CAUTION: The aircraft and crash site will be disturbed only to the extent
            required to eliminate any potentially dangerous situation to the aircraft, support
            equipment, or personnel, and will remain in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is
            released to maintenance by the Incident Commander (IC).
2. Terms
     2.1. Crashed Aircraft: An aircraft unable to return to designated or alternate field or missed
     landing resulting in major or total destruction of the aircraft.
     2.2. Damaged Aircraft: An aircraft that cannot be moved under its own power or supported
     by its undercarriage without sustaining secondary damage.
     2.3. Disabled Aircraft: An aircraft that cannot or should not be moved under its own power,
     but can be towed using its own undercarriage.

  2.4. Disaster Response Force (DRF): IAW Offutt AFB IEMP 10-2, disaster response may
  involve the entire DRF or portions thereof, depending upon the magnitude and severity of the
  disaster. Additional support may be called upon from Local, State and Federal agencies.
  The DRF is composed of Crisis Action Team (CAT), Command Post (CP), Emergency
  Communications Center (ECC), Emergency Operations Center (EOC), First Responders,
  Emergency Responders, Unit Control Centers (UCC) , Emergency Support Functions (ESF),
  specialized teams, Recovery Operations Chief and Sr. Military Representatives. For specific
  contact information, refer to AFI 10-2501 & Offutt AFB IEMP 10-2.
  2.5. IC: The IC is responsible for all incident activities, including the development of
  strategies and tactics and the ordering and release of resources. The IC has overall authority
  and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is responsible for the management
  of all incident operations at the incident site. All responders report in accordance with
  procedures established by the IC to receive mission assignments. The IC shall be fully
  qualified to manage the response.
  2.6. Off-base Response: IAW Offutt AFB IEMP 10-2, off-base responders must observe the
  jurisdictional rights of civilian authorities and private citizens. Off-base accidents may
  require the establishment of a National Defense Area (NDA), approved by 55 WG/CC, to
  permit control of civilian property by military forces. Even after establishment of the NDA,
  close coordination with civil law enforcement agencies is essential to ensure an effective
  security program.
  2.7. The CDDAR Team: Also, known as the crash recovery team, is an indigenous
  specialized team for emergency response organization purposes. The crash recovery team is
  not considered a permanent part of the DRF because it has functional responsibilities beyond
  emergency response and not all disaster responses involve crash recovery. The crash
  recovery team shall support the emergency response operations of the DRF that require the
  recovery of an aircraft following a major accident or an aircraft-related mishap, whatever the
  category, classification or circumstances. Appoint enough team members to conduct 24-hour
  operations.
  2.8. The CDDAR Team Chief: CDDAR Team Chiefs, in addition to the IC and Incident
  Safety Officer, are responsible for the safety of the CDDAR team members and is
  responsible to 55th Maintenance Squadron (MXS) supervision and the IC. The CDDAR
  Team Chief is the subject matter expert on aircraft recovery operations and equipment. Refer
  to AFI 21-101 for CDDAR Team Chief qualification and training requirements.
  2.9. CDDAR Team Members: All personnel listed on the CDDAR team roster shall be
  qualified to conduct CDDAR recovery operations. Refer to AFI 21-101 for CDDAR team
  member qualification and training requirements.
  2.10. Augmentees: The recovery team may be augmented by personnel drawn from the
  general base military populace to support the recovery operation but are limited to tasks that
  do not require specialized training or skills. The CDDAR Team Chief will make requests for
  augmentees through the IC and EOC.

                 SAMPLE CDDAR TEAM CHIEF SAFETY BRIEFING

Figure A3.1. Sample CDDAR Team Chief Safety Briefing.

PURPOSE: To recover crashed/damaged or disabled aircraft in a minimum time period
consistent with the following considerations:

   1. Requirement to open the runway for operational use.
   2. To prevent secondary aircraft damage.
   3. Preservation of evidence for mishap or accident investigations.

      1. SAFETY is paramount and is the number one priority.
      2. A pre-brief is required before any recovery process/step established in the ARP.
      3. DO NOT enter mishap area until authorized by the IC.
      4. Check with Team Chief to verify aircraft is safe for maintenance.
      5. Wear your personal protective equipment.
      6. Stay out from underneath the wings and engines unless absolutely necessary.
      7. Many aircraft are constructed with composite materials; do not handle untreated
         composite materials.
      8. For some Fighter Aircraft, Hydrazine hazards exist…if these hazards are noticed, stop
         recovery actions. Notify Team Chief who will consult proper agencies for disposition.
      9. Watch out for each other, take a break when needed and stay hydrated.
      10. For any situation that might occur that has not been briefed, use ORM and bring it to
          the attention of the Team Chief.
