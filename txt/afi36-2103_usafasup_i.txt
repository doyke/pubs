                                CHECKLIST FOR SPONSOR

The first impression a newcomer gets of a base comes from his or her sponsor. The success of a
good INTRO program is tied to first impressions. Since the needs of each newcomer vary, a
sponsor must find out what those needs are and respond to them.
A3.1. Call the newcomer and tell them you're there to provide information and assistance to
make the move smooth as possible. Listen : Many times a newcomer can reduce stress by merely
talking to someone "already there." Be open and honest and stay positive.
A3.2. Remember, it's not good enough to just say "let me know what you need," anticipate their
needs.
Ask these questions:

- Will your family members accompany you? Names, ages, interests?
- Do you need information about other services? Banking, child care, education, etc.?
- Do you want me to meet you when you arrive? Date, time, location.
- Do you want a post office box?
- Is there anything else you need?
A3.3. Pick up a sponsor kit from your Orderly Room or Family Support Center. Personalize it
by taking out unnecessary information and adding information requested. Mail it within seven
calendar days.
A3.4. Include a personalized letter from your commander and your own personal letter. Include
your home and duty phone numbers and address. Remind newcomers to let you know of any
changes to their plans. Reconfirm the departure date, arrival date, and reporting-in date and
ensure member is aware of the 24 hour arrival point. Upon arrival, personally meet the
newcomer. Make the member feel welcomed.
A3.5. Visit the base housing office and get information about on- and off-base housing. If the
newcomer is interested in residing on-base, remind them to apply in advance.
A3.6. If the newcomer is single, contact the Orderly Room. If the newcomer is married or a
single parent, ask the billeting office for information about on-base guest quarters and off-base
facilities. Offer assistance where needed.
A3.7. After the newcomer's arrival, help arrange for in-processing. Take the newcomer to the
orderly room and duty section. Continue to provide assistance as necessary. Offer to show the
newcomer around the base and local area.
