This instruction implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) Supplement 1, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. It identifies the
conditions that would require, and prescribes procedural guidance for, the impoundment of unit
aircraft/equipment. It also identifies responsible agencies in the event an impoundment becomes
necessary. Actions directed in this instruction ensure the preservation of mishap evidence. This
instruction applies to all 934th Airlift Wing (AW) personnel involved in the impoundment of
aircraft and equipment. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System       (AFRIMS)        Records       Disposition     Schedule       (RDS)    located     at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The changes to this instruction were made to eliminate duplication of higher directives stated in
AFI 21-101, AFRC Sup 1, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
1. General. Any 934 AW personnel involved in or witnessing an incident involving damage or
injury must remain at the scene until released by the on-scene commander or Impoundment
Official (IO). The Base Legal Office will be consulted for legal advice as appropriate.
2. Conditions Warranting Impoundment.
 2                                                             934AWI21-114 21 AUGUST 2013


     2.1. In addition to the mandatory events listed in AFI 21-101 and AFMAN 91-223,
     impoundment of aircraft/ equipment will also be directed when:
        2.1.1. Unusual operating performance or system malfunction is experienced,
        2.1.2. An airdrop incident results in personal injury or aircraft/equipment damage,
        2.1.3. An airdrop malfunction or an off-drop zone (DZ) drop occurs,
        2.1.4. A system malfunction repeats for the third time,
        2.1.5. Infestation of insects, rodents or similar conditions are evident. The Maintenance
        Operations Center (MOC) will contact Host Base Civil Engineer Entomologist for
        possible quarantine.
     2.2. Aircraft may be impounded if any of the following conditions are apparent:
        2.2.1. Engine controls bind,
        2.2.2. Flight control problems occur in the “direct manual” mode or when “auto” mode
        fails to disengage,
        2.2.3. Other discrepancies or malfunctions considered to be unusual or requiring further
        investigation.
3. Roles and Responsibilities.
     3.1. Impoundment Official (IO). The IO will be the authority to determine whether to
     relocate the impoundment exhibits or if such actions will compromise the investigation. For
     airdrop malfunctions, the Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Chief of Tactics will typically
     assume IO duties.
4. Procedures. Whenever impoundment occurs, regardless of the reason, the following actions
are required:
     4.1. MOC will initiate the Aircraft/Equipment Impoundment Checklist.
     4.2. MOC will create a “Red X” discrepancy using a Job Control Number starting with the
     Julian date and ending with 8479 through 8499.
     4.3. If possible, the aircraft will be secured in its recovered state to preserve evidence.
     Propellers may be positioned with the number one blade in the twelve o’clock position and
     taken “out-of-feather” during periods of cold weather if, in the opinion of the IO, it would not
     interfere with the subsequent investigation.
     4.4. QA will report all incidents of multiple-engine power loss to AW/SE. The report will
     include specific values of RPM, torque, fuel flow, Turbine Inlet Temperature, and other
     related power plant indications.
     4.5. Release of Impoundment. After the investigation has been completed and the most
     probable cause is identified and corrected, the Impoundment Release Authority will clear the
     impoundment entry in the applicable forms (AFTO Form 781A or AFTO Form 244). The
     MOC will be notified and the aircraft/equipment will be released.
5. After Normal Duty Hours. The Night Shift supervisor or designated representative will
ensure the intent of this AWI is met to the maximum extent possible. The aircraft will be
secured and a boxcar seal placed on the crew entrance door. The seal number will be written in
934AWI21-114 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                  3


ink in the AFTO Form 781A impoundment entry discrepancy block and the aircraft forms placed
inside the aircraft prior to the seal installation. Only the assigned IO may remove this seal.
6. Airdrop Malfunctions. Airdrop malfunctions will be investigated by 934 OSS (Tactics)
and/or a designated Joint Airdrop Inspection (JAI)-qualified loadmaster using procedures in AFI
13-210, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction Investigations, and Activity Reporting,
and AFI 11-2C-130V3, Ch10/934 AW Sup 1. The IO will contact the 27th Aerial Port Squadron
(APS) for disposition of airdrop equipment still onboard the aircraft.
