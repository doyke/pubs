                                                 Chapter 1

                                     PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE

1.1. Program Overview. The Air Force Library and Information System (AFLIS):
1.1. (ACC) Program Overview. See AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility, Para A3.3, for
the role of the Services Flight Chief in the library program.
    1.1.1. Provides access to information essential to the Air Force mission.
    1.1.2. Supports professional military and voluntary education programs.
    1.1.3. Offers library facilities, resources, and services to enhance the quality of life for authorized
    customers.
    1.1.4. (Added-ACC) ACC libraries partner using the ACC Integrated Library System to meet the
    program overview for Air Force Library and Information System (AFLIS). Team competencies
    include managing information organizations; managing information resources; managing information
    services and applying information tools and technologies.

1.2. Opening New Libraries. Installation commanders or commanders of specialized organizations
send requests to establish a library or information center to the Major Command Services Commander or
Division Chief (MAJCOM/SV). Libraries with an Air Force Library Account Number (FL) require a
full-time professional librarian to receive central appropriated funds, services, and support.
    1.2.1. MAJCOM/SV reviews and verifies the requirement, provides technical assistance, and coordi-
    nates the request with MAJCOM Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) monitor.
    MAJCOM DoDAAC monitors forward the request for an FL account number DoDAAC, a six posi-
    tion code that uniquely identifies a unit, activity, or organization that has the authority to requisition
    and/or receive material, to the Air Force DoDAAC monitor at HQ AFMC. Approved libraries receive
    a Supply Record Account Number (SRAN) and a DoDAAC. DoDAACs are issued IAW AFI 24-230,
    Maintaining the DoD Activity Address Directory (DoDAAD) and DoD 4000.25-6-M, Part I, Depart-
    ment of Defense Activity Address Directory (DoDAAD) (Activity Address Code Sequences). If the
    library is a contract operation, the base must appoint an accountable property officer other than a con-
    tract employee.
    1.2.2. Commander or division chiefs may not establish new libraries, branches, or information cen-
    ters unless they demonstrate that existing library operations on the base cannot provide required ser-
    vices. Commanders of units that do not have a professional librarian authorized on the manning
    document and are not located on an Air Force base submit requests for library service through the
    MAJCOM to HQ AFSVA/SVPAL.
    1.2.2. (ACC) Requests for a library account number will require a written justification to include
    manpower requirements, proposed real property facility to include facility number and address, fund-
    ing requirements, hours of operation, a mission statement, population to be supported, current method
    of meeting information requirements, alternatives explored, reason for this requirement, and justifica-
    tion of why the service cannot be provided by an existing library.

1.3. Closing and Consolidating Libraries. If organization commanders intend to close a library due to
a Base Realignment and Closure commission decision, or to consolidate FL account numbered activities,
AFI34-270_ACC_I 24 OCTOBER 2006                                                                          7


they must send notifications a minimum of six months prior to the proposed action. The request must be
sent through MAJCOM/SVs and AFSVA/SVPAL.

1.4. Authorized Libraries. Libraries are authorized at each installation and, as Category A activities, are
mission sustaining programs IAW DoDI 1015.10, Programs for Military Morale, Welfare, and Recre-
ation (MWR). See Attachment 3 for library and information activities and services that make up the
multi-type AFLIS.
1.4. (ACC) Authorized Libraries. Requests for library extension services require the same written jus-
tification as opening a new library. Funding requirements as well as funding avenue for resources must be
identified.

1.5. Customer Eligibility. See AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility. The installation
commander determines specific eligibility requirements.
   1.5.1. Non-Department of Defense (DoD) personnel enrolled in an Air Force or DoD sponsored edu-
   cation program may use library services when required by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
   and when showing proof of current enrollment.
   1.5.2. Air Force government contractor personnel are eligible to use Air Force libraries in accordance
   with contract requirements and AFI 34-262, Attachment 2, paragraph A2.2. Foreign military person-
   nel are eligible for library participation in accordance with support agreements.
   1.5.3. (Added-ACC) See AFI 34-262, Table A2.1 for the suspension, termination and denial of priv-
   ileges.
   1.5.4. (Added-ACC) Eligible library customers must register with their base library in order to
   access the ACC Library System network for out reach services and databases.

1.6. Services Awards Program. See AFI 36-2852, Air Force Services Awards Program.

1.7. Assistance To Other Libraries. All Air Force Libraries are an integral part of the worldwide
library and information network. As such, they provide assistance to other non-Air Force libraries and
organizations for the purpose of furthering access to and use of the ever-expanding body of worldwide
scientific, literary and educational knowledge and information. This global partnership occurs through
cooperative activities such as interlibrary loan, resource sharing, and reference support.

        LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTER OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Program Standards. Operate libraries and information centers to meet published professional stan-
dards and guidelines (Attachment 4) and current industry practices. Only general libraries must meet the
standards defined in the DoD MWR Library Standards (DoDLS); AFI 36-2306, The Education Services
Program Education Assessment Program (EAP); and standardized AFLIS EAP checklist. The Golden
Eagle Standards for Air Force General Libraries are mandatory (see USAF/ILV message, R151211Z
Mar 99) and provide minimum standards for Air Force general libraries. The AF Library 5-Star Program
uses key Golden Eagle Standards to determine quality of service provided to customers.
2.1. (ACC) Program Standards. An ACC checklist for “Air Force Golden Eagle” standards is available
through the ACC Command. Compliance with “Air Force Golden Eagle” standards is mandatory.

2.2. Public Services. All libraries provide services based on customer needs identified in the Services
Market Survey data from marketing offices and other marketing methods, library program objectives, and
the AFLIS Strategic Plan as supplemented by the MAJCOM. Libraries conduct an annual review of cus-
tomer satisfaction and analyze results for needed changes in library operations, facilities, equipment, and
services. Libraries provide the following services:
2.2. (ACC) Public Services. Annual customer satisfaction surveys will be conducted for each area of the
tri-fold library program - general, mission and education customers. General surveys will be conducted
according to Air Force Services Agency Libraries Branch (HQ AFSVA/SVPAL) guidance. Academic
surveys will be conducted to determine student satisfaction with library programs and services for Mili-
tary Installation Voluntary Education Review assessments. Mission surveys will be conducted to meet
mission needs. Survey results, and changes initiated as a result of feedback will be reported in each like
section of the Library Annual Report Narrative. Base libraries located on an installation with associated/
tenant units extend public services to these customers in accordance with the AFLIS Procurement Guide.
    2.2.1. Two-way interlibrary loan (ILL) and resource sharing services. Adhere to the ILL Code for the
    United States. Libraries are authorized to charge ILL costs to a centrally funded account. Each library
    will have a written ILL policy and ensure that all ILL requests conform to the requirements of local
    lending protocol and the copyright law. Libraries maintain records of ILL requests and their fulfill-
    ment for three calendar years after the request is made IAW guidelines from the Commission on New
    Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works.
    2.2.2. Document Delivery services. Utilize document delivery services for articles not available in
    the library collection. Libraries are authorized to use AFLIS centrally funded document delivery
    accounts when available. Librarians track document delivery costs by mission and organization, edu-
    cation or personal needs, and follow procedures on the AFLIS Resources web page.
    2.2.3. On-line access to commercial and government information and bibliographic databases.
    Librarians track information delivery costs by mission and organization, education, or personal needs
    to justify budget requirements.
    2.2.4. General libraries provide support services in the areas listed below. Academic and technical
    libraries support the parent organization’s mission.
AFI34-270_ACC_I 24 OCTOBER 2006                                                                         9


  2.2.4. (ACC) Libraries must provide professional-full time-reference librarian services to support
  mission, education, and personal research. Libraries partner with the Langley ACC Information
  Research Service Center (IRSC) to insure customers have access to all reference services and digital
  content. Langley IRSC staff are professional degreed librarians and information specialist providing
  digital command information services. Base libraries also participate in the command Library Net-
  work to meet program objectives.

     briefings for commander’s calls, research, interlibrary loan, document delivery services, reference
     support, online database access, and publications.
     2.2.4.1. (ACC) Mission support services. Langley IRSC staff collaborate with base libraries to
     create digital libraries of mission-essential information for select functional areas. Langley IRSC
     librarians manage the full life cycle of information from addition to deletion. Information is based
     on a deep understanding of clients’ information needs and learning, work and/or business pro-
     cesses. Digital libraries integrate externally and internally created information resources to create
     new functional-area-specific information collections and services.
     2.2.4.2. Education support services. Libraries provide academic support IAW DoDI 1322.25,
     Voluntary Education Programs. Include research skill and orientation classes, reserve collections,
     reference librarians, and coordination of off-campus library support. Libraries shall operate a min-
     imum of 55 customer service hours per week. Thirty percent of operating hours will be night (after
     1700 hours) and weekend hours to accommodate student needs.
     2.2.4.2. (ACC) Education support services. Base library staff educate and train base personnel for
     both professional and personal development. Classes are offered on information tools and technol-
     ogies, information literacy, internet usage, as well as locating and interpreting information
     sources. Classes will also cover web search engines, advanced searching, and information analysis
     for authenticity.
     2.2.4.3. Quality of life support services. Include all programs and services that enhance the qual-
     ity of life for military members and their families. Provide full library service to children and
     youth, including story hours and summer reading programs. Promote lifelong learning.
  2.2.5. Class A, defense switched network (DSN), defense data network (DDN), and commercial busi-
  ness telephone lines with routers and modems for data transmission, and time-share access to support
  on-line reference and resource sharing. Library staff computers should be connected to the base local
  area network (LAN) and added to the base Combat Information Transport System (CITS) plan for
  fiber optic connectivity to ensure reliable access to electronic, mission-essential information.
  2.2.6. Customer use equipment, including but not limited to: computers, printers, office software,
  typewriters, audio and video equipment, copiers, fax machines, electronic book readers, and scanners.
     2.2.6.1. Personal use of library computer resources by customers is authorized. See AFI 33-112,
     Computer Systems Management, paragraph 19. Libraries must follow guidelines IAW DoD

        2.2.6.1. (ACC) Customer signage should be posted advising customers on the provisions/policy
        for copyright and security issues before using library automated data processing equipment/pro-
        grams.

2.3. Facilities. General libraries and service centers must meet space criteria and design standards speci-
fied in DoD Military Handbook 1190, Facility Planning and Design Guide; AFI 32-1024, Standard
Facility Requirements; AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements; GES; and most current DoD and AF
Library Design Guides. Mission and organization for academic and technical libraries or information cen-
ters determine space criteria and design standards. Use current industry standards to develop
state-of-the-art facility requirements.
2.3. (ACC) Facilities. The document, Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-740-20F Design: Libraries,
provides guidance for evaluating, planning, programming and design during construction phases of devel-
opment for library facilities and Learning Resource Centers (LRC).
     2.3.1. Libraries follow guidance for temperature and humidity control as outlined in DoD Military
     Handbook 1190. Request waivers locally as required to meet specifications for operation of equip-
     ment and for preservation of materials.
     2.3.2. Library facilities will not be used to provide office, work, or storage space for functions not
     specifically related to library services, with the exception of a room that may be used for non-library
     meetings. All other uses are subject to installation commander approval and MAJCOM librarian
     review.
     2.3.3. Libraries are authorized appropriated fund custodial support and should be identified in the
     base contract for custodial support IAW DoDI 1015.10, Enclosure 6, MWR Program APF Support
     Table Authorization, and AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support to Morale, Welfare, and Recre-
     ation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities.

2.4. Library Collections. Library Directors determine the size and scope of their collections by assess-
ing the quality and currency of materials, customer needs, funding, staffing, and physical space. Librari-
ans follow these general guidelines:
     2.4.1. General library collections must include materials to support organizational mission require-
     ments, professional military and voluntary education programs, lifelong learning, and quality of life
     for adults and children. Libraries are authorized lease or rental plans for materials to meet demand for
     new missions, special initiatives, newly published items, and to enhance quality of life programs.
     2.4.2. Select library materials using subject specialist input, professional journals, bibliographic
     tools, and collection analysis. Also use ILL indicators, weeding factors, customer requests, and mar-
     ket surveys for collection development.
     2.4.3. Provide information in print, non-print, and electronic formats.
     2.4.4. Emphasize access to information and materials rather than the size of the collection. Use
     on-line databases, DVD/CD-ROM full-text products, interlibrary loans, and document delivery ser-
     vices when these resources prove cost-effective and practical.
     2.4.5. Follow the American Library Association (ALA) Bill of Rights to ensure that the selection pro-
     cess is free from censorship. Libraries will also apply the principles of intellectual freedom, not only
     in selection, but also in all aspects of library service, by implementing the Interpretations of the
AFI34-270_ACC_I 24 OCTOBER 2006                                                                          11


   Library Bill of Rights, the Privacy Act, and the procedures for handling complaints set forth in the
   Intellectual Freedom Manual and updates from the ALA Office of Intellectual Freedom. Adherence
   to federal regulations must take precedence.
   2.4.6. Establish a written collection management policy to ensure that collections meet customer
   needs; evaluate collections regularly to eliminate old, obsolete, and worn materials; and establish and
   implement an inventory plan using professional methods. Establish and update the collection develop-
   ment plan annually and include subject areas weeded, collection strengths and weaknesses, and col-
   lection goals. Forward the plan and annual updates to the MAJCOM librarian for approval.
   2.4.6. (ACC) Collection development plans shall include a collection conspectus analysis sheet. At a
   minimum, analyze the number of holdings, turnover, and age for each Dewey classification. Submit
   the data sheet annually to the ACC Library Office (HQ ACC/A1NB) by November 15th. Maximum
   per capita holdings should not exceed three items per capita.
   2.4.7. Special, scientific or technical library, and technical information center collections must pro-
   vide current, in-depth materials in direct support of the parent organization's mission.
   2.4.8. Determine academic library collections by curricula and accreditation standards.

     training.

2.6. Technical Services. Libraries use modern technology and centrally contracted services to acquire,
catalog, and process materials.
     2.6.1. Libraries use centrally funded cataloging service contracts or On-line Computer Library Center
     (OCLC) services for catalog cards or electronic records and enter holdings in the OCLC On-line
     Library Union Catalog (OLUC). Other cataloging services may be used upon approval from HQ
     AFSVA/SVPAL.
     2.6.1. (ACC) Library holdings must be downloaded to the On-line Computer Library Center (OCLC)
     database and the library OCLC holdings code added to collection items for Interlibrary Loan. Book
     holdings in the ACC library system should be a mirror image of OCLC holdings tapes for disaster
     recovery purposes.
     2.6.2. General libraries use the Dewey Decimal System of Classification for materials and Library of
     Congress (LC) subject headings. Automated cataloging systems must use the standard full
     machine-readable cataloging (MARC) record format.
     2.6.3. Technical and academic libraries normally use the LC classification system for books. Techni-
     cal reports from most agencies are cataloged in the Committee on Scientific and Technical Informa-
     tion (COSATI) format, following COSATI cataloging rules.
        2.6.3.1. Small technical libraries may use the Dewey Decimal Classification system.
     2.6.4. Purchase preprocessed books and use copy cataloging and centrally funded contracts to save
     staff time and reduce costs. Establish cataloging and book-processing profiles with appropriate ven-
     dors.

2.9. Marketing and Public Relations. Library directors conduct aggressive marketing and public rela-
tions programs to promote library services and use, as well as to obtain funding, staffing, facility improve-
ment, grounds maintenance, responsive procurement action, and community involvement. Directors of
general libraries use Services Market Survey data to identify market trends and to develop a marketing
plan. General libraries are authorized marketing support IAW AFI 34-104, Services Marketing and Pub-
licity Program.
AFI34-270_ACC_I 24 OCTOBER 2006                                                                        13


2.9. (ACC) Marketing and Public Relations. Marketing Plans and Management Action Plan (MAP)

impact to the program and quality performance improvements resulting from library marketing. AFI
33-117, Multimedia Management (MM), Para 2.5. authorizes work orders for multimedia support to
libraries using an AF Form 833, Multimedia Work Order.

2.10. Accountability Records. Libraries maintain property custodian records, requisition and purchase
orders, salvage and inventory control documents, written follow-ups, and memos in official files in accor-
dance with AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN 37-139,
Records Disposition Schedule, Table 34-3.
   2.10.1. Accountable Property Agent. The organization commander appoints a professional librarian
   as the accountable property agent for all library materials and services in a memorandum. For contract
   libraries, the base must appoint an accountable officer other than a contract employee. The Services
   commander or division chief, or the commander of a specialized organization with a library or infor-
   mation center, appoints an interim accountable property agent during periods when there isn't an
   assigned librarian. Keep original documents with the AF Form 194, Library Balance Record. Send
   one copy of each memorandum to the MAJCOM librarian whenever a new librarian or interim
   accountable property agent is appointed.
       2.10.1.1. Libraries operating under a NAFI MOA and contract libraries are responsible for
       accountability of library materials and equipment in accordance with the terms of the NAFI Mem-
       orandum of Agreement, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Statement of Work (SOW), or
       other document describing NAFI responsibilities and work to be accomplished.
   2.10.2. Library Balance Records. Libraries without an automated Integrated Library System (ILS)
   use AF Form 194 to document collection acquisitions and withdrawals. Use a separate form for each
   type of material. Libraries with an ILS generate reports at the end of each fiscal year (FY) or when
   needed which provide a chronological record of each type of material added to or removed from the
   collection.
   2.10.2. (ACC) Library Balance Records. Process materials and make available for circulation within
   30 workdays. Bulk end-of-year buys resulting in work overload for staff members require a timeline
   for staff processing to be completed.
   2.10.3. Shelf List Records. Librarians keep an official shelf record for every item in the permanent
   collection in either card or automated format. The permanent collection consists of items purchased
   with central or local library funds as well as donated items that have been officially added to the
   library balance record.
   2.10.3. (ACC) Shelf List Records. Place leased audio and books in circulation within 48 hours of
   receipt.

   customer Internet access.

3.3. Central Appropriated Funds. All libraries and information centers are authorized the use of cen-
tral APFs except Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) libraries funded with 3600
funds. HQ AFSVA/SVPAL allocates central APFs to libraries through their MAJCOMs to purchase
materials and services in direct support of Air Force mission requirements, library missions, and profes-
sional and voluntary education programs. See paragraph 4.8. and the instructions in LEOS for types of
materials and services that libraries may fund with central APFs.

  colleges and universities to contribute funds for library systems specialists, communications lines,
  computers and equipment, user group fees, training of library staff, Internet and contractual fees to
  regional library systems. ACC libraries support the EAP partnership with full reference services. The
  formal review of the partnership is conducted by Military Installation Voluntary Education Review
  (MIVER) assessment teams. The MIVER Project has two purposes: (1) to assess the quality of
  selected on-base voluntary education programs, and (2) to assist in the improvement of such education
  through appropriate recommendations to institutions, installations and the military services. The
  MIVER project provides an independent third-party assessment of the quality of the postsecondary
  education program provided to off-duty Service members at ACC military installations.
