                                      MISSION PLANNING

Section 2A—-General

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members and the operations and intelligence functions of fighter organizations. Accomplish
sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution, to include fuel requirements, map
preparation, and takeoff/landing data.
2.2. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BWC are defined in AFI 91-
202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike
Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques. The OG/CC will determine local BASH procedures.
     2.2.1. Takeoffs, landings, or low-levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the
     phase II period increase likelihood of birdstrike. Significant bird hazards are published in
     FLIP GP, the IFR Supplement and local airfield guidance.
     2.2.2. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, pilots will make
     appropriate judgments based on observable bird conditions and seek assistance from local
     airfield personnel.
     2.2.3. Pilots will consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to
     minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on
     United States Avian hazard Advisory System (http://www.usahas.com), provides BASH
     information, including regionalized CONUS bird migration, PFPS software overlay, and
     latest news. See AFPAM 91-212 for additional information.
2.3. Standards. The OG/CC may publish and approve group or wing standards. Operations
Group Stan/Eval (OGV) will review all standards for AFI 11-series compliance prior to
publication.
2.4. CBRNE. Procedures for operation in a CBRNE-threat environment are contained in
Attachment 2.
2.5. Flight Material Preparation.
     2.5.1. Mission Data Card (MDC). The minimum TOLD requirements on the MDC are:
     2,000 foot acceleration check speed (if computed takeoff roll exceeds 2,500 feet); refusal
     speed (dry/wet); rotation speed; takeoff speed; takeoff distance; normal landing speed and
     distance (dry/wet); heavyweight (immediately after takeoff) landing speed and distance
     (dry/wet). If computed takeoff roll is less than 2,500 feet, evaluate aircraft performance by
     comparing actual takeoff distance to computed takeoff distance or use a 1000’ acceleration
     check speed.
     2.5.2. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
     divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
     remain within assigned training areas.
     2.5.3. Enroute Charts. Pilots may substitute FLIP enroute charts for maps on navigational
     flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                        9


   2.5.4. Low Altitude Maps.
       2.5.4.1. On low altitude flights, each pilot will carry a current map (updated using Chart
       Update Manual or electronic equivalent) of the route/operating area. It will be of such
       scale and quality that the detail of terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations permits
       navigation and safe mission accomplishment. Circle/highlight manmade obstacles at
       above planned flight altitude within 5nm of the planned route. Annotate time or distance
       tick marks and headings.
       2.5.4.2. Annotate route abort altitude (RAA) using the IFR Off Airways guidance in AFI
       11-202V3 chapter 8.
       2.5.4.3. For flights inside the Continental United states (CONUS) under Visual Flight
       Rules (VFR) or inside Military Training Routes (MTR), comply with the following:
          2.5.4.3.1. Use FLIP AP/1B and either sectional aeronautical charts or mission
          planning software (e.g. PFPS/Falcon View/JMPS). Select the following overlay
          options for PFPS/Falcon View: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways,
          MTR, parachute jump and special use airspace boundaries.
          2.5.4.3.2. Annotate Low level charts, or locally developed low-level route books ,
          with location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, military airfields, civil
          airfields, and other potential high density traffic areas (e.g. parachute activity areas
          and ultra light/hang glider/glider sites) within 5 nm of any planned VFR route or
          MTR lateral boundary. Annotate airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity
          of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other
          areas of conflict.
       2.5.4.4. Outside the CONUS, follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or host nation guidance
       on mission planning. If no such guidance exists, use the best charts or flight planning
       software overlay options available to accomplish the intent of maximizing traffic
       awareness and awareness of controlled airspace boundaries.
2.6. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious
resource. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of
mission execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent
profiles. Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities.
2.7. Overwater. Plan overwater sorties outside the local training area (e.g. cross countries,
deployments, and PDM inputs) as a two-ship minimum. The OG/CC may approve exceptions.
2.8. Briefing and Debriefing.
   2.8.1. All flight members will attend the briefing unless previously coordinated with
   unit/squadron supervisors. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing to
   promote a safe and effective mission. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the
   capabilities of each pilot in the flight. Any item published in CAF/wing/group/squadron
   standards or AFIs and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard."
   2.8.2. Flight leads must plan adequate time to discuss required briefing items depending on
   complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities, and must start flight briefings at least 1.5
   hours before scheduled takeoff. Alert briefings will start in sufficient time to be completed
   prior to pilot changeover. Items may be briefed in any sequence, provided all minimum
10                                 AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


  requirements listed in this AFI and AFI 11-202v3 are addressed. Additional time and CRM
  emphasis is required in D-model sorties especially on FAM and Incentive flights. Passenger
  must demonstrate oxygen regulator use, ability to establish multiple airways and mask
  removal after being strapped in. Reference Attachment 3 for example briefing guides. All
  flight briefings will include:
     2.8.2.1. Weather and NOTAMs
     2.8.2.2. Emergency procedures
     2.8.2.3. Mission priorities and task management
     2.8.2.4. Significant rules (e.g. SPINS, Training Rules, ROE).
     2.8.2.5. Flight member responsibilities and deconfliction contracts. Flight leads will
     brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every phase of flight.
  2.8.3. Low-level Briefing. Emphasize:
     2.8.3.1. Obstacle/terrain acquisition and avoidance, bird hazards, emergency actions and
     weather avoidance with route abort procedures.
     2.8.3.2. Employment of all controlled-flight-into-terrain protection features, e.g.
     Automatic Low Altitude Warning (ALOW)/Line in the Sky (LIS)/Ground Collision
     Avoidance System (GCAS).
     2.8.3.3. Human factors to include task prioritization, g-excess illusion, and perceptual
     issues associated with flight over water/featureless terrain.
     2.8.3.4. Airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as
     well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict.
  2.8.4. Dissimilar Formation Briefing. Emphasize proper position to ensure wingtip
  clearance, flight member responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of
  flight.
  2.8.5. Alternate Mission/Events and Multiple Go Days.
     2.8.5.1. Brief an alternate mission for each flight that is less complex than the primary
     mission. Unbriefed missions/events will not be flown. Mission elements may be
     modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads
     will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. Continuation training (CT)
     missions may fly primary or alternate missions in any sequence.
     2.8.5.2. During deployed operations, exercises, or multiple-go days when aircraft turn
     times do not allow follow-on mission brief(s), if all flight members attend an initial flight
     brief, the flight lead need only brief any changes for subsequent flights.
     2.8.5.3. On multiple-go days, subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity.
     Schedule and plan upgrade events on the first sortie only. If that sortie is non-effective
     for weather, maintenance or airspace IPs may elect to accomplish the planned upgrade
     events in the second sortie.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                    11


   2.8.6. Debriefing.
       2.8.6.1. All missions will be debriefed and address in-flight execution, flight member
       responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities, and sensor
       management.
       2.8.6.2. Flight leads will review the video/audio record of all tactical portions of the
       sortie to assess flight members’ AGSM effectiveness. It is imperative to evaluate not
       only during the G-ex, but also after the pilot has had time to fatigue--typically when the
       AGSM breaks down and G-induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) occurs. Pilots with
       poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be identified to the operations officer.
       The squadron commander has the option of directing refresher centrifuge training in
       accordance with AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
2.9. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids. Unit developed checklists used in lieu of
flight manual checklists must contain all items, verbatim and in order, unless specifically
addressed in the flight manual. Pilot aids will contain:
   2.9.1. Briefing guides (reference Attachment 3 for examples).
   2.9.2. Local radio channelization.
   2.9.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, to include cable/net barrier information.
   2.9.4. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists,
   NORDO procedures, divert information, search and rescue procedures, etc).
   2.9.5. Divert base cable and barrier information.
   2.9.6. Bailout and jettison areas.
   2.9.7. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine documentation,
   Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing.
   2.9.8. Other information as desired such as: stereo flight plans, turn procedures, local
   training areas, instrument preflight, and alert setup procedures.

Section 2B—Night (see also night sections of Chapter 3, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6)

2.10. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). Compute the MSA for each leg of the intended route of
flight in accordance with AFI 11-202V3.
2.11. Night chart requirements. Minimum requirement is a Form 70 or chart/map containing
headings, RAAs, MSAs, and maximum/minimum route structure altitudes.
2.12. Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra Red for Night (LANTIRN) Navigation
Pod Operations. For brevity, the remainder of this AFI will refer to operations using this pod as
Terrain Following Radar (TFR) Operations. For these purposes, TFR will presume use not only
of the TFR element of the pod, but also the Navigation Forward-Looking Infra Red (NFLIR)
imagery.
   2.12.1. TFR Planning.
       2.12.1.1. Bank angles. Plan turn point bank angles using realistic system limitations,
       not to exceed 45 degrees.
12                                AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


     2.12.1.2. Letdown Corridors. To the maximum extent possible, select letdown points
     that avoid initial descent into rugged or mountainous terrain. Compute primary and
     alternate entry point TF letdown corridors, Recovery Initiation Altitudes (RIA), altitudes
     for terrain at 1 NM, and altitudes for commanded level off.
  2.12.2. TFR Briefing. Emphasize ensuring the LANTIRN system is fully operational,
  transitioning to low altitude, and TF maneuvering limitations.

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 3A—Ground Operations

3.1. Preflight.
   3.1.1. (B/D model aircraft) when the rear cockpit is occupied by other than a fully
   qualified F-16 pilot, place the stick control switch in the FWD position.
   3.1.2. Do not carry baggage/equipment in an unoccupied rear cockpit; in the avionics bay
   behind the cockpit; or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area (turtle back).
   3.1.3. Do not place objects in or on top of the engine intake.
   3.1.4. Secure publications, maps and personal items to avoid flight control/ throttle
   interference.
   3.1.5. Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) except when using Aircrew Eye and Respiratory
   Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE). If flying
   with the COMBAT EDGE vest, remove the port plug on the CRU-94 (if installed), stow the
   plug during flight to prevent a FOD hazard, then re-install upon completion of the sortie.
   3.1.6. Ensure ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the automatic position.
   3.1.7. Do not select CAT I on the Stores Configuration Switch with Category III
   configurations IAW T.O. 1F-16-1-2.
   3.1.8. (AFRC) Before hot pit refueling, turn targeting pod power off. After fueling, taxi
   clear of the pits before re-applying power to the pod.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. Normally, pilot and ground crew will communicate by the
intercom system during all engine start, pre-taxi and end of runway (EOR) checks. Use the
intercom system to the maximum extent possible anytime maintenance technicians are
performing "redballs" on the aircraft and for EPU checks performed in congested areas. Do not
actuate any system which endangers ground crew prior to receiving acknowledgment. Units
with an active air defense commitment may waive use of ground intercom during alert
scrambles. When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-
218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this volume. The crew chief will
repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the system.
   3.2.1. The following signals augment AFI 11-218:
       3.2.1.1. EPU OPERATIONAL CHECK. Raise two fingers and rotate hand.
       3.2.1.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CLEAR. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring
       motion.
       3.2.1.3. BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push
       forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
       3.2.1.4. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tailhook.

       3.2.1.5. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
       simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no).
       3.2.1.6. EPU ACTIVATION. Raise hand with palm open and perform shoving motion
       indicating "stay away." Then cup hands over oxygen mask indicating hydrazine vapors
       may be present.
3.3. Taxi and Arming.
   3.3.1. Taxi Interval/Speed. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.
   Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Unless mission
   requirements dictate, limit taxi speed to 30 knots, 15 knots over a raised cable, and 10 knots
   in turns.
   3.3.2. Ice/Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all
   portions of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. When ice
   and/or snow are present on the taxiway, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet
   spacing. Minimum RCR for taxi is 10. OG/CC may waive this requirement.
   3.3.3. Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures apply when the conditions in T.O.
   1F-16-1 indicate engine damage due to icing is possible.
       3.3.3.1. If conditions warrant, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Top 3 will have the first
       flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation.
       3.3.3.2. Position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start.
       3.3.3.3. An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlet for ice
       buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter
       and EOR). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations.
       3.3.3.4. Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared for take-
       off.
       3.3.3.5. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF/Top 3.
       Make an appropriate entry in the aircraft forms and qualified personnel must accomplish
       an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine.
   3.3.4. EPU Check. Do not allow maintenance technicians to approach the aircraft until the
   EPU check is complete. Use intercom or a "thumbs up" signal to indicate when safe.
3.4. EOR Inspections and Before Takeoff Checks. Place hands in view of ground personnel
while the quick check inspection and/or arming/de-arming are in progress. If the intercom
system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with
the chief and use visual signals. EOR inspections will be accomplished immediately prior to
takeoff at a designated location, usually near the end of the runway or while departing the chock
area (not required for alert scrambles). At non-USAF bases, make every attempt to coordinate
an EOR inspection with the host maintenance unit.
   3.4.1. Forward Firing Ordnance. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed
   with forward firing ordnance.
   3.4.2. Flight members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any
   abnormalities.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                        15


3.5. Flight Lineup. Consider weather conditions, runway conditions, and runway width.
Minimum spacing between separated elements/flights is 500 feet. Wingmen must maintain
wingtip clearance with their element lead. If runway width permits, lineup with wingtip
clearance between all aircraft in the flight.

Section 3B—Takeoff and Departure

3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff when the RCR is less than 10.
   3.6.2. Pilots will review takeoff data with emphasis on takeoff and abort factors such as
   short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, cable configurations and abort sequence in formation
   flights.
   3.6.3. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway single ship or 70 percent for a formation takeoff.
   3.6.4. Ensure a compatible departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings
   (including remotely operated cables). OG/CC may waive this requirement.
   3.6.5. OG/CC may approve intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate.
   3.6.6. Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50
   percent of the available runway.
   3.6.7. Centerline Stores. Start the takeoff roll beyond a raised approach end cable unless
   runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross weight or cable availability dictate
   otherwise. Exception: aircraft with a centerline fuel tank may takeoff across approach end
   BAK-12 arrestment cables with an 8-point tie down system.
   3.6.8. Minimum takeoff interval between aircraft/elements is 10 seconds (15 seconds for
   afterburner). Increase interval to 20 seconds minimum for join-up on top or when carrying
   live air-to-surface ordnance.
   3.6.9. After releasing brakes, aircraft/elements will steer toward the center of the runway.
   3.6.10. Formation Takeoff.
      3.6.10.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to two aircraft
      3.6.10.2. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
          3.6.10.2.1. Runway width is less than 125 feet.
          3.6.10.2.2. Standing water, ice, slush or snow is on the runway.
          3.6.10.2.3. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
          3.6.10.2.4. Loaded with live munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles, 20mm
          ammunition, 2.75 rockets, AGM-88, AGM-65, and night illumination flares).
          3.6.10.2.5. Ferrying aircraft from contractor/AFMC facilities.
          3.6.10.2.6. Asymmetric loading or a difference of more than 2,500 pounds gross
          weight.
 16                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


3.7. Initial Join-up and Rejoins.
   3.7.1. Day weather minimums for VFR join-ups below a ceiling are 1,500 foot ceiling and 3
   miles (5 km) visibility.
   3.7.2. Flight leads will maintain 350 KIAS until join-up is accomplished unless mission
   requirements necessitate a different airspeed. Pilots may delay AB cancellation to establish
   closure on lead or lead element.
   3.7.3. Battle damage/bomb check will be accomplished on RTB, when practical (i.e. weather
   prohibits accomplishing BD check). This check is mandatory after expending any ordnance
   (including 20mm ammunition).
   3.7.4. Accomplish air-to-air systems checks above 10,000 MSL when practical.
   3.7.5. For further join-up procedures, see Night Operational Procedures (Section 3E) and
   Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4).

Section 3C—-Enroute

3.8. Air Refueling.
   3.8.1. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10). Lead/IP will announce when an upgrade
   or requal pilot is in the formation, and will request a qualified (non-student) boomer.
   3.8.2. Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g. KC-
   10, KC-135) for the first time.
   3.8.3. Quick flow procedures are authorized and will be conducted IAW aircraft-specific
   T.O. 1F-16X-1.
3.9. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC)/Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.9.1. The following are the minimum altitudes for the prescribed maneuvers.
       3.9.1.1. Confidence Maneuvers/Advanced Handling - 10,000 feet AGL, except dive
       recovery maneuver (15,000 feet AGL minimum entry altitude).
       3.9.1.2. Horn Awareness and Recovery Training series (HARTS) numbers 1, 2 and 3 -
       10,000 feet AGL.
       3.9.1.3. HARTS series numbers 4 and 5 - 15,000 feet AGL.
       3.9.1.4. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during aerobatic maneuvering.
   3.9.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices/jet wash. If unavoidable, the aircraft should be
   unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G.
   3.9.3. Do not manually extend the trailing edge flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft
   performance. EXCEPTION: Trailing edge flaps may be manually extended during intercepts
   performed by air sovereignty tasked unit aircraft, or during low/slow (below 5000’ AGL)
   VID training, on targets traveling at less than 200 KIAS.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                       17


   3.9.4. Do not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance. Examples
   are: transfer fuel to alter center of gravity (CG), manual pitch override (MPO) to gain
   additional negative G or assaulting two limiters at low airspeed.
   3.9.5. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed
   warning tone. When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take action to correct
   the low speed condition.
   3.9.6. The following is guidance for Horn Awareness and Recovery Training Series
   (HARTS) (reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16):
       3.9.6.1. HARTS maneuvers will be flown in CAT-1 loaded aircraft only.
       3.9.6.2. In F-16 C/D Block 40-52 aircraft, do not fly HARTS maneuvers 4 and 5 unless
       in one of the following configurations: Clean, 300 gallon centerline tank, MAU-12s on
       stations 3 and 7, and/or AIM-9/AMDs on stations 1 and/or 9.
3.10. Formation, General. Flight leads and instructors will ensure contracts, roles and
responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and debriefed. Flight
members will immediately notify lead if unable to fulfill basic responsibilities, contracts or other
assigned tasks. Flight leads will avoid tasking element leads/wingmen beyond their abilities
without sacrificing basic responsibilities. Reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16 and AFTTP 3-1.F-16.
   3.10.1. The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. Wingmen will be prepared to
   take the lead when directed.
   3.10.2. In IMC, the maximum flight size in visual formation is four aircraft except when
   flying in close formation with a tanker.
   3.10.3. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
   3.10.4. Use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals, or detailed in local procedures. Initiate configuration changes for
   four-ship flights by radio call, when practical. When formation position changes are directed
   by radio, all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is
   mandatory when directing position changes at night or under instrument conditions.
   3.10.5. Flight leads will not break up flights from visual or sensor formations until each pilot
   has a fix from which to navigate (visual, radar, INS or TACAN).
   3.10.6. Lead changes.
       3.10.6.1. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation is 500 feet AGL
       over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section
       3E)].
       3.10.6.2. During limited visibility conditions (e.g. night, IMC) initiate lead changes from
       a stabilized, wings level attitude [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section 3E) and
       Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4)].
       3.10.6.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further back than normal
       fingertip or route position, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast.
3.11. G-Awareness Exercises (G-Ex) (Reference AFTTP 3-3. F-16 and AFI 11-214).
 18                                 AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


   3.11.1. A G-Ex is required if planned maneuvering will exceed 5g. Accomplish the G-Ex
   day or night, only in VMC, with a discernable horizon, and only when unaided or NVG-
   aided visual cues are adequate to safely perform the maneuver. If these requirements are not
   met, omit the G-Ex and reduce mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5g.
   3.11.2. Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g. chase of a G-Ex), flight members
   will maintain a minimum of 6,000 feet separation between aircraft during G-Ex execution.
   Use on-board systems (e.g. air-to-air TACAN, Radar, data link) to establish separation prior
   to maneuver execution. The G-Ex will consist of at least two 90 degree turns (the second
   turn of the G-Ex for air-to-air sorties will be a minimum of 180 degrees). The first turn will
   be a smooth onset rate to 4-5g. Ensure proper g-suit operation and anti-g straining maneuver.
   Regain airspeed and perform the second turn at 5-7g (or as aircraft limits allow).
   3.11.3. Conduct the G-Ex in order of preference listed below to help ensure the airspace is
   clear from potential traffic conflicts. If practical, use ATC to help clear the airspace:
      3.11.3.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g. Restricted/Warning areas, Air Traffic Control
      Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MOAs and MAJCOM approved large scale
      exercise/special mission areas).
      3.11.3.2. Above 10,000 MSL outside of special use airspace.
      3.11.3.3. Inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR).
      3.11.3.4. Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
   3.11.4. Flight/element leads flying outside of CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM,
   theater or host nation guidance on airspace in which G-Ex may be performed. If no such
   guidance exists, follow the above procedures to the maximum practical extent.
   3.11.5. Film the G-Ex in HUD and in Hot Mic. Fly the tactical portion of all basic missions
   (BFM, BSA, ACM, etc) in Hot Mic to enable assessment of the AGSM.
3.12. Tactical Formations.
   3.12.1. Tactical Maneuvering. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight
   lead/lead element and they must maintain sight. Trailing aircraft/elements are responsible for
   deconflicting with lead aircraft/elements and will do so vertically when required. At low
   altitude, wingmen/trailing elements will deconflict high. Trailing aircraft/element(s) will
   maintain sufficient spacing so that primary emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns is
   on low altitude awareness and deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between
   elements. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction, but the
   flight/element lead becomes primarily responsible when:
      3.12.1.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or
      forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader (e.g., wingman becomes
      engaged fighter).
      3.12.1.2. The wingman calls "padlocked."
      3.12.1.3. The wingman calls ―blind. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back
      to the wingman once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                       19


   3.12.2. Loss of Visual (“Blind”) Procedures.
       3.12.2.1. Flight members will call blind with an altitude to the hundreds of feet, i.e.
       ―Blind 16.9‖. The visual flight member will respond with ―visual‖ and talk eyes on.
       3.12.2.2. If the other flight member is also ―Blind,‖ they will call blind with an altitude.
       Lead will be directive to ensure altitude separation is maintained and direct the
       wingman’s flow direction. Use a minimum of 500 ft (1,000 above 5,000 ft AGL) altitude
       separation. Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude. All flight members
       must visually clear their flight path.
       3.12.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind 16.9" call, then the
       flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known
       position of the other flight member/element and climb/descend if necessary. If visual
       contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive action to ensure
       flight path deconfliction. Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes and/or
       adversary blocks must be considered.
   3.12.3. Sensor formations. If SA is lost or ―Blind‖ in a sensor formation, call ―Blind‖ with
   altitude and follow the above procedures. Wingmen will strive to maintain an altitude stack
   at all times in sensor formation.
3.13. Chase Formation.
   3.13.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. All chase events may be flown by IP/Flight Examiners
   (FEs) or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP. Qualified pilots, including Initial
   Qualification Training (IQT)/Mission Qualification Training (MQT) pilots who have
   successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer
   for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized
   missions (i.e., OT&E, Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery,
   etc) and training conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1, F-16--Aircrew Training, may be chased
   by Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by
   group/squadron commanders.
   3.13.2. Procedures.
       3.13.2.1. On transition sorties, the chase aircraft will perform a single-ship takeoff. In-
       flight, the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must maintain nose-tail
       separation. The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. In
       the traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe performance.
       3.13.2.2. A safety observer in chase will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail
       clearance out to a range of 1 NM, from which he can effectively clear and/or provide
       assistance.
       3.13.2.3. For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for ensuring frag
       deconfliction is maintained for his aircraft.
3.14. Show Formation. Such formations will be specifically briefed and flown IAW applicable
directives. Refer to AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial Events, and applicable
MAJCOM or ANG directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in
static displays and aerial events.
 20                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


3.15. Low Altitude Operations (reference AFTTP 3-1. F-16 and AFTTP 3-3.F-16).
   3.15.1. Airspeed and Altitude. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300
   KIAS and the minimum altitude is 500 ft AGL (or IAW approved step-down training). For
   night or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is the MSA (see AFI 11-202V3) unless
   operating under TFR procedures or NVG Procedures.
   3.15.2. At low altitude, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted attention, knock-
   it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL).
      3.15.2.1. For F-16s equipped with GCAS ―PULLUP‖ command capability, when a
      PULLUP-PULLUP‖ warning sounds, the pilot will take immediate action to ensure
      terrain clearance, while referencing the primary flight instruments.
      3.15.2.2. F-16’s with pilot-selectable GCAS Minimum Terrain Clearance (MTC) settings
      will set an altitude that does not result in ―PULL-UP‖ warnings at normal operational
      altitudes. Minimum MTC is 50 feet for strafe and visual bombing, and 125 feet for all
      other operations. Wings with significant tall trees in the operating area or VR routes will
      account for average tree height when setting MTC altitudes.
   3.15.3. Weather. Consult FLIP for minimum weather on a VR or IR route. For low altitude
   training outside the CONUS, comply with theater/host nation guidance.
      3.15.3.1. Deteriorating weather on a VR Route.
          3.15.3.1.1. Able to maintain VMC. If it becomes apparent that weather ahead will
          not permit continued flight on the VR, maintain VMC, slow down, maneuver to exit
          the route structure, and establish a VFR hemispheric altitude.
          3.15.3.1.2. Unable to maintain VMC. Climb to briefed deconfliction altitudes
          (reference Chapter 2). Squawk applicable (IFF/SIF) modes and codes and contact a
          controlling agency to pick up an IFR clearance if required. Maintain preplanned
          ground track.
   3.15.4. Obstacle/terrain Avoidance. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral
   separation from known vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight
   leads will immediately direct a climb NLT 3 NM prior to the obstacle to an altitude that
   ensures vertical separation.
   3.15.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead.
   3.15.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G on the aircraft and do not
   exceed 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright bunting
   maneuvers.
   3.15.7. TFR Operations during the Day. In order to train for TFR at night, comply with
   applicable portions of Section 3E Night. Vision Restriction Devices (VRD) will only be
   worn while conducting daytime TFR training. When a VRD is in use, a safety observer must
   be present. A safety observer is defined as a crewmember qualified in that aircraft in the rear
   cockpit of a two-place aircraft or another aircraft flying in the chase position. The chase
   aircraft must maintain continuous visual contact and have two-way radio communication
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                      21


   between aircraft. During training with a VRD, pilots are cleared to fly no lower than they are
   certified to fly during night TFR.

Section 3D—-Recovery and Landing

3.16. Gear Checks. For a VFR straight in, call gear down no later than 3 mile final. For an
instrument approach (reference Chapter 4), call gear down at the final approach fix or published
glide slope intercept point. For an overhead, call gear down departing the perch. For a SFO or
FO, call gear down at base key.
3.17. Angle of Attack (AOA). Final approach will normally be flown at 11 degrees AOA.
Pilots will compare the computed final approach airspeed with AOA.
3.18. Landing restrictions. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the
available runway, land at an alternate if possible. When the RCR at the base of intended landing
is less than 10, land at an alternate if possible. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g.,
MA-1A, 61QS11).
3.19. Desired touchdown point and spacing.
   3.19.1. The desired touchdown point is 500 feet from the aim point. The aim point for a
   VFR approach is the threshold. The aim point for a precision approach is the glide path
   interception point. To avoid possible speedbrake or nozzle damage, touch down either past a
   raised approach-end cable, or 500 feet prior to the cable. With centerline stores, touchdown
   will normally be past an approach-end cable. Circumstances that may dictate landing prior to
   the cable include runway length, wind, runway condition (wet or icy), gross weight or an
   aircraft malfunction where full normal braking may not be available. Single-ship or
   formation landings with centerline stores may be made across BAK-12 arrestment cables
   which have been modified with an 8-point-tie-down system.
   3.19.2. Touchdown spacing behind an aircraft while flying a 13 degree approach will be a
   minimum of 6,000 feet due to susceptibility of the aircraft to wake turbulence and
   speedbrake/tail scrapes. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft
   is 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (e.g. F-16 following F-16), 6,000 feet for dissimilar fighter
   aircraft (e.g., F-16 following F-15) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base,
   whichever is higher. When wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds or when landing
   with a light tail wind, spacing should be increased.
   3.19.3. All aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold side when
   speed/conditions permit.
3.20. Low Approaches.
   3.20.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
       3.20.1.1. IP/FEs flying chase position: 50 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.2. Formation low approaches: 100 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.3. Chase aircraft during an emergency: 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
 22                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


   3.20.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude until
   crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climbout
   procedures or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.21. Touch-and-Go Landings. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3. Do not fly
them with live or hung external ordnance or with fuel remaining in any external tank.
3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns. Unless the OG/CC determines that local conditions (e.g.
threat condition, populated areas) dictate otherwise, do not fly overhead patterns with
unexpended heavy-weight ordnance (larger than BDU-33).
3.23. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted if the following conditions are met:
   3.23.1. Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.
   3.23.2. Specific procedures have been developed locally and coordinated with appropriate
   air traffic control agencies.
   3.23.3. The flight consists of a maximum of four aircraft (aircraft/elements more than 6,000
   feet in trail will be considered a separate flight).
   3.23.4. No aircraft offset from the runway in the direction of the break (the intent is to avoid
   requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind).
   3.23.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.24. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. An element low
approach may be followed by a sequential closed with controller approval. Plan to arrive on
downwind at 200-250 KIAS.
3.25. Back Seat Approaches and Landings.
   3.25.1. An upgrading IP may only accomplish back seat landings when an IP is in the front
   cockpit.
   3.25.2. During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the
   area, monitor aircraft parameters/configurations and be prepared to direct a go-around or take
   control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary.
3.26. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.26.1. Aircraft must be symmetrically loaded. Consider symmetrical as those stores
   loadings which do not require an abnormal trim or control application to counter a heavy
   wing or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb airspeed.
   3.26.2. Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP or flight lead qualified
   squadron supervisor is in the element.
   3.26.3. Use a rate of descent similar to a precision approach. Fly a published precision
   instrument approach if one is available. If not, fly a non-precision approach or VFR straight
   in and reference available lighting systems (e.g. VASI, PAPI) for descent angle.
   3.26.4. If the crosswind exceeds 5 knots, lead will position the wingman on the upwind side.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                      23


   3.26.5. The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing. If the
   wingman overruns lead after landing, accept the overrun and maintain the appropriate side of
   the runway and wingtip clearance. Do not attempt to reposition behind lead.
   3.26.6. Do not make formation landings when:
       3.26.6.1. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.26.6.2. The runway is reported wet; or ice, slush or snow is on the runway.
       3.26.6.3. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.26.6.4. Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the approach
       end of 125 feet wide runways (excluding overrun installations).
       3.26.6.5. Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live bombs.
       3.26.6.6. The weather is less than 500 foot ceiling and 1.5 miles visibility (or a flight
       member's weather category, whichever is higher). This applies to chased approaches and
       formation low approaches.

Section 3E—Night (see also night sections of Chapter 2, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6)

3.27. General Night Procedures.
   3.27.1. Night Ground Operations. The anti-collision (strobe) light may be OFF and the
   position lights STEADY if they prove to be a distraction. Taxi spacing will be a minimum of
   300 feet and on the taxiway centerline. The taxi light will normally be used during all night
   taxiing. EXCEPTION: When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of an
   aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be
   visually cleared without the taxi light.
   3.27.2. Night Takeoff. Aircraft will maintain the anti-collision light ON and position lights
   FLASH for takeoffs, unless IMC will be encountered shortly after takeoff. EXCEPTION:
   For formation takeoffs, flight/element leads will turn the anti-collision light OFF and position
   lights STEADY after reaching the run-up position on the runway. During a night formation
   takeoff, brake release, gear retraction and AB termination will be called on the radio.
   Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL
   before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
   3.27.3. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath a ceiling is 3,000 foot
   ceiling and 5 miles visibility. After join-up, the anti-collision light will be OFF and position
   lights will be STEADY for all except the last aircraft, which will keep the anti-collision light
   ON and position lights FLASH unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
   3.27.4. Position/Lead Changes. Unless operating with NVGs and/or TFR, do not change
   lead or wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. Call such changes
   over the radio and initiate them from a stabilized, wings-level attitude whenever possible.
   3.27.5. Night Break-up. Prior to a night formation break-up, the flight lead will confirm
   position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
   acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids.
 24                                 AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


   3.27.6. Night Landing. Land from the most precise approach available. Night formation
   landings will only be performed when required for safe recovery of the aircraft.
3.28. Operating with both Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and Terrain Following Radar
(TFR). When both NVG and TFR are in use, pilots may rely on one system or the other as
required in order to safely operate down to the applicable minimum altitudes. For example, with
a failed Nav FLIR but an operative TFR component of the Navigation Pod, pilots may choose to
substitute NVG (if all requirements/minimum altitudes in para. 3.29 are met) for Nav FLIR.
3.29. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures.
   3.29.1. NVG Preflight. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted/focused for the
   individual pilot using (in order of preference) the Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye
   lane, or equivalent. Reference AFI 11-301, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, 25
   Feb 2009.
   3.29.2. Cockpit Lighting. Fly with NVGs only in aircraft whose cockpit lighting
   MAJCOM designates as NVG compatible. MAJCOMs will only make such a designation if
   all control and performance instruments are sufficiently illuminated by the NVG-compatible
   lighting so as to make them immediately available to the pilot in the event they need to
   transition to instruments.
   3.29.3. Weather/Visibility/Illumination Levels/Minimum Altitudes. Reference AFI 11-
   214 and AFI 11-202V3. Cease NVG operations anytime environmental conditions degrade
   NVG performance such that briefed formation positions cannot be flown.
   3.29.4. NVG Qualifications. Do not wear NVGs in flight unless the pilot is NVG qualified
   or there is a qualified NVG IP in the flight (ratio of one NVG IP per non-NVG qualified
   pilot). F-16B/D Familiarization flights are authorized if appropriate academics are
   accomplished and an NVG IP is in the front seat.
   3.29.5. Radio Calls. All flight members will make a radio call when going ―NVGs on‖ or
   ―NVGs raised/stowed.‖
   3.29.6. Obstacle/Intra-Flight Deconfliction. When flying in route formation, only one
   flight member per element will don/doff goggles at a time. Flight leads will call turns if
   forced to maneuver while flight members are donning/doffing NVGs.
   3.29.7. Takeoffs/Landings. NVGs will be stowed or raised during takeoff until at or above
   2000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight and only in VMC. Stow or raise NVGs no later
   than 5 minutes prior to landing unless NVGs are required to handle an emergency.
   3.29.8. NVG Use during Air to Air Refueling (AAR). Stow or raise stow NVGs no later
   than the stern position and resume NVG use no earlier than boom disconnect.
3.30. Terrain Following Radar (TFR) Operations at Night.
   3.30.1. Minimum Altitude, Weather and Airspeed. The minimum altitude for TFR
   training will be the higher of VR/IR/MOA minimum altitude or pilot minimum altitude as
   certified by the unit commander IAW AFI 11-2F16V1. The minimum weather for TFR on
   an IR/VR route will be as per FLIP. Minimum airspeed for TFR navigation is 400 KCAS.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                     25


   3.30.2. INS Alignment. Do not conduct TFR operations unless the ground alignment was
   either full performance or an extended interrupted alignment with a flashing RDY/ALIGN
   (status 10).
   3.30.3. TFR Checks/Radio Calls. Verify proper operation of all technical-order-required
   systems before operating at low altitude. To the maximum extent possible, do so above
   10,000 feet MSL or within special use airspace. Set the CARA ALOW feature at 90 percent
   of the set clearance plane (SCP) or 90 percent of the command-directed minimum altitude,
   whichever is higher. Pilots may place CARA to standby or off only during air refueling
   operations. All pilots will confirm TFR and radar altimeter are on and working properly
   before descending below the MSA by calling "(Call Sign), RALT ON, TFR ON." Check
   CARA for proper operation when descending through 4,500 feet AGL. During descent,
   pilots will accomplish a 1,000 foot SCP level off prior to selecting a lower SCP.

Section 3F—Other

3.31. Targeting Pod Operations. Do not use the TGP for anything other than navigational SA
below 1000’ AGL (e.g. VID or aircraft, designation for weapons deliver).
3.32. Radio Procedures. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign (except
for wingman acknowledgment). Transmit only that information essential for mission
accomplishment or safety of flight.
   3.32.1. Radio Checks. Acknowledge radio checks, which do not require the transmission of
   specific data by individual flight members, in turn (EXAMPLE:               "2, 3, 4").
   Acknowledgment indicates the appropriate action is either complete, is in the process of
   being completed or is understood by the flight member.
   3.32.2. Clearance Acknowledgement. All flight members will acknowledge understanding
   the initial air traffic control (ATC) clearance. Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions
   when directed by the flight lead.
   3.32.3. Brevity code and other terminology will be IAW AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-
   1.General Planning, General Planning and Employment Considerations.
   3.32.4. Ops Checks.
       3.32.4.1. Monitor the fuel system carefully to identify low fuel, trapped fuel or an out of
       balance situation as soon as possible. Frequency should be increased during tactical
       maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks are required:
          3.32.4.1.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
          3.32.4.1.2. When external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty.
          3.32.4.1.3. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept.
          3.32.4.1.4. Prior to entering an air-to-surface range, once while on the range if
          multiple passes are made and after departing the range.
 26                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


       3.32.4.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, total and internal fuel
       quantities/balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system and cabin altitude. If the G-suit
       malfunctions or becomes disconnected, terminate all ACBT maneuvering until normal
       operation is reestablished.
       3.32.4.3. For formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or
       visual signal. Response will be made by radio call or visual signal.
           3.32.4.3.1. During Ops checks, ensure the fuel quantity selector knob is returned to
           the NORM position. Totalizer-only Ops checks may be used periodically during high
           demand phases of flight.
           3.32.4.3.2. For mandatory ops checks when external tanks are carried, each flight
           member will check the external tank(s) and add ―Tank(s) feeding/dry‖ to the Ops
           Check. Once the tank(s) have been confirmed and called dry, this may be omitted
           from subsequent ops checks.
           3.32.4.3.3. Do not substitute data-linked fuel status for operations checks.
3.33. Lap Belts. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the lap belt in flight due to potential
for lap belt buckle/side-stick controller/throttle interference.
3.34. Change of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of an F-16B/D must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement "You have the
aircraft." The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft." Once
assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.
EXCEPTION: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the
aircraft) will rock the wings and assume control of the aircraft, radios and navigational
equipment unless briefed otherwise.
3.35. Fuel Requirements.
   3.35.1. Joker Fuel. A briefed fuel needed to terminate an event and proceed with the
   remainder of the mission.
   3.35.2. Bingo Fuel. A briefed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below:
   3.35.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the FAF at the base of intended
   landing or alternate, if required. This fuel quantity will be the higher of what is established
   locally or:
       3.35.3.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 1,000 pounds.
       3.35.3.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,200 pounds.
   3.35.4. Minimum/Emergency Fuel. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that
   an aircraft will enter initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended
   landing or alternate, if required, with:
       3.35.4.1. Minimum Fuel:
           3.35.4.1.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 800 pounds or less.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                         27


           3.35.4.1.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,000 pounds or less.
       3.35.4.2. Emergency Fuel:
           3.35.4.2.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 600 pounds or less.
           3.35.4.2.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 800 pounds or less.
   3.35.5. Afterburner Use. Do not use AB below 2,000 pounds total fuel or established
   bingo fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight.
3.36. Radar Altimeters and Terrain Warning/Avoidance Systems.
   3.36.1. If the aircraft is equipped with such systems (CARA, DTS, PGCAS, AGCAS, etc.),
   turn them on for all flights. Set LIS altitude advisory as appropriate on all missions. (AFRC)
   GCAS will be enabled with a minimum altitude setting is 200 feet for day operations and 700
   feet for night operations; pilots will ensure that the appropriate values are set prior to takeoff.
   3.36.2. Non-TFR Operations. Set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter at the briefed
   minimum altitude or the command-directed minimum altitude, whichever is higher.
3.37. Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Do not conduct training missions when surface winds
along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady state. Do not conduct over water
training missions when surface winds exceed 25 knots steady state or when the sea state exceeds
10 feet (or 4 meters-USAFE). This is not intended to restrict operations when only a small
portion of the route is affected. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
3.38. Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF). To reduce
adverse affects on ATC radars, attempt to limit Mode IV interrogations while pointing towards
areas of known high density civilian traffic. Outside operational training airspace, maximize use
of Spot from STT or TWS versus Scan and CRM.

                                            Chapter 4

                                INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Head-Up Display (HUD) Use. Regardless of Block or OFP, do not use the HUD to
   recover from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman procedures except when
   no other reference is available. The HUD in F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft and Block 40/50
   aircraft with Operational Flight Program (OFP) 40T5/50T4 (TV Code 117/115) and later
   OFPs may be used as a primary flight reference in night/IMC conditions. The HUD in all
   other F-16 Blocks and OFPs may be used as an additional instrument reference, but not the
   sole reference, in night/IMC conditions.
   4.1.2. INS/GPS or EGI Use. The F-16 INS/GPS and EGI are approved for enroute Area
   Navigation (RNAV). Neither RNAV nor GPS approaches are authorized.
   4.1.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight requires a qualified safety
   observer in the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. The observer may occupy either seat of the F-
   16B/D provided the intercom is operable. Use the radar to aid in clearing the area. Pilots in
   F-16A/C aircraft may not log simulated instrument flight without a chase. They may fly
   multiple approaches in VMC without a chase, but will place their primary emphasis on
   seeing and avoiding other aircraft. Chase aircraft may move into close formation on final for
   a formation landing provided simulated instrument flight is terminated.
4.2. Takeoff and Initial Join-up.
   4.2.1. If weather is below 1,500 foot ceiling and 3 miles (5 km), each aircraft and element
   will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when
   departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and will
   not be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
   airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings and turn points. If task saturation occurs, cease
   attempts to maintain radar contact, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument
   procedure, then notify the flight lead. The flight lead will notify ATC.
       4.3.1.1. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC.
       4.3.1.2. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
       4.3.1.3. Normal spacing is 2-3 NM.
       4.3.1.4. Each aircraft and element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the
       aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar contact and called "tied."
   4.3.2. No Radar Contact.
       4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay
       turns to maintain the desired spacing.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                       29


     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 mile spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied."
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or
     elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and
     elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft and element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact, except in
     instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical
     separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element to
     meet the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. Radar Contact.
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with
     the preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, except
     to acknowledge ATC instructions, unless radar contact is lost.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e. radar,
     TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures.
     4.3.4.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL or AB power until reaching 350
     KIAS (or as required by local procedures). Upon reaching this speed, the flight leader
     will set a pre-briefed power setting. Climb at 350 KIAS until reaching cruise Mach/TAS,
     unless otherwise briefed.
     4.3.4.3. Make all turns using 30 degrees of bank.
  4.3.5. En Route Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
     4.3.6.1. Trail recoveries are only authorized at home station, deployed locations, and
     locally designated primary divert bases. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve and
     local operating procedures must address trail recovery procedures. As a minimum,
     procedures must address each recovery profile, missed approach, climb-out, desired and
     maximum spacing requirements, lost contact and lost communications.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
 30                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


       4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
       or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
       whichever is higher.
       4.3.6.4. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds.
       4.3.6.5. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
       spacing.
       4.3.6.6. Prior to wingmen taking spacing for the trail recovery, the flight lead will ensure
       that all wingmen have operative navigational aids and radar.
       4.3.6.7. Accomplish flight separation IAW local directives and in VMC if possible.
       4.3.6.8. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC.
       4.3.6.9. ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
       4.3.6.10. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
       4.3.6.11. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
       comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
       4.3.6.12. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and
       configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call
       all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
       4.3.6.13. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
       4.3.6.14. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "Callsign
       (C/S) lost contact." The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and
       heading. Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC. If
       contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members
       may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If separation
       cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by ATC.
       4.3.6.15. Flight leads will coordinate with local ATC prior to penetration if the trail
       recovery will terminate in a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) or Airport Surveilance
       Radar (ASR) approach.
4.4. Formation Break-up. Formation break-up from a visual formation will occur in VMC. If
IMC is unavoidable, breakup from a visual formation will occur in straight and level flight. This
restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight lead will
confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids (reception of appropriate TACAN, ILS and/or
appropriate GPS/INS waypoint).
4.5. Formation Penetration.
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route or close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                   31


   4.5.3. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the
   base of intended landing is at or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC formation flights, do not change lead or wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind or if required during a formation
approach with an F-16 experiencing an Emergency.
4.7. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   4.7.1. Pilots will not fly any published instrument procedure (e.g. DoD, Jeppesen, ICAO)
   that requires airspeeds less than those specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1.
   4.7.2. The F-16 is Approach Category E. Use approach Category D minimums at an
   emergency or divert airfield where no Category E minimums are published, provided:
      4.7.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.7.2.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KIAS or less.
      4.7.2.3. For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed
      (KTAS) or less. At high density altitudes 260 KTAS may require a KIAS below the
      speed specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1 and Category D approaches shall not be flown.

                       AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

5.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment.
   5.2.1. Never perform simulated gun employment with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW
   T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master
   Arm switch position.
   5.2.2. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   ―ARM‖ or SMS/MFD symbology reads ―RDY,‖ do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations.
   5.3.1. Negative "G" guns jink maneuvers are prohibited.
   5.3.2. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering is 350
   KIAS.
   5.3.3. All configurations are authorized for unlimited maneuvering as defined by AFI 11-
   214. Before conducting unlimited maneuvering in a CAT III configured aircraft, consider
   gross weight, drag, departure susceptibility and training requirements.
   5.3.4. (AFRC Only) F-16D aircraft with centerline stores are prohibited from utilizing the
   Unlimited maneuvering category, as defined by AFI 11-214.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                       33

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

Section 6A—-General

6.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.
6.2. Simulated Gun Employment.
   6.2.1. Never perform simulated gun employment (squeezing the trigger with the Master Arm
   switch in SIM) with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). Never
   perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master Arm switch position.
   6.2.2. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   ―ARM‖ or SMS/MFD symbology reads ―RDY,‖ do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
6.3. Training Missions with a Hot Gun.
   6.3.1. Pilots will not select strafe submode until immediately prior to roll in and will deselect
   strafe submode immediately after completing the safe escape maneuver.
   6.3.2. When firing the laser, ensure you are in a mode that will not allow the gun to fire.
6.4. Simulated Attacks against off-Range or Manned Targets. Do not conduct such attacks
with hung ordnance. Do not conduct them with live ordnance, except for 20 mm ammunition
with a safe gun. When the aircraft is loaded with expendable stores (e.g. bombs, external fuel
tanks, TERs carted at the pylon), load simulated weapons (zero quantity) in the SMS/MFD only
on empty or uncarted/unexpendable stations (EXCEPTION: Captive Maverick and HARM
missiles may be selected). Confirm the Master Arm switch is in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the
first attack. Flight lead will query and flight members will reply to a ―check zero quantity,
uncarted station‖ radio call.
6.5. Weather. In training, do not conduct climbing or diving deliveries with a ceiling below
2,000 feet AGL or level deliveries with a ceiling below 1,500 feet AGL.
6.6. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KIAS (300 KIAS
above 10,000 feet AGL).
6.7. Target Identification. Pilots shall positively identify the target prior to weapons release.
For wartime or contingency sorties, comply with ROE. For training sorties, achieve positive
identification by either visually acquiring the target or by confirming target location through
valid on-board/off-board cues. Cues may include, but are not limited to, radar, GPS, marking
rounds, IR Maverick lock on, IR pointers or NVG-compatible marking devices. Exercise caution
when relying on a single cue to confirm target location.
6.8. Safety of Ground Personnel. When ground controllers are present on Class B/C ranges,
range personnel will brief pilots on locations of these personnel and each pilot will acknowledge.
Pilots must know applicable range weapons delivery procedures, appropriate targets and
 34                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


weapons footprints. Pilots shall not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground
personnel or intended target locations.

Section 6B—-Night

6.9. Altitude. Compute an MSA for the entire bombing pattern using the IFR Off Airways
guidance in AFI 11-202V3 chapter 8. The minimum altitude for night High Angle Strafe (HAS)
is the Target MSA (as defined in Attachment 1) unless executed by an NVG-low qualified pilot
(as defined in AFI 11-2F-16 Vol 1) under high-illumination conditions (as defined in AFI 11-
214).
6.10. Bank Angle. Do not exceed 135 degrees of bank when returning to the low altitude
structure (<5K AGL)
6.11. TFR. If ingressing under TFR protection to a climbing delivery that will result in the need
to exceed TFR roll limits, cease manipulating the targeting pod no later than pull up initiation.
Focus on maintaining aircraft control. Do not resume manipulation of the targeting pod until
either above the MSA or back within TFR protection.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                      35


                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances
occur. These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual.
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction which is addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective
   actions have been accomplished.
   7.1.2. Do not fly an aircraft with a tripped engine monitoring system (EMS) Go-No-Go
   indicator (Bit Ball) until maintenance has accomplished the appropriate procedures and
   cleared the fault.
   7.1.3. Do not taxi with a known malfunction of the nose-wheel steering system, the brake
   system, or a generator [NOTE: F-16C/D aircraft may be taxied with a single generator
   failure (main or standby) if the other generator is operating normally].
   7.1.4. Once a malfunctioning aircraft system is isolated, do not use that system again unless
   its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. Do not conduct ground or in-flight
   trouble-shooting after flight manual emergency procedures are complete.
   7.1.5. In the F-16B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in-flight
   emergencies. The additional pilot will confirm that all critical action procedures have been
   accomplished and will provide checklist assistance at the request of the pilot in command.
   7.1.6. For actual/perceived flight control malfunctions, pilots will terminate maneuvering
   and take appropriate action. If the problem was due to crew/passenger stick or rudder
   interference, the pilot will take positive action to ensure no further control interference
   occurs.
   7.1.7. When a fuel imbalance exceeds dash one limits, terminate tactical maneuvering and
   investigate. If the problem was caused by a slow feeding external or internal fuel tank and
   can be corrected, the mission may continue IAW dash one guidance. If not, terminate the
   mission. Instruments, deployment missions, level weapons deliveries and straight-through-
   non-maneuvering intercepts are authorized to reduce gross weight until a safe landing is
   possible.
7.2. Critical Action Procedures (CAPs). CAPs are in ATTACHMENT 4.
7.3. Ground Aborts.
   7.3.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight lead will normally renumber the
   flight to maintain a numerical call sign sequence. Flight leads will advise the appropriate
   agencies of such changes.
   7.3.2. Pilots who do not takeoff with the flight may join the flight in accordance with the
   brief or flight lead instructions. If a join-up is to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range,
   all events will be terminated until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
 36                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


7.4. Takeoff Aborts.
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, say call sign and intentions when practical.
   Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort takeoff if adequate
   clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable" will be used to indicate a
   departure-end cable arrestment. The phrase "Barrier, Barrier, Barrier" will be used to
   indicate a departure-end net arrestment. Local procedures will address net barrier raising
   procedures.
   7.4.2. When aborting above 120 KIAS, or whenever hot brakes are suspected, declare a
   ground emergency. Taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake
   procedures.
   7.4.3. If aborting at or above 100 knots, lower the hook. If aborting below 100 knots, lower
   the hook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the remaining runway.
7.5. Air Aborts.
   7.5.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   7.5.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing.
   When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an escort for
   the aborting aircraft is required..
   7.5.3. Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, for
   any of the following:
      7.5.3.1. Bird strike
      7.5.3.2. Actual or suspected foreign object damage.
      7.5.3.3. Recovery below FRAG altitude with live ordnance.
      7.5.3.4. Moderate to severe icing.
      7.5.3.5. Over-G (NOTE: Land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach).
      7.5.3.6. Flight control system anomalies, including uncommanded departures from
      controlled flight (EXCEPTION: intentional departures from controlled flight conducted
      IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus), but not including flight control system lights that
      reset IAW flight manual procedures.
      7.5.3.7. Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown.
7.6. Radio Failure (NORDO). Reference AFI 11-205 and the Flight Information Handbook.
   7.6.1. NORDO in Formation.
      7.6.1.1. A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will
      maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member
      and give the appropriate visual signals. The mission should be terminated as soon as
      practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert base. A
      formation approach to a drop-off on final should be performed unless safety
      considerations dictate otherwise.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                     37


     7.6.1.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
     aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
     flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from
     other flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying
     clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
     signals. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
     If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to
     the base of intended landing or a divert base.                Aircraft experiencing any
     difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
  7.6.2. NORDO on a Class A Range or a Manned Class B Range.
     7.6.2.1. Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency or back up
     radio.
     7.6.2.2. If contact cannot be reestablished, make a pass by the range control tower on the
     attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. The flight lead
     will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO to a recovery base or rejoin the
     flight and RTB.
     7.6.2.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
     tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the direction
     of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to
     join-up and escort the emergency aircraft.
  7.6.3. NORDO on an Unmanned Class B Range or on a Class C Range.
     7.6.3.1. Make a pass on the target maintaining normal pattern spacing, if possible, while
     rocking wings. The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO
     aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight in sequence and recover. If the NORDO
     aircraft has an emergency, if practical, it will make a pass on the target maintaining
     normal pattern spacing, rocking wings, turn opposite direction of traffic and proceed to a
     recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the
     emergency aircraft.
     7.6.3.2. Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances preclude
     landing with unexpended ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished
     provided the following conditions are met:
     7.6.3.3. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact with
     the RCO and the remainder of the flight.
     7.6.3.4. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO
     aircraft to initiate jettison.
  7.6.4. NORDO during Missile or Air-to-Air Gunnery Firing.
     7.6.4.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
     7.6.4.2. If radio failure occurs, safe the armament switches, join on another member of
     the flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph 7.6.1
     7.6.4.3. Gunnery target tow aircraft experiencing radio failure will rock wings and
     continue the turn if an attack is in progress. The flight lead of the attacking aircraft will
 38                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


       join on the tow's wing. Remain clear of the banner in the event it is cut. The tow pilot
       will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight lead will signal when
       the banner is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the banner is
       away and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, he will take the lead,
       RTB with the tow aircraft on the wing, advise the tower of the NORDO and establish the
       appropriate landing pattern. If cable remains, follow local procedures.
   7.6.5. NORDO during Recovery.
       7.6.5.1. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
       the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
       aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
       wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
       7.6.5.2. To signal the need for an approach-end arrestment, lower the tailhook (visual
       formation) or fly a straight in approach flashing the landing light (unescorted).
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not fly through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
will split-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration.
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). SD has proven to be a leading killer of F-16 pilots. Although
SD is most common at night or in IMC, it can and has happened in day VMC. Reference
AFMAN 11-217V1 for information on the causes of SD, how to avoid it, and how to mitigate its
consequences.
7.9. Lost Wingman.
   7.9.1. Priorities. The first priority is to establish safe separation from other aircraft (e.g.
   tanker or wingman). Next, obtain a separate clearance to ensure obstacle/terrain clearance
   and clearance from other traffic.
   7.9.2. Prohibitions. Do not practice lost wingman procedures in other than day VMC
   conditions.
   7.9.3. General Procedures. Simultaneously transition to instruments and inform lead while
   executing lost wingman procedures (ref AFTTP 3-3.F16 for amplifying data). Lead will
   acknowledge the radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed. Once lost
   wingman procedures have been executed, permission to rejoin must be obtained from the
   flight lead.
   7.9.4. Two- or Three-Ship Flights. (NOTE: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost
   wingman procedures.)
       7.9.4.1. Wings-Level Flight (climb, descent or straight and level). Simultaneously
       inform the leader and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume
       heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.4.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank for 15
       seconds and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
       resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.4.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
       inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                     39


      separation and obtain a separate clearance. The leader may resume turn only when
      separation is ensured.
      7.9.4.4. Precision/Non-precision Final. The wingman will momentarily turn away to
      ensure clearance, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure
      while obtaining a separate clearance.
      7.9.4.5. Missed Approach. The wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
      clearance, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
      procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. Obtain a separate
      clearance.
   7.9.5. Four-Ship Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures would provide safe separation, but since it is impossible for number 4 to
   immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the leader, it is imperative
   that number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become
   separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined above. Number 4 will
   follow the appropriate procedure listed below:
      7.9.5.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 30
      degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for 30
      seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
      increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the leader to roll out. Obtain a separate
      clearance. Leader will resume turn only when separation is ensured.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.10.1. General. Do not attempt to expend ordnance using a weapons release system with a
   known malfunction. If abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight occurs, have the
   launching aircraft visually inspected by a chase pilot, if possible, to determine if any damage
   has occurred.
   7.10.2. Inadvertent Release. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and
   impact point, if known, and provide the information to debrief personnel. Check switches
   safe and do not attempt further release in any mode. Treat remaining stores as hung and
   obtain a chase aircraft for RTB, if practical. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard,
   jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.3. Hung Freefall Ordnance or Missile Hangfire/Misfire. First confirm
   switches/Option Select Button (OSB) settings were correct. If they were, record all relevant
   switch/OSB settings and proceed as follows.
      7.10.3.1. Hung Live Freefall Ordnance. Attempt delivery using an alternate delivery
      mode, if applicable. If unsuccessful, use selective jettison procedures for the store. If
      unsuccessful and the ordnance is either unsecure or the security of the ordnance cannot be
      determined, consider selective jettison of the rack.
      7.10.3.2. Hung Practice/Inert Freefall Ordnance. Make an additional attempt to
      expend. If unsuccessful, select an alternate delivery mode and try again. If unsuccessful,
 40                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


       ordnance from other stations/dispensers may be released provided this does not violate
       load symmetry limits. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable
       area on a single pass, if practical.
       7.10.3.3. Maverick Missile Hangfire. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft
       is a hangfire. If able, have a chase pilot inspect such a missile.
       7.10.3.4. Maverick Missile Misfire. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate
       switches were selected is a misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch. If able,
       have a chase pilot inspect the missile for smoke or fire. If either exists, jettison the
       missile on the range. If not, pilots may attempt another pass. If the second attempt fails
       and conditions permit, remain dry in the pattern for 15 minutes, then proceed to the
       recovery base following hung ordnance/weapons malfunction recovery procedures.
       7.10.3.5. Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery Procedures. Visually
       inspect the aircraft for damage, if practical. Declare an emergency (not required for hung
       practice/inert ordnance or for live unexpended ordnance). Obtain a chase aircraft, if
       available. Avoid populated areas and trail formations. Land from a straight-in approach.
7.11. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Reference AFI 11-202V3. A simulated
emergency procedure is any procedure that produces an effect closely paralleling the actual
emergency. One example would be retarding the throttle sufficiently to emulate the performance
of an aircraft with a flamed out or idle engine.
   7.11.1. Prohibitions. Do not practice aborted takeoffs in the aircraft. Instead, use the flight
   simulator, Cockpit Familiarization Trainer or a static aircraft, in that order of preference. Do
   not practice in-flight engine shutdown. Do not practice SFO patterns unless crash rescue is
   available and either an active tower or a ROM (or equivalent, e.g. SOF) is in operation. Do
   not practice SFO patterns in conditions other than day VMC.
   7.11.2. Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Patterns. OG/CCs will establish
   specific procedures for SFO training and establish letters of agreement with appropriate
   agencies. They will publish those procedures in their supplement to this volume. General
   SFO procedures follow:
       7.11.2.1. The SFO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that will ensure
       the aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely
       complete the approach.
       7.11.2.2. Do not initiate or continue an SFO if a potential traffic pattern conflict exists
       that would require division of the pilot’s attention between the SFO and sequencing with
       traffic. Discontinue an SFO whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a
       result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections. Discontinue an SFO if unable to
       obtain wings level on final by 200 feet AGL. Discontinue an SFO if airspeed drops
       below Dash One minimum airspeed any time between base key and the initiation of the
       flare. Once the decision to discontinue an SFO has been made, initiate a go-around and
       do not attempt to resume the SFO.
       7.11.2.3. Except when operating IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus (e.g. AFMC high
       angle of attack training), do not touch down from an SFO.
       7.11.2.4. Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                       41


           7.11.2.4.1. "High Key"
           7.11.2.4.2. "Low Key"
           7.11.2.4.3. "Base Key, Gear Down, (Intentions)"
7.12. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. OG/CCs will establish specific procedures in the
unit supplement to this volume. General procedures are:
   7.12.1. Squawk. Immediately cease tactical maneuvering by executing Knock-It-Off
   procedures. Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC/GCI/AWACS of the emergency situation.
   7.12.2. Talk. Establish an On Scene Commander (OSC). Communicate the emergency
   situation and intentions immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency
   if necessary.
   7.12.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means
   available, e.g. visual ground references, TACAN, INS, EGI, ATC/GCI/AWACS, HMCS, or
   TGP. Pass this information to follow-on SAR forces.
   7.12.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of
   all possible survivors is determined. If visual contact with parachute is not maintained, allow
   approximately 1 minute per thousand feet (16 feet per second) for parachute descent. The
   OSC will establish deconfliction between all aircraft involved in the SAR.
   7.12.5. Update Bingo/Recovery Base. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to
   maintain maximum SAR coverage over survivor(s). Do not overfly bingo. Relinquish OSC
   duties to more qualified rescue forces (e.g. SANDY 1, US Coast Guard) upon their arrival.
7.13. Abnormal Operation of TFR or NAV FLIR. Honor all fly ups and allow automatic fly
ups to develop. If aural or visual pull-up warnings occur but the system does not initiate an
automatic fly up, initiate a manual one. Fly up procedures follow:
   7.13.1. Allow the system to raise the nose to the appropriate angle or do so manually
   (NOTE: using climb angles greater than 20 degrees can result in rapid airspeed bleed off and
   increased susceptibility to SD).
   7.13.2. Throttle - As required to preserve airspeed. Do not hesitate to use AB.
   7.13.3. When terrain clearance ensured, Paddle Switch - Depress and release (NOTE:
   continuing to hold the paddle switch depressed inhibits fly-up commands to the FLCS).
   7.13.4. If the system does not reset:
   7.13.5. Continue climb until at or above MSA.
   7.13.6. Level off and refer to checklist (if required).

                                            Chapter 8

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter provides a consolidated framework for wings to supplement (IAW
AFI 33-360) local operating procedures. Units composed of multiple aircraft types may publish
guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction instead of supplementing this AFI.
Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in
this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures
contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided
in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it serves
to facilitate the location of information. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each pilot.
Units may supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance:
   8.1.1. Section A. Introduction.
       8.1.1.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) General. This chapter supplements AFI 11-2F-16V3
       with guidance specific to 20 FW F-16 flying operations. This chapter must be used in
       conjunction with SHAWAFBI 11-250, the 20 FW Pilot Aid and AFI 13-212, Range
       Planning and Operations. If conflicting guidance exists between this instruction and
       other applicable publications, the most restrictive guidance applies.
       8.1.1.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Deviations. Deviations and waivers from operational
       directives outlined in this instruction must be approved by the 20 OG/CC unless an in-
       flight emergency precludes requests.
       8.1.1.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Recommendations for Change. Change proposals to this
       instruction are encouraged. Submit AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
       Publication, to 20 OG/OGV through the appropriate squadron Stan/Eval Liaison Officer
       (SELO).
   8.1.2. Section B. General Policy.
       8.1.2.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) In-flight Command Authority. The designated flight lead
       has responsibility for overall planning and execution of the mission regardless of rank or
       position of other flight members. Included in this responsibility is command authority
       over the mission conduct. Another flight member cannot assume authority unless
       delegated by the flight lead or designated on the flight orders for purposes of flight
       instruction or flight evaluation. Instructor Pilots (IPs) and Stan/Eval Flight Examiners
       (SEFEs) are flying supervisors and have full authority to prevent any unsafe act or
       operation IAW governing AFIs.
       8.1.2.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Local Airfield Operations and Procedures. SHAWAFBI
       11-250 is the primary instruction defining generic local area ground and air operating
       procedures. This supplement defines F-16 specific instructions. It is the responsibility of
       every pilot to be familiar with SHAWAFBI 11-250 as well as this supplement.
       8.1.2.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Single-Ship Missions.
           8.1.2.3.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Instrument sorties may be flown single-ship to any
           airfield approved by the Operations Supervisor within the Shaw local flying area.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                   43


        8.1.2.3.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Units conducting upgrade or specialized training
        programs IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1, F-16--Pilot Training, may fly single-ship missions
        in an F-16D to accomplish training objectives, provided an IP is onboard and the
        syllabus training can be accomplished single-ship.
        8.1.2.3.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Single-ship continuation training missions may be
        flown IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures.
        8.1.2.3.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) Other single-ship missions require 20 OG/CC
        approval. Such missions include: Senior officer administrative flights, program
        depot maintenance (PDM) inputs, static displays, incentive flights, Functional Check
        Flights (FCFs), Operational Check Flights (OCFs), and cross-country returns.
     8.1.2.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) FCF/OCF flights will be conducted IAW AFI 21-
     101_SHAWAFBSUP, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, which states
     OCFs will be scheduled as separate missions and will be flown only by experienced
     pilots.
  8.1.3. Section C. Ground Operations.
     8.1.3.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Required Equipment. Required life support equipment is
     specified in AFI 11-202V3_ACCSUP, General Flight Rules, and AFI 11-
     301V1_ACCSUP, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program. Pilots will wear the
     survival vest during actual combat operations and operational readiness
     exercises/inspections. Wear of the survival vest at other times is at the discretion of the
     pilot.
     8.1.3.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Mission Planning.
        8.1.3.2.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Flight leads will determine training currencies and
        requirements for all flight members prior to the flight briefing.
     8.1.3.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) A              weather/Notices    to  Airman       (NOTAMs)
     briefing/update is required for every flight. For quick-turns/pits/multiple flights, the
     Operations Supervisor and/or SOF will ensure pilots are informed of any significant
     changes to their initial weather briefing or airfield NOTAMs.
     8.1.3.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) IAW AFI 11-202V3_ACCSUP, without an 20 OG/CC
     waiver, the 20 FW will not conduct routine training operations when actual or forecast
     steady state surface winds in the local or operating area exceed 35 knots over land, or
     when steady state surface winds exceed 25 knots over water or wave heights exceed 10
     feet.
     8.1.3.5. (Added-SHAWAFB) Anti-exposure suits will be worn IAW AFI 11-
     301V1_ACCSUP. Gliding distance to land is not a criteria in determining whether or not
     anti-exposure suits are to be worn. Local weather, as mentioned in AFI 11-
     301V1_ACCSUP, refers to the temperature over the water, not Shaw AFB air
     temperature.
     8.1.3.6. (Added-SHAWAFB) Flight leads will ensure desired military training routes
     (MTRs) are scheduled with the route’s scheduling authority and annotated in the airspace
     column of the daily schedule. Low Level Training Routes (LLTRs) will not be
44                                AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


     ―bootlegged‖ real-time, to ensure adequate mission planning focus and prevent potential
     conflicts with aircraft flying from intersecting LLTRs.
     8.1.3.7. (Added-SHAWAFB) The following Flight Information Publications (FLIP)
     will be carried on local training missions: High and low terminal approach books
     encompassing local area and all possible diverts, IFR high charts encompassing local
     area, IFR Supplement, and Flight Information Handbook.           Certified electronic
     publications fulfill this requirement.
     8.1.3.8. (Added-SHAWAFB) Briefings.
        8.1.3.8.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) If the flight brief start time is changed after being
        published, the flight lead will notify all flight members.
        8.1.3.8.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Flight leads are responsible for ensuring Special
        Interest Items (SIIs) and applicable FCIFs are adequately briefed before all flights.
        8.1.3.8.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Operational Risk Management (ORM). Flight
        leads are responsible for determining the particular risks associated with their
        planned/backup missions, including pilot risk factors (fatigue, experience,
        proficiency, etc.). Flight leads will ensure the Operations Supervisor is fully
        informed of mission profiles and will specifically address how increased risks will be
        mitigated on all missions, including those flown without benefit of a mass brief.
     8.1.3.9. (Added-SHAWAFB) Non-Standard Missions. Flights which do not closely
     parallel routine 20 FW missions/mission elements require approval of the Fighter
     Squadron Operations Officer (FS/DO).
     8.1.3.10. (Added-SHAWAFB) Fini Flights. All Fini Flights, including lineup and
     mission profile, must be briefed to the FS/CC or his designated representative and
     approved the day prior. Fini Flights will parallel routine 20 FW missions unless
     specifically approved otherwise.
     8.1.3.11. (Added-SHAWAFB) Incentive Flights. All incentive flight profiles must be
     approved by the FS/DO. Additional incentive flight restrictions are IAW AFI 11-
     401_ACCSUP_SHAWAFBSUP, Aviation Management and 20 FW Pilot Aid.
     8.1.3.12. (Added-SHAWAFB) Configuration Compatibility. Aircraft configurations
     that are not compatible with the planned mission, as anticipated or briefed, will be
     brought to the Operations Supervisor for immediate action.
     8.1.3.13. (Added-SHAWAFB) Step is defined as the time when all members of the
     flight are suited up with required gear in hand, and are ready to depart the squadron.
     8.1.3.14. (Added-SHAWAFB) Canopies will normally be closed immediately
     following engine start and remain closed until engine shut down. Restrictions to
     visibility for taxi may require deviations from this policy.
     8.1.3.15. (Added-SHAWAFB) Ice FOD. When an Ice FOD Alert is issued, follow
     procedures located in the 20 FW Pilot Aid. Make an AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
     Flight Data Document, write-up anytime icing is encountered.
     8.1.3.16. (Added-SHAWAFB) Taxi, End of Runway (EOR), Arm/Dearm Areas.
AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                    45


        8.1.3.16.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Prior to arming/dearming, pilots will ensure the
        master arm switch is ―OFF‖ or ―SIM‖. The pilot’s hands will be in full view of the
        arm/dearm crew and will not activate switches with EOR personnel under the aircraft
        without permission from the crew chief.
        8.1.3.16.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) When carrying live air-to-ground ordnance,
        arming, de-arm, and EOR inspections will be in the Hazardous/Hot Cargo Pad.
        8.1.3.16.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) After arming for Runway 04 departures, pilots
        will not use the high speed taxiway onto the runway if arming crews will be affected
        by jet exhaust.
     8.1.3.17. (Added-SHAWAFB) For training missions, if the ECM pod does not
     successfully time-in and Standby (STBY) status is not achieved prior to takeoff, complete
     the mission only after receiving Operations Supervisor approval. Leave the pod in STBY
     and make an AFTO 781 write-up after the flight for ―possible cold soak‖ condition. If
     the pod is discovered in the OFF position in-flight, turn the pod on. If the pod times in
     prior to descent then no cold soak condition exists. Use the same procedures above for a
     HTS pod that does not power up. The left hardpoint should be kept ON after
     troubleshooting a sick HTS pod.
     8.1.3.18. (Added-SHAWAFB) Hot Pit Refueling. Pilots will accomplish post-hot pit
     Emergency Power Unit (EPU) checks before leaving the pits, unless returning to the
     chocks for engine shutdown IAW 1F-16CM-1. Do not hot pit refuel with:
        8.1.3.18.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Less than 800 pounds of fuel remaining.
        8.1.3.18.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Fuel system malfunctions.
        8.1.3.18.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Unexpended ordnance that cannot be pinned.
        8.1.3.18.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) Fire truck not present.
     8.1.3.19. (Added-SHAWAFB) AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log,
     Procedures. All pilots will complete the AF Form 664 after receiving fuel at any out-
     base, excluding squadron deployments, and during any air-air refueling. Pilots will
     provide their aircraft’s complete tail number, including year, to the tanker if requested.
     Pilots will enter the tanker call sign and total fuel off load in the AFTO 781H, and AF
     Form 664 as appropriate. Copies of AF Form 664 are kept in maintenance debrief and in
     the aircraft forms (AFTO 781).
  8.1.4. Section D. Flying Operations.
     8.1.4.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) 2+2 formation takeoffs require 20‖ spacing between
     elements.
     8.1.4.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Off-Station Simulate Flameout Landing (SFO). 20 FW
     pilots are authorized to conduct off-station SFO training at airfields with a current Letter
     of Agreement (LOA). Airspace Management has LOAs established with the following
     airfields:
        8.1.4.2.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) McEntire JNGB.
            8.1.4.2.1.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Pilots must request SFO pattern as soon as
46                                AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


           possible after initial contact. McEntire tower is approval authority.
           8.1.4.2.1.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Overhead SFOs can be flown to Runway 14
           or 32. Straight-in SFOs will only be conducted to Runway 32.
           8.1.4.2.1.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Pilots will fly the figure 8 pattern depicted in
           the 20 FW Pilot Aid. Aircraft must remain within 3 NM of the airfield for
           overhead SFOs. Maintain below 250 KCAS in the climb to high key.
           8.1.4.2.1.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) High key altitude is 7,000 – 9,500 feet MSL.
           Low key altitude is 3,000 – 5,000 feet MSL.
           8.1.4.2.1.5. (Added-SHAWAFB) For straight-in SFOs, the pilot must have the
           field in sight by 10 DME. Pilots will report ―10 mile, straight-in SFO‖ and ―5
           mile straight-in SFO, gear down, low approach.‖
           8.1.4.2.1.6. (Added-SHAWAFB) Weather separation, spacing criteria, and
           radio terminology are the same as Shaw AFB SFO pattern.
     8.1.4.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Charleston (CHS) AFB.
        8.1.4.3.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) SFOs will only be conducted to Runway 15/33.
        8.1.4.3.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) CHS Air Traffic Control (ATC) will control SFOs
        as a Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight. The Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) portion of
        the flight plan and clearance terminates at the North/South high for a straight-in SFO
        and high key for an overhead SFO. CHS ATC may disapprove, delay, or discontinue
        an SFO at any time.
        8.1.4.3.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) The overhead SFO pattern uses 360º climbs to high
        key and descents from high key to the low approach (see Pilot Aid). CHS ATC will
        call the direction of turn. Aircraft will remain within 3 NM. Pilots will report ―High
        key‖ (7,000 - 10,000 feet MSL), ―Low key‖ (3,000 - 5,000 feet AGL), and ―Base key,
        gear down, low approach.‖
        8.1.4.3.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) For the straight-in SFO pattern, pilots will proceed
        VFR or be vectored to North high (position on a 7-10 mile straight-in final to Runway
        15 at an altitude between 7,000 and 10,000 feet) or South high (position on a 7-10
        mile straight-in final to Runway 33 at an altitude between 7,000 and 10,000 feet).
        Pilots will report ―North/South high, straight-in SFO‖ and ―5 mile straight-in SFO,
        gear down, low approach.‖
     8.1.4.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) Myrtle Beach International Airport (MYR).
        8.1.4.4.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) SFOs can be conducted to Runway 18/36.
        8.1.4.4.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) MYR ATC will control SFOs as a VFR flight. The
        IFR portion of the flight plan and clearance terminates at the North/South high for a
        straight-in SFO and high key for an overhead SFO. MYR ATC may disapprove,
        delay, or discontinue an SFO at any time.
        8.1.4.4.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) The overhead SFO pattern uses 360º climbs to high
        key and descents from high key to the low approach. MYR ATC will call the
        direction of turn. Aircraft will remain within 3 NM. Pilots will report ―High key‖

        (6,000 - 7,000 feet MSL), ―Low key‖ (3,000 - 5,000 feet AGL), and ―Base key, gear
        down, low approach.‖
        8.1.4.4.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) For the straight-in SFO pattern, pilots will proceed
        VFR or be vectored to North high (position on a 7-10 mile straight-in final to runway
        18 at an altitude between 6,000 and 7,000 feet) or South high (position on a 7-10 mile
        straight-in final to runway 36 at an altitude between 6,000 and 7,000 feet). Pilots will
        report ―North/South High, straight-in SFO‖ and ―5 mile straight-in SFO, gear down,
        low approach.‖
     8.1.4.5. (Added-SHAWAFB) Fuel Requirements.
        8.1.4.5.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) When Shaw AFB is operating single-runway-only,
        pilots will land with divert fuel to nearest suitable recovery airfield designated by the
        SOF. If an IFR alternate required, pilots will land with divert fuel to nearest suitable
        recovery airfield designated by the SOF, unless the SOF approves otherwise on an
        individual basis (weather rapidly improving, alternates changing, etc.).
        8.1.4.5.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) When an IFR alternate is required, pilots will plan
        recovery fuel to fly an approach from the initial approach fix (IAF) at Shaw AFB,
        execute a missed approach, divert, and have 1,200 pounds of fuel remaining at the
        alternate final approach fix (FAF) or on initial.
     8.1.4.6. (Added-SHAWAFB) Military Operating Area (MOA) Procedures.
        8.1.4.6.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) The 20 FW Pilot Aid contains the controlling
        agencies, scheduling agencies, and procedures for the commonly used MOAs,
        warning areas, and ranges. In-flight requests for use of a MOA should be made
        directly to the controlling ATC agency.
           8.1.4.6.1.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Pilots must be cleared for operations in a
           MOA/ATCAA by the controlling agency prior to commencing tactical
           maneuvering, and be cleared to depart the area if maintaining an IFR flight plan.
           8.1.4.6.1.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Aircraft that ―bootleg‖ a MOA will not
           interfere with scheduled sorties and will ask the controlling agency to notify them
           of any scheduled missions. ―Bootleg‖ aircraft will exit immediately if a conflict
           exists.
           8.1.4.6.1.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Flight leads will make an advisory call on the
           area discrete frequency when entering a MOA.
           8.1.4.6.1.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) When the controlling agency restricts the
           scheduled airspace (time, altitudes, or area), the flight lead will record the details
           on the Special Use Airspace/MTR Denial Report and return it to 20 OSS/OSOA,
           Airspace Management.
           8.1.4.6.1.5. (Added-SHAWAFB) IFR MOAs and all ATCAAs (Class A
           airspace) relieve the pilot of maintaining VFR cloud clearances. When cleared to
           operate in the airspace, pilots may penetrate weather once inside the confines of
           an IFR MOA/ATCAA without further clearance from ATC. Bulldog A/B,
           Gamecock B/C/D/I, and Robroy. The intent of an IFR MOA is not to conduct
           IFR operations and maneuvering but to allow the pilot in command the best

           utilization of available clear airspace. Pilots may conduct IMC tactical
           operations/training in ATCAAs, warning areas, and restricted air space IAW AFI
           11-214.
           8.1.4.6.1.6. (Added-SHAWAFB) W177 and Gamecock I information is located
           in SHAWAFBI 11-250, the        20 FW Pilot Aid, and Flight Information
           Publications Area Planning 1A.
     8.1.4.7. (Added-SHAWAFB) Bulldog A/B MOA Procedures.
        8.1.4.7.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Continuous radar service is not provided by ATC
        for flights inside the MOA. Upon acknowledgement of the block altitude clearance
        and entry into the MOA/ATCAA, radar services are terminated. normally monitors
        the published area discrete frequency. Coordinate all other frequency requests with
        prior to changing.
        8.1.4.7.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Within the area, flight leads will squawk the ATC
        assigned transponder code, and all others squawk standby unless required by ATC or
        flight lead. If ATC or the flight lead requires flight members squawk, then flight
        members will squawk the first two digits of the ATC assigned squawk plus 00. Use
        the area local altimeter given by ATC for Bulldog operations. The same procedures
        apply if entering Bulldog from an LLTR.
     8.1.4.8. (Added-SHAWAFB) Gamecock B/C/D/Robroy and Poinsett Transition Area
     (PTA) Procedures.
        8.1.4.8.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Continuous radar service is not provided by ATC
        for operations inside the MOA. Upon acknowledgement of the block altitude
        clearance and entry into the MOA/ATCAA, radar services are terminated. (Myrtle
        Beach Approach for Gamecock C) normally monitors the published area discrete
        frequency. Coordinate all other frequency requests with ATC prior to changing.
        8.1.4.8.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Within the area, flight leads will squawk the ATC
        assigned transponder code, and all others squawk standby unless required by ATC or
        flight lead. If ATC or the flight lead requires flight members squawk, then flight
        members will squawk the first two digits of the ATC assigned squawk plus 00. Use

50                                AFI11-2F-16V3_SHAWAFBSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2012


        8.1.6.2.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Declaring an Emergency. Pilots will declare an
        emergency as soon as practical to alert appropriate agencies. An emergency will be
        declared anytime crash/fire equipment may be needed or the situation requires
        recovery priority. If time and nature of the emergency permits, pilots should transmit
        call sign, nature of emergency, position, fuel remaining, armament status, and
        intentions. If unable to contact the controlling agency, squawk 7700 and transmit
        ―Mayday‖ on GUARD. When time and conditions permit, advise the SOF.
        8.1.6.2.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Recovery. Emergency aircraft will normally land
        from a straight-in approach, except when performing an FO/SFO. Emergency aircraft
        should use a SFA frequency (local channel UHF 19 when at Shaw AFB) throughout
        the landing phase. Runway 04L/22R will be used for emergency landings unless
        operational factors or runway surface conditions dictate otherwise. Tower will
        normally discontinue traffic operations to the landing runway when the emergency
        aircraft is approaching to land, to ensure traffic priority.
        8.1.6.2.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Conference Hotel Procedures. When experiencing
        an in-flight emergency that requires technical assistance from Lockheed, request a
        ―Conference hotel‖ call be established from the SOF or Operations Supervisor using
        Command Post assistance.
     8.1.6.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) Weather Recall/Divert.
        8.1.6.3.1. (Added-SHAWAFB) Current weather and expected routing delays should
        be confirmed with SOF or ATC prior to departing the initial approach fix or initiating
        an en route descent.
        8.1.6.3.2. (Added-SHAWAFB) Expect the SOF to pass recall instructions through
        ATC. Pilots will contact the SOF to acknowledge the recall and obtain guidance.
        8.1.6.3.3. (Added-SHAWAFB) If possible, advise the SOF when approaching a
        divert decision, and notify ATC when nearing divert fuel. If conditions do not permit
        timely communication, pilots will take all necessary actions to accomplish a safe
        recovery/divert.
        8.1.6.3.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) Available intermediate recovery bases should be
        considered in divert decisions when diverting below minimum/emergency fuel to a
        more distant location (i.e. landing at McEntire if above weather minimums despite
        not being the SOF-declared alternate).
        8.1.6.3.5. (Added-SHAWAFB) Upon initiation of a divert, pilots will not
        discontinue divert procedures unless directed by the 20 OG/CC.
        8.1.6.3.6. (Added-SHAWAFB) As soon as possible after commencing a divert,
        advise the SOF of destination, ETA, and any requirements/complications (low fuel,
        armament, etc.). If unable to contact the SOF, advise ATC.
        8.1.6.3.7. (Added-SHAWAFB) Contact the Shaw Command Post as soon as
        practical after landing at a divert location and relay aircraft status and contact/phone
        number information. Coordinate further support requirements through squadron
        Operations Supervisor.

       8.1.6.4. (Added-SHAWAFB) Declare an emergency if landing with known or
       suspected gun malfunction to include no response from a trigger pull.
       8.1.6.5. (Added-SHAWAFB) Secure BDU-33s that do not release normally do not
       require declaring an emergency. Follow 20 FW Pilot Aid hung ordnance procedures for
       recovery and advise SOF of ―hung secure BDU‖. Once dearmed, pilots may return to
       parking unless directed otherwise.
       8.1.6.6. (Added-SHAWAFB) Live or Heavyweight Ordnance Procedures are IAW
       SHAWAFBI 11-250 and the 20 FW Pilot Aid.

       the runway or taxiway and do not continue taxiing with the following malfunctions,
       unless directed otherwise by the SOF. Procedures are IAW SHAWAFBI 11-250 and the
       20 FW Pilot Aid.
       8.1.6.12. (Added-SHAWAFB) For aircraft with ANTI-SKID caution lights
       illuminating solely for loss of redundancy IAW the 1-F16CM-1, and that retain normal
       braking capability, the SOF may approve clearing the runway to EOR or repositioning
       out of constricted taxi routes prior to being shut down and towed.

skills to achieve a tactical air-to-air objective.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—See AFI 11-2F-16V1.
Combat Edge (CE)—A positive-pressure breathing-for-G (PPG) system which provides pilots
additional protection against high positive G accelerations experienced during flight. The system
consists of aircrew equipment (high-pressure mask, counter-pressure suit, G-suit), and aircraft
equipment (oxygen regulator, G-valve, and interfacing sense line). At 4-G and above, regulated
air and oxygen are supplied to provide automatic mask tensioning, vest inflation, and positive
pressure breathing to the mask.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—See AFI 11-2F-16V1.
Continuation Training (CT)—See AFI 11-2F-16V1.
Dissimilar ACBT (DACBT)—ACBT in conjunction with another MDS aircraft as adversary.
The connotation (D)ACBT refers to either similar or dissimilar ACBT. These connotations
correspond to all facets of ACBT (i.e., BFM, ACM, ACT).
Flight Lead (FL)—As designated on flight orders, the individual responsible for overall conduct
of mission from preflight preparation/briefing to postflight debriefing, regardless of actual
position within the formation. A certified 4-ship FL may lead formations and missions in excess
of four aircraft, unless restricted by the unit CC. A 2-ship FL is authorized to lead an element in
a larger formation.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—See AFI 11-2F-16V1.
Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN)—A navigation and
targeting system that provides tactical aircraft with a low-altitude, under-the-weather, day and
night operational capability.

    CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                   EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and
then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for
relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or
Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference AFMAN 10-
100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or
   equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
   available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and End of Runway (EOR) procedures inside it (if local
procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide
   this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
   have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
   practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
   A2.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down.
   Engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure
   ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS
   doors. Use hand signals if necessary.
   A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
   procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
   along the taxi route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a

   HAS would be available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS
   doors. If protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with
   Command and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations
   Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
   dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
   agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
   increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
   achieve complete decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings
under cover to the maximum extent possible.
