3. Responsibilities: Preserving life and property from fire is a fundamental duty of all levels of com-
mand and supervision. The most crucial ingredient in an effective fire prevention program is the com-
mander's involvement and awareness. A command is only as interested in fire protection as its
commander. Without the commander's involvement and support, the program will certainly fail regardless
of the resources applied. Every unit assigned to MacDill Air Force Base will have a fire prevention pro-
gram suited to its size and need. All personnel, including contractors and concessionaires when working
on MacDill Air Force Base, will observe fire prevention measures. Supervisors are responsible for the
enforcement of this directive in so far as it pertains to their respective building, area, and U.S. government
property. Willful violators will be subject to disciplinary action and/or pecuniary liability. Any fire hazard

        FIRE PREVENTION STANDARDS DURING CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE

A6.1. These standards shall become a part of applicable contract specifications for work to be performed
on MacDill Air Force Base. These standards apply to all construction, reconstruction, modification, dem-
olition, rehabilitation, alteration, repairs and maintenance of existing facilities. They apply to facilities
which will be constructed within the military construction program, minor construction program, opera-
tion and maintenance, or non-appropriated funds. Fires during contract performance must be prevented or
controlled. Danger from fire is usually greater during these operations other than after completion of con-
tract. Serious fires can occur due to the accumulation of combustible material or debris and the presence
of ignition sources. Basic safeguards against construction fire hazards must be provided for, or during
project planning. This standard outlines measures, which, with some pre-planning, will prevent; or at
least, minimize damage if fire occurs.

A6.2. Depending upon the size of the project, either the contractor or an individual appointed will be
placed in charge of fire prevention. His/her responsibilities will include assurance of availability, opera-
tion, and location of fire protection equipment, general supervision of safeguards and location of sala-
manders; or portable heating equipment and establishment, and maintenance of safe cutting and welding
operations.

A6.3. Contractor's material and equipment will not be stored in a location or manner that will create a fire
exposure to facilities, adjacent to the project site. Fire hydrants will not be fenced in on construction sites.

A6.4. Fire Reporting. All fires, regardless of size, will be reported to the Base Fire Department immedi-
ately by the most expeditious means. Any persons who discover fire, or suspect a fire, will alert the build-
ing occupants by whatever means that are available. The Fire Department will be notified in the following
manner: Dial 911 if callers are from MacDill Air Force Base. The 911 number is to be used only for
reporting an actual fire or other serious emergency conditions. A reporting of false alarm fire is a mali-
cious act and transmitting such false alarms will be subject to disciplinary action.
