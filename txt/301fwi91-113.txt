This instruction establishes procedures for the handling and inspection of blank ammunition and
expended munitions items and reusable containers that are handled by 301st Fighter Wing
personnel participating in exercises. This Instruction applies to all personnel assigned to the
wing that are required to use blank ammunition.

1. Purpose: The purpose of this Instruction is to establish and standardize procedures and
responsibilities for 301st Fighter Wing personnel, concerning the inspection, issue, loading and
turn-in of blank munitions used during field exercises.
2. General Instructions: When munitions operations are not covered in sufficient detail by
other applicable publications such as Technical Orders (T.O.s), local instructions are required.
Compliance with the cardinal principle rule for munitions safety is mandatory: “Expose the
minimum number of people to the minimum amount of explosives for the minimum amount of
time.” The designation of Commander applies to the squadron Commander utilizing the
munitions. The designation of Munitions Custodian applies to the squadron utilizing the
munitions.
3. Objective: The provisions of this instruction apply whenever blank munitions are present
during an exercise or training mission. It is the responsibility of each Squadron Commander or
member designated by the Wing Commander (301FW/CC) to ensure the separation of training
and weapons courier ammunition and that live munitions are not introduced into a field training
exercise.
4. Requirements:
 2                                                               301FWI91-113 20 JUNE 2011


     4.1. M-9s will be used as guard weapons. Members armed with the M-9 and performing
     official duties will not be permitted into the training exercise area unless “real world”
     security is required in the training area.
     4.2. Individuals carrying the weapon(s) loaded with live ammo are also required to wear an
     orange reflective vest. Only those individuals qualified to carry the M-9 pistol will perform
     “Overwatch” (Guard Duty) for protection of resources used in field exercises. Guard M-9
     magazines must indicate they are loaded with “Live” ammo by painting the bottom foot plate
     “Red”.
     4.3. All units will designate an overall Exercise Supervisor, in the grade of E-5 or above,
     who is in charge of all Observers/Controllers. The Exercise Supervisor will ensure that
     personnel are briefed on their responsibilities regarding accountability from a safety
     standpoint. The Exercise Supervisor is responsible for briefing the Misfire Procedures, in
     accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 36-2227V1, Combat Arms Training
     Programs Individual Use Weapons, 36-2227V2, Combat Arms Training Programs Crew
     Served Weapons. Each Exercise Supervisor and Observer/Controller will be responsible for
     conducting inspections of weapons and ammunition to maintain 100 percent accountability
     of all expended and unexpended ammunitions, as well as the separation of training and
     weapons courier ammunition.
     4.4. All magazines used for training and exercises with blank munitions will be identified by
     color-coding the bottom one-third of the magazine with a light to medium shade of BLUE
     tape. These are the only authorized weapons magazines to be used in exercise and training
     areas. Absolutely no other magazine/ammunition will be introduced into the exercise area.
     4.5. Live ammo will be identified by color-coding the bottom one-third of the M-16/M-4
     magazine with RED tape to identify the magazine and the M16/M-4 as containing “Live
     Rounds.”
5. Inspection/Loading:
     5.1. Combat Arms or a member designated by the Commander who is a qualified AFSC

     rucksacks, mobility bags, gear and magazines for live ammunitions.
     5.2. Combat Arms Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (301 SFS/SFTC) or a member
     designated by the Commander will visually inspect all blank munitions utilized by the 301st
     Security Forces Squadron (301 SFS) prior to use in any/all field exercises to ensure that no
     live ammunition is present.
     5.3. Combat Arms or a member designated by the Commander will supervise the loading of
     all magazines with blank munitions in a controlled environment under the observation of a
     disinterested third party familiar with blank and live ammunitions.
     5.4. Combat Arms or a member designated by the Commander will ensure that all
     magazines containing blank munitions are identified by color coding the bottom one-third of
     the magazine with a light to medium shade of Blue tape, sealed with masking tape and
     marked with the initials of the member responsible for loading
     5.5. Combat Arms or a member designated by the Commander will ensure that all
     magazines containing blank munitions are stored in an approved metal container during
301FWI91-113 20 JUNE 2011                                                                    3


   exercises. The container will be sealed and “Blank Ammo” will be written in large legible
   words on the outside of the container.
   5.6. Combat Arms or a member designated by the Commander will ensure that live or blank
   ammo will not be issued to other than security forces personnel without the supervision of a
   Combat Arms Instructor or Munitions Custodian.

   conducted to the maximum extent possible to collect expended blank ammunition. AF Form
   2005, Issue/Turn-In Request will be filled out for the number of rounds expended; munitions
   remaining will then be returned to the supply point.

INSTRUCTIONS
SECTION 1: Identify the Hazards: Visualize the expected flow of
  301FWI91-113 20 JUNE 2011                                                   9


events and identify any conditions that might result in personnel injury or
death, property damage, or degraded mission performance. If some prior
planning has been done, focus on changes in the operation from the
original plan to help identify hazards.            Figure A3.1.
Identify the potential sources of danger
which cause risk. Examples include:
poor weather, deviations from a plan, or
lack of adequate rehearsal.
SECTION II: Assess the Risks:
Determine which of the identified hazards
present the greatest risk, considering the
potential outcomes and their probability
and severity.
Review hazards identified in step 1 and describe the overall impact using
qualitative (numerical probability) analysis.
Determine the level of risk associated with each hazard.
Prioritize the hazards for action.
SECTION III: Analyze Risk Control Measures: Determine what
controls can be implemented to counter the assessed risks.
Avoid risk - Can high-risk elements be eliminated without compromising
objectives?
Reduce risk - Can the mission be modified or changed to reduce the risk,
perhaps by increased training or procedures?
Spread the risk - Example: increase exposure distance or limit exposure
time.
Transfer the risk - Kill it with technology. Send the mission to a unit
better suited to handle the task. Use a machine versus a person.
SECTION IV: Make Control Decisions: Determine which courses of
action will best accomplish the mission with an acceptable level of risk.
Allocate the resources to the prioritized list of risks. Resources include:
time, money and manpower.
Resources should be allocated to improve the balance between benefit and
risk. Avoid excessive resources to completely eliminate risks when a
simple reduction is sufficient.
Make decisions at the lowest possible level. Elevate to a higher level
when necessary.
Consider the following tools to aid the decision-making process:
Regulations and specific decision-level guidance.
   10                                                               301FWI91-113 20 JUNE 2011


Decision logic table.
Joint planning publications.
Risk management guidelines.
Lessons learned from previous operations.
SECTION V: Risk Control Implementation: Implement the controls
and the courses of action decided on in the previous step.
Controls may be substantial such as writing an instruction or as simple as
conducting a safety briefing.
Implement control measures in an organizational context. Get input from
the field, make sure people will understand the control measures.
Generate command commitment before implementation. Look for ways
to demonstrate that commitment.
Launch the option, provide visual aids, include in job guides. Be clear on
who has responsibility for implementation at unit level.
SECTION VI: Supervise and Review: Monitor the operation for
effectiveness of the controls and changes. Correct ineffective controls and
begin the ORM process again as further changes occur.
Actions go beyond making sure people do what is expected of them.
Actions include follow-up to evaluate and adjust risk management
decisions and controls
