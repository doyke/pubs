                                            Chapter 1

                         LONG-HAUL COMMUNICATIONS (LHC)

1.1. Overview. The Air Force Information Networks (AFIN) (formerly the Air Force-Global
Information Grid [AF-GIG]) is the Air Force unique information capabilities in the DoD
Information Networks (DODIN) for which the Air Force has primary responsibility for the
procurement, operations, and defense. JP 3-12, Cyberspace Operations, renames the Global
Information Grid (GIG) to DODIN and these terms may appear interchangeably in this
publication as GIG is still in use in Joint Publication (JP) 6-0, Joint Communications System, as
well as DISA LHC publications and processes. As defined in JP 6-0, the DODIN (formerly the
GIG) is not limited to Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) and SECRET
Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). As such the AFIN includes all DODIN
infrastructure and services for which the Air Force has responsibility. In Accordance With
(IAW) AFPD 33-1, Cyberspace Support, the Air Force centrally manages and provisions this
AFIN infrastructure.
     1.1.1. The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) LHC is an integral part of the
     DODIN, providing global infrastructure and services including voice, data, video switching
     and transmission services entering or leaving the confines of a Post, Camp, Station, Base,
     Installation Headquarters, or Federal building and associated network management, including
     regional services, Metropolitan Area Networks and edge devices. In accordance with
     Department of Defense (DoD) policy, Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is
     responsible for obtaining and managing DISN services, facilities, and equipment and “…is
     the preferred Unified Capabilities (UC) transport provider for Internet and commercial
     satellite connections used for voice, video, and/or data services on DoD networks”. The
     DISN is a significant component of the AFIN. It has three segments: sustaining base, long
     haul, and deployed. As the Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI) for Cyberspace
     Superiority and Lead Command for Cyberspace, Headquarters, Air Force Space Command
     (AFSPC) is responsible for administering, maintaining and sustaining the associated AFIN
     infrastructure and services, to include the Air Force provisioned portions of the DISN.
     1.1.2. The Air Force, through AFSPC, centrally provisions, manages and funds the Air Force
     enterprise portion of the AFIN DISN infrastructure and services supporting Air Force
     installations.   MAJCOMs, as Management Headquarters, are responsible for their
     MAJCOM-unique, base-level, and non-DODIN infrastructure, systems and services. All Air
     Force organizations including MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs obtain LHC through DISA
     according to this AFMAN, DoD, CJCS instructions, DISA Circulars, DISN Notices, and
     DISN Connection Process Guide.
     1.1.3. The DISN Subscription Service (DSS) is the Defense Working Capital Fund cost
     recovery mechanism for the DISN LHC. In 2004, Program Budget Decision (PBD) 723
     established the DSS which changed the DISN billing structure from one based on individual
     connection/service costs to a fixed-fee structure where costs are set based on a finite number
     of service packages comprised of DISN services and bandwidth consumed at each DISN host
     site. AFSPC, as the Lead Command for Cyberspace, ensures centralized planning,
     programming, budgeting, and execution for the Air Force’s DSS costs for all DSS locations
AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013                                                                           5


   where the Air Force has been assigned by Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD)
   Comptroller as the site host.
   1.1.4. In accordance with DoD policy, DISA is responsible for obtaining and managing LHC
   services, facilities, and equipment for the DoD. DoDI 8100.04, DoD Unified Capabilities
   (UC), states, “the DISA is the preferred UC transport provider for Internet and commercial
   satellite connections used for voice, video, and/or data services on DoD networks”.
   Exemptions and waiver authority to this policy are detailed in DoDI 8100.04. AFSPC is the
   Air Force DISN LHC Lead Command, and 38 CYRS/SCC executes AFSPC’s DISN LHC
   Lead Command responsibilities.
1.2. DISN Organizations. There are multiple organizations responsible for developing and
delivering DODIN services and DISN infrastructure. JP 6-0, CJCSI 6211.02, Defense
Information Systems Network (DISN) Responsibilities, and DoD Directive 5105.19 define the
organizations primarily responsible for planning, acquiring and sustaining cyberspace
capabilities to include United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), United States
Cyberspace Command (USCYBERCOM), the DISA and the service components and agencies.
   1.2.1. USSTRATCOM. Conducts global operations in coordination with other Combatant
   Commands, Services, and appropriate U.S. Government agencies (CC/S/A) to deter and
   detect strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies, and is prepared to defend the nation as
   directed.      The USSTRATCOM Commander (CDRUSSTRATCOM) has overall
   responsibility for global network operations and defense in coordination with the Chairman
   of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and the other combatant commands.
   CDRUSSTRATCOM directs DoD information networks operations and defense of DoD
   information network including the DISN, synchronizes cyberspace operations planning, and
   delineates USCYBERCOM roles and responsibilities to plan, coordinate, and direct DISN
   network operations and defense.
   1.2.2. USCYBERCOM. Plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, and conducts
   activities to: direct operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information
   networks, prepare, and when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations
   in order to enable actions in all domains. Ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace
   and deny the same to our adversaries. USCYBERCOM has operational and tactical level
   planning and day-to-day management of the operations and defense of the DODIN.
   1.2.3. DISA. Provides, operates, and assures command and control, information sharing
   capabilities, and a globally accessible enterprise information infrastructure in direct support
   to joint warfighters, National level leaders, and other mission and coalition partners across
   the full spectrum of operations. DISA is responsible for planning, engineering, acquiring,
   testing, fielding, and supporting global net-centric information and communications solutions
   to serve the needs of the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, and the DoD
   Components, under all conditions of peace and war, including national security
   communications requirements as identified in the National Security Presidential Directive –
   28 (Reference (c)) and Executive Order 12472 (as amended) (Reference (d)). DISA plans,
   programs, implements, and operates long-haul DISN services supporting the DODIN for
   Services and Agencies, extending to the Service Delivery Point (SDP) at a
   base/post/camp/station. (DISAC 310-70-1)
 6                                                               AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013


     1.2.4. Service Components and Agencies (S/A). Provide communications capabilities to
     meet combatant command-validated connectivity requirements, including combatant
     command connectivity through DISN collection and distribution sites for both deployed and
     garrison local infrastructures. All activities in support of the provided capabilities are
     managed, funded, and supported by the hosting service component. S/A responsibilities
     include support (e.g., power, security, space, manpower, etc.)
1.3. DSS. PBD 723, dated 10 Dec 2004, changed DISA’s DISN billing structure from one
based on each connection and service provided, to a flat-fee based on a combination of the total
services and bandwidth assignment at DISN host sites. The combination of the bandwidth and
services are defined as the location’s DSS Package.
     1.3.1. DSS package assignments are reviewed during the Program Object Memorandum
     (POM) cycle and are established two years in advance of the fiscal year in which they are
     billed. A concerted effort is made to ensure all future requirements that may bring changes
     in a location’s bandwidth requirement or the services delivered are captured and documented
     in the annual DSS data call conducted first quarter of each Fiscal Year (FY). Submission of
     DSS changes will be made at the MAJCOM and/or Agency Vice-Commander level.
        1.3.1.1. The DISN Customer Forum (DCF) meets regularly to identify emerging
        program requirements of all the Services and Hosts that might affect DSS package
        assignment. The DCF makes change recommendations to Office of the Secretary of
        Defense (OSD) who has ultimate authority over DSS.
        1.3.1.2. Requirements that have a DISN service and/or bandwidth component must be
        identified in the Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System (CIPS). CIPS is the Air
        Force enterprise-wide communications and information equipment, systems and
        infrastructure planning tool. CIPS includes downward directed enterprise solutions, as
        well as MAJCOM, base and in-theatre planning. Quantified, validated and prioritized
        requirements must be identified as early as possible to ensure the required equipment,
        infrastructure and funding are available to support the requirements. Attachments 2 and 3
        provide specific guidance on how to document and process LHC requirements.
     1.3.2. DISN services between any two DSS sites are centrally funded, and the cost is based
     on package and size assignment. DSS size assignments are categorized as Small, Medium,
     Large and Mega. DSS package assignments are categorized as (1) Transport/Intelligence,
     Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Only, (2) Mission Essential, (3) Command and
     Control (C2), (4) C2 Plus, and, (5) C2 ISR. DSS Package size and assignment descriptions
     are in tables 1.0 and 1.1.

                                        PROCEDURES

4.1. Ordering Communications Service.
   4.1.1. In accordance with attachment 2, approved CIPS LHC requirements are forwarded to
   the ARO. The ARO submits a TR in DDOE according to DISAC 310-130-1 and DISA
   Provisioning Notices.
   4.1.2. The responsible CMO validates the requirement, conducts a technical review, ensures
   accuracy, and validates completeness of the TR in DDOE. CMOs will track and manage the
   requirement from submission to completion.
   4.1.3. AFO approves the funds, reviews the PDC, Cost Threshold Not To Exceed (NTE),
   Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC), and Non-Recurring Charge (NRC). AFO will select the
   Bona Fide Need Fiscal Year statement. All PDCs must have a LOA in TIBI.
   4.1.4. The approved TR is released as a TSR and routes to the responsible DISA or DITCO
   office for further action.
   4.1.5. The DISA provisioning office creates the TSO. The TSO provides the authorization
   to allocate resources to fulfill the requirement and assigns a lifetime circuit identifier known
   as the Command Communications Service Designator (CCSD). If DISA cannot fulfill the
   requirement, DDOE routes the order directly to DITCO for leasing action.
   4.1.6. DITCO creates and issues a SAM (if applicable), DITCO Europe issues both a circuit
   demand and SAM. The SAM and circuit demand messages advise the customer of the
   acquisition status and assigns the CSA.
   4.1.7. The organization assigned as CCO in the TSO accepts the service on behalf of the
   government and will submit the appropriate completion report if required according to
   DISAC 310-70-1 and DISAC 310-130-1. TCOSS provides an automated completion report
   writer to assist compilation of the report.
   4.1.8. Joint Hawaii Information Transfer System (JHITS) is used for leased commercial
   services in the state of Hawaii, defined to be the eight primary islands. JHITS provides
   enhanced information transfer capabilities to DoD and certain other authorized users in the
   State of Hawaii. The JHITS provides a full range of GIG compliant end-to-end switched
   voice, video, data and DISN transmission services for both the backbone as well as for the
   infrastructure of the base, post, camp and station.
   4.1.9. The DISA and commercial vendors operate on a meet-me basis with the customer
   responsible for procuring and maintaining connectivity from their equipment to the
   commercial or DISN POP. Local service agreements dictate how to obtain connectivity
   along with associated costs. When the local communications unit cannot install a service,
   customers may obtain service installation support using the DISA Site Support contracts.
   These contracts extend service over existing infrastructure. Installation of base or site fiber
   or copper between buildings is outside of the contract scope.

AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013                                                                        25


4.7. Networx Contract for Commercial Long Distance Services.
   4.7.1. The Air Force uses the GSA Networx contract world-wide for dedicated and switched
   long-distance telephone and toll free service, calling cards, dial-up video conference service,
   audio conferencing service, and internet protocol service. The Air Force also uses Networx
   to support other requirements according to DoD policy when a DISN solution is not
   available.
      4.7.1.1. Per DOD CIO Memorandum, Base and Long-Haul Telecommunications
      Equipment and Services-Policy Clarification Memorandum, 10 May 2007, all
      commercial long distance service must be ordered through DISA.
      4.7.1.2. Under the terms of the Networx contract, a registered Agency Hierarchy Code
      (AHC) must be included on each Networx order. The AHC is used to ensure accurate
      billing by the Networx vendor and by the Air Force DAR Administrator for the Networx
      contract to grant entitlements to the Networx vendors’ on-line systems where usage,
      billing, trouble ticket and order status information is available.
      4.7.1.3. Requirements for commercial Internet Protocol Service (IPS) cannot be
      submitted without an OSD waiver IAW DODI 8100.04, and AFI 33-129, Web
      Management and Internet Use.
      4.7.1.4. Dedicated point-to-point circuits may also be provisioned from the Networx
      contract if DISA determines Networx is most advantageous to the government. Orders
      for Dedicated Point-to-Point service are entered in DDOE through the “Dedicated”
      module, not the “Networx” module.
      4.7.1.5. Requirement owners should ensure Networx orders for dedicated long distance
      service are accompanied by a parallel order for Switched long distance with the same
      number range(s) as the Dedicated order to avoid Casual Billing issues resulting from PIC
      overflow. In addition, each number within the range should be individually billed for
      long distance usage versus “bill-to-number” for the range to increase accountability and
      billing accuracy.
   4.7.2. Process Networx requirements according to DISAC 310-130-1 and DISA
   Provisioning Notices. Only DITCO is authorized to place orders for DoD against the
   Networx contract. Do not directly contact Networx vendors to place orders. For additional
   information on the Networx contract see the Networx Contract page on the Air Force Long-
   Haul Communications Community of Practice (LHC CoP) SharePoint site or contact the Air
   Force     DAR       Administrator     for     the    Networx      Contract     at     the
   38CYRS.SCC.networx@us.af.mil.
4.8. DISN Subscription Services (DSS).
   4.8.1. MAJCOMs will not use DISN subscription PDCs when ordering circuits or services.
   4.8.2. MAJCOMs will use local funded and/or MAJCOM dedicated PDCs when ordering
   circuits or services between DSS locations to reflect ownership.
   4.8.3. 26 NOS managed NIPRNET and SIPRNET circuits between DSS locations will use
   standard common user PDCs.

   See AFI 33-590 for INMARSAT equipment management accountability procedures.
4.11. Enhanced Mobile Satellite Service (EMSS) (Iridium).
   4.11.1. The EMSS is a satellite-based, global wireless personnel communications network
   designed to permit any type of narrow-band wireless transmission, (i.e., voice, data, fax,
   short burst messaging, or paging) to reach its destination with a minimum reliance on land-
   based infrastructures. Cross-linking between satellites and up and down-linking through the
   DoD terrestrial satellite gateway in Wahiawa HI, allows DoD users Network and DSN secure
   global access and coverage through specially designed portable and mobile telephones
   known as Iridium Subscriber Units. The EMSS systems support DoD missions and
   operations as well as other federal and NS/EP communications. The DoD - EMSS systems
   complement military terrestrial and satellite communications (SATCOM) and improve
   warfighter beyond line-of-sight connectivity by offering near-worldwide to global access to
AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013                                                                        27


   all echelons of the DoD. For more information about EMSS, DoD, and Air Force policy can
   be        found        at      the       MSS         Community        of       Practice

   4.11.2. Hardware and services must be procured through DISA/DITCO contracts. See AFI
   33-134 for exceptions to this policy.
   4.11.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will establish procedures to ensure the requested
   service meets mission requirements and is cost effective and ensures procedures are
   established to verify EMSS billing.
   4.11.4. Air Force users requiring EMSS follow the provisioning process already in place for
   ordering LHC as directed in DISAC 310-130-1 and this instruction. Questions on
   MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU EMSS process be addressed by the command’s MSS Manager.
      4.11.4.1. Iridium equipment will be properly accounted for in Asset Inventory
      Management using the MSS tab of the Personnel Wireless Communications System
      module. AIM is the system of record for tracking and inventory of Iridium equipment.
      See AFI 33-590 for Iridium equipment management accountability procedures.
4.12. DISA Control Numbers (DCN) for Military Exercise.
   4.12.1. DISA uses DCN as unclassified project control numbers to manage joint and military
   exercise requirements. Obtain DCN early for use and release to all exercise participants
   submitting requirements.
   4.12.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs submit requests for DCN to the appropriate DISA
   provisioning activity. The DCN request must include the exercise name, the inclusive dates
   of the exercise, and identify the request as JCS or Air Force-directed. Send a separate
   classified message to the DISA provisioning activity if using classified information.
   4.12.3. Submit DCN requests to:
      4.12.3.1. DISN Service Center (DSC), 604 Tyler St, Scott AFB IL 62225-5421, if a
      Continental United States (CONUS)-based activity sponsors the exercise. All CONUS-
      based Combatant Commands (CCMD) will go through DISA CONUS for DCN.
      4.12.3.2. DISA Europe, Unit 30403 Box 357, APO AE 09131-4103, if a European-based
      activity sponsors the exercise.

      Pacific-based activity sponsors the exercise.
4.13. TSP Restoration and Provisioning/National Security Emergency Preparedness
(NS/EP).
   4.13.1. The Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) Program provides national security
   and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) users with priority restoration and provisioning of
   telecommunications services that are vital to coordinating and responding to crises. The TSP
   Program has two components, restoration and provisioning. A restoration priority is applied
   to new or existing telecommunications services to ensure restoration before services with
   lower or no priority. Priority restoration is necessary for a TSP service because interruptions
   may have a serious, adverse effect on the supported NS/EP function.
 28                                                               AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013


   4.13.2. Obtaining restoration TSP.
       4.13.2.1. For new and existing circuits that are ordered through DISA; complete the TSP
       section of the TR in DDOE. DISA routes TSP request to the Department of Homeland
       Security for processing and TSP assignment. See DISAC 310-130-4 for TSP criteria and
       DISAC 310-130-1 for DDOE procedures.
       4.13.2.2. For new starts and re-awards processed directly through DITCO, the customer
       must:
           4.13.2.2.1. Complete the DDOE TR and obtain a CSA from DITCO.
           4.13.2.2.2. After receiving the CSA identifier, the customer will complete a TSP
           request. TSP is requested by submitting the SF 315 TSP Request for Service Users to
           the TSP Program Office (TSPPO) or by completing the automated version of the
           form at http://www.dhs.gov/publication/tsp-documents.
           4.13.2.2.3. Once the TSP is received, the customer will amend the DDOE TR to
           include the TSP and associated funding.
       4.13.2.3. Requesting a TSP for an existing circuit that was ordered initially without a
       TSP and was processed through DITCO:
           4.13.2.3.1. The customer will complete a TSP request. TSP is requested by
           submitting the SF 315 to the TSPPO or by completing the automated version of the
           form at http://www.dhs.gov/publication/tsp-documents.
           4.13.2.3.2. Once the TSP is received, the customer will submit a change DDOE TR
           to include the TSP and associated funding.
   4.13.3. Obtaining provisioning TSP (NS/EP)
       4.13.3.1. A key feature of the TSP Program is that service users can obtain provisioning
       priority from service vendors for the installation of new NS/EP services. A provisioning
       priority authorizes the service vendor to take steps to provide the service earlier than the
       service vendor's normal business procedures would allow. Customers invoking NS/EP
       are liable for all installation fees regardless of the cost. NS/EP requirements fall into two
       categories emergency and essential.
Note: NS/EP is not applicable to foreign Telecommunications Carriers within Europe. Air
Force MAJCOMs requiring Emergency or Essential, INTRA EUR circuits, need to know that
exceptional provisioning is the process used for circuits solely within EUR. To obtain
exceptional provisioning expedited assistance in the European Theater, contact the United States
Air Force Europe (USAFE) CMO office, commercial, 618-229-9933, DSN 312-779-9933 or
9934, Email: CMO.USAFE@US.AF.MIL.
   4.13.4. Invoking NS/EP.
       4.13.4.1. The requesting organization must justify and validate the need to invoke
       NS/EP. The two types of NS/EP are emergency and essential. Emergency NS/EP
       requirements are for critical service needed at the earliest possible time, regardless of
       costs associated with obtaining the service. DISAC 310-130-1 contains a detailed
       description of emergency service. Essential NS/EP requirements are for critical service
       requested by a specified date, regardless of costs associated with overtime or expediting
AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013                                                                          29


       the service and the date is not achievable without invoking NS/EP. DISAC 310-130-1
       contains a detailed description of essential service.
Note: NS/EP is NOT invoked to:
   Compensate for time lost as a result of inadequate advance planning.
   Activate service(s) for which required customer premise equipment (e.g., government
      furnished modems, encryption equipment, or other terminal equipment), customer premise
      wiring, or network facilities will not be available by the service user's requested date.
   Facilitate the normal relocation or rearrangement of existing service(s) (e.g., internal
      organizational moves) unless required to support the start of a new NS/EP
      telecommunications service.
   Disconnect existing service(s) unless required to support the start of a new NS/EP
      telecommunications service.
   Obtain the U.S. half circuit segment(s) or the U.S. tail (extension) segment(s) of an
      international telecommunications service(s) for which the foreign half-circuit segment(s)
      or the foreign tail (extension) segment(s) will not be available at the service user's service
      due date.
       4.13.4.2. The requesting organization must contact their AF-Level FOA/DRU or
       MAJCOM A6 office to coordinate the NS/EP request with the invoking official.
       4.13.4.3. The requesting organization submits a DDOE TR and completes the
       provisioning TSP section. DISA routes TSP request to the Department of Homeland
       Security for processing and TSP assignment. See DISAC 310-130-4 for TSP criteria and
       DISAC 310-130-1 for DDOE procedures.
4.14. Accepting LHC Service.
   4.14.1. The CCO identified in the TSO is responsible for the initial activation of circuits and
   trunks, and to accept leased services on behalf of the U.S. Government and submitting the
   appropriate completion report. The report will submitted within 72 hours (based on 24-hour
   workday, not including weekends and holidays) of the service date as documented on the
   TSR or TSO, and IAW DISAC 310-130-1 and DISAC 310-70-1. The CCO will:
       4.14.1.1. Accept service by submitting a completion report. There are four types of
       completion reports: DSR, EXC, Ready for Use (RFU), and IER. The CCO,
       Communications Management Office, or agency designated in the TSR or TSO is
       responsible to submit these reports.
       4.14.1.2. Submit completion reports via email for every DDOE order, unless otherwise
       specified in the TSR or TSO. Submit copies of the completion reports to the originator of
       the DDOE order and all addressees on the TSR or TSO. In the case of a DDOE order for
       leased equipment or service not requiring a TSO, submit a completion report as specified
       in the TSR. TCOSS has an automated completion report writer to assist in developing all
       of these reports.
   4.14.2. The CCO or Communications Management Office coordinates with the commercial
   vendor at least five working days before the scheduled service date.
   4.14.3. If the commercial vendor cannot or does not meet the scheduled service date, the
   designated CCO will:
30                                                             AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013


     4.14.3.1. Issue a DSR due to vendor difficulties. A delayed service report will be
     telephoned to DITCO and the requestor by the facility or activity designated in the TSO
     to report on the circuit. The requestor will telephonically advise DITCO or the
     appropriate DITCO field activity. The verbal report will be confirmed by a formatted
     DSR to the requestor and to the originator and all addressees of the TSO within 72 hours.
     4.14.3.2. Submit a DSR according to DISAC 310-70-1 when the established service date
     cannot be met due to governmental causes. This report will be sent to the requestor, the
     originator, and all addressees of the TSO. It will be sent as soon as the inability to meet
     the required service date becomes known. When possible, this message report will be
     preceded by a verbal notification to the requestor. If the forecasted delay, as reported in
     item 8 of the delayed service report, is excessive (e.g., unknown), a report will be
     submitted each 30 days until a firm date is established. The problem may be resolved by
     exceptional procedures as outlined in subparagraph 2.4.2 of Chapter 2 of DISAC 310-
     130-1 (reference 4.6).
     4.14.3.3. Advise the requestor who will issue an amended TR reflecting the new or
     revised required service date.
     4.14.3.4. Submit an amended DDOE order adjusting service date to coincide with
     government's readiness to accept the service.
     4.14.3.5. Contact, notify and confirm with appropriate DISA provisioning activity of the
     delay if there is not enough time to submit an amended DDOE order.
     4.14.3.6. Validate notification with amended DDOE order within 10 duty days.
     4.14.3.7. Contact appropriate DISA provisioning activity for instructions if government
     is responsible for delaying the service 30 days beyond initial scheduled service date.
     4.14.3.8. Accept the service and submit an EXC if the service deviates from the
     specifications of the DDOE order, TSR or TSO, or the technical parameters of the
     applicable schedules. Prior to accepting service, advise the TSO issuing authority of
     those technical parameters failing to meet established standards, who will in turn advise
     the facility or activity if service is to be accepted with these exceptions. An EXC report
     will be submitted every 30 days until exception has been cleared.
     4.14.3.9. Submit an IER within 72 hours of the service's installation. This final report
     indicates the installed service meets all details of the DDOE order, TSR, TSO and
     technical parameters of the specified technical schedule. Clear all DSR and EXC with an
     IER after resolving all delays or exceptions.
     4.14.3.10. Use DD Form 1368, Modified Use of Leased Communications Facilities, to
     inform DISA/DITCO of interruptions to leased services. Unscheduled Commercial
     carrier outages must be reported by the facility designated in the TSO for reimbursement
     of service not provided. Reporting interruptions to leased services has two purposes:
        4.14.3.10.1. To allow monetary reimbursement for unusable service that exceeds 2
        hours.
        4.14.3.10.2. To document vendor substandard performance.
AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013                                                                          31

      responsibility.
      4.15.3.2. Certify all circuits and services in the R&R database for their areas of
      responsibility. They will certify each circuit and service with one of the three allowable
      R&R database statuses (Meets mission needs, Can be reconfigured or downgraded, or
      may be discontinued). All circuits and services that no longer satisfy a mission need will
      be terminated or discontinued. For circuits and services that can be migrated to a more
      cost effective service, change or amend actions will be processed via a TR in the DDOE
      system.
   4.15.4. Customers (end users, funding authority) shall coordinate with their servicing TCF or
   Circuit Actions office for any required changes in status or required termination of circuits
   and services they use.

   LONG-HAUL COMMUNICATIONS (LHC) REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT
                          PROCESS

A2.1. Background.
   A2.1.1. LHC provides mission-essential interbase bandwidth and communications services
   for the Air Force and DoD via the DISN. These services and associated bandwidth are
   funded via the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). The DSS is the cost recovery
   mechanism for the DWCF with a tiered, share-based cost structure based on the location,
   services and bandwidth required. Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) establishes the
   share costs for the DoD Components and Agencies 2 years in advance of the year of
   execution. The Air Force portion of the DSS bill is funded corporately.
   A2.1.2. The Air Force’s mission is one that is heavily reliant on information technology and
   the associated LHC that permits world-wide operations, particularly from home. While IT
   and our LHC have enabled the Air Force to be more effective, efficient and has driven
   operations costs down, there has been a corresponding increase in our LHC costs which, until
   recently, has not received any attention. Our LHC costs, as a corporate bill, have been
   permitted to grow unconstrained; the result of the way the Air Force fights. However, recent
   fiscal realities have highlighted the fact that our resources are not limitless. This includes our
   LHC resources, which are neither limitless, nor free.
   A2.1.3. Under the OSD DSS construct, the Air Force’s LHC bill is a must pay bill which we
   have little ability to reduce once the bandwidth and services have been established. At
   $550M+ in FY14, the Air Force must exercise better control over its demand and more
   diligently scrutinize requirements before the Air Force is obligated to future increases in
   these costs. All LHC requirements that may impact the Air Force corporate bill must be
   submitted and approved through the requirements management process outlined below. The
   Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System (CIPS) will be used to identify, validate, route
   and approve all Air Force LHC requests prior to submission to DISA/DITCO via the DDOE
   system. Requests that have a DSS or LHC requirement must be identified as early as
   possible to ensure the required equipment, infrastructure and funding are available to support
   the requests. No Air Force DDOE requests will be processed without an approved LHC
   requirement that has been vetted via this process.
A2.2. Purpose.
   A2.2.1. This process provides a means to review, validate, approve, or disapprove DISN
   LHC requirements that may impact the DSS and LHC funding.
   A2.2.2. This process only applies to Air Force requirements or those requirements for which
   the Air Force is the owner or generator. The Air Force is not permitted to restrict or bill Joint
   tenants. Once this process matures, the process may be evolved to include those tenants who
   also drive the Air Force corporate bill.
A2.3. LHC Requirements Process. The Air Force Long Haul Requirements management
process consists of 8 phases and is detailed below.
 42                                                        AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013


Figure A2.1. LHC Requirements Process Flowchart.




A2.4. LHC Requirements Process.
   A2.4.1. Customer. The customer is the originator of the LHC requirement. The customer
   may reside at any Air Force organizational level from base to Air Force. Work with the
AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013                                                                     43


  appropriate planning organization to identify bandwidth and LHC service needs. The
  customer in developing the LHC requirement is responsible for ensuring that all requirements
  are well justified and include sufficient documentation to include bandwidth analysis to
  support the request. The customer is also responsible for ensuring funding is available for
  installation and sustainment of leased services. In the last phase of the requirements
  management process, the customer will work with the local TCF, PTF, or circuit actions
  office to ensure the approved requirement is submitted into the DDOE system so that
  DISA/DITCO can provision the requested service.
  A2.4.2. Base. The base communications squadron assists customers in the documentation of
  LHC requirements via CIPS and exercises base-level review and approval responsibilities as
  defined in this document. The communications squadron is also responsible for reviewing,
  validating and approving requirements at the base level before the requirement continues
  coordination in CIPS. The base communications squadron is also responsible for submitting
  requirements approved through the requirements management process defined in this
  document into DDOE at the end of the requirements management process.
  A2.4.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs. Reviews, validates and approves all requirements
  submitted from the base as prescribed in this document. As part of this phase, the
  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will ensure funding is available for initiatives and ensures
  only validated and justified requests for service are approved and forwarded for higher level
  consideration. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will ensure that requirements make the most
  efficient use of available network resources, bandwidth efficiency technologies and where
  required, take action to reduce demand.
  A2.4.4. AFISRA (JWICS Only). The AFISRA is the Air Force lead for all JWICS
  requirements. AFISRA will review, validate, and approve all JWICS requirements before
  forwarding the requirement for review and coordination.
  A2.4.5. AFSN will review NIPRNET, SIPRNET new starts and bandwidth increase
  requirements for completeness and coordinate a bandwidth assessment with the 26th NOS.
  AFSN will verify whether hardware assets will need to be upgraded to support new
  requirements or an increase in bandwidth for existing NIPRNET and SIPRNET circuits.
  Additionally, AFSN is the acquisition arm for procuring hardware assets.
  A2.4.6. 26 NOS monitors and analyzes NIPRNET and SIPRNET utilization and makes
  bandwidth change recommendations based on mission requirements and usage. The 26 NOS
  will follow the same process as a customer when recommending bandwidth changes to the
  Air Force’s NIPRNET and SIPRNET circuits. 26 NOS will also review and coordinate on
  all common user funded Air Force requirements involving NIPRNET and SIPRNET
  services.
  A2.4.7. 38 CYRS/SCC (LHC Provisioning). 38 CYRS/SCC has provisioning responsibility
  for all DISN services for the Air Force, to include financial management; DSS impact
  assessments, circuit management, and DDOE order processing. 38 CYRS/SCC’s key role is
  in assessing the financial impact to the Air Force’s LHC bill and providing recommendations
  to the Long Haul Communications Management Board (LMB). As the Requirements Lead
  for LHC, 38 CYRS/SCC will serve as the Executive Secretariat to the LMB. The LMB
  Executive Secretariat schedules and facilitates the CCB meeting, publishes minutes and
  returns the final LMB package to the Capability Lead or service requestor for action.
 44                                                            AFMAN33-116 16 MAY 2013

chairperson.
   A2.8.1. LMB Meetings: The LMB shall be held as required to accommodate the LHC
   change request activity.
   A2.8.2. Attendance: Core members or designee attendance is mandatory.
   A2.8.3. Meeting Notice and Agenda: Project manager provides a copy of their final briefing
   and presentation to the LMB Executive Secretariat, no later than seven (7) working days
   prior to the LMB. A meeting notice, including an agenda, is provided to each LMB member
   at least three (3) working days prior to each scheduled meeting. Each member reviews the
   agenda and determines their organization’s position on each proposed item.
   A2.8.4. Special Provisions.
       A2.8.4.1. All Air Force organizations invoking NS/EP will coordinate the NS/EP with
       the LMB for situational awareness, mission impact, and funding impact the NS/EP may
       have on the Air Force LHC bill. NS/EP orders will be processed according to DISA
       Circular 310-130-1, 310-130-4, NCSSD 3-1, and NCSM 3-1-1. Documenting in CIPS
       will be completed as soon as possible after the NS/EP is approved. However, DDOE
       processing will not be delayed for completion of the CIPS requirements process.
Note: See Chapter 4 of this AFMAN for NS/EP process. Lack of LMB coordination on NS/EP
will not impede provisioning of NS/EP requirements.
       A2.8.4.2. DSS package threshold. All requests for locations where allocated bandwidth
       has exceeded the thresholds in Attachment 3, Table 5, will require LMB approval,
       regardless of the approval level identified in Attachment 3, Tables 1 - 4.

                             LMB STANDARD WORK GUIDE

A3.1. Introduction.
   A3.1.1. The Standard Work Guide (SWG) details the process for managing all DISN LHC
   requirements. It ensures the preparation, evaluation, coordination and management of LHC
   requirements and proposed changes. The requirements management process seeks to ensure
   changes are cost effective, timely, and required.
   A3.1.2. This SWG drives standardization of the LHC requirements management process
   across the Air Force. In addition it ensures implementation of repeatable processes, enables
   cradle-to-grave tracking of the change request, and provides compliance with Air Force
   strategic goals and objectives.
A3.2. LHC Requirements Process.
   A3.2.1. Decision criteria for topics that need to go before the LMB:
       A3.2.1.1. All LHC service requirements will be approved at the appropriate level as
       outlined in, Attachment 3 Tables 1 - 4, Request Approval Levels, and Table 5, Bandwidth
       Approval Thresholds. Approval or disapproval at each level will be documented within
       the CIPS tool, include the authorizing officials name, phone number, email address, and
       rational for the action.
       A3.2.1.2. All requirements that will break a DSS subscription or bring total package size
       within the thresholds identified in Table 5 will require LMB approval.
Tables 1-4 identify the LHC Request approval levels. The tables prescribe the approval
levels for specific LHC services. In all cases, if any requirement will result in a change to
the DSS subscription for a location that increases the cost to the Air Force corporate bill,
that request must be approved by AFSPC.
