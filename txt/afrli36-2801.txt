SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Three AFRL
awards instructions: AFRLI 36-1004, AFRL-Wide Civilian Quarterly Awards, AFRLI 36-2804,
AFRL Annual Awards Program, and AFRLI 36-2843, Science and Technology Awards Program,
have been superseded and combined into one instruction. The new lab demo expansion pay plan
was added and needed administrative changes were made.

Overview. The AFRL-Wide Civilian Quarterly Awards, AFRL Annual Awards, and the S&T
Awards program are administered by the Personnel Director (AFRL/DP). To preserve the
integrity of the program, awards will only be given to individuals or teams for acts that are
clearly and distinctively outstanding and that directly support the goals and missions of AFRL,
Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and the United States Air Force (USAF).

               AFRL-WIDE CIVILIAN QUARTERLY AWARDS PROGRAM

1.1. General.

     the AFRL-Wide Civilian Quarterly Awards Program.
     1.1.2. Eligibility. All AFRL civilian employees are eligible for these awards. Military,
     contractors, intergovernmental personnel, and individuals assigned outside AFRL are not

     1.1.3. Award Period. The period of this award is from 1 January to 31 March, 1 April to 30

     directorate (TD) and 711th Human Performance Wing (711 HPW) Awards Monitors to be

     notified of the winners via e-mail and asked to disseminate the information throughout their
     organization.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. AFRL Awards Program Manager (AFRL/DPMD). AFRL/DPMD is the focal point
     for the awards program and notifies all AFRL organizations (through their workflow
     accounts and awards monitors) of nomination deadlines. The awards manager reviews

     awards manager is the board secretary responsible for recording decisions that are made and
     implementing them when appropriate.
     1.2.2. AFRL Supervisors. AFRL supervisors will prepare nomination packages for the
     categories in which they wish to compete. Nominations will be forwarded to the designated
     award monitor for the TD/711 HPW.

     workflow accounts requesting each organization designate one representative to serve on the
     awards board for one year (1 Apr to 31 Mar). The board will consist of representatives from
     each of the 10 TD/711 HPW and headquarters (HQ) (for a total of 11 voting members, at the
     rank of lieutenant colonel, GS-14, DR-III or DO-III, and above) and will be rotated annually.
     AFRL/DPMD will provide board members with nomination packages and ranking sheets.
     Each voting member will review and rank all nominations received where more than one
     nominee is submitted. Each nominee will be assigned a score with “1” being the highest
     ranking. The individual with the lowest point total will be selected as the award category
     winner. In the event of a tie, the nominee with the most number of “1” ratings would be
     determined the winner. In the event of another tie, the awards board will vote again only on
     those nominees that are still tied. Selections will be forwarded to the command section for
     final approval.

3.1. General.

   significant accomplishments in S&T in support of the Air Force Mission.
   3.1.2. Eligibility. Refer to AFI 36-2843, paragraph 3 for specific award eligibility.
   3.1.3. Description of Awards. Refer to AFI 36-2843, paragraph 2 for specific award
   descriptions.
3.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   3.2.1. Awards Program Manager (AFRL/DPMD). AFRL/DPMD is the focal point for the
   awards program and notifies the AFRL TD/711 HPW Chief Scientist and all AFRL
   organizations (through their workflow accounts and awards monitors) of nomination
   deadlines, with a courtesy copy to AFRL Chief Technologist (AFRL/CZ). The awards
   manager reviews nominations for regulatory compliance and prepares packages for the
   awards board. The awards manager is the board secretary responsible for recording decisions
   that are made and implementing them when appropriate.
   3.2.2. AFRL TD/711 HPW Chief Scientists. The AFRL TD/711 HPW Chief Scientist will
   review and approve all nomination packages to ensure they meet the intent of the award.
   Nominations will be forwarded to each TD/711 HPW designated awards monitor.
   3.2.3. Awards Board. Once a year, AFRL/DPMD will send a call out to all TD/711 HPW
   workflow accounts requesting each organization designate one representative to serve on the
   awards board for one year (1 Apr to 31 Mar). The board will consist of representatives from
   each of the AFRL HQ and 10 TD/711 HPW (for a total of 11 voting members, at the rank of
   lieutenant colonel, GS-14, DR-III or DO-III, and above) and will be rotated annually. The
   awards manager will provide board members with nomination packages and ranking sheets.
   Each voting member will review and rank all nominations received where more than one
   nominee is submitted. Each nominee will be assigned a score with “1” being the highest
   ranking. The individual with the lowest point total will be selected as the award category
   winner. In the event of a tie, the nominee with the most number of “1” ratings would be
   determined the winner. In the event of another tie, the awards board will vote again only on
   those nominees that are still tied. Selections will be forwarded to AFRL/CZ for final
   approval.
   3.2.4. AFRL Chief Technologist (AFRL/CZ). AFRL/CZ will approve the selections.
   3.2.5. AFRL TD/711 HPW Awards Monitor. The AFRL HQ and TD/711 HPW Awards
   Monitors are the focal point within the TD/711 HPW who notifies all management levels of
   nomination deadlines and provides guidelines for submittal of nominations. The TD/711
   HPW awards monitor reviews nominations for regulatory compliance and posts the
   nominations to AFRL awards webpage(s) as instructed by AFRL/DPMD.
