WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI91-101 30 JANUARY 2009                                                        3


     5.1.13. Place misfired/unserviceable blank cartridges in a metal ammo can marked
     ―Unserviceable Cartridges‖ and segregate from serviceable and expended items.
     5.1.14. Make arrangements to turn-in unserviceable cartridges to the Munitions Storage
     Area (MSA) Inspection Section for inspection and disposition.
  5.2. The 88th Security Forces Squadron Commander or their designee will:
     5.2.1. Establish a training and certification program for exercise and training supervisors.
     5.2.2. Appoint, in writing, 88 SFS personnel exercise supervisors, ammunition
     custodians (if applicable), and personnel armed with live ammunition (88 SFS personnel
     including augmentees).
  5.3. The squadron commander or two-letter equivalent, or their designee, of the organization
  requesting use of blanks will:
     5.3.1. Appoint in writing the exercise supervisor and ammunition custodian.
  5.4. The exercise supervisor will ensure all exercise participants are either qualified on or
  have received safe weapons handling training on the weapon they will be carrying during the
  exercise. This training will either be conducted on-site and logged on the training sign-in
  roster, be documented in their mobility folder, or documented on AF Form 1098, Special
  Task Certification and Recurring Training.
  5.5. An officer or noncommissioned officer must:
     5.5.1. Inspect all exercise participants to ensure they are not carrying live ammunition.
     5.5.2. Inspect ammunition and magazines to ensure only blank ammunition is employed.
     This should include a joint inspection with the armorer when ammunition is picked up or
     turned in.
     5.5.3. Ensure all exercise participants are aware of the physical differences between live
     and blank ammunition and can readily identify both (Attachment 2).
     5.5.4. Brief all exercise participants that weapons loaded with blanks and equipped with
     blank firing attachments or adapters, are not to be pointed and fired at any individual
     within 20 feet of the muzzle unless technical data dictates a greater distance (Attachment
     2).
     5.5.5. Ensure armed guard and weapon are readily identifiable as having live
     ammunition. It is highly recommended that any personnel armed for weapons security
     duties be armed with a weapon which fires a different type and caliber of ammunition
     than the type of blank ammunition being utilized within the training environment. This is
     recommended to further reduce the possibility of live ammunition being mixed with
     training munitions. If this recommendation cannot be followed, local rules outlined must
     be strictly enforced (Attachment 2).
     5.5.6. Handguns must be carried in an authorized holster or approved container.
     5.5.7. Ensure personnel with live ammunition wear reflective vests, and their magazines
     are marked with red tape. Personnel armed with live ammunition will be issued their
     weapons and ammunition at a location other than the exercise training area (Bldg 168, 88

       SFS Building), and will at no time remove live ammunition from the weapon in the
       training area.
       5.5.8. Instructor and supervisory personnel will maintain radio contact with exercise
       control center, range control, or the exercise controllers during all exercises. The
       Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) will monitor exercise radio net.

     live ammunition, ensure blank firing adapters are affixed to weapons, and provide a pre-
     task safety briefing prior to blank ammunition operations (Attachment 2). Aggressor
     forces will use the same procedures for attaining blank ammunition from wing readiness
     in the WTC as any other participant. Once the exercise has ENDEX, aggressor forces
     will: clear weapons at a clearing barrel IAW AFMAN 31-229 prior to leaving the

     6.4.4. At the time of issue, trainees will proceed one-by-one to the instructor, and a
     disinterested person in the grade of E-5 or above, at which time those three personnel will
     open the sealed packages of blank ammunition to be used by the trainee and verify no
     live ammunition is present. At this time the trainee’s magazine(s) will be examined by
     the instructor to ensure it is empty and the BFA is properly affixed to the weapon.
     6.4.5. Once trainee has been issued blank ammunition by the instructor, he/she will be
