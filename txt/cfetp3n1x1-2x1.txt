Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements and training
support resources for AFSC 3N1X1, 3N2X1 and 3N1X1Z. In addition, it identifies 3-skill level
training requirements for the award of AFSC 3N1X1, 3N2X1 and 3N1X1Z, minimum core task
requirements for AFSC 3N1X1 and 3N1X1Z and authority for the award of the AFSC 3N2X1 7-
skill level. The CFETP provides personnel a clear career path to success and instills rigor in all
aspects of career field training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors use both parts of the plan, manage, and control
training within the career field.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression
information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C
associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other);
Section D indicates resource constraints; Section E identifies 3N1XX specialty shredouts.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS)
and identifies duties, tasks, and technical references to support training, standardized audition
requirements, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training (3-skill level)
and core tasks. Section B identifies optional support materials.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan will enable us to
train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part
II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose of the CFETP. This CFETP provides information that the Air Force Career Field
Functional Manager (AFCFM), career field managers, commanders, training specialists,
supervisors and trainers need to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field
training program. It outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to
develop and progress throughout their career life-cycle. It identifies initial skill requirements (a
standardized audition process for entry into the career field and 3-skill level attainment
requirements while assigned to the Air Force basic military training environment), and delineates
follow-on upgrade, qualification, and proficiency training. Upgrade training includes all
mandatory qualification requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. Qualification
training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to prepare an airman for a specific
duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It
is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Proficiency
training is additional training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge
beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP also serves the following purposes:

1.1. As a management tool to plan, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program, and to
assist supervisors in identifying training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty.

1.3. Lists mandatory and optional training material available in the specialty.

1.4. Identifies resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field
training process.

2. Uses of the CFETP. The plan will be used by supervisors at all levels to ensure that
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. Career field managers and training specialists will work with the AFCFM to develop
acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide identified training, and will
conduct an annual review of the CFETP to ensure currency and accuracy.

2.2. Career field managers, commanders, training specialists, supervisors and trainers will
ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and
proficiency requirements.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in Part II,
Section A of this CFETP.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the coordination and approval authority for this
CFETP.

mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and
conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will
ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.

5.1. Apprentice (3-skill level) Training. Initial skills training in this specialty includes the
standardized audition process and completion of BMTS Drum and Bugle Corps training program
while assigned to the Air Force basic military training environment. Certification of AFSC
3N1X1 and AFSC 3N2X1 3-skill level (Apprentice) is documented in Part II of this CFETP in
the Specialty Training Standard (STS). Note: ANG band members accomplish additional
follow-on training after BMTS (see Part II, Section A - Specialty Training Standard, paragraph
1.3)

5.2. Journeyman (5-skill level) Training. AFSC 3N1X1 job qualification training consists of
knowledge and task requirements identified in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and its
attachments at Part II, Section A of this CFETP. Journeyman training knowledge and task
requirements satisfy the training needs of personnel in grades E-1 – E-4. The decision to train
specific Journeyman (5-skill level) knowledge and task items is based on a review of
Occupational Survey Report (OSR) data, Training Requirement Analysis (TRA), and 3N1X1
subject matter experts (SME) inputs.

5.2.1. The standardized audition process and confirmation of 3-skill level (Apprentice)
certification is documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) for 3N1X1, 3N2X1 and
3N1X1Z personnel. The remainder of Part II of this CFETP is not maintained for 3N2X1
personnel.

5.2.1.1. AFSC 3N2X1 personnel assigned to The USAF Band, Bolling AFB, DC, are promoted

                                               11
6. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum (life-cycle) of training requirements for this specialty. The
spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The
strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a
disjointed approach to training.

6.1. Initial Skills Training. Initial skills training will include both the standardized audition
process and completion of the BMTS Drum and Bugle Corps training program. Note: ANG
band members accomplish additional follow-on training after BMTS (see Part II, Section A -
Specialty Training Standard, paragraph 1.3).

6.2. Advanced Skills Training (5- and 7-skill level). Advanced skills training is enhanced to
provide education and training expertise necessary to progress smoothly through the Journeyman
and Craftsman levels.

6.2.1. OJT is provided in non-musical disciplines, such as band operations, public
affairs/publicity, library, supply, information management, and computer (maintenance, upgrade,
and repair) skills. Personnel in training to the 5-skill level must be certified in at least one non-
musical discipline. Personnel in training to the 7-skill level must complete a minimum of one
additional non-musical discipline so that upon completion of training to the 7-skill level,
bandsmen will have received training in a minimum of two non-musical duty areas.

6.2.2. AFSC 3N1X1 personnel will attend a minimum of two sanctioned symposiums or
workshops related to their shredout, performance environment, or duty position, as an incentive
to invigorate individuals to develop, broaden, and crystallize career goals. AFSC 3N1X1
personnel may complete this requirement anytime in their career, however, members must
complete this requirement prior to award of the 7-skill level.

7. Continuation Training. 9-skill level and other personnel serving in specialized duty
positions will be given Continuation Training (CT) to enhance otherwise limited management
and/or leadership experience. CT requires no formal training documentation.

8. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon
completion of basic military training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associates in
Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its associates degree program, CCAF offers the
following:

8.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor qualification
training, consisting of the instructor methods course and supervised practice teaching, CCAF
instructors who possess an associates degree or higher may be nominated by their school
commander/commandant for certification as an occupational instructor. Consult the current
CCAF catalog for requirements.

8.2. Associate in Applied Science Degree Requirements. The journeyman (five) level must be
held at the time of program completion. A sample of the Music degree program in the 2002-
2004 CCAF General Catalog is as follows:

Part II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This Specialty Training Standard (STS) will be used by 3NXX1 personnel
to document certification and award of the Apprentice (3-skill level) through the standardized
audition process and completion of the Basic Military Training School (BMTS) Drum and Bugle
Corps training program.

1.1 Regional Bands (AFSC 3N1X1). This STS will be used by 3N1X1 personnel to document
certification and award of the Journeyman (5-skill level) and the Craftsman (7-skill level).
Manager/Superintendent Continuation Training (CT) does not require formal documentation.
For standardized audition and documentation procedures refer to Part II, Section A, paragraph
2.7.2.

1.2 Premier Bands (AFSC 3N2X1). The standardized audition and training requirements
designed to assure maintenance of performance and readiness standards of The USAF Band and
The USAF Band of the Rockies (AFSC 3N2X1) are developed and maintained separately by the
respective premier band commanders.

1.3. Air National Guard Bands (AFSC 3N1X1Z). ANG Band members achieve the
Apprentice (3-skill level) through the standardized audition process, completion of the Basic
Military Training School (BMTS) Drum and Bugle Corps training program, and follow-on
training. Follow-on training consists of musical training accomplished by using one of two
training options selected by the band commander at the time of enlistment. Both options utilize
the Band Journeyman (5-skill level) tasks in the CFETP. ANG Band commanders may
substitute repertoire of similar difficulty for the standardized audition process and follow-on
training. For standardized audition and documentation procedures refer to Part II, Section A,
paragraph 2.7.2.

1.3.1. Option #1 - Training with an active duty USAF band. This training option consists of
up to 120 days of training with a USAF band. The ANG band commander determines the exact
length of training. ANG band commanders coordinate and obtain approval from the USAF band
located in their geographic Area of Responsibility (AOR) prior to the individual attending basic
training. The individual reports to the USAF band directly from BMTS and is trained by
members of that band.

1.3.2. Option #2 - College Enrollment. This training option consists of training at a regionally
accredited college or university for one academic term (approx. 120 days). Some colleges use a
semester system, while others use a quarter system. Both are acceptable for ANG training. The
ANG band commander ensures that the appropriate courses have been selected and that the
individual is working on the areas contained in the Band Journeyman (5-skill level) section of
the CFETP.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:




                                               21
2.1. Identifies the specific trainee to whom this copy of the CFETP applies, and provides for
name(s) and initial(s) of the trainee, trainers and certifying official(s).

2.2. Includes a Proficiency Code Key that defines task, knowledge, and subject performance
levels, and can be used as a guide for interpreting actual performance depth required of the
trainee during Apprentice (3-skill level), Journeyman (5-skill level), and Craftsman (7-skill
level) training.

2.3. Lists in Column 1 the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR)
necessary for airmen to perform duties at the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-skill level AFSC in the 3N1XX
Career Field. These are based on an analysis of the duties in the Specialty Description. Task
statements are numbered sequentially i.e., 1.1., 1.2., 2.1., 2.2., etc.

2.4. Lists in Column 2 the skill level at which specialty-wide core task training requirements are
accomplished.

2.5. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and
knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document
technician qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification/completed
date. At a minimum, use the following column designator: (Training Complete, Certifier
Initials). On-the-job training certification should be oriented towards certifying individuals on
the items identified as core tasks. Being certified on a core task in this section requires the trainee
to be certified in any tasks and subtasks from the other sections that may apply. When the trainee
has been certified on all tasks related to a core task and demonstrates the ability to bring all
elements together for an acceptable product, the trainee may be signed off on the core task.

2.6. Shows formal training proficiency requirements. Column 4 shows the level of competency
(Proficiency Code) to be demonstrated by the candidate as a result of training on the task and/or
knowledge requirement. (Apprentice [3-skill level] proficiency codes are prescribed by the
standardized audition process and completion of the BMTS Drum and Bugle Corps training
program.)

2.7. Becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in an AF
Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. When used as a
JQS, the following requirements apply:

2.7.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training. Identify duty position
requirements by circling the subparagraph number next to the task statement. As a minimum,
complete the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP: Training Completed, Trainee Initials,
Trainer Initials and Certifier Initials (if applicable). An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of
the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM. NOTE: The AFCFM may supplement these
minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their career field.

2.7.1.1. Converting from Old CFETP. Use the new CFETP to identify and certify all past and
current qualifications. For those tasks previously certified and required in the current duty
position, evaluate current qualifications and, when verified, recertify using current date as



                                                  22
completion date and enter certifier’s initials. For previous certification on tasks not required in
the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion dates. If and when these
tasks become a duty position requirement, recertify with current date and certifier’s initials.

2.7.1.1.1. For core and critical tasks previously certified and required in the current duty
position, evaluate current qualifications and when verified, recertify using current date as
completion date, and enter trainee’s and certifier’s initials.

2.7.1.1.2. For non-core and non-critical tasks previously certified and required in the current
duty position, evaluate current qualifications and when verified, recertify using current date, as
completion date and enter trainee’s and trainer’s initials.

2.7.1.1.3. When transcribing previous certification for tasks not required in the current duty
position, carry forward only the previous completion date of certification (not the initials of
another person). If and when transcribed tasks become duty position requirements, recertify
using standard certification procedures.

2.7.1.1.4. The person whose initials appear in the trainer or certifier block during the
transcription process must meet the requirements of their respective roles.

2.7.1.1.5. Upon completion of the transcription process, give the old CFETP to the member.

2.7.1.2. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be unqualified on a
task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous
certification or deletes previous certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks
are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the
reason for decertification. The individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old
entries and writing in the new or by using water based correction fluid (if the entries were made
in ink) over the previously certified entry.

2.7.2. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of procedures.

2.7.2.1. Standardized Audition Process. IAW AFI36-2002 entry into the Air Force band career
field is initiated by a standardized audition. As such, the training life-cycle begins with the
standardized audition. Standardized auditions will be documented by shredout using musical
tasks for 3-level certification specified in the Specialty Training Standard pages 27-70 (for
example, a 3N1X1A audition is accomplished by completing the proficiency requirements on
pages 27-28, column 4A). Document standardized audition and completion of BMTS in the STS
to certify technical school equivalency. If applicant will be assigned to a different base forward
STS to gaining unit. IAW AFI36-2002, band officials document successful auditions on an AF
Form 485.

2.7.2.1.1. A Band Commander may waive a required proficiency code if an auditionee
demonstrates sufficient ability and potential to accomplish upgrade training in requisite time.



                                                 23
Band officials document the waiver on an AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record
Continuation Sheet.

2.7.2.2. A BMTS Instructor certifies completion of the Drum and Bugle Corps program upon
successful completion of Basic Military Training.

2.7.2.3. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be unqualified on a
task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous
certification or deletes previous certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks
are entered on an AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the
reason for decertification. The individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old
entries and writing in the new or by using water based correction fluid (if the entries were made
in ink) over the previously certified entry.

2.7.2.4. Downgrading and Withdrawing AFSC Procedures. Downgrade and withdrawal of
AFSC is done IAW AFI36-2101 Chapter 4.

3. Responsibilities. The supervisor, trainer, and trainee are each responsible for the accuracy of
this document. The following requirements also apply:

3.1. In order to fulfill both musical and administrative requirements prescribed in the STS,
trainees in both 5- and 7-skill level training will normally perform administrative tasks as well as
upgrade training. However, trainees may be temporarily removed from their primary
administrative duty assignments and reassigned to selected training positions to fulfill all training
requirements (When certification of all Core Tasks is complete, trainees are reassigned to
administrative duty positions). Circle the appropriate item in Column 1 to identify the current,
training duty position.

3.2. Trainees are trained, evaluated, and certified on the tasks (both musical and non-musical)
listed in Column 1. The fully certified trainee can perform the task without assistance and meet
local demands for accuracy and timeliness. Skill level certification is accomplished only by
band officers.

3.3. All Core Tasks listed in Part II of the STS are required for certification. This STS is
assembled so that the Core Tasks list contains both musical training required of a specific
shredout (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, or V) and administrative training
required of all trainees. The following requirements apply individual trainee STSs:

3.3.1. Each required Core Task is documented by annotating the start date and the completion
date. In addition, each required Core Task is documented by annotating the initials of the
Trainee, Trainer, and Certifying Official.

3.3.2. Supervisors schedule OJT according to work center operational requirements, trainer and
task certifier availability, logic and training opportunities. Notionally, the Trainee should receive
one lesson each week. If musical performance lessons are not practical during TDY status,
accomplish administrative performance requirements as appropriate. Each lesson is documented



                                                 24
on the AF Form 3029, Lesson Assignment and Evaluation, and filed in the member’s AF Form
623, Training Record.

3.3.3. Certifying Officials are authorized to require trainees to perform only the performance
tasks described in Column 2 of the STS, Part II. Trainees are expected to use supplemental texts,
methods, and materials provided in Section B of the STS, Part II, or texts, methods, and
materials prescribed by private instructors and approved by certifying officials, to supplement
training throughout the formal training cycle. IAW AFI 35-101, paragraph 10.22.5, bands are
authorized to pay for the cost of private training from civilian teachers and institutions for band
members.

3.4. Personnel in formal training to the 5-skill level must complete training in a minimum of one
administrative duty position. Personnel in formal training to the 7-skill level must complete
training in a minimum of one administrative duty positions not previously certified. Upon the
completion of formalized 7-skill level training, an individual will have received training and
been certified in a minimum of two administrative duty positions.

3.5. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance or progression of individual trainees
on AF Form 623. Report inadequacies of and suggest corrections to this STS through channels
to AFCFM. Reference specific paragraphs.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or
for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.
