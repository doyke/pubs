This instruction defines responsibilities and provides procedures for entering labor production transac-
tions in the Time and Attendance (TAA) portion of the Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production
System. The goal for data entry is accurate and properly formatted data through extensive on-line valida-
tion at the field element level such as Employee or Shop Number, Job Order Number, Work Order and
Operation Number, Environmental Hazard Codes, proper leave and overtime authorizations, etc.

                                           APPLICABILITY

The DMAPS Time and Attendance System (DMAPS-TAA) is an information system that processes
Labor and Attendance. The development and evolution of TAA has been predicated on the idea of having
a standard means of entering labor transactions with a minimal effort from the affected employee. The
goal for production labor data entry is accurate and properly formatted data through extensive on-line val-
idation at the field element level such as Employee or RCC, Job Order Number (JON), Work Order and
Operation Number, Environmental Hazard Codes, proper leave and overtime authorizations, etc. This is
accomplished through the use of extensive validation files and tables. DMAPS TAA is an application of
hours available: (1) direct hours worked by cost center on each job order. (2) indirect hours worked by
cost center; and (3) nonproductive (annual, sick, etc.) hours by cost center. The TAA system is being
implemented in two phases, over several months, at each Air Logistics Center (ALC). Until Phase 2 is
fully implemented, users will apply applicable portions of the user manual (e.g., section 2 of this AFMCI)
based on DMAPS training provided at each site.

1.1. Phase I. The first phase involves deployment of the TAA component of the DMAPS suite to allow
users to become familiar with TAA and its capability before we leave current legacy systems and rely
strictly on TAA for time and attendance. During this phase, current legacy system for labor distribution
will continue to operate (i.e., G037G). Current legacy systems will continue to provide financial informa-
tion and payroll to labor reconciliation data.
    1.1.1. Data needed to initialize TAA tables with Employee Master Record information will be pro-
    vided by MSG Programmer/OC-ALCupon request from the ALC Site OPR. NAVAIR will then load
    the information (referred to as a “Slice” file) into TAA for the selected employees for that pay period
    implementation. See Tour of Duty Initialization Procedures for specifics.
    1.1.2. To load TAA tables and for Phase I production, utilize the current Master Employee Record
    (MER) files that DCPS sends to the IBM platform after each pay period processes. The weekly file
    includes such employee data as pay plans, status of certain ‘type hour codes’; the biweekly file pro-
    vides leave balances. The leave balances provided by the MER during Phase I Production will be very
    important. TAA does not restrict transactions for leave if the employee does not have enough leave.
    1.1.3. New Employees. TAA should be entered first, as the employee ID number is generated IAW
    procedures established in “Tour of Duty Initiation Procedures”.
    1.1.4. To load RCCs into TAA, the RCC Master Structure file from G037G will be used to provide
    valid RCCs for implementation. During Phase I production, the TAA OPR will add/delete any RCCs
    using the ‘Shop Table Maintenance’. RCCs must be in both TASYS and TAA.
    1.1.5. When TAA is implemented, Traumatic Injury numbers must be entered into the Traumatic
    Injury Table using the instructions below. Once TAA is in use, traumatic injury numbers will be estab-
    lished by TAA using the LU and LT type leave transactions (see paragraph 5.12. below and Part
    Two, Users Manual, section 5.3.1.).

1.2. Phase 2. The second phase involves full implementation of the DMAPS suite where TAA continues
to be the sole input mechanism for labor and the Defense Industrial Financial Management System
(DIFMS) will be the source for financial information, including reconciliation with DCPS.

1.3. Time and Attendance Standards. Management will assure the following standards are achieved
through implementation of DMAPS-TAA.
   1.3.1. Collect data on employees who work temporarily in other or multiple pay classifications.
   1.3.2. Collect actual hours or days worked, and other pay related data, e.g., piecework, fee basis units/
   dollars, and differentials for each employee.
   1.3.3. Determine premium pay entitlements based on schedule tour, actual hours worked and leave
   data.
   1.3.4. Receive electronic or other appropriately documented approvals from authorized approving
   officials, and then release data for further system processing.
   1.3.5. Capture data in hours, fractions of hours, or other units of measure as required.
   1.3.6. Support the correction of current- and prior-pay period time and attendance records.
   1.3.7. Accept time and attendance data through various processing modes e.g., automated time entry
   (such as bar code) or internet.
   1.3.8. Calculate and adjust weekly, biweekly, prior pay period hours based on Fair Labor Standards
   Act (FLSA), Title 5, and other statutory and regulatory requirements.
   1.3.9. Collect time and attendance data on a pay period basis, as a minimum daily, weekly, and
   biweekly.
   1.3.10. Collect work and leave hours based upon an established tour of duty, including alternative
   work schedule/flextime hours information. This requires pre-approved or positive acknowledgment
   from the approving official that the employee worked the established tour and that time and atten-
   dance data is approved.
   1.3.11. Use reports generated by DMAPS TAA to monitor T&A data.
   1.3.12. Collect labor distribution hours based on the required classification code structure to include
   Customer Order Number (CON), Job Order Number (JON), and task.
   1.3.13. Approvals shall be made individually for each employee, and a handwritten or an automated
   signature shall be provided for each time and attendance report.
   1.3.14. For approval, supervisors use system data contained in a computer file and displayed on a ter-
   minal. Supervisors enter a single automated code to approve the information contained in the file.
   1.3.15. Protect data from unauthorized changes to completed time and attendance reports, regardless
   of where they are retained.
   1.3.16. Review and correct T&A data at the earliest time to ensure that the data are complete, accu-
   rate, and in accordance with legal requirements.
   1.3.17. Record and report the number of hours of leave (by type), credit hours, and compensating time
   used.

                                   TAA SYSTEM MANAGEMENT

The TAA system requires a management role at each operating location for user access, system adminis-
tration, and contingency operations. TAA functional OPR should be assigned for the site and/or PD. Func-
tional OPR must be able to write and execute queries to research problems. For some individuals,
obtaining this capability will require training.

2.1. System User Access.
    2.1.1. Use DISA Form 41 for obtaining authority to access the TAA system. Initiate the Form 41 in
    the user’s work area. Send the Form 41 through the supervisor to the TAA functional OPR to get user
    identification established. TAA functional OPR will maintain copy. User will then process the form 41
    for TAA and other systems as required through the appropriate OPRs and DISA.
    2.1.2. Assign transaction code access per request on DISA Form 41. Cannot assign until employee
    has logged onto TAA and set their password. Assign DLCP Access. Change transaction code access
    upon request. For access problems, the user calls the site OPR. An example of an access problem is a
    user not being able to transact because the person is in TAA as GS and should be WG. The system
    OPR also resets passwords, as needed.
    2.1.3. Once the new employee has been entered into the Employee Master Record in TAA, they will
    have default capability in TAA. Should an employee need more access than default capability to per-
    form their duties, the new user must log into TAA and update the system default password. After that
    logon has been performed, the TAA OPR can then assign other access. System access problems
    should be directed to the TAA OPR.
    2.1.4. The TAA logon window provides user access to the system based on entry of the employee
    identification number and password. Sites assign the employee identification number using the
    Employee Identification Generator (EIG), a part of the AFIE. Use the TAA user manual (Part Two,
    User Manual, sections 4.0 and 5.3.9.4.) for password conventions.

2.2. System Administration.
    2.2.1. Provide customer support. Answer user questions. For example, notify users concerning “In
    Lieu of” holiday transactions. Provide system access and DLCP messages to notify users instantly.
    2.2.2. Employee Identification. Until the below steps are done, employees cannot wand labor. A new
    employee check in packet can take care of a lot of these issues. (i.e., DISA Form 41 for PDMSS, TAA,
    badge forms, etc.). For Phase I, ID’s and badges will be issued during training. Sites should implement
    an on-going procedure for ID’s and badges.
       2.2.2.1. Create Employee ID using the EIG module of the AFIE. This ID will be used throughout
       TAA instead of the employee’s SSAN. Before creating the ID, employees must have an approved
       DISA Form 41 granting access. The EIG enables an operator to enter the name, SSN, and organi-
       zation for new employees and will assign a unique employee number. The ID will be created by
       the TAA OPR using the Employee ID Generator (EIG) application which will randomly produce
       a 6 digit alphanumeric ID (first position alpha, followed by 5 numbers). The name, SSN, organi-
       zation and employee ID will be stored in a database table. The operator can view the list of all
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                                7


       assigned employee numbers and can specify a subset for printing or saving to a file. The operator
       will be able to mark an Employee ID as no longer used which will result in it being removed from
       the system and thus available for reuse.
       2.2.2.2. Create an employee badge, using equipment purchased for DMAPS. All employees in
       TAA will be supplied with an employee badge that will contain their EMPLOYEE ID in bar coded
       format. Employee badges will also have a message on back with instructions on how to return a
       lost badge.
       2.2.2.3. For PDMSS users, employee will not be input to TAA until notification is received from
       PDMSS that user has been established in PDMSS. This notification needs to occur early on the
       employee's first day.
   2.2.3. Table Maintenance Transactions. Responsible for Agency Tour of Duty Table. Responsible for
   creating/deleting/changing Pattern Table. Maintain RCC Table. Establish Holiday/Mass Leave Table.
       2.2.3.1. Agency Tour of Duty Table sets the earliest and latest time that labor can be performed.
       2.2.3.2. Pattern Table sets a 14-day pay period schedule with shift times, lunch times, including
       work and non-workdays to make employee schedule changes easier. For temporary changes use
       the current schedule. For permanent changes, use the future schedule.
       2.2.3.3. Holiday/Mass Leave Table establishes scheduled holidays and mass leave as needed.
       ‘In-lieu of Holiday’ transactions will be made by Supervisors/Timekeepers (see paragraph 5.7.).
       2.2.3.4. RCC Table links an RCC with a schedule (shift start, shift duration, lunch start, lunch
       duration). If the RCC does not reside in the TA_DIFMS_SHOP_TBL in TAA, then the OPR will
       not be able to establish an RCC and shift. The TA_DIFMS_SHOP_TBL is updated with an inter-
       face from DIFMS, which is the system of record for establishing RCCs.
   2.2.4. RCCs and skill codes will be linked using the RSC (RCC/Skill Code Application) which
   resides as part of the AFIE. This item is not a part of TAA and is included here only for informational
   purposes.
   2.2.5. Determine processing dates. Ensure batch reports needed for research and documentation are
   retained. For batch reporting, review ZH104R01 (PEF Update Actions) each day, ZH145R01 (Daily
   Labor Report) and ZH104D03 Suspended Transaction File. This last file allows viewing of future
   transactions or transactions suspended due to time processing. These are all processed using the NT
   Batch Server. The site OPR puts batch audit on CD each pay period and performs needed research.
   2.2.6. Record Retention. As long as the labor charges by employee are archived and can be easily
   accessed, an electronic version is acceptable for record retention.
   2.2.7. Perform periodic audit checks to see how corrections are being input through the DLCP. OPR
   will store the Facility Wide Pay Period Audit Report as an audit trail.

2.3. Contingency Procedures. Establish a site contingency operation when the system, or segments of
the system, are temporarily not operating. Refer to the user manual (User Manual, section 5.6) for system
procedures and site contingency operations for site-specific requirements.

                                                Chapter 3

                                        SYSTEM PROCESSING

3.1. Reports. Report printing, use, distribution and so forth is a local responsibility. The Daily Labor
Report and Facility Wide Pay period Audit Report (User Manual, section 5.3) are potentially several thou-
sand pages and should not be printed; instead store information on compact disk for research. Use on-line
capability as much as possible instead of printing reports or other information.

3.2. Records. As long as the labor charges by employee are archived and can be easily accessed, an elec-
tronic version is acceptable for record retention. Once DMAPS is fully implemented, records will be
retained through the DMAPS data store.

3.3. Labor Review and Correction.
    3.3.1. Daily labor batch processing calculates, accumulates and reports labor for each of the DMAG
    employees at the Air Logistics Center (ALC). Batch processing provides for the accumulation of each
    employee’s labor at the daily level for the entire pay period and reports to responsible supervisors any
    condition causing an employee’s reported labor to be out of balance with his scheduled Tour of Duty.
    TAA is the collection system that provides data to the financial module of DMAPS referred to as
    DIFMS (Defense Industrial Financial Management System).
       3.3.1.1. DIFMS, implemented as part of DMAPS Phase 2, provides the following capabilities.
       Computes and extends labor for civilian/military employees. Establishes acceleration rates and
       computes accelerated labor. Applies predetermined overhead rates and computes overhead costs.
       Reconciles civilian labor to payroll. Updates shop cost data, calculates stabilized costs, and issues
       labor cost data. Adjusts leave and fringe benefits to general ledger at the end of the fiscal year.
       Provides reports for labor controls, unallocated, leave, labor distribution and Civilian Personnel
       Resource Reporting System.
    3.3.2. Access to the Daily Labor Correction Process (DLCP) and related screens is for supervisors
    only, following the approach outlined in paragraph 2. Supervisors will be granted access to only those
    aspects of DLCP required to research and correct errors. System administration should handle update
    to user access, audit trail and TOD processes.
    3.3.3. Supervisors and/or timekeepers change work schedules, workdays, and other employee sched-
    ule transactions. Many of these transactions are based on the personnel action (e.g., SF50).
    3.3.4. Daily, supervisors review TAA status for assigned employees. Note that some payroll-related
    information, such as pay rate, may be one pay period in arrears based on when the updates from DCPS
    are processed.
    3.3.5. Site OPR checks DLCP to see who might be entering their own records and does the DLCP
    on-line audit. Within the DLCP are screens that allow the site OPR to review as an audit trail of who
    made changes to what employee. Facility Wide Pay period DLCP Audit Report is another avenue for
    auditing. This report tracks all changes made to employees time & attendance via the DLCP. This
    shows who made the correction, what was made and when correction was made. This report MUST be
    written to CD.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                               9


3.4. Employee Master Maintenance. Each site decides to give the access for adding, changing, and
deleting employees from the Employee Master. This also involves the access for the workday change
transaction where employees are set to 'pending separation' or deleted employees are reactivated. See
User Manual section 5.3.7.1.
   3.4.1. Site OPR Access. The Site OPR handles changes to tables, such as permanent shop (or RCC),
   through the Employee Master Maintenance Screen. Site OPR handles updates to the Agency Tour of
   Duty, Pattern table, and RCC table.
   3.4.2. Supervisory access. There is a Supervisory Employee Master Maintenance screen that a super-
   visor will be granted access. New employees can not be added and changes are limited. Also the
   SSAN field is blanked out. This is a good query for supervisors and timekeepers. Use this screen to
   enter employee personnel actions that result in changes to pay plans.
   3.4.3. Use the Employee Master Record window for employee personnel actions that result in perma-
   nent changes to the employee’s RCC.
   3.4.4. Adding and Removing Employee Records. Either the TAA OPR or a Product Directorate TAA
   OPR enter new employees to TAA using the Employee Master Record window. Obtain information
   needed to make transaction from the paperwork Personnel gives the employee and information perti-
   nent to the RCC where employee has been assigned. Do not expect SF50 to be part of the paperwork;
   SF50 tends to trail by several weeks. The site should decide the best approach for entering and remov-
   ing employee records to assure information is complete and correct. This function can be centralized
   for efficiency but should not be performed by the personnel function. The TAA site OPR should
   remove or delete erroneous employee additions.

3.5. Alternates. Backup approach for each function will be determined by each ALC. This will be some-
one from each PD, on most instances. Do not give alternate supervisors access to employee information
since these alternates generally rotate in and out. Instead, have another supervisor or PD POC substitute.
Should a supervisor be on extended absence, the Site OPR can give access to someone to fill in. In some
PDs, supervisors and timekeepers enter time and a PD POC will have access to their entire PD for
absences.

3.6. Bridge Run. These functions should reside with the Site OPR and backup (User Manual, section
5.3.9.2).

3.7. System Deployment. Should there be a problem, users will contact the OPR. The OPR will also use
the system broadcast message feature to advise the workforce that a new deplhe labor operations, material
operations, and other direct costs. G004L Sends JON Data to DIFMS (JON Opening). (Finance Require-
ment). DIFMS Sends Valid JON Listing to TAA. G004L sends L3A "WCD" to Planner.

3.8. Reconciliation. The source documents used to record the hours worked by each employee on each
job order shall be reconciled to the total payroll hours. Differences between labor hours recorded for pay-
roll purposes, payroll costs incurred and the labor hours and costs distributed to job orders and indirect
cost centers though the labor distribution system shall be reconciled and corrected each pay period. For
discrepancies that cannot be reconciled between job order records and payroll records without a major
expenditure of resources, the job order records shall be corrected to equal the payroll records. Differences
due to the use of average cost center labor rates shall be charged to general and administrative expenses.
10                                                                 AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003


For Phase I, reconciliation process will occur as it does today between TASYS/G037G and DCPS. Phase
II, reconciliation process is outside of TAA. Reconciliation is run in DIFMS and a Cost Analyst (or some-
one similar) that has access to DIFMS corrects. They may need to work with TAA personnel to determine
how to correct TAA.

3.9. Help desk and SPR. DISA will be using TIVOLI for help desk processing. The Ultimate Help Desk
Concept requires all trouble calls not resolved on-site by Defense Information System Agency (DISA)
Help Desk personnel or on-site System Analysts (SA) be forwarded to VIC for resolution. If the VIC is
unable to resolve the problem, then VIC personnel will then forward the trouble ticket to the appropriate
CDA/CMA for resolution. If CDA/CMA programmers have questions regarding the Trouble Ticket (TT),
the programmers will call the VIC and the VIC, in turn, will call local site for further clarification. See
DMAPS help desk process guide for more information.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                               11


                                                Chapter 4

                                    PRODUCTION PROCESSING

Processing is in one of four categories: Job Order Number (JON) labor, Inventory Tracking System (ITS/
G337), Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS/G097), and Facility and Equip-
ment Management (FEM/D130). Enter transactions per section 5.3.2 of the User Manual. Additional
instructions follow.

4.1. Production Delay. Production delay codes are the same used within the current Air Force produc-
tion systems: ITS, PDMSS and FEM. HQ AFMC/LGN will establish a process to add and delete delay
codes from TAA when they are added or deleted from the legacy systems.
   4.1.1. Production delay code 'R00' is the exception for ITS users. ‘R00’ delay code is used for a TAA
   Labor Stop. Two specific purposes are listed below:
       4.1.1.1. Use this code when more than one person works on a specific ITS track point. The last
       person working on the track point uses the normal delay or completion code, while the other
       works perform a TAA labor stop utilizing delay code ‘R00’.
       4.1.1.2. Another use of the 'R00' code is when a mechanic performs work on a second item while
       the first item is also in work, such as on an automated machine or tester (process time). If the labor
       standard includes observation time, the first item is delay coded using the 'R00' code allowing the
       mechanic to log work on the second item and continuing the flow time in ITS for the first item. If
       the labor standard for the first item does not include direct labor time for observation, use the nor-
       mal production delay code (R09 – processing time).

4.2. Production Start Procedure. AF Production Systems, ITS and PDMSS, require Start transactions
be performed. TAA has been designed with a START transaction that provides the status transaction back
to the Production Systems.
   4.2.1. ITS. This transaction is strictly a requirement for AF to send status transactions back to ITS.
   ITS is only interested in flow days and does not receive information from TAA by individuals. Busi-
   ness rules to begin labor:
       4.2.1.1. The 1st mechanic to wand labor to an operation on an ITS WCD will also wand a START.
       4.2.1.2. Using a bar coded ITS WCD, mechanic will wand a DELAY or COMPLETE for ending
       operation.
       4.2.1.3. Subsequent mechanics working the same operation will wand a DELAY (select delay rea-
       son from drop down menu) when ready to stop labor.
       4.2.1.4. Using a bar-coded ITS WCD with subsequent mechanics, only one mechanic can wand a
       COMPLETE; the other mechanics must FIRST wand DELAY. If a COMPLETE is transacted
       first, then the other mechanics will not be able to stop their labor with a DELAY.
   4.2.2. PDMSS. PDMSS labor transactions are statused by individual employee. PDMSS does allow
   rework authorizations. Business Rules to begin Labor:
       4.2.2.1. Using a bar-coded PDMSS WCD, mechanics will wand a START.
12                                                                   AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003


        4.2.2.2. Using a bar-coded PDMSS WCD, subsequent mechanic(s) will receive message that
        operation is already started and TAA will initiate LOGON to PDMSS.
     4.2.3. FEM. FEM does not get any status transactions from TAA. Due to the software used to build
     FEM, OPRs for FEM decided to accept dual inputs. Inputs required by FEM will be made to maintain
     FEM and labor will be entered in TAA with FEM data to get labor costs to proper JONs. Business
     Rules to Begin Labor:
        4.2.3.1. Using a bar-coded FEM Work Order, mechanic will wand a STOP.
        4.2.3.2. Using a bar-coded FEM Work Order, subsequent mechanics working the same work order
        will wand STOP.
        4.2.3.3. Using a bar-coded FEM Work Order with subsequent mechanics, only one mechanic can
        wand a COMPLETE.

4.3. Group and Bulk Processing.
     4.3.1. Supervisors use the RCC Mode transactions to input data covering all eligible employees
     within the RCC, such as holiday work, blanket transactions, and overtime.
     4.3.2. Group processing should also be used for repetitive type tasks and these tasks generally have
     small labor standards of 15 minutes or less. But, if group processing is used, a group processing trans-
     action must be made once an hour.
     4.3.3. Bulk should not be considered unless group processing can not be utilized, i.e. more than 300
     transactions per person per day.

4.4. Temporary Workloads. Except for ITS, temporary workload (User Manual, section 5.3.2.5) will be
transacted at the JON level in TAA. Direct employees will enter their own labor at the JON level using the
JON Labor button in TAA. Most Temporary Direct Labor will be input using the JON Labor screen in
TAA. These include Aircraft Temporary Workload JONs, Software JONs, Manufacturing JONs, and
Hourly A-JONs. The exception to those listed above: Temporary 206's which utilize ITS will continue to
have WCD steps that match operations in G004L and will be handled through the ITS Labor Window.

4.5. Standing JONs. Currently, indirect JONs will be used as standing JONs for production overhead
and G&A support personnel (User Manual, section 5.3.2.5). Should a direct person need a standing JON,
it will be identified when needed by the Supervisor of the direct employee. A direct employee that per-
forms work on the same JON on a continuous basis can be assigned to a standing direct JON in the
Employee Master record. There won’t be changes to Standing JONs at the end of the FY if only have
employees assigned to standing indirect JONs. Should a direct person be on direct JON at the end of the
FY, it will be the responsibility of the supervisor to make the change. This would be done via the Supervi-
sory Employee Master. This will be a rare occurrence.

4.6. Re-work time charge for PDMSS. Employees authorized to perform PDMSS rework (User Man-
ual, section 5.3.3.1) will be identified by their supervisors and Form 41 will request this access which is
given through the transaction code access identified in the user profiles.

4.7. Indirect JONs. The ALCs have set up indirect JONs to accommodate duty code/shred code combi-
nations that people are accustomed to seeing in H117 and G037G. The number of indirect JONs preclude
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                            13


them from being listed in a ‘drop’ down menu format in TAA. However, the listing of indirect JONs will
be made available during training just as the duty code/shred code combination list is available in TASYS.

4.8. Loans. RCC loans will be made by Supervisors/Timekeepers, which will change the current RCC in
the employee’s master record. Receiving supervisor will input the loan (User Manual, section 5.3.7.1.6).
The receiving supervisor will need to obtain the EMPLOYEE ID of the loaned employee to make the
transaction. Both the losing and gaining supervisors, as well as the employee, must communicate on this
transaction, especially involving shift change or flex shift. Length of loans is 999 hours maximum.
14                                                                   AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003


                                                 Chapter 5

                                              DATA ENTRY

5.1. Labor. Employees required to enter labor transactions must perform, at a minimum, a labor stop
within the last 15 minutes of their workday.

5.2. Standing JON. Employees on production overhead and general & administrative positions will be
placed on a “STANDING” Indirect JON. A ‘standing’ JON assumes the employee is at work, unless an
exception is input to the system. Labor will be charged to DIRECT or INDIRECT JONs.
     5.2.1. Direct JONs begin with 0-9 or A-T.
     5.2.2. Indirect JONs begin with X, Y or Z (in position 1) and were built using duty code/shred code
     combinations (in positions 6,7, and 8,9 or 10,11) from H117 to make the JONs more recognizable.
     Positions 2-5 represents the old general ledger code used to record labor such as 5110 for GS, 5111 for
     WG. Note: Accounting Organization Codes (AOCs) begin with the alpha M and end with alphas X, Y,
     and Z for overhead organizations.

5.3. Error Corrections. Known errors will appear after labor processing in the Daily Labor Correction
Process (DLCP). These errors should be corrected on a daily basis. The DLCP also allows labor records
to be input such as an employee taking leave and the supervisor forgets to make input. After labor has pro-
cessed, the supervisor/timekeeper must use the DLCP to add a labor record to account for the leave taken.
Corrections after the information for the pay period has been processed will be made to DCPS since TAA
does not allow prior-period corrections at this time.

5.4. Hours Worked Outside of Schedule. TAA covers several categories of overtime, compensatory
time and holiday worked. See section 5.3.5 of the User Manual.
     5.4.1. Supervisor is responsible for authorizing overtime worked, compensatory time worked, and
     holiday worked. Details will have to be worked out at each site based on existing labor agreements.
     The costs of overtime premium pay (that is, the amount paid for working overtime that is above the
     normal labor hour rate) shall not be charged directly to the applicable job order except when the over-
     time is clearly caused by the unique conditions of the job order.
     5.4.2. If an employee wands labor before their scheduled shift, past the end of their scheduled shift or
     on a non-workday, TAA will require an authorization transaction for that employee.
     5.4.3. Scheduled overtime on a normal workday must be put in before the start of the normal work-
     week, or use unscheduled overtime.
     5.4.4. If the employee works overtime/ comp time/ holidays and the supervisor never inputs the
     authorization, the employee will NOT receive compensation for the time worked.
     5.4.5. Overtime/ comp time/ holidays worked will be recorded in hundredth hour increments, but paid
     in quarter hour increments.
     5.4.6. An employee who works on a Holiday must receive Holiday Premium Pay for those hours
     worked during the employee’s normal scheduled day. Any hours worked outside the employee’s nor-
     mal tour of duty can be as compensatory time or overtime.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                              15


   5.4.7. An employee may not be given unscheduled overtime on a non-workday. For a non-workday,
   schedule an employee for overtime rather than using unscheduled overtime.
   5.4.8. Supervisors review employee work schedules for overtime. The work schedule should only
   show the employee’s regular tour of duty including any shift or night differential. Get help from the
   customer service representative and civilian pay liaison in the Financial Services Office for samples of
   work schedules and the proper coding of time worked. Proper coding of work hours (regular duty
   hours plus additional overtime hours) will assure employees receive the correct entitlements for time
   worked. Improper or incomplete coding can adversely affect employee entitlements causing a debt or
   underpayment. Regulatory guidance is Title 5 C. F. R. and DOD Financial Management Regulation,
   Volume 8. Various overtime codes are part of DCPS and TAA for use by depot employees.
       5.4.8.1. Overtime Scheduled (OS). Overtime that has been scheduled prior to the start of an
       administrative workweek and is regularly and consistently worked by an employee.
       5.4.8.2. Overtime Unscheduled (OU). Overtime which has not been scheduled prior to the start of
       an administrative workweek and is not known at time of need.
       5.4.8.3. Overtime Callback (OC). Overtime worked by an employee when they have completed
       the end of their duty day and have been called back to the work location.
       5.4.8.4. Overtime Unscheduled Exception (OX). This code typically involves job share or
       part-time employees who work non-scheduled days. DCPS determines if the hours worked should
       be coded as regular hours or overtime.
       5.4.8.5. Overtime Scheduled Not Worked (ON). This code records overtime that, through no fault
       of the employee, could not be worked as scheduled. These situations result primarily from court
       leave, military leave, and traumatic injury on the job.
   5.4.9. ALL overtime authorizations should be transacted on the same day the overtime is worked.
   First shift employees transactions are processed in the evening of the day that is worked. Second and
   third shift employees transactions are suspended until the evening of the day following their shift start
   with the exception of Saturday's 2nd and 3rd shift (end of week, end of pay period) which is processed
   Sunday morning.
   5.4.10. In NO case can overtime authorizations be made for a workday after processing for that work-
   day has begun. These can only be entered via the DLCP as a correction or addition to the existing
   record(s).

5.5. Certification. Supervisors are responsible for the validity of timekeeping records. Employees are
responsible for certifying that the time charged to job orders is correct. To cover payroll certification
requirements use the report from the Labor Attest/Verify screen that will allow a hard copy for signature
by supervisor and employee.
   5.5.1. Use the labor attest/verify report for payroll certification. The report can be viewed on-line for
   correctness and then printed. The report reflects the employee’s day by type hour code for the current
   pay period. Details for each day’s entry can be reviewed by selecting the DETAILS button.
   5.5.2. Any employee with errors that have not been corrected will have a message, written in blue,
   appear on the screen that indicates there are errors that still need correcting. The message will stay on
   the report until corrections have been made.
16                                                                   AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003


     5.5.3. Currently, previous pay period adjustments are done ONLY in DCPS. If corrections are made
     in DCPS, a print screen must be performed to capture the changes for the employee to initial. File this
     DCPS print with the current certification.
     5.5.4. The report will list each employee belonging to the requesting supervisor on a separate page.
     As the report is viewed on-line, each employee is also listed separately. Employees must sign the cer-
     tification statement on the report indicating their concurrence with the time as reported. The supervi-
     sor must sign this report, which becomes the certification.
     5.5.5. Payroll records must be kept for 6 years. The DCPS Customer Service Representative (CSR)
     must file certain documentation such as military leave documentation, jury duty and may not be avail-
     able for the timekeeper to maintain.

5.6. Deletion. Transaction data deletions should be very strictly controlled as this allows access to the
entire database (User Manual, section 5.3.7.2.2). There is a transaction data deletion access that is granted
as part of the default access that any employee receives; however, this deletion access is only for the trans-
actions performed by that employee. Transaction data deletion access that the OPR assigns gives access to
all employees and will be very restrictive in its application.

5.7. Holiday Work.
     5.7.1. Holiday work transactions for scheduled workdays must be made on a valid holiday. Normally,
     supervisors authorize premium pay for holiday callback. The work must be during a scheduled work-
     day that falls on a holiday and must be within the employees' regularly scheduled shift.
     5.7.2. If a holiday falls on a full-time employee's nonscheduled workday, that employee is entitled to
     an ‘in lieu of’ holiday (User Manual, section 5.3.5.1.3). Supervisors must determine the appropriate
     'in lieu of' holiday for each employee and make the appropriate leave transaction for holiday leave for
     each affected employee.
     5.7.3. Holiday work transactions are not authorized for intermittent employees.

5.8. Temporary Duty.
     5.8.1. Enter temporary duty for JON, ITS, PDMSS, and FEM using the TAA TDY screens.
     5.8.2. Temporary Duty for Non Workday. In TAA (Users Manual, section 5.3.5.1.2). A supervisor/
     timekeeper performs an overtime (or comp earned) authorization for the non-workday travel and then
     TDY transaction for the time employee is gone. An FWS (W*) employee who travels on a non-work-
     day is entitled to compensation and will require the following transactions be performed:
        5.8.2.1. Overtime or Compensatory Time Authorization for the day of travel.
        5.8.2.2. JON labor transacted against the travel JON for the day of travel.
        5.8.2.3. TDY would be transacted for the first workday following the travel day.

5.9. Leave. Supervisors and/or timekeepers are to enter. Supervisors can input leave to TAA and the
employee must certify their indirect charges.
     5.9.1. Supervisors must approve leave and review what is recorded in the system. Leave transactions
     input after labor has processed must be input using the DLCP.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                              17


   5.9.2. Mechanics should not be inputting their own leave. Each site will have to set up the system
   accordingly by providing access through transaction codes (see paragraph 2).
   5.9.3. Employee certification can be by printing the report from the Labor Attest/Verify screen or
   some other means. Indirect JONs for leave have been established and are linked to the DCPS code that
   applies. Leave JONs for DMAPS Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be the same. The only time a leave JON
   might change is if a pay policy change is made that requires a new JON or a leave category is taken
   away.
   5.9.4. The TAA user manual (Section 5.3.6) covers entries for other types of absences to include reli-
   gious time, credit hours, and military.

5.10. Environmental and Hazardous Duty. Eligibility is built through personnel action. The type of
duty requires entry of appropriate codes in the labor transactions (User Manual, section 5.3.7.1).

5.11. Alternate Work Schedule. Where authorized and used, enter AWS changes, including pattern
codes, at the beginning of the pay period (User Manual, section 5.3.7.1.5).

5.12. Injury Documentation. Traumatic injury transactions are similar to transactions for other types of
leave. However, the transactions require the date of traumatic injury transaction to be processed on a prior
day. Supervisors must assure documentation is received from personnel before entering transactions. Fol-
lowing are procedures for entering information in TAA (User Manual, section 5.3.7.1.10).
   5.12.1. After employee master record has been initialized in TAA.
       5.12.1.1. At main menu of TAA, select table maintenance. Select forward. Select traumatic injury.
       Hit OK.
       5.12.1.2. Enter employee ID of person updating table. Enter password. Hit OK.
       5.12.1.3. Type employee ID of person to be updated or search tour of duty by typing full or partial
       (at least one character). Enter employee name (last first mi). Hit OK.
   5.12.2. If searched by name, select a record by clicking on the applicable row to receive the empty
   maintenance window or to retrieve any existing injury records. If employee ID was entered, cursor
   will be positioned in the injury date text box.
       5.12.2.1. Input injury date, actual date injured in MMDDYYYY format (e.g., LU code in DCPS).
       5.12.2.2. System will derive injury number based on injury date entry.
       5.12.2.3. Input injury time (best guess if not documented on CA-1)
       5.12.2.4. Input first LT transaction date in MMDDYYYY format, if traumatic leave was used.
       5.12.2.5. System will calculate injury not-to-exceed date (based on DCPS policy). For this infor-
       mation the user has two options: (1) check I25’s from H117 or (2) use DCPS looking for LU code
       and first entry of LT code tied to that injury number)
       5.12.2.6. Hit OK
   5.12.3. You will receive message “Transaction Accepted”. Hit RESTART to enter the next
   employee’s ID number or name and traumatic information.

5.13. Attendance. The Air Force will not use the attendance functionality available in the TAA system
(reference TAA User Manual Section 5.3.4, Attendance). The site will assure the employees' assignment
codes in TAA do not allow for usage of that capability.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                            19

                                  INTER DIVISIONAL SUPPORT

6.1. Overall. The "only" approved Air Force legacy systems that will interface to DMAPS TAA are the
following: Aircraft/Missile (Programmed) Workloads- G037E/G097 (PDMSS); Temporary (Non-Pro-
grammed) Workloads- G004L/G337 (ITS); Equipment "PMEL Only" Workloads- E046B/D130 (FEM)
and Commodity (Programmed) Workloads- E046B/G337 (ITS). When process work is required outside
of the owning directorate/division requesting support, the Interdivisional Support Form is filled out and
routed to the performing directorate/division accompanied with discreet technical data required IAW
AFMCI 21-110. The performing directorate/division completes their portion of the form identifying the
flow days, labor standards, and material requirements. The performing directorate/division then creates
the WCD's, establishes the labor standards, and waits to receive the asset through the CRITS receiving
area. All non-AREP shops shall use E046B and G337 for labor and shop floor tracking. Performing PDs
shall be responsible for Labor Standard and WCD development for their own RCCs, using E046B/
G337.Performing PDs shall be responsible for Material Standard development for their own RCCs, using
G005M. Performing PDs will take their own production count. Aircraft sales price shall be computed
using the performing RCC/Rates/Standards in lieu of the current Aircraft composite rate. Assumptions:
Owning and performing divisions will use same Production Number/JONs. WCDs for routed items will
be discontinued in PDMSS and generated in ITS.PDMSS WCD shall contain an informational step for
routed items. CRITS receiving area shall be established to receive all routed items for tracking purposes.

6.2. Level for Labor Collection. The "level" at which labor will be clocked/collected within these sys-
tems in terms of the respective Work Control Documents (WCD's) /Routing operations/ sub-operations or
tasks will be determined via the Planning Team concept through the joint efforts of the Production Plan-
ner, Production Supervisor, Scheduler and the Workloader. The knowledgeable Production Planners
within each Product Directorate, in coordination with the Supervisor and the Workloader, will perform
this review and decide upon the appropriate level of labor tracking and materiel standard development and
linking. The Production Planners, Production Supervisors, Schedulers and Workloaders have the knowl-
edge and training required for this effort. Judicial judgement is required for the performance of these
tasks.

6.3. Inventory Tracking System (ITS) G337. The Inventory Tracking System will be used for multiple
types of workload that include the following:
   6.3.1. Commodity/Exchangeable/MISTR (Programmed) Workloads. (Production Number (PDN)
   example 14759A). Production Numbers (PDN's), end item and repair component part numbers and
   the corresponding Work Control Documents (WCD's) must be established within G337/ITS. Note:
   Structure list, PDN by Planning Organization/Planner Technician Code (PO/PTC) report can be uti-
   lized from ITS to determine if all PDN's have been input.
   6.3.2. The ITS WCD numbers must be input into the last six (6) positions of the Labor Standard
   Mechanization System (E046B) operation description line, for all operations whose work content is
   covered by the ITS WCD. Note: ITS will receive a daily interface from E046B that updates the labor
   standards within ITS at the sub-operation level.
   6.3.3. The selected track level for a WCD will determine how the labor will be associated between the
   E046B and the sub-operation level on the ITS WCD. If the WCD is set at track level "A" every
20                                                                  AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003


     sub-operation on the WCD, that is coded as tracked, must have an associated labor sub-operation
     within E046B. The sub-operation numbers within E046B must be the same as the sub-operation num-
     bers on the ITS WCD to allow for the association of labor. If the WCD is set at a track level ‘B’, only
     those sub-operations ending in ‘0’ will be tracked and have an associated labor sub-operation within
     E046B. The sub-operation numbers within E046B must be the same as the sub-operation numbers on
     the ITS WCD to allow for the association of labor. The WCD sub-operation numbers ending in other
     than ‘0’ will be non-tracked and will not have E046B labor associated. Labor for non-tracked
     sub-operations will be accounted for in the preceding tracked sub-operation.
     6.3.4. Following the daily interface from E046B to ITS, a Mismatch report (screen QN2157) should
     be run by the Production Planner for each PDN. The report will be compared to the PDN/WCD's
     established within ITS to verify that all ITS sub-operations (tasks) on the report have a matching
     sub-operation (task) on the ITS WCD. E046B, ITS (G337) must be corrected to verify there is a "com-
     plete" match between both systems, where direct labor applies. Under this concept, there will be no
     sub-operations (tasks) resident within ITS that does not have corresponding sub-operations (tasks)
     resident within E046B (direct labor), additionally, there should be no sub-operations (tasks) resident
     within E046B that does not have corresponding sub-operations (tasks) resident within ITS (direct
     labor).
        6.3.4.1. ITS has sub-operations that are coded as "informational only" and as the name implies,
        are used to display information (i.e. hazardous material warnings, special instructions etc.) on the
        WCD. These sub-operations will not have a matching E046B sub-operation.
        6.3.4.2. The E046B system also has supplemental information listed using a sub-operation num-
        ber and these will "not" have a matching sub-operation number in the ITS. If the WCD is coded as
        a Track Level 'B' document, then only those sub-operations ending in a '0' will have a matching
        labor sub-operation in the E046B system and all others will be "non-tracked" and will not have a
        labor sub-operation associated.
        6.3.4.3. The E046B system has the ability to accommodate "X" labor operations. Currently, "X"
        operations are generally utilized for crediting direct labor hours to back shops for miscellaneous
        support items such as plating miscellaneous parts. "X" operations are always automatic count
        regardless of the "M" or "A" Production Count Indicator (PCI) within G004L. These parts may or
        may not have a legacy system WCD/routing document. Currently, this means that the back shops
        will receive production count "Not" tied to a specific routing task. However, under DMAPS TAA
        implementation, this process will change. Under DMAPS, Production Planners will be required to
        include Miscellaneous part repairs in existing ITS WCD's/routings (supported by corresponding
        sub-operations within E046B) or develop separate ITS WCD's/routings specifically for miscella-
        neous parts that were previously supported by "X" labor operations. In other words, RCCs that uti-
        lize “X” labor standard s will not be utilized in support of DMAPS. All WCDs and labor standards
        will be developed to the task level.
        6.3.4.4. Direct Labor within E046B needs to be examined with special emphasis to the impact on
        the employees having to "clock" time. Currently, there may be indirect personnel counted as
        direct. If maintained in E046B, a WCD will have to be generated in order to clock their time, or
        the workers will be assigned to an indirect JON. For example, Production Planners, Schedulers,
        Expeditors and Forklift Operators fall into this category. New MISTR workload must first be
        established within E046B.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                             21


6.4. Temporary (Non-Programmed) Workloads. Temporary (Non-Programmed) Workloads will be
broken down by Production Number prefix): T prefix for repair (PDN example: T1479A). M prefix for
new manufacture (PDN example: M5455K).
   6.4.1. These temporary workloads will continue to be planned and input into the Job Order Produc-
   tion Master System (G336/G004L) as is accomplished today. Detailed planning will be required to
   identify each operation (task) that a Mechanic/Technician will be required to perform to "manufac-
   ture" or "repair" that part and will be manually linked to a specific RCC/Work Center within the
   Inventory Tracking System (ITS) at the sub-operation (task) level. For job order batching needs, Pro-
   duction Planners will establish labor standards based upon the batch quantity instead of the typical
   labor standard for a discrete job order quantity of one.
   6.4.2. Those operations (tasks) as defined within G336/G004L must "also" be manually input into
   ITS as sub-operations (tasks). In order to generate the required G337 (ITS) WCD, the responsible Pro-
   duction Planner must input a complete planning package into the G337 system. The G336/G004L
   operation (tasks) numbers must match the ITS sub-operation (task) numbers, therefore, G336/G004L
   operations (tasks) equate to ITS sub-operations (tasks). The WCD number must be placed on the
   G004L operation description line in the last 6 positions of the field. An interface will bring the labor
   hours at the operation level from G336/G004L to the sub-operational level within G337/ITS.
      6.4.2.1. Production Planners must link the material to be consumed to specific sub-operations
      (tasks) within ITS by linking the material on the G336/G004L temporary labor plan to the appli-
      cable operation (task) number.
   6.4.3. Interdivisional Support Aircraft/Missile Routed Items Type Workload Procedure. Interdivi-
   sional Support for Aircraft/Missile Routed Item Workload will be accomplished in the following man-
   ner. (Example: An item is removed from an Aircraft (LA) or a missile (LM) and is routed to a shop
   within another Product Directorate (LI).
      6.4.3.1. All non-Aircraft Repair Enhancement Program (AREP) shops shall utilize E046B and
      ITS/G337for labor and shop floor tracking purposes.
      6.4.3.2. To assist in the development of the necessary WCD's for ITS, the "Owning" AREP Pro-
      duction Planners will use the G037E Routed Item Listing (A-G037E-D20-D1-M65) to identify all
      the routed item part numbers to the "performing" Directorate Production Planners. This report will
      list each routed item component identified to a remove operation. This list will be used to deter-
      mine if an item has a planned route.
      6.4.3.3. The AREP Production Planner will interrogate the Routed Items Listing by Weapon Sys-
      tem Design Code (WSDC). The AREP PDMSS "Owning" Production Planner will work closely
      with the "Performing" Product Directorate Production Planner to identify all routed items requir-
      ing ITS WCD, labor standard (E046B) and material standard (G005M) data development.
      6.4.3.4. The "Performing" Product Directorate Production Planners are responsible for the ITS
      WCD, E046B labor standard and G005M material standard data development.
      6.4.3.5. The development of Work Control Documents (WCD's) for routed items will be discon-
      tinued within G037E/PDMSS and will be developed and generated within ITS by the "Perform-
      ing" Production Planner.
      6.4.3.6. The G037E/PDMSS WCD/card shall only contain an informational step for routed items.
      The WCD/card will also be used for scheduling purposes.
22                                                                 AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003


        6.4.3.7. The "Owning" and "Performing" Product Directorates will utilize the same Production
        Numbers (PDN's) and Job Order Number (JON’s). This concept will allow all costs to be rolled up
        to the aircraft/missile etc. for that PDN/JON. The "Performing" Product Directorate Production
        Planners are responsible for labor standard development and WCD development for their own
        RCC's/shops utilizing E046B and ITS/G337 for those routed items.
           6.4.3.7.1. The same aircraft or missile production number/control number will be used within
           ITS/G337, E046B and G005M.
           6.4.3.7.2. Production count will be taken the same way it is today during DMAPS Phase I.
           However, in DMAPS Phase II, production count will be taken automatically within AF
           DMAPS TAA as work is transacted by mechanics/technicians. The aircraft sales price for
           these routed items shall be computed using the performing RCC rates and standards in lieu of
           the current aircraft composite rate. Since repair hours for routed items will no longer be resi-
           dent within G037E/G097 (PDMSS), it will become necessary to perform two separate hour
           roll-ups; i.e. total hours by Production Number (PDN), Job Order Number (JON) in G037E/
           G097 (PDMSS) as is accomplished today, as well as an hour roll-up for the same PDN, JON
           resident within the E046B/G337 (ITS) system. The labor hours would then be manually com-
           bined from both systems to obtain the correct total labor hours/costs required for the aircraft.
           6.4.3.7.3. The "Performing" Product Directorate Production Planners shall also be responsible
           for the material standard development for those routed items for their own RCC's utilizing
           G005M. The G005M/Production System G030 Mismatch Report could indicate the material is
           consumed within a valid operation, production number, and RCC combination. However, it
           might not be the correct operation. This type of condition will appear as a match on the report
           even though it’s incorrect. The Production Planner is required to validate that every part num-
           ber is being consumed at the correct operation number for a specific G005M BOM.
           6.4.3.7.4. Upon the completion of this data development activity for routed items, the "Per-
           forming" Product Directorate Production Planners will notify the "Owning" AREP Production
           Planner, at which time the WCD's/routes will be removed from G037E/G097 (PDMSS). At
           this time, the "Owning" AREP Production Planner will then run the Routed Items Listing
           (A-G037E-D20-D1-M65) against each WSDC and will manually remove those routed items
           from this list. This removal of the routed items from this Routed Items List and the removal of
           the operations from G037E/G097 (PDMSS) is a manual process for these Interdivisional Sup-
           port of Routed Workload items.
           6.4.3.7.5. To ensure that the WCD's/routes are resident within ITS for PDMSS routes from
           other directorates: The G037E routed item listing will be reviewed for interdivisional routed
           items by the "Owning" AREP Production Planner.
     6.4.4. Transacting at the JON Level. When transacting at the JON level within DMAPS TAA the
     "Workload Competition Flag" must be changed to "N" for No.
        6.4.4.1. "T" prefix Quarterly Support Workloads: (PDN Example: T2579I). With this type of
        workload, a specific number of man-hours are provided to specific shops on a quarterly basis to
        perform miscellaneous types of support. Specifics as to the exact type of support are normally
        "not" known in advance.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                              23


      6.4.4.2. "A" prefix Field Team or TDY Support Workloads: (PDN Example: A2525N). With this
      type of workload, a specific number of man-hours are provided to perform support at a specific
      geographical location
      6.4.4.3. These temporary workloads will continue to be planned and input into the Job Order Pro-
      duction Master System (G336/G004L) as is accomplished today. Since the tasks are not normally
      known in advance, the mechanic/technician will keep track of the labor hours expended on each
      JON and will transact at the JON level within DMAPS TAA. The mechanic/technician will be pro-
      vided a paper product (AFMC Form 237 or G004L L3A), that they will use to know which JON
      that they will transact labor upon.
      6.4.4.4. OO-ALC TIS Software Division. Since this division currently uses a Lotus Notes/Access
      system to track all software workload at the task level by person, this area will also transact within
      TAA at the JON level. Under this concept, as each Software Engineer performs work on various
      JON's throughout the course of the day, each Software Engineer will keep track of the hours
      expended on each JON and these hours will be input directly into DMAPS TAA by that Software
      Engineer. Lotus Notes/Access paper will be provided to the Software Engineers so they are aware
      of which JON's to transact their time upon by task The development of Work Control Documents
      (WCD's) for routed items will be discontinued within G037E/PDMSS and will be developed and
      generated within ITS by the "Performing" Production Planner.
      6.4.4.5. The development of Work Control Documents (WCD's) for routed items will be discon-
      tinued within G037E/PDMSS and will be developed and generated within ITS by the "Perform-
      ing" Production Planner. The development of Work Control Documents (WCD's) for routed items
      will be discontinued within G037E/PDMSS and will be developed and generated within ITS by
      the "Performing" Production Planner.
   6.4.5. Temporary (Non-Programmed) Workloads within the Aircraft/Missiles and PDMSS. When
   transacting at the JON level within DMAPS TAA the "Workload Competition Flag" must be changed
   to "N" for No. These temporary workloads will continue to be planned and input into the Job Order
   Production Master System (G336/G004L) as is accomplished today. Since the tasks are not normally
   known in advance, the mechanic/technician will keep track of the labor hours expended on each JON
   and will transact at the JON level within DMAPS TAA. The mechanic/technician will be provided a
   paper product (AFMC Form 237 or G004L L3A etc.), that they will use to know which JON that they
   will transact labor upon. As soon as the capability is provided to process temporary (Non-Pro-
   grammed) workloads within G097/PDMSS this solution will be discontinued.
   6.4.6. Cost Class Four Workloads. "S" prefix Cost Class Four Support (a specific number of hours are
   provided on a monthly basis and are used for the repair of a particular shops own equipment) (Exam-
   ple: S1459I): "S" JON's will become "X" JON's in the future. Each shop requiring this type of Cost
   Class Four support will establish the required indirect JON's. All labor hour transacting for this type
   of support will be transacted at the Indirect JON level within DMAPS TAA.

6.5. G097 and G037E.
   6.5.1. PDMSS produces the barcode on the WCD at the operation level, which will be the level where
   labor will be clocked/collected and where that shop will automatically earn hours (upon operation
   completion) beginning in DMAPS Phase II. To ensure the WCD’s for aircraft/missile labor operations
24                                                                  AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003


     are correct, the WCD’s will be reviewed to ensure a match with the labor operations in G037E/G097
     (PDMSS). The on-line PDMSS Users Manual is used as a reference for updating the WCD.
     6.5.2. Special emphasis must be placed upon reviewing direct labor, which may be indirect. A Pro-
     duction Planner, Scheduler, Forklift Operator or Expeditor are examples of where they are being con-
     sidered direct, but no WCD’s are currently being generated. Under DMAPS, if the Forklift Operator
     or Expeditor etc. is considered direct, a WCD will have to be generated and the time will have to be
     clocked by that function. An alternative could be to identify that function as production overhead.
     6.5.3. All Interdivisional Support Shop routed items must have a WCD established in PDMSS or ITS
     by the performing Production Planner. The Interdivisional Support of Routed Item procedures is iden-
     tified above.
     6.5.4. Materiel standards are to be linked to the operation where the materiel will be consumed. The
     G005M BOM parts list should be compared to the WCD to verify the materiel is assigned to the cor-
     rect G037E/G097 (PDMSS) operation where the materiel will be consumed. The G072A-G01 report
     lists labor standards without materiel and can be used for an additional check to ensure materiel stan-
     dards are linked to all appropriate operations.G037E and PDMSS are always in sync due to the daily
     interfaces between these two systems. All workload is currently being planned/worked in PDMSS at
     the operation/task level. These procedures will be updated when the Temporary Workload capability
     is provided within G037E/G097 (PDMSS).
     6.5.5. Criteria: Production Number validation of the WCD with Labor Standard and Materiel Stan-
     dards. (Pseudo PDN’s are valid non matches (P job designator). G005M/Production System G030
     Mismatch Report will be used to report on the Materiel Effort.

6.6. Facility Equipment Maintenance System (D130/FEM): PMEL Workload Only. There is noth-
ing unique for FEM to do in order to prepare for DMAPS implementation. From the onset of FEM, they
have been required to ensure the operation level in FEM agrees with the labor E046B at the operation
level. To prepare for DMAPS implementation, the Production Planner will review and/or revise the FEM
WCD and labor standard within E046B to the appropriate operation level.
     6.6.1. Currently, in terms of data development for PMEL workload labor hours, the required base
     hours will already be available within E046B for the passing of these hours to the applicable Produc-
     tion Number (PDN), Resource Control Center (RCC), operation number (task) and work order resi-
     dent within FEM/D130 via an interface. Through the use of the AF DMAPS TAA System, actual
     hours will be collected for operations (tasks) performed. For FEM/PMEL workloads, Mechanics/
     Technicians "will" wand barcodes for the collection of actual labor hours and will be provided
     labor-input screens for the addition of this actual labor hour data. For job order batching needs, when
     applicable, Production
     6.6.2. Planners will establish labor standards based upon the batch quantity instead of the typical
     labor standard for a discrete job order quantity of one.
     6.6.3. For "Temporary Workloads" the labor plan will continue to be manually added to the G336/
     G004L system as is accomplished today, however, a more detailed planning effort may be required to
     identify each operation (task) that will be required for the repair. Additionally, each of the G336/
     G004L operations (tasks) will be linked and "manually added" to the FEM system. Both G336/G004L
     and FEM work orders must match in terms of operation (task) numbers. PMEL/ FEM workload
     requirements will be generated within the FEM system.
AFMCI21-136 6 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                               25


       6.6.3.1. All "Temporary/FEM Workload" material requirements will be loaded into the G336/
       G004L system and are to be linked to the operation (task) number where the material will be con-
       sumed within FEM. The operation (task) numbers within G336/G004L and FEM are to be the
       same.
       6.6.3.2. New workloads must first be established within E046B for FEM/PMEL workloads and
       G336/G004L for Temporary workloads.
       6.6.3.3. Direct Labor within E046B/FEM needs to be examined. Currently there "may" be indi-
       rect personnel counted as direct. If maintained in E046B/FEM, a WCD will have to be generated
       in order to clock their time, or the workers will be assigned to an indirect JON. For example, Pro-
       duction Planners, Schedulers, Expeditors and Forklift Operators fall into this category.
       6.6.3.4. New G030 "Mismatch Reports" have been developed that will assist the Production Plan-
       ners in systematically identifying those mismatches that require correction.
   6.6.4. Routed items are not applicable to FEM.
   6.6.5. Criteria. FEM Production Number validation of the WCD’s with Labor and Materiel Standards.

6.7. Job Order Production Master System (G004L). The goal is to load only valid JON's into TAA.
The Funds Manager within the Product Directorates will review the current G004L Permanent Job Master
(PJM) and Temporary Job Master (TJM) for open JON's. These are JON's with a JON status of 0. JON's,
that are no longer required, will be closed (use of the EPS overawed JON product will assist in this effort).
G004L L2B and L3B error lists will be reviewed and appropriate actions taken (PON/PCN match). The
G004L G1A Validation Tables will be reviewed to ensure the PON and PCN match. Appropriate action(s)
will be taken to correct mismatches. All materiel backorders against closed JON's will be cancelled. Reg-
ulations used in this area are: AFMC R 66-60 (Draft), AFMC R 66-61, and AFMC R 66-62. No Status
Code 3 (cancelled) JON’s are to be initialized into DMAPS. Criteria: Validation of JON’s by the Product
Directorates.

                                                Chapter 7

              PLANNING FOR PROGRAMMED PRODUCTION (DMAPS PHASE II)

7.1. AREP.
     7.1.1. Plan for PDMSS JOQ. Planners shall establish the labor hours based on the batch quantity
     (instead of for the typical JOQ of one) to facilitate batch processing.
     7.1.2. Create Master Plan in G037E. Planner uses G037E to plan and control the modification and
     repair of aircraft and other project type workloads. Planner develops and maintains labor standards in
     E046B (LSMSM) as required. The planner manually inputs base hours into G037E using either
     E046B computed base hours or his manually developed base hours. G037E validates input using the
     new RCC/Skill code file.
     7.1.3. Pass Detail Plan to G097. When the planner selects operation to be included in a given over-
     haul, G097 extracts base hours from G037E for detail plan.
     7.1.4. G097 System Triggers. The activity which will trigger the submission of tasks to DDS and
     TAA. Triggered when scheduler changes status code to 0.
        7.1.4.1. G097 to DDS. Automatically extract from G097 (PDMSS) the following information:
        Weapon System Design Code, Operation Number, Weapon ID, (TAA Item Tracking Number 1),
        Operation Number, (TAA Item Tracking Number 2). Upon electronic notification from G097,
        DMAPS Data Store shall automatically read this table and add data.
        7.1.4.2. G097 to TAA. Automatically extract, from PDMSS, the following information: System
        Designator (PDMSS), Weapon System Design Code, Operation Number, Weapon ID (TAA Item
        Tracking Number), Operation Number, (TAA Item Tracking Number 2), Control Number, Job
        Designator, RCC, Base Hours. Automatically read this file and add data to TAA.

7.2. DREP.
     7.2.1. Build WCDs in G337. Planners build Labor Standards to support sub-operation level (to sup-
     port production count). Planners compare Labor Standards structure to WCD structure to insure that
     production count is collected correctly. Planners may need to give special consideration regarding
     JOQ, Occurrence Factors, Natural Breakpoints, WCD Structure, and Operation/ Sub-operation Struc-
     tures when planning labor and material for DMAPS process.
        7.2.1.1. E046B to G337. E046B (LSMSM) sends base hours, at Sub Operation level on a daily
        basis to G337.
        7.2.1.2. Modify Base Hours (Permanent Workloads). On a daily basis E046B will send to G337
        base hours for permanent workloads. G337 receive base hours using an existing feed from E046B.
        G337 will calculate PF&D value using base hours times PF&D. G337 will calculate total base
        hours, summing PF&D value plus base hours. G337 will not perform a calculation using the sub
        operation occurrence factor provided by E046B. In addition, the QN2140 screen and reports need
        to be updated to reflect the above changes (e.g., base hours, PF&D and total hours).
     7.2.2. Develop and Maintain Labor Standard in E046B. Planners develop and maintain labor stan-
     dards in E046B (LSMSM) at the sub-operation level. This activity identifies if the labor standard is
     engineered or non-engineered. These values are used to determine the direct labor costs for EISP.

   Changes to Base Hours in Legacy systems shall implement an effective business rule. Base hour
   changes shall be applied only to newly (future) inducted work. Base hours shall not be changed in
   DMAPS Data Store or TAA.
   7.2.3. Plan for ITS JOQ. Planners establish the labor hours based on the batch quantity (instead of for
   the typical JOQ of one) to facilitate batch processing.
   7.2.4. G337 System Trigger.
      7.2.4.1. Generate Mismatch Report. G337 (or a report writer) provides a new Labor Mismatch
      Report meeting the following requirements: automated, user selectable frequency contains only
      exceptions (mismatches). G337 will contain an edit that will not allow a WCD to be printed that
      has any mismatches between E046B and G337 tasks.
      7.2.4.2. Mechanic requests the printing of a WCD via a G337 screen.
      7.2.4.3. G337 to DDS. Automatically extract from G337 (ITS) the following information: Inven-
      tory Tracking Number (TAA Item Tracking Number 1), Track Point (TAA Item Tracking Number
      2).
      7.2.4.4. G337 to TAA. New interface: "near real time" and event driven. Automatically extract,
      from ITS, the following information: Inventory Tracking Number (TAA Item Tracking Number
      #1), Track Point (TAA Item Tracking Number #2), Operation Number, Sub Operation Number,
      Prod Number/JON, RCC, Base Hours. Automatically read this file and add data to TAA.

7.3. Facility and Equipment Maintenance.

   for the typical JOQ of one) to facilitate batch processing.
   7.3.2. Build WCDs in D130. Planners build PMEL WCD tasks in FEM.
   7.3.3. Develop Main Labor Std in E046B. FEM only supports PMEL workloads. Planners develop
   and maintain labor standards in E046B (LSMSM) at the operation level. This activity identifies if the
   labor standard is engineered or non-engineered. These values are used to determine the direct labor
   costs for EISP.
      7.3.3.1. D130 Uses E046B Base Hours. On a daily basis, extract base hours, at the operation level,
      from E046B. On a daily basis, read this file and update D130.
      7.3.3.2. Provide Data to TAA/DDS. Source Input for Legacy/TAA shared data FEM. Modif FEM
      to provide data to TAA and DMAPS/DDS (via Conversion Application). Create 'FEM to CAPP'
      table and store data to send to TAA. Table will contain the following data elements: System Des-
      ignator (FEM), Work Order Number, Control Number, Job Designator, JON Suffix, Performing
      RCC, Base Hours, Skill Code, and Change Date/Time. Modify FEM to accept/process data from
      TAA. Create 'TAA to FEM' table to receive and store data from TAA. Table will contain the fol-
      lowing data elements: Employee Number, RCC, and Expended Hours, Status (Stop, Complete
      Transaction), Date/Time. Modify FEM to accept/utilize TAA Employee Id's assigned all DMAG
      employees.
      7.3.3.3. D130 (FEM) to CE (Inductions). Automatically extract from D130 (FEM) the following
      information: Work Order Number (TAA Item Tracking Number 1), Operation Number, (TAA
      Item Tracking Number #2), Prod Number, RCC, Equip Id, Base Hours, Date. Upon electronic

     notification from D130, the Conversion Application automatically reads this file and generates
     new input file for DIFMS TAA and DIFMS Data Store.
     7.3.3.4. D130 (FEM) to CE (Completions). On a daily basis FEM will provide both Direct and
     indirect completion data to G004L via CE. These records will identify closed Work Orders. Trig-
     gered when the FEM Work Order Status is changed to CLOSE. CE will add the value for JON
     Suffix, merge with Induction data, and forward the FEM records to G004L in a compatible format
     that FEM currently uses to pass the information to G004L.
     7.3.3.5. Process Prod No./JON Data. On a NRT basis, automatically process FEM Work Order
     Induction input file and set values for JON Suffix. On a NRT basis, insert complete record into
     TAA temp table. On a NRT basis, insert complete record into DDS temp table. On a Daily basis,
     process FEM Direct CJob JON Completion input file and set value for JON Suffix. On a Daily
     basis, merge NRT and Daily input into an output file for G004L.
     7.3.3.6. CE to TAA. On a daily basis, automatically reads G004L (JOPMS) 'Temp Job Order
     Number Master ' file and FEM TAA input file. On a daily basis, creates TAA input file with com-
     plete record data (as defined in Business Rules).

   transportation, lodging, and per diem.
   8.1.5. Planner Sets SOPI to "C" for Complete. When all planning has been completed, the planner
   changes the SOPI (Status of Planning Indicator) from an "I" (Incomplete) to a "C" (Complete). That
   triggers the transmission of data to G004L. G004L Receives Planning Data. G004L Establishes Pro-
   duction Number & EISP based on the labor operations, material operations, and other direct costs.
   G004L Sends JON Data to DIFMS (JON Opening - Finance Requirement). DIFMS sends valid JON
   listing to TAA. G004L sends BOM data to ABOM. G004L sends L3A "WCD" to Planner.
   8.1.6. Planner Reviews L3A. Planner Reviews L3A for accuracy and completeness. If errors are
   found, then amendments to G004L are made.

      mechanic will know what Production Number JONs to charge his labor to and which operations to
      order material against.
   8.1.8. Scheduler/Mechanic Buys Material via ABOM.
   8.1.9. Planner Provides JON Data to Supervisor. Planner provides JON Data to Supervisor. Since no
   WCD is produced for A-Jobs, the proper production number JON must be communicated very clearly.
   8.1.10. Supervisor/Mechanic Uses Production Number JON for Exceptions in TAA. Supervisor/
   Mechanic Uses Production Number JON for Exceptions in TAA. Normally A-Jobs supports CLSS
   TDY type workloads. Since the mechanic is usually TDY, the supervisor will be responsible for enter-
   ing the employee's labor hours against the proper Production Number JON in TAA.
      8.1.10.1. Labor is keyed in TAA at the JON Level. Supervisors and/or mechanics key in labor in
      TAA at the JON level.

                          ADDITIONAL DMAPS PHASE II PROCESSING

9.1. Overhead Application Rates. TAA will provide the information to produce a report of the average
unaccelerated direct and indirect labor rates by RCC (Production Cost Center) and Indirect Cost Centers
(AOC) for manual input into H033. Indirect rates will be calculated for all shops. Results will use a simple
average of the total hourly rates for a given RCC divided by the number of employees within that Shop.
Although SSN is used as a key field to tie the Shop to the employee, it will not be portrayed on the report.
Enter actual direct and indirect labor rates from report generated in TAA into H033. Entered will be a sim-
ple average of the total hourly rates for a given RCC (Shop) divided by the number of employees within
that shop.

9.2. Group Labor Processing.
   9.2.1. ITS will be Near Real Time. TAA creates and forwards operation starts, delays and completes
   as required.
   9.2.2. G097 is a batch process. TAA creates and forwards over night batch operation starts, delays,
   completes along with employee logon/logoffs as required. Same business rules as other transactions.

9.3. Reversal of Complete. TAA will accommodate current pay period reversals utilizing the DLCP
process.
   9.3.1. For ITS, TAA will have the ability to reverse a completed task and re-open. Utilizing a new
   screen, a new track point type code of "U" will be passed from TAA to ITS. ITS will then change the
   print flag from a "Y" to a "N", remove the ship date and complete flag on the document ID.
   9.3.2. For G097, upon receipt of "X" transaction, TAA will uncomplete the task and allow hours to be
   collected. No status required back to G097 if after the DLCP process there are hours left on the oper-
   ation. If all hours are removed via the DLCP process, TAA will remove the original start and require
   a new start, logon, and logoff. TAA will pass to the DDS the "X" to identify those completed task flags
   that should be removed. TAA will add date/time stamp and sort using the date/time stamp before send-
   ing to DDS to preclude a transaction from being undeleted before it is completed. “Uncompletes” to a
   completed task will ONLY be allowed in conjunction with a reversal, nothing else.
   9.3.3. Deletions, Reversals and Co-operations for G097.
       9.3.3.1. TAA flags operations for deletion upon receipt of an “8” OP_STAT_CD from G097. TAA
       creates an error report if necessary containing JON, RCC, tail number, ITN1 and ITN2, skill code,
       work cat code, work spec code and base hours.
       9.3.3.2. “C” Operations will be accommodated in TAA. G097 will convert the status code from a
       "C" to a "0" and TAA will process as it does all other workloads.

9.4. Production Count.
   9.4.1. Production count (earned hours) is collected in DMAPS Data Store when a labor "complete"
   transaction is processed in TAA. Base hours are earned upon "complete" transactions.

     9.4.2. Planners build Labor Standards to support sub-operation level (to support production count).
     Planners compare Labor Standards structure to WCD structure to insure that production count is col-
     lected correctly. Planners may need to give special consideration regarding JOQ, Occurrence Factors,
     Natural Breakpoints, WCD Structure, and Operation/Sub-operation Structures when planning labor
     and material for DMAPS process.
     9.4.3. Batch processing for production count.
        9.4.3.1. Plan for PDMSS JOQ. Planners shall establish the labor hours based on the batch quantity
        (instead of for the typical JOQ of one) to facilitate batch processing.
        9.4.3.2. Build WCDs in G337. Planners build Labor Standards to support sub-operation level (to
        support production count). Planners compare Labor Standards structure to WCD structure to
        insure that production count is collected correctly. Planners may need to give special consideration
        regarding JOQ, Occurrence Factors, Natural Breakpoints, WCD Structure, and Operation/
        Sub-operation Structures when planning labor and material for DMAPS process.
        9.4.3.3. Plan for ITS JOQ. Planners establish the labor hours based on the batch quantity (instead
        of for the typical JOQ of one) to facilitate batch processing.

9.5. Workload Status.
     9.5.1. Process/Update Data (ITS).
        9.5.1.1. TAA to G337. TAA automatically extracts status transactions (TAA start/stop/complete)
        and generates file for ITS. ITS automatically reads (real time) and processes status transactions
        (TAA start/stop/complete) from TAA.
        9.5.1.2. ITS receives and processes data from TAA to update workload status. PDMSS provides
        data to TAA and DMAPS Data Store. ITS accepts/processes data from TAA. ITS accepts/utilizes
        TAA Employee Id's assigned all DMAG employees.
     9.5.2. TAA to G097. TAA automatically extracts status transactions (TAA start/stop/complete) and
     generates file for PDMSS. PDMSS automatically reads (real time) and processes status transactions
     (TAA start/stop/complete) from TAA.
     9.5.3. Process/Update Data (PDMSS). PDMSS receives and processes data from TAA to update
     workload status. PDMSS provides data to TAA and DMAPS Data Store. PDMSS accepts/processes
     data from TAA. PDMSS accepts/utilizes TAA Employee Id's assigned all DMAG employees.

9.6. Payroll Reconciliation.
     9.6.1. End of bi-weekly pay period, TAA sends time and attendance data to DCPS for all employees
     per pay period. End of bi-weekly pay period, payroll reconciliation data shall be passed from DCPS to
     DIFMS.
     9.6.2. Supervisors shall use TAA online Daily Labor Correction Process (DLCP) to identify errone-
     ous employee transactions (errors / authorization not made for leave or overtime).
        9.6.2.1. Supervisors use TAA online Daily Labor Correction Process (DLCP) to correct erroneous
        employee transactions. Changes may be made anytime within a pay period.
