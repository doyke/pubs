1. Official Representation Funds (ORF).
   1.1. The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized to approve the use of appropriated funds for uphold-
   ing the standing and prestige of the United States by extending official courtesies to certain officials
   and dignitaries of the United States and foreign countries. The Secretary of the Air Force may autho-
   rize the limited use of representation funds to commanders in the field for any purpose considered
   appropriate according to established Air Force and DoD policies.
      1.1.1. Only the SECAF or the CSAF may extend invitations to foreign dignitaries to visit the
      United States at the expense (cost of travel, lodging, and all others involved in getting them to a
      location) of the Department of the Air Force. MAJCOMs and below are not authorized to use ORF
      for foreign dignitary travel and lodging expenses for visits to US installations.
   1.2. Unless specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force or designee, commanders may
   spend ORFs only for official courtesies and purposes expressly authorized in this instruction.
      1.2.1. SAF/AA is responsible for reviewing requests for exceptions to this instruction. All such
      requests must be submitted through HAF/RM prior to expenditures of ORF.
   1.3. Commanders authorized ORF are referred to as designated authorities.

2. Designated Authority Responsibilities.
   2.1. Ensure courtesies are modest, not wasteful or extravagant from the perspective of the general
   public, and comply with the socially acceptable mores of American society while jointly serving the
   policy objectives of the United States and the interests of the taxpayer.
      2.1.1. Invite the minimum number of guests necessary to extend proper courtesy to the guest(s) of
      honor. When honoring guests from outside the DoD, observe the ratios in paragraph 3. of DoD to
      non-DoD attendees.
   2.2. Ensure all ORF managers and individuals involved in the planning, execution and processing of
   ORF understand and comply with this instruction; are properly trained in inventory management;
   complete government purchase card (GPC) training; and adhere to AFI 64-117 concerning GPC use
   and requirements.
   2.3. Review all events for propriety and provide written approval prior to use of ORF. Approval let-
   ters must be kept as part of the official record of the event.
   2.4. Keep records for each event documenting the following using the format prescribed in Attach-
   ment 2:
      2.4.1. Purpose of and prior-approval for the event.
      2.4.2. All DoD and non-DoD invitees with duty titles.
      2.4.3. Individual(s) being hosted.
      2.4.4. Total cost.
      2.4.5. Any personnel invited but not paid for with ORF.
      2.4.6. Location and date of the event.
   2.5. Designated authorities with joint or unified command responsibility may not use funds provided
   by the Secretary of the Air Force to host events in their joint or unified capacity. Reference CJCSI
4                                                     AFI65-603_AFRCSUP1_I 28 FEBRUARY 2006


    7201.01A, Combatant Commanders’ Official Representation Funds, for guidance regarding events of
    this type.
    2.6. Designated authorities may delegate hosting responsibilities in instances when they, as autho-
    rized hosts, are unavailable. The delegated authority must be in writing, result from extenuating cir-
    cumstances, and should normally be made to the next highest ranking individual in the organizational
    chain of command.
       2.6.1. (Added-AFRC) HQ USAF/RE, HQ AFRC/CV, HQ ARPC/CC, NAF/CC, and WG/CC are
       AFRC ORF designated authorities. If under extenuating circumstances, the designated authority
       cannot host an ORF-funded event, the above commanders must delegate the authority, in writing,
       to the next individual in the chain of command.

3. ORF Ratios.
    3.1. When providing modest courtesies using ORF, ensure attendance follows these ratios:
       3.1.1. Parties of less than 30 persons--not more than 80 percent will be DoD personnel.
       3.1.2. Parties of 30 or more persons--not more than 50 percent will be DoD personnel.
    3.2. Foreign military personnel assigned to the host activity or who are assigned to an organization
    which operates as a subordinate part of a United States Command are counted as DoD personnel for
    ratio-computing purposes.
NOTE: DoD personnel are active duty military and civilian employees of DoD and the Coast Guard; stu-
dents of the military academies; reservists on active duty; members of the National Guard; former military
and civilian employees of DoD not holding a position of prominence in the non-DoD community; and
spouses of those in the preceeding categories. Former DoD military and civilian personnel who held the
rank of 4-star general, or equivalent, are considered prominent U.S. citizens and should be counted as
non-DoD, as well as their spouse.
    3.3. The practice of inviting unnecessary personnel to meet an exact ratio is specifically prohibited.
    3.4. DoD personnel in excess of the ratios may attend functions by paying the pro rata share of the
    total expense.
       3.4.1. Pro rata expenses are determined by dividing the entire cost of the event by the number of
       attendees. All attendees, above the authorized ratios or who do not meet the intent for using ORF,
       must pay the pro rata costs when attending events.
       Example 1) An official guest list contains 50 personnel requiring a 50% ratio. 10 personnel are
       authorized guests. Applying the 1 to 1 ratio only 10 DoD personnel may be properly funded with
       ORF. These 20 people (10 authorized and 10 DoD) comprise 40% of the total guest list and, there-
       fore, ORF may cover 40% of the total cost of the function. The remaining 60% of the cost must be
       paid either on a pro rata basis by the additional 30 DoD persons or divided among all DoD attend-
       ees.
       Example 2) An official guest list contains 25 people requiring a 20% ratio. 3 personnel on the list
       are authorized guests. Applying the 1 to 4 ratio only 12 DoD personnel may also be properly
       funded with ORF. These 15 people (3 authorized and 12 DoD) comprise 60% of the total guest list
       and, therefore, ORF may cover 60% of the total cost of the function. The remaining 40% must be
AFI65-603_AFRCSUP1_I 28 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                     5


       paid either on a pro rata basis by the additional 10 DoD personnel or divided among all DoD
       attendees.
       3.4.2. (Added-AFRC) All AFRC-assigned personnel, and spouses, will use personal funds to
       attend/participate in commander-hosted ORF events.
   3.5. Deviations from the maximum number of DoD participants paid from ORF is not authorized
   without the advance approval of SAF/AA.
NOTE: When an event’s actual attendee deviation is more than 5%, all documentation concerning the
event and an explanation of the deviation must be forwarded through the MAJCOM to SAF/AA for
review.

4. Authorized Categories.
   4.1. For purposes of this instruction, the term ‘official courtesies’ includes:
       4.1.1. Community Relations. Entertainment of individuals specified in paragraph 5.2. to maintain
       civic standing.
       4.1.2. International Relations. Entertainment in honor of visiting distinguished foreign nationals
       as specified in paragraph 5.1.
       4.1.3. Public Relations. Entertainment for a visiting distinguished American citizen as specified
       in paragraph 5.3.
       4.1.4. DoD Protocol. Entertainment incidental to a visit by DoD personnel as specified in para-
       graph 5.4.
       4.1.5. Other Expenditures. Mementos and non-perishables such as packaged food items, alcohol,
       disposable serving items, and refreshments, to include coffee, tea and associated condiments pur-
       chased for approved events not covered in above categories.
          4.1.5.1. Place all such items into inventory and strictly control and document use.

5. Individuals On Whom ORF May Be Expended.
   5.1. Distinguished citizens, military personnel and government officials of foreign countries whose
   rank, position, function or stature clearly justify use of these funds.
   5.2. U.S. Federal, state, county and local officials, such as the President and the Vice President of the
   U.S.; members of the Cabinet; members and professional staff personnel of Congress; other U.S. Gov-
   ernment officials (non-DoD) comparable to those DoD officials listed in paragraph 5.4.
   5.3. Prominent U.S. citizens, whose rank, position, function or stature warrant the extension of offi-
   cial courtesies by the U.S. Government. This includes those in leadership positions who significantly
   impact local support (for example, members of the Board of Directors) of citizens' committees, such
   as the local Chamber of Commerce.
NOTE: Former DoD members, military or civilian, who held the rank, or a position equivalent, of Gen-
eral are the only former DoD members authorized to be hosted with ORF unless they now hold a position
of prominence in the non-DoD community eligible for the use of ORF as outlined in this instruction.
       5.3.1. (Added-AFRC) Civilian (non-DoD) employers of Reservists, whose support makes it pos-
       sible for Reservists to honor their Reserve obligations.
6                                                      AFI65-603_AFRCSUP1_I 28 FEBRUARY 2006


       5.3.2. (Added-AFRC) Elected officials, community leaders, key educators, clergy members, and
       non-DOD civilian employers of reservists, etc., and their spouses, attending a commander-hosted
       community relations event qualify for ORF expenditures as non-DOD guests. All other DOD per-
       sonnel (civilian, active duty, reserve forces and retired military members and their spouses),
       except those listed in Para 5.4., must use personal funds to attend/participate. They must be
       assessed a pro rata cost.
    5.4. Select senior DoD personnel while on official visits to the field. Events should be the minimal
    required courtesies (small, modest functions) where attendance is strictly limited to only the necessary

    graph 3.
AFI65-603_AFRCSUP1_I 28 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                   7


      5.5.1. DoD spouses may be included in the official party at such events when spouses of autho-
      rized guests are invited and expected to attend, and the authorized host determines that attendance
      of DoD spouses is appropriate and desirable under the circumstances.
          5.5.1.1. Do not authorize separate events for spouses of visiting officials unless specifically
          related to the official purpose of the visit.
      5.5.2. The use of ORF for support personnel traveling with eligible senior DoD member or for
      support personnel from the hosting official’s organization (i.e., executive officers, aides-de-camp,
      protocol staff, transportation drivers, personal security team members) is expressly forbidden.

6. Presenting Mementos and Gifts.

      of command.
      6.1.3. (Added-AFRC) ORF-purchased mementos may be presented to non-DOD guests.
      Mementos may be presented to the senior non-DoD guest as a remembrance of an official event.
      Examples include, but are not limited to plaques, aircraft models, and framed aircraft paintings/
      lithographs, etc. Mementos should be purchased as part of the official event. However, nominal
      valued mementos may be purchased in bulk for future planned events (i.e. annual employer day).
      Examples include, but are not limited to, a coin or cap with unit or command crest or a photo of
      the non-DOD group participating in an official commander-hosted community relations event
      such as a civic leader flight, employer day, etc.) Mementos must not exceed the monetary limits

10. Maintaining Inventories.

          copy of the inventory log, signed by the auditor, must be forwarded to HQ AFRC/PAC by
          COB 30 Sep each year. The auditor reconciles the beginning inventory, purchases and items
          presented, to the inventory on hand. A report of findings is submitted to the designated funds
          approval official (HQ AFRC/PA) and a report filed with inventory records for audit purposes

          recipient, date and location of presentation, who made the presentation, and items presented.
          All mementos must be secured.

      10.4.2. End-of-year purchasing is highly discouraged, as it creates inappropriate excess inven-
      tory.
   10.5. Disposal of items from ORF inventories due to damage or extenuating circumstance should be
   in accordance with local supply procedures to ensure proper turn-in to the Defense Reutilization and
   Marketing Office (DRMO) or otherwise authorized disposal.

            funds.”

            TURE) AFRC commanders must submit a Summary of ORF Expenditure to their Unit Finan-
            cial Services Officer (FSO) and a copy to HQ AFRC/PAC within 10 work days after the event/
