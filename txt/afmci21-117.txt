1. General. A relationship exists between preventing and controlling corrosion on aerospace
systems, equipment, and components. Corrosion will decrease if corrosion prevention efforts are
increased. At the field level, the best and most economical means to corrosion prevention is
frequent cleaning in conjunction with periodic maintenance touch-up painting and frequent
corrosion inspections. Prevention is the key to an effective corrosion control program; therefore,
strict adherence to corrosion prevention polices is essential. USAF technical instructions for
corrosion prevention, detection, treatment, and protection furnish general guidance concerning
application of the AFMC Corrosion Prevention and Control Program. The applicable USAF or
commercial weapon system equipment manuals include inspection frequencies and maintenance
requirements of specific weapons systems and equipment. Apply paint schemes/configuration
and USAF standard aircraft markings according to T.O. 1-1-8 and applicable weapon system
T.O.s. There is no authorization to deviate from the requirements of this instruction without
prior approval of HQ AFMC/A4M.
     1.1. The Air Logistics Complexes (ALC) and other AFMC maintenance activities will
     implement this instruction as written. Waivers for deviation to this instruction will be
     submitted to HQ AFMC/A4M for review and approval/disapproval for any
     responsibilities/functions deemed not applicable. (T-2)

   4.2. ASM personnel will assist the owning activities in their corrosion prevention efforts by
   accomplishing scheduled corrosion inspections on aircraft, support and test equipment if
   required. (T-2)
   4.3. Owning activities personnel shall perform aircraft corrosion inspection work cards
   specified in the -6 T.O. ASM personnel will assist when needed. All maintenance
   personnel, regardless of Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), shall examine each part removed
   and inspect the inside of all exposed areas for corrosion. Avionics maintenance personnel
   shall inspect the electrical connectors of avionics line replaceable units (LRUs), inside
   equipment drawers, and so forth, for corrosion. All deficiencies noted during these
   inspections will be entered in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781A. When corrosion
   discrepancies are discovered that may affect aircraft structural integrity or safety of
   flight/operation or are beyond the using organization’s capability to evaluate and repair, an
   ASM specialist will be requested. (T-2)
   4.4. Maintenance personnel who remove/install aircraft panels and doors must ensure seals
   are serviceable and sealant is applied to panels and fasteners as specified in applicable
   aircraft technical orders. (T-2)
   4.5. Maintenance personnel shall report all corrosion deficiencies through the MIS IAW 00-
   20 series technical orders or depot equivalent. Accurate documentation of maintenance
   actions in support of the Corrosion Control and Prevention Program is essential to support
   future manning, equipment requirements, training and parts/material procurement
   requirements. (T-2)
5. Aerospace Vehicles Marking Requirements. This section provides guidance for applying
command approved non-USAF standard aircraft markings as authorized in T.O. 1-1-8. Paint
schemes/configurations and USAF standard aircraft markings will be applied in accordance with
AFMCI21-117 28 MAY 2014                                                                        11


T.O. 1-1-8 and the applicable aircraft technical order. Aircraft markings will be applied to
aircraft as specifically authorized by HQ AFMC/A4M, this instruction, T.O. 1-1-8, or the
applicable aircraft technical order. Low observable aircraft markings not currently approved
require a waiver due to strict survivability analysis requirements; route the waiver request
through AFMC/A4M. Aircraft inputs to depot will be marked IAW Air Force directives and this
instruction only, unless otherwise approved by HQ AFMC/A4M. HQ AFMC/A4M is the point
of contact for aircraft painting and markings, to include all unit designation markings. (T-2)
   5.1. Aircraft markings. All aircraft markings and basic paint schemes will be maintained
   intact, legible and distinct in color. Command standardization of markings by mission design
   series (MDS) is of primary concern. Fighter/Trainer units should plan to scuff sand and
   overcoat their aircraft exterior finish every four to six years to maintain the coating system
   integrity and aircraft appearance. However, the coating system may experience premature
   failure or exceed the four to six year life expectancy. The four to six year overcoat is the
   approximate mid-life expectancy of present coating systems qualified for aircraft application.
   Scuff sand and overcoat of the aircraft exterior should be performed at intervals such that the
   total mil thickness of the finish system does not exceed 18 mils prior to an authorized strip
   and recoat. Aircraft exterior finished shall not exceed more than two full scuff and overcoats
   before strip and recoat. All aircraft coatings will be evaluated/rated every 6 months for
   appearance/coating system integrity using applicable technical data or a locally developed
   system. The aircraft must be washed and clean prior to paint scoring. Supervisors will use
   ratings to determine corrosion treatment/paint scheduling priority. Units are required to
   adopt maintenance painting techniques (i.e., spot painting and sectionalized painting as stated
   in T.O. 1-1-8) to maintain aircraft corrosion protection and appearance between overcoats.
   Partial painting “sections” of the aircraft will help reduce the effects of mottling and
   mismatch. Units should rotate Commander’s aircraft to prevent excessive paint build-up
   from too frequent overcoating. Fully overcoated aircraft will be documented in MIS and the
   individual aircraft AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data, for tracking purposes. Units
   with large aircraft should rely on spot maintenance painting and sectionalized painting
   between depot cycles to maintain the coating system integrity. (T-2)
       5.1.1. Do not apply aircraft markings to aircraft unless specifically authorized by this
       directive, T.O. 1-1-8, aircraft drawings, or the applicable aircraft T.O. HQ AFMC/A4M
       is the point of contact for aircraft painting and markings. (T-2)
       5.1.2. Aircraft assigned to AFMC but possessed by other units, such as Air Warfare
       Center aircraft, will not have AFMC markings. (T-2)
       5.1.3. All newly assigned aircraft in AFMC will be in compliance with this instruction
       within 90 days after arrival. (T-2)
       5.1.4. Conspicuity Markings. Test and test support aircraft may use these markings.
       AFMC field commanders have the authority to select aircraft for this type of marking
       scheme. Selection must be based on mission essentiality and conform to T.O. 1-1-8.
       Waivers will be submitted to HQ AFMC/A4M IAW T.O. 1-1-8. (T-2)
   5.2. Silk-Screen Printing. The silk-screen printing process is an approved method for
   applying insignia to aircraft. (T-2)
12                                                                AFMCI21-117 28 MAY 2014


     5.2.1. The silk-screen print method will not be used on aircraft surfaces that are
     contoured or have protruding screws, rivets, or bolts making use of rigid silk-screen
     frames impossible. (T-2)
     5.2.2. When used, silk-screen printing kits will be procured using local purchase
     procedures with operations and maintenance (O&M) funds. Vendors can be identified by
     local contracting offices. (T-2)
  5.3. Stenciling. Markings may be applied using stencils. Refer to T.O. 1-1-8 to determine
  the compatibility of stenciling paints and paint finishes. (T-2)
  5.4. Command Insignia. The application of the command insignia on aircraft is mandatory.
  The insignia will be applied to both sides of the vertical stabilizer unless otherwise specified.
  Size, color and location of command insignias by MDS are specified in Attachment 2.
  NOTE: Aircraft with LO coatings to include F-16 aircraft with Uniform Have Glass (UHG),
  will use subdued insignias in contrasting shade of gray. (T-2)
  5.5. Organizational Insignia. The application of wing insignia is mandatory. The insignia
  will be applied to both sides of the forward fuselage. The operational squadron insignia may
  be applied on the left side in place of the wing insignia. Size, color and location of
  organizational insignias by MDS are specified in Attachment 2. NOTE: Aircraft with LO
  coatings to include F-16 aircraft with UHG, will use subdued insignias in contrasting shade
  of gray. (T-2)
  5.6. Distinctive Unit Aircraft Identification Marking. The application of the unit designator
  is mandatory for all AFMC aircraft unless otherwise directed. HQ AFMC/A4M is the OPR
  for the assignment of unit designators. T.O. 1-1-8 or the applicable aircraft T.O. will provide
  color restrictions for the unit designator. The unit designator will be applied in accordance
  with guidelines in Attachment 2 of this instruction. (T-2)
  5.7. Tail Stripe. Each flying unit will have a tail stripe unique to the unit. The use of the
  same tail stripe by two or more units within a wing is not permitted. The Wing Commander
  may include colors from all flying units. The tail stripe will be applied at the upper portion
  of the vertical stabilizer, and must be in the form of a straight stripe. The width will not
  exceed 6 inches on fighter type aircraft and 28 inches on large aircraft. The stripe may be
  any color or pattern, and may contain a logo. On aircraft bearing the American Flag the tail
  stripe must be solid in color and will not contain any logo, name, or lettering. On aircraft
  with multiple vertical stabilizers, the tail stripe may be of either a wrap-around style on both
  vertical stabilizers or applied to the outboard sides of each vertical stabilizer. (T-2)
  5.8. Aircrew And Crew Chief Names. Aircrew and crew chief/assistant names may be
  applied to all command aircraft, but must be removed prior to deployment where they may be
  subject to enter a combat zone. Application of nicknames, punctuation, and/or call signs is
  not permitted. The style and size of letters for each MDS aircraft are identified in
  Attachment 2. Any style and size letter not identified for a particular MDS aircraft in
  Attachment 2 will be considered a unit option, but will not exceed 3 inches in height. Each
  MDS aircraft in the wing will be standardized with the exception of the designated
  Commander's aircraft. The Commander’s aircraft may have different lettering, but will not
  exceed 3 inches in height. A background block for pilot/crew chief names may be used. The
  block should be in contrasting color to the section of the aircraft where applied. To further
AFMCI21-117 28 MAY 2014                                                                      13


  an MDS theme, the block may be preceded by a design depicting the MDS; i.e., F-15 eagle
  head, F-16 falcon head, etc. The name block should give a subdued appearance and may be
  other than rectangular in shape. Names will contain military rank/civilian (Mr. or Ms.), first
  name, initial, and last name. (T-2)
  5.9. Commander's Aircraft Markings. Commander's aircraft referred to in this instruction
  are those designated as Test Center, Test Wing, Operations Group (OG) and Operations
  Squadron Commander's aircraft. The Test Center Commander may select one Wing within
  the command to have an aircraft specifically marked. It will be the only aircraft authorized
  so marked. Wing, OG, and Operations Squadron Commanders are authorized only one
  aircraft each to be marked with standardized commander type markings. The following are
  markings authorized for use on Commander’s aircraft: (T-2)
     5.9.1. Wing and/or Test Center insignias on the right forward fuselage and a collage of
     assigned flight/operations squadron insignias on the left forward fuselage. (T-2)
     5.9.2. Highlighting of unit designator and tail number. All highlighting will be done in a
     contrasting gray, black, or white as long as it meets primary basecoat gloss requirements
     e.g. gloss, camouflage or gunship. With exception of the B-2 aircraft, all unit designators
     and radio call numbers will remain on vertical stabilizers as depicted in applicable
     technical orders. Variations may be approved for Commanders aircraft when required
     with approval from HQ AFMC/A4M. (T-2)
     5.9.3. Unit unique markings. This policy is provided to allow latitude for application of
     anniversary logo markings to Wing Commander aircraft. When applied, anniversary
     markings will not interfere with required aircraft markings and must be removed
     immediately after the anniversary period (1-year maximum). Waivers are not required
     for unit unique markings, however, Wing Commanders must approve the markings, and
     photographs must be provided to HQ AFMC/A4M for review and file. State flags and
     logos, other than anniversary type, are not considered unit unique markings. AFMC/CC
     has designated HQ AFMC/PA as the clearinghouse for all requests to name AFMC
     aircraft. This includes markings previously considered unit unique and are community
     related/appreciation types such as “Spirit of,” “City of,” “State of.” Naming aircraft is a
     tradition designed to commemorate or honor individuals, geographic locations, or events
     either for the support provided the Air Force on a long-term basis, or because of its
     significance to Air Force history or heritage. Recommendations must include a proposed
     name, suggested aircraft and tail number, and detailed justification for the proposed
     name. Contact the wing Public Affairs office for details. (T-2)
  5.10. Aircraft Travel Pods. Travels pods for aircraft painted in camouflage paint schemes
  may be painted with the same color and type of paint as the aircraft and have no additional
  markings. Units with multicolor aircraft should select one primary color of the aircraft for
  the travel pod. Travel pods designated for Commander’s aircraft may be any color, but must
  complement the overall paint scheme of the aircraft and present a professional appearance.
  These travel pods may contain the name, position, and appropriate rank insignia of the
  individual. Lettering may be of any color and style, but shall not exceed 6 inches in height.
  (T-2)
  5.11. External Fuel Tanks. External fuel tanks shall be painted the same color and tone as
  existing aircraft coating. Squadron designator and tank serial number shall be applied with
14                                                               AFMCI21-117 28 MAY 2014


  contrasting colors to ensure accurate tracking of fuel tanks (see Attachment 2 for marking
  instructions). (T-2)
  5.12. Paint Identification Placard. The paint identification block is a mandatory marking
  specified in T.O. 1-1-8. The block may be of a unique design, i.e., eagle head, falcon head,
  or state outline but must not exceed 6 inches by 6 inches in size and will match the color of
  other markings on the aircraft. Waiver requests are not required for this item, however, Wing
  Commander approval is required and photographs of the design must be provided to HQ
  AFMC/A4M for review and file. (T-2)
  5.13. Nose Numbers. Aircraft nose numbers shall be in block or Helvetica letters, not to
  exceed four digits. Specific location and size for each different type aircraft is contained in
  Attachment 2. The paint material(s) used to apply nose numbers shall have the same gloss
  requirement as the base aircraft coating. (T-2)
  5.14. Bird Of Prey Silhouette. Bird of prey silhouettes are authorized on F-15 and F-16
  aircraft as a unit option but must be standardized within a wing by MDS. No waiver is
  required to apply bird of prey silhouettes but a photograph must be submitted to HQ
  AFMC/A4M for review and file. The following guidelines apply: (T-2)
     5.14.1. F-15 Aircraft. The silhouette will be placed on the insides of the vertical
     stabilizers. They will not exceed 24 inches in height and must be applied in a contrasting
     gray color. (T-2)
     5.14.2. F-16 Aircraft. The silhouette can be placed anywhere on the aircraft as long as it
     does not interfere with standard required markings. The silhouette will not exceed 18
     inches in height and must be applied in a contrasting gray color. (T-2)
  5.15. Gun Ports. Gun ports will be painted in flat black paint. (T-2)
  5.16. Nose Art. For purposes of clarification, “nose art” shall be the term used to identify
  specialized artwork applied to any area of the aircraft. Nose art is authorized under the
  following guidelines: (T-2)

     5.16.2. Be distinctive, symbolic and designed in good taste. (T-2)
     5.16.3. Enhance unit pride. (T-2)
     5.16.4. Be gender neutral. (T-2)
     5.16.5. Match gloss requirements of the basic paint scheme, i.e., aircraft with flat
     camouflage schemes require application of nose art in flat colors. (T-2)
     5.16.6. All designs will be reviewed by the base Judge Advocate (JA) and Social Actions
     office for legal, discriminatory, and copyright issues. In addition, designs will not be
     used to endorse any unofficial organization or activity. Final approval for nose art
     applied to aircraft rests with the Wing Commander. Photographs of all approved designs
     will be submitted to HQ AFMC/A4M for review and file. World War II nose art that
     meets the above criteria may be used. Cartoon-type characters may be used; however,
     the unit will be responsible for all copyright issues. Removal of nose art prior to
     deployment will be at the discretion of the WG/CC. (T-2)
AFMCI21-117 28 MAY 2014                                                                      15

 16                                                                AFMCI21-117 28 MAY 2014


       5.21.1. Units shall provide 8” x 10” color photographs of unique markings for all local
       option changes authorized by this instruction (i.e., tail stripe/name block design and/or
       color changes, paint data placard, bird of prey silhouettes, nose art, etc.) to HQ
       AFMC/A4M for review and file. (T-2)
   5.22. Test Equipment/Consolidated Tool Kits (CTK). Tone down of test equipment, CTKs
   and like equipment will be determined by the aircraft gloss requirement, i.e., unit with
   aircraft having gloss finishes may apply gloss finishes to their test equipment and CTKs. If
   the aircraft assigned have a requirement for flat finishes, then all test equipment and CTKs
   designed for on-equipment application will be toned down in flat colors. (T-2)
       5.22.1. To prevent obscuring of instructions and possible damage to components, only
       exteriors of test equipment boxes will be toned down. (T-2)
       5.22.2. Flight line test equipment and CTKs used to support mobility/contingency
       requirements will be toned down (i.e., gray, olive drab, brown, black or forest green). A
       camouflage pattern incorporating a combination of these colors may be used. (T-2)
       5.22.3. Equipment not removed from back shops do not need to be toned down (i.e., test
       equipment, test benches, and mockups). (T-2)
