                                            Chapter 1

                     ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICAL ACTIVITIES

1.1. Scope of SOF Medical Care. This instruction defines the roles and responsibilities of
AFSOC Health Care Providers (HCPs), Nurses, Independent Duty Medical Technicians/National
Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians-Paramedics (IDMT/NREMT-P), Cardiopulmonary
and Surgical Technicians regarding scope of medical care while deployed with special operations
forces (SOF). This document also defines tasks and responsibilities that prepare AFSOC HCPs
and IDMT/NREMT-Ps to properly execute mission requirements. HCPs are defined as
Physicians, Physician Assistants (PAs), Nurse Practitioners (NPs), and Certified Registered
Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). Credentialing, privileging, and quality assurance for in-garrison
care remains the responsibility of the host Military Treatment Facility (MTF) in accordance with
Air Force Instruction (AFI) 44-119, Medical Quality Operations. This instruction also defines
the medically related roles and responsibilities of AFSOC PJs who are primarily rescue
specialists, but who provide Emergency Medical Technician-Paramedic (EMT-P) level
emergency medical care.
1.2. Scope of Care Documentation. All HCPs will maintain a current copy of their Inter-
facility Credentials Transfer Brief (ICTB) in their deployment folder. (T-3). Likewise,
IDMT/NREMT-Ps will maintain a copy of their current initial and sustainment training
documentation in their 6-part competency assessment folder and via the electronic Air Force
Training Record (AFTR). (T-2). All IDMT/NREMT-Ps will hand carry these documents while
deployed. If deployed to a location with medical facilities (MTF, Expeditionary Medical Support
(EMEDS), Combat Support Hospital (CSH), etc.) HCPs and IDMT/NREMT-Ps will provide the
medical facility commander with a copy of these documents to allow the IDMT/NREMT-P to
work within his/her scope of practice. While deployed with SOF, AFSOC operational medics
assigned to line units (such as Operational Support Medical (OSM), Special Tactics Squadron
(STS), SOF aviation advisory medical personnel) remain within the special operations chain of
command. However, AFSOC medical personnel will comply with co-located medical facility
credentialing/privileging processes. HCPs and IDMT/NREMT-Ps will ensure the senior AFSOC
physician at the deployed location reviews ICTBs and IDMT/ NREMT-P certification
documents. HCPs and IDMT/NREMT-Ps will practice within their respective scope of care (as
documented by credentialing and privileging documentation) at all times.
1.3. Aeromedical Disposition.
   1.3.1. All HCPs and IDMT/NREMT-Ps may place an aircrew member in Duties Not
   Including Flying (DNIF) status or special operational duty personnel in Duties Not Including
   Controlling (DNIC) status.
   1.3.2. Only a credentialed United States (US) military flight surgeon may determine if
   aircrew personnel are fit to return to flying status or special operational duty personnel are fit
   to return to special operational duty (controller duty, parachute duty). A Flight Surgeon (FS)
   or a Diving Medical Officers (DMO) may return a diver to duty.
       1.3.2.1. In contingencies when no US military FS is present, all other providers or
       IDMT/NREMT-Ps must contact a US military FS for appropriate aeromedical
       disposition. This contact must be documented in the aviator’s or special tactics team
6                                                     AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


       member’s medical record and subsequently countersigned by the consulted FS or a home
       station FS upon return from deployment.
       1.3.2.2. Any United States Air Force (USAF) or US Department of Defense (DOD) FS
       may be used as an aeromedical consultant. Non-US FS will not be used as consultants
       for aeromedical dispositions.
       1.3.2.3. In circumstances where no FS is present, and there is loss of communication
       capability that precludes contacting a US military FS, the non-flight surgeon provider
       will discuss the aviator’s or special tactics team member’s medical condition with the
       deployed line commander for disposition. A FS will be consulted as soon as
       communication capability is restored.
       1.3.2.4. AF Form 1041, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational
       Duty Log Review. All AFSOC FS (not deployed, TDY, in mandatory training, on post-
       deployment compensation time off, or on leave) must attend and participate in the weekly
       AF Form 1041 meeting, and the waiver review meeting, at the host Military Treatment
       Facility (MTF). All AFSOC FS need to be aware of current information and updates
       regarding grounded AFSOC personnel and AFSOC waiver status. (T-1).
1.4. Dive Medicine. PJs and Combat Controllers are combat swimmers (military divers). AFI
10-3501, Air Force Diving Program, governs special tactics diving.
1.5. Directed Energy. Suspected or confirmed directed energy (laser) exposure events will be
managed, and patients will be treated IAW AFSOCI 48-1391, Laser Radiation Protection
Program.
1.6. Infection Control Responsibilities.
    1.6.1. IAW AFI 44-108, Infection Control Program, paragraph 1.6., the host MTF
    Commander establishes an Infection Control Committee (ICC) and appoints a provider to
    chair the ICC. The Chief, Medical Staff (SGH) maintains overall responsibility for the
    Infection Control Program (ICP).
    1.6.2. The Operational Medical Support Flight (OSM) flight commander will ensure the
    deployed medical officer-in-charge implements an active and current ICP at all locations
    where OSM medical personnel deliver medical care.

   Oct 2001, and 20 Mar 2003, available at AFMS Knowledge Exchange - Aerospace Medicine
8                                                      AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


    - No Go Pill Policies or https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/file/web/ctb_018350.pdf. The
    current official Air Force approved aircrew medications document must also be reviewed to
    ensure compliance with current policy. Ground testing must be completed prior to use in
    accordance with the previous messages.
       1.7.3.1. HQ AFSOC/SG delegates approval authority for operational use of―No Go
       Pills to flight surgeons at the operational unit level; however, authority delegation is
       contingent upon strict compliance with all program requirements and documentation
       requirements. Delegation is granted for aircrew and ground-based crew sleep-aid for
       specific operations or mission profiles in conjunction with fatigue countermeasure
       techniques highlighted in Combat Air Force (CAF) Fatigue Counter Measures Program
       or as outlined below. The senior flight surgeon at the unit level is responsible for
       implementation of this policy. (T-2).
       1.7.3.2. Hypnotics are authorized at the time of deployment or redeployment to
       synchronize circadian rhythm in the deploying or redeploying crews. Hypnotics are also
       authorized to assist deployed individual crew members with management of fatigue and
       circadian rhythm problems. This assistance may be used during the pre- or post- flight
       mission period. The member is limited verbally to not flying within 12 hours after taking
       Temazepam (Restoril), 6 hours after taking Zolpidem (Ambien), or 4 hours after taking
       Zaleplon (Sonata) in accordance with the Official Air Force Aircrew Medications list.
       1.7.3.3. This policy for use of hypnotic medication also applies to AFSOC PJs, Combat
       Controllers, Combat Weathermen and AFSOC assigned Tactical Air Control-Party
       (TAC-Ps). The use of hypnotics is authorized prior to, or after, the completion of the
       following ground operations: terminal control, reconnaissance, and recovery operations
       in austere environments. The member is verbally limited to no controlling or special
       operational duty within the same time limits that apply for flying.
    1.7.4. Operational Use of Fatigue Management Medication (“Go Pills”): The approval
    authority for the operational use of fatigue management medication by special operations
    ground combat personnel is a Special Operations Wing (SOW), Special Operations Group
    (SOG), Special Tactical Group (STG), or Special Operations Air Component Commander, in
    accordance with (IAW)Vice Commander (CV) policy memorandum dated 22 March 2010.
    Only AFSOC Special Tactics personnel (Combat Rescue Officers (CROs), Para-
    Jumper/Pararescueman (PJs), Combat Controllers, Combat Weathermen and AFSOC
    assigned TAC-Ps) are authorized to use Modafinil as a “Go Pill” during ground operations
    requiring extended wakefulness after all other fatigue countermeasures have been
    implemented. Approval of distribution and use of fatigue management medication is
    contingent on compliance with all procedures contained within this instruction. Use is not
    approved for parachute or diving operations. The use of Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine®)
    is no longer authorized.
       1.7.4.1. Modafinil use is only permitted after all other non-pharmacologic fatigue
       countermeasures have been attempted and exhausted. Prior to a commander signing the
       approval form, a FS must review and verify that each individual has been ground tested,
       medically cleared to use modafinil and that all documentation is posted to the medical
       record. Once the aforementioned requirements have been verified the FS will sign a
       document that will deploy with a medical representative (see Attachment 2 AFSOC
AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                9


     SPECIAL TACTICS MODAFINIL AUTHORIZATION FOR USE SAMPLE).
     Individuals who do not meet testing or documentation requirements will have a line
     drawn through their name and will not be authorized the medication. The authorization
     form will be used; however, approval may also be documented by email message or other
     written format, but a flight surgeon must have reviewed and concurred with each
     individual. AFSOC FS will ensure commanders and ground combat personnel are aware
     of optimal fatigue countermeasure strategies.          The commander’s approval of
     pharmacologic fatigue countermeasures may be for a specific mission or for a specific
     period of deployment. A copy of the written approval will be forwarded to HQ
     AFSOC/SGP and a copy will be maintained by the ground combat operator’s home
     station STS for a minimum of 3 years. The operator who obtains or uses Modafinil has
     the ultimate responsibility to ensure a copy of the written approval is submitted to their
     special tactics squadron.
     1.7.4.2. Prior ground testing, counseling, and informed consent must all be accomplished
     and documented prior to dispensing Modafinil, and operational use will be appropriately
     documented and reported. The USAF/SG, 31 Aug 06, Updated Modafinil Policy
     memorandum explicitly outlines the process for use of these medications. All required
     forms attached to the policy memorandum will be followed with the exception of the
     approval form (Attachment 2). Note: No other AFSOC aircrew or special operations
     personnel are authorized use of Modafinil or “Go Pills.”
     1.7.4.3. After the appropriate commander approves the use of Modafinil for operational
     fatigue management, a flight surgeon will prescribe the appropriate quantity of
     medication for the mission or deployment. The prescription will be documented in the
     member’s medical record.
     1.7.4.4. The recommended dosage of Modafinil for operational fatigue management is
     200 mg every 8 hours as needed for sustained wakefulness. Modafinil usage should not
     exceed a dosage of 400 mg in any 24-hour period. Maximum approved dispensing
     quantity is twelve 200 mg tablets for each 30 days of deployment. The use of Modafinil
     for fatigue management should be limited to the fewest number of doses required to
     effectively complete a mission. The maximum approved period of continuous
     operational use of Modafinil is 72 hours.
     1.7.4.5. Ground combat personnel who use Modafinil during any mission will report use
     of the medication and the number of tablets via the mission report submitted at the end of
     each mission. Additionally, at the end of each deployment, ground combat personnel
     who obtained Modafinil will report the number of tablets of medication used during the
     deployment to 720 STG/SG and HQ AFSOC/SGP using the End of Operation Report
     form in the USAF/SG, 31 Aug 06, memorandum on Modafinil use. The flying-oriented
     form may be adapted as needed for ground operations reporting. All unused medication
     will be returned to the dispensing unit. Any loss of medication or other medication
     discrepancy will be reported by the operator to the squadron commander and HQ
     AFSOC/SGP.
     1.7.4.6. AFSOC ground combat personnel who have received informed consent, have
     successfully completed ground testing, and are attached to United States Army Special
     Operations Command (USASOC), United States Marine Corps Forces Special

        Operations Command (MARSOC) or Naval Special Warfare forces may obtain
        Modafinil from those United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)
        components. In that circumstance, AFSOC personnel will follow distribution and
        reporting procedures established by those components. Other theater specific policies
        may also regulate the use of these medications within the area of responsibilities (AORs).
        However, reporting the use must still be in compliance with this instruction.
        1.7.4.7. Any adverse health effect associated with the use of Modafinil and any adverse
        incident that occurs while ground combat personnel are using fatigue management
        medication must be reported as soon as practical to the respective Special Operations Air
        Component Commander, the operator’s special tactics unit commander, HQ AFSOC/A3,
        and HQ AFSOC/SGP. The Unexpected Occurrence form in the USAF/SG, 31 Aug 06,
        memorandum will be used and submitted to HQ AFSOC/SGP if any adverse health
        effects occur.
        1.7.4.8. The 720 STG/SG will accomplish a 100% semiannual self-inspection of this
        program in February and August of each year for compliance with this instruction.
        Results will be forwarded to the 720 STG/CC, HQ AFSOC/SG and AFSOC/CV. HQ
        AFSOC/SGP will conduct an annual audit of the fatigue countermeasures program.
1.8. Quality Assurance (QA). The senior AFSOC physician assigned to each deployed unit is
responsible for that unit’s quality assurance program. The senior deployed AFSOC physician is
responsible for medical quality assurance during deployments. Quality assurance will include
chart reviews of 5% of patient encounters for HCPs (if less than 10 patient encounters occur per
month during the deployment, then 100% chart review is required) and 100% review for
IDMT/NREMT-P patient encounters. Physician chart peer reviews will be accomplished by
AFSOC physicians who are credentialed in the same Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) as the
peer reviewed physician. Physician Assistant (PA) quality assurance reviews will be completed
by the IDMT/NREMT-P physician preceptor. IDMT/NREMT-P quality assurance will be
completed IAW AFI 44-103, The Air Force Independent Duty Medical Technician Program. (T-
2).
     1.8.1. QA must be accomplished quarterly. If for operational reasons, quality review cannot
     be completed within 30 days of after quarter end, send request for wavier to HQ
     AFSOC/SGPO via Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) or Secure Terminal
     Equipment (STE).
     1.8.2. After return from deployment, a copy of all chart review documentation (See
     Attachment 3 DEPLOYED QA OVERSIGHT DOCUMENTATION SAMPLE) will be
     forwarded to HQ AFSOC/SGPO. Copies of documentation of chart reviews will also be
     forwarded to the host MTF for continued credentialing/privileging actions.
     1.8.3. HQ AFSOC/SGPO will maintain a copy of all documentation of deployed HCP chart
     reviews for two years for quality assurance purposes.
     1.8.4. HQ AFSOC/SGPO will maintain a copy of all documentation of deployed
     IDMT/NREMT-P chart reviews for two years for quality assurance purposes.

2.1. Immunizations. AFSOC personnel are individually responsible and accountable for
maintaining current immunizations. This guidance, along with AFJI 48-110, Immunizations and
Chemoprophylaxis, provides implementation instructions for immunization requirements.
Additional immunization and chemoprophylaxis requirements may be recommended by the Joint
Preventive Medicine Policy Group or may be required by Theater Combatant Commanders
(COCOM). AFSOC MTFs/medical units/OSMs will track immunization requirements for
assigned personnel and will notify commanders regarding non-compliant members.
Additionally, AFSOC MTF’s will supply the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Form 731, International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (Yellow shot record) to
members deploying where reporting instructions or the applicable country’s foreign clearance
guide specifically states that members entering their country must provide immunization
documentation on the CDC Form 731.
     2.1.1. Standard Immunizations. Immunizations provided to AFSOC personnel fulfill
     standard DOD and Air Force immunization requirements for worldwide deployment, as well
     as directives issued by relevant COCOMs (i.e. Central Command (CENTCOM), Pacific
     Command (PACOM), European Command (EUCOM), Africa Command (AFRICOM),
     DOD, and Service vaccine policies can be found on the Military Vaccines (MILVAX) web
     site                    Quick                    References                    Section

                    FORCE HEALTH AND AIRCREW MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Physical Standards. Physical standards are designed to ensure acquisition and
retention of members who are medically acceptable for military duty and capable of performing
the requirements of their Air Force specialty. When making aeromedical dispositions, AFSOC
flight surgeons must refer to AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, AF and AFSOC
policy letters, and the USAF Aerospace Medicine Waiver Guide published by the Aeromedical
Consultation       Service     AFMS       Knowledge        Exchange        -     Waiver     Guide
(https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kj.do?functionalArea=WaiverGuide).                AETC policy
letters will be consulted regarding medical issues pertaining to certain training programs. Flight
surgeons will refer to the aforementioned references in order to assist special operations
personnel who require examination certification and/or medical waivers.
     3.1.1. All initial flying special operations duty and accession physical examinations must be
     entered into the Physical Examination Processing Program (PEPP). Certification authority
     for initial examinations is designated in AFI 48-123, Attachment 2, Certification and Waiver
     Authority.
     3.1.2. Certification and waiver authority for Flying Class III examinations for prospective
     Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)/Mission Planner – Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MP-UAV)
     and Sensor Operator personnel is as designated in AFI 48-123. HQ AFSOC/SGP/SGPA is
     the certification and waiver authority for AFSOC personnel, with exception to trained Flying
     Class (FC) II personnel requiring categorical (FC IIA RPA duty) waiver, in which case Air
     Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA)/SG3P is the authority.
     3.1.3. Delegation of Disqualification Authority. Disqualification authority for initial FC III
     examinations that are discontinued due to a clearly disqualifying condition is delegated to
     AFSOC assigned Residency in Aerospace Medicine (RAM). For AFSOC personnel assigned
     to locations without an AFSOC RAM, or in the absence of an AFSOC RAM, the authority is
     delegated to HQ AFSOC/SGP/SGPA. Further delegation of this authority is not authorized.
     Air Education and Training Command (AETC)/SGPS serves as the appellate authority
     should a disqualification decision be disputed.
        3.1.3.1. All locally disqualified initial FC III physical examinations will be entered into
        PEPP. Additionally, per AFI 48-123, paragraph 6.1.3.1.4.1., “The examining flight
        surgeon completely identifies, describes, or documents the disqualifying defects and

        procedures to meet DOD, COCOM and AF policies and Public Law related to
        deployment health and surveillance.
        3.3.1.2. Operational medical units/OSMs at bases supported by non-AFSOC MTFs are
        responsible for coordination of deployment health activities with the supporting MTF.
        (T-2).
     3.3.2. Deployment Health Requirements. DOD requirements for deployment health
     surveillance are published in DODI 6490.03, Deployment Health (11 August 2006). The
     DODI can be accessed at: http://fhp.osd.mil/pdfs/649003p.pdf. AF Manual 48-154,
     Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment, contains current Occupational and
     Environmental Health site assessment guidance. Current DOD and AF health surveillance
     requirements can be accessed at: http://www.pdhealth.mil/dcs/default.asp. Combatant
     commanders publish additional requirements. Deployment Resiliency Assessments (DRA)
     will be administered in accordance with AFI 48-120, Deployment Resiliency Assessments,
     https://kx.afms.mil/.
        3.3.2.1. DODI 6490.03 directs deployment health surveillance for Outside the
        Continental United States (OCONUS) deployments greater than 30 days to locations with
        non-fixed U.S. MTFs (see Table E4.T2.). For OCONUS deployments of 30 days or less,
        OCONUS deployments to locations with fixed U.S. MTFs and CONUS deployments,
        deployment health activities are based on the health threats identified during the
        deployment, the health risk assessment, and the decisions of the COCOM commander,
        service component commander, or commander exercising operational control.
     3.3.3. AFSOC MTF Public Health will track and ensure compliance with deployment health
     surveillance requirements for deploying AFSOC personnel. However, AFSOC OSM
     medical personnel will track and ensure compliance with deployment health surveillance
     requirements for deploying AFSOC personnel stationed at non-AFSOC bases. In cases such
     as this, OSM medical personnel will coordinate with the host base MTF regarding
     deployment surveillance, compliance and tracking. For deploying AFSOC personnel
     stationed at locations without an AFSOC MTF or OSM medical personnel, other assigned
     AFSOC medical personnel (flight surgeons/IDMT/NREMT-Ps) will track and ensure
     compliance with deployment health surveillance requirements and will maintain close
     coordination with the host base MTF. (T-2).
     3.3.4. AFSOC MTF Public Health flights will cross check pre- and post-deployment health
     assessment deployment logs with a redeployed personnel roster, obtained from the Military
     Personnel Service (MPS) monthly, in order to ensure all required post-deployment
     surveillance requirements are completed and documented. For AFSOC personnel assigned to
     locations without AFSOC MTFs, other assigned AFSOC medical personnel (OSM medical
     personnel/fight surgeons/IDMT/NREMT-Ps) will coordinate closely with the host MTF to
     ensure AFSOC personnel receive appropriate post-deployment surveillance and follow up.

provider (Flight Surgeon, PA or IDMT/NREMT-P) will establish processes to ensure DOD, AF
and COCOM health surveillance requirements are fulfilled.
   3.5.1. In-process personnel at deployed location to accomplish the following tasks:
      3.5.1.1. For deployments greater than 30 days, collect DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive
      and Chronic Care Flow sheet, which will be used as the deployed medical record. Note:
      See section 3.5.1.3. below.
      3.5.1.2. If pre-deployment Health Assessments are required for the deployment, check
      for completion of DD Form 2795, Pre-Deployment Health Assessment Questionnaire. If
      not completed at home station, accomplish DD Form 2795 at the deployed location per
      DOD and AF policy (http://www.pdhealth.mil/dcs/pre_deploy.asp).
      3.5.1.3. Ensure data for deployed personnel is entered in Air Force Complete
      Immunization Tracking Application (AFCITA), or other approved data base. Note:
      Personnel Support of Contingency Operations’ (PERSCO) database may be leveraged in
      order to fulfill this requirement.
3.6. Medical Information Management.
   3.6.1. All operational medical units must deploy with and must utilize the laptop based
   Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP), the Army’s Medical Communications for
   Combat Casualty Care (MC4) system, the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology
   Application – Theater (AHLTA-T), or similar approved systems to collect and document all
   patient encounters. Failure to appropriately document patient encounters constitutes a
   serious breach in standard of care.
   3.6.2. Patient encounter information collected in TMIP and other systems will be
   downloaded to the Theater Medical Data System (TMDS) from the deployed location. If this
   download is impossible (inconvenience does not equate to impossible) the TMIP information
   will be downloaded to the Military Health System Clinical Data Repository (MHS CDR)
   when deployed medical personnel return to home station.
   3.6.3. TMIP Training: All operational medical units will ensure deploying members are
   trained and proficient to utilize TMIP and have reach back support to a unit member who has
   been trained as a TMIP “super user.” The TMIP “super user” is responsible for unit TMIP
   usage, user training/proficiency, and patient information downloading.
   3.6.4. All operational medical units will ensure deployable computers are functional and
   loaded with TMIP before deploying. Any shortfalls or problems will be identified to HQ
   AFSOC/SGX (see paragraph 1.9.).

                  MEDICAL TRAINING AND CLINICAL CURRENCY

4.1. Medical Training. Operational AFSOC medical personnel* are required to provide only
the very best aeromedical (encompassing all aspects of aerospace medicine programs)
healthcare, preventive healthcare, routine healthcare, emergency medical care, trauma care,
surgical care, critical care and combat health support services to AFSOC and Joint SOF
personnel. AFSOC operational medical personnel will provide these services in austere and
remote tactical deployment environments as well as the in-garrison environment. Additionally,
AFSOC operational medical personnel will execute Irregular Warfare/Medical Stability
Operations (IW/MSO). The most critical mission essential task of all AFSOC medics is to fully
and unequivocally meet/exceed all clinical competency and clinical currency requirements.
AFSOC medical personnel who fail to meet clinical competency/clinical currency requirements
may also be subject to medical privilege abeyance and/or adverse credentials action IAW AFI
44-119. Requirements apply to all AFSOC UTC assigned personnel regardless of prior
experience level/positions. However, if newly assigned personnel have previously served in a
similar position in an AFSOC unit, portions of stated mission qualification requirements may be
waived by HQ AFSOC/SG on a case-by-case basis, based upon documented completion of
mission requirements. HQ AFSOC/SG is waiver authority; however, waivers will be granted
only in extreme circumstances. Waiver requests will be submitted via official AF memo and will
contain the following: Member’s name, rank, position, unit and reason for member’s failure to
comply with requirement(s), justification for waiver, impact if waiver disapproved, plan to
correct discrepancy/comply with requirement(s), and date of expected compliance (see
Attachment 5 for format). Waiver request must be indorsed by member’s squadron and group
commander. All waiver requests will be returned to requesting unit via standard channels. If
approved, unless stated otherwise, waivers will remain valid for no longer than 90 days from the
approval date. Note: Operational AFSOC Medical Personnel are defined as any personnel
assigned to an AFSOC UTC and/or STS assigned IMDT’s, PA’s and Flight Surgeons.
4.2. Administration of Medical Training.
   4.2.1. Formal Training. HQ AFSOC/SG is responsible for validating medical training
   requirements and clinical currency requirements.        Additionally, HQ AFSOC/SG is
   responsible for medical oversight/management of AFSOC’s medical training pipeline and for
   scheduling and tracking initial/sustainment training for AFSOC’s operational medical
   personnel. Unit commanders will ensure assigned operational medical personnel attend all
   required training and that assigned operational medical personnel meet clinical competency
   and clinical currency requirements.
   4.2.2. Medical Training Manager Appointment. All commanders of AFSOC units with
   medical personnel assigned will appoint, in writing, a primary and alternate Medical Training
   Manager (MTM). The MTM will serve as unit POC for medical training. (T-3).
       4.2.2.1. A unit MTM appointment letter will be forwarded to HQ AFSOC/SGXT. The
       appointment letter must include; name, rank, DSN/commercial phone numbers, duty
       email for both primary and alternate MTM.

     4.2.3. Formal Training Projection:
        4.2.3.1. HQ AFSOC/SGXT will send a training spreadsheet to all AFSOC MTMs
        requesting projections for all training course requirements for officer, enlisted and
        civilian personnel for the next fiscal year. Suspense for unit medical requirement
        projections submission to HQ AFSOC/SGXT will be 30 days from spreadsheet
        distribution.
        4.2.3.2. Unit MTMs will base medical training requirement projections for the next fiscal
        year upon anticipated unit losses/gains due to PCS, separations, retirements, etc., and
        based upon identified training discrepancies in unit’s assigned medical personnel.
        4.2.3.3. Training quotas will be subsequently allocated by AETC, Air Force Material
        Command (AFMC), Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) and Air Force
        Special Operations Training Center (AFSOTC) to HQ AFSOC/SGXT.                  HQ
        AFSOC/SGXT will notify Unit MTMs of the training quotas available for each unit.
        Unit commanders will ensure their training quotas are filled.
        4.2.3.4. Unit MTMs will submit the full name, grade and SSN of the individuals selected
        for the allocated quotas to HQ AFSOC/SGXT. Type 5 training courses (identified by a 5
        in the second digit of the course number) require the addition of security clearance, unit
        mailing address, duty title and DSN.
        4.2.3.5. Requests for out-of-cycle training requirements and for additional training
        quotas will be sent by unit MTMs via letter, e-mail, or fax to HQ AFSOC/SGXT. These
        requests must include the course title, course number and the individual’s information as
        described in paragraph 4.2.3.4.
     4.2.4. The unit MTM will submit to HQ AFSOC/SGXT the full name, grade, SSN and
     RNLTD of individuals selected for assignment to operational medical units in order to permit
     scheduling of required training. Whenever it is possible required training should be
     accomplished en route to unit of assignment.
     4.2.5. Special Operations Combat Medic Skills Sustainment Course (SOCMSSC).
        4.2.5.1. SOCMSSC satisfies all SOCOM recertification for AFSOC PJs and IDMTs for
        their NREMT-P. This course also provides Advanced Tactical Practitioner (ATP)
        recertification for ATP certified IDMT/NREMT-Ps and PJs. AFSOC 4N0X1C’s are
        eligible to test for ATP certification upon completion of NREMT-P certification. Due to
        limited availability of seats in SOCMSSC, USSOCOM-SG approved source as a
        “SOCMSSC equivalent” independent contractor certified to provide NREMT-P and ATP
        re-certification IAW USSOCOM Directive 350-29, SOF Medical Training Requirements
        (3 Mar 2011 SOCS-SG MFR Policy Letter).
        4.2.5.2. All AFSOC ATP certified operational medical personnel and PJs must attend
        SOCMSSC or a SOCOM-SG approved equivalent course. USSOCOM Directive 350-29
        specifies biennial recertification of these medical requirements through either SOCMSSC
        or SOCOM/SG approved equivalent courses.
        4.2.5.3. All AFSOC IDMT/NREMT-Ps, who have not attained ATP certification, will
        attend SOCMSSC or a SOCOM SG approved equivalent courses if seats are available.
AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               21


      HQ AFSOC/SGXT will coordinate sustainment training for AFSOC IDMT/NREMT-Ps
      who are unable to attend SOCMSSC due to insufficient training slots.
      4.2.5.4. Requests to attend SOCMSSC should be submitted by unit MTMs to HQ
      AFSOC/SGXT as early as possible (requests may be submitted up to 1 year before course
      start date, but must be submitted by unit MTMs no later than 45 days before course start
      date). HQ AFSOC/SGXT will schedule operational medical personnel and PJs via the
      US Army Training Requirements and Resources System (ATRRS).
      4.2.5.5. Additions or deletions to the projected SOCMSSC schedule must be coordinated
      through HQ AFSOC/SGXT. MTMs, operational medical personnel and PJs are not
      authorized to coordinate additions, deletions, or name changes directly with SOCMSSC.
      4.2.5.6. Requests for training at SOCOM-SG approved SOCMSSC equivalent courses
      will be made by unit training representatives with HQ AFSOC/SGXT coordination.
      Utilizing these alternate courses incurs additional unit-funded expenses over the
      SOCMSSC program.
   4.2.6. Required medical training for operational medical personnel (excluding PJs) will be
   certified and reported via Medical Readiness Decision Support System (MRDSS). (T-1).
4.3. Clinical Competency/Currency/Medical Training Requirements.
   4.3.1. AFSOCI 48-101 clinical competency/currency/medical training requirements for
   AFSOC medical personnel and medical UTCs may be added, deleted, or modified by HQ
   AFSOC/SG policy letter. HQ AFSOC/SGX/SGP will review and track compliance with all
   clinical competency requirements, clinical currency requirements, medical training pipeline
   completion requirements, mission qualification requirements and/or other training
   requirements contained herein. HQ AFSOC/SGXT will maintain a current training database
   that includes the status of all AFSOC operational medical personnel and will report, in
   writing, any discrepancies or noncompliance to HQ AFSOC/SG and the appropriate unit
   commander. Compliance with all clinical competency, currency, and medical training
   requirements will be evaluated during compliance inspections (CIs) and/or Staff Assistance
   Visits (SAV).
      4.3.1.1. USAF Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP) Currency/Proficiency. All
      AFSOC operational medical personnel must complete all required AFSC RSVP training.
      (T-1).
   4.3.2. All AFSOC operational medical personnel must meet USAF, AFMS, AFMOA and
   host MTF requirements that govern the delivery of healthcare. Furthermore, credentialed and
   non-credentialed healthcare providers, even those assigned directly to line units must
   complete all medical training and credentialing required to remain in good standing with the
   host MTF. Additionally, operational medical personnel who are considered “professional
   staff” must attend host MTF professional staff meetings.
   4.3.3. Clinical competency and clinical currency are the most important and most critical
   qualifications that AFSOC operational medics bring to the fight. All operational medical
   personnel, without exception, must meet/exceed all clinical competency and clinical currency
   requirements. Clinical competency and clinical currency are extraordinarily perishable.
   Consequently, in order to maintain these perishable qualifications, the primary emphasis of
22                                                          AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


     in-garrison activities will be directed to this end, i.e., the delivery of healthcare in clinic and
     hospital settings. In order to ensure operational medical personnel meet the clinical
     competency and clinical currency standards, the delivery of in-garrison healthcare in
     clinic/hospital settings must supersede all activities and additional duties except operational
     deployments required training exercises, mandatory training and mandatory unit functions
     such as commander’s call. In order to meet minimal clinical competency/clinical currency
     requirements, AFSOC operational medical personnel must complete the clinical exposure
     requirements listed in the following tables, as well as AFSC specific requirements. These
     requirements contain both minimum number of days in clinic per quarter as well as a
     minimum number of patients treated, or surgeries/procedures performed. Unit Commanders
     will ensure assigned operational medical personnel develop schedules to meet clinical
     exposure requirements contained herein.
        4.3.3.1. Mission Qualification Training. This section establishes the minimum medical
        training requirements to attain initial mission qualified status.
            4.3.3.1.1. Special Operations Force Medical Element (SOFME) personnel are
            mission qualified after completing formal AFSC awarding courses/programs, RSVP
            training and the AFSOC medical training pipeline. SOFME personnel also must
            complete the mission ready clinical currency requirements as shown in Table 4.1.
            before their initial deployment.
            4.3.3.1.2. Special Operations Surgical Team (SOST)/Special Operations Critical
            Care Evacuation Team (SOCCET) medical personnel are mission qualified after
            completing formal AFSC medical/surgical training programs/courses, RSVP training
            and AFSOC medical training pipeline. SOST/SOCCET medical personnel must be in
            good standing with host MTF and must be clinically competent and current in order
            to attain mission qualification.
            4.3.3.1.3. SOST/SOCCET medical personnel will maintain clinical competency and
            clinical currency IAW requirements/guidelines set by AFMS, functional area
            managers, AFMS corps chiefs, AF/SG specialty consultants, applicable professional
            standards to include licensure, board certification, continuing medical education
            requirements and those contained herein. Additionally, general/orthopedic surgeons,
            anesthesiologists, emergency medicine specialists are expected to obtain specialty
            board certification.      Certified registered nurse anesthetists will maintain all
            certifications, a robust clinical schedule and must be considered in good standing with
            host MTF. Critical care nurses will maintain all certifications and will maintain a
            robust clinical schedule and be considered in good standing with host MTF Chief,
            Nurse Services (SGN). Surgical technicians and respiratory therapy technicians will
            maintain all certifications and will maintain a robust clinical schedule and be
            considered in good standing with host MTF SGH/SGN. AFSOC physicians are
            expected to obtain specialty board certification. Failure to accomplish specialty board
            certification when eligible to do so will result in loss of mission/ deployment
            qualification deploy-ability, even for administrative/leadership deployment positions.
        4.3.3.2. Clinical Currency Requirements for AFSOC Operational Medical Personnel.
            4.3.3.2.1. AFSOC operational medical personnel are expected/required to be experts
            in their respective clinical specialties/fields. Additionally, AFSOC operational
AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   23


          medical personnel are expected/required to be fully interoperable with other
          USSOCOM component SOF medical personnel and to be ready for deployed
          operations in high-threat, uncertain and/or hostile environments. Operational medical
          personnel must maintain a high level of physical fitness and operational readiness.
          Operational training requirements not listed in this instruction must not be allowed to
          supersede any requirements listed herein.
              4.3.3.2.1.1. The following clinical currency requirements represent the minimal
              standard of clinical currency acceptable for AFSOC medical personnel. Note:
              AFSOC personnel and component SOF personnel strive to achieve performance
              standards greater than the minimal standard; therefore, the minimal clinical
              currency standard is considered a starting point, not an end point. Clinical
              currency standards will primarily be achieved within the host MTF and/or
              credentialing MTF whenever possible. These requirements may also be fulfilled
              while TDY in an official training or duty status, or in a local training agreement or
              rotation established by the host MTF or HQ AFSOC/SG in order to obtain clinical
              currency caseload not available at the host/credentialing MTF. Patient encounters
              obtained while deployed can be submitted for clinical credentialing requirements,
              provided the encounter has been appropriately documented and subjected to peer
              review (this can be accomplished following re-deployment if not co-located with
              another AFSOC FS at the deployed location). (T-1).

 Notes:
 1. Non-currency in any Table 4.1. core mission event constitutes failure and results in
 immediate loss of mission qualification status.
 2. Quarterly (Q) requirements are events required at intervals of 3 months, October-
 December, January-March, April-June and July-September. Clinical currency requirements
 will be prorated when member is deployed in support of an operational mission tasking or
 other required TDY/training events.
 3. Annual (A) requirements must be accomplished during the January-December period.
 4. Eye examinations to be completed with ophthalmologist or optometrist guidance. Eye
 examinations must include all exam components described in AFSOCI 48-1391.
 5. Other acute care patient encounters are defined as, documented Peer Reviewable encounter
 outside of MTF.
      4.3.3.3. SOST/SOCCET Clinical Currency Requirements are listed by AFSC in the
      subsequent paragraphs. The clinical caseload is a minimum and additional clinical
      experience is encouraged in order to remain on a high proficiency level. The clinical
      caseload for each AFSC is based on an expected annual training cycle that includes 6
      weeks leave and holidays, 10 weeks operational training, and 36 weeks of dedicated
      clinical patient care. This equates to 9 clinical weeks per quarter. A training regimen of
      greater than 10 weeks of operational training per year must be approved by the unit’s
      Squadron CC. Credit for clinical currency caseloads will be prorated when surgeon is
      deployed in support of “real-world” mission tasking to include approved reconstitution
      time. Therefore, patient care provided in the deployed setting will not factor into the
      currency numbers listed in the following paragraphs.
          4.3.3.3.1. General Surgeon, 45S3.
              4.3.3.3.1.1. General Surgeons assigned to AFSOC are required to maintain the
              same surgical/clinical currency, trauma currency, work hours, and clinical
              practice as their non-AFSOC peers except as detailed below.
              4.3.3.3.1.2. Minimal clinical currency requirement for AFSOC-assigned
              surgeons: 126 cases/year (32 cases/quarter; 3.5 cases/week). Thirty percent of
              these cases must be major cases defined by the AF/SG consultant for general
              surgery as “currency” cases. Participation as the assistant surgeon may account
              for 30% of the case total. (T-1).
              4.3.3.3.1.3. Trauma skills maintenance. Requirement for biennial CSTARS
              attendance may be waived in lieu of participation in a designated trauma training
              rotation with clinical and hands-on responsibility approved by HQ
              AFSOC/SGPO.
          4.3.3.3.2. Orthopedic Surgeon, 45B3.
              4.3.3.3.2.1. Orthopedic Surgeons assigned to AFSOC are required to maintain the
              same surgical/clinical currency, trauma currency, work hours, and clinical
              practice as their non-AFSOC peers except as detailed below.

          shifts/quarter; 2.5 shifts/week) as directed by the facility. (T-1).
          4.3.3.3.5.3. Cross-training nursing shifts may be substituted for up to 50% of the
          critical care nursing shifts per quarter. Appropriate cross-training consists of an
          equivalent amount of time participating in surgical/anesthesia cases, operating
          suite, post-anesthesia recovery unit, or emergency department.
       4.3.3.3.6. Operating Room/Surgical Technicians, 4N171.
          4.3.3.3.6.1. Operating Room/Surgical Technicians will maintain the same clinical
          licensure and recurring medical training as non-AFSOC peers as directed by the
          USAF functional manager.         However, AFSOC Operating Room/Surgical
          Technicians will obtain and maintain National Surgical Assistant certification
          while assigned to AFSOC UTCs.
26                                                       AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


               4.3.3.3.6.2. Minimal clinical currency caseload for Operating Room/Surgical
               Technicians is 126 cases/year (32 cases/quarter; 3.5 cases/week). Credit for
               surgical caseload may be given fulfilling roles in central sterilization, OR supply,
               and training of other technicians as additional duties. However, no less than 75%
               (95 cases/year) of clinical currency caseload must be operative cases as the
               primary or secondary surgical technician. (T-1).

               Cardiopulmonary/Respiratory Therapy Technicians assigned to AFSOC is 108
               clinical shifts/year (27 shifts/quarter; 3 shifts/week). (T-1).
               4.3.3.3.7.2. Cross-training cardiopulmonary/respiratory therapy shifts may be
               substituted for up to eight cardiopulmonary/respiratory therapy shifts per quarter.
               Appropriate cross-training consists of an equivalent amount of time participating
               in surgical/anesthesia care in the operating suite, post-anesthesia recovery unit or
               emergency department.
               4.3.3.3.7.3. Cardiopulmonary/respiratory therapy technicians should possess
               current Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) certification prior to AFSOC
               assignment. However, cardiopulmonary/respiratory therapy technicians who do
               not already possess current CRT certification must obtain CRT certification
               within 6 months of assignment to AFSOC UTCs.                        Additionally,
               Cardiopulmonary/respiratory therapy technicians assigned to AFSOC UTCs will
               obtain and maintain Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) certification within 1
               year of assignment to AFSOC UTCs. HQ AFSOC/SG will fund Respiratory
               Therapist (RT) certification if the sponsoring medical institution will not fund.
               Once RRT certification is obtained, requirement to maintain CRT is eliminated.
               (T-2).
        4.3.3.4. HQ AFSOC/SG may delegate waiver authority for SOFME mission ready
        clinical medical requirements to HQ AFSOC/Chief, Aerospace Medicine (SGP) and for

   4.5.1. AFSOC PAs will comply with training and recertification requirements as defined by
   AFI 44-102.
   4.5.2. AFSOC operationally (OSM) assigned PAs assigned to operational medical units must
   audit the Air Force AMP course within the first year assigned to AFSOC. Because the Army
   AMP course does not teach Air Force aerospace medicine principles and often conflicts with
   specific Air Force guidance and policies, AFSOC PAs are not authorized to attend the Army
   AMP course at Ft Rucker. Additionally, AFSOC PAs assigned as operational medical
   personnel will comply with aforementioned AFSOCI 48-101 requirements and Table 4.1.
   requirements. (T-2).
       4.5.2.1. AFSOC PAs assigned as operational medical personnel will coordinate with the
       host MTF SGH to update PA privilege list to document the appropriate scope of practice
       IAW AFI 44-119 requirements.

4.6. AFSOC Medical Training Pipeline. All newly assigned (at the publication time of this
instruction) AFSOC operational medical personnel are required to successfully complete
AFSOC’s medical training pipeline. All fully qualified operational medical personnel assigned
to an AFSOC unit prior to the publication of this instruction are grandfathered into the new
instruction standards. All AFSOC Medical personnel assigned to an AFSOC UTC are required
to complete their applicable training/currency requirements as outlined in Tables 4.4.–4.16. The
AFSOC Medical Training Pipeline is specific to each AFSC in a designated AFSOC Unit Type
Code (UTC). Each training requirement has been placed into a phase of instruction to better
identify sequential courses for unit MTM’s as they prioritize training requirements. These
phases of instruction are broken into three categories: Phase I–Courses that are related to the
Introduction to Special Operations and Special Operations Medicine, Phase II–Courses that are
primarily combat or field skills related and Phase III–Courses that provide advanced AFSC or
UTC training. While it is preferred that individuals follow the required phase instruction order,
it is not mandatory. HQ AFSOC/SGXT manages the medical pipeline training slots and
coordinates with unit commanders and/or their MTM’s in order to fill training slots with
operational medical personnel (to include AFSOC ANG/AFRC medical personnel who fill
AFSOC UTCs) who require this UTC/AFSC specific training. Additionally, HQ AFSOC/SGXT
will manage/administer sections of all three phases of instruction. For courses that are
administered by USAF Special Operations School (USAFSOS), unit MTM’s can coordinate
directly with them. MRDSS is the tracking database for all medical readiness training
completion. HQ AFSOC/SGXT will monitor MRDSS on a weekly basis. Units may utilize their
own tracking mechanism for scheduling training and completion; however MRDSS-ULTRA is
the sole source of documentation for medical readiness training IAW AFI 41-106, paragraph
6.2.3. HQ AFSOC/SGXT will report discrepancies quarterly to HQ AFSOC/SG and unit
commanders. Unit commanders will ensure assigned/attached operational medical personnel

meet USAF physical fitness standards, clinical competency/currency requirements and all
training requirements contained herein. Full mission qualification status will be granted (at unit
level) when personnel are clinically current and have completed all required training phases of
instruction in the AFSOC medical training pipeline. (T-2).
     4.6.1. UTC Specific Training Tables: Tables 4.4. through 4.16. outline required training for
     personnel assigned to specific AFSOC medical UTCs. The status of all required training will
     be updated as training is completed using MRDSS-ULTRA. Unless otherwise delegated, HQ
     AFSOC/SG is the waiver authority for all required training. (T-1).

 Orientation Courses
 Note: Recommended courses can only be scheduled after all required training has been
 completed, and it does not take precedence over quarterly clinical competency/clinical
 currency requirements. Recommended training, if not centrally funded by the Air Force, is
 unit funded and approved.
   4.6.3. Cancellation policy for required Medical Training Pipeline courses: Operational
   Medical Personnel that are scheduled to attend a required training pipeline course must be
   formally cancelled with appropriate justification following the below process:
38                                                     AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


        4.6.3.1. 1st cancellation of member – Flight Commander will submit request for
        cancellation to HQ AFSOC/SGXT with appropriate justification.
        4.6.3.2. 2nd cancellation of same member/same course – SQ/CC will submit request for
        cancellation to HQ AFSOC/SGP and/or SGX with appropriate justification.
        4.6.3.3. 3rd cancellation of same member/same course – Grp/CC will submit request for
        cancellation to HQ AFSOC/SG with appropriate justification.
     4.6.4. Approved Training Platforms:
        4.6.4.1. NREMT-P: Initial and refresher (every 2 years) NREMT-P training for
        4N0X1Cs accomplished only by training platforms approved by HQ AFSOC/SG.
            4.6.4.1.1. All ATP personnel will attend the Special Operations Medical Skills
            Sustainment Course or HQ AFSOC/SG and USSOCOM/SG approved substitute.
        4.6.4.2. Trauma Training:   FFQEK, FFQE3 and FFQE4 UTC personnel will
        complete/maintain Trauma Skills Sustainment and trauma related Continuing Medical
        Education (CME).
            4.6.4.2.1. Trauma Skills Sustainment: In addition to aforementioned clinical
            competency/clinical currency requirements, FFQEK, FFQE3 and FFQE4 UTC
            personnel require periodic exposure to hands-on human trauma patient management
            in a controlled environment where current best practices in trauma care can be
            refreshed. At a minimum, FFQEK, FFQE3 and FFQE4 UTC personnel require
            AFSC appropriate exposure to 20 trauma patients during the previous two years.
            Surgeons at Level I trauma centers who are unable to meet the American College of
            Surgeons’ recommendation to operate and manage 35 multi-trauma patients per year
            must attend C-STARS every 24 months. AFSOC personnel performing regular duties
            at a Level I or II Trauma center and able to meet the 35 multi-trauma’s a year will
            follow the 24 month CSTARS waiver process as outlined in AFI 41-106. SOCCET
            personnel must attend C-STARS at the University of Cincinnati. Approved methods
            for acquiring additional trauma patient experience are:
               4.6.4.2.1.1. A training program similar to CSTARS. Alternate programs will
               require formal approval by HQ AFSOC/SG and must provide significant exposure
               to traumatized human patients.
               4.6.4.2.1.2. Appropriately documented trauma patient management (patient
               name, injuries, procedure(s) performed, etc.) while deployed may be counted for
               up to 50% of this trauma skills sustainment requirement. However, the
               documented trauma patient care must be subject to, and available for, the formal

   5.8.2. EMT-I/P Treatment Protocols for Air Force Special Operations Medical Technicians.
   AFSOC Handbook 48-1, EMT-I/P Protocols for Air Force Special Operations Medical
   Technicians, is approved as the ACLS medication formulary and protocol handbook for
   Independent Duty Medical Technicians. Specifically, AFSC 4N0X1C, assigned as AFSOC
   operational medical personnel special tactics unit positions. The scope of practice for
   AFSOC IDMTs performing EMT-I/P duties is limited to these protocols. Proposed changes
   to these protocols must be approved by HQ AFSOC/SGPO and HQ AFSOC/SG.
5.9. AFSOC Pararescueman/Pararescue Jumper (PJ) Medical Program.
   5.9.1. AFSOC PJ Medical Guidance.
      5.9.1.1. PJs are rescue specialists with NREMT-P training/certification. AFSOC PJs are
      trained and tasked to provide emergency medical care at the paramedic/USSOCOM ATP
      level. PJs are combatants, and thus are not protected as medical personnel by the Geneva
      Conventions or International Law. Continuous NREMT-P currency is required for
      service in the PJ 1T2X1 AFSC.
      5.9.1.2. PJs are not tasked to provide routine medical care. PJs are not authorized to
      provide “sick call” medical care in garrison or while deployed. PJs are not permitted to
      diagnose illnesses/injuries or to dispense medications in these circumstances. PJs will
      defer requests for medical care to the appropriate local medical treatment system.
      5.9.1.3. During extended isolated military operations such as patrols, reconnaissance and
      surveillance missions, or forward operation bases, when physicians or IDMTs are not
      available, a PJ may utilize skills, techniques, and medications as appropriately trained,
      approved, and documented, utilizing approved published guidance (see paragraph 5.9.5.).
   5.9.2. PJ Medical Program Management. Overarching USAF PJ medical program
   management is contained in AFI 16-1202, Volumes 1 and 2. PJ medical training and
   qualification will be extensively documented and maintained in the member's AF Form 623,
   Individual Training Record Folder. For convenience, medical training records may be
   maintained geographically separated from the AF623 record; refer to AFI 16-1202, Volume
   1, for guidance.
      5.9.2.1. Air Combat Command (ACC) is the lead USAF MAJCOM for PJ medical
      issues. ACC/SGP addresses medical qualifications, requirements, and PJ medication and
      procedures handbook issues. Changes to training, protocols, medications, and equipment
      are coordinated through the ACC PJ MOAB. Formalized PJ MOAB conferences are
      conducted twice yearly, usually during June and December. HQ AFSOC/SGP, STG/SG
      and PJ representatives will attend MOABs.
   5.9.3. Medical Director and Medical Control.            USAF, DOD, and Department of
   Transportation (DOT) directives mandate appointment of a physician medical director to
   oversee the medical training, qualification, and practice of NREMT-Ps to include PJs. The
   PJ medical director must have expertise in operational medicine, trauma medicine, delivery
   of medical care in field environments and wilderness medicine, pre-hospital medical care,
   medical transport/evacuation systems and equipment.
48                                                       AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


        5.9.3.1. The medical director will be appointed in writing by the special tactics (ST) unit
        commander. A copy of the appointment letter will be forwarded to host base MTF SGH
        and to HQ AFSOC/SGPO. Additionally, a copy will be filed in each PJ’s medical
        training record. (T-2).
        5.9.3.2. The medical director will provide direct supervision and oversight/guidance to
        the special tactics unit Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) of medical training (NCOMT)
        if the medical director is assigned to the ST unit; otherwise, the NCOMT will be
        supervised by the Director of Operations or the PJ Team Superintendent.
            5.9.3.2.1. The medical director will review/audit PJ medical training status to ensure
            PJs remain fully current regarding required medical training. Additionally, the
            medical director will conduct unannounced medical proficiency exercises and
            evaluations to ensure PJs and other appropriate ST personnel meet medical and
            TCCC proficiency standards. The medical director will assist in planning and
            conducting PJ MEDEXs and MEDEVALs. (T-2).
        5.9.3.3. Medical control for PJs must be provided by a credentialed physician. PJs will
        follow the medical control order of precedence published in the Pararescue Medication
        and Procedure Handbook. When the unit medical director deploys with PJs, the medical
        director will coordinate with the Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF)/SG,
        TSOC/SG, JTF/SG or COCOM/SG to facilitate appropriate medical control for PJs.
        When PJs deploy without the unit medical director, the senior deployed PJ will
        coordinate with the JSOTF/SG, TSOC/SG, JTF/SG or COCOM/SG and the
        commander(s) of the medical unit(s) located in the AOR to establish medical control
        procedures to ensure physicians, who may provide medical control in the AOR,
        understand PJ mission/capabilities.
        5.9.3.4. PJs assigned above squadron level (i.e., Groups or Higher Headquarters (HHQs)
        will fall under the medical direction of the local ST squadron medical director.
     5.9.4. NCO Medical Training (NCOMT). The NCOMT will be designated by the unit
     commander in writing. The NCOMT will be supervised by the medical director if the
     medical director is assigned to the ST unit; otherwise, the NCOMT will be supervised by the
     Director of Operations or the PJ Team Superintendent. The NCOMT must work closely with
     the medical director and senior team PJ to ensure the PJ medical program is robustly
     managed. (T-1).
        5.9.4.1. The NCOMT will be a fully qualified IDMT/NREMT-P, preferably with an
        operational background. The NCOMT should have at least two years experience as an
        IDMT/NREMT-P and should be an experienced Basic Life Support (BLS), Self-Aid and
        Buddy Care (SABC), and TCCC instructor. The NCOMT will maintain currency as an
        IDMT/NREMT-P. (T-2).
        5.9.4.2. The NCOMT will manage the PJ medical program. The NCOMT will utilize the
        AFI 16-1202 series as medical program guidance. Medical program management
        includes maintaining medical training records and documentation, conducting medical
        classes/training, and conducting or assisting with MEDEXs and MEDEVALs. Program
        management also includes coordinating currency training (SOFMSSP), ATP exams,
        patient contact/trauma sustainment rotation (UAB, CSTARS), TOMS Lab training, CME
AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                              49


     lectures/classes, and supplementary medical courses. The NCOMT will track medical
     training status for all PJs. Additionally, the NCOMT will assist with operational medical
     planning as required.
     5.9.4.3. The NCOMT’s secondary duties will include conducting required medical
     classes and training for unit operators and personnel. Additionally the medical director
     and NCOMT will provide emergency medical coverage for unit training.
  5.9.5. Operational Medical Guidance. AFSOC PJs will follow approved published guidance
  for medical treatment protocols. Guidance includes the following:
     5.9.5.1. First line combat/operational. Pararescue Medication and Procedure Handbook
     (current edition). This handbook is the approved PJ formulary IAW AFI 16-1202,
     Volume 1.
     5.9.5.2. Second line combat/operational.     USSOCOM Tactical Medical Emergency
     Protocols (TMEPs) for ATPs.
     5.9.5.3. Third line garrison/civil pre-hospital emergency medical care. AFSOC
     Handbook 48-1, and additional appropriate paramedic level pre-hospital continuum of
     care as defined in current Brady or Mosby paramedic texts.
  5.9.6. Operational Medical Reporting. ST medical director and/or PJs will complete
  Guardian Angel Consolidated Mission Reports (GA CMRs) for all missions. Medical
  treatment information will be extracted for submission and legacy database input. (T-3).
     5.9.6.1. The GA CMRs must not contain classified/sensitive mission data, but must
     contain detailed medically relevant information.
     5.9.6.2. ST medical director and/or PJs will utilize ST medical director or deployed
     AFSOC flight surgeon as the conduit for GA CMR submission to HQ AFSOC/SGPO.
     5.9.6.3. ST medical director and/or PJs must ensure submission of the GA CMR to
     AFSOC/A3J, Command Personnel Recovery PJ Superintendent via secure
     communication channels. Additionally, submitting ST medical director and/or PJs will
     ensure the CMR does not include sensitive mission data prior to forwarding to HQ
     AFSOC/SGPO and ACC/SGP for database input.
  5.9.7. PJ Medical Qualification. The following qualifications and certifications are
  mandatory requirements for tactically operating PJs assigned to AFSOC:
     5.9.7.1. Current NREMT-P certification and all associated certification requirements,
     including BLS, Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) and ACLS. (T-1).
     5.9.7.2. Advanced Tactical Practitioner (ATP) Certification. ATP certification and
     currency is a mandatory USSOCOM requirement for AFSOC PJs (ATP certification is
     waived for AFSOC E-8 and E-9 PJs, unless deploying at the operational tactical level).
     ATP guidance is located in USSOCOM 350-29, SOF Combat Medical Training and
     Qualification. (T-1).
         5.9.7.2.1. AFSOC PJs who are not ATP certified/qualified/current must successfully
         complete ATP examination/requirements within six (6) months of assignment;
         otherwise, the PJ will not be qualified for deployment in any capacity. Newly
         assigned AFSOC PJs will be scheduled for SOFMSSP as soon as practical, but must
50                                                       AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


            be scheduled prior to, or within the newly assigned PJ’s next NREMT-P
            recertification cycle.
        5.9.7.3. Current Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC).
        5.9.7.4. Current Medical Evaluation IAW AFI 16-1202, Volume 2.
     5.9.8. Non-standard medications. Non-standard medications are defined as medications
     administered by PJs that are not included within the AFSOC Pararescue Medication and
     Procedure Handbook, the USSOCOM TMEPs or AFSOC Handbook 48-1.                            Any
     administration of non-standard medications by PJs must be strictly IAW DOD, USAF and
     USSOCOM policy, and must be unequivocally justified by mission requirements.
     Additionally, non-standard medication administration must be approved by the PJ’s medical
     director, STG/SG, HQ AFSOC/SGPO and HQ AFSOC/SG prior to use. Furthermore, a
     board certified physician must authorize the specific use of a non-standard medication. That
     physician assumes responsibility for administration of the medication. Appropriate training
     must be completed and documented prior to PJ administration of non-standard medications.
     If non-standard medication training is completed for PJs while deployed, the training must be
     thoroughly documented and a copy of the documentation must be forwarded to HQ
     AFSOC/SGPO and the PJ’s home station medical director, and NCOMT for placement in the
     PJ’s medical training record. If non-standard medication utilization is formally approved, the
     PJ who utilizes/administers the non-standard medication(s) will report the use/administration
     (report will contain patient’s name, age, medication, dosage and indications) to the
     supervising/authorizing physician, ST medical director, STG/SG and HQ AFSOC/SGPO.
     5.9.9. Experimental medical materials and equipment. Any use of experimental medical
     materials and equipment is not authorized unless formally approved via standard DOD,
     USSOCOM, USAF and AFSOC mechanisms.
5.10. Special Tactics Medical Logistics. (Jim Bosak needs to review)
     5.10.1. The AFSOC Medical Logistics Technician/4A1XX Functional Manager is
     responsible for the organization, training, and the coordination of 4A personnel assignments
     to AFSOC operational units. The 4A1XX functional will ensure compliance with AF and
     AFSOC instructions/policies.
     5.10.2. HQ AFSOC/SGXL is responsible for MEFPAK related requirements. Any proposed
     changes to MEFPAK allowance standards will be routed through 720 STG to HQ
     AFSOC/SGXL for headquarters oversight.     After validation and approval by HQ
     AFSOC/SG, HQ AFSOC/SGXL will forward medical allowance standard changes to
     ACC/SGXM.
     5.10.3. STG logistic technicians are responsible for ST unit War Reserve Material (WRM)
     and associated medical logistics functions.        Changes to medical logistics related
     policies/procedures will be coordinated with HQ AFSOC/SGXL and approved by HQ
     AFSOC/SG.
5.11. Special Operations Mental Health Flex Team (MHFT). MHFT personnel provide
mental health services/combat stress control to SOF forces in the in-garrison and deployed
environment. Additionally, this team will serve as consultants to AFSOC operational unit
personnel and commanders.
AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                      51


  5.11.1. MHFT composition: Psychologist (42P3), Psychiatrist (44P3), or Social Worker
  (42S3) and Mental Health Technician (4C071).
  5.11.2. Roles and responsibilities:
     5.11.2.1. The primary responsibility of MHFT personnel is to provide mental health
     services/combat stress control to SOF forces in the in-garrison and deployed
     environment. MHFT will provide battlefield mental health services/intervention,
     consultation and combat stress control. Additionally, MHFT will provide in-garrison
     preparation for, and reconstitution from, combat operations. MHFT provide the
     following services:

                                             Chapter 6

                   IN-GARRISON/HOME STATION RESPONSIBILITIES

6.1. AFSOC Operational Medical Personnel Responsibilities:
     6.1.1. Flight surgeons, SOST/SOCCET physicians, PAs, CRNAs, nurses, RTs,
     IDMT/NREMT-Ps, medical technicians, etc., assigned as operational medical personnel to
     operational AFSOC units have unique roles and responsibilities. C2 is executed through line
     commanders; however, when not deployed and when not participating in mandatory
     squadron functions/training/exercises, operational medical personnel are required to maintain
     clinical proficiency/currency, medical training requirements, clinical credentials and
     privileges. Meeting/sustaining the requirements contained herein qualifies AFSOC’s
     operational medical personnel for deployment. However, simply meeting/sustaining the
     minimum requirements does not ensure that AFSOC’s operational medical personnel are the
     very best and at the top of their medical/clinical/surgical/critical care game. Consequently,
     AFSOC operational medical personnel are expected to spend their in-garrison duty
     hours/time in clinic/hospital settings rather than performing squadron/unit extra duties, etc.,
     that are not directly related to the hands-on delivery of healthcare services. Bottom line: The
     primary purpose of AFSOC operational medical personnel is the delivery of world-class
     healthcare in both the in-garrison and deployed environment.
     6.1.2. The second priority of AFSOC’s operational medical personnel is being prepared for
     operational deployment. Operational medical personnel assigned to special tactics (not
     including PJs) units primarily provide medical support for ST field training events/exercises
     and primarily provide medical training/skills evaluation for PJ/ST personnel, rather than
     medical support in the deployed environment.
        6.1.2.1. When not deployed and when not participating in mandatory squadron
        functions/training/exercises, SOFME personnel will serve as an integral part of the in-
        garrison Aerospace Medicine Team, performing the same flight surgeon and technician
        duties (records reviews, exercises, etc.,) as non-SOFME flight surgeons and aeromedical
        enlisted personnel. SOFME personnel are, first and foremost are members of the medical
        community and will provide full-spectrum aerospace medicine support to AFSOC
        aircrew members and special duty personnel. As such, simply achieving minimum
        numbers of patient encounters does not exempt one from working additional clinic days.
        Bottom line: all AFSOC flight surgeons should be working together towards the
        successful execution of the base Aerospace Medicine Program (as defined in AFI 48-
        101). Additionally, each SOFME flight surgeon should have a primary operational
        squadron of attachment. This should be the unit where the bulk of line support (in the
        form of mission essential tasks) is accomplished; such as attendance at flight safety
        meetings, waiver support, medical consultation, human factors and human systems
        integration consultation, etc. Each flying unit (to include Remotely Piloted Aircraft
        squadrons) should be well aware of who their medical consultant is within the OSM
        structure (the on-call clinic flight surgeon should not be the default response). All
        medical personnel assigned to Special Tactics Units must meet the clinical requirements
        outlined in Table 4.1 Mission Ready Clinical Currency Requirements for SOFME/Other
        Operational Medical Personnel.
AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    53


         6.1.2.1.1. AFSOC flight surgeons will provide direct patient evaluation and medical
         care in the aerospace medicine clinic setting. IDMT/NREMT-Ps will provide
         paraprofessional support in the aerospace medicine clinic setting as outlined in the
         4N0X1 CFETP. Flight Surgeons and IDMT/NREMT-Ps will also perform aerospace
         medicine administrative functions (aeromedical waivers, shop visits, safety reviews,
         etc.) while in-garrison. These activities directly contribute to the readiness of AFSOC
         personnel. Furthermore, these activities sustain clinical proficiency and clinical
         currency skills that are required during deployment operations.
         6.1.2.1.2. Monthly duty schedules will be developed and published for operational
         medical personnel. Duty schedules will ensure that operational medical personnel
         meet all requirements contained herein. The schedule will be provided to host
         MTF/CC, SGH and SGP. Host MTF will ensure patients, examination rooms,
         surgical slots, etc., are scheduled for operational medical personnel.
         6.1.2.1.3. AFSOC operational medical logistics personnel and Medical Service Corps
         (MSC) officers will ensure deployable medical equipment and supplies are constantly
         ready for immediate deployment. Additionally, the medical logistics POC for each
         operational medical element will coordinate with the host MTF medical logistics
         section to ensure proper calibration, maintenance and repair of medical equipment.
  6.1.3. AFSOC MSCs assigned or attached to operational medical elements will directly
  participate in mission planning as the primary medical planner. Operational medical
  personnel will participate in mission “train-up” and mission rehearsal as required.
  6.1.4. Operational medical personnel will assist the host MTF regarding predeployment
  preparation and readiness of AFSOC personnel. IAW USAF policies/instructions/directives
  the host MTFs retains primary responsibility for medical readiness for all assigned personnel;
  however, AFSOC operational medical personnel will assist.
  6.1.5. Operational medical personnel not assigned to SOWs/installations with an AFSOC
  MTF will review, track and maintain Preventive Health Assessments and Individual Medical
  Readiness (PIMR)/AFCITA mobility requirements, assist in pre-/post-deployment medical
  screening/interviews, and coordinate with host MTF force health management regarding
  assigned AFSOC members. In these instances, AFSOC operational medical personnel will
  report PIMR data to the appropriate AFSOC unit commander(s).
  6.1.6. Operational medical personnel (Doctor’s/Nurses/Tech’s) will assist host MTF with the
  administration of immunizations to deploying AFSOC forces, after completing the
  immunization backup technical course.
  6.1.7. ST medical director is responsible for medical oversight of assigned AFSOC PJs.
  However, during deployed operations, the senior AFSOC flight surgeon is responsible for
  AFSOC PJ medical oversight if ST medical director is not present.
  6.1.8. All flight surgeons that are attached to a specific flying squadron or special tactics unit
  will develop an ongoing relationship similar to SME flight surgeons that are directly assigned
  to an operational squadron. Each flight commander and group surgeon will publish a
54                                                       AFSOCI48-101 30 NOVEMBER 2012


     periodic letter listing where each flight surgeon is attached and forward it and any periodic
     revisions to their respective WG/OG, AFSOC MTF/SGP, HQ AFSOC/A3 and HQ
     AFSOC/SGP. (T-3).
