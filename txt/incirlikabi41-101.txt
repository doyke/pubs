INCIRLIKABI41-101 25 JULY 2012                                                                   7


  to ensure the proper PAD is purchased. This will ensure continuity in the maintenance of the
  PADs. The goal is for the 39 ABW to have one type of PAD approved by the PAD Program
  Director and the 39 ABW/CC. All 39 ABW PADs will be logged into DMLSS by the
  MEMO.
  3.2. Maintenance:
     3.2.1. The 39 MDG BMET will conduct annual maintenance, address any mechanical
     problems found by the site coordinators, and inspect all PADs after their use on a victim.
     After an event, BMET will download the event recording from the PAD (if applicable)
     and offer a temporary loaner PAD, if available. Any PAD maintenance repair costs will
     be assessed by BMET and charged to the unit. The Medical Logistics flight will work
     closely with unit PAD coordinators if a PAD is recalled.
     3.2.2. Units are responsible for reporting non-operational units to local BMET (676-
     6507). If a device is reported as non-operational, local BMET will assess the status of the
     device.
         3.2.2.1. If it is determined that the fault is the result of operator error, the BMET will
         notify the PAD Program Training Coordinator of the possible need for refresher
         training. Any calls of this nature will be coded as a ―no problem found‖ work order
         in the DMLSS system to track and trends.
         3.2.2.2. If the fault is not operator error and the unit is still under warranty, the
         BMET will coordinate with the manufacturer, or their designated dealer, to return the
         unit for error or replacement.
             3.2.2.2.1. If the latter is determined to be the preferred course of action, MEMO
             must be notified to ensure that the proper DMLSS system transactions are
             completed.
         3.2.2.3. If the unit is no longer under warranty, the local BMET must determine if the
         unit can be repaired in-house or if the device should be sent to the manufacturer.
             3.2.2.3.1. All costs associated with the repair will be borne by the account bearer
             of the PAD.
             3.2.2.3.2. All actions and cost will be recorded in the DMLSS system.
             3.2.2.3.3. In accordance with the Safe Medical Device Act, all equipment errors
             must be reported to the FDA (Federal Drug Administration). The reporting

  3.3. Location: The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early defibrillation. Therefore,
  PADs must be strategically placed throughout the organization based upon the time to initial
  shock of a victim of SCD. PADs should be placed in facilities to ensure timely response for
  a medical emergency. Factors considered in determining 39 ABW approved locations for
  PAD placement included the following:

Terms
Automated External Defibrillator (PAD)— A defibrillator device that is: 1) commercially
distributed in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 2) Capable of
recognizing the presence or absence of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, and is
capable of determining, without intervention by the user of the device, whether defibrillation
should be performed. 3) Able to deliver an electrical shock to an individual upon determining
that defibrillation should be performed.
Basic Life Support (BLS)— A training program that teaches basic CPR techniques as well as
PAD use.
Cardio—Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) – The act of providing respiratory ventilation and
heart (cardiac) compression by an external source. This most commonly is provided to an
individual who is without both spontaneous respiration and heartbeat and it is provided by
someone capable of performing the required mechanical action.
Defibrillation— The application of an electric shock, via a defibrillator, directly through a
person's chest.
Emergency Medical Services (EMS)— The term used to describe the rapid response team of
medically trained personnel to provide emergency medical assistance as necessary.
Federal Building— A building or portion of a building leased or rented by a federal agency,
which includes buildings on military installations of the United States.
Harm— For purposes of this document, this term may include physical, non-physical, economic
and non-economic losses.
Perceived Medical Emergency— When circumstances exist whereby the behavior of an
individual leads a reasonable person to believe that the individual is experiencing a life-
threatening condition that requires an immediate medical response.
Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia— An abnormal cardiac rhythm that is incompatible with
life if not immediately treated (hereafter referred to as cardiac arrest).
Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD)— The term used to describe an abrupt cessation of normal
cardiac function that typically results from ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular
tachycardia with rapid progression to death if not immediately treated.
Ventricular Fibrillation— An abnormal cardiac rhythm that is incompatible with life if not
immediately treated (hereafter referred to as cardiac arrest).

               TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) INFORMATION

A11.1. What is TSR?
   A11.1.1. The primary goal of TSR teams is to foster resiliency in those exposed to
   potentially traumatic events. TSR teams (1) serve as trauma response consultants to unit
   leaders; (2) prepare personnel likely to be exposed to potentially traumatic events; and (3)
   provide screening, education, psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to
   potentially traumatic events. This document also provides revised training guidance.
A11.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR service?
   A11.2.1. Many types of events have the potential to produce individual and community
   traumatic stress. Events include: large scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.)
   and small scale disasters (suicide, death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence
   event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after traumatic events to help those who have
   experienced the events. The goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with
   the normal stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended to minimize the
   impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A11.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services?
   A11.3.1. The office of record for TSR services is the Mental Health Support Center.
   A11.3.2. TSR services may be requested by the effected Unit Commander/Functional Unit
   Director. The services provided may vary depending on the nature of the mishap and the
   needs of the individuals involved in the mishap. In general, the Commander of any unit that
   incurs loss of personnel or significant injury to personnel as a result of a mishap should
   consult with a TSR team leader to determine whether there is a need for TSR support. TSR
   services are collaborative between the effected Unit Commander/Functional Unit Director
   and the TSR team chief.
A11.4. How do we contact the TSR Team?
   A11.4.1. The TSR Team is contacted by calling the 39th Air Base Wing Command Post at
   DSN 676-9920/9921/9922 and asking to be transferred to the Mental Health Professional on-
   call.
