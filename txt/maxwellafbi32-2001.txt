This instruction implements AFPD 32-20, Fire Protection. It establishes responsibilities and
procedures for the Egress and Rescue Proficiency Training Program required for fire department
personnel. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and are disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force AFRIMS Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at
https://webrims.amc.af.mil/RDS/index.cfm. It applies to the Fire Department, 908th Airlift

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This change: incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2005-1; changes the OPR; removes the 54th
Airlift Flight (1.2.1, 1.3); adds Civil Air Patrol-United States Air Force (CAP-USAF) (1.2.1,
1.3); and replaces references to C-21 with Cessna (1.2.2).

1. Responsibilities.

   1.1. The base Fire Chief is responsible for the overall administration of the egress and rescue
   proficiency training program and:

       1.1.1. Decides personnel training needs.

       1.1.2. Evaluates and improves training on a continuing basis.

   1.2. The Assistant Chief for Training:

       1.2.1. Coordinates with 908 AW Plans and Scheduling for C-130 training requirements
       and with CAP-USAF/XOV for Cessna training requirements. The requirements are
       requested no later than the 15th of the month prior to the scheduled training month.
       These requirements will include the type of aircraft, crew requirements and date, time
       and length of training. At least one crew extraction exercise for each mission-assigned

       aircraft is conducted quarterly and exercises conducted during darkness are conducted
       semiannually.

       1.2.2. Ensures that realistic training is accomplished. Firefighters will be fully dressed in
       protective clothing and equipped with breathing apparatus. Breathing apparatus will not
       be worn on the flight deck of a C-130 or anywhere inside a Cessna during egress and
       rescue proficiency training exercises. Firefighters who are designated to enter a C-130
       flight deck or a Cessna during an exercise will wear the breathing apparatus to the aircraft
       and remove it prior to entering. The breathing apparatus will be placed in a safe location
       so as not to cause a hazard to other personnel participating in the exercise.

       1.2.3. Ensures a comprehensive pre-exercise briefing is held (except for unannounced
       exercises) using AFTO Form 88, Aircraft Prefire Plan, AFTO 00-105E-9, Aerospace
       Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency Services), training
       aids, and lesson plans.

       1.2.4. Ensures a post-exercise critique is conducted that covers both positive areas and
       areas needing improvement.

       1.2.5. Ensures proper documentation for training is completed and recorded.

    1.3. The 908 AW and CAP-USAF:

       1.3.1. Provide a full complement of aircraft members, fully suited in their appropriate
       flight and survival equipment for realistic training.

       1.3.2. If available, provide aircraft as outlined in 1.2.1. This is reflected in the weekly
       and monthly maintenance schedule (908 AW only).

       1.3.3. Ensure the aircraft is configured for the fire department exercise.

       1.3.4. The 908 AW provides annual training to the fire department on C-130 egress and
       escape systems.

2. Frequency of Training. Rescue proficiency training is conducted at the frequencies
specified in AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program.

3. Evaluation. The assistant chief for training or senior fire official (SFO) evaluates each
exercise. Training is not considered complete unless a satisfactory level of proficiency is
demonstrated. Follow-on sessions are scheduled as determined by the SFO or assistant chief for
training.

4. Records and Reports.

    4.1. The Automated Civil Engineer System – Fire Department (ACES-FD) program is used
    by the fire department to record rescue proficiency training to ensure all required fire
    department personnel receive continued training.
