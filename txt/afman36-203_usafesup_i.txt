                                            Chapter 1

                               AFFIRMATIVE EMPLOYMENT

1.1. Principles for Filling Positions. Positions may be filled from any of the following sources
consistent with the priorities established herein and subject to the requirements of other pertinent
Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Department of Defense (DoD), and AF procedures or
special employment programs. AF installations must observe the requirements of the Federal
Equal Employment Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP) when filling positions to include
the following:
     1.1.1. Inservice placement of current AF employees, including the career management
     program
     1.1.2. Transfer or appointment of employees from other federal agencies
     1.1.3. Reinstatement or reemployment of eligible former federal employees
     1.1.4. Other appointments, including appointments from OPM/Delegated Examining Unit
     (DEU) registers.
1.2. Availability. The availability of eligible AF employees who could be considered through
merit promotion or other inservice placement procedures does not prevent a decision to
restructure a vacant position and fill it at a different grade level. Nor does the availability of
merit promotion or other inservice candidates prevent a search outside AF for, and appointment
of, qualified and available persons.
1.3. Considerations. Affirmative action goals may be taken into consideration in consonance
with Merit System Principles, 5 USC, Section 2301.
1.4. Suitability of Candidates and Security Factors. Before finalizing a selection, the CPF
makes sufficient written and/or oral inquiries of former employers, fellow workers, and other
knowledgeable sources to evaluate the candidate's qualifications and suitability. It also initiates
required security checks on the selected candidate in accordance with governing security
regulations. The selecting supervisor appraises the candidate's general suitability before making
a final selection.
     1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE Form 16, Local Applicant Questionnaire. (T 036-27 R.
     01.00, Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, applies) Local candidates must complete the
     USAFE Form 16 to obtain additional information required to make eligibility determinations
     under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)
     with host countries before selections can be finalized. Based on provisions of the NATO
     SOFA, a person may not be a part of the “civilian component” if a citizen of the host country,
     or regardless of citizenship, if “ordinarily resident” in the host country. Those not eligible
     for the “civilian component” are only eligible for employment as “local labor” under
     employment conditions established for local national personnel (that is, pay, benefits, etc.).
     United States (US) laws require that pay and various other employment conditions of US
     citizens must be according to those laws, regardless of duty location. The only way to
     comply with both the SOFA and US law is not to employ US citizens who are not eligible to
     be a part of the “civilian component.”
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                            7


      1.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) In determining if a person is ordinarily resident in the host
      country; consider the primary reasons and motivation of why the person moved into the
      host country, and the circumstances under which the person remained. Use the guidance
      on the USAFE Form 16 to assist in this determination. CPFs may also seek advice from
      their local staff judge advocate. Each completed USAFE Form 16 should be forwarded
      to the Air Force Personnel Center Career Field Employment Division Overseas Team for
      assistance with determination during the employee pre-appointment phase.
      1.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Management may choose to perform suitability
      determinations during the pre-selection process. If this does not occur, management is
      responsible for providing local CPS candidate information in order for the servicing
      specialist to perform suitability determinations.
1.5. Qualification Requirements.
   1.5.1. Normally the OPM establishes or approves qualification requirements for positions in
   the competitive service. Qualification standards prescribe the minimum experience, training,
   education, and physical requirements, or otherwise specify required knowledge, skills, and
   abilities (KSAs) necessary for successful performance in the position. Local determination of
   physical ability or accommodation is used for all positions that do not require a medical
   examination, i.e., positions not covered by specific medical standards, physical requirements,
   or a medical evaluation program. Qualification standards will be uniformly applied for like
   positions and maintained as a record for OPM and AF evaluation and quality assessment.
   1.5.2. The CPF establishes qualification requirements for AF positions in the excepted
   service, subject to any applicable restrictions and conditions, as prescribed in OPM
   directives, AF supplements, and by DoD and AF career programs. The OPM competitive
   service requirements for similar type positions are used as a guide for establishing standards
   for excepted service positions.
      1.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) For USAFE             installations,   AFPC   is   responsible   for
      establishing qualification requirements.
   1.5.3. When an employee is affected by reduction-in-force (RIF) or has become physically
   incapacitated for continuance in his or her present position, a waiver of qualifications or
   appropriate accomodation should be considered in accordance with prevailing rules and
   regulations. A waiver of qualifications or special accomodations should be agreed to by all
   parties, the CPF, supervisor, and, when proper, the medical officer before assignment to a
   vacancy.
      1.5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) AFPC should be included in the qualification waiver process.
1.6. Referring and Selecting Candidates.
   1.6.1. Because of the requirements to observe the priorities established by law, regulation
   and other higher authority outlined in this manual, the CPF, servicing center, and/or the
   career program determines the eligibility of candidates for consideration and identifies those
   to be referred.
   1.6.2. When contacting eligibles for consideration, recruiting officials and selecting
   supervisors should provide complete information regarding duties, working conditions,
 8                                              AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


     availability of local community services, and all other matters needed for the prospective
     employee(s) to make a decision.
        1.6.2.1. Position descriptions will be presented accurately and without misrepresentation.
        Positions may not be described in such a way as to discourage interest or solicit
        declinations.
        1.6.2.2. Selecting officials and supervisors may not make firm, tentative, or implied
        com-mitment to any candidate without first obtaining clearance from the CPF.
            1.6.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) AFPC should also be included in correspondence/
            coordination prior to management making any type of employment commitment.
     1.6.3. The authority for personnel management is usually delegated to the lowest practicable
     level of supervision. However, when training, employment, or promotion patterns in an
     organization indicate that the principle of equal employment opportunity may not have been
     fully observed, the commander may withdraw selection authority and assign it to higher level
     supervisor(s) pending the outcome of an inquiry.
1.7. Employee Requests for Position Change. The servicing CPF will determine when a need
exists to accept an employee's request to be moved to a different position at the same or lower
grade based on such factors as available skills in the work force, mission requirement, or planned
staffing activities.
     1.7.1. (Added-USAFE) This is normally accomplished with applicant applying via
     USAJOBS.
1.8. Prompt Release of Employees. An employee is not restricted from accepting a position
offer from another AF activity or federal agency, or from accepting another position within an
activity for which the employee is properly referred and selected. The supervisor releases an
employee promptly to another position on the same installation, usually within 20 calendar days
after receiving notice of the employee's selection. An extension of up to 10 days may be
requested to train a replacement if the delay does not jeopardize the employee's transfer or
movement to another position (see para 2.19).
     1.8.1. (Added-USAFE) Employees are not to be unnecessarily retained after acceptance of
     any other job offer.
     1.8.2. (Added-USAFE) For acceptance of positions outside the local commuting area,
     release dates are to be negotiated between the gaining and losing supervisor in compliance
     with all pre-employment requirements. Releases should be accomplished in a reasonable
     timeframe.
1.9. Assisting the New Employee. The supervisor and the CPF have a joint responsibility for
providing information and assistance to the new employee. An employee who is moved to a
different geographical area should be given pertinent information about the new locale, such as
information on housing, schools, transportation, local community services, etc. The CPF should
develop procedures to provide help to the new employee moving from a different area.
1.10. Referral and Selection Priorities. Table 2.3, Referral and Selection Priorities,
establishes the order of priorities that are observed when filling competitive service vacancies at
continuing activities. They apply to excepted service position vacancies to the extent applicable.
For this purpose, a vacancy does not exist when an occupied position is:
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                               9


   1.10.1. Reclassified because of a change in classification standards or to correct a
   classification error, provided the incumbent is to be retained in the position.
   1.10.2. Canceled and a successor position is immediately established that is to be filled by
   the incumbent through an authorized personnel action.
1.11. Special Employment Programs. Air Force activities are expected to develop special
employment programs designed to supplement the merit promotion and inservice placement
programs. These programs purposefully seek to enhance employment opportunities in such areas
as the employment of veterans, Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP),
employment of persons with disabilities, student education employment program, and spe-cial
programs for the disadvantaged. Many of these programs offer only temporary employment and
may be used to the extent funds, facilities, and capability to provide supervision and training are
available. Other programs offer, or lead to, permanent appointments. Current employees are
usually available for many continuing positions identified for such special programs. The
supervisor, in conjunction with the CPF, determines when internal candidates are considered and
when these positions are filled from sources outside the AF. Judgment is used to provide
equitable and balanced consideration of candidates from all sources, depending on the
circumstances that exist at the activity and in the employment area.
1.12. Spouses on Leave Without Pay (LWOP) Status. A spouse accompanying a transferring
AF military or civilian sponsor, and who is either in LWOP status, has competitive status, or
equivalent appointability, is entitled to compete for available positions in the new geographic
area. Consideration is given up to and including the highest grade for which qualified and
eligible. The servicing CPF will provide counseling and information about AF installations in the
new commuting area. The gaining installation will continue to counsel and to afford the
appropriate consideration for positions for which qualified.
1.13. Employees on Retained Grade and Retained Pay. Table 2.3, provides for the priority
referral specifically for employees affected by RIF, transfer of function (TOF), or reclassification
of position, who are placed on retained grade or retained pay.
1.14. Filling Positions at the GS-15 level in the Competitive Service. Except for positions
covered by career programs that specify an alternate method of identifying candidates, all GS-15
position vacancies in the competitive service, including those overseas, require AF-wide
competition unless the position is to be filled by reassignment. The vacancy announcement
conforms to the promotion plan and substantiating job analysis conducted in consultation with
management officials. The announcement contains sufficient information so as to provide the
potential applicant with adequate knowledge of the position, responsibilities, important KSAs
and training requirements, application instructions, Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) information,
and other pertinent job information. The CPF will refer employees of the activity with
repromotion entitlement for consideration according to their priority (see Table 2.3) before
issuing the vacancy announcement.
   1.14.1. Candidates for GS-15 positions are advised to file their application to the recruiting
   activity, according to the vacancy announcement. The candidate's servicing CPF furnishes all
   relevant information regarding the candidate's identification and participation in the Air
   Force Executive Leadership Development Program, Air Force Instruction (AFI ) 36-401.
10                                             AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


  1.14.2. The servicing activity first screens the qualifications of applicants against the
  quali-fication standard and other basic eligibility criteria. Candidates may be tentatively
  ranked or grouped in broad qualification categories against the job analysis/promotion plan.
  1.14.3. In the final evaluation and ranking of candidates, a panel is assembled to assess the
  relative qualifications of competing candidates. Panels are not required in cases of 15 or
  fewer eligible competitors. The Secretary of the AF establishes, appoints, and approves
  panels for positions in the Office of the Secretary. The functional chiefs (Deputy Chief of
  Staff, or Comptroller and chiefs of comparable offices) do the same for positions in HQ
  USAF. Other positions are approved by the commander of a Major Com-mand (MAJCOM)
  or comparable organization or the Commander of staff offices. These officials may request
  higher authority to establish the panel. Each panel is composed of at least three high-grade
  civilian or military members, usually GS-15 or higher grade or of equivalent rank, appointed
  on a permanent or ad hoc basis.
  1.14.4. The panel considers all candidates who meet minimum requirements. The panel also
  considers those repromotion eligibles previously referred who have further consideration
  entitlement and evaluates their qualifications against the ranking criteria in the promotion
  plan. The criteria must have breadth of scope so as to permit evaluation of the overall
  qualification of each candidate in relation to the total requirements of the position. The
  panel's evaluation is used to identify the top-ranking candidates who, in the panel's judgment,
  are highly qualified, considering such factors as, education, training and experience;
  appraisals/evaluations; job-related awards, honors, and outside activities. Before ranking or
  final selection, the panel (or the selecting official) may need to interview the leading
  candidates. When this is necessary, temporary duty travel (TDY) can be authorized for AF
  and other federal employees as provided in the JTR. The panel usually certifies 10 highest
  ranking candidates to the selecting official. Up to 15 may be certified, if meaningful
  differences cannot be made to reduce the group to a smaller number.
  1.14.5. Commanders of MAJCOMs and comparable organizations and other staff offices
  may make the selection personally, request higher authority to make the selection, or
  authorize supervisors at any level over the position to make the selection. In the Office of the
  Secretary of the AF, selections may be made by officials designated by the Secretary. In HQ
  USAF, selections may be made by directors or heads of comparable or higher organizations,
  or they may request higher authority to make the selection. The 11 WG/DPC issues
  procedures for the Office of the Secretary and HQ USAF.
  1.14.6. The specified requirements for publication of the vacancy, AF-wide consideration of
  candidates, and panel evaluation of candidates do not apply, or are modified when:
     1.14.6.1. Filling a temporary position for one year or less by an authorized
     noncompetitive personnel action.
     1.14.6.2. Filling a temporary position for one year or less through competitive promotion
     procedures or when the upgrading of a permanent, occupied position requires
     competition, provided the panel identifies and ranks all employees within the authorized
     special area of consideration.
     1.14.6.3. A position is upgraded under circumstances permitting noncompetitive
     promotion of the incumbent (see Chapter 2).
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                        11


      1.14.6.4. Management selects a previously downgraded employee eligible for
      noncompetitive inservice consideration.
      1.14.6.5. Management decides to fill the job inservice by the noncompetitive
      reassignment of an employee currently serving in another GS-15 position.

                                            Chapter 2

               THE AIR FORCE MERIT PROMOTION PROGRAM (MPP)

2.1. Policy Objectives. Air Force promotion policy is based on strict conformance with merit
principles specified in Title 5 Code of Federal Regulations, (CFR) Part 335, Promotion and
Internal Placement. This merit promotion and placement plan provides a uniform and equitable
means of referral and selection for all placement actions according to merit principles under
merit promotion procedures. A sound promotion program, properly administered and fully
supported by managers and employees at all levels, is essential to the staffing of an effective and
highly motivated civilian work force. Identifying, qualifying, evaluating and selecting candidates
must be made without regard to lawful political affiliation or non-affiliation, religion, labor
organization affiliation or non-affiliation, marital status, race, color, sex, national origin,
nondisqualifying disability, sexual orientation, status as a parent, age or other non-merit factors
and must be based solely on job-related criteria according to legitimate position requirements.
Failure to adhere to equal opportunity or merit principles may compel a commander or designee
to withdraw selecting authority from a supervisor and delegate it upward. The program is
directed toward:
   2.1.1. Accomplishing mission goals by staffing positions with high quality employees.
   2.1.2. Providing career opportunities for employees and making sure that all employees have
   access to information about these opportunities.
   2.1.3. Ensuring management is aware of high quality employees who have the capacity to
   perform in more responsible assignments.
   2.1.4. Encouraging employees to be mobile in the interest of broadening their experience
   and increasing their qualifications.
   2.1.5. Ensuring employees are placed in positions for which they are best qualified.
   2.1.6. Ensuring the skills, qualifications, achievements, and promotion potential of
   employees are recognized and fairly considered in the staffing process.
   2.1.7. Encouraging employees to improve their performance and to develop their skills.
2.2. Key Principles. The following principles form the basis of the AF Merit Promotion
Program:
   2.2.1. All employees within a designated area of consideration who meet the minimum
   qualification standards and any legal or regulatory requirements imposed by OPM, or other
   authority, are considered eligible for promotion or placement.
   2.2.2. Areas of consideration within which candidates are identified to compete for
   advancement are established and adjusted as necessary to provide management with a
   sufficiently broad number of high quality candidates from which to choose and to provide
   employees with adequate opportunities to advance.
   2.2.3. Appropriate job-related criteria are applied with fairness in evaluating candidates to
   differentiate among their qualifications and to identify those best qualified for advancement.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                              15


   2.2.4. Selections must be made without discrimination for any nonmerit reason and without
   favoritism based on personal relationships or patronage.
   2.2.5. Consideration may be given to candidates from outside the AF.
   2.2.6. Consideration is given to input from employees, employee groups, and recognized
   labor organizations in developing and establishing merit promotion procedures. Promotions
   and placements into positions with known promotion potential are usually competitive.
   Promotions without competition are authorized with due consideration to recognized merit
   principles. Employees are kept informed about the promotion program, the provisions and
   procedures for promotion plans affecting them, and eligibility requirements. They are given
   full access to information about advancement opportunities and how to take advantage of
   these opportunities.
2.3. The Right to Select or Nonselect From Among a Group of Best Qualified
Candidates. Provided there are no higher mandatory placement priorities, managers have the
right and the responsibility to select from other appropriate sources, determining which is most
likely to meet mission objectives, contribute new ideas and viewpoints, and meet the Air Force
Affirmative Employment Program objectives and goals. These include, but are not limited to
merit promotion candidates. Applicants from any recruitment source external to the permanent
AF workforce may be considered independent of, concurrently, before, or after the referral of
candidates from the workforce. The Career Programs will issue competitive internal referral
certificates for all career program vacancies and an external certificate when requested. See
AFMAN 36-606 for individual career program guidance.
2.4. General Coverage.
   2.4.1. This plan applies to all appropriated fund employees occupying permanent and
   indefinite positions in the competitive service including those on Overseas Limited
   Appointments of indefinite or not to exceed five years duration because of the overseas
   rotation program. The plan also applies to employees serv-ing under excepted service
   appointments who have competitive status, and employees currently serving under Veterans’
   Readjustment Appointments (VRA) or Schedule A 213.3106(b)(6) Family Member
   Appointments whose positions are temporarily converted to the excepted service. Also
   included are employees under both competitive and excepted appointments as here described
   who are absent in military service, serving with international organizations, or in leave
   without pay status while in receipt of compensation. All aforementioned employees receive
   consideration by self-nominating for a job listed under a vacancy announcement and are
   evaluated by the Standard Automated Inventory and Referral System (STAIRS).
   2.4.2. When the area of consideration is expanded outside of DoD, this plan applies to all
   status and otherwise appointable applicants self-nominating from external sources, including
   reinstatements, transfers; those appointable under any non-competitive appointing authority
   and candidates eligible under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) of 1998.
   When considering candidates from outside the DoD for competitive service vacancies lasting
   more than 120 days, regional centers must notify the Office of Personnel Management per 5
   CFR 330.102 (b) and 5 CFR 330.707(a). Vacancies will be posted on USAJOBS.
   2.4.3. This plan applies to internal placement into all positions in the competitive service, all
   Career Program covered positions, including Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel
16                                            AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


  Systems (DCIPS) positions, and specifically designated positions in the excepted service,

     announcement.
     2.4.4.2. They have not completed 90 days of service after appointment from an OPM or
     DEU competitive certificate resulting in reassignment or change to lower grade to a
     different line of work, reassignment or change to lower grade to a different geographical
     area, or promotion.
     2.4.4.3. They are on leave without pay (LWOP) and are not expected to return to duty or
     are on sick leave pending disability retirement.
     2.4.4.4. They occupy a formal developmental position with a target grade equivalent to
     or higher than the target grade of the position being filled. (see para 2.6).
     2.4.4.5. They have a current unacceptable appraisal.
     2.4.4.6. The position requires access to sensitive information and their security clearance
     has been revoked or denied.
     2.4.4.7. They do not meet time-in-grade requirements when such requirements apply.
  2.4.5. This guidance applies to career management programs established by HQ USAF for
  specific occupation groupings and grade levels developed in consonance with governing
  merit promotion principles. The qualifications described in AFPD 36-6, Civilian Career
  Management , and AFI 36-601, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management, and
  AFMAN 36-606, Volume 1, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management and AFMAN
  36-606, Volume 2, Air Force Civilian Career Planning address program unique “best
  qualified” criteria applicable to individual career programs.
  2.4.6. Candidates Certified on OPM or DEU Certificates. Current AF employees referred on
  OPM or DEU certificates and who may be referred concurrently from an inservice referral
  list, may be selected from either list.
  2.4.7. Details. Short-term details of 30 consecutive days or less must be recorded by the
  supervisor on AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief.
     2.4.7.1. Details of 120 days or less to a position classified at a higher grade may be made
     non-competitively. Successive details beyond 120 days will be made using competitive
     procedures (Table 2.1).
     2.4.7.2. Employees are responsible to update their records to document any detail not
     covered by an official personnel action.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                             17


       2.4.7.3. The AF career programs do not approve nor process details except when the
       detail is part of a formal developmental program.
2.5. Reinstatement and Transfer Eligibles. Management may request that external applicants
be considered for higher-graded positions than currently or previously held. These candidates
must be rated and ranked under the same criteria as current AF employees and must rank among
the “best qualified” to be referred. External candidates who meet or exceed all ranking criteria as
compared to the lowest ranking referred AF candidate may be referred on a separate listing.
2.6. Formal Trainee or Apprentice-Type Positions. Employees in formal trainee or
apprentice-type positions, PALACE Acquire or Copper Cap interns must be informed in writing
at the time of their enrollment in the training program that they are excluded from consideration
up to and including the target grade of the position held.
2.7. Applicability to Positions Outside the Competitive Service.
   2.7.1. When all or a majority of the positions at an activity are in the excepted service and
   are under the same appointment authority, a MPP is established to provide a systematic and
   equitable method of selecting employees for promotions. The policies and procedures of this
   instruction should be followed to the extent practicable.
       2.7.1.1. All excepted service career program covered positions will be filled by the
       career programs according to this plan.
   2.7.2. Current AF employees in the excepted service having personal competitive status or
   serving on appointments which convey competitive status eligibility are entitled to
   consideration for competitive service positions according to this plan. These employees are
   afforded the same consideration given regular competitive service employees in terms of
   career progression and merit selection principles.
2.8. Applying Competitive Promotion Procedures.
   2.8.1. Use of competition in filling certain positions is based on requirements specified in 5
   CFR Part 335; AFPD 36-2, Employment and Affirmative Action; and AFI 36-2024, Staffing
   Civilian Positions. Determination of the use of competitive procedures will be made by the
   CPF in coordination with local management.
   2.8.1. (USAFE) Removes reference to AFI 36-2024, Staffing Civilian Positions. Reference
   should read: 2.8.1. Use of competition in filling certain positions is based on requirements
   specified in 5 CFR Part 335; AFPD 36-2, Employment and Affirmative Action. Determination
   of the use of competitive procedures will be made by the CPS in coordination with local
   management.
   2.8.2. Table 2.1 lists personnel actions that are subject to competition and those that are not.
   It also shows whether the locally established area of consideration must be used in the
   competi-tive process or whether a special area may be used. Merit promotion processing
   procedures are outlined in Table 2.2. The Civilian Personnel Officer (CPO) or designee is
   responsible for determining whether an action will be subject to competition and the extent of
   that competition. When a proposed action is not specifically covered by the table, basic merit
   principles should be applied in deciding whether to require competition. Even when the table
   exempts an action from the requirement for competition, the CPO may choose to apply the
 18                                              AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   competitive process when use of competitive procedures would be consistent with merit
   principles and would be in the best interest of management.
   2.8.3. Reemployment Priority List (RPL). Selecting a candidate from the RPL for a position
   at a higher grade than that last held in the competitive service must be made using
   competitive procedures.
2.9. Actions Not Subject to Competition. Supporting documentation citing the rule and
paragraph of the MPP that excepts competition should be annotated in the remarks section (i.e.,
Part D) of the Request for Personnel Action (RPA) used to process the action. Actions involving
career program covered positions must be approved by the appropriate policy council chair prior
to effecting the action.
   2.9.1. After all mandatory placement priorities are satisfied, an employee may be promoted
   up to and including a grade previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service
   or other merit system and from which separated or changed to lower grade for other than
   performance or conduct reasons.
   2.9.2. An employee initially selected under competitive procedures for a position with
   known promotion potential, may be noncompetitively promoted to intervening and target
   grades at management request. The employee must meet eligibility requirements for
   promotion to these grades, as well as any addi-tional qualifying criteria, e.g., satisfactory
   completion of all required training or higher-graded duties being assigned.
   2.9.3. A position change at the same grade from a position with known promotion potential
   to a position with no known higher potential may be accomplished without further
   competition.
   2.9.4. Upon exercise of restoration rights following military duty or service with an
   interna-tional organization, a former employee may be placed in any position for which
   qualified which is no higher in grade than the position to which he/she was promoted in
   absentia or because their former position was regraded during their absence.
   2.9.5. An employee must be noncompetitively promoted following reclassification of his or
   her position at a higher grade due to application of new classification standards or following
   correction of classification error if he or she meets all qualification and legal requirements for
   the position. (See Table 2.1 and Table 2.4 for appropriate action to place incumbent.)
   2.9.6. If a position is upgraded due to accretion/assignment of additional higher grade duties
   and responsibilities, the incumbent may be noncompetitively promoted provided there is
   clear evidence that the employee continues to perform the same basic functions as in the
   former position, that there are no other employees serving in similar or identical positions to
   whom the duties could be assigned, and he/she meets all qualification and legal requirements
   for promotion. In this case, there must be clear evidence that the newly classified position is a
   successor to the former and that the higher-graded position has absorbed the major duties of
   the former position. Included in this provision are employees returning from overseas,
   exercising return rights to obligated positions which have been upgraded during their
   absence. (See Table 2.1 and Table 2.4 for appropriate action to place incumbent).
   2.9.7. Employees eligible for grade retention will be selected for positions at grades up to
   and including their retained grade within the same pay system from which demoted
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                             19


   according to the priorities and policies specified in Table 2.3 and in accordance with
   procedures in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) Operations Manual, DoD Retained
   Grade Placement Program (Program R).
   2.9.8. An employee converted from an Student Career Experience Program (SCEP)
   appointment to a competitive service appointment in a career ladder may be promoted
   through the career ladder to target noncompetitively provided such provision has been
   included in the orginal SCEP training agreement.
2.10. Repromotion of Previously Downgraded Employees on Pay Retention. Employees
who are entitled to pay retention, except those in formal development pro-grams, developmental
opportunity positions, or those who accepted change to lower grade with pay retention in
response to solicitation for a hard-to-fill position, may be repromoted noncompetitively up to the
grade in the same pay system from which downgraded. Repromotion may occur as a planned
management action or when determined to be within reach for certification, after which the
employee will be given a priority referral in accordance with Table 2.3.
2.11. Areas of Consideration. The area of consideration for advertising positions covered by
this plan is determined by the local CPF, in coordination with manangement, or by the Air Force
Civilian Career Management Directorate for covered positions. Areas of consideration must be
sufficiently broad to ensure the availability of high quality candidates and may be organizational,
geographical, based on categories of positions, or a combination of these. Areas of consideration
may be extended geographically or organizationally, or both, and the extension may occur
simultaneously or successively.
   2.11.1. Determination of the area of consideration is based on such factors as availability of
   quality candidates locally, AEPP objectives and goals, short- and long-range manpower and
   skills requirements, and other factors.
   2.11.2. If expansion of the area of consideration could result in a permanent change of
   station (PCS), the gaining organization must certify that funds are available prior to the
   expansion of the area of consideration. Job announcements will indicate that PCS funds will
   or will not be avaliable. For career program covered positions, refer to AFMAN 36-606, Vol
   1.
   2.11.3. (Added-USAFE) USAFE management officials and personnel offices must screen
   candidates so the list of eligibles includes only United States nationals, does not include
   anyone ordinarily resident in the host country, and does not include anyone with dual-
   nationality. USAFE management officials and personnel offices should contact their
   servicing legal offices if there is any question about a candidate’s eligibility. Also, USAFE
   management officials will determine, prior to advertising the vacancy, whether or not it is in
   the Government’s best interest to pay PCS expenses. If payment of PCS expense is not
   considered in the best interest of the Government, and therefore not authorized, recruitment
   will be limited to the local commuting area but will include, as a minimum, all DoD
   employees in that area.
2.12. Identifying Candidates. The evaluation of self-nominated AF candidates for eligibility,
qualification and ranking will be accomplished through the automated system to identify those
eligible for promotion, reassignment, and voluntary change to lower grade.
 20                                              AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   2.12.1. Job listings may be obtained from several announcement platforms: the Air Force
   Personnel Center’s website, OPM’s USAJOBS website, AFPC’s Civilian Announcement
   Notification System (CANS), or AFPC’s Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).
   Employees may subscribe to CANS which will notify them by electronic mail when a
   vacancy has been posted. For the benefit and ease of the employees seeking new job
   opportunities, all new vacancies will be updated once a week, on the same day of the week,
   and will be posted for a minimum of five workdays.
   2.12.2. Candidates must self-nominate for consideration for positions, including career
   program covered positions, listed at their current installation or at other installations that have
   advertised an expanded area of consid-eration in the vacancy announcement. Self-
   nominations must be accomplished by the closing date of the announcement.
   2.12.3. All eligible employees who self-nominate are considered in STAIRS through a
   record review process that identifies those who are best qualified as validated by the Job
   Analysis/ Promotion Plan.
   2.12.4. Newly covered employees for whom the necessary qualifications and evaluation data
   are not yet available for ranking may be temporarily excluded from internal consideration
   pending receipt of complete record. No employee will be excluded for a period of longer than
   90 days.
   2.12.4. (USAFE) Employees are required to submit resumes for vacancy announcements.
       2.12.4.1. Newly covered employees who are not yet fully integrated into the internal
       system may be considered for promotion, reassignment or change to lower grade for
       other AF job opportunities by submitting a full resume under an external vacancy
       announcement.
       2.12.4.1. (USAFE) Employees         are   required    to   submit    resumes    for   vacancy
       announcements.
   2.12.5. The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) may refer Air Reserve Technician (ART)
   officers for vacancies whether or not they self-nominate.
2.13. Priority Referral. The order of special placement consideration and referral in filling
vacant positions will be in accordance with Table 2.3.
   2.13.1. (Added-USAFE) Order of special placement consideration and referral in filling
   vacancies will also be done in accordance with the USAFE Staffing Framework Guidance.
2.14. Job Analysis/Promotion Plan. A Job Analysis/Promotion Plan identifies specific job-
related criteria, knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs), as well as other characteristics necessary
to determine which candidates are “best qualified” for referral to a position being filled. A core
personnel document (CPD) or position description will be used as the basis for the job analysis.
Documentation of best-qualified criteria is made on the Job Analysis/Promotion Plan Template
in the Civilian Personnel Decision Support System (CPDSS).
   2.14.1. A personnel specialist and a subject matter expert normally perform the job analysis.
   The job analysis identifies major job requirements (MJRs) and essential KSAs required to
   successfully perform the duties of the position to be filled.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                           21


   2.14.2. The documented promotion plan is developed as a result of a job analysis process. It
   is an objective statement of qualification requirements, documented as STAIRS search
   criteria, against which employees are evaluated. The plan must show as a minimum the
   positions covered; documentation of the minimum qualification requirement; appropriate
   best qualified factors; selective placement factors (if used) and applicable ranking factors.
   Valid job-related evaluation criteria that extend beyond the minimum requirements specified
   by the qualification standard must be used to permit meaningful ranking of eligible
   candidates. Candidates are evaluated utilizing the ranking criteria.
   2.14.3. Career program panels or equivalent, composed of PALACE Team representatives
   and designated functional specialists, will develop standard AF-wide promotion plans, as
   applicable, for filling covered positions. The Job Analysis Panel Chair or equivalent and the
   personnel specialist supporting the respective career program will ensure that plans are
   validated and approved according to OPM. Approval authority is the policy council chair or
   Job Analysis Panel Chair, or equivalent, as designated by the career program.
       2.14.3.1. Specific career program policy councils determine the extent to which the
       promotion plans include relevant acquisition position requirements. Acquisition Corps
       membership and certification level requirements will be included in the Job
       Analysis/Promotion Plan as qualification requirements determined by the policy council.
2.15. Certification for Selection.
   2.15.1. Promotions. Normally, only the “best qualified” candidates will be referred for
   selection based upon individual qualifications and position requirements. The Job
   Analysis/Promotion Plan will provide meaningful distinctions or “rules” in the skills
   identification process in order to develop a promotion certificate. Generally, fifteen
   candidates will be referred on a certificate. For career program covered positions, up to
   fifteen best-qualified candidates will be referred including candidates earning the identical
   score as the last referable candidate. For non-covered positions, the number to be certified
   may be determined locally and sort factors may be used to refer "best qualified" candidates
   tied with the last referred candidate. When sort factors do not produce sufficient numbers of
   “best qualified” candidates for consideration, additional candidates may be referred if their
   quality of experience is indicative of successful performance of the duties of the position(s)
   being filled.
       2.15.1.1. Best-qualified candidates with requisite skills may be further identified using
       the following sort factor sequence: a) Civilian Promotion Appraisal, AF Form 860A
       Civilian Rating of Record, Appraisal Factors - Manner of Performance; b) incentive
       awards received in last 3 years; and c) Service Computation Date- Civilian (SCD-Civ).
       The Civilian Promotion Appraisal scores are applied using scores derived from
       algorithms to determine rank order.
       2.15.1.2. The qualifications described in AFPD 36-6, Civilian Career Management, and
       AFI 36-601, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management, AFMAN 36-606, Volume
       1, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management and AFMAN 36-606, Volume 2, Air
       Force Civilian Career Planning address occupation unique “best qualified” criteria
       applicable to individual career programs.
 22                                             AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   2.15.2. Competitive Employee Reassignments/Change to Lower Grade. Candidates who
   voluntarily seek reassignment or change to lower grade must self-nominate under the
   appropriate vacancy announcement and will be considered at the request of selecting official.
   Candidates are evaluated/ranked/referred in accordance with career program procedures or
   locally established procedures. Reassignment and change to lower grade candidates may be
   referred when determined to be as well qualified as referred promotional candidates. The
   number of competitive reassignment and change to lower grade candidates referred will be
   consistent with the provisions of paragraph 2.15.1.
   2.15.3. Competitive Details. The same definition of minimum area of consideration
   described in paragraph 2.11 will be used. Detailed employees are not required to meet OPM
   qualification requirements for experience, but must meet any positive education, certification
   or licensing requirements of the position. Job analysis will be used to determine which
   candidates will be referred for selection for competitive details. Paragraph 2.4.7.1 describes
   when a detail may be made noncompetitively and when details require competition. Air
   Force career programs do not process competitive details.
   2.15.4. Alternate Certification. An employee may be selected, absent full certification, if
   after the full competitive process has been accomplished, the employee has been determined
   to be among the group of “best qualified” candidates who would have been referred on a
   certificate. This provision applies to in-service placements only. Candidates for career
   program covered positions will not be referred by alternate certification process.
   2.15.5. AF recommends that candidates are listed alphabetically on referral certificates,
   however, local bargaining agreements may specify other methods of presenting candidates.
   2.15.6. Candidates selected for ART positions must meet both military and civilian
   requirements of the new position. Military qualifications will be determined by the servicing
   Military Personnel Flight (MPF).
2.16. Promotion Registers / Certificates.
   2.16.1. One-Time Registers. These are registers used to certify candidates to a selecting
   official when one or more identical vacancies are to be filled.
       2.16.1.1. All candidates referred must meet the eligibility requirements for the position
       when the certificate is issued. Candidates may be referred within 30 days of qualifying
       for shortage category positions which will be identified by the local CPF for base level
       positions or by the appropriate career program for covered positions based on prior
       experience filling the same or similar positions.
       2.16.1.2. Refer to AFMAN 36-606 Volume 1, Air Force Civilian Career Program
       Management for procedures for returning or extending career program certificates. All
       other certificates must be returned to the regional service center within 30 calendar days
       of receipt. Extensions may be approved by the chief of the AFPC/DPC Regional
       Division, by the chief of the appropriate service center, or designee.
   2.16.2. 90-Day Registers. These registers may be established when it is anticipated that
   several positions with the same title, series, grade, job specialty, and location will be vacant
   in a 90-day period.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                              23


       2.16.2.1. Employees who are within three months of attaining full eligibility for
       placement in the position will be entered on the register. These employees may not be
       certified for placement consideration until they are fully qualified and meet all eligibility
       requirements.
   2.16.3. AFRC may establish ART promotion registers for one-time referral or for indefinite
   use. If used for a prolonged period, the register must be regenerated at least every 90 days to
   consider new employees and those who may have become eligible since the last ranking to
   be considered.
2.17. The Selection Process.
   2.17.1. When a referral certificate is issued, the selecting official must, as a minimum,
   review system-generated career briefs of all those referred.
       2.17.1.1. (Added-USAFE) For USAFE, selecting officials are required to review
       resumes.
   2.17.2. Interviews. If the selecting official chooses to interview, he/she may interview one or
   more of the candidates on the certificate. It is not required that all candidates be interviewed
   but for those who are, the same interview questions will be used.
       2.17.2.1. All questions used in a selection interview must be job related and tied to KSAs
       identified in the core personnel document or job analysis.
       2.17.2.2. If some, but not all, candidates are interviewed, the selecting official must
       document the reasons for not interviewing and the method used to evaluate the remaining
       candidates (i.e., records review, supervisor inquiry, past working knowledge of the
       employee). The documentation and interview questions/responses are maintained by the
       selecting official, as locally determined.
2.18. Notifying Employees.
   2.18.1. Applicants may inquire as to the status of the vacancy refrerrals via IVRS/Web.
   Selecting officials will notify candidates of non-selection either orally or in writing.
       2.18.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Under Air Force Single Staffing Tool, AFPC sends
       automatic notification to applicants regarding status of non-selections.
   2.18.2. Nonselection of employees absent in military service or serving with international
   organizations, who have applied for consideration, must be documented. This documentation
   is retained in the nonselected employee’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF) or electronic
   record and includes the position for which considered, the candidate selected, date of
   selection, and other pertinent information.
2.19. Releasing Employees.
   2.19.1. After offers have been extended, selecting officials will arrange release dates with
   the losing supervisor and coordinate with the CPF when selections are made from the same
   installation.
   2.19.2. The gaining and losing CPFs will coordinate the effective date for selections from
   other installations with the losing and gaining supervisors and the regional service center.
 24                                             AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   When possible, the reporting date will be within 45 days of selection. Reporting to overseas
   locations may take longer than 45 days.
   2.19.3. Promotion. Employees selected for promotion at the same installation will be
   released by the losing organization so the action may be processed at the beginning of a pay
   period within 20 calendar days after selection. The action may be delayed for administrative
   reasons related to the placement (i.e., physical examination, security clearance, etc.) or at the
   employee’s request if approved by both the gaining and losing supervisors.
   2.19.4. Reassignment and Employee-Requested Change-to-Lower-Grade. The effective date
   for reassignments and employee-requested change to lower grade which do not require a PCS
   will normally be the beginning of a pay period within 20 calendar days of selection. No
   employee may be retained in his/her current position for more than 20 calendar days if such
   retention would adversely impact his/her selection. The action may be delayed for the same
   reasons and under the same conditions as specified in para 2.19.3.
2.20. Temporary Promotions. The area of consideration for temporary promotions is normally
the employees of the installation where the vacancy exists and may be further limited to an
organization. If the area of consideration is expanded outside the installation, the selected
employee may be temporarily promoted upon agreement between the gaining and losing
organizations. Table 2.5 lists the instances in which temporary promotions are authorized and
specifies the conditions and limitations that apply to each.
   2.20.1. CPFs must notify the appropriate career program of temporary promotions for up to
   120 days. Actions beyond 120 days, including extensions, require prior coordination and
   approval by the respective career program. Career programs may issue a referral certificate
   with a limited area of consideration for temporary fills that will extend beyond 120 days.
   2.20.2. Refer to AFMAN 36-606 for filling career broadener positions by temporary
   promotion.
   2.20.3. Temporary promotions for 120 days or less may be processed noncompetitively. If
   the promotion is expected to last or be extended beyond 120 days, competitive procedures
   apply. Supervisors are responsible for timely submission of extension/termination requests to
   the CPF for processing.
       2.20.3.1. Temporary promotions for a civilian deputy to a military chief’s position may
       be made for up to one year non-competitively (Table 2.5, rule 3).
   2.20.4. Temporary promotions in excess of 120 days to a grade higher than previously held
   on a permanent basis must be competitive. IAW 5 CFR 335.102(f) the total period of the
   temporary promotion may not exceed five years.
   2.20.5. Prior to the effective date of the action, employees selected for temporary promotions
   will be informed, in writing, of the temporary nature of the promotion and related conditions,
   including return to their former grades. If the employee is receiving a retained rate, he or she
   will be informed of the effect of the termination of the promotion on his or her pay.
   2.20.6. Terminating Temporary Promotion. Table 2.6 lists the placement actions that may be
   taken when terminating a temporary promotion and the conditions under which they may be
   made.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                            25


2.21. Reassignments and Changes-to-Lower-Grade Absent an Announcement.
   2.21.1. Reassignments may be processed noncompetitively to a position with no known
   promotion potential beyond that of the employee’s current position or that which the
   employee has held on a permanent basis. Reassigned employees must meet basic and
   statutory qualification requirements of the position to which they are reassigned or meet the
   requirements of an approved modification of qualifications.
       2.21.1.1. Management-Initiated Reassignments. Selecting officials may request the
       reassignment of an employee with the concurrence of the losing organization with
       coordination from the CPF.
       2.21.1.2. Management-Directed Reassignments. Management officials may direct the
       reassignment of a individual to a position within their organization or their line of
       command without referral of other candidates.
   2.21.2. Voluntary change to lower grade actions at employee’s request and with
   management coordination may be noncompetitively processed if the employee meets basic
   eligibility requirements or the requirements of an approved modification of qualifications and
   the position has no known promotion potential beyond the employee’s current grade or
   highest grade previously held on a permanent basis.
   2.21.3. Non-competitive reassignments or changes to lower grade actions to a career
   program covered position require prior coordination and approval by the respective career
   program.
2.22. Spouse Preference Candidates. Spouse preference eligibles will be referred for
consideration in accordance with DoD PPP procedures and Chapter 4 of this AFMAN. For
career program covered positions, refer to AFMAN 36-606.
2.23. Employees Entitled to Noncompetitive Priority Consideration as Corrective
Action. When the CPF or regional center finds a procedural violation, regulatory violation, or
program violation has occurred, they must process a corrective action. If the corrective action
does not include vacating the position, an employee who was not given proper consideration
because of the violation will be given priority consideration. The priority consideration will be
for any position similar to that for which proper consideration was omitted (i.e., same grade
and/or target grade) and for which the employee is qualified. The employee will be given one
priority consideration for each instance of omission. The employee will be referred to the
selecting supervisor before referral of candidates from other sources who are not entitled to
higher priority consideration. Management retains the right to select or non- select the employee.
Since selection of these employees is optional, supervisors may request additional candidates
before final decision.
2.24. Promotion Records.
   2.24.1. Promotion Plan. All AF organizations must maintain a copy of this promotion plan
   and make it available for their civilian employees and management officials.
   2.24.2. Safeguarding Promotion Materials. Information contained in automated data
   products, promotion registers, and promotion certificates may not be disclosed to
   unauthorized personnel. Promotion certificates may be electronically transmitted, faxed, e-
   mailed, presented personally, or mailed in a sealed envelope to selecting officials and

   returned to the CPF and the regional center in the same manner. Caution must be taken when
   transmitting and receiving promotion materials to ensure unauthorized personnel do not
   inadvertently gain access. Employees may not be informed of another employee’s rank order
   or assessment of qualifications against eligibility or ranking criteria.
   2.24.3. Individual Promotion Actions. Records of individual promotion actions taken under
   this plan will be maintained and disposed of according to AFMAN 37-139, Disposition of Air
   Force Records - Records Disposition Schedule.
   2.24.4. Records Maintained by Selecting Officials. Selecting officials will maintain all
   substantive documentation related to the consideration of competing candidates. This may
   include, but is not limited to, interview questions, notes on interview responses, record of
   contacts with previous supervisors of candidates, nonselection memos, notes on review of
   employee briefs or candidate résumés, and any ratings or informal rankings made on referred
   applicants or employees. Maintain this documentation for five years or until audit completion
   by OPM, whichever is sooner from the date of notification of selection/nonselection.
2.25. Promotion Information to Employees. All employees covered by this plan will have
access to a copy of the plan by requesting it from their own organization or from the CPF at their
installation.
   2.25.1. The employee or applicant, or designated representative, is entitled, upon inquiry to
   the CPF, to be informed of his/her qualifications for a specific fill action, and whether or not
   he/she is within a group of “best qualified” (when a search for candidates has been completed
   and the best qualified have been determined). However, the employee or applicant, or their
   designated representative, may not be informed of the assessment of another employee’s
   qualifications without that employee’s written permission.
   2.25.2. Employees considered under the automated system are also entitled, upon request, to
   full disclosure of the specific criteria in the job analysis/promotion plan.
   2.25.3. Upon request, the selecting supervisor must inform the nonselected candidates of the
   reasons for nonselection. The supervisor must adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act and
   may not discuss the rank order or assessment of qualifications against eligibility or criteria of
   the candidate selected or any other candidate referred.
2.26. Keeping Employees Informed. At least once annually, the local CPF will remind
employees, through published articles, of the principles and procedures outlined in this plan and
of OPM and AF directives dealing with the subject of promotion.
   2.26.1. Employee Audit of Employee Brief. New employees will be provided a copy of their
   placement information contained in system. Employees are responsible for reviewing and
   updating their records for the purpose of self nomination for positions being announced
   under this plan.
2.27. Employee Complaints. An employee, who believes his or her experience was not
properly credited, was incorrectly ranked, or that the terms of the promotion plan were not
otherwise followed, thereby depriving him/her of promotion consideration, is encouraged to
discuss his/her concern informally with the local CPF. If the issue concerns the ranking and
referral process, the local CPF may contact the regional center or the appropriate career program.
If the concern deals with the selection process, the matter should be resolved locally. If these
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                          27


efforts are unsuccessful, the employee may submit a formal grievance in accordance with
negotiated or agency grievance procedures. CPFs must keep the appropriate career program
informed of complaints concerning covered positions. Any corrective action involving career
program covered positions must receive the coordination and approval of the policy council chair
prior to final action.
2.28. Evaluation. The MPP and merit system operations under the plan will be evaluated
annually as part of HQ USAF/DPP internal program review. In addition, employee selection
procedures will be continually evaluated in accordance with 5 CFR Part 335 and appropriate
action taken when necessary.
2.29. Omissions. The guidance contained in the OPM and AF directives or policies will be
employed in all situations not specifically covered by this plan.

NOTES:
     1. The conditions in this column are met only when:
       a. The temporary promotion was initially made for 1 year, or was made for a shorter period
          but it was known at the outset the temporary promotion could be converted to permanent
          (for example, at the completion of extended sick leave of an employee scheduled for
          disability retirement).
       b. Full competitive procedures were used, including application of the standard area of
          consideration and its extension when required; application of the provisions in paragraph
          2.10 for mandatory selection of downgraded employees referred for competitive
          consideration; and notification to all eligible competitors that the temporary promotion
          could, or would, lead to permanent promotion without further competition.
     2. Notification to employee not provided in advance of temporary action should be provided
        as soon as possible after promotion is made. Absent notification termination of temporary
        promotion may be subject to procedures covered under of 5 CFR 752.401.
3. If the reason for the temporary promotion ceases to exist and the conditions of rules 1, 2, or 3
are met, the promotion may be changed to permanent by removing the limitation according to the
instructions in The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions.

                                            Chapter 3

                 DEVELOPMENTAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM (DOP)

3.1. Air Force Policy. It is AF policy to design, administer, and support advancement
opportuni-ties for lower-grade level civilian employees throughout the DoD. This program is
designed to help them reach their full potential and productivity and to fulfill the AF mission.
Employees with potential, but lacking qualifications, can be helped to become qualified for
current or projected positions through competitive selection for mission-supportive job
experience and job-related training and education. The guidance provided in this chapter is to be
implemented in concert with the AF Regionalized Merit Promotion Program (MPP). This policy
is carried out without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or mental
disability, or other non-merit factor.
3.2. Background. The Government Employees Training Act (Chapter 41, Title 5, USC) is the
legal basis for setting up training and educational programs to broaden opportunities for lower-
grade level employees. The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-
261) requires agencies to set up training and educational programs needed to develop employees’
KSAs so they may perform at their highest potential. In addition, Section 501 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974,
requires the same opportunities be afforded to employees with disabilities and eligible Vietnam
Era and disabled veterans.
3.3. Objectives. The goals of the DOP are established according to mission and organizational
needs and they are as follows:
   3.3.1. To provide the means by which the capabilities of participants are increased to the
   fullest extent possible.
   3.3.2. To provide employees with an opportunity to enter bridge or career positions through
   planned on-the-job and formal training.
   3.3.3. To increase employee morale.
3.4. Relationship with Affirmative Employment (AE). The DOP is an integral part of AE. It
can be an appropriate vehicle for consideration of women, minorities, and people with
disabilities into positions where underrepresentation exists.
3.5. General Responsibilities. The DOP requires the full commitment of commanders,
functional man-agers, supervisors, civilian personnel officers, participants and others to ensure
its success. Each strives to ensure the full use and upward progression of employees whose
performance, work history, interest, assessed potential and education can be matched with
developmental opportunities related to mission needs.
3.6. Responsibilities of Commanders:
   3.6.1. Ensure the DOP implemented in conjuction with the MPP.
   3.6.2. Ensure managers and supervisors are knowledgeable and trained.
   3.6.3. Express support and commitment to the DOP.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                              53


   3.6.4. Provide adequate resources based on availability of funds for the program including
   provisions for financial planning and budgeting.
3.7. Responsibilities of Functional Managers and Supervisors:
   3.7.1. Identify positions which may be filled through the DOP while on line with the mission
   and needs of the installation.
   3.7.2. Identify KSAs required at each step of the career ladder.
   3.7.3. Restructure positions to increase developmental opportunities.
   3.7.4. Counsel and encourage employees to apply for the DOP.
   3.7.5. Identify cost-effective training needs.
   3.7.6. Provide periodic evaluation of trainees’ performance and progression.
   3.7.7. Identify participants who are not satisfactorily progressing and discuss with the CPF
   appropriate action to be taken.
3.8. Responsibilities of the Civilian Personnel Officer or Designee:
   3.8.1. Design and implement the program.
   3.8.2. Serve as coordinator of the program.
   3.8.3. Assist functional managers and supervisors to identify positions to be filled through
   the DOP.
   3.8.4. Publicize programs.
   3.8.5. Counsel employees.
   3.8.6. Develop and implement appropriate selection procedures.
3.9. Eligibility. Applies to all US citizen employees at GS-1 through GS-8 and WG-1 through
WG-7 who are not serving under a time-limited appointment or on a position targeted to GS-9 or
above. Employees serving under excepted appointing authorities may be selected only if
appointment to the target position can be made under the same appointing authority or if the
appointing authority provides for conversion into competitive appointments.
3.10. Identification of Positions. The identification of appropriate target positions is critical to
the success of the program. To identify possible target positions suitable for developmental
opportunity consider-ation, it may be necessary to analyze the skills of current employees,
review current and anticipated position vacancies, and determine which positions lend
themselves to restructuring.
   3.10.1. Not every position that can be restructured need be included in the DOP.
   Determination of inclusion in the DOP is made by the supervisor on a continuing basis as
   vacancies become available.
   3.10.2. Once target positions, specific positions for which the employee is being trained,
   have been identified, the normal line of progression or career ladders should be established.
   Target positions should be restructured to the entry or intermediate grade levels with an
   identified final target position.
 54                                              AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   3.10.3. Target positions are normally classified as either career or bridge positions. Career
   positions are either positions which extend to GS-9 or above (usually two-grade interval
   series) or WG positions with journeyman grades of WG-8 or above; while bridge positions
   are lead-ins or provide qualifying experience for the career positions. Developmental
   opportunity usually encompasses movement from support positions, those positions which
   normally do not provide the possibility for advancement to the GS-9 or above or WG-8 or
   above level or the experience needed to progress to other positions, into bridge or career
   positions or movement from bridge positions into career positions.
3.11. Implementation.
   3.11.1. Selection for placement into a developmental opportunity position is accomplished
   through competitive methods as required by AFPD 36-2 and the MPP. Individuals may be
   selected for competitive promotions, reassignments, or changes-to-lower-grade. Candidates
   are identified through self nomination under a vacancy annoucement in conjunction with any
   number of competitive methods: job analysis followed by self-assessment, panel interviews,
   assessment centers or other job-related performance exercises; or any combination of
   methods, e.g., locally devel-oped self-evaluation criteria. The job analysis provides the basis
   for any other assessment tool used for indentification and selection of candidates.
   3.11.2. Candidates must meet basic eligibility requirements, unless training agreements are
   utilized or competitive reassignments as authorized under the general amendment to
   qualification standards. Any minimum education, license, or certification requirements must
   be met and cannot be waived. The area of consideration may be limited to major
   organizational entities (e.g., laboratories, centers, directorates, etc.) according to the MPP.
   3.11.3. Employees selected for positions identified for inclusion in the DOP are entitled to
   pay retention in accordance with governing OPM regulations.
3.12. Training Agreements. Training agreements are required when intensive training is used
as a sub-stitute for normal qualification standard requirements. Based on the delegation in
authority by OPM and DoD, bases will develop DOP training agreements including waivers of
qualification requirements, including time-in-grade, and/or one accelerated promotion. All
agreements are submitted to and approved by the installation commander or designee and are
reviewed at least annually. The training agreements must describe:
   Reason for agreement.
   Positions to be covered.
   Selection procedures.
      Length of training.
   General training plan.
   Flexibility provision for the length and intensity of training.
3.13. Formal Training Plan. A formal training plan is required for each employee on a
training agree-ment. In all other cases, a formal training plan may be used. The plan delineates
the training and devel-opmental activities required to qualify for the target position. The plan
should include the following:
   3.13.1. The KSAs needed for successful performance in the target position.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                          55


   3.13.2. Objectives related to the KSAs.
   3.13.3. Specific training and developmental activities needed to meet objectives.
   3.13.4. Flexibility provision for the length and intensity of training.
   3.13.5. Target dates for completion of objectives. Provisions for periodic evaluations.
3.14. Counseling. The CPF, in addition to supervisors, is responsible for providing
comprehensive counseling to assist employees in identifying their career goals, qualifications,
and match these with organizational needs and developmental opportunities. Counseling may be
accomplished by the servicing employee development specialist, affirmative employment
specialist, or individuals knowledgeable about staffing procedures and the MPP.

                                           Chapter 4

                     MILITARY SPOUSE PREFERENCE PROGRAM

4.1. Authority. The authority for military spouse preference is Public Law (PL) 99-145, as
amended by PL 99-661 and PL 100-180 (10 USC, Section 133 Note). This chapter implements
DoD Instruction 1404.12, Employment of Spouses of Active Duty Military Members Stationed
Worldwide. Air Force policy and procedures for military spouse preference employment in
nonappropriated fund (NAF) positions are addressed according to Air Force Instruction 34-310,
Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Program Management and Administration Procedures. This
chapter does not apply to the filling of AF Reserve or Air National Guard Technician positions.
   4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) MSP program is administered using USAFE Staffing Framework.
4.2. Military Spouse Preference Eligible. Eligibility for military spouse preference is not
warranted to the dual military couples where one spouse is discharged and desires to seek civil
service employment at the current duty station. Eligibility as a military spouse preference
applicant may be established if one of the following conditions is met:
   4.2.1. A military spouse who entered into marriage with the military member prior to
   relocating because of service under a statutory tour. Eligibility for preference does not extend
   to the military spouse unless marriage took place prior to the relocation of the military
   member to the new duty station area.
   4.2.2. DELETED.
   4.2.3. Is a spouse of a new recruit to active duty in the Armed Forces relocating to a new and
   permanent duty station after completing basic and advanced individual training at one or
   several temporary duty stations.

   duty station where all of the initial entry training was received.
   4.2.5. Is a spouse of a former military member placed directly within the permanent unit of
   assignment without undergoing initial entry training.
   4.2.6. Is a spouse of a member of the National Guard who has been called to active duty
   under the provisions of Title 10. In this instance, military spouse preference applies only if
   the spouse has relocated as a result of the activation of the National Guard military member
   sponsor under Title 10.
4.3. Applicability of Military Spouse Preference. The following are instances in which
military spouse preference is not applicable:
   4.3.1. Positions in the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelligence Agency
   (DIA), or other organizations in the DoD Components that have a primary function of
   intelligence, counterintelligence, or national security, including Defense Civilian Intelligence
   Personnel System (DCIPS) positions.
   4.3.2. Professional educator positions with the Department of Defense Dependent Schools
   (DoDDS). Spouse applicants for DoDDS educator positions with this system are given
   preference according to DoD Directive 1400.14, Salaries and Personnel Practices
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                          57


   Applicable to Teachers and Other Employees of the DoD Overseas Dependents’ Schools
   System.
   4.3.3. Full performance level competitive or excepted service positions covered by
   mandatory mobility agreements.
   4.3.4. IAW the PPP Operations Manual, Chapter 14(f)(2), fill actions when such actions
   would adversely impact ongoing affirmative employment Equal Employment Opportunity
   (EEO) programs; that is, when programs for achievement of minority and gender equality,
   programs for persons with disabilities, or programs for affirmative employment of veterans,
   including disabled veteran appointments and Veteran Readjustment Act Appointments
   (VRA) would be adversely affected.
   4.3.5. Situations involving statutory or regulatory entitlements; that is, placement
   entitlements stemming from reemployment rights, grade retention rights, or rights conferred
   by court and administrative decisions.
   4.3.6. Filling of positions when statutes or regulations on veterans preference or nepotism
   would be violated.
   4.3.7. Filling of positions when a placement would result in the displacement of a current
   employee of the activity (i.e., conversion to career conditional of VRA).
   4.3.8. Filling of positions when placement of a military spouse would prevent placement of
   an overseas returnee registrant of the DoD PPP or a PPP Priority 1 or 2 registrant.
   4.3.9. A sponsor’s move when the move is a PCS that is in conjunction with retirement or
   separation.
   4.3.10. At the new duty location, when a military spouse is placed on either a DoD
   appropriated or NAF position, whether or not preference was applied.
      4.3.10.1. (Added-USAFE) IAW DoD Memo, 1 December 2004, preference is only
      used for NAF if employee is selected and working in position designated as “regular”
      NAF position.
   4.3.11. DoD employment following non-DoD Federal agency employment in a continuing
   position at the new duty location.
4.4. Scope.
   4.4.1. Worldwide for spouses of active duty military members of the US Armed Forces
   applying and referred for certain appropriated fund positions in the excepted and competitive
   services in the DoD Components for all GS and FWS positions.
   4.4.2. Reciprocally across DoD Component lines for positions in the same commuting area
   as that of the new duty station of the military member sponsor.
   4.4.3. Spouses eligible for preference should be included as a part of minimum consideration
   areas in the competitive placement process. Generally, the minimum consideration area will
   include all military spouses eligible for noncompetitive appointment in the competitive
   service.
   4.4.4. Placement of military spouses through this registration does not entitle the spouse to
   relocation expenses under the DoD JTR or retained grade or pay, unless otherwise entitled.

4.5. Employment Information and Assistance. Employment information and assistance will
be made available for spouses seeking employment. This includes information provided as a part
of a coordinated effort with the Individual Newcomer Treatment and Orientation (INTRO)
program staff members and with the Family Support Center spouse employment assistance
section. As a minimum, lists of currently established positions should be readily available for
review by spouses as an indicator of employment possibilities or recruiting requirements.
Applications from eligible military spouse preference candidates must be submitted to and
accepted at the CPF based on current and projected position vacancies.
   4.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Replaces the original input with the following. Employment
   information and assistance will be made available for spouses seeking employment. This
   includes information provided as a part of a coordinated effort with the Airman and Family
   Readiness Center Newcomer Orientation programs, staff members, and with the Airman and
   Family Readiness Center employment assistance section. All military spouses in the USAFE
   theater are considered external applicants and must apply via automated system.
4.6. Claim for Preference. The CPF must advise the military spouse of the entitlement to claim
spouse preference for DoD established positions. Military spouses must be advised of various
application procedures and encouraged to apply under all appropriate options. In advising the
military spouse, the following information should be conveyed so that there is no doubt as to the
intent of the program:
   4.6.1. Spouse preference shall be limited to the specific position(s) for which applied.
   4.6.2. Spouse employment preference may be exercised once for each permanent relocation
   of the sponsor to an active duty location.
   4.6.3. Declination of a continuing position for which the spouse has requested preference
   will serve to remove a claim for preference for DoD positions in the commuting area of the
   sponsor’s duty location.
   4.6.4. Military spouse preference applies when the spouse has been determined to be among
   the “best qualified” for the position to which referred.
   4.6.5. Except for those military spouses reached for placement under Direct Hire Authority
   or from an OPM register, including OPM registers maintained under a DEU or Specialized
   Examining Unit (SEU) provisions, military spouses may be considered as preference eligible
   only if the grade of the position to which referred is no higher than a grade previously held
   on a permanent basis.
   4.6.6. Military spouses may be considered concurrently for a number of positions. For
   example, the military spouse on LWOP may be eligible for competitive promotion
   consideration, and may also be eligible as a spouse preference candidate for a grade no
   higher than previously held on a permanent basis.
   4.6.7. The military spouse should be advised to claim preference according to personal
   employment eligibility as follows:
       4.6.7.1. Eligible AF employed military spouses, spouses employed by other Federal
       agencies, spouses with competitive service reinstatement eligibility and spouses eligible
       for appointment under E.O. 12721, Eligibility Of Overseas Employees For
       Noncompetitive Appointments, desiring consideration at new AF location or other DoD
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                          59


      activities will claim preference through the procedures established in DoD 1400.20-1-M,
      Department of Defense Program for Stability of Civilian Employment, Appendix F
      (Program “S”). Eligibles include current Federally employed spouses, spouses with
      competitive service reinstate-ment eligibility, and spouses eligible for appointment under
      E.O. 12721. Required documentation may include an up-to-date employment application,
      a copy of the military sponsor’s PCS orders, and documentation confirming appointment
      eligibility.
      4.6.7.2. Military spouses without civil service status and without eligibility under E.O.
      12721 may also exercise military spouse preference. An available veteran may not be
      passed over to select a nonveteran, nor may an available military spouse preference
      eligible be passed over to select a nonspouse preference eligible. Military spouses should
      be advised of the following:
          4.6.7.2.1. If certification will be from an OPM register, from an OPM SEU or DEU
          register, or under Direct Hire Authority, the military spouse must notify and present
          proof of appointment and preference eligibility to the CPF. A copy of an up-to-date
          employment application, a notice of rating, and the military sponsor’s PCS orders
          confirming relocation to the new active duty station, are the basic documentation
          necessary to enable the military spouse preference determination.
          4.6.7.2.2. In foreign areas, the employment of spouses is governed by DoD
          Instruction 1404.12, Employment of Spouses of Active Duty Military Members
          Stationed Worldwide, January 12, 1989, and DoD Instruction 1400.23, Employment
          of Family Members of Active Duty Military Members and Civilian Employes
          Stationed in Foreign Areas, May 12, 1989. Spouses may exercise preference through
          local Applicant Supply File (ASF) procedures as a competitive service eligible or a 5
          CFR 213.3106(b)(6) Schedule A appointee. The spouse must notify the CPF of his or
          her intent to claim spouse preference when applying under the appropriate vacancy
          announcement through internal self-nomination process or established application
          procedures as they apply to non-AF candidates. Overseas commands may establish
          procedures including documentation requirements to facilitate the consideration of
          spouse preference candidates. Spouse preference may be exercised no more than one
          time per permanent relocation of the sponsor.
          4.6.7.2.2. (USAFE) Replaces the original input with the following. In foreign areas,
          the employment of spouses is governed by DoD Instruction 1404.12, Employment of
          Spouses of Active Duty Military Members Stationed Worldwide, January 12, 1989,
          and DoD Instruction 1400.23, Employment of Family Members of Active Duty
          Military Members and Civilian Employes Stationed in Foreign Areas, May 12, 1989.
          Overseas commands may establish procedures including documentation requirements
          to facilitate the consideration of spouse preference candidates. Spouse preference may
          be exercised no more than one time per permanent relocation of the sponsor.
             4.6.7.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Spouses exercise preference by self-nominating
             for vacancies via OPM USAJOBS.

   4.7.1. Verification of Spouse Status. Military spouses who entered into marriage prior to
   relocating to the sponsor’s new active duty location must be identified as the spouse of a
   military member relocating under a statutory tour. For those military spouses who acquire
   command sponsorship accord-ing to the provisions of paragraph 4.2.2, a copy of the local
   Commander’s approving statement, in addition to a copy of the military member sponsor’s
   PCS orders, will serve to verify the status of the spouse preference candidate.
   4.7.1. (USAFE) Reference to 4.2.2 was removed due to AFMAN 36-203 update 8 June
   2006. Subsequent references are also deleted. Replaces original input with the following.
   Verification of Spouse Status. Military spouses who entered into marriage prior to relocating
   to the sponsor’s new active duty location must be identified as the spouse of a military
   member relocating under a statutory tour. For USAFE, AFPC, and if required, CPS have
   overall responsibility for making spouse preference determinations.
   4.7.2. Time Period of Preference.
       4.7.2.1. In the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, and other Territories and Possessions
       of the US, the time period of military spouse preference eligibility begins 30 days before
       the military sponsor’s reporting date to the new location, and applies without time
       restriction, except that spouses seeking preference with less than six months time
       remaining in the area will not be given military spouse preference.
       4.7.2.2. For foreign areas, the military spouse preference candidate may file an
       application for employment 30 days before anticipated arrival; however, spouses may not
       receive preference until actually reporting to the foreign area CPF. Spouses seeking
       preference with less than six months time remaining in the overseas area will not be
       given military spouse preference.
   4.7.3. Employment Eligibility. The military spouse must be eligible for employment
   according to 4.6.7 of this chapter.
   4.7.4. Qualification Determination. The military spouse preference eligible must meet the
   minimum qualification standards and other basic eligibility criteria and must have been
   determined to be within the best qualified group before being referred as a military spouse
   preference eligible.
4.8. Documenting Preference. Initial preference determination will be annotated on the
application form. When the military spouse is employed based on spouse preference, the
Standard Form (SF) 50, Notification of Personnel Action, will cite the second authority code
and authority according to the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions at
http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.htm.
4.9. Applying Preference.
   4.9.1. Noncompetitive Referrals. Noncompetitive selections and placements may be made
   without application of military spouse preference; that is, reassignment, change-to-lower-
   grade, transfer (reassignment and change-to-lower-grade), noncompetitive repromotion,
   placement to RPL entitlement or OPM Interagency Placement Program (IPP) requirement,
   and placement to satisfy ongoing EEO programs according to paragraph 4.3.4.
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                            61


   4.9.2. Application Procedures. Positions filled through open competition must be listed and
   applications must be accepted from military spouse preference applicants. A spouse
   preference candidate must apply for consideration by the closing date of the announcement.
   4.9.3. Competitive Referrals. When competitive procedures are used and the position will be
   filled through open competition, military spouses eligible for appointment or assignment who
   have been determined to be military spouse preference eligibles must be considered.
   4.9.4. Targeted Positions. When filling targeted positions, the preference applies at the
   permanent target grade of the position to be filled. When application is based on prior civil
   service employment eligibility, the target grade must be no higher than the highest grade
   previously held in the Federal service.
   4.9.5. Applicant Rating and Referral. The military spouse preference eligible is rated in
   relation to competitive candidates for the position. Military spouse preference eligibles who
   rank equal to or higher than the lowest ranking referable candidate are considered to be in the
   best qualified group. If the spouse is among the best qualified, he or she will be referred to
   the selecting supervisor in advance of other competitive candidates. If selection is to be made
   from the competitive recruitment source, a referred military spouse preference eligible must
   be selected. If the CPF is unable to contact the spouse after reasonable attempts to verify
   availability, the spouse may be nonselected and the certificate must be documented
   accordingly. If more than one spouse preference candidate is in the best qualified group, the
   selecting official may select any of the spouse preference candidates.
   4.9.6. Career Program Positions. When qualified non-AF spouse preference eligibles apply
   for positions covered by career programs, a copy of the military spouse’s application which
   has been evaluated according to qualifying series and skills along with the most recent
   appraisal, will be sent to the appropri-ate career program PALACE Team at the Air Force
   Force Personnel Center Civilian Career Management Directorate accompanying the request
   for the certificate of eligibles. CPFs must notify the Air Force Force Personnel Center
   Civilian Career Management Directorate of the availability of a currently employed AF
   military spouse preference eligible and forward a copy of the preference eligible’s placement
   and experience history brief. The AF military spouse does not have to be registered in the
   career program to receive preference (see Air Force Manual 36-606, Air Force Civilian
   Career Management, Chapter 1, Section 1.18.1.1.).
       4.9.6.1. (Added-USAFE) All military spouses receive consideration via application
       process in USAJOBS.
4.10. Exception to Spouse Preference. Exceptions may be made to the selection of a military
spouse preference eligible. The authority to approve such an exception is delegated to the
Commander to whom the appointing authority is delegated at the location where application is
made. That authority may be redelegated to the CPFs. An exception should be rare and based
only on compelling hardship to the mission or to the non-spouse preference applicant.
   4.10.1. (Added-USAFE) Exceptions to family member preference will follow the same
   criteria/procedures
4.11. Spouse Preference Registrations and Documentation Requirements. The losing and
gaining CPFs are jointly responsible for PPP Program “S” or the DCPDS category M1 (if AF)
special placement registration of the military spouse. The registering CPF and the CPF

   the area of consideration could result in a PCS, the gaining organization must certify that
   funds are available prior to the expansion of the area of consideration. Job announcements
   will indicate that PCS funds will or will not be available. For career program covered
   positions, refer to AFMAN 36-606, Vol 1.
   4.11.5. Any other documentation necessary to support a claim for military spouse
   preference. The registration record must be retained for a two-year period following deletion
   as a military spouse preference eligible for that duty location assignment.
   4.11.6. (Added-USAFE) USAFE applies Spouse Preference via application to specific job
   announcements and in accordance with USAFE Staffing Framework. USAFE does not use
   ASARS automated system for application of spouse preference.

                                           Chapter 5

                  EMPLOYMENT OF EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS

5.1. Authority. Policies and procedures for requesting, approving and employing experts and
consultants in AF by appointment with or without compensation are based on 5 USC 3109 and
DoD Directive 4205.2, DoD Acquiring and Managing Contracted Advisory and Assistance
Services (CAAS).
5.2. Employment of Experts and Consultants Mission Statement. The use of experts and
consultants is a means of availing the AF of temporary and intermittent services of highly
specialized individuals to accomplish mission requirements which cannot be obtained from in-
house personnel or by other appointments. The authority can be revoked for misuse.
   5.2.1. Employment of Consultants. When essential to the mission, services of a consultant
   may be obtained to secure specialized opinions or professional or technical advice that does
   not exist or is not available within the AF or DoD; outside points of view to avoid a limited
   judgment of critical issues; knowledge of developments in industry, university, or foundation
   research; opinion of noted experts whose national or international prestige can contribute to
   the success of important projects; or citizen advisory participation in developing or
   implementing government programs that, by their nature or statutory provision, call for such
   participation. A consultant is assigned to operational activ-ities only in rare and unusual cases
   when this is the only way he or she can obtain information needed to formulate specific
   advice or recommendations.
   5.2.2. Employment of Experts. When essential to the mission, services of an expert may be
   obtained when expertise does not exist or is not available to perform work of a specialized
   nature. These services may be obtained for a temporary or intermittent period. An expert
   performs the intermittent or temporary work in an operational activity which may include
   some advisory services. An expert possesses superior qualifications and a high degree of
   attainment and standing in a professional, scientific, technical, or other field. His or her
   attainment is such that he or she usually is regarded as an authority or as a practitioner of
   unusual competence and skill by other persons in the profession, occupation, or activity.
5.3. Authority to Employ Experts and Consultants by Appointment. All appointments and
reap-pointments must be approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Requests must be
submitted through MAJCOM channels to HQ USAF/DPPH for processing.
5.4. Conditions of Employment. Appointments are limited to the specific period for which the
need for the employee’s services exist. They cannot extend beyond 365 calendar days (a service
year) from the date of the initial appointment. New appointments may be made at the expiration
of 365 calendar days. Appointments initially made less than 365 calendar days may be extended
to the end of that period.
   5.4.1. Actual Workdays. The maximum number of workdays which may be authorized
   within 365 consecutive calendar days by initial appointment or reappointment is 130. If less
   than 130 workdays is initially authorized, additional workdays may be authorized by
   extending the initial appointment. If appointment is extended beyond 130 workdays, the
   employment becomes temporary.
 64                                              AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   5.4.2. Compensation Granted. Compensation for experts and consultants cannot exceed the
   daily rate for the maximum payable rate of GS-15. The rate of compensation is set by the
   selecting official with assistance from the servicing CPF. The rate of compensation is based
   on: the value and importance of the services performed; the person’s experience and
   attainments; and the rate of compensation that may be set on a hourly or daily basis as a
   precondition of employment. If a daily rate is established, the expert or consultant is paid that
   rate regardless of the number of hours worked during the day. If an hourly rate is established,
   the expert or consultant is paid only for the hours worked; however, the actual compensation
   paid cannot exceed the maximum authorized daily rate. Overtime, night differential, holiday,
   or premium pay benefits are not applicable to experts or consultants.
   5.4.3. Without Compensation. An expert or consultant may be employed without
   compensation. Each such expert or consultant must sign a waiver of compensation to protect
   the Government against future claims for services rendered. A waiver must be executed
   before the services are rendered. A waiver is kept as a permanent record in the OPF.
   5.4.4. Security Requirements. An expert or consultant is subject to the investigative and
   clearance requirements of DoD 5200.2, DoD Personnel Security Program and AFI 31-501,
   Personnel Security Program Management.
5.5. Concurrent Use of Expert or Consultant by Air Force Activities. The services of an
expert or consultant may be needed and used by several AF activities. An AF activity may use
the services of an expert or consultant of another activity without making a new appointment as
long as the nature of the duties performed, the compensation to be paid, and the conditions of the
employment are similar. In these circumstances arrangements may be made with the appointing
AF activity so that the additional service is reflected in the person’s appointment documents and
records of service rendered, and the funds for compensation paid can be transferred between
activities.
5.6. Responsibilities. The Director of Personnel Force Management, HQ USAF/DPP, and the
Directors of Civilian Personnel at major command level are responsible for assuring all requests
meet the requirements of 5 USC 3109. Installation commanders with appointing authority are
responsible for providing leadership in the establishment and enforcement of AF policies.
5.7. Employment Procedures . At the time of the initial appointment the selecting official:
determines the need and propriety of using the expert’s or consultant’s services and
accomplishes DD Form 2292, Request For Appointment or Renewal of Appointment of
Consultant or Expert; prepares a RPA; prepares a detailed statement of work, indicating that the
appointee will only be assigned the duties for which the appointment is made (information must
be described in enough detail to determine that establishing a regular civil service position is not
practical); obtains a resume or employment application, Personal Qualification Statement (or
equivalent employment application); furnishes a description of the circumstances substantiating
impossiblility or impracticability to obtain equally qualified applicants through other methods
such as detail, promotion, reassignment of personnel (civilian or military) within the organization
or activity concerned or recruitment under civil service procedures; provides a statement of
employment and financial interests and other determinations required by DoD 5500.7, Joint
Ethics Regulation, such as DD Form 1787, "Report of DoD and Defense Related Employment,"
SF 450/OGE 450, “Confidential Financial Disclosure Report” and SF 278, "Public Financial
Disclosure Report," January 1991; submits the request along with the SF 450/OGE 450 and SF
AFMAN36-203_USAFESUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                        65


278, DD Forms 1787 and 2292, to the appropriate manpower, budget, and legal offices for
determinations as required by DoD 5500.7, Standards of Conduct , before sending the RPA and
accompanying documentation to the CPF.
5.8. Recording Days of Work. The selecting official maintains a current record of the days and
hours worked by each expert or consultant so this information can be provided to the CPF when
the employee terminates. This is not required if payroll records provide this information.
5.9. Termination of Appointments. When the work of an expert or consultant is completed,
the selecting official immediately requests termination of the appointment on the RPA. Offices
using such services must make sure that the appointee does not work more than the total number
of days authorized by the appointment. Before the appointment expires, the management official
determines whether to terminate the appointment or to request an extension or reappointment.
Request for reappointment should be sub-mitted to HQ USAF/DPP at least 120 days prior to
expiration of appointment.
5.10. Annual Communication Requirement. 5 CFR Part 304 requires that agencies comply
with the statutory requirements of 5 USC 3109 and guard against violations and inappropriate
use of the appoint-ing authority. HQ USAF/DPP will communicate this caution at least annually
through electronic mail, or memorandum. Public Law 102-378 amended 5 USC 3109 to require
each agency to report to OPM annually on the number of days worked and the amount paid to
each expert or consultant. DCPDS is used to generate supporting data for the management of the
employment of experts and consultants program, whenever possible.
