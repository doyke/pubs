        recurring demands by the quantity turned in.
 12                                                            AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013


            c. When the item turned in is a Deficiency Report
            exhibit, use supply condition code Q and action taken
            code C. For Deficiency Report credit policy, see the
            materiel deficiency procedures.
 Notes:
 1. Action taken code D is used to indicate an item was 1) bench checked at a forward operating
 base, dispersed operating base, or en route base, 2) found to be unserviceable, and 3) transferred
 to a main operating base or home base for repair. If a turn-in input contains a supplementary
 address in positions 45-50, action taken code D will cause the item to be shipped to that
 address. Do not use code D for turn-in of items with
 Expendability/Recoverability/Repairability/Cost Designator (ERRCD) XB, and do not use it
 when shipping unserviceable items to Inventory Managers, special repair activities, or other
 official depot level repair functions.
 2. Under the conditions listed below, items turned in with other action taken codes will be
 shipped to other Air Force bases and the code will be automatically changed to D.
 a. Override record address. When the override record correlates with the shipment exception
 code, the item is shipped to the override record address.
 b. Reparable destination address. When the reparable destination/ disposition code contains an
 address, the item is shipped to that address.
 c. Missing address reject. When the turn-in does not direct a shipment to another Air Force
 base, an invalid action taken code reject will be generated.
 3. Action Taken Code 8 forces the automatic shipment of items to AFMC depots. Do not use it
 with ERRCD XB items; do not use it for shipment to repair facilities other than AFMC; and do
 not use it when the Inventory Manager directs the return of an awaiting parts (AWP) asset for
 lack of parts.
        2.3.2.9. ACTIVITY CODE (1-position A). Identifies the method that an organization
        uses when submitting an issue or turn-in request to the supplies and equipment manager.
        This code appears in the first position of an organization document number. The activity
        codes are listed below:

Table 2.4. Activity Codes.

F             Internally assigned to the local manufacturer receipts of stock funded (budget
              code 9) items. For transaction identification codes (TRIC) other than receipts,
              this code is the service code portion of the MILSTRIP document number.
              Also, the organizations and/ or LRS/Materiel Management Activities use this
              code for miscellaneous DO NOT POST transactions. Such transactions are not
              processed through the SBSS but are transferred to DLADS.
J             Maintenance (IMDS/CAMS- FM) issues.
K             Retail outlet transactions. General outlet (BSS/TIC) uses this code for issues
              and turn-ins.
L             Bulk issue point (Base Service Store, Individual Equipment Element, and GSA
              Self-Service Store).

              or in-use detail records are not maintained.
R             Routine maintenance.
S             Identifies a transaction related to a supply point. It is used for across-the-
              counter issues, for turn-ins, and for action between the supply point and the
              CSB account.
U             RSP.
W             War Reserve Materiel consumables and spares.

           2.3.2.12. ADVICE CODE--REQUISITIONING (2-position A/N). Provides the
           source of supply with coded instructions that specify processing actions for programs.
           The requisition transaction advice codes flow from requisition originators to initial
           processing points and are thereafter perpetuated into passing actions and release/receipt
           documents. See DLM 4000.25-1 for a list of these codes.

        2.3.2.40. BACKORDER (DUE-OUT) CAUSE CODE. Backorder (due-out) cause
        codes identify the stock position in the retail supply system at the time a customer
        backorder is established. The due-out cause code is also used to isolate causes for
        backorders, and what action(s) is needed to prevent recurrence of the problem.

Table 2.18. Non-Stocked Item Due-Out Cause Codes.

    Cause Code        Explanation
    A                 No stock level established – First time recurring demand. No previous
                      demand or reparable generation before this request. This code is assigned to
                      change/transfer/or stop MICAP report (B9(*)) transactions by the retail
                      supply system when the type account code is E (equipment) or K (munitions).
    B                 No stock level established - Past recurring demand or reparable generation
                      experience but Air Force stockage policy precluded establishment of a
                      demand-based stock level.
    C                 Air Force stockage policy permits a demand-based stock level, but an external
                      decision by HQ AFMC has determined that stocking the item at the base
                      should be restricted. This Cause Code is also assigned when Air Force
                      stockage policy permits a demand-based stock level for the item, but only
                      non-recurring demands have occurred on the NSN.
    D                 Base decision not to stock the item. A demand-based stock level exists, but
                      the base has taken action not to stock the item such as assigning a maximum
                      level of zero.
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   25


Table 2.19. Stocked Item Due-Out Cause Codes.

  Cause Code       Explanation
  F                Full base stock - Depth of stock insufficient to meet MICAP/due-out
                   requirement.
  G                Full base stock - Quantity necessary for requirement is in AWP status.
                   The number of recoverable items in need of repair is equal to or greater
                   than the authorized stock level. Identifies repair part shortages. Assumes
                   if repair parts had been available, a serviceable asset would have been
                   available.
  H                Less than full base stock - Stock replenishment requisition exceeds
                   priority group UMMIPS standards. Focus attention on source of supply
                   processing of stock replenishment requisitions
  J                Less than full base stock - Stock replenishment requisition does not
                   exceed priority group UMMIPS standards. Additional follow-up or
                   upgrade action may be required.
  K                Less than full base stock - No stock replenishment due-in established.
                   Take action to determine the reason.
  R                Full base stock – Assets cannot be used to satisfy this requirement
                   because they are deployed, inaccessible (off-base supply point), or
                   unavailable.
  S                Less than full base stock. Stock replenishment requisition exceeds
                   UMMIPS time standards by priority group and AWP assets are on order
                   at time of MICAP.
  T                Less than full base stock. Stock replenishment requisition does not exceed
                   UMMIPS time standards by priority group and AWP assets are on order
                   at time of MICAP.
  X                Less than full base stock. No due-in established and AWP assets are on
                   hand at time of MICAP.

Table 2.20. Special Purpose Due-Out Cause Codes.

  Cause Code           Explanation
  Y                    Data not available on manually prepared MICAP Start report (B9M)
                       transactions due to the retail supply system being inoperative for
                       unscheduled maintenance.
  Z                    System/Commodity received without MICAP item (initial shortage).
                       Cause code Z identifies MICAP incidents due to a lack of initial stockage
                       at the base. This code alerts management to the problem and identifies the
                       items involved. Note: Cause code Z qualifies for one of the other cause
                       codes, but the items involved require special management attention.
  1-6                  Command unique.
  Note: Cause codes E, I, L-Q, U-W are not used.

        2.3.2.41. BASE CLOSURE/PHASEDOWN FLAG (1-position binary). Identifies
        items in the base closure or phasedown program. This flag appears on the item record
        data control field. The field will contain either a zero, indicating the base closure flag is
        off, or a one, indicating the base closure flag is in effect.
        2.3.2.42. BASE INITIATED CANCELLATIONS (5-position N). Represents the
        requisitions that have been canceled by the requisitioner. The canceled requisitions are
        listed by priority group. Such data are accumulated for one year on the routing identifier
        record.
        2.3.2.43. BASE OF PLANNED USE (3-position A/N). Identifies the exact base on
        which WRM is to be used when the base of planned use is not the reporting base. These
        codes and their definitions can be retrieved using the WRM base code list (OWBL) from
        the AFEMS (C001) on-line query (classified users only). The WRM monitor or the
        operations support branch can obtain this listing through their parent major command
        CEMO, for a description of these codes as used for FCI input.)
        2.3.2.44. BASE STOCK LEVELS. Items are generally classified as stocked and non-
        stocked. Stocked items are normally assigned demand-based stock levels that contain
        either full or less than full base stock on hand. The retail supply system makes this
        determination by comparing the serviceable property on hand to the demand-based stock
        level quantity. If the quantity on hand is less than the demand-based stock level quantity,
        the item is considered to be at less than full base stock. See Stocked Item – Full Base
        Stock and Stocked Item - Less than Full Base Stock.
        2.3.2.45. BASIS OF ISSUE (BOI) INDICATOR (1-position A/N). The basis of issue
        indicator identifies whether the basis of issue for calculation of the quantity allowed by

        codes are input for program selection purposes.
        2.3.2.48. BENCH STOCK BACK ORDER RATE (6-position N). Indicates the
        percentage derived by dividing the bench stock delayed due-outs into the line items
        authorized bench stock. Definition and use on the Organization Effectiveness Report
        (M24), for the format of the Monthly Base Supply Management Report (M32). This rate
        is determined and shown on both the M24 and the M32 as discussed below:
           2.3.2.48.1. Due-Out More Than 14 Days. Line items due-out delayed (that is, due-out
           which is greater than 14 days and which applies only to on-base organizations) should
           be divided by line items authorized bench stock.

            2.3.2.156.2.1. Code 2. Items originally established as code 7 are changed to code
            2 (by the computer) when XXR (AFMC Response From XXX Interrogation)
            response or R file processing shows a valid relationship exists between the items.
            AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity may assign code 2 with FIS
            change inputs when the item's current source code is 7.
        2.3.2.156.2.2. Code 3. Items originally established as code 7 are changed to code 3
        (by the computer) when XXR response or R file processing shows a valid relationship
        exists between the items. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity may assign
        code 3 with FIS change inputs when the item's current source code is 8.
        2.3.2.156.2.3. Code 4. Items originally established as code 7 are changed to code 4
        (by the computer) when XXR response or R file processing shows no D043B
        relationship exists between the items. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
        may assign code 4 with FIS change inputs when the item's current source code is 7.

        higher assemblies, or repair kits for one or more of the other NSNs in the ISG. Code 6
        can be assigned by AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity with FIS inputs or
        under program control from X file processing.
        2.3.2.156.2.5. Code 7. This code identifies items grouped by local Records
        Maintenance processing of FIS inputs as substitutes or complete interchangeables.
        Code 7 is temporary; it is changed to an alpha, 2, or 4 when AFMC processes the
        XXX inquiry, produced when this ISG relationship is made. Items with incompatible
        management/controlling indicative data can be used only as substitutes.
        2.3.2.156.2.6. Code 8. This code identifies items grouped as a result of MILSTRIP
        status, push due-in, or receipt processing. Assigned through the SBSS program, code
        8 is temporary; it is changed to an alpha or 3 when AFMC processes the XXX
        inquiry, produced when this ISG relationship is made. If AFMC reports an invalid
        relationship between items, that relationship will be broken under computer control.
        Code 8 cannot be assigned.
        2.3.2.156.2.7. Code 9. This code identifies D043B grouped relationships that are not
        compatible with the relationship required for base use. Note: When a relationship is
        identified as code 9, local management may find it necessary to assign other item
        record exception data to the items. For example, local management may assign the
        requisition exception (REX), issue exception (IEX), or excess exception (EEX) code.
     2.3.2.157. INTERIM SUPPLY SUPPORT (ISS). The operational turnover of a
     weapons system to the user and the establishment of an inventory control point

MPC    Description
3      HQ AFMC critical items. An RAMPS report code 5 or 7 assigned to these items
       identifies them as HQ AFMC critical.
4      Item required for forecasted base requirements. This code is assigned to repair cycle
       items when 1) the item does not meet the criteria for other codes; or 2) assets exceed the
       requisition objective and an EEX code is assigned to the item record.

7      Item excess to base requirements. Assigned to ERRCD XD and ERRCD XF items as
       follows:
       ERRCD XD items are assigned MPC 7 when 1) the serviceable balance exceeds the
       requisitioning objective, and the EEX is blank; or 2) the serviceable balance and the
       requisitioning objective are zero, a DIFM exists, and EEX is blank.
       ERRCD XF items are assigned MPC 7 when the total assets on hand exceed the
       requisitioning objective.
L      Computed supply critical item with less than 10 days on-hand stock (annual demands
       are 6 or more, percent of base repair is 50 percent or more, serviceable assets are less
       than 10 days requirements (10 x daily demand rate)) and a due-out balance
T      Computed supply critical item with less than 10 days on-hand stock (annual demands
       are 6 or more, percent of base repair is 50 percent or more, serviceable assets are less
       than 10 days requirements (10 x daily demand rate)) and no due-out balance

      analysis that takes into account remove and replace and remove, repair, and replace
      capabilities needed for maintenance procedures. Conclusions of the analysis will vary,
      depending on the requirements of a maintenance procedure. The analysis takes into
      account all requirements and procedures, including tear down, transportability, setup, and
      equipment check-out time. An A identifies RR; a B identifies RRR.
      2.3.2.173. MAJOR COMMAND CODE (2-position A/N). Identifies the command to
      which an organization is assigned.          These codes, which designate Air Force
      organizations, are the only codes authorized for loading to organization cost center
      records. This manual also refers to these codes as parent command code, using command
      code, gaining command code, and reporting command code. The codes listed below are
      just some of the major commands. Table 2.45 contains MAJCOM and agency codes*
      derived from the AFCA Table Management Distribution System (TMDS) website:

       of unit price. Used by the requirements program to determine if a demand level should be
       computed for EOQ items on the second demand without processing through COST-TO-
       STOCK COST-NOT-TO-STOCK process.
       2.3.2.196. MISSION ITEM ESSENTIALITY CODE - MIEC (3-position
       A/N). Designates the level of criticality of an asset to the mission. This code is broken
       down into: position 1 = System Essentiality, position 2 = Item Essentiality, and position
       3 = Organization Essentiality. This code is provided to the bases by the major commands.
       2.3.2.197. MISSION LIMITING INDICATOR (1-position A). A code established by
       the major commands to identify those specific equipment requirements which are mission
       limiting. Valid values are as follows:
          2.3.2.197.1. C        Critical
          2.3.2.197.2. Blank     Non-critical
       2.3.2.198. MISSION SUPPORT KIT (MSK) ITEM FLAG (1-position
       binary). Indicates on the item record that a MSK detail exists. A value of zero indicates
       that no details exist. A value of one indicates that MSK details exist.
       2.3.2.199. MOBILITY READINESS SPARES PACKAGE (MRSP) LOCATION
       CODE (11-position A/N). Identifies the physical location of the MRSP assets. Location
       codes for these details are loaded, changed, and deleted with an FCS input. There is no
       specified structure for the location code.
       2.3.2.200. MODE OF SHIPMENT (1-position A/N). Indicates the initial method of
       moving a shipment. This code is stored on the status detail record. For a list of these
       codes see DoD 4500.9-R, Part II, Appendix I.

     2.3.2.201. MONITORING AMA (IM-SSM) ROUTING IDENTIFIER (3-position
     A). Identifies the MILSTRIP routing identifier AMA (IM-SSM) responsible for
     monitoring those items shipped to a repair facility for repair and return to the Air Force
     inventory. That activity normally monitors the contractor's operation, schedules input,
     provides disposition for output, and determines distribution. See ROUTING
     IDENTIFIER CODE. Routing identifier code (RIC) information is available in
     MILSTRIP, DLM 4000.25-1.
     2.3.2.202. MULTIPLE-DIFM (1-position binary). Indicates the repair cycle assets
     that can be issued in quantities greater than one. This flag, located on the item record, is
     loaded by FCD input. A value of zero shows an issue quantity of one only. A value of
     one shows an issue quantity of more than one.
     2.3.2.203. NATIONAL ITEM IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (NIIN) (9-position
     A/N). Serves to fix the identity of an individual item of supply and to distinguish it
     concisely and permanently from all other items. The national item identification number
     occupies positions 5-13 of the NSN. NSNs are constructed with the FSC in positions 1-4,
     the NIIN in positions 5-13, and the MMAC in positions 14-15. An NIIN cannot be used
     with more than one federal supply class/materiel management code. Unlike the FSC,
     which indicates the relationship of an item to other items in the same FSC, there is no
     relationship between one NIIN and other NIIN in numerical sequence. The NIIN is a
     semi-significant number; that is, the first two positions contain the National Codification
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     61


      Bureau (NCB) code identifying the country that assigns the number. The remaining seven
      positions contain a nonsignificant serially assigned number.

      2.3.2.204. NATIONAL MOTOR FREIGHT CLASSIFICATION CODE (NMFC)
      (6-position N). Classifies items on the item record according to freight rate. The national
      motor freight classification code is also printed on shipping documents to enable
      LRS/transportation activity personnel to quickly identify the type of materiel and its
      mode of shipment. Technical assistance and guidance must be obtained from the
      LRS/Transportation activity when assigning these codes. For a complete listing, see the
      National Motor Freight Classification Guide published by the National Classification
      Board.
      2.3.2.205. NATIONAL STOCK NUMBER (NSN) (13-position A/N). An
      identification number associated with a specific item. It is made up of the FSC – 4 digits
      and the NIIN – 9 digits. A two digit Material Management Code (MMAC – 2 digits) may
      be assigned to the NSN, but it is not part of the NSN. Note: The first two digits of the
      FSC are the FSG and identify the commodity of an item. Likewise, the first two digits of
      the NIIN are the NCB Code and identify the country that assigns the number. See also
      STOCK NUMBER.
      2.3.2.206. NEW-OTHER-ASSET-FLAG (6-position A/N). Identifies on the item
      record any of six types of items by means of the following individual flags: 1) bench

     stock, 2) MSK-item, 3) overflow adjunct, 4) supply point, 5) supplemental adjunct, and
     6) mission-change-ISSL items. These six flags are explained separately in this chapter.
     2.3.2.207. NOMENCLATURE (19-position A/N). Describes on the item record those
     items which are identified by a unique NSN. Nomenclature identifies items in graphic
     and specific terms (for example, LUMBER 2X4X4X GR2, or SUIT FLY SIZE 46S).
     2.3.2.208. NONCONSUMABLE ITEM MATERIEL SUPPORT CODE.                              A
     nonconsumable item has been defined as an item of supply which is managed by one or
     more Military Services as a nonconsumable (i.e., major end item, depot reparable or
     nonstock-funded consumable). See DoD 4100.39-M, Vol 10 for a list of these codes.
     2.3.2.209. NON-STOCKED ITEM DUE-OUT CAUSE CODES (NIMSC). Non-
     stocked item backorder cause codes are assigned due to insufficient item demand history
     for computation of a demand-based stock level. Normally, non-stocked item cause codes
     consist of three general groups of items including: items with no previous demand (first-
     time) or not enough demand history; items the retail supply system has decided not to
     stock; and items management has decided not to stock. See Backorder (Due-Out)
     Cause Code for more information and explanation of each type of non-stocked item
     backorder cause code.
     2.3.2.210. NOT REPARABLE THIS STATION INDICATOR (NRTS) (1-position
     N). NRTS code 1 identifies repair cycle items that are restricted from base repair. For
     NSNs identified as NRTS-1, the phrase NRTS-1 BENCH CHECK is printed on the ISU,
     DOR, and I004 management notice. The NRTS-1 indicator is placed in the Repair Cycle
     Asset Management Listing (D23/NGV905) to allow LRS/Materiel Management Activity
     and Maintenance to speed up bench check and shipment. Reference Table 2.3 Action
     Taken Codes for NRTS items.
     2.3.2.211. NUCLEAR WEAPONS RELATED MATERIEL (NWRM) INDICATOR
     (1-position A*). Indicates a NSN is NWRM and is used to ensure NWRM visibility
     through the entire life cycle. * If NWRM, the value is Q and phrase is NWRM.
     2.3.2.212. NUMBER OF DEMANDS (1-position N). Indicates the number of times an
     item has been requested during a given period of time.
     2.3.2.213. NUMERIC PARTS PREFERENCE CODE (NPPC) (1-position
     N). Indicates on the item record why an ISG item is unsuitable and identifies the
     limitations of the item in terms of future use. When an ISG item is unacceptable for Air
     Force use or may be used only under restrictive conditions, it is assigned a numeric,
     rather than an alpha, parts preference code (see also PARTS PREFERENCE CODE). An
     NPPC (*, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 9) may be assigned by AFMC D043B ISG Update processing, by
     SNUD processing, or by FCD processing, as explained in.
     2.3.2.214. OFF-BASE FLAG (1-position A). Identifies on the Cost Center Record
     (OCCR)those activities not located on their supporting base or satellite. When this flag is
     present, the computer produces a LRS/transportation activity copy of ISU and DOR. The
     off-base flag field should be blank for those activities serviced by the supporting base or
     satellite Pickup and Delivery Section.
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    63


     2.3.2.215. ON ORDER DUE IN AMOUNT (10-position N). On the Consolidated
     Status and Transaction Statement (TABLE III/M20) the on-order due-in column reflects
     the dollar value of due ins on order at the time of the report and applied in priority
     sequence to all residual deficits remaining after application of serviceable, unserviceable
     and DIFM. The value is entered as whole dollars.
     2.3.2.216. ON ORDER DUE IN FROM MAINTENANCE AMOUNT (10-position
     N). On the Consolidated Status and Transaction Statement (TABLE III/M20) the on
     order DIFM column reflects summary dollar value of all DIFM detail quantities
     excluding those to contract maintenance. The DIFM is applied in priority sequence to all
     residual deficits remaining after application of serviceable and unserviceable, and is also
     added to the applicable unserviceable field; therefore, this column is a memo data field
     and not used in the computation for the deficit column. The value is entered as whole
     dollars.
     2.3.2.217. ON-TIME RECEIPTS BASE STANDARD (3-position binary). Indicates
     the accumulated total of all receipts received within the standard time frame for base
     order and shipping. These totals are accumulated by the computer on the routing
     identifier record.
     2.3.2.218. ON-TIME         RECEIPTS          UMMIPS         STANDARD           (3-position
     binary). Indicates the accumulated total of all receipts received within the standard time
     frame for the UMMIPS. These data are accumulated by the computer on the routing
     identifier record and are used, along with O&S days and delayed receipts UMMIPS
     standard data, to determine the average order and shipping time.
     2.3.2.219. ON-TIME STATUS (5-position N). Indicates the total status received
     within five calendar days. These data are accumulated by the computer on the routing
     identifier record for one year.
     2.3.2.220. OPERATIONAL COST RECOVERY. Those expenses attributed to the
     operation of the inventory control points. These costs are divided into two categories:
     Direct Allocatable Costs and Business Overhead Costs.
     2.3.2.221. ORDER AND SHIPPING (O&S) DAYS (4-position binary). Indicates the
     accumulated total of pipeline time for all receipts received within 175 percent of the
     standard time frame for the UMMIPS. These data are accumulated by the computer on
     the routing identifier record and are used, along with the on- time or delayed receipts
     UMMIPS standard data, to determine the average order and shipping time.
     2.3.2.222. ORDINAL DATE (5-position N). Identifies the year and day of the year.
     Positions 1-2 contain the year, and positions 3-5 contain the day of the year. For example,
     if the calendar date is June 1, 1987, the ordinal date will be 87162 (1987 = 87, June 1 =
     the 162nd day). Both the ordinal date and the Julian date identify the year and day of the
     year. The ordinal date contains a two- position year, and the Julian a one-position year
     (ordinal--87162, Julian-- 7162).
     2.3.2.223. ORGANIZATION CODE (BASE SUPPLY INTERNAL FUNCTION
     DESIGNATOR) (3-position N). Identifies an organization, unit, or detachment
     receiving logistical support from the LRS CC/AO and/or identifies internal functions of
     the LRS CC/AO. Many A&F and Supply internal program decisions are made based on a
 64                                                          AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013


       specific organization code or on a series of these codes. The organization code occupies
       positions 2, 3, and 4 of the organization document number. See Table 2.53

     processing characteristics, etc., within the theater, major commands, or bases.           2.
     Relationship to Priority and Supply Decisions. Project codes, other than OSD/JCS
     assigned codes, neither provide nor imply any priority or precedence for requisition
     processing and Supply decision-making. Therefore, project codes will never alter or
     override the priority assigned to a requisition or shipment. Requisitions containing project
     codes will be processed according to the assigned PRIORITY DESIGNATOR as
     prescribed in the UMMIPS.

        2.3.2.253. QUANTITY PURCHASE VARIATION CODE (1-position A). Used on
        Local Procurement Status (LPS) transactions to indicate why the quantity supplied by the
        vendor is not the same as the quantity requested. For codes applicable to local purchase
        items. Also, called Quantity Variation Code. This code is stored on the status detail.

Table 2.55. Quantity Purchased Variation Codes.
 Code      Description
 P         The standard unit of packaging is different from the quantity requisitioned.
           The standard package nearest the requested quantity is being purchased.
 Q         No one vendor can supply the full quantity requisitioned. Part of the
           request will be purchased from the vendor who has the largest quantity
           available. Note: If the customer still needs the unfilled quantity, contact
           the Base Contracting Office for details and submit new requisition(s).
 T         Prevents automatic decrease of the unit price on the item record for
           purchases that involve unusual circumstances such as; extra discounts, etc.
 V         Authorized variation in quantity according to FAR. For some commodities,
           Contracting may vary the quantity, not to exceed 10 percent above or
           below the requisitioned quantity.
        2.3.2.254. QUANTITY UNIT PACK (QUP) CODE (1-position A/N). Indicates the

        has a unit of issue of gallons and normal container of 55 gallons in a drum, the QUP code
        will be M. If the unit of issue for this same item is drum, the QUP code will be 1. If no
        QUP code identifies the specific unit pack quantity, the code identifying the quantity
        nearest to the unit pack will be used. The list of QUP codes is provided in DoD 4100.39-
        M, Vol 10.
        2.3.2.255. QUANTITY VARIANCE FLAG (1-position A). Also called Local
        Purchase Variance Flag. Identifies the type of variance between the quantity received
        and the original requested quantity. The use of these codes as defined below is peculiar to
        SBSS Receipt and Status processing. Also, called Local Purchase Variance Flag. This
        code differs from the 2 position coded percentage Quantity Variance used in DLM
        4000.25-5, Military Standard Contract Administration Procedures (MILSCAP) to
        identify the variation in quantity authorized by a contract.

     A/N). Indicates the type of action required for unserviceable repair cycle items which
     exceed base repair capabilities. This code, the REPR-DEST-DISPOSITION CODE on
     the repair cycle record, contains two fields. The first field (positions 1-3) is 102-
     DISPOSITION-CODE. The last field (positions 4-9) is SHIP-TO-ACCOUNT-CODE.
     The ship-to-account code is used by the computer to access the shipping destination
     record. Note: The disposition code and ship-to-account code fields will be worked by
     the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity
     personnel to reflect actions to be taken upon turn-in of the asset. Positions 1-3 contain a
     disposition code (DSP or RPT) or a blank field. If positions 1-3 contain a blank field,
     positions 4-9 will contain a ship-to-SRAN. The following chart clarifies how the
     disposition code and ship-to-account code fields are combined to indicate necessary
     actions:

              return the error transaction to the Component Registry with the required
104                                                     AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013


      transaction code in position 7 to indicate that the Component Registry is
      correct. This action will remove the reject suspense and stop any follow-up
      action.
07    Error Message: Identifies a reconciliation request submitted to the
      Component Registry that shows another reporting activity as the owner. The
      reject is included in the small arms record reject suspense file, which must
      be cleared to complete the reconciliation. Solution: Verify active/inactive
      records.

           input transaction (position 7) compatible; for example, S transaction on the
           master file will accept R transaction only.
3M         Error Message: Duplicate on serial number, NSN, and transaction code.
           Solution: Request printout from the computer by NSN and serial number
           (transaction code 3). Check the transaction to see if it is an exact duplicate.
           If it is not, correct and resubmit the transaction.
3U         Error Message: NSN and weapons serial number duplicate another weapon
           on the master file. Solution:
           a. If either the NSN (positions 8-22) or the serial number (positions 57-67)
           of the weapon are incorrect, then resubmit a correct transaction.
           b. If the NSN and serial number are correct and the weapon was received
           from the activity shown in the master file, then submit receipt R transaction
           to the Component Registry.
           c. If the NSN and serial number are correct, and the weapon was not
           received from the activity shown on the master file, then follow the actions
           for duplicate serial numbers with same NSN.

Note:
1. No TAC codes will be assigned to any ANG shipments (from or to ANG accounts) where the
DoDAAC equals F_6000 to F_6599.
2. The last digit on the TAC is 0 (zero).
3. FSC 1740, 3920 and 3950 are in both AGE and vehicles categories. The SBSS will assign TAC
F8WR for Budget Code “V” and "Y", with ERRCD NF5 and ND5 (Vehicles), and TAC F8HA for
budget codes A, M, and Y (with any other ERRCD).
4. TAC F8PD is restricted to supporting the Harvest Falcon/Harvest Eagle Program (Formerly
Southwest Asia) only.
5. All A5(x) including TRM/A5J.
6. The TAC is assigned only to those A2*/A4*/A5* where the first position of the document number
equals E or F.
  2.5. Document Identifier Code (DIC) And Transaction Identification Code (TRIC)
      2.5.1. Document Identifier Code (3-position A/N).
         2.5.1.1. Purpose. To identify external transactions (requisition, referral action, status,
         follow-up, cancellation, etc.) to the system they apply to and to indicate the purpose and
         use of the data as intended by the operation. The SBSS will recognize these codes under
         program control, select the appropriate programs, and react to the data.
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    111


     2.5.1.2. Assignment. The DOD controls assignment of the first character. Alphabetic
     characters A and B are assigned to the Supply distribution systems for MILSTRIP.
     Alphabetic characters X, Y, and Z are provided as variable codes. These variables may be
     used in any or all systems, but only under restrictive conditions.
     2.5.1.3. MILSTRIP. Document identifier codes must be entered on all requisitions and
     related products entering the Supply distribution systems under MILSTRIP, according to
     the following rationale.
         2.5.1.3.1. Position 1 assignments.
             2.5.1.3.1.1. Alphabetic A identifies transactions related to Requisitioning /Issue
             systems, regardless of service or the items within that service.
             2.5.1.3.1.2. Alphabetic B and X identify transactions related to Inventory Control
             systems within services/agencies. Each service may develop and assign these
             codes.
             2.5.1.3.1.3. Alphabetic C identifies transactions related to the Defense Logistics
             Agency's Inventory Control System.
             2.5.1.3.1.4. Alphabetic X and Y facilitate service assignment of codes to
             transactions necessary to internal depot, supply source, or base operations but not
             directly related to paragraphs above. Transactions containing codes Y and Z in the
             first position may never appear on any documents passed beyond the confines of a
             base, depot, or equivalent.
             2.5.1.3.1.5. Alphabetic D and all other alphabetics not mentioned above are
             reserved for future assignment by the Department of Defense. These codes will
             not be used by the military services or the Defense Logistics Agency until
             assigned by DOD.
         2.5.1.3.2. Position 2 assignments. The second position may contain alphabetic or
         numeric entries.
         2.5.1.3.3. Position 3 assignments. The third position may contain alphabetic or
         numeric entries. If position 1 contains alphabetic A on requisitions, referral orders,
         redistribution orders, and materiel release orders, the character in position 3 (numeric
         or alphabetic) will indicate the content of the stock or part number field. For these
         transactions, the following guidelines will apply:
             2.5.1.3.3.1. Any numeric will signify that an overseas consignee is to receive
             shipment of the materiel.
             2.5.1.3.3.2. Any alphabetic will signify that a CONUS consignee is to receive
             shipment of the materiel.
  2.5.2. Transaction Identification Code (3-position A/N).
     2.5.2.1. Purpose. To identify internal transactions within the SBSS (issue, turn-in, due-
     in, due-out, report, file maintenance, inventory, etc.), and to indicate the purpose and use
     of the data as intended by the operation. The SBSS computer will recognize these codes
     under program control, select the appropriate programs, and react to the data.

       2.5.2.2. Assignment. The possibility of misusing a DOD/AFMC document identifier as a
       transaction identifier must be avoided. For this reason, some transactions containing
       TRIC codes may never appear on any document passed beyond the limits of the Standard
       Base Supply System.
   2.5.3. Codes and Explanation. The following table lists DIC/TRIC codes used in the SBSS,
   along with titles and references where the applicable formats may be found.

    2.6.1. Purpose. To identify a document with a control and/or reference number.
    2.6.2. Assignment (14-position A/N). Document numbers are assigned to identify
    transactions throughout the logistics system. A document number will be maintained until
    retirement of the document is authorized in official reports of audit.
    2.6.3. Explanation of Formats. The format for assigning document numbers will vary
    according to the type of transaction involved. Examples below identify different formats. The
    letters used in the examples represent the following characters:
       2.6.3.1. The letter A represents an alpha character.
       2.6.3.2. The letter N represents a numeric character.
       2.6.3.3. The letter X represents an alpha or numeric character.
       2.6.3.4. The letter B represents a blank in that position.
       2.6.3.5. A character within quotation marks (" ") is a constant. The character identified in
       this section will be the character used.
    2.6.4. Item Numbered Document Numbers.
       2.6.4.1. Application. Supply point, mobility kits, WRM spares, SPRAM, and in-use. (See
       Table 2.99)

Table 2.99. Document Numbers, Example One.

           2.6.4.1.1. Shop Code. For supply point items, the shop code field will contain the
           supply point code. If the activity code is E, the shop code must be alpha/ alpha.
           2.6.4.1.2. Zeros. The Julian date of preparation is entered in this field for issues, turn-
           ins, etc., and is retained to the output. Zeros are used on file maintenance transactions
           and are stored on the detail records.
       2.6.4.2. Application. DIFM and due-outs related to bench stock, supply point, mobility
       kit, WRM spares, SPRAM, and in-use. (See Table 2.100)

Table 2.100. Document Numbers, Example Two.

           2.6.4.2.1. Shop Code. For supply point items, the shop code field will contain the
           supply point code. If the activity code is E (Equipment Management), the shop code
           must be alpha/alpha.
           2.6.4.2.2. Date. This field will contain an informal serial number on issues from a
           supply point.
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                151


    2.6.5. Serial Numbered Base Document Numbers. The following format applies to normal
    due-outs and DIFM not identified above. (See Table 2.101)

Table 2.101. Document Numbers, Example Two.

    2.6.6. Document Numbers Assigned Under Program Control for Record Maintenance
    Transactions.
       2.6.6.1. TRIC FID/FCS Transactions. These transactions are assigned document
       numbers under program control and will always contain activity code Y (file
       maintenance). Position 11 of the warehouse location (if a warehouse location applies)
       may be left blank. (See Table 2.102)

Table 2.102. Document Numbers, Example Three.
Code              Blanks             Warehouse
                                     Location

          2.6.6.1.1. Item record delete transactions (TRIC FID). Two transaction history
          records may be created for one TRIC FID transaction. One transaction history is
          created with the warehouse location in the document number field only if a
          warehouse location was present on the deleted item record. A second transaction
          history is created with the NSN in the document number field regardless of
          warehouse location (see format below). When no warehouse location is present, only
          the history containing the NSN is printed.
          2.6.6.1.2. Warehouse location change/delete transactions (TRIC FCS). Transactions
          with TRIC FCS will normally have the above document number assigned with the
          new (input) warehouse location in the document number field. However, if the input
          is a warehouse location deletion, ONLY activity code Y will be used; all remaining
          positions will be blank.
       2.6.6.2. All Other Record Maintenance Transactions. All Record Maintenance
       transactions not applicable to Para 2.6.6.1 above will be assigned a document number
       (under program control) according to the example given below. This number will contain
       activity code Y and the first 13 characters of the NSN. (See Table 2.103)

Table 2.103. Document Numbers, Example Four.

       2.6.7.1. Serial Number. Restart daily. Specific blocks of serial numbers will be allocated
       2.6.7.2. Satellite Requisitions. Due-in details and REC/SPR inputs for satellite
       requisitions may contain an alpha character in the first position of the serial number.
    2.6.8. Special Instructions. The following special instructions apply only to paragraphs
    2.6.4 through 2.6.7 above; they do not apply to document numbers for transactions between
    bases and outside agencies.
       2.6.8.1. Serial Number Assignments. Serial numbers are assigned manually, starting with
       0001 daily for each activity code. To prevent multiple assignments of the same serial
       number, the host LRS CC/AO will provide a block of serial numbers to BCE for use on
       issue requests input through the BCE Materiel Control terminal.
           2.6.8.1.1. For Contract Maintenance/in-house repair/ Deficiency Report exhibits. A
           block of serial numbers for activity code C issue requests will be provided to Asset
           Management and Weapon System Support. The Repair Cycle Support Section will
           control all other activity C issue requests and will assign the serial numbers.
           2.6.8.1.2. For Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS). The host LRS
           CC/AO will assign serial numbers 6000 through 6500 to the CEMS for issue requests.
       2.6.8.2. Item Number Assignments. Item numbers are permanently assigned for bench
       stocks, supply point stocks, EAID/in-use equipment, and WRM items. These item
       numbers are assigned when the stock is first authorized. Substitutes for EAID/in-use
       equipment items will carry the same item numbers as the authorized items for which they
       substitute.
2.7. Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability, Cost Designator (ERRCD).
    2.7.1. Purpose. To identify on the item record Air Force items according to three categories.
    2.7.2. Assignment (3-position A/N). These codes are assigned to items for management
    purposes. Items not obtained, stocked, and issued by AFMC will be assigned (ERRCD) XB3,
    XF3, or NF3, based on the nature and cost of the item.
       2.7.2.1. Expendability (position 1). The first position indicates whether or not an item
       may be consumed in use or may lose its original identity during periods of use (X =
       expendable, N = nonexpendable).
       2.7.2.2. Level of Repair (position 2). The second position indicates the HIGHEST level
       of repair allowed (B = user, F = field, D = depot).
       2.7.2.3. Cost Category (position 3). The third position indicates the cost category to
       which an item belongs. This designator is obtained from stock lists. Note: For equipment
       items (ND_ or NF__), position 3 will contain the equipment management code (see note
       2 below).
    2.7.3. Codes.

Table 2.106. EMC Codes.
Code      Description
1         An item for which base-level accounting/reporting of assets is not economical or
          practical.
2         An item assigned EMC 1 in the cataloging system for which an Air Force base desires
          visibility for local use. SBSS accounting will be maintained but will not be reported to
          the USAF Equipment Data Bank.
3         An item which requires SBSS accounting and reporting to the USAF Equipment Data
          Bank but does not justify transaction reporting. Overlay type reporting to the USAF
          Equipment Data Bank is required.
4         An item of such logistics significance that transaction reporting to the Equipment Data
          Bank is required.
5         An item requiring EMC 4 accounting/reporting except the individual assets will be
          identified by a serial or registration number.
Note:
1. In the above, INVEST/EXP indicates an item's monetary value and, in most cases, the source
of funding. Investment (INVEST) indicates an expensive item. When the LRS/Materiel
Management Activity issues these items, there will be some form of accounting for the items. In
most cases, investment items are paid for by the depot, MAJCOM, or Air Force. Expense (EXP)
indicates an inexpensive item. When the LRS/Materiel Management Activity issues these items,
no accounting is required except for XF items. Expense items are paid for with base-level funds
(organization).
2. For equipment items, the last position will contain the EMC. These codes are pushed by the
item manager, except EMC 2 which is major command directed. EMC codes apply as explained
above in Table 2.106.
2.8. Materiel Category and/or Source of Supply Code.
    2.8.1. Purpose. To indicate the lowest level of transaction data accumulation required for
    financial inventory purposes.
 154                                                        AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013


   2.8.2. Assignment (1-position A). The source of supply assigns these codes to each type
   stock record account code based on the budget code. A materiel category and/or source of
   supply code will be maintained on each inventory management record.
   2.8.3. Codes.

                   issue and free backorder/DOR of selected budget code 8 items. The
                   use of TEX D pertains to activity code X, R, J, and D issue requests
                   only. Do not use TEX D without the approval of the SMAG
                   Manager. The SMAG Manager is responsible for the complete
                   review of TEX D issues and due-outs. For AFMC-managed (budget
                   code 8) items, the Funds Manager must receive a list of selected

2.11. Type Transaction Phrase and Code (TTPC).
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     181


   2.11.1. Purpose. To provide precise identification of transactions that appears on the
   document register.
   2.11.2. Assignment (2-position A/N). Type transaction phrases and codes are assigned to
   simplify the process of identifying transactions, since several types of action can be taken on
   a single input. Without a TTPC the user must make a detailed analysis of the entire record to
   determine the type of transaction taking place. The type transaction code is printed and stored
   on the transaction history record.
   2.11.3. Codes Explanation.

2.14. Custody Receipt Account Code/Shop Code.
   2.14.1. Purpose. Identifies functions within an individual organization. The shop code and
   custody Receipt account code are synonymous within the SBSS; they are distinguishable
   only by their application. Each organization assigns and controls these codes to identify its
   own functions. These codes appear in positions 5 and 6 of the organization document number
   and must not be duplicated within the same organization. Some of these codes are required
   for specific inputs. For example, code NS must be used on FCH inputs for identity changes.
   However, this does not prevent organizations from duplicating this code for other functions.
   The following list provides suggested examples:

2.17. Excess Transaction Status Code.
   2.17.1. Purpose. Indicates either a reject or the action status and other information on an
   excess report and related documentation from the DLA/GSA and the national inventory
   control point (NICP). The S series rejects excess transactions. The T series gives information
   about the action status of excess transactions. Also, see DoD 4100.39-M.

Table 2.119. Excess Status Codes.
Code     Explanation/Processing Action
SA       EXPLANATION: Rejected. If appropriate, resubmit with exception information as
         required by the instructions distributed separately by ICP. Assign a new document
         number if a new report is submitted.
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      215


       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I107 management notice and
       deletes the detail. If re-reporting is required, process FEX with TEX code C and load
       EEC code 6 to item record, if applicable. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the
       input.
SB     EXPLANATION: Rejected. Report garbled, incomplete. Corrective actions cannot be
       determined. Review contents; correct and resubmit if appropriate. Assign a new
       document number if a new report is submitted. Also provided in response to
       MILSBILLS (DIC) FTP, Follow-up for Credit. Indicates the supply source has no
       matching document on file. Research, correct, and resubmit, if appropriate. If the
       transaction is valid, then contact the Materiel Returns POC through the DLA Customer
       Support Network, 1-877-DLA-CALL (1-877-352-2255).

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer flags the item record for releveling, creates a
       TTPC 5U transaction history, and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is
       taken on the input.
SC     EXPLANATION: Rejected. ICP of the reported item cannot be determined. Research
       records and, if applicable, resubmit citing correct NSN. (Assign a new document
       number if a new excess report is submitted). If NSN is GSA managed, item is non-
       stocked; disposition is authorized under local directives. (Use to reject invalid
       FTE/FTP transactions). (Use on FTR).

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I043 management notice and
       deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input.
SD     EXPLANATION: Rejected. NSN is not identifiable. Corrective action cannot be
       determined. Review correct and resubmit, if appropriate. (Assign a new document
       number if a new excess report is submitted.) (Use to reject invalid FTE/FTF
       transactions.) (Use on FTR.)

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is not found, the computer outputs an I044 management notice and
       deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input.
SE     EXPLANATION: FTL/FTM transaction received by the ICP identified in positions 4-
       6. FTL/FTM does not match a report of excess at the ICP or the NSN in FTL/FTM
       cannot be identified. Review, correct, and resubmit if appropriate. (Used on FTR)

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I044 management notice and
 216                                                          AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013


       deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input.
SF     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The item is not in the authorized condition to be reported
       or the condition code cannot be identified. The materiel should be screened for correct
       condition and a new FTE submitted. If the item is not reportable, it should be disposed
       of according to current procedures. If a new excess report is submitted, assign a new
       document number.

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I108 management notice and
       deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. If DLADS
       action is still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80.
SG     EXPLANATION: Rejected. This transaction is a duplicate of a previously submitted
       FTE.

       PROCESSING ACTION: This code indicates a duplicate report of excess. No action is
       taken on this input.
SH     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The unit of issue is incorrect and cannot be converted or
       corrected. Assign a new document number if a new excess report is submitted.

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs a I041 management notice and
       deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input.
SJ     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The signal code is incorrect.

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer flags the item record for releveling, creates a
       TTPC 5U transaction history, and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is
       taken on the input.
SK     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The signal code requires a compatible fund code. Assign
       a new document number if a new excess report is submitted. PROCESSING ACTION:
       Processing is the same as for status code SJ.
SL     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The dollar value of the reported excess is less than the
       minimum allowed by current instructions. Assign a new document number if a new
       excess report is submitted.

       PROCESSING ACTION: Processing is the same as for status code SJ. If DLADS
       action is still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80.
SM     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The stock balance indicates that disposal action is
       appropriate. However, the item is in the process of migrating, so further action is
       postponed until the date contained in positions 70-73 arrives. If the item is still in
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       217


       excess position after that date, resubmit to the appropriate item manager. Assign a new
       document number if a new excess report is submitted.

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer updates the follow-up date field with the
       date in positions 70-73 of the input FTR. An FTR/SM flag is also placed in the
       FTR/SM flag field of the excess detail. If the date is less than the current Julian date,
       the follow-up program deletes the excess detail and flags the item record for
       releveling, if required. If no detail is found, an FTC is output to cancel the excess
       report.
SN     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The materiel reported is not authorized for return. (Used
       on FTR.)

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I148 management notice and
       deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on this input. If DLADS
       action is still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80.
SQ     EXPLANATION: Rejected. The reported NSN is a master item number (that is, all
       makes and models) used for reference purposes only. (Used on FTR.)

       PROCESSING ACTION: Review the records and resubmit with a new document
       number, citing the appropriate NSN for the specific item being reported.
TA     EXPLANATION: Creditable return. Credit will be granted for the quantity indicated
       in positions 25-28. Ship materiel to the activity indicated in positions 54-56. (Used on
       FTR.) Note: The quantity shipped is the serviceable balance minus the requisition
       objective, but it cannot be greater than the input quantity.

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer directs the shipment of property with
       reimbursement, outputs a reimbursable shipment, creates TTPC 1A/3S and 2H
       transaction histories, creates a shipped-not-credited detail, and outputs shipment
       suspense (SSC). DD Form 1348-1A will be output on the appropriate warehouse
       terminal. The computer also attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the
       detail is found and the suffix is blank, the excess detail is deleted. If the suffix code is
       not blank, the quantity shipped is subtracted from the excess detail and the result, if
       positive, remains on file. Otherwise, the detail is deleted. If the detail is not found, an
       FTC is output to cancel the reported excess.



TB     EXPLANATION: Non-creditable return. Return the quantity indicated in positions
       25-29 to the activity in positions 54-56. (Used on FTR or FT6.) The quantity shipped
218                                                          AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013


      is the serviceable balance minus the group total requirement, but the quantity shipped
      cannot be greater than the input quantity.

      PROCESSING ACTION: The computer directs the shipment of property with no
      reimbursement, creates a shipment suspense detail, and outputs an SSC. The computer
      also attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If an excess detail is located
      and the requisition objectives is not zero, or the cumulative recurring demand is not
      zero and the DATE-SPC- ASSIGNED is less than 730 days, an FTC will be output
      and the excess report detail will be deleted from the field. (See note.) If a detail is
      found and the suffix code is blank, the excess detail is deleted and a shipping
      document is output on the appropriate warehouse terminal. If the suffix code is not
      blank, the input quantity is subtracted from the excess detail and the remainder, if
      positive, is written back on file. Otherwise, the detail is deleted. If no detail is found,
      an FTC is output to cancel the reported excess. Note: For budget code 8 (XB3, XF3)
      and budget code 9 (XB3 and NF1 - IEX 3, 6, E, K), the retention criteria will be 365
      days for mission impact code of 3, 4, or blank. These criteria are based on the DATE-
      SPC-ASSIGNED date. MIC 1 and 2 assets will use 730 days (two years) from the
      DATE-SPC-ASSIGNED date to determine the retention criteria.

TC    EXPLANATION: Not returnable. The quantity indicated in positions 25-29 is in
      excess of the authorized retention levels. Further processing must proceed according to
      appropriate service regulations. (Used on FTR.)

      PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
      detail. If the detail is found, the computer performs requirements computation to
      determine the current inventory position for the entire ISG. If the on-hand serviceable
      balance is considered total excess, and if all the processing edits and conditions
      required for serviceable transfers are, the input quantity is transferred to DLADS. If
      the detail is not found, the input is ignored. Note: See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6
      for additional processing actions for excess status code TC. The area covers the logic
      used for Materiel Returns FTR inputs when shipment action is authorized to transfer
      items to DLADS. It applies to items that are budget 9.
TD    EXPLANATION: Not returnable. 1) Special instructions for disposition are stated in
      the remarks field (continued on the reverse side). In this case, the status output will be
      submitted. Code TD will not be used when other status codes have been established to
      communicate applicable status. 2) For reasons of security or due to space limitations,
      instructions must be provided by separate communication. The communication will
      refer to the specific document number. When separate communication is to be used
      and this status code is provided, the remarks block will be blank. (Used on FTR.)
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     219


       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I039 management notice. If no
       detail is found, the computer outputs an FTC to cancel the excess. If DLADS action is
       still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80.
TE     EXPLANATION: Materiel required for lateral redistribution (Used on FTR.). TE is
       an intra-Air Force excess transaction code.

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the computer deletes the detail and no further action is
       taken. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input.
TF     EXPLANATION: Materiel received. The status is being investigated. (Used on FTR.)

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding
       shipped-not-credited detail for the input document number and suffix code. If the
       detail is found, the computer updates the date shipped field to reflect the current Julian
       date plus 30 days. This action prevents follow-up for 30 days. If no detail is found, no
       action is taken on the input.
TG     EXPLANATION: Material required for lateral redistribution A4_referral(s) will
       follow, containing NSN and/or unit of issue as changed and as indicated in positions 8-
       22 and/or positions 23-23. (Used on FTR.)

       PROCESSING ACTION: Examine unit of issue and quantity fields for possible
       changes prior to Receipt of referral order(s).
TH     EXPLANATION: Credit will be granted for the quantity in positions 25-28. The NSN
       and/or unit of issue are changed as shown in positions 8-22 and/or 23-23. The quantity
       field (25-29) is adjusted as required. Examine the unit of issue and quantity field for
       possible changes. Ship materiel to the activity in positions 54-56. (Used on FTR or
       FT6.)

       PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
       detail. If the detail is found, the input NSN is matched to the excess detail NSN. If the
       NSNs are not equal, an I040 management notice is output. If the NSNs are equal, the
       retail supply system converts the excess status code TA, but processes the transaction
       as if the excess status code is TH. If the item record unit of issue and the input unit of
       issue are not equal, a 329 reject is output. After taking corrective action as indicated by
       reject 329, the input must be reprocessed. If no detail is found, an FTC is output to
       cancel the excess report.
TJ     EXPLANATION: Non-creditable return. The NSN and/or unit of issue have been
       changed as shown in positions 8-22 and/or positions 23-23. Examine the unit of issue
       and quantity fields for possible changes. Return the quantity indicated in positions 25-
220                                                          AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013


      29 to the activity indicated in positions 54-56. (Used on FTR or FT6.)

      PROCESSING ACTION: Edits are the same as those for status code TH, while
      processing is the same as that for status code TB.
TK    EXPLANATION: Not returnable. The NSN and/or unit of issue have been changed as
      shown in positions 8-22 and/or positions 23-23. The quantity indicated in positions 25-
      29 is in excess of authorized retention levels. Examine the unit of issue and quantity
      field for possible changes. Further processing must proceed according to appropriate
      service regulations. (Used on FTR.)

      PROCESSING ACTION: Edits are the same as those for status code TH, while
      processing is the same as that for status code TC. If DLADS action is still required,
      process the TRM with an R in position 80.
TL    EXPLANATION: Materiel received. No credit allowed because the item received was
      other than that authorized for return. (Used on FTZ.)

      PROCESSING ACTION: See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M.
TM    EXPLANATION: Materiel received. No credit or reduced credit is allowed since the
      condition received was less than reported. The condition of the materiel received is
      indicated in position 71. (Used on FTZ.)

TR    EXPLANATION: Your FTF received and in process. A reply will be provided by the
      date indicated in positions 70-73. (Used on FTD.)

      PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess
      detail. If the detail is found, the follow-up date field is updated with the date contained
      in positions 70-73 of the input FTD. If no detail is found, an FTC is output to cancel
AFH23-123V1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    221

       credit was authorized for return. (Used on FTB.)

       PROCESSING ACTION: See DFAS-DE 7077.10M.
TZ     EXPLANATION: FTE has been routed to the activity indicated in positions 67-69 by
       the DASS facility identified in positions 4-6. (Used on FTQ.) The FSC on the item
       record and all details are changed to FSC in positions 8-11.

       PROCESSING ACTION: The retail supply system attempts to locate the
       corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the reported-to routing identifier is
       updated with the routing identifier code contained in positions 67-69 of the input FTQ.
       A SNUD inquiry is also output. If the detail is not found, an FTC is output to cancel
       the excess report.
T3     EXPLANATION: FTM has been received, but the materiel has not been received.
       Ship materiel, initiate tracer action, or submit FTC, as appropriate. (Used on FT6.)

           is excess IPE and must be reported to Industrial Machinery Services (IMS) (SE 4300).
           (Used on FTR.)

           PROCESSING ACTION: This code is assigned by AFMC to identify service excess
           managed by the IMS. Upon input, an attempt is made to locate the corresponding
           excess detail. If the detail is found, it is deleted and a reject 343 output. If the detail is
           not found, no action is taken on the input.
T6         EXPLANATION: Your FTE document has been routed to the activity indicated in
           positions 67-69. Forward all future documents to that activity. (Used on FTR.)

           PROCESSING ACTION: Processing actions are the same as for advice code TZ with
           the exception that the input is an FTR and was initiated by the ICP.

      negotiate as provided by LJC R are forwarded through HQ AFMC for review
      and comment prior to consideration by HQ USAF. HQ USAF approval
      authorizes negotiation only. It does NOT grant the authority to stock specific
      items or quantities. As a minimum, the requests for the authority to negotiate
      must indicate the mission, condition, and situation to be supported, the
      approximate number of items and estimated dollar value for which negotiated
      levels will be requested. LJC R may be assigned to HQ AFMC managed
      items with ERRCD XD*.
S     Base initiated adjusted levels for ERRCD XD* which do not affect the stock
      level, as when a minimum level is less than the demand level. The level of
      approval code is always B; the type of adjusted level code is always C. LJC S

      DIC will be AE9. If an ALC corrected and rerouted the requisition, the DIC
      will be AE1 or AE2.
      b. NSN. If an ALC changed the fund code and rerouted the requisition, an
      NSN has been found on which the Air Force is not a recorded user. The NSN
      found has been screened to see it meets technical requirements for AF use
      and can replace the part number originally submitted. Action is being
      initiated to record the Air Force as a user on the NSN. Appropriate changes
      have been made in Signal and Fund code (positions 51-53), and the Source
      of Supply (positions 67-69) of the requisition.

            requisition with a new document number and a current Julian date using the
            NSN (positions 8-22) and routing identifier (positions 67-69) identified on
            the status (AE*) transaction.
 FZ         Canceled. The requisition has been canceled because requisitioned items
            changed from non-marginal analysis to marginal analysis. See management
            notice F455 for more information.
 JA         Canceled. The Communications Security (COMSEC) item requisitioned was

   2.21.1. Purpose. To provide the name and number for each screen format. Almost all SBSS
   legacy transactions can be submitted through ES-S using simple web based GUI screens.
   This transaction processing capability allows authorized users to process transactions against
   one or more SBSS accounts without having to sign-on to each account separately. See ES-S
   User’s Manual.       Note: A screen feature exists on almost all of the screens to bring input
   data back on the screen after input. This feature is available whether the transaction processes
   or rejects. Position cursor at the top of the screen where the screen number is shown (i.e.,
   /083) and simply replace the slash (/) with an ‘R’ (i.e., R083). Then enter the data to be
   reprocessed. This is particularly useful when multiple inputs must be processed.

2.22. MICAP Codes.
   2.22.1. Purpose. To describe different codes utilized and reported in the base MICAP
   process. Several codes are used on MICAP report transactions to accurately reflect actions
   affecting MICAP incidents. These codes are explained and listed as follows.
   2.22.2. MICAP Cause Code. For MICAP Cause Codes, see Stocked Item Due-Out Cause
   Codes and Non-stocked Item Due-Out Cause Codes.
   2.22.3. MICAP Condition Code.
      2.22.3.1. Purpose. To explain the purpose and usage of MICAP condition codes. A

       (-) in position 14 of the NSN field. The adjunct record numbers are currently limited to -
       1, -2, and -9. An adjunct record may be an overflow adjunct or a supplemental adjunct
       record. Overflow adjunct records (-9) are used to record assets or demands that exceed
       the field length on basic records. The overflow fields are in addition to the basic record
       and are recorded in thousands (for example, 1 on the overflow record equals 1000 on the
       basic record). All processing is against the basic record; assets and demands are
       transferred by the program to and from the overflow adjunct record. Supplemental

Notes:
1. The alpha code for subclassification of classes II, VII, and IX represents materiel category
designators used in supply management, with the exception of "A" (Air) which is used
throughout all classes of supply, as applicable. Alpha codes not utilized as materiel category
designators have been assigned to the subclassifications for classes I, III, and V. The
subclassification materiel designators ("A" through "T") may be used in combination with
the designated subclassifications, when appropriate and if desired, to further definitize a
portion of a class of supply for planning purposes; that is, use of class V "AL" to designate
ammunition, air missile. Additional codes may be utilized by the services to satisfy a
specific requirement; for example, to designate reparable or nonreparable, high dollar items,
or for other selective
management purposes. This additional permissive coding is to be utilized in lieu of that
designated for the major classification and subclassifications.
2. Includes gratuitous health and welfare items.
3. Includes power generators and construction, barrier, bridging, firefighting, petroleum, and
mapping equipment.
4. Includes bearings, block and tackle, cable, chain, wire rope, screws, bolts, studs, steel
rods, plates, and bars.
5. Commercial vehicles utilized in administrative motor pools.
