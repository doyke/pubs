     must take whatever action is necessary to avoid collision, regardless of who has the right-of-way.
        1.20.1.1. When two aircraft are approaching head on, or approximately so, each shall stop or
        where practicable alter its course to the right so as to keep well clear.
        1.20.1.2. When two aircraft are on a converging course, the one that has the other on its right shall
        give way.
        1.20.1.3. An aircraft that is being overtaken by another aircraft shall have the right-of-way and the
        overtaking aircraft shall keep well clear of the other aircraft.

1.21. Traffic Control Light Signals.
     1.21.1. The following procedures are used by air traffic control towers in the control of aircraft,
     ground vehicles, equipment, and personnel not equipped with a radio. These same procedures will be
     used to control aircraft, ground vehicles, equipment, and personnel equipped with radio if radio con-
     tact cannot be established.
        1.21.1.1. Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel use a directive traffic control signal that emits an
        intense narrow light beam of a selected color (red, white, or green) when controlling traffic by
        light signals.
        1.21.1.2. Between sunset and sunrise, a person operating an aircraft on the ground wishing to
        attract the attention of the control tower should turn on a landing light and taxi the aircraft into a
        position, clear of the active runway, so that light is visible to the tower. The landing light should
        remain on until appropriate signals are received from the tower.
        1.21.1.3. During daylight hours, acknowledge tower transmissions or lights signals by moving
        the flight controls. At night, acknowledge by blinking the landing or navigation lights. If radio
        malfunction occurs after departing the parking area, watch the tower for light signals or monitor
        tower frequency.

1.22. Taxi and Towing Distances.
   1.22.1. Do not taxi or tow beyond taxiway hold lines, or within 100 feet of an active runway if there
   are no hold lines, unless previously cleared by air traffic control.
   1.22.2. Do not taxi or tow an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers monitoring
   the clearance between the aircraft and the obstruction.
      1.22.2.1. Locally based aircraft are exempt when fixed taxi routes are marked and the obstruction
      is permanent. See paragraph 1.22.2.1.3. for the definition of a permanent obstruction. This exemp-
      tion only applies to locations where aircraft are taxiing into or out of a parking spot. These criteria
      shall not be applied on taxiways or taxi lanes where aircraft do not normally park. Taxi routes
      must be used by the same model aircraft for which they were designed.
             1.22.2.1.1. The exemption and waiver authorities specified in this instruction apply only to
             existing facilities. Do not apply these criteria in the design of new facilities. UFC 3-260-1 Air-
             field and Heliport Planning and Design, establishes design criteria for new facility construc-
             tion, including waivers to design criteria.
             1.22.2.1.2. NOTE: MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no lower than WG/CC) may waive the
             requirement for 25 feet clearance in taxi lanes only, but in no case can this be waived to less
             than 10 feet between wingtips and any portion of adjacent aircraft (also see paragraph
             1.22.3.1.3.). When the waivered taxi lines require the aircraft to turn, the waiver can only be
             applied to aircraft with good visibility of the wingtips from the cockpit that do not require the
             use of judgmental oversteering for turns (ex. C-21 or most fighters).
             1.22.2.1.2. (ACC) Authority to approve taxi clearance waivers is delegated to WG/CCs.
             1.22.2.1.3. NOTE: Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a per-
             manent obstruction for purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2. through 1.22.3., provided it is parked
             entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as
             painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means. AGE or vehicles parked in these
             areas must have a parking brake set, chocks, or another suitable means to prevent inadvertent
             movement of the equipment. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent obstruction,
             provided the aircraft is parked properly in it’s designated spot and is not moving.

            1.22.2.1.4. CAUTION: When designing and marking parking areas as described in para-
            graphs 1.22.2. and 1.22.3., MAJCOMs and units must take into account the effects of wing
            and tail growth, landing gear geometry, and use of judgmental over-steering during turns, as
            applicable, to insure clearances are maintained during all phases of a turn into or out of a park-
            ing spot.
            1.22.2.1.5. NOTE: For the purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2. and 1.22.3., locally based aircraft
            include aircraft of the same type operating at another base with the same type aircraft, in park-
            ing areas specifically designed for that type aircraft. For example, a KC-135 from Grand Forks
            AFB ND operating in the KC-135 parking area at McConnell AFB KS or an F-15 from RAF
            Lakenheath operating in the F-15 parking area at Seymour-Johnson AFB NC.
     1.22.3. Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 feet to any obstruction.
        1.22.3.1. This restriction can be waived by the MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no lower than
        WG/CC) under any of the following circumstances:
        1.22.3.1. (ACC) Authority to approve taxi clearance waivers is delegated to WG/CCs.
            1.22.3.1.1. During contingency operations when compliance would restrict the mission. A
            marshaller must be used.
            1.22.3.1.2. When operating from alert, readiness, or protective shelters. A plainly visible cen-
            terline must be painted along the exit path. A marshaller must be used.
            1.22.3.1.3. Locally based aircraft when operating into and out of parking spots specifically
            designed for those aircraft and the obstruction is permanent. These criteria shall not be applied
            on taxiways or taxi lanes where aircraft do not normally park, or when environmental or oper-
            ational conditions (ice, snow, inoperative systems, etc.) may impact the normal turn perfor-
            mance of the aircraft. Taxi routes shall be clearly marked. Taxi routes must be used by the
            same model aircraft for which they were designed. See paragraph 1.22.2.1.3. for the definition
            of a permanent obstruction. Parking spots shall be spaced to allow a minimum of 10 feet clear-
            ance between any portion of adjacent aircraft. A marshaller must be used.
                1.22.3.1.3.1. WARNING: Paragraph 1.22.3. sets out minimum clearances for aircraft taxi-
                ing into and out of parking spots. These minimums may not be appropriate for all types of
                aircraft, especially large swept wing aircraft with limited visibility from the cockpit and/or
                when judgmental over-steering may be required for turning (i.e. C-5, KC-10, KC-135,
                etc.). When turns are required, MAJCOMs will establish appropriate clearance standards
                for aircraft where visibility is limited from the cockpit, judgmental over-steering is
                required for turning, or there is wing or tail growth during turns.

Section 1F (Added-ACC)—Launch and Recovery
1.23. (Added-ACC) Requirements. Launch and Recovery requirements are outlined in MDS applicable
technical orders and AFOSH STD 91-100. The crew chief briefs all assistants (when required by MDS
tech data) on their responsibilities and performs normal launch procedures. The assistant (when required
by MDS tech data) stands by the fire bottle through engine start sequence and then performs duties as
24                           AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007


directed by the crew chief. NOTE: Contracted maintenance may be exempted from this requirement;
however, personnel will use applicable aircraft launch/recovery and servicing technical data and comply
with all manpower and safety requirements.

                                     AIRCRAFT MARSHALLING

Section 2A—Standard Marshalling Signals For The Air Force

2.1. Standard Marshalling Signals. For standard marshalling signals for the Air Force, see Figure 2.1.
and Figure 2.2. All ground and aircrew personnel must use these signals to direct and control movement
and operation of aircraft on the ground. Refer to Chapter 1 for testing requirements.

2.2. AF Visual Aid (AFVA) 11-224, Aircraft Marshalling Signals. AFVA 11-224 shows marshalling
signals identical to those in Figure 2.1. and Figure 2.2. Display this visual aid where maintenance and
flight related operations take place. Suitable locations are aircraft maintenance work areas and flight line
buildings frequented by ground and aircrew personnel.
2.2. (ACC) AF Visual Aid (AFVA) 11-224, Aircraft Marshalling Signals. MTF displays a current
AFVA 11-224, Aircraft Marshaling Signals. NOTE: Not applicable to AFRC units.

Section 2B—Aircraft Marshallers.

2.3. Aircraft Marshallers. Aircraft marshallers provide hand signals to personnel taxiing or operating
aircraft on the ground.
   2.3.1. Transient alert aircraft marshallers will wear the uniform described in paragraph 2.3.1.1. Uni-
   form consistency is necessary to ensure flying personnel of one nation can readily identify aircraft
   marshallers of other nations. Individuals directly involved in fueling, defueling, and servicing liquid
   oxygen systems shall not wear the marshaller's uniform. Concurrent Servicing Supervisors are
   exempted.
       2.3.1.1. The uniform is a sleeveless garment of fluorescent international orange. It covers the
       shoulders and extends to the waist in the front and back. Wear this garment over the basic uniform
       prescribed for transient alert personnel.
       2.3.1.2. The orange garment may be marked with numbers on the front and back, at the discretion
       of the installation commander,
       2.3.1.3. During daylight hours, marshallers may use high visibility paddles. Self-illuminating
       wands are required at night or during restricted visibility.

Section 2C—Visual Marshalling Signals

2.4. USAF Visual Marshalling Signals (Pilot Initiated):
   2.4.1. Pilots will initiate all signals regarding the operation of aircraft systems, for example, speed
   brakes, flaps, etc. The marshaller (crew chief) will repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the
   aircraft system.
   2.4.2. When marshallers must stay with a moving aircraft, pilots must make sure taxi speeds allow the
   ground marshaller or signal person to keep their proper position.
26                             AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007


     2.4.3. When giving visual signals, the pilot's hands must be in clear view of the marshaller. Specific
     signals are:
        2.4.3.1. "OK." Thumbs up.
        2.4.3.2. Trim Set for Take Off. Pilot forms "T" with hands.
        2.4.3.3. Safety Pin check. Comply with technical order procedures. If the technical order does not
        specify safety pin check procedures, then the pilot must display seat pin before requesting removal
        of chocks. Marshallers must display ground safety pins before stowage.
        2.4.3.4. Armament Switches Off, Safe, or Normal Position. This signal is used during arming and
        de-arming aircraft. The pilot must verify that all armament switches are turned off and then place
        hands in clear view of the ground crew.
        2.4.3.5. Pitot Heat Check. The pilot grasps extended forefinger of left hand with right hand. The
        marshaller will give "OK" signal if the system is operating properly.
        2.4.3.6. Nose Gear Steering Check. The pilot, with hands at head level, palms toward marshaller,
        moves hands back and forth simulating movement of rudder pedals. After positive acknowledg-
        ment from marshaller, the pilot performs the steering check. The marshaller will give the "OK"
        signal if nose gear moves properly.
        2.4.3.7. Probe Check. The pilot raises arm upward and in a position resembling a probe. The mar-
        shaller will give the "OK" signal if no malfunction is observed.
        2.4.3.8. Clearance to Release Drag Chute. The pilot extends arm outward and down; alternately
        clenches and opens hand. The marshaller will:
            2.4.3.8.1. Respond with an affirmative nod if all is clear to release chute, and
            2.4.3.8.2. Give the "OK" signal when drag chute separates from aircraft.
        2.4.3.9. Clear to Lower Canopy. The pilot pats top of helmet; the marshaller pats top of head.
        2.4.3.10. Flight Refueling Door Check. The pilot places hand on top of helmet with palm down
        and fingers forward, then raises and lowers forward portion of hand to simulate door opening and
        closing. The marshaller repeats the signal to indicate clear for safe opening or closing; then gives
        an "OK" signal if operation is proper.
        2.4.3.11. Pilots may use other signals, similar to marshaller's signals in Figure 2.1. and Figure
        2.2., as necessary.
            2.4.3.11.1. CAUTION: Do not extend arms or hands outside the cockpit on aircraft config-
            ured with clamshell-type canopies unless an uplock device has been inserted.
        2.4.3.12. (Added-ACC) T-38 Launch Signals. In addition to the USAF Aircraft Marshaling Sig-
        nals, the following launch signals may be used by T-38 crews:
            2.4.3.12.1. (Added-ACC) Diverter Valve--Left hand extended palm down. Right hand
            clasped under left palm and rotated with thumb going inward and right.
            2.4.3.12.2. (Added-ACC) Rudder--Right hand extended forward from the elbow and moved
            left or right in conjunction with movement of rudder.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                         27


          2.4.3.12.3. (Added-ACC) Aileron--Both hands extended from elbow and moved up and
          down in conjunction with movement of the ailerons.
          2.4.3.12.4. (Added-ACC) Horizontal Stabilizer--Both hands extended from elbow and
          moved up and down in conjunction with the stabilizer.

2.5. International Aircraft Marshalling Signals.
   2.5.1. Where possible, signals in this instruction comply with North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   (NATO) Standardization Agreement 3117, Air Standardization Coordinating Committee Air Stan-
   dard 44/42A, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and Federal Aviation Adminis-
   tration (FAA) signals. Where there is a conflict in guidance between USAF, FAA, ICAO, and NATO
   documents, the USAF generally follows ICAO guidance wherever feasible. Significant differences in
   signals are annotated wherever possible.
   2.5.2. The marshaller will signal facing the aircraft while standing in one of the following positions:
       2.5.2.1. Fixed Wing Aircraft. The marshaller will stand forward of the left wingtip of the aircraft
       and remain in full view of the pilot.
       2.5.2.2. Helicopters. The marshaller will stand in full view of the pilot (the pilot is usually on the
       right side of the helicopter).
   2.5.3. During night operations or restricted visibility, the marshaller will use a pair of same color light
   wands. During surface taxiing or parking, the pilot must stop immediately if one or both of the mar-
   shaller's wands fail.

                                                  Chapter 3

                             AIRPORT MARKINGS, LIGHTS AND SIGNS

Section 3A—Standard Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs.

3.1. Standard Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs. All ground and aircrew personnel involved with
moving aircraft on the ground must be familiar with airport markings, lights and signs. This is to direct
and control movement and operation of aircraft on the ground and reduce runway incursions. Refer to
Chapter 1 for testing requirements.

3.2. Visual Aid for Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs.
     3.2.1. FAA Form 5280-7 shows selected FAA airport markings and signs identical to those in Section
     3C, Section 3D, and Section 3E. For units based at civilian or joint use airports, display this visual aid
     where maintenance and flight related operations take place. Suitable locations are aircraft mainte-
     nance work areas and flight line buildings frequented by ground and aircrew personnel. This visual
     aid is available free from the FAA via http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety/. Select the button “Run-
     way Safety Awareness Materials”. Select “Ground Vehicle Guide Placard”.
     3.2.2. AFVA 11-240 shows selected USAF airport markings and signs identical to those in Section
     3C, Section 3D, and Section 3E. For units based at USAF installations, display this visual aid where
     maintenance and flight related operations take place. Suitable locations are aircraft maintenance work
     areas and flight line buildings frequented by ground and aircrew personnel. This includes vehicles
     operated on USAF airfields. Reference AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, for further flight line driv-
     ing information.
     3.2.3. Units located at contingency or foreign airfields use the visual aid (FAA or USAF) that most
     clearly depicts the actual markings at the airfield.

3.3. Compliance With Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs. Where possible, airport markings, lights,
and signs shown in this instruction are taken from applicable ICAO NATO, and FAA airport markings,
lights, and signs documents. Not all airfields will have all forms of markings, lights, and signs described
in this chapter. Certain older airfields may be “grand fathered” under obsolete standards. Additional vari-
ations may be required due to unique terrain, or obstacles. Foreign airfields may not comply with ICAO
Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS). Installation of a particular system is dependent on air-
field design, airfield jurisdiction, age of the airfield, predominant use, geographic location, and other
operational factors. Flight Information Publications (FLIP) and local directives detail configurations for
each particular airfield. Personnel must be familiar with the specific airport markings, lights, and signs at
a particular airfield prior to operating an aircraft on that airfield. In case of conflict between ICAO,
NATO, FAA, and USAF documents, USAF requirements take precedence at USAF airfields. Significant
differences are annotated to the maximum extent feasible.

Section 3B—Airport Markings

3.4. General.
   3.4.1. For the purpose of this regulation the Airport Pavement Markings have been grouped into four
   areas:
      3.4.1.1. Runway Markings.
      3.4.1.2. Taxiway Markings.
      3.4.1.3. Holding Position Markings.
      3.4.1.4. Other Markings.
   3.4.2. Marking Colors. Most runway markings are white. Arresting System Warning Markings are
   yellow. USAF and some ICAO arrowheads and chevrons in displaced threshold areas are yellow.
   Markings defining the landing area on a heliport are also white, except for hospital heliports that use
   a red "H" on a white cross. Markings for taxiways, areas not intended for use by aircraft (closed and
   hazardous areas), and holding positions (even if they are on a runway) are usually yellow.

3.5. Runway Markings.
   3.5.1. Runway Designators. Runway numbers and letters are determined from the approach direction.
   The runway number is the whole number nearest one-tenth the magnetic azimuth of the centerline of
   the runway, measured clockwise from the magnetic north. The letters, differentiate between left (L),
   right (R), or center (C), parallel runways, as applicable:
      3.5.1.1. For two parallel runways "L" "R."
      3.5.1.2. For three parallel runways "L" "C" "R."
   3.5.2. Runway Centerline Marking. The runway centerline identifies the center of the runway and
   consists of a line of uniformly spaced stripes and gaps.
   3.5.3. Runway Side Stripe Marking. Runway side stripes delineate the edges of the runway to
   enhance visual acquisition of the runway environment during transition from instrument to visual
   flight. Side stripes consist of continuous white stripes located on each side of the runway.
   3.5.4. Runway Shoulder Markings. Runway shoulder stripes may be used to supplement runway side
   stripes to identify pavement areas contiguous to the runway sides that are not intended for use by air-
   craft. Runway Shoulder stripes are yellow.

Figure 3.1. Runway Shoulder Markings.




     3.5.5. Threshold Bar. FAA Only. A threshold bar delineates the beginning of the runway that is avail-
     able for landing when there is pavement aligned with the runway on the approach side of the thresh-
     old. The threshold bar is 10 feet wide and is white since it is part of the useable runway surface.
     3.5.6. Demarcation Bar. A demarcation bar delineates a runway with a displaced threshold from a
     blast pad, under run, stopway (overrun) or taxiway that precedes the runway.
        3.5.6.1. FAA Only. The demarcation bar is three feet wide and is located on the blast pad, stop-
        way or taxiway at the point of intersection with the runway. It is yellow to indicate it is not part of
        the useable runway, except when the area preceding the threshold can be used for takeoff, then the
        demarcation bar will be white.
        3.5.6.2. USAF/ICAO Only. Neither USAF nor ICAO require a demarcation bar for contiguous
        blast pads or overruns. The demarcation bar is only required where operational pavement is
        located on the approach side of the threshold marking, such as with a displaced threshold or con-
        tiguous taxiway. In those cases, the bar is four feet wide and is white because it is located on the
        runway surface.
     3.5.7. Threshold Markings. These markings are used to show pavement areas aligned with the run-
     way that are unusable for landing, takeoff, and/or taxiing.
        3.5.7.1. General Information.
            3.5.7.1.1. Arrowheads highlight the beginning of the useable landing surface.
            3.5.7.1.2. Taxiway markings in a displaced threshold area indicate an area suitable for taxi
            only.
            3.5.7.1.3. Arrows in a displaced threshold area indicate an area suitable for taxi and takeoff
            only.
            3.5.7.1.4. Chevrons in a displaced threshold area indicate an area unsuitable for taxi, takeoff,
            or landing.
        3.5.7.2. Arrows and Arrowheads.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                  67


        3.5.7.2.1. FAA Only. Arrows and arrowheads used in a displaced threshold area are white
        since the area is useable for takeoff. Arrowheads used on a taxiway prior to a runway threshold
        are yellow since the area is not useable for takeoff or landing.
        3.5.7.2.2. USAF Only. In permanently displaced thresholds all arrows and arrowheads are
        yellow. The shaft of the arrow will be white. In temporarily displaced thresholds the arrow-
        heads could be white or yellow.
        3.5.7.2.3. ICAO Only. Arrows and arrowheads used in a displaced threshold area may be
        white or yellow regardless of whether the displaced threshold area is suitable for takeoff.
     3.5.7.3. Chevrons
        3.5.7.3.1. Chevrons are yellow since the area is unusable for taxi, takeoff, or landing.

3.6. Taxiway Markings.
   3.6.1. All taxiways should have centerline markings and runway holding position markings whenever
   they intersect a runway. Taxiway edge markings are present whenever there is a need to separate the
   taxiway from a pavement that is not intended for aircraft use or to delineate the edge of the taxiway.
   Taxiways may also have shoulder markings and holding position markings for Instrument Landing
   System/Microwave Landing System (ILS/MLS) critical areas, and taxiway/taxiway intersection
   markings.
NOTE: The USAF has no requirement to mark taxiway/taxiway intersections at USAF installations.

70                             AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007


     3.6.2. Taxiway Centerline. The taxiway centerline is a single continuous yellow line. This provides a
     visual cue to permit taxiing along a designated path. Ideally the aircraft should be kept centered over
     this line during taxi to ensure adequate clearance.
     3.6.3. Taxiway Edge Markings. Taxiway edge markings are used to define the edge of the taxiway.
     They are primarily used when the taxiway edge does not correspond with the edge of the pavement.
     There are two types of markings depending upon whether the aircraft is supposed to cross the taxiway
     edge:
        3.6.3.1. Continuous Markings. These consist of a continuous double yellow line. They are used to
        define the taxiway edge from the shoulder or some other abutting paved surface not intended for
        use by aircraft.
        3.6.3.2. Dashed Markings. These markings are used when there is an operational need to define
        the edge of a taxiway or taxi lane on a paved surface where the adjoining pavement to the taxiway
        edge is intended for use by aircraft. e.g., an apron. Dashed taxiway edge markings consist of a bro-
        ken double yellow line.

Figure 3.5. Taxiway Edge Markings.




        3.6.3.3. Taxiway Shoulder Markings. Taxiways, holding bays, and aprons are sometimes pro-
        vided with paved shoulders to prevent blast and water erosion. Although shoulders may have the
        appearance of full strength pavement they are not intended for use by aircraft, and may be unable
        to support an aircraft. Usually the taxiway edge marking will define this area. Where conditions
        exist such as islands or taxiway curves that may cause confusion as to which side of the edge stripe
        is for use by aircraft, taxiway shoulder markings may be used to indicate the pavement is unus-
        able. Taxiway shoulder markings are yellow.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                      71


Figure 3.6. Taxiway Shoulder Markings.




   3.6.4. Surface Painted Taxiway Direction Signs. Surface painted taxiway direction signs have a yel-
   low background with a black inscription, and are provided when it is not possible to provide taxiway
   direction signs at intersections, or when necessary to supplement such signs. These markings are
   located adjacent to the centerline with signs indicating turns to the left being on the left side of the
   taxiway centerline and signs indicating turns to the right being on the right side of the centerline.
NOTE: At USAF installations, surface painted taxiway direction signs are yellow block letters with no
background.
   3.6.5. Surface Painted Location Signs. Surface painted location signs have a black background with a
   yellow inscription. When necessary, these markings are used to supplement location signs located
   along side the taxiway and assist the pilot in confirming the designation of the taxiway on which the
   aircraft is located. These markings are located on the right side of the centerline.
NOTE: At USAF installations, surface painted location signs are yellow block letters with no back-
ground.

Figure 3.7. Surface Painted Location and Direction Signs.




NOTE: At USAF installations, surface painted taxiway direction and location signs are yellow block let-
ters with no background.
     3.6.6. Geographic Position Markings. These markings are located at points along low visibility taxi
     routes designated in the airport's Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS) plan. They
     are used to identify the location of taxiing aircraft during low visibility operations. Low visibility
     operations are those that occur when the runway visual range (RVR) is below 1200 feet. They are
     positioned to the left of the taxiway centerline in the direction of taxiing. The geographic position
     marking is a circle comprised of an outer black ring contiguous to a white ring with a pink circle in the
     middle. When installed on asphalt or other dark-colored pavements, the white ring and the black ring
     are reversed, i.e., the white ring becomes the outer ring and the black ring becomes the inner ring. It is
     designated with either a number or a number and letter. The number corresponds to the consecutive
     position of the marking on the route.

Figure 3.8. Geographic Position Markings.




3.7. Holding Position Markings.
   3.7.1. Runway Holding Position Markings. For runways these markings indicate where an aircraft is
   supposed to stop. For the FAA, they consist of four yellow lines, two solid and two dashed, extending
   across the width of the taxiway or runway. For the USAF, they may only consist of two yellow lines,
   one solid and one dashed, extending across the width of the runway or taxiway. The solid lines are
   always on the side where the aircraft is to hold. There are three locations where runway holding posi-
   tion markings are encountered.
CAUTION: The USAF Runway Holding Position Marking shown below is the same as the FAA mark-
ing for a Non-movement Area Boundary. Personnel must be cognizant of this difference to avoid a run-
way incursion.

        3.7.1.1. Taxiways. These markings identify the locations on a taxiway where an aircraft is sup-
        posed to stop when it does not have clearance to proceed onto the runway. The runway holding
        position markings are shown. When instructed by ATC "Hold short of (runway "xx")" the aircrew
        or ground crew should stop so no part of the aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking.
        When approaching the holding position marking, an aircrew or ground crew person should not
        cross the marking without ATC clearance at a controlled airport or without making sure of ade-
        quate separation from other aircraft at uncontrolled airports. An aircraft exiting a runway is not
        clear of the runway until all parts of the aircraft have crossed the applicable holding position mark-
        ing.
        3.7.1.2. Runways. These markings are installed on runways only if the runway is normally used
        by air traffic control for "land, hold short" operations or taxiing operations and have operational
        significance only for those two types of operations. A sign with a white inscription on a red back-
        ground is installed adjacent to these holding position markings. The holding position markings are
        placed on runways prior to the intersection with another runway, or some designated point.
        3.7.1.3. Runway Approach Areas. These markings are used at some airports where it is necessary
        to hold an aircraft on a taxiway located in the approach or departure area of a runway so that the
        aircraft does not interfere with the operations on that runway. This marking is collocated with the
        runway approach area holding position sign.
     3.7.2. Holding Position Markings for ILS. Holding position markings for ILS/MLS critical areas con-
     sist of two yellow solid lines spaced two feet apart connected by pairs of solid lines extending across
     the width of the taxiway as shown. A sign with an inscription in white on a red background is installed
     adjacent to these hold position markings. When the ILS critical area is being protected, the aircrew or
     ground crew should stop so no part of the aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking. When
     approaching the holding position marking, an aircrew or ground crew person should not cross the
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                        75


   marking without ATC clearance. ILS critical area is not clear until all parts of the aircraft have crossed
   the applicable holding position marking.
NOTE: At USAF bases, additional markings will be present at the holding position. The letters “INST”
are painted symmetrically about the centerline of the taxiway just beyond the instrument hold line so they
can be read by an aircraft operator facing the runway.

Figure 3.10. Holding Position Markings for ILS Critical Area.




   3.7.3. Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway Intersections. Holding position markings for
   taxiway/taxiway intersections consist of a single dashed line extending across the width of the taxi-
   way. They are installed on taxiways where air traffic control normally holds aircraft short of a taxiway
   intersection. When instructed by ATC "hold short of (taxiway)" the aircrew or ground crew should
   stop so no part of the aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking. When the marking is not
   present the aircrew or ground crew should stop the aircraft at a point that provides adequate clearance
   from an aircraft on the intersecting taxiway.
NOTE: The USAF has no requirement to mark taxiway/taxiway intersections at USAF installations.

Figure 3.11. Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway Intersections.




     3.7.4. Surface Painted Holding Position Signs. Surface painted holding position signs have a red
     background with a white inscription and supplement the signs located at the holding position. This
     type of marking is normally used where the width of the holding position on the taxiway is greater
     than 200 feet. It is located to the left side of the taxiway centerline on the holding side and prior to the
     holding position marking.

Figure 3.12. Surface Painted Holding Position Sign.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                        77


3.8. Other Markings.
   3.8.1. Vehicle Roadway Markings. The vehicle roadway markings are used when necessary to define
   a pathway for vehicle operations on or crossing areas that are also intended for aircraft. These mark-
   ings consist of a single or double white solid line to delineate each edge of the roadway and dashed or
   solid yellow or white lines to separate lanes within the edges of the roadway. In lieu of the solid lines,
   zipper markings may be used to delineate the edges of the vehicle roadway.

Figure 3.13. Vehicle Roadway Markings.




   3.8.2. Non-movement Area Boundary Markings. These markings delineate the movement area, i.e.,
   area under air traffic control. These markings are yellow and located on the boundary between the
   movement and non-movement area. The non-movement area boundary markings consist of two yel-
   low lines, one solid and one dashed. The solid line is located on the non-movement area side while the
   dashed yellow line is located on the movement area side.
NOTE: There is no requirement for non-movement area boundary markings at USAF installations.
CAUTION: The USAF Runway Holding Position Marking is the same as the FAA marking for a
Non-movement Area Boundary shown below. Personnel must be cognizant of this difference to avoid a
runway incursion.

Figure 3.14. Non-movement Area Boundary Markings.




     3.8.3. Marking and Lighting of Permanently Closed Runways and Taxiways. For runways and taxi-
     ways that are permanently closed, the lighting circuits will be disconnected. The runway threshold,
     runway designation, and touchdown markings are obliterated and yellow X’s are placed at each end of
     the runway and at 1,000-foot intervals.

Figure 3.15. Closed Runway or Taxiway Markings.




     3.8.4. Temporarily Closed Runways and Taxiways. To provide a visual indication to pilots that a run-
     way is temporarily closed; X’s are placed on the runway only at each end of the runway. The X’s are
     yellow in color.
        3.8.4.1. A raised lighted yellow X may be placed on each runway end in lieu of the markings
        described to indicate the runway is closed.
        3.8.4.2. A visual indication may not be present depending on the reason for the closure, duration
        of the closure, airfield configuration and the existence and the hours of operation of an airport traf-
        fic control tower. Pilots should check NOTAM's and the Automated Terminal Information System
        (ATIS) for local runway and taxiway closure information.
        3.8.4.3. Temporarily closed taxiways are usually treated as hazardous areas, in which no part of
        an aircraft may enter, and are blocked with barricades. However, as an alternative a yellow X may
        be installed at each entrance to the taxiway.
     3.8.5. Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopter landing areas can be depicted in one of three ways, as
     shown below. The letter "H" in the markings is oriented to align with the intended direction of
     approach.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                        79

Section 3C—Airport Lighting Systems

3.9. Runway Lights
   3.9.1. Runway Edge Lights. Runway edge lights are used to outline the edges of runways during peri-
   ods of darkness or restricted visibility. The runway edge lights are white, except on instrument run-
   ways yellow (or amber) replaces white on the last 2,000 feet or half the runway length, whichever is
   less, to form a caution zone for landings.
   3.9.2. Runway End Lights. Runway end lights define the end of the operational runway surface for
   aircraft for landing, roll out, or takeoff. They consist of red lights located symmetrically about, and
   perpendicular to, the runway centerline. They are located within 10 feet of the end of the usable land-
   ing surface.
   3.9.3. Runway Threshold Lights. Runway threshold lights define the beginning of the operational
   runway surface for aircraft for landing. The lights emit red light toward the runway to indicate the run-
   way end to a departing aircraft and may emit green outward from the runway end to indicate the
   threshold to landing aircraft.
   3.9.4. Runway Centerline Lighting System. Runway centerline lights are installed on some precision
   instrument runways. They are located along the runway centerline and are spaced at 50-foot intervals.
   When viewed from the landing threshold, the runway centerline lights are white until the last 3,000
   feet of the runway. The white lights begin to alternate with red for the next 2,000 feet, and for the last
   1,000 feet of the runway, all centerline lights are red.
   3.9.5. Touchdown Zone Lights. Touchdown zone lights are installed on some precision approach
   runways. They consist of two rows of transverse light bars disposed symmetrically about the runway
   centerline. The system consists of steady-burning white lights that start 100 feet beyond the landing
   threshold and extend to 3,000 feet beyond the landing threshold or to the midpoint of the runway,
   whichever is less.
80                              AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007


     3.9.6. Stopway Lights (ICAO ONLY). Stopway lights are installed in stopways intended for use at
     night. They are placed in rows as an extension of the line of runway edge lights, with an additional
     line perpendicular to the runway centerline at the end of the stopway. Stopway lights are red.
     3.9.7. Taxiway Lead-Off Lights. (FAA and ICAO ONLY). Taxiway lead-off lights extend from the
     runway centerline to a point on an exit taxiway to expedite movement of aircraft from the runway.
     These lights alternate green and yellow (or amber) from the runway centerline to the runway holding
     position or the ILS/MLS critical area, as appropriate.
     3.9.8. Runway Exit Lights. (USAF ONLY). Runway exit lights serve the same function as taxiway
     lead-off lights. At USAF airfields these lights are green.
     3.9.9. Land and Hold Short Lights. Land and hold short lights are used to indicate the hold short point
     on certain runways that are approved for Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). Land and hold
     short lights consist of a row of pulsing white lights installed across the runway at the hold short point.
     Where installed, the lights will be on anytime LAHSO is in effect. These lights will be off when
     LAHSO is not in effect.

3.10. Control of Lighting Systems.
     3.10.1. Operation of approach light systems and runway lighting is controlled by the control tower
     (ATCT). At some locations the Flight Service Station (FSS) may control the lights where there is no
     control tower in operation.
     3.10.2. Pilot’s radio control of lighting is available at selected airports to provide control of lights by
     keying the aircraft's microphone. Control of lighting systems is often available at locations without
     specified hours for lighting and where there is no control tower or FSS or when the tower or FSS is
     closed (locations with a part-time tower or FSS) or specified hours. All lighting systems that are radio
     controlled at an airport, whether on a single runway or multiple runways, operate on the same radio
     frequency. USAF personnel should not adjust the intensity of lights, unless preparing to take off or
     land, to preclude producing a setting undesirable for a pilot attempting to take off or land.

3.11. Taxiway Lights
     3.11.1. FAA
        3.11.1.1. Taxiway Edge Lights. Taxiway edge lights are used to outline the edges of taxiways
        during periods of darkness or restricted visibility. These fixtures emit blue light.
        3.11.1.2. Taxiway Centerline Lights. Taxiway centerline lights are located along the taxiway cen-
        terline in a straight line on straight portions, on the centerline of curved portions, and along desig-
        nated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron areas. Taxiway centerline lights are
        steady burning and emit green light.
        3.11.1.3. Clearance Bar Lights. Clearance bar lights are installed at holding positions on taxiways
        in order to increase the conspicuity of the holding position in low visibility conditions. They may
        also be installed to indicate the location of an intersecting taxiway during periods of darkness.
        Clearance bars consist of three in-pavement steady-burning yellow (or amber) lights.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                        81


Figure 3.17. Clearance Bar Lights.




      3.11.1.4. Runway Guard Lights. Runway guard lights are installed at taxiway/runway intersec-
      tions. They are primarily used to enhance the conspicuity of taxiway/runway intersections during
      low visibility conditions, but may be used in all weather conditions. Runway guard lights consist
      of either a pair of elevated flashing yellow (or amber) lights installed on either side of the taxiway,
      or a row of in-pavement yellow (or amber) lights installed across the entire taxiway, at the runway
      holding position marking.

Figure 3.18. Runway Guard Lights.




          3.11.1.4.1. Some airports may have a row of three or five in-pavement yellow (or amber)
          lights installed at taxiway/runway intersections. They should not be confused with clearance
          bar lights described in paragraph 3.11.1.3. Clearance Bar Lights.
      3.11.1.5. Stop Bar Lights. Stop bar lights, when installed, are used to confirm the ATC clearance
      to enter or cross the active runway in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft RVR). A stop bar
      consists of a row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement lights installed across the
      entire taxiway at the runway holding position, and elevated steady-burning red lights on each side.
      A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunction with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights that
      extend from the stop bar toward the runway. Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar
      is turned off and the lead-on lights are turned on. The stop bar and lead-on lights are automatically
      reset by a sensor or backup timer.
          3.11.1.5.1. Aircrews and ground crews should never cross a red illuminated stop bar, even if
          an ATC clearance has been given to proceed onto or across the runway.
          3.11.1.5.2. If after crossing a stop bar, the taxiway centerline lead-on lights inadvertently
          extinguish, aircrews and ground crews should hold their position and contact ATC for further
          instructions.

     3.11.2. USAF
        3.11.2.1. Taxiway Edge Lights. Taxiway edge lights are used to outline the edges of taxiways
        during periods of darkness or restricted visibility. These fixtures emit blue light.
        3.11.2.2. Taxiway Centerline Lights. Taxiway centerline lights are located along the taxiway cen-
        terline in a straight line on straight portions, on the centerline of curved portions, and along desig-
        nated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron areas. Taxiway centerline lights are
        steady burning and emit green light. Where there are intersecting taxiways, the lights will be yel-
        low (or amber). When installed in conjunction with a holding position, they will be yellow (or
        amber) facing the holding aircraft. Taxiway centerline lights may be installed in lieu of taxiway
        edge lights.
        3.11.2.3. Taxiway Hold Lights/Stop Bar. Taxiway hold lights are installed at hold positions
        where there is a need to enhance identification. They consist of 3 yellow (or amber) lights perpen-
        dicular to taxiway centerline (5 lights will be installed if the taxiway is unusually wide).
        3.11.2.4. Hold Position Edge Lights (Wig-Wag or Runway Guard Lights). Hold position edge
        lights are installed at taxiway/runway intersections and other areas where hold markings, signs,
        and clearance markings have not been fully effective, or in areas where other lights might cause
        distraction. They consist of a pair of elevated flashing yellow (or amber) lights installed on either
        side of the taxiway.
     3.11.3. ICAO
        3.11.3.1. Taxiway Edge Lights. Taxiway edge lights are used to outline the edges of taxiways
        during periods of darkness or restricted visibility conditions. These fixtures emit blue light.
        3.11.3.2. Taxiway Centerline Lights. Taxiway centerline lights are located along the taxiway cen-
        terline in a straight line on straight portions, on the centerline of curved portions, and along desig-
        nated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron areas. Taxiway centerline lights are
        steady burning and emit green light.
        3.11.3.3. Runway Guard Lights. Runway guard lights are installed at taxiway/runway intersec-
        tions. They are primarily used to enhance the conspicuity of taxiway/runway intersections during
        low visibility conditions, but may be used in all weather conditions. Runway guard lights consist
        of either a pair of elevated flashing yellow (or amber) lights installed on either side of the taxiway,
        or a row of in-pavement yellow (or amber) lights installed across the entire taxiway, at the runway
        holding position marking.

Figure 3.20. Runway Guard Lights.




       3.11.3.4. Stop Bar Lights. Stop bar lights, when installed, are used to confirm the ATC clearance
       to enter or cross the active runway in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft RVR). A stop bar
       consists of a row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement lights installed across the
       entire taxiway at the runway holding position, and elevated steady-burning red lights on each side.
       A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunction with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights that
       extend from the stop bar toward the runway. Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar
       is turned off and the lead-on lights are turned on. The stop bar and lead-on lights are automatically
       reset by a sensor or backup timer.
           3.11.3.4.1. Aircrews and ground crews should never cross a red illuminated stop bar, even if
           an ATC clearance has been given to proceed onto or across the runway.
           3.11.3.4.2. If after crossing a stop bar, the taxiway centerline lead-on lights inadvertently
           extinguish, aircrews and ground crews should hold their position and contact ATC for further
           instructions.

Section 3D—Airport Signs

3.12. General. There are six types of signs installed on airfields: mandatory instruction signs, location
signs, direction signs, destination signs, information signs, and runway distance remaining signs.

3.13. Mandatory Instruction Signs.
   3.13.1. These signs have a red background with a white inscription and are used to denote:
       3.13.1.1. An entrance to a runway or critical area and;
       3.13.1.2. Areas where an aircraft is prohibited from entering.
   3.13.2. Typical mandatory signs and applications are:
       3.13.2.1. Runway Holding Position Sign. This sign is located at the holding position on taxiways
       that intersect a runway or on runways that intersect other runways. The inscription on the sign
       contains the designation of the intersecting runway. The runway numbers on the sign are arranged
       to correspond to the respective runway threshold. For example, "15-33" indicates that the thresh-
       old for Runway 15 is to the left and the threshold for Runway 33 is to the right.
84                           AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007


Figure 3.22. Runway Holding Position Sign.




      3.13.2.2. Runway Holding Position Sign at Beginning of Takeoff Runway. On taxiways that
      intersect the beginning of the takeoff runway, only the designation of the takeoff runway may
      appear on the sign, while all other signs will have the designation of both runway directions.

Figure 3.23. Runway Holding Position Sign at Beginning of Takeoff Runway.




      3.13.2.3. Runway Holding Position Sign at Intersection of Two Runways. If the sign is located on
      a taxiway that intersects the intersection of two runways, the designations for both runways will be
      shown on the sign along with arrows showing the approximate alignment of each runway. In addi-
      tion to showing the approximate runway alignment, the arrow indicates the direction to the thresh-
      old of the runway whose designation is immediately next to the arrow.

Figure 3.24. Runway Holding Position Sign at Intersection of Two Runways.




      3.13.2.4. Position of Runway Holding Position Signs. A runway holding position sign on a taxi-
      way will be installed adjacent to holding position markings on the taxiway pavement. On run-
      ways, holding position markings will be located only on the runway pavement adjacent to the sign,
      if the runway is normally used by air traffic control for LAHSO operations or as a taxiway.
      3.13.2.5. Runway Approach Area Holding Position Sign. At some airports, it is necessary to hold
      an aircraft on a taxiway located in the approach or departure area for a runway so that the aircraft
      does not interfere with operations on that runway. In these situations, a sign with the designation
      of the approach end of the runway followed by a "dash" (-) and letters "APCH" will be located at
      the holding position on the taxiway. Holding position markings will be located on the taxiway
      pavement. An example of this sign is shown in below. In this example, the sign may protect the
      approach to Runway 15 and/or the departure for Runway 33.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                      85


Figure 3.25. Runway Approach Area Holding Position Sign.




      3.13.2.6. ILS Critical Area Holding Position Sign. At some airports, when the instrument landing
      system is being used, it is necessary to hold an aircraft on a taxiway at a location other than the
      holding position described above in Holding Position Markings. This prevents vehicles and air-
      craft on the ground from interfering with the ILS signal transmitted to an aircraft on final
      approach. In these situations the holding position sign for these operations will have the inscrip-
      tion "ILS" and be located adjacent to the holding position marking on the taxiway. At USAF air-
      fields this sign will say “INST”.

Figure 3.26. ILS Critical Area Holding Position Sign.




      3.13.2.7. No Entry Sign. This sign prohibits an aircraft from entering an area. Typically, this sign
      would be located on a taxiway intended to be used in only one direction or at the intersection of
      vehicle roadways with runways, taxiways or aprons where the roadway may be mistaken as a taxi-
      way or other aircraft movement surface.

Figure 3.27. No Entry Sign.




3.14. Location Signs.
   3.14.1. Location signs are used to identify either a taxiway or runway on which the aircraft is located.
   Other location signs provide a visual cue to aircrews and ground crews to assist them in determining
   when they have exited an area.
      3.14.1.1. Taxiway Location Sign. This sign has a black background with a yellow inscription and
      yellow border. The inscription is the designation of the taxiway on which the aircraft is located.
      These signs are installed along taxiways either by themselves or in conjunction with direction
86                          AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007


      signs or runway holding position signs. Taxiways are designated using all letters of the alphabet,
      normally starting with “A”.

Figure 3.28. Taxiway Location Sign.




Figure 3.29. Taxiway Location Sign Collocated With Runway Holding Position Sign.




      3.14.1.2. Runway Location Sign. This sign has a black background with a yellow inscription and
      yellow border. The inscription is the designation of the runway on which the aircraft is located.
      These signs are intended to complement the information available to aircrews and ground crews
      through their magnetic compass and typically are installed where the proximity of two or more
      runways to one another could cause pilots to be confused as to which runway they are on.

Figure 3.30. Runway Location Sign.




      3.14.1.3. Runway Boundary Sign. This sign has a yellow background with a black inscription
      with a graphic depicting the pavement holding position marking. This sign, which faces the run-
      way and is visible to the aircrew or ground crew exiting the runway, is located adjacent to the
      holding position marking on the pavement. The sign is intended to provide aircrews and ground
      crews with another visual cue which they can use as a guide in deciding when they are "clear of
      the runway."
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                    87


Figure 3.31. Runway Boundary Sign.




       3.14.1.4. ILS Critical Area Boundary Sign. This sign has a yellow background with a black
       inscription with a graphic depicting the ILS pavement holding position marking. This sign is
       located adjacent to the ILS holding position marking on the pavement and can be seen by aircrews
       and ground crews leaving the critical area. The sign is intended to provide aircrews and ground
       crews with another visual cue they can use as a guide in deciding when they are "clear of the ILS
       critical area." Note at USAF airfields this is referred to as the “Instrument Critical Area”.

Figure 3.32. ILS Critical Area Boundary Sign.




3.15. Direction Signs.
   3.15.1. Direction signs have a yellow background with a black inscription. The inscription identifies
   the designation(s) of the intersecting taxiway(s) leading out of the intersection that an aircrew or
   ground crew would normally be expected to turn onto or hold short of. An arrow indicating the direc-
   tion of the turn accompanies each designation.
       3.15.1.1. Except as noted in 3.14.1.1., each taxiway designation shown on the sign is accompa-
       nied by only one arrow. When more than one taxiway designation is shown on the sign each des-
       ignation and its associated arrow is separated from the other taxiway designations by either a
       vertical message divider or a taxiway location sign.
          3.15.1.1.1. Direction signs are normally located on the left prior to the intersection. When
          used on a runway to indicate an exit, the sign is located on the same side of the runway as the
          exit.

Figure 3.33. Direction Sign to Indicate Runway Exit.




        3.15.1.2. The taxiway designations and their associated arrows on the sign are arranged clockwise
        starting from the first taxiway on the pilot's left.
        3.15.1.3. If a location sign is located with the direction signs, it is placed so that the designations
        for all turns to the left will be to the left of the location sign; the designations for continuing
        straight ahead or for all turns to the right would be located to the right of the location sign.
        3.15.1.4. When the intersection is comprised of only one crossing taxiway, it is permissible to
        have two arrows associated with the crossing taxiway. In this case, the location sign is located to
        the left of the direction sign.

3.16. Destination Signs
     3.16.1. Destination signs also have a yellow background with a black inscription indicating a destina-
     tion on the airport. These signs always have an arrow showing the direction of the taxiing route to that
     destination. When the arrow on the destination sign indicates a turn, the sign is located prior to the
     intersection.
     3.16.2. Destinations commonly shown on these types of signs include runways, aprons, terminals,
     military areas, civil aviation areas, cargo areas, international areas, and fixed base operators. An
     abbreviation may be used as the inscription on the sign for some of these destinations.
        3.16.2.1. When the inscription for two or more destinations having a common taxiing route are
        placed on a sign, the destinations are separated by a "dot" (•) and one arrow. When the inscription
        on a sign contains two or more destinations having different taxiing routes, each destination will
        be accompanied by an arrow and will be separated from the other destinations on the sign with a
        vertical black message divider.

3.17. Information Signs.
   3.17.1. Information signs have a yellow background with a black inscription. They are used to pro-
   vide the pilot with information on such things as areas that cannot be seen from the control tower,
   applicable radio frequencies, and noise abatement procedures. The airport operator determines the
   need, size, and location for these signs.

3.18. Runway Distance Remaining Signs.
   3.18.1. Runway distance remaining signs have a black background with a white numeral inscription
   and may be installed along one or both side(s) of the runway. The number on the signs indicates the
   distance (in thousands of feet) of landing runway remaining. The last sign, i.e., the sign with the
   numeral "1," will be located at least 950 feet from the runway end.

Section 3E—Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS)

3.19. General Information
     3.19.1. FAA Only. SMGCS is implemented at selected US airports where scheduled air carriers are
     authorized to conduct operations when the visibility is less than 1,200 RVR. A SMGCS plan facili-
     tates the safe movement of aircraft and vehicles on the airport by establishing more rigorous control
     procedures and requiring enhanced visual aids. This plan helps insure aircraft and vehicles remain in
     the areas intended for their use.
     3.19.2. ICAO Only. SMGCS is defined as a system that provides guidance to, and control or regula-
     tion of aircraft in the movement area. The system also provides guidance to, and control or regulation
     of all ground vehicles in the movement area. The term SMGCS is applied to the system of aids, facil-
     ities, procedures, and regulations and applies during all weather conditions.
NOTE: Several aerospace companies market surface movement radar and surveillance systems (hard-
ware) also called SMGCS that may be part of an overall SMGCS plan but should not be confused with the
plan itself.
        3.19.2.1. For ICAO airports, SMGCS is implemented in three stages:
            3.19.2.1.1. Visibility Condition 1. Visibility is sufficient for the pilot to taxi and avoid colli-
            sion with other traffic by visual reference, and for ATC to exercise control over all traffic by
            visual reference.
            3.19.2.1.2. Visibility Condition 2. Visibility is sufficient for the pilot to taxi and avoid colli-
            sion with other traffic by visual reference, but insufficient for ATC to exercise control of all
            traffic by visual reference.
            3.19.2.1.3. Visibility Condition 3. Visibility is less than 400 meters RVR (1200 feet). Visibil-
            ity is insufficient for the pilot to taxi and avoid collision with other traffic by visual reference,
            and also insufficient for ATC to exercise control over traffic by visual reference. This is called
            “low visibility conditions”.
     3.19.3. SMGCS procedures do not supersede established policies, procedures, rules or guidelines for
     airports, aircraft or vehicle operators, or air traffic control. Compliance with SMGCS procedures and
     restrictions is not mandatory for USAF personnel. However, to enhance the safety of low visibility
     ground operations, USAF personnel shall follow the guidance in the SMGCS plan to the maximum
     extent possible when conducting low visibility operations at an airport with such a plan.

3.20. SMGCS Training.
     3.20.1. When complying with 3.19.3. above, personnel involved in moving aircraft on the ground at
     airports with a SMGCS plan shall receive training prior to conducting low visibility operations at that
     airport. SMGCS training is airport specific.
        3.20.1.1. Training lesson plans will include as a minimum ramp operations, ILS critical areas,
        runway safety areas, obstacle free zones, stop bar lights, runway guard lights, taxiway centerline
        lights, clearance bar lights, runway lead-on and lead-off lights, geographic position markings,
        taxiway and runway hold position markings, movement/non-movement area boundary marking,
        other pavement markings, use of low visibility taxi route(s) chart(s), review of local taxi routes
        and procedures, and taxi procedures at turns requiring judgmental over steering.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                     91


          3.20.1.1.1. For aircrew personnel, document training completion in ARMS, MAJCOM speci-
          fied training folder or other suitable product. Annotate the airport for which training applies.
          3.20.1.1.2. For maintenance personnel, document training completion in AF Form 623, On
          The Job Training Record, or other suitable product. Annotate the airport for which training
          applies.

3.21. SMGCS Procedures (FAA).
   3.21.1. SMGCS procedures will be implemented when the RVR is below 1,200 feet. Additional pro-
   cedures will be implemented for RVR below 600 feet.
      3.21.1.1. ATC is responsible to initiate and terminate each phase of SMGCS procedures IAW the
      SMGCS plan for that airport. Implementation and termination will be based on meteorological
      trends of increasing/decreasing RVR values and weather phenomena such as patchy fog and pilot
      reports.
      3.21.1.2. SMGCS procedures initiation/termination will be broadcast on the ATIS.
      3.21.1.3. Specific aircrew SMGCS procedures are in the SMGCS plan for that particular airport.
   3.21.2. When complying with the SMGCS plan, USAF personnel shall use the low visibility taxi
   route(s) chart(s) for that airport.
      3.21.2.1. NOTE: Low visibility taxi route charts for CONUS airports are available only from
      Jeppesen. Comply with AFI 11-202 Volume 3 General Flight Rules for use of commercially pro-
      duced publications.
   3.21.3. The following visual aids are required for operations when the RVR is below 1,200 feet down
   to and including 600 feet RVR, except where others are specified in the SMGCS plan for that airport.
      3.21.3.1. Movement Area.
          3.21.3.1.1. Runway guard lights
          3.21.3.1.2. Taxiway edge or centerline lights
          3.21.3.1.3. Taxiway signs
          3.21.3.1.4. Taxiway hold markings
          3.21.3.1.5. Surface painted direction or location signs
      3.21.3.2. Non-movement Area.
          3.21.3.2.1. No additional visual aids required
   3.21.4. The following visual aids are required for operations when the RVR is below 600 feet, except
   where others are specified in the SMGCS plan for that airport.
      3.21.4.1. Movement Area.
          3.21.4.1.1. Stop bar lights
          3.21.4.1.2. Runway guard lights
          3.21.4.1.3. Taxiway centerline lights
          3.21.4.1.4. Clearance bar lights

            3.21.4.1.5. Taxiway hold markings
            3.21.4.1.6. Surface painted direction or location signs
            3.21.4.1.7. Geographic position markings
        3.21.4.2. Non-movement Area.
            3.21.4.2.1. Taxiway centerline lights or taxiing assistance (ex. Follow-me vehicle)

3.22. SMGCS Procedures (ICAO). ICAO SMGCS procedures are not as standardized as FAA. In gen-
eral, ICAO SMGCS procedures for Visibility Condition 3 will be implemented when the RVR is
approaching or less than 400 meters (1200 feet). For many airports, this may also be coincident with, and
announced as, category II or III ILS usage.
     3.22.1. Compliance with ICAO SMGCS procedures and restrictions during Visibility Condition 3, or
     any time category II or III ILS are in use, are not mandatory for USAF personnel. However, to
     enhance the safety of low visibility ground operations, USAF personnel shall follow the guidance in
     the appropriate FLIP AP volume during Visibility Condition 3, or any time category II or III ILS are
     in use, to the maximum extent possible when conducting low visibility operations at these airports.
        3.22.1.1. Implementation and termination will be based on meteorological trends of increasing/
        decreasing RVR values and weather phenomena.
        3.22.1.2. Specific aircrew SMGCS procedures for Visibility Condition 3 (if any) are in the appro-
        priate FLIP AP volume.
        3.22.1.3. When complying with the SMGCS plan during Visibility Condition 3, USAF personnel
        shall use the low visibility taxi route(s) chart(s) for that airport (if available).
            3.22.1.3.1. NOTE: Low visibility taxi route charts for OCONUS locations are not published
            in DoD FLIP or by Jeppesen. When planning to operate from an OCONUS airport with a
            SMGCS plan where Visibility Condition 3 or ILS Category II or III operations are anticipated,
            USAF crews must use any available means to obtain low visibility taxi route charts. This could
            include consulting the host nation Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), host nation
            FLIP, or calling the airport directly. Comply with AFI 11-202 Volume 3 General Flight Rules
            for use of host nation publications.

Section 3F—Aircraft Arresting Devices

3.23. Emergency Arresting Gear. Certain airports are equipped with a means of rapidly stopping mili-
tary aircraft on a runway. This equipment, normally referred to as “Emergency Arresting Gear”, generally
consists of pendant cables supported over the runway surface by rubber "donuts." Although most devices
are located in the overrun areas, a few of these arresting systems have cables stretched over the opera-
tional areas near the ends of a runway.
     3.23.1. Arresting cables that cross over a runway require special markings on the runway to identify
     the cable location. These markings consist of 10 feet diameter solid circles painted "identification yel-
     low", perpendicular to the runway centerline across the entire runway width. Additional details are
     contained in USAF Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 94-01, Standard Airfield Pavement Marking
     Schemes and AC 150/5220-9, Aircraft Arresting Systems for Joint Civil/Military Airports,.

  3.23.2. Aircraft operations on the runway are not restricted by the installation of aircraft arresting
  devices. However, aircraft T.O.’s may restrict operations of a particular mission design series (MDS)
  for taxi, takeoff, and/or landing over a particular type(s) of arresting cables.
3.24. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Forms Prescribed: None.
3.25. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Forms Adopted: AF Form 2519; AFTO Forms 244, 350, and

Terms
Apron (ICAO)—A defined area, on a land aerodrome, intended to accommodate aircraft for purposes of
loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance.
Apron/Ramp (USAF/FAA)—A defined area on an airport or heliport intended to accommodate aircraft
for purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance.
Blast Pad (FAA/ICAO)—An area prior to the beginning of the landing runway designated by the airport
authorities as being unable to support an airplane during a landing. This area may be able to support an
aircraft during taxi and/or take-off.
ILS Critical Area—A designated area on the airfield in the vicinity of the ILS antennas where the
presence of vehicles and/or aircraft on the ground will interfere with airborne reception of ILS signals.
AFI11-218_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2007                                                         97


Aircraft and vehicle access to the Critical Area will be strictly controlled by Air Traffic Control to ensure
integrity of ILS signals whenever the conditions are less than report ceiling 800 feet and /or visibility less
than 2 miles.
Judgmental Over-Steering— When the taxiway centerline does not provide an adequate turn radius, the
pilot may intentionally over-steer the aircraft nose wheel to keep the aircraft’s main gear within the
defined edges of the taxiway.
Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)—Operations which include simultaneous takeoffs and
landings and/or simultaneous landings when a landing aircraft is able and is instructed by the controller to
hold-short of the intersecting runway/taxiway or designated hold-short point. Pilots are expected to
promptly inform the controller if the hold short clearance cannot be accepted.
Low Visibility Operations—Operations conducted at airports when the visibility (RVR) is below 1200
feet (400 meters). Refers to SMGCS operations.
May—Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
Movement Area (USAF/FAA)—The runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport/heliport which are
utilized for taxiing/hover taxiing, air taxiing, take-off, and landing of aircraft, exclusive of loading ramps
and parking areas. At those airport/heliports with a tower, specific approval for entry onto the movement
area must be obtained from Air Traffic Control.
Movement Area (ICAO)—That part of an airport to be used for the take-off, landing and taxiing of
aircraft, consisting of the maneuvering area and the apron(s).
Night Operations—Operations conducted at airports during periods of darkness as defined by FAR Part
1 and AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules. The time between the end of evening civil twilight
and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local
time.
Obstruction (permanent)— Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles parked entirely within a
designated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the
ramp or another suitable means. AGE or vehicles parked in these areas must have a parking brake set,
chocks, or another suitable means to prevent inadvertent movement of the equipment. Adjacent aircraft
are also considered a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in it’s designated
spot and is not moving.
Overrun (USAF)—An area beyond the take-off runway designated by the airport authorities as able to
support an airplane during an aborted take-off. The FAA/ICAO term for this is “stopway”.
Runway Visual Range (RVR) (ICAO)—The maximum distance in the direction of take-off or landing
at which the runway or the specified lights or markers delineating it can be seen from a position above a
specified point on its centering at a height corresponding to the average eye-level of pilots at touchdown.
Runway Visual Range (RVR) (USAF/ FAA)—An instrumentally derived value, based on standard
calibrations, that represents the horizontal distance a pilot will see down the runway from the approach
end; it is based on the sighting of either high intensity runway lights or on the visual contrast of other
targets whichever yields the greater visual range. RVR is based on what a pilot in a moving aircraft should
see looking down the runway. RVR is horizontal visual range not slant visual range. It is based on the
measurement of a transmissometer made near the touchdown point of the instrument runway and is
reported in hundreds of feet.

Shall or Will—Instructions or procedures prefaced by “shall” or “will” are mandatory.
Should—Indicates a preferred but non-mandatory method of accomplishment.
Stopway (FAA/ICAO)—An area beyond the take-off runway designated by the airport authorities as
able to support an airplane during an aborted take-off. The USAF term for this is “overrun”.
Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS)—Operations implemented at selected US
and foreign airports where scheduled air carriers are authorized to conduct operations when the visibility
is less than 1,200 RVR. A SMGCS plan facilitates the safe movement of aircraft and vehicles on the
airport by establishing more rigorous control procedures and requiring enhanced visual aids. This plan
helps insure aircraft and vehicles remain in the areas intended for their use.
Taxi Lane— A designated path marked through parking, maintenance or hangar aprons, or on the
perimeter of such aprons to permit the safe ground movement of aircraft operating under their own power.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change reflects the addition of AFVA 11-240, Airport Signs and Markings (paragraph 3.2.2., 3.2.3.).
Changed or revised material is indicated by a star.
3.2.2. AFVA 11-240 shows selected USAF airport markings and signs identical to those in Section 3C,
3D, and 3E. For units based at USAF installations, display this visual aid where maintenance and flight
related operations take place. Suitable locations are aircraft maintenance work areas and flight line build-
ings frequented by ground and aircrew personnel. This includes vehicles operated on USAF airfields. Ref-
erence AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, for further flight line driving information.
3.2.3. Units located at contingency or foreign airfields use the visual aid (FAA or USAF) that most clearly
depicts the actual markings at the airfield.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2005-1. 1.22.2. and 1.22.3. Text changed to clarify taxi dis-
tances. Figure 3.2. Figure replaced; original was incorrect. 3.21.2. Note added clarifying sources for low
visibility taxi diagrams in the CONUS. 3.22.1.3. Note added clarifying sources for low visibility taxi dia-
grams OCONUS. Attachment 1, Abbreviations and Acronyms. Added terms “AGE” and “AIP” to list.
Attachment 1, Terms. Added terms “judgmental over-steering”, “obstruction (permanent)” and “taxi
lane”. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.
1.22.2. Do not taxi or tow an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers monitoring the
clearance between the aircraft and the obstruction.
1.22.2.1. Locally based aircraft are exempt when fixed taxi routes are marked and the obstruction is per-
manent. See paragraph 1.22.2.1.3. for the definition of a permanent obstruction. This exemption only
applies to locations where aircraft are taxiing into or out of a parking spot. These criteria shall not be
applied on taxiways or taxi lanes where aircraft do not normally park. Taxi routes must be used by the
same model aircraft for which they were designed.
1.22.2.1.1. The exemption and waiver authorities specified in this instruction apply only to existing facil-
ities. Do not apply these criteria in the design of new facilities. UFC 3-260-1 Airfield and Heliport Plan-
ning and Design, establishes design criteria for new facility construction, including waivers to design
criteria.
1.22.2.1.2. NOTE: MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no lower than WG/CC) may waive the requirement
for 25 feet clearance in taxi lanes only, but in no case can this be waived to less than 10 feet between
wingtips and any portion of adjacent aircraft (also see paragraph 1.22.3.1.3.). When the waivered taxi
lines require the aircraft to turn, the waiver can only be applied to aircraft with good visibility of the
wingtips from the cockpit that do not require the use of judgmental oversteering for turns (ex. C-21 or
most fighters).
1.22.2.1.3. NOTE: Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent
obstruction for purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2. through 1.22.3., provided it is parked entirely within a des-
ignated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp
or another suitable means. AGE or vehicles parked in these areas must have a parking brake set, chocks,
or another suitable means to prevent inadvertent movement of the equipment. Adjacent aircraft are also
considered a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in it’s designated spot and is
not moving.
1.22.2.1.4. CAUTION: When designing and marking parking areas as described in paragraphs 1.22.2.
and 1.22.3., MAJCOMs and units must take into account the effects of wing and tail growth, landing gear
geometry, and use of judgmental over-steering during turns, as applicable, to insure clearances are main-
tained during all phases of a turn into or out of a parking spot.

1.22.2.1.5. NOTE: For the purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2. and 1.22.3., locally based aircraft include air-
craft of the same type operating at another base with the same type aircraft, in parking areas specifically
designed for that type aircraft. For example, a KC-135 from Grand Forks AFB ND operating in the
KC-135 parking area at McConnell AFB KS or an F-15 from RAF Lakenheath operating in the F-15 park-
ing area at Seymour-Johnson AFB NC.
1.22.3. Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 feet to any obstruction.
1.22.3.1. This restriction can be waived by the MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no lower than WG/CC)
under any of the following circumstances:
1.22.3.1.1. During contingency operations when compliance would restrict the mission. A marshaller
must be used.
1.22.3.1.2. When operating from alert, readiness, or protective shelters. A plainly visible centerline must
be painted along the exit path. A marshaller must be used.
1.22.3.1.3. Locally based aircraft when operating into and out of parking spots specifically designed for
those aircraft and the obstruction is permanent. These criteria shall not be applied on taxiways or taxi
lanes where aircraft do not normally park, or when environmental or operational conditions (ice, snow,
inoperative systems, etc.) may impact the normal turn performance of the aircraft. Taxi routes shall be
clearly marked. Taxi routes must be used by the same model aircraft for which they were designed. See
paragraph 1.22.2.1.3. for the definition of a permanent obstruction. Parking spots shall be spaced to allow
a minimum of 10 feet clearance between any portion of adjacent aircraft. A marshaller must be used.
1.22.3.1.3.1. WARNING: Paragraph 1.22.3. sets out minimum clearances for aircraft taxiing into and out
of parking spots. These minimums may not be appropriate for all types of aircraft, especially large swept
wing aircraft with limited visibility from the cockpit and/or when judgmental over-steering may be
required for turning (i.e. C-5, KC-10, KC-135, etc.). When turns are required, MAJCOMs will establish
appropriate clearance standards for aircraft where visibility is limited from the cockpit, judgmental
over-steering is required for turning, or there is wing or tail growth during turns.

Judgmental Over-Steering – When the taxiway centerline does not provide an adequate turn radius, the
pilot may intentionally over-steer the aircraft nose wheel to keep the aircraft’s main gear within the
defined edges of the taxiway.


Obstruction (permanent) – Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles parked entirely within a
designated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the
ramp or another suitable means. AGE or vehicles parked in these areas must have a parking brake set,
chocks, or another suitable means to prevent inadvertent movement of the equipment. Adjacent aircraft
are also considered a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in it’s designated
spot and is not moving.


Taxi Lane – A designated path marked through parking, maintenance or hangar aprons, or on the perim-
eter of such aprons to permit the safe ground movement of aircraft operating under their own power.
