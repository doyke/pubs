OPR: 22 MXG/MXQ                                      Certified by: 22 MXG/CC (Col Michael L. Dillard)
                                                                                           Pages: 5

This instruction directs all groups to develop internal policy or procedures to control tools, equipment and
electronic devices from all 22d Air Refueling Wing (ARW) agencies dispatching personnel and equip-
ment to aircraft parking/runway/taxi areas and 22d Maintenance Group (MXG) areas. Tools, equipment
and electronic devices must be controlled to prevent and eliminate foreign object damage (FOD) to air-
craft, engines and support equipment and to reduce costs through strict effective control and accountabil-
ity of assets. References for program concept and development include: AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, Chapter 10, applicable command supplements and 22 MXG MOI
21-18, Consolidated Tool Kit (CTK) Management and Accountability. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will
convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate
functional’s chain of command.

   1.1. Control Areas: Aircraft parking areas, runways, taxiways and MXG maintenance areas.
   1.2. Tools: Hand tools, equipment and electronic devices used to work on or maintain airfield equip-
   ment, facilities, vehicles or aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, land mobile radios, cell
   phones, laptop/hand-held computers, PCMCIA cards and other portable electronic devices commonly
   used in the execution of official duties are considered tools.

2. Tools, Equipment and Electronic Device Program Management Procedures:
   2.1. All units will develop and follow internal procedures to control and manage tools dispatched to
   control areas. These procedures will be briefed as part of initial work center assignment orientation.

    2.2. Groups/squadrons sponsoring contractor activities in control areas must take steps to ensure con-
    tractors are made aware of tool control requirements, briefed on lost tool reporting procedures and
    provided an on-duty squadron point of contact.
    2.3. If tools are routinely dispatched to any control areas on a daily basis, the owning group will
    develop tool control procedures as outlined in AFI 21-101, Chapter 10.

3. Personal Tools:
    3.1. Personal tools (e.g. Mini-Mag type flashlights, Leatherman type multi-tools, knives, etc.) are
    NOT authorized on the flight line or in any control area. Unit issued personal protective items (e.g.
    reflective belts, whistles, ear defenders, etc.) will be properly marked with the last name, unit and
    employee number IAW AFI 21-101, and applicable AMC supplements prior to dispatch/use in control
    areas. The member’s last four social security numbers may be used in lieu of employee number for
    individuals not assigned G081 employee numbers. Aircrew flight required equipment will be
    addressed in AFI 11-2KC-135V3, McConnell AFB Supp 1, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures.
    3.2. Any missing unit-issued item, equipment, tool or personal item (PDA, cell phone, camera, lap-
    top, etc.) carried into these areas will be declared a lost tool and reporting/search procedures will be
    accomplished IAW section 6 of this instruction.

4. Aircrew Life Support (ALS):
    4.1. The following standardized worldwide equipment identifiers have been established for each air
    refueling squadron’s (ARS) ALS tools:
       4.1.1. 350 ARS: MK50XXXXX
       4.1.2. 344 ARS: MK44XXXXX
       4.1.3. 349 ARS: MK49XXXXX
       4.1.4. 384 ARS: MK84XXXXX

5. Tools, Equipment and Electronic Device Accountability Checks:
    5.1. As a minimum, tools, equipment and electronic devices dispatched must be inventoried:
       5.1.1. Upon initial check out.
       5.1.2. Prior to the start of a job.
       5.1.3. Upon completion of a job prior to leaving the job site.

6. Reporting Lost Tools, Equipment or Electronic Devices:
    6.1. Upon discovery, all tools, equipment or electronic devices lost within the control areas will be
    reported by the owner to Command Post (CP) immediately. Initiate a thorough search of the area
    where the missing tool was used.
       6.1.1. CP will record the event and pass specific information to airfield management and mainte-
       nance operations center (MOC).

      6.1.2. 22d Operations Group (OG) leadership and airfield management will make appropriate
      operational decisions based on the effect missing tools may have on the safety of ongoing airfield
      operations.
      6.1.3. MOC will notify the MXG/CC of the lost tool and follow MXG lost tool reporting proce-
      dures established in MXG MOI 21-18.
      6.1.4. For tools lost in control areas other than the MXG, the OG/CC will determine when search
      efforts may be discontinued.
      6.1.5. The group/squadron responsible for the lost tool will appoint a SNCO or officer to lead
      recovery/search actions, coordinate reporting procedures and complete lost tools report documen-
      tation requirements. Final copies of reports for tools lost in airfield control areas (other than MXG
      areas) are to be delivered to airfield management for reference and future report closure.
      6.1.6. Groups/squadrons will develop internal report requirements. The 22 ARW Lost Tool
      Report Template (Attachment 1) can be used as a guide for documenting lost tools. 22 MXG
      Form 21-18, Lost Tool/Object Report, will be used to document all MXG lost tools. This form can
      be found on the 22 MXG intranet website.

7. Reporting Found Tools:
   7.1. Tools found in MXG control areas will be turned in to the 22 MXG quality assurance office for
   lost tool report closure according to MXG MOI 21-18 or action as applicable.
   7.2. Tools found in airfield control areas will be turned in to the airfield management for lost tool
   report closure or action as applicable.

8. Reports of Survey:
   8.1. Squadron commanders will initiate a report of survey when appropriate for lost tools IAW
   AFMAN 23-220, Report of Survey For Air Force Property, and applicable McConnell AFB supple-
   ments.
