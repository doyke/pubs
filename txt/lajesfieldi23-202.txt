SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This version clarifies
updates and streamlines previous guidance and brings it into compliance with AFI 23-201, Fuels
Management, TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft And Static Grounding/Bonding, AFOSH
STD 91-38, Hydrocarbon Fuels—General, AFOSH STD 91-501 and Air Force Consolidated
Occupational Safety Standard.
1. General. 65th LRS/LGRF, Fuels Management Flight, provides all refueling support to aircraft using
the Air Base 4 (AB4) military ramp at Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal. Written guidance for priority
refueling is needed to ensure mission requirements are coordinated and identified in advance.
2. Responsibilities. 65th LRS/LGRF Fuels Management Flight will provide aircraft refueling support
requested by 65th Operations Support Squadron (OSS) and AB4, based on the aircraft’s priority and
then on a first-come, first-serve basis. Priority for Portuguese military aircraft is coordinated through
Air Base 4 Air Traffic Squadron Aircraft Dispatch Section. In the event of adverse weather, refueling

operations will be terminated based on parameters outlined in reference publications listed in first
paragraph.
3. Fuels Servicing Priorities. Priority refueling is weighed in terms of mission requirements, refueling
time involved, aircraft departure time and alert status. The exceptions are Priority 1 and 2 aircraft,
which will be given immediate refueling service and must be identified to Fuels Management Flight
during the initial request.
    3.1. Refueling requests are coordinated through 65th OSS, Portuguese Air Force, and Maintenance
    Operations Control Center (MOCC) (when applicable) to establish priority and ensure refueling
    resources are available. The use of a standardized priority list will assist the Fuels Management
    Flight to provide refueling support to priority aircraft. The following list will be applied as a general
    guide for determining aircraft refueling priorities:
       3.1.1. Priority 1: Distinguished visitors and VIP aircraft/Aero Medical Evacuation (US and Host
       Nation)
       3.1.2. Priority 2: Contract Military Flights (Patriot Express)
       3.1.3. Priority 3: Quick-Turn aircraft (those departing in less than 4 hours)
       3.1.4. Priority 4: Host Nation aircraft
       3.1.5. Priority 5: Aircraft departing same day but remaining more than 4 hours
       3.1.6. Priority 6: Third Nation aircraft
       3.1.7. Priority 7: Transient aircraft departing next day
4. Processing Urgent Service Request. If an agency believes their requirement requires a higher
priority than listed in paragraph 3, contact 65 OSS to coordinate a higher priority.
5. Hydrant Utilization. Hydrant refueling will be used to the greatest extent possible, with a goal of 85
percent usage.
6. Prescribed and Adopted Forms.
    6.1. Adopted Forms: AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publications
