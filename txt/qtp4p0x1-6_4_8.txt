                                        INTRODUCTION

1. This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-
job training for 4P0X1 personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide teachable elements of task
breakdowns. The teachable elements will assist in guiding the trainee towards independent
task performance, proficiency, and serve as an evaluation tool for task certifiers/certification
officials.

2. Review each volume(s) of the Career Development Course (CDC) and identify which
module(s) of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training. The
QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors
the area the trainee is working in. Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Career Field Education
and Training Plan (CFETP) marked with a 5 or 7 are the core tasks for the 4P career field.
Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.

3. Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any task
or QTP evaluation. Review the performance checklist and training objective with the trainee. If
the trainee has questions about the objective, clarify the desired outcome/results of performance,
demonstration or completion for the task. Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize
training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform
the task independently.

4. When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective,
follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate
each task objective. When the trainee successfully demonstrates and accomplishes the objective,
document task completion appropriately in the member’s 6-part training/competency folder.

5. The QTP task completion is to be annotated on an AF Form 1098 Special Task Certification
and Recurring Training, filed in part 3, section A of the 6-part training/competency folder.
NOTE: The individual check lists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s 6-part
training/competency folder. A master checklist is filed in part 3, section A of the Master
Training Plan (MTP) folder.

6. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing remediation.
Conduct feedback for each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in the member’s
6-part training/competency folder. As the trainer, once you are satisfied the trainee is ready to
perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.

7. If a task being trained requires third party certification by a task certifier/certifying official,
the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently. The trainee will then
be evaluated by certifier/certifying official. Tasks requiring third party certification are
identified in column 2 of CFETP with a number sign (#). The third party certifier will ensure
documentation in column 3E of the CFETP) and finally documented appropriately in the
members’ 6-part training/competency folder.

8. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job
position training. Such standardization benefits the CFETP training concept throughout a
member’s career. These documents also may be used in assessing/certifying pharmacy
technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.

9. Feedback is a vital and important part of improving our educational process for pharmacy
technicians. You first hand expertise is valued and feedback highly encouraged ensuring we
have the most up-to-date information and training possible. Please direct all inquires to: your
immediate supervisor.

SUBJECT AREA: Inpatient Pharmacy

TASK NAME(S): Maintain Crash Carts

CFETP/STS REFERENCE(S): 6.4.8

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
  1. Crash Cart Tray
  2. Neonatal/Universal Code Blue Control Log
  3. Security Bag
  4. Medications

TRAINING REFERENCE(S): JCAHO Standard MM 2.30
                       AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management

REMARKS/NOTES: None

OBJECTIVE:

1. Build and track code tray.

2. Inspect code cart.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.   After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task.

2. Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished without
assistance and without error.

3. Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s 6-part
training/competency folder. Initial evaluation should be documented in the CFETP. All
recurring evaluations should be documented on AF Form 1098.

STEPS IN TASK PERFORMANCE:

1. Building a Code Tray

1.1. Choose a new Pediatric/Universal code blue control log (see attachments).

1.2. Start with a tray that has been returned to the pharmacy.

 1.3. Refer to new control log and check expiration dates and quantities; replenish as necessary
and sign when finished.
                  Maintaining Crash Carts or Emergency Administration Sets

 1.4. Tray is then verified against what is written on new control log for accuracy by checker and
signed once it is correctly filled.

1.5. Seal up entire tray with a security bag with the perforated tear on the top.

1.6. Once tray has been sealed with security bag put in storage area for dispensing.

2. Tracking a Code Tray

 2.1. Check code tray book prior to performing inspection to verify which tray, lock number and
expiration date the department should have on the ward/clinic. Annotate the tray number, lock
number, and expiration date on monthly inspection checklist (see attachment).

 2.2. If the tray is expired or will expire before the next scheduled inspection replace the tray. If
the tray is replaced annotate the form with the new tray and lock numbers along with expiration
date. Be sure upon returning to pharmacy that you update the new information on that particular
ward/clinic’s code tray master tracking sheet.

3. Inspecting a Code Cart

 3.1. Ensure code tray on ward/clinic coincide with item 2.1. If not write down on inspection
checklist (item 1) the number tray, expiration date, and/or lock number found. Be sure upon
returning to pharmacy that you update the correct information of tray, expiration date, and lock
number found on specific ward/clinic code tray master tracking sheet (see attachment).

 3.2. Open each drawer of the code cart, checking for expired pharmaceuticals, i.e. Cetacaine
spray, Lidocaine jelly 2%, and IV fluids. Check any dated items for expiration and if it belongs
in drawer at all.

 3.3. Expired pharmaceuticals are taken back to the pharmacy and replaced with unexpired stock
before inspection is completed. IV fluids are replaced and all outdated items are returned to
pharmacy for destruction. Annotate on inspection checklist number 8 that the “Standard was Not
Met”. Under the remarks section itemize the pharmaceuticals that were expired, expiration date,
and their quantities. Annotate that the items were replaced if applicable.
