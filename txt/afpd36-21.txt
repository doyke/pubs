SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This policy directive has been modified to include new definitions and policy statements as to how Per-
sonnel Tempo is factored into the utilization of Air Force Personnel. New metrics have also been
included in the revision

1. Qualified people with the needed skills must be in the right job at the right time to meet the Air Force
mission. At the same time, the Air Force has a responsibility to keep attuned to the demands placed on its
members resulting from personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO). Consequently, the Air Force classifies and
assigns people worldwide as equitably as possible to ensure a high state of readiness. The Air Force also
recognizes a need for special assignment considerations to take care of Air Force people with exceptional
needs. The following policies balance and accomplish these objectives:

2. The Air Force will use a coherent and logical classification system to identify valid manpower require-
ments, to identify and describe each Air Force occupational specialty, to ensure minimum prerequisite
standards are set for each specialty, and to ensure qualified individuals are placed into each specialty.

3. While the primary consideration in selecting personnel for reassignment, either permanently (PCS) or
temporarily (TDY) is the member’s qualifications to accomplish the mission, there are additional impor-
tant factors to be considered.
   3.1. To the maximum extent possible, the Air Force will assign individuals on a voluntary basis and
   in the most equitable manner feasible.
   3.2. The Air Force will equitably distribute involuntary assignments among similarly qualified per-
   sonnel, factoring PERSTEMPO where practical to minimize family separation and to avoid creating a
   severe personal hardship on the member.
   3.3. Because of the impact of TDY on effective management of Air Force resources and on individual
   members, 120 days TDY per person in a 12-month period is the desired maximum.
   3.4. Procedures may be established to reduce PERSTEMPO following lengthy TDYs.
   3.5. Limitations on involuntary selection of personnel for PCS, following some TDYs, may be estab-
   lished to allow members to attend to essential military and personal pre-PCS requirements as well as
   to reduce individual and family turbulence.

4. When personnel are reassigned permanent change of station, or public funds are used for education or
training courses, personnel will incur an obligated service commitment to ensure a fair return on the costs
involved.

5. Terms Explained
   5.1. Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO). Personnel Tempo is a quality of life measurement that mea-
   sures the amount of time an individual spends away from his or her home station for operational and
   training purposes which includes TDY and designated dependent-restricted PCS assignments. Indi-
   viduals serving on designated unaccompanied tours are counted as “deployed” for PERSTEMPO pur-
   poses whether they have dependents or not. The desired maximum number of days TDY per person
   in a 12-month period is 120.
   5.2. Temporary Duty (TDY). When members are directed to perform duty on a temporary basis at a
   location other than their permanent duty station, their status is recorded using TDY orders and entitle-
   ments or allowances accrue as authorized.
   5.3. Permanent Change of Station (PCS). Movement of a member to a different permanent duty sta-
   tion, with or without concurrent change in unit of assignment.

6. The following responsibilities and authorities are established:
   6.1. Headquarters US Air Force is responsible for policy oversight and advocacy of Air Force utiliza-
   tion and classification programs, for monitoring PERSTEMPO, and for interface with the Office of
   the Secretary of Defense staff concerning development of Department of Defense policy and legisla-
   tive initiatives. The Assistant Secretary for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Environ-
   ment (SAF/MI) discharges this responsibility for the Secretary of the Air Force.
   6.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (HQ USAF/DP) develops, coordinates, and executes
   personnel policy and essential procedural guidance for the management of utilization and classifica-
   tion programs, as well as articulating the impacts of PERSTEMPO on the force.
   6.3. MAJCOMs may establish procedures to reduce PERSTEMPO following lengthy TDYs.
   6.4. The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) develops and issues instructions to factor PERSTEMPO
   in assignment selection and implement active duty assignment programs for lieutenant colonels and
   below, as well as enlisted personnel. AFPC provides PERSTEMPO data to Defense Manpower Data
   Center for archiving and analysis. In addition, AFPC issues classification instructions for these
   people and reports oversight data to HQ USAF/DP.
   6.5. The General Officer Group (AFGOMO) oversees all aspects of utilization for general officers
   and general selectees serving on extended active duty while the Colonels' Group (AFDPO) does like-
   wise for all colonels and colonel selectees serving on extended active duty.

                                                 2
   6.6. The Commander of Air Force Reserve (HQ AF/RE) prescribes end strength management,
   assignment, and utilization procedures, and issues implementation instructions for members of the Air
   Force Reserve. HQ USAF/RE manages the Air Force Reserve Full Time Support programs (includ-
   ing Air Reserve Technicians, AGRs, 5 USC civilians, and Regular AF members to the AF Reserve)
   and approves personnel actions for officers and airmen assigned under Title 10, United States Code,
   Sections 10211 and 12310.
   6.7. Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command manages peacetime utilization and classification pro-
   grams for Selected Reserve unit members.
   6.8. The Air Reserve Personnel Center manages peacetime utilization and classification programs for
   members of Air Force Reserve individual programs.
   6.9. The Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF) prescribes end strength management, assignment,
   and utilization procedures and issues implementation instructions for members of the Air National
   Guard. NGB/CF also manages the Air National Guard Statutory Tour program.

7. Before requests for waivers and exceptions to Air Force military personnel management policies go to
the Secretary of the Air Force, who holds sole approval authority, HQ USAF/DP evaluates them to ensure
they are in the best interests of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force may delegate approval in
this area.
   7.1. See attachments 1 & 2 for measures used to comply with this policy and for related documents
   and interfacing publications.

                          MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A1.1. Compliance with utilization and classification policy will be assessed for lieutenant colonels and
below by measuring five areas:
   A1.1.1. Vacant positions
   A1.1.2. Time On Station (TOS)
   A1.1.3. TDY Waivers/Curtailments
   A1.1.4. Active Duty TDYs
   A1.1.5. Dependent-Restricted Tours

NOTE:
Measurements will be accomplished by AFPC on a quarterly basis, to include an analysis or discussion of
any identifiable trends.

A1.2. Vacant positions. The Air Force goal is to fill all funded authorizations with assigned personnel
(figure A1.1 and figure A1.2).

A1.3. Time on Station. TOS requirements are established to stabilize the lives of members and their
dependents and to reduce PCS costs. The data applies to officer and enlisted TOS waivers (figures A1.3
and A1.4).

A1.4. TDY Rates. Air Force goal is not to exceed 120 days TDY per person per year (figures A1.5
through A1.7).

A1.5. Individuals serving on designated unaccompanied tours are counted as “deployed” for PER-
STEMPO purposes whether they have dependents or not. (figures A1.8 and A1.9)
