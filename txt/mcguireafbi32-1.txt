                                                Chapter 1

               THE AF RESOURCE RECOVERY AND RECYCLING PROGRAM

1.1. Objectives. The objectives of the DOD mandated program are:
    1.1.1. To reduce Municipal Solid Waste Disposal from McGuire AFB in accordance with guidelines
    set forth in AFI 32-7005AMC1, Environmental Protection Committees, Section 3.1.2., goals to be
    established for each calendar year, culminating in a municipal solid waste diversion rate of 40% by the
    end of FY 2005.
    1.1.2. To create positive attitudes and change the behavior of our people toward recycling in order to
    ensure a quality environment for future generations.
    1.1.3. Improve implementation and enforcement of sensible waste handling guidance and continuous
    public education, thereby changing attitudes and habits about recycling.
    1.1.4. To improve the overall quality of life for Air Force personnel and help generate revenue to
    recover RRRP costs, support non-appropriated fund activities, and to avoid excessive disposal costs
    of solid waste materials.
    1.1.5. To comply with Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.

1.2. Policy.
    1.2.1. Recyclable products which are generated, collected and stored by Air Force Activities on
    McGuire AFB become government property and must be disposed of through the RRRP.
    1.2.2. Only RRRP personnel or designees will transport Air Force collected recyclable products off
    base when properly transacted and documented. Base personnel may transport industrial scrap recy-
    clable materials to Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO) with proper documentation.
    Products identified as recyclable must be recycled.
    1.2.3. Contact the McGuire AFB RRRP Office or the Recycling Center Manager to arrange removal
    of large quantities of recyclable products or to schedule a weekly pickup. Recyclable material, as
    defined in Chapter 4 of this instruction, may also be dropped off at the appropriate area of the Recy-
    cling Center (2321 Radin Road) between the hours of 0800-1600, Monday through Friday, except on
    holidays.

1.3. Terms.
    1.3.1. Nonrecyclable paper and housing material contaminants: Carbon paper, built-in carbon, milk
    cartons, candy wrappers, cigarette wrappers, waxed paper, metal clips, envelopes, gummed labels,
    adhesives, rubber bands, slick or photographic type paper, onion skin paper, tissue paper, excessive
    dirt, map material, and cardstock. (Staples are considered a minor contamination that is acceptable;
    however, remove plastic and metal bindings.)
    1.3.2. Recyclable Material: Material that has been or would normally be discarded, and may be
    reused after undergoing some type of physical or chemical processing. Recyclable materials do not
    include scrap material containing precious metal and those items which may be used again for their
    original purpose or function without any special processing. Three categories of potentially recyclable
    materials are defined:
MCGUIREAFBI32-1 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                           3


     1.3.2.1. General Waste: Items falling into this category are from office, shipping/receiving and
     residential (housing) and include various paper products, cardboard, aluminum and steel cans,
     glass and plastic containers, scrap wood, certain used vehicle or machine parts, scrap metal, furni-
     ture, electrical components, used oil and solvents, and certain unused containers of lubricants or
     solvents.
     1.3.2.2. Industrial Scrap: Materials which are recyclable but cannot be included in the RRRP are
     military equipment, ships and planes, or any part thereof, or scrap from maintenance, fabrication
     or other industrial processes directly supporting military equipment, and includes precious metals
     and exotic alloys. Such material must undergo demilitarization, dismantling or mutilation prior to
     sale by DRMO.
     1.3.2.3. Classified Material: All material that is classified Confidential, Secret, Top Secret or
     other Security Act classifications shall be handled and destroyed in accordance with Air Force and
     National Security specifications. Shredded material resulting from such procedures may be recy-
     cled if feasible.
  1.3.3. Recycling: The process by which recovered materials are transformed into new, usable prod-
  ucts.
  1.3.4. Refuse: Garbage, ashes, debris, trash, and rubbish considered rejected, useless, or worthless
  matter. Does not include explosives, incendiaries, classified materials, radioactive materials, and liq-
  uid waste.
  1.3.5. Source Separation: The separation of recyclable material at the point of generation by the gen-
  erator.
  1.3.6. Waste Petroleum Products: Includes refined motor oil, diesel fuel, JP-4, JP-8, and PD-680
  (recycled via contract).
  1.3.7. Synthetic Liquid Products: Includes synthetic motor oils such as: Mobil 1, certain transmission
  and hydraulic fluids, or a mixture containing one of these oils or fluids.
  1.3.8. Halogenated Solvents: Includes tetrachloroethylene, methylene chloride (or dichloromethane),
  trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane (or methyl chloroform), carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene,
  or any mixture containing one of these Halogenated solvents.
  1.3.9. Nonhalogenated Solvents: Includes xylene, acetone, toluene, methyl ethyl ketene, or any mix-
  ture containing one of these non-halogenated solvents.

                                                Chapter 2

                                       REASONS TO RECYCLE

2.1. Compliance. To comply with Public Law 97-214 10 United States Code, Section 2577; New Jersey
Administrative Code 7:26-1 et seq; AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program, and Executive Order
#13101; The AMC Solid Waste Program Standard; DoD and Air Force Policy.

2.2. Environmental Benefits. An aluminum beverage container thrown on the side of the road could
take 80-100 years to decompose. A glass container will essentially never decompose.
    2.2.1. Saves Energy. The energy saved by recycling one aluminum beverage container is enough to
    keep a 100-watt bulb burning for 3Â½ hours.
    2.2.2. Conservation. Newsprint and paper products come from a valuable resource-our forests. For
    every ton of recycled newsprint, 20 trees are saved. Newspapers found in landfills have shown little or
    no decomposition even after 30 or more years.
    2.2.3. Saves Landfill Space. We can increase the life of our landfills by transferring items from the
    waste stream to the recycling stream.
    2.2.4. Reduce solid waste disposal costs. Even for materials that do not generate sale proceeds, signif-
    icant disposal cost savings may be achieved by source separation.
    2.2.5. Community Involvement and Positive Attitude. Recycling gives everyone a chance to take a
    positive, community-minded step, both at work and at home, to contribute to a socially responsible
    program.

2.3. Economics. Recycling creates new jobs. Since 1970, an estimated 100,000+ jobs in buying, process-
ing, and transporting recyclable materials have been created.
    2.3.1. Base Economics. All money generated from the sale of recyclable items from McGuire AFB is
    used to defray the cost of the recycling program. Any excess money can fund environmental projects,
    recreational equipment, services, and events which might not otherwise be funded.

have account 59F3875.8900.528200 on the AF Form 2005. This will ensure that in the event DRMO clas-
sifies the material as scrap, the proceeds from the sale will be returned to the McGuire AFB RRRP.

4.14. Unserviceable Excess. When any organization turns in unserviceable excess to the local DRMO,
they will stamp funds code 59F3875.8900 528200 on the DD Form 1348-1A. This will ensure that in the
event DRMO classifies the material as scrap, the proceeds from the sale will be returned to the McGuire
AFB RRRP.

                                               Chapter 5

                                              GENERAL

5.1. Sale. Recyclable materials may be sold by the RRRP to individuals, processors, and community
organizations, when:
   5.1.1. The materials were not government purchased or generated.
   5.1.2. The materials, while owned or generated by DoD and Air Force, have been shown to be uneco-
   nomical for government supported collection or disposal through DRMO.

5.2. Funding and Proceeds Distribution. The Wing FMB will determine RRRP fund distribution based
on the Air Force Recycling Guidance: âRecycling proceeds generated from the direct sale of nonappropri-
ated fund-owned (Services and AAFES) and DeCA material will be returned to the respective organiza-
tion. Recycling proceeds returned to the installation from the Defense Reutilization Marketing Service
and from direct sales of appropriated fund material will first be used to recover appropriated fund costs
incurred managing and operating the RRRP to include but not limited to: manpower, equipment, utility,
and real property costs. After appropriated fund cost reimbursement, the installation commander may use
up to 50 percent of the remaining sale proceeds for pollution abatement, energy conservation, and occu-
pational safety and health activities. Projects may be funded up to 50 percent of the cost of a minor con-
struction project. Any remaining proceeds may be transferred to the Morale, Welfare and Recreation Fund
to be used for base morale, welfare and recreation activities. Accounting for recycling proceeds and the
distribution thereof shall be in accordance with Air Force Instructions.

5.3. Ownership. Accumulation of solid waste for recycling purposes, which has been generated, col-
lected and stored on McGuire AFB, is government property and must be sold through RRRP.

5.4. Future Recyclables. The materials designated for recycling in this regulation are by no means all
inclusive. The RRRP office will keep all base personnel updated on additions to the recyclable materials
list.

5.5. Curbside Collection: In base residential areas will continue.

5.6. Compliance: Organizations are subject to inspection or audit by the EPC for solid waste disposal
area compliance. Non-compliance may result in action by the EPC, with potential loss of fund eligibility.
