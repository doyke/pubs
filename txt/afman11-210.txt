                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General Concepts. The USAF Instrument Refresher Program (IRP) is a two-part program designed
to provide USAF aircrews with the knowledge, procedures and techniques required to achieve safe and
effective worldwide mission accomplishment when operating under Instrument Flight Rules. Part 1 is the
USAF Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). This recurring requirement is primarily an interactive class-
room based training event conducted IAW this instruction, AFI 11-202 Vol 1, Aircrew Training, and MAJ-
COM guidance. Part 2 is the written instrument examination. This open book examination of USAF,
MAJCOM and MDS-specific instrument regulations and publications is a requisite of the Instrument
Flight Evaluation and will be accomplished IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202 Vol 2, Aircrew Stan-
dardization/Evaluation Program.

1.2. Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. HQ AFFSA. HQ AFFSA will:
       1.2.1.1. Publish AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program (IRP).

       1.2.4.2. Ensure the unit’s IRP is current and relevant to the unit's mission.
       1.2.4.3. Create IRC examinations from the most current AFFSA Instrument Exam Test Bank.
       1.2.4.4. Notify HQ AFFSA/XOF of any necessary changes to the AFFSA Instrument Exam Test
       Bank.
       1.2.4.5. Establish a reference library of instrument-related publications.

1.3. Compliance.
    1.3.1. Attendance. All pilots on active flying status must complete the IRC every fourth quarter after
    completion IAW this instruction, AFI 11-202 Vol 1, and MAJCOM guidance. For example, if this
    training is completed in the first quarter of the year (Jan, Feb or Mar), it must be completed no later
    than the first quarter of the following year. (e.g. If completed 15 Jan 05, next IRC to be completed by
    31 Mar 06). Other crewmembers are required to attend the IRC on this same schedule if mandated by
    AFI 11-202 Vols 1 and 2, MAJCOM guidance, or unit policy.
       1.3.1.1. AIS Attendance. Successful completion of the AIS curriculum satisfies IRC completion
       for that particular cycle.
    1.3.2. Method of Instruction. The IRC will be taught in a classroom format by a qualified IRC instruc-
    tor in accordance with this instruction and applicable MAJCOM supplements. Simulator profiles and/
    or CBT programs specifically designed for IRC training may be used for IRC classroom credit as indi-
    cated below. No other form of instruction (CBT, videotape, box of slides, self-study, etc.) is authorized
    as a sole means of IRC completion..
       1.3.2.1. CBT. Computer Based IRC training will utilize a MAJCOM reviewed, HQ AFFSA
       approved product.
    1.3.3. Course Length. The IRC will be at least six hours in length. Time spent taking the examination
    does not count towards the six-hour course length.
       1.3.3.1. Simulator Credit. If the unit IRC program includes simulator training profiles specifically
       designed for IRC training, then up to two hours of the IRC may be spent in a simulator as class-
       room credit.
       1.3.3.2. CBT Credit. Completion of approved CBT may fulfill up to four hours of the IRC class-
       room requirement. Any CBT program will be supplemented with a minimum of 2 hours of
       Instructor Based Training (IBT). Aircrew who complete a CBT program will provide completion
       certificate to IRC instructor.
       1.3.3.3. Combination Credit. The unit IRC may incorporate both CBT and IRC specific simulator
       profiles. This method will fulfill up to 5 hours of the IRC classroom requirement. A minimum of
       one hour of IBT is required if utilizing a combined IRC program.
       1.3.3.4. IBT Requirements. When using simulator and/or CBT for IRC classroom credit, the fol-
       lowing, as a minimum, must be covered during the IBT portion: new and revised regulations/
       instructions, unit designated and AFFSA IRP Home Page “Hot Topics” as well as local instrument
       trends and procedures.
AFMAN11-210 3 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                                5


   1.3.4. Course Content. As a minimum, the IRC will contain instruction in each of the following
   required categories: new or revised regulations/instructions, instrument procedures, flight planning,
   weather, and spatial disorientation.
       1.3.4.1. Units possessing aircraft equipped with head-up displays (HUDs) must also cover items
       found in the lesson plan titled "The Head-Up Display (HUD)." (Lesson plan is on the HQ AFFSA
       IRP Home Page.)
       1.3.4.2. Hot Topics. Prior to teaching each IRC, the IRC instructor will check the HQ AFFSA IRP
       Home Page and cover any briefing items found in the "Hot Topics" section.

1.4. Instructor Qualification.
   1.4.1. Instrument School Graduate. IRC instructors must be graduates of the Air Force Advanced
   Instrument School (AFAIS) at Randolph AFB, TX; SIFC/AIFC formerly at Castle AFB, CA; or IPIS
   formerly at Randolph AFB, TX. In the event a unit is without an AFAIS, SIFC/AIFC, or IPIS gradu-
   ate, HQ AFFSA will entertain waivers to this instruction on a case-by-case basis. (Additional infor-
   mation in paragraph 1.8.)
   1.4.2. Instructor Pilot (IP). IRC instructors must be an instructor pilot (IP) or have an equivalent level
   of experience. The intent is to have pilots teach others about instrument flying; therefore, the actual
   IRC instructor will be an IP or have been previously qualified as an IP.
   1.4.3. Contract instructors may teach the IRC. Contract IRC instructors must attend AFAIS if not pre-
   vious AFAIS, SIFC/AIFC, or IPIS graduates.
   1.4.4. Guest speakers from weather, ATC agencies, flight surgeon's office, etc., are highly encour-
   aged. Every effort should be made for an aerospace physiologist or flight surgeon to present spatial
   disorientation and related situational awareness topics. The IRC instructor will ensure guest speaker
   presentations are timely and directly relevant to flight operations.

1.5. IRC Course Development.
   1.5.1. Unit-Level Development. The most appropriate level for IRC course development is at the unit
   level. Operational commanders and unit-level IRC instructors are in the best position to accurately
   judge the strengths and weaknesses of their unit's pilots. The primary objective of the IRC should be
   to provide your aircrew with sufficient knowledge and techniques to cope with any instrument proce-
   dure they may encounter safely. Most pilots are pretty good at mastering the normal departure and
   arrival at their home base, especially if they’ve been assigned to the base for a while. These normal
   day-to-day type operations should not be the basis for your IRC. The following guidance should help
   you decide what to cover in an IRC.
       1.5.1.1. The IRC should refresh the aircrew with information that is not seen on a daily basis.
       Review and reinforcement is required on a regular basis if an aircrew's instrument knowledge is to
       remain at least at the UPT graduate level. You should be striving to raise your unit's instrument
       knowledge to a level above that.
       1.5.1.2. Procedures and information that have changed since the last IRC.
       1.5.1.3. Reinforcement of problem areas the wing staff, Stan/Eval, training officers, Air Traffic
       Control, base operations personnel, weather personnel, flight surgeons, etc. have identified as
       weak areas.
6                                                                 AFMAN11-210 3 FEBRUARY 2005


       1.5.1.4. Any instrument procedures the Wing deems necessary to ensure successful accomplish-
       ment of the mission.
    1.5.2. CBT Development. MAJCOMs will ensure that all CBT products are developed IAW DOD
    and AF directives and applicable 36-series regulations.
    1.5.3. Simulator Profile Development. Simulator capabilities range widely based on MDS, and can be
    invaluable training tools. Regardless of whether basic or maximum fidelity, a simulator profile specif-
    ically designed for IRC training provides one of the best methods to reinforce safe instrument proce-
    dures and concepts. This “hands on” session shall not be one ILS approach at the end of an Emergency
    Procedure (EP) Simulator. That is a wasted opportunity. On the contrary, while including EP’s in the
    IRC simulator is a valuable and encouraged technique (e.g. Special Departure Procedures (SDPs), if
    applicable), other examples would be a pending deployment route and terminal procedures, divert
    base approach information, missed approach procedures and techniques (few pilots have accom-
    plished "real" missed approaches), local divert base familiarity, ATC SIDs, Obstacle Departure Proce-
    dures (ODP) etc… As you can see, this list is not all-inclusive, but does offer some ideas for
    structuring an IRC specific simulator profile.
    1.5.4. Sources of Academic Course Material. Academic material for the IRC can come from virtually
    anywhere. Here are just a few sources of IRC academic material:
       1.5.4.1. HQ AFFSA IRP Home Page. The HQ AFFSA IRP Home Page is the central reference
       point for all IRP information. The site will contain the most current AFFSA Instrument Examina-
       tion Test Bank, sample outlines for individual IRC courses, and briefings used by the HQ AFFSA
       IRC Roadshow. All material can be downloaded and used by the IRC instructor in developing the
       unit IRP program. The home page will also provide links to other sites offering instrument-related
       information. (Additional information in paragraph 1.9.)
       1.5.4.2. AF Advanced Instrument School (AFAIS). The instructors at AFAIS can also provide a
       great deal of information helpful to IRC instructors. Contact AFAIS at DSN 487-6047 or visit the
       AIS website:
       https://www-r.randolph.af.mil/12ftw/12og/ais/.
       1.5.4.3. MAJCOMs may develop IRC course materials (i.e. CBT or MDS specific simulator pro-
       files) for use by unit-level IRC instructors.

1.6. Requisite Instrument Examination.
    1.6.1. The purpose of the requisite instrument examination is to provide an extensive open-book
    review of instrument procedures and other instrument-related subjects.
    1.6.2. The administration and successful completion of the requisite instrument examination is IAW
    this instruction and AFI 11-202 Vol 2.
    1.6.3. AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank. HQ AFFSA/XOF will maintain the AFFSA
    INSTRUMENT EXAMINATION TEST BANK in electronic format. The test bank will be available
    for download via the HQ AFFSA IRP Home Page. Copies of the IRC test bank may also be received
    via e-mail or traditional mail (upon request).
       1.6.3.1. Changes to individual questions in the AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank are not
       authorized. Questions will not be used if changes in source material render the question invalid.
AFMAN11-210 3 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                            7


      1.6.3.2. IRC instructors will act as unit conduit for deficiencies and updates to questions in the
      AFFSA Instrument Examination test bank. IRC Instructors will utilize AF Forms 847 and the pro-
      cess outlined in AFI 11-202 Vol 2 to notify HQ AFFSA/XOF of any necessary changes to the
      questions or answers contained in the AFFSA Instrument Examination test bank.
   1.6.4. Unit Instrument Examination Test Bank. The unit instrument examination test bank includes
   the AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank and any locally developed questions as described in
   paragraph 1.6.5.
      1.6.4.1. The IRC instructor is responsible for the currency of the unit’s instrument examinations.
      1.6.4.2. As a minimum, the IRC instructor will ensure the latest version of the AFFSA Instrument
      Examination Test Bank (as indicated on the HQ AFFSA IRP web page) is available before gener-
      ating any requisite instrument examinations.
      1.6.4.3. The IRC instructor will ensure the review of the unit instrument examination test bank is
      accomplished IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2.
   1.6.5. Requisite Instrument Examination Content. The requisite instrument examination will contain
   a minimum of 50 questions. 40 questions will be taken from the AFFSA Instrument Examination Test
   Bank in the following proportions:
      1.6.5.1. 15 questions - AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures
      1.6.5.2. 10 questions - AFI 11-202 Vol. 3, General Flight Rules
      1.6.5.3. 10 questions - Flight Information Publications (FLIP)
      1.6.5.4. 5 questions - AFH 11-203 Vols 1 & 2, Weather for Aircrews
      1.6.5.5. The remainder of the examination's questions will be developed locally. The questions
      must cover instrument-related areas and may be taken from MAJCOM flight directives, supple-
      ments, aircraft tech orders, or local flying directives. The additional questions can be written by
      the unit, written by the MAJCOM, taken from the AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank, or
      a combination of all three methods.
   1.6.6. Testing Conduct. The requisite instrument examination, as detailed above, shall be completed
   as one event, not broken up into multiple tests over time.

1.7. Improvement Recommendations.
   1.7.1. Use the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication to recommend a change to
   this publication.
