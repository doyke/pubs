This instruction updates 37th Training Wing (37 TRW) Instruction 90-201, Self-Inspection
Program. It establishes policy for conducting the 37 TRW Self-Inspection Program and applies
to all 37 TRW organizations. This instruction expands upon policies and procedures as outlined
in AFI 90-201, Inspector General (IG) Activities and, AFI 90-201 AETC Supplement, Inspector
General Activities. It outlines responsibilities, lists procedures for use of inspection checklists
and disposition of deficiencies and establishes the frequency of self-inspections. Overall
responsibility for the program rests with the 37 TRW Commander; however, actual operation
and management of the Self-Inspection Program is delegated to the subordinate offices specified
in this instruction. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
Units or the Air National Guard (ANG). Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This Instruction deletes all references to the 37th Mission Support Group and 37th Medical
Group. No significant changes have been made. However, the eight-step problem solving
model, deficiency codes, and SIP reporting procedures have been added.
1. CONCEPT. Self-Inspection is an internal management tool, which enables organizations to
identify and correct management deficiencies and noncompliance with directives. A formal self-
inspection program documents deficiencies and assists in resolving problems either locally or by
elevation to the appropriate level. Serious and repeat deficiencies can be systematically resolved
through conscientious and regular use of the program, resulting in increased effectiveness of the
organization. Every effort should be made to reduce the administrative burden of unit self-
inspection programs. The self-inspection program should be an active, ongoing effort at all
levels of supervision and is not an administrative exercise that is implemented in the face of
known unit vulnerability to a higher headquarters inspection. However, a thorough review of the
program would be in order prior to such an inspection.
2. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:
     2.1. The 37 TRW Inspector General’s Office (37 TRW/IG) is responsible for overall
     operation and management of the 37 TRW Self-Inspection Program.
     2.2. Group/deputy commanders and wing staff agency chiefs will maintain a viable self-
     inspection program.
     2.3. Squadron self-inspection program management. Squadron commanders are responsible
     for the management of the self-inspection program within their organization. One or more
     squadron levels of supervision may be required in large organizations. The number of
     squadron-level monitors will be determined by the squadron commander.
     2.4. Squadron level self-inspection monitors.       These individuals, designated in an
     appointment letter by the squadron commander, are responsible for conducting self-
     inspections of his/her functional area and managing the squadron self-inspection program.
     Normally, the lowest level supervisor having a direct function will be the person actually
     performing the self-inspection; however, in small units, a single self-inspection monitor may
     be appointed.
3. TYPES OF DEFICIENCIES:
     3.1. Limiting Factor (LIMFAC). A discrepancy that limits or impedes the unit's ability to
     accomplish its mission, but is beyond the unit's ability to correct. LIMFACs must be
     identified to higher levels of command.
     3.2. Critical Deficiency. Any deficiency that results or could result in widespread mission
     impact or failure.
        3.2.1. Immediately notify the 37 TRW/IGI of all critical deficiencies.
     3.3. Significant Deficiency. A validated deficiency that has or could have significant
     mission impact.
37TRWI90-201 18 JANUARY 2011                                                                     3


     3.3.1. Any deficiency (critical, significant, or minor) previously identified in another
     inspection (Self-Inspection, Staff Assistance Visit (SAV), Higher Headquarters (HHQ)
     inspections, etc) and still unresolved, but correctable at the unit level.
     3.3.2. Minor deficiencies of the same type found throughout the unit representing an
     unfavorable trend.
     3.3.3. All Fraud Waste and Abuse (FWA), Safety or Health, and Repeat deficiencies
     could be categorized as a Significant Deficiency.
  3.4. Minor Deficiency. A validated deficiency that does not meet the definition for a
  Critical or Significant Deficiency but requiring corrective action.
4. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
  4.1. Self-Inspection Program Binder:
     4.1.1. Purpose. The self-inspection program binder provides a single source of reference
     for self-inspection materials and is a tool for identifying, documenting, and reviewing
     progress of corrective actions for problem areas.
     4.1.2. Format. Maintain self-inspection program binder either in electronic or paper
     format. In either format, ensure that each record series item is identified on the office file
     plan; disposition labels for each series must be affixed at the location of the record.
        4.1.2.1. Section 1 - Table of Contents.

       outlined in the Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) Playbook (or
       SAF/SO approved publication) leading to identification of root causes and solutions to
       deficiencies. All deficiencies will be assigned a deficiency code IAW Attachment 3.
           4.1.3.1. Maintain the spreadsheet in the self-inspection program binder under Section
           6 to keep track of all deficiencies and current status.
           4.1.3.2. Deficiency reviews will include a commander review of all critical and
           significant deficiencies.
              4.1.3.2.1. Group/squadron commanders and staff agency chiefs will review
              deficiencies every 90 days until all deficiencies are closed.
              4.1.3.2.2. 37 TRW/CC reviews deficiencies on an annual basis until all
              deficiencies are closed.
    4.2. Frequency of Inspections. Each unit will perform an annual self-inspection during the
    period of 1-31 May each year. However, more frequent inspections may be directed by the
    37 TRW Commander, Group Commander, or Squadron Commander.
       4.2.1. Self-Inspections will include applicable checklists, SII, CII, and CEI. Include the
       current status of all open deficiencies from recent HHQ inspections, SAVs, and previous
       self-inspections conducted within the 37 TRW.
       4.2.2. Approval to substitute a HHQ SAV/inspection report for a local self-inspection
       will be at the discretion of 37 TRW/IGI. Written requests will be sent to 37 TRW/IGI for
       approval of the substitution request.
       4.2.3. Self-Inspection Reporting. Report results of the self-inspection through squadron
       level to applicable group self-inspection program manager. The report contains copies of
       spreadsheets for all deficiencies, eight-step process, and include a cover sheet
       summarizing inspection results to include LIMFACs, Critical and Significant deficiencies
       and signed by the commander (Attachment 2).
       4.2.4. 37 TRW/IGI staff will determine when the inspection results are due to their
       office. Group and wing staff agency self-inspection program managers will, in turn route
       to the 37 TRW/IGI staff, overall inspection results IAW Attachment 2 and 3. Highlight
       any LIMFACs, Critical or Significant Deficiencies and any recommendations for 37
       TRW/CC review.
5. PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES:
    5.1. 37 TRW/IGI will:
