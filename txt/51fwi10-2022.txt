This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness and
complements Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-10.1, Integrated Base
Defense (IBD). The Installation Arming and Response Program is the application of the IBD
initiative. Contingency operations require all defensive operations to function IAW current
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures developed upon lessons learned and tailored to counter the
threats poised against our installation. It establishes the roles and responsibilities of 51 FW
personnel, standardizes the defensive operations terminology and provides strategic direction for
unit commanders to plan for and implement base wide arming and response to hostile threats.
All Osan AB operating locations must plan for the arming and integration of all
Airmen/personnel into the base defense plan. It must take into account limitations in training
and personnel (such as types of weapons and Geneva Convention status) and balance the threat
response against the requirements of the operational Osan AB and Combined Forces Korea
mission. Integration of defensive operations and communication is critical to reduce potential of
fratricide incidents, increase unity of effort and the defeat of hostile forces that pose a threat to
Osan resources and personnel. This instruction applies to all personnel assigned, attached, or
associated with the 51 FW. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
supersedes 51 FWI 10-250, 15 June 2007. Battle stations (BS) are manned by units or as
directed by the Defense Force Commander (DFC). Sector Command Post (SCP) was changed to
Combined Defense Operations Center (CDOC). The DFC is granted limited power to dispatch
installation personnel out of their BS. If installation personnel are expected to counter an
asymmetric threat, it is necessary for the DFC to make rapid decisions in response to a dynamic
fast enemy force. The DFC will implement withdrawal plans or dispatch personnel away from
their BS in emergency situations or after coordinating with the installation commander.
Attachment 4, Battle Station Postures was added.

                                            Chapter 1

                  ORGANIZATION, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Organization and Authority. The purpose of Integrated Defense (ID) is to establish a
“seamless defense” by integrating technology, personnel, and procedures to “see first, understand
first, and act first” against enemy forces. The teaming of ID contributors will create a seamless
defense effect that is stronger than the defense efforts of individual contributors (Air Force
Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness). Accordingly, Installation Commanders must
organize, train, and equip their installation to neutralize or deter a threat so the operational Air
Force and Combined Forces Korea mission is not interrupted or does not cease.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities. Force protection responsibility is inherent to command, and
each unit/tenant commander must assume responsibility for the defense of their personnel and
resources IAW the guidance provided from Wing Command personnel.
     1.2.1. 51st Fighter Wing Commander (51 FW/CC) is responsible to:
        1.2.1.1. Establish 51 FWI 10-2022 to provide guidance to commanders on their ID roles
        and responsibilities.
        1.2.1.2. Provide intent to the DFC and Group Commanders for the implementation of
        Installation Arming and Response (IA&R) guidance.
        1.2.1.3. Implement a standard IA&R postures and direct Battle Station Postures (BSPs)
        through Battle Staff Directives (BSD) or other command channels. This action will
        usually be based on guidance from the DFC and the Threat Working Group (TWG) who
        analyze threat and provide recommendations to counter threats.
     1.2.2. Group commanders are responsible to:
        1.2.2.1. Participate in Integrated Defense Council (IDC) meetings and implement Fighter
        Wing guidance.
        1.2.2.2. Provide limitations and capabilities to 51 FW/CC and DFC through the IDC to
        ensure unity of effort for the defense of Osan AB.
        1.2.2.3. Re-allocate resources (manpower and equipment) to ensure critical resources
        and facilities are adequately protected.
     1.2.3. 51 SFS/CC is appointed the DFC for Osan AB and is responsible for the following
     actions:
        1.2.3.1. Assume primary tactical control of all Osan defense forces and act as the
        primary coordinating authority with defense zone 1 and 2 commanders to ensure the
        defense of Osan AB and inbound/outbound assets.
        1.2.3.2. Prepare IA&R information and program present updates at the TWG, Force
        Protection Working Group (FPWG) and the IDC. The IDC is the primary meeting for
        IA&R discussions.
        1.2.3.3. Update, 51 FWI 10-2022 if changes/updates are required.
        1.2.3.4. Provide Osan AB units with support in the following areas:
51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011                                                                      5


         1.2.3.4.1. Conduct surveys of installation facilities areas to provide defense in depth.
         Survey should be done by the Physical Security/Installation Security Council and
         Wartime Operations NCOIC.
         1.2.3.4.2. Conduct follow up surveys as required ensuring improvements are made to
         BSs and communications systems between BSs and Security Forces (SF).
         Communication from the BSs to the Unit Control Centers (UCCs) is the
         responsibility of the owning unit. BSs are defined as positions/shelters that are
         manned by Airmen/combined forces in the event of an enemy attack. (e.g. Defensive
         Fighting Position, DFP’s.)
         1.2.3.4.3. Conduct Basic Ground Combat Skills Training for IA&R personnel. This
         two day class includes weapon training as outlined in AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms
         Program and AFMAN 36-2227, Vol. 1, Combat Arms Training Programs Individual
         Use Weapons and other locally generated courses of fire.
         1.2.3.4.4. Provide sufficient slots for fire arms training through combat arms to
         ensure readiness of unit personnel to perform their responsibilities for IA&R.
         1.2.3.4.5. Integrate BS into the 51 FW OPLAN 31-1(S), Combined Defense Plan(S).
         1.2.3.4.6. Provide perimeter detection and denial IAW 51 FW OPlAN 31-1(S).
         1.2.3.4.7. Establish procedures that ensure continuous communication between the
         BS and the Security Force Squadron (SFS) response forces.
  1.2.4. Unit Squadron Commanders are responsible to:
     1.2.4.1. Provide information to the 51 SFS IA&R program managers on the capabilities,
     limitations and manning of their unit to meet the intent of this publication. *Minimum
     required amount of IA&R trained Airmen E-6 and below will depend on each squadron’s
     security needs (i.e., number of facilities and layout). However the required minimum
     amount will be 30%, but 50% is the recommended amount. This will ensure units are
     prepared to cover shortfalls for leave or casualties.
     1.2.4.2. Appoint a Battle Station Manager (BSM) in the grade of E-6 or above. The
     BSM will represent the unit on all IA&R matters also will be the single point of contact
     for implementation and planning of defensive operations.
     1.2.4.3. Appoint alternate BSM in the grade of E-5 or above to serve during the absence
     of the primary BSM. Note: A single appointment letter can be done appointing both the
     BSM and the alternate BSM. Refer to Attachment 3 of this instruction for appointment
     letter template.
     1.2.4.4. Develop a unit instruction directing IA&R organization and procedures. This
     instruction will be provided to 51 SFS/S3W to ensure integration of efforts between units.
     1.2.4.5. Ensure personnel assigned to BS have received firearms training IAW AFI 31-
     207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel and AFI 36-2226. Installation
     arming and response forces are arming group B.
     1.2.4.6. Implement IA&R actions when instructed by DFC or higher command levels
     through BSDs or appropriate communication channels.
 6                                                              51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011


        1.2.4.7. Ensure personnel performing IA&R/BS duties are adequately trained and
        equipped. It is the responsibility of the unit to procure individual equipment,
        ammunition, and weapons. Request for support may be made to 51 FW but the
        responsibility remains with the unit to ensure personnel are ready to integrate into
        defensive operations.
        1.2.4.8. Ensure BS supplies are on hand and personnel are aware of the procedures for
        building required defensive portions. Supplies required include but are not limited to:
        Sandbags, barriers, concertina wire and communication equipment.
        1.2.4.9. Ensure safe storage and protection of firearms and munitions IAW AFI 31-101,
        Integrated Defense and AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.

                                             Chapter 2

                                     TACTICAL CONCEPT

2.1. BSP. The Air Force provides combat power in the domains of air and space. Base defense
is a necessary command function of the Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) to
provide the “security” principle of war on the ground, where air and space power is most
vulnerable. The installation must be able to increase its force protection capabilities by shifting
focus of assigned combined forces from their primary duties to perform tasks when the threat
dictates. BSPs prepare the installation to anticipate/react to the threat by mobilizing and
readying resources and personnel in an integrated defense effort. Manning battle stations must
account for the need to continue Osan AB’s operational mission even when under attack if the
mission requires it. However, all personnel must be capable of defending themselves as the
situation requires and all personnel must know where to go for safe shelter from attack.
Additionally the guidance provided in this instruction is consistent with the guidance provided in
51 FWI 31-101, Osan AB Installation Security Instruction (PA) (FOUO) and 51 FW OPLAN 31-
1, Combined Defense Plan(S). This information is provided in a separate instruction ensuring
clarity and thorough understanding of the roles and missions assigned to commanders, unit
points of contact and individual Airmen.
     2.1.1. 51 FW/CC will direct BSPs through BSDs or other appropriate communication
     channels. Upon initiation of BSPs, unit commanders will man their BSs with trained
     personnel ready to defend their facilities and areas.
2.2. BSP Definitions.
     2.2.1. BSP Whiskey - In a routine threat environment, the base defense responsibility of all
     combined forces is to maintain situational awareness and report suspicious activity. Random
     antiterrorism measures (RAMs) are utilized to continually vary the force protection posture
     of the installation as directed by AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT).
        2.2.1.1. Security Forces personnel are the main detection and response force to hostile
        incidents.
        2.2.1.2. All Osan personnel should detect threats of suspicious activity.        Report of
        suspicious activities must be called into CDOC or UCC.
        2.2.1.3. Units prepare to stand up BSs and prepare personnel to perform their IA&R
        duties.
        2.2.1.4. Figure A4 1. Through Figure A4.6 in attachment 4 of this instruction build
        upon this basic picture and reflect the emplacement of defensive measures such as DFPs
        and concertina wire. Additionally, the figures show the manning changes as we escalate
        from BSP Whiskey to higher BSPs.
     2.2.2. BSP X-Ray - As the threat increases, so must base defense responsibilities shared by
     all combined forces. If intelligence indicates enemy plans and capability are to infiltrate the
     installation perimeter with saboteurs or suicide bombers, or an increased insider threat
     becomes more predictable, then an installation should arm some or all of its personnel to
     increase the installation’s ability to thwart an attack, causing the enemy to abandon their
     plan.
51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011                                                                       9


      2.2.2.1. Security Forces personnel are the main detection and response force to hostile
      incidents.
      2.2.2.2. Key BSs are manned by units or as directed by the DFC. An example of a BS is
      an Entry Control Point (ECP), DFP or unit facility. These BSs should be approximately
      25% of the total BSs possessed by the unit and should be the key observation/challenge
      posts for critical facilities.
      2.2.2.3. All Osan personnel contribute to the defense through detection. Reports of
      suspicious activities must be called into the CDOC or UCC. Personnel are informed of
      the latest intelligence and are poised to assume their BSs when directed by 51 FW/CC.
      2.2.2.4. Units continue to prepare implementation of remaining BSs and ensure readiness
      of personnel to perform their IA&R duties.
   2.2.3. BSP Yankee - In response to increased tensions or credible threat of penetrative base
   attacks by ground, air, or a combination of the two attack methods, most of the force should
   be armed. Close defense shelters/positions should be constructed/partially manned at each
   defended locale, cluster of facilities or individual facility so enemy forces will encounter an
   integrated, de-conflicted base fire plan.
      2.2.3.1. Security Forces personnel are the main response force to hostile incidents.
      2.2.3.2. Key BSs are manned based upon the percentage directed by 51 FW/CC. These
      BSs include potential primary/secondary targets for hostile forces along with the key
      observation/challenge posts for critical facilities or as directed by the DFC.
      2.2.3.3. Report of suspicious activities must be called into CDOC or UCC. Personnel are
      informed of the latest intelligence and are poised to assume their BSs when directed by
      51 FW/CC.
      2.2.3.4. Units complete preparations for implementation of remaining BSs and ensure
      readiness of personnel to perform their IA&R duties.
   2.2.4. BSP Zulu - In the event of an actual or imminent ground or air attack that may directly
   impact the mission of combined forces, only those personnel executing a mission critical task
   approved by the installation commander should continue with their duties. All others should
   either take shelter or man planned defensive positions.
      2.2.4.1. Security Forces personnel assume response force duties as their primary mission
      to neutralize and defeat opposition forces.
      2.2.4.2. BSs are manned by units at the direction of the 51 FW/CC based on available
      manning. These BSs should be expanded to include potential primary/secondary targets
      for hostile forces along with the key observation/challenge posts for critical facilities.
      2.2.4.3. All Osan personnel contribute to detection through IBD. Report of suspicious
      activities must be called into the CDOC located in their area and UCC. Personnel are
      informed of the latest intelligence and are prepared to defend their BSs.
      2.2.4.4. All preparations of BSs cease until BS Yankee is instituted.
2.3. BSP in conjunction with Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs) and Mission Oriented
Protective Postures (MOPP) Conditions.
 10                                                               51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011


   2.3.1. While these postures appear similar to FPCONs, or “Alarm Conditions” which are
   contained in the Osan AB “Ability to Survive and Operate” (ATSO) guide, they are distinct
   since they give the installation commander the flexibility to rapidly communicate changes to
   the installation’s ability to defend itself from an enemy attack.
2.4. Unit Facility Defense.
   2.4.1. The BSPs will affect each unit/facility differently based on the resource and the
   mission of each unit/facility. Every Airman will have a BS based on their BSM’s and
   commanders’ operating instruction for unit/facility defense. The depth of each defense plan
   will be dictated by the resource’s vulnerability and the affect the resources loss has on the
   mission. During BSP Zulu all BSs will be manned. Hangar type facilities will be locked
       and an armed guard from the BSM will protect the single point of entry. Security Forces
   will serve as a quick reaction force for these types of facilities. Office facilities/compounds
   will have BSs that are armed and man DFPs and ECPs to defend the facility/compound. The
   rest of the personnel will shelter in place and notify the CDOC. Security Forces will serve as
   a quick reaction force for these types of facilities/compounds. Dormitories facilities will
   require residents to report any activity to the CDOC and remain inside dormitories.
   Immediately report sightings and Security Forces personnel will respond as required.
2.5. Defended Locales/Clusters. In the event of an enemy attack, each facility must have a
sheltering plan for personnel and a plan to provide final BS defense at vital assets. In the event
an asset is not defendable or not vital to the operational mission, it may be abandoned rather than
defended, provided owner/user agencies have a plan for their personnel to be protected
elsewhere. Since close defense incorporates the use of weapons and the engagement of enemy
forces, the DFC must centrally control close defense planning/execution but the principle of
decentralized execution allows unit commanders for each resource to execute their portion of the
plan in coordination with the DFC, CDOC and their respective Base Security Operations Area
Supervisor (BSOAS). During hostile action the CDOC in conjunction with Security Forces
BSOASs must exercise command and control of non-SF defensive positions to prevent fratricide.
   2.5.1. If enemy attack is likely, each facility/resource must have a plan on how to provide
   final defense and a plan to shelter personnel in the event of attack. This plan should
   emphasize expedient cover and concealment and the best location for personnel to take cover
   and get accountability.
2.6. Command, Control and Communications (C3). C3 within each defended locale/cluster
is paramount to the successful execution of Installation Arming and Response BSP. Once the
CDOC has received a comprehensive SALUTE (size, activity, location, uniform, time, and
equipment) report from the sending BS, the appropriate Security Forces combat force will
respond to engage and terminate the enemy forces. UCCs should ensure BSs have contacted the
CDOC, and perform other notifications through their appropriate communications/operational
chain of command. This emergency reporting is designed to ensure the DFC has the necessary
situational awareness to prevent fratricide and ability to counter enemy activity. NOTE:
Notifying higher/parallel levels of command, though important, before the CDOC, will delay
swift response of combat forces and may result in significant losses in terms of both resources
and lives.
51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011                                                                     11


   2.6.1. Notification from BS to the CDOC will ensure expedited response and allow location
   and interdiction of hostile forces by Security Forces Response Teams. Communication of the
   SALUTE information and speed in transmission of the information is essential.
   2.6.2. The DFC is granted authority to dispatch installation personnel outside of their BS.
   Since all installation personnel are required to counter an asymmetric threat, it maybe
   necessary for the DFC to rapidly redeploy IA&R forces to different locations. The decision
   to dispatch relocate IA&R personnel will meet the following criteria:
       2.6.2.1. The dispatch of installation personnel is in response to a time critical rapidly
       evolving situation.
       2.6.2.2. Dispatching installation personnel does not immediately jeopardize the security
       of the BS unless the new mission is higher priority resource in immediate jeopardy.
       2.6.2.3. Failure to dispatch installation personnel would likely result in an enemy force
       reaching and capturing a BS, key facility or other high value target.
   2.6.3. Notification of BSP changes should be provided to all base personnel through radios,
   networks, and public address announcement (e.g., Giant Voice). The response is not
   intended to be stealthy but clear and expedient. Rapid implementation is crucial.
   2.6.4. Units must immediately inform the CDOC, when battle-stations are posted and ready
   to defend or when battle-stations are no longer posted or able to defend. Notification of BSP
   changes will be provided.
2.7. Plans and Procedures. Initial surveys will be completed by SFS Subject Matter Experts
and unit representatives. These surveys must be updated as conditions change such as relocation
of mission assets to another facility changing the importance assigned to the facility/area.
   2.7.1. 51 SFS/S3W will be the focal point for assisting units with maintaining their surveys
   with current information and recommending improvements to increase the survivability of
   the IA&R forces.
   2.7.2. Updating surveys may affect the defenses around the facility’s BSs. 51 SFS/S3W will
   coordinate these actions with other units that are affected by changes. Integration of all BSs
   into a seamless defense-in-depth envelope will ensure interdiction and neutralization of
   hostile forces posed against Osan AB.
   2.7.3. Unit Operating Instructions must be updated as improvements are made. As this
   concept matures, continuity will be crucial to ensuring the success of Osan’s Airmen in rapid
   transition from Armistice Operations into Wartime Operations.
   2.7.4. Air Force, Army and Combined Forces personnel who are given protected status
   under the Geneva Convention (e.g., medical, chaplain) must be restricted to their role under
   the treaty. For example, medical personnel can defend their patients and immediate facility,
   but only in self-defense. Expanding their role would revoke their protected status and could
   result in international repercussions.
2.8. Exercises. Osan AB will exercise this plan annually as a minimum to ensure
awareness/proficiency. As Osan AB experiences higher threat levels, it is recommended this
plan be exercised more frequently. The exercises can be incorporated into the base’s
antiterrorism exercises, Peninsula exercises, or at the discretion of the installation commander.
 12                                                            51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011


These exercises should integrate/coordinate with local/host nation law enforcement/internal
security authorities and combined defense forces as appropriate
2.9. BS Defense Concepts.
   2.9.1. DFP: As described in AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual serves the primary purpose
   of protecting personnel from hostile small arms fire, while allowing them to effectively fire
   at enemy in their area of responsibility (AOR).
   2.9.2. Primary DFPs: These are the DFPs that are located along key avenues of approach
   and should be situated in a manner that allows challenge/engagement of opposition forces
   before the hostile forces may bring effective small arms fire to bear.
   2.9.3. Situate the DFP to allow the front of the DFP to face toward the avenue of approach.
   Ensure secondary positions will allow observation to the sides of the DFP preventing
   opposition forces to maneuver around the DFP and attack from the rear. The entrance/exit
   must be located to the rear and should be situated to conceal/protect friendly forces if they
   are forced to withdraw. Note: Withdrawal exposes personnel to direct small arms fire in
   most instances.
   2.9.4. Secondary Positions: DFPs situated to provide defense-in-depth and all-around-
   defense are considered secondary positions as they are manned only after primary positions
   are manned. These positions may be as elaborate as a Primary DFP or can be placed to take
   advantage of barriers such as concrete barriers, ditches or other obstacles. The same dangers
   exist from small arms fire and increases the danger from rocket propelled grenades or heavy
   weapons. Withdrawal from these positions will expose defense forces to direct small arms
   fire and should only be done when the situation demands or competent authority directs this
   action.
51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011                                                                       13

                                     ISSUE OF WEAPONS

3.1. Weapons Issue. The positive control and accountability of all weapons and ammunition is
vital. Leadership at all levels is responsible for carefully planning and monitoring this effort to
ensure weapons are handled and employed in a safe and effective manner. The Combined
Defense Plan addresses accountability procedures for both weapons and munitions.
   3.1.1. The installation Combined Defense Plan must address when weapons will be issued
   and how they will be issued by the installation Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) if they
   are stored in a warehouse.
3.2. Unit commanders must be proactive in identifying their unit’s weapons and munitions
that are currently possessed. Most units will find significant limiting factors due to lack of
weapons and munitions. Work around solutions will be required until acquisition actions have
been completed.
   3.2.1. Proper identification of requirements will lead to planning for IA&R, requisition of
   required weapons and munitions, and full implementation of the IA&R concept.
   3.2.2. 51 LRS is responsible for safe weapons storage if the unit does not possess an
   approved weapon storage facility. Each unit is responsible for accounting for their weapons.
   3.2.3. Unit representatives must go to 51 LRS (equipment liaison office) to fill out an AF
   Form 601, Equipment Action Request and provide justification for the number of weapons
   needed for unit personnel.
   3.2.4. Munitions are required for each weapon type possessed by the unit and sufficient
   munitions must be possessed to allow Osan AB to defend our facilities/areas until re-supply
   is achieved.
   3.2.5. Unit representatives must go to 51 MUNS to open a munitions account for
   ammunition if an account does not exist.
3.3. Use of Force (UoF). AFI 31-207, is the reference that establishes requirements for the
training of all personnel requiring this and fire arms training.
   3.3.1. Considerations for the Use of Deadly Force. When possible, give an order to “HALT”
   (Chung-Ji in Korean), before discharging a firearm to prevent death or serious bodily harm to
   others. Military members who violate this prohibition are subject to administrative or
   disciplinary proceedings under Article 92, Uniformed Code of Military Justice.
 14                                                           51FWI10-2022 29 JUNE 2011



3.4. Wartime Rules of Engagement. Wartime ROEs come in to affect when the Commander,
United Nations Command /Combined Forces Command orders. These rules do not limit a
commander’s inherent authority and obligation to use all necessary means available to take all
appropriate action in self-defense of the commander’s unit and other friendly forces in the
vicinity. All combat operations ROE will comply with The Law of War at all times. The
specific wartime ROEs are outlined in the Combined Defense Plan.
