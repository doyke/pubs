                                           Chapter 1

                             POLICY AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for operating USAF SUAS.
AFI 11-502, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations, volumes 1, 2, and 3 draw from the
respective AFI 11-202, Flying Operations volumes 1, 2, and 3, with modifications tailored to
Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems; knowledge of the AFI 11-202 series is highly encouraged in
order to fully understand the parallels and differences between systems and their supporting
instructions.
     1.1.1. AFSOC is designated Lead Command for Groups 1-3 UAS (generally referred to as
     SUAS: see table A5.1). Unmanned Aircraft (UA) of all descriptions fly in the same
     environment as manned aircraft. UAS operators must follow rules and procedures, as closely
     aligned as fielded technology permits, to those followed by crews of manned aircraft.
     Coordinating SUAS with other manned/unmanned aircraft and surface fire support/maneuver
     units requires detailed integration and understanding of the tactical environment.
     1.1.2. Units do not have the authority to obligate the Government to purchase, lease,
     procurement, or contract of any new Air Force SUAS to include UA, Ground Control Station
     (GCS), Remote Video Terminal (RVT), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), or any other
     payload prior to coordination with SAF/AQIJ. Include AFSOC/A5KJ, AFSOC/A3OU, and
     MAJCOM/A3 as information addressees. Exceptions: Air Force Material Command (AFMC)
     need not coordinate for unfielded test systems and USAFA need not coordinate for unfielded
     systems for the purpose of conducting research.
1.2. Key Definitions:
     1.2.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. ―Should‖ indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
     1.2.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
1.3. SUAS Operator. An individual, qualified and responsible for the safe ground and flight
operation of the unmanned aircraft and onboard systems. A single SUAS-O will be specifically
identified by responsible authority as the Lead SUAS-O. The Lead SUAS-O, regardless of rank,
is equivalent to the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) of a manned aircraft and is responsible for all
aspects of the mission, regardless of crew position. A SUAS mission includes equipment
preparation, planning, briefing, ground and air operations, recovery, mission debriefing, and
equipment accountability.
     1.3.1. Most units operating SUAS are not traditional flying squadrons; for this reason, this
     volume is intended to be a common source of directives applicable to SUAS operations, to
     include, but not limited to:
        1.3.1.1. Air Force-specific guidance.
        1.3.1.2. Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs).
        1.3.1.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended
        Practices (SARPs).

       1.3.1.6. This volume provides broad guidance and cannot address every conceivable
       circumstance. SUAS-Os are expected to use their best judgment in order to ensure safe
       conduct of SUAS operations.
1.4. SUAS Equipment Custodian. Equipment custodian will be identified in writing by the
Squadron Commander. The individual will ensure SUAS equipment is secured and accounted for
appropriately IAW the equipments’ level of sensitivity. Maintain an account on SUASMAN and
keep all equipment status up-to-date. Individuals will be trained prior to conducting field-level
repairs on SUAS equipment.
1.5. Compliance.
   1.5.1. The SUAS-O will comply, as applicable, with the following:
       1.5.1.1. This volume and MAJCOM guidance.
       1.5.1.2. UAS Group-Specific instructions and supplements.
       1.5.1.3. Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) applicable to SUAS when operating within
       the United States to include the airspace overlying the waters out to 12 miles from the US
       coast, unless the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has excluded military
       operations.
       1.5.1.4. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended
       Practices (SARPs) applicable to SUAS in international airspace over the high seas,
       military mission permitting.

       Publications (FLIP) Area Planning (AP) and General Planning (GP) documents and the
       Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). Theater commanders must ensure the content of FLIP
       accurately convey the rules of each nation within their area of responsibility when
       different from this instruction.
       1.5.1.6. ICAO SARPs when operating in a nation whose rules are not published.
       1.5.1.7. Procedures and special notices in FLIP, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), aircraft
       technical orders, Air Force directives, MAJCOM directives, and Air Traffic Control
       (ATC) instructions.
       1.5.1.8. Contractor requirement to comply with Air Force UAS guidance must be
       stipulated in contracts.
       1.5.1.9. UAS leased or loaned to Air Force organizations will be operated in compliance
       with Air Force guidance.
   1.5.2. MAJCOM Supplements. MAJCOM supplements shall not be less restrictive than this
   instruction. MAJCOM supplements to this instruction must be coordinated with HQ AFFSA
   prior to publication IAW AFPD 11-5. MAJCOMs will forward copies of supplements to

1301, Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) and Navigation Safety system performance and
software development processes for non-civil type certificated aircraft must either satisfy civil
standards or provide an equivalent level of safety and performance. FAA Advisory Circulars
(ACs) and Technical Standard Orders (TSOs) provide civil standards for the Certification and
Operational Approval of GATM and navigation safety systems.
1.7. “Properly Certified” Aircraft. In many cases this AFI uses the term ―properly certified‖
in lieu of listing all applicable civil equipment and integration standards for CNS/ATM and
Navigation Safety systems. The term ―Properly Certified‖ indicates the aircraft systems comply
with appropriate FAA ACs and TSOs or provide an equivalent level of safety and performance.
A list of required civil standards may be obtained from the AFFSA web site
(https://www.mil.tinker.af.mil/affsa/affsa.html – see CNS System Requirements) or aircraft
certification matrices maintained by ESC/GA.
1.8. Waiver Authority. Unless otherwise specified, HQ AFFSA/A3O is the waiver authority
for this instruction. Waivers to the basic guidance in this instruction will be requested through
applicable operations channels to MAJCOM/A3, or equivalent level. MAJCOM/A3s will
forward request in message or memo format to HQ AFFSA/A3O, with a copy to HQ
AFSOC/A3OU. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled by the MAJCOM agency that
generated the supplement. Unless otherwise specified in AFI 11-5 UAS Group-Specific, Volume
3, MAJCOM/A3s are the waiver authority for specific individual SUAS crewmember operations
requirements. When the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) utilizes resources of the
306th Flying Training Group (FTG) (AETC), AETC is the parent MAJCOM. Waivers to this
instruction will not exceed 12 months. Units assigned, attached, or under operational control of a
combatant commander will request waivers through the Commander, Air Force Forces
(COMAFFOR) who may approve, disapprove, or forward to HQ AFFSA/A3O for action.
     1.8.1. HQ AFFSA will approve waivers to this instruction only when:
        1.8.1.1. Compliance with this instruction creates a hazard.
        1.8.1.2. An essential MAJCOM requirement makes a waiver necessary.
     1.8.2. MAJCOMs. MAJCOMs may authorize a waiver to this instruction without prior
     approval from HQ AFFSA, if doing so is ―essential to the defense of the United States‖
     because of a military emergency or an urgent military necessity. MAJCOM designated
     representatives will notify HQ AFFSA within 72 hours of authorizing a waiver at
     hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil or DSN 339-9783. Unless otherwise specified in appropriate
     AFI 11-5GP(1, 2, or 3)-SUAS, Volume 3, MAJCOM/A3 is waiver authority for operational
     procedures. Delegation of waiver authority is at MAJCOM discretion.
     1.8.3. Waiver Process. HQ AFFSA will provide only written waivers. Units requiring a
     waiver will follow the procedure listed below:

      through Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), Internet sources, or as
      disseminated locally.
      2.1.1.13. Operational Environment Assessment. An assessment as to the operational
      viability which may or may not be based on one or more factors (e.g., intel, weather,
      legal, C2, terrain, SA).
   2.1.2. Due Regard. In international airspace, when operationally necessary, SUAS-Os are
   authorized to conduct military flight operations with due regard for the safety of navigation
   of civil traffic IAW FLIP GP ―Operations and Firings over the High Seas.‖ Due Regard
   operations may be conducted under the following restrictions:
      2.1.2.1. In Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC); or
      2.1.2.2. Within radar surveillance and under positive communication control of a surface
      or airborne radar; or
      2.1.2.3. Outside the limits of controlled airspace.
2.2. Fuel/Battery Charge Requirements.
   2.2.1. General Information. The SUAS-O will ensure sufficient fuel/battery charge is
   available on board the aircraft to comply with the requirements of this instruction and safely
   conduct the flight. Before takeoff the aircraft must have enough usable fuel/battery charge
   aboard to complete the flight to a final landing, either at the destination airport or landing
   zone or the alternate airport (if one is required), plus the fuel reserves. (Exception: Group 1
   SUAS have no alternate airport or reserve fuel requirement and are exempt from the
   requirements of paragraphs 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. Land the UA before reaching minimum useable
   battery capacity.)
   2.2.2. Alternate Airport Required. Reserved for future operations.
   2.2.3. Fuel Reserve. The SUAS-O must ensure the aircraft is carrying enough usable fuel on
   each flight to increase the total planned flight time between refueling points by 10 percent
   (up to a maximum of 45 minutes for fixed wing or 30 minutes for helicopters) or 20 minutes,
   whichever is greater. To compute fuel reserves:
      2.2.3.1. For reciprocating engine-driven aircraft and helicopters, use fuel consumption
      rates for normal cruising altitudes.
      2.2.3.2. For turbine-powered aircraft use fuel consumption rates that provide maximum
      endurance at 10,000 ft. Mean Sea Level (MSL).
      2.2.3.3. If the MAJCOM authorizes holding (instead of an alternate airport) for a remote
      or island destination, do not consider the prescribed holding time as part of the total
      planned flight time for computing fuel reserve.
   2.2.4. Flight Logs. The following are the approved types of flight logs:
      2.2.4.1. AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log.
      2.2.4.2. MAJCOM-approved form.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                      13


      2.2.4.3. Approved computer-generated flight log. The lead command will approve flight-
      planning software to meet SUAS group-specific training and operational requirements.
      2.2.4.4. Flight planning computations annotated on a navigation chart.
   2.2.5. Minimum/Emergency Fuel Advisory. When operating in FAA airspace, SUAS
   operators will declare minimum/emergency fuel to the controlling agency when in their
   judgment the aircraft may land at the intended destination with less than the required
   emergency fuel reserve.
2.3. Weather.
   2.3.1. The SUAS-O will obtain sufficient weather information to safely conduct the flight
   and comply with this instruction. Units employing SUAS should refer to the Flight
   Information Handbook (FIH) for Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) contact information.
   When necessary, record the appropriate weather information on a DD Form 175-1, Flight
   Weather Briefing. The following weather sources are authorized:
      2.3.1.1. US Military Weather Services.
      2.3.1.2. Approved weather sources listed in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction
      or UAS Group-Specific, Volume 3.
   2.3.2. SUAS-O of Group 1 UAS are exempt from the weather briefing requirements of
   paragraph 2.3.1. Group 1 SUAS-Os must have reasonable cause to believe that the local
   weather conditions will permit successful employment and operations will be in compliance
   with applicable range directives, operations orders, FAA Certificates of Authorization
   (COA), or other governing directives.
   2.3.3. Weather Considerations. All SUAS mission planning requires careful attention to
   weather and its effects on the UA during flight operations; particular attention should be paid
   to temperature, winds, precipitation, and hazardous weather phenomena. These factors
   include, but are not limited to:
      2.3.3.1. Wind effects on launch, navigation legs, loiter, and landing. Operators must keep
      in mind small unmanned aircraft avionics may be more sensitive to turbulence.
      2.3.3.2. Wind effects on acoustic signature of the UA at the target.
      2.3.3.3. Effects of thermals on altitude, station-keeping and image stability.
      2.3.3.4. Restrictions to visibility (fog, smoke, haze, precipitation, sun angle) and effects
      on observation of the UA and UA sensor capability.
      2.3.3.5. Timing and effects of thermal crossover on sensor ability.
      2.3.3.6. Temperature extremes and its effects on aircraft, payloads, and batteries.
      2.3.3.7. Effects of high humidity on internal and external payloads (sensors).
      2.3.3.8. Effects of precipitation on payloads, batteries, and electronics.
      2.3.3.9. Hazardous weather (i.e., thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, clouds, precipitation,
      and poor visibility during launch and recovery) pose hazards to SUAS operations. Present
      SUAS design and payload limitations do not include any sort of weather avoidance
      system; SUAS-Os rely on forecast weather and personal observations.

2.4. Briefings.
   2.4.1. The lead SUAS-O must ensure each crewmember is briefed on items affecting safety
   or mission completion. These briefings will include, but need not be limited to:
       2.4.1.1. Emergency procedures.
       2.4.1.2. Airspace/working area and frequencies authorized for operations and method of
       complying with restrictions.
       2.4.1.3. Precautions and restrictions.
       2.4.1.4. Special procedures and instructions for use during training, formation, or
       operational missions.
       2.4.1.5. Prohibitions listed in paragraph 2.5.
   2.4.2. Briefing Guides. MAJCOMs may develop briefing guides. Use of briefing guides is
   not mandatory, but all applicable items in the briefing guides must be adequately briefed by
   the SUAS-O or other members of the crew. Units may augment these guides as required for
   mission accomplishment.
   2.4.3. Briefing Times. Start briefings in sufficient time to complete the briefing prior to
   flight operations.
   2.4.4. Mission Brief. All crewmembers scheduled to fly the mission will receive a mission
   briefing prior to assuming control of the UAS.
       2.4.4.1. Brief an alternate mission for each flight (if applicable).
       2.4.4.2. Mission elements and events may be modified and briefed while the UA is
       airborne as long as changes do not compromise flight safety. Do not fly non-briefed
       missions and/or events. The SUAS-O will ensure all crewmembers acknowledge all
       changes.
   2.4.5. Mission Debrief. After changeover or landing, debrief all missions.
2.5. Prohibitions. The following prohibitions apply to all individuals in vicinity of the GCS.
Until engineering evaluations are complete, the provisions of paragraph 2.5. will apply to UAS
ground segments including the control element and all associated communication facilities.
   2.5.1. Electronic Devices. This section provides guidance on the use of electronic devices
   during flight operations. NOTE: Standard SUAS electronic equipment undergoes extensive
   design and testing to ensure compatibility. Almost all electronic items produce
   electromagnetic (EM) energy, thus creating potential interference with sensitive antenna-
   connected receivers. Transmitting devices produce much higher EM environments; these can
   potentially interfere with any SUAS electronic equipment (ground or air). For the purposes of
   this instruction, ―electronic devices‖ are any electronic devices not electrically interfaced
   with existing SUAS equipment.
       2.5.1.1. Authorized Portable Non-transmitting Devices.
          2.5.1.1.1. Hearing Aids.
          2.5.1.1.2. Heart Pacemakers.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                        15


           2.5.1.1.3. Electronic watches, hand-held nonprinting calculators, portable tape
           players that do not have a recording capability (such as Walkmans, etc).
           2.5.1.1.4. Electric Shavers.
           2.5.1.1.5. Equipment certified by ASC/ENAE, 2530 Loop Road West, Wright
           Patterson AFB (WPAFB) OH 45433-7101, dsn 785-8929 or 785-2860.
           2.5.1.1.6. Still photography cameras (not including digital cameras).
       2.5.1.2. Other Devices. Other devices include land mobile and tactical radios, cellular
       phones, pagers, wireless internet capable devices and similar devices. From the time the
       aircraft is readied for launch or leaves its parking spot for departure until recovered or
       parked after landing, SUAS-Os must mitigate any risks associated with Electromagnetic
       Interference (EMI) from other devices by moving required devices a sufficient distance
       so as to prevent EMI, turning the device off, or moving the Ground Control Station
       (GCS). Exception: If an EMI analysis has been completed and approval granted for the
       specific device to be used in the GCS, the above restrictions need not apply.
   2.5.2. SUAS-O Responsibility. The SUAS-O will prohibit the use of any device suspected of
   creating interference with any component of the UAS or that causes crew distraction.
2.6. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards. MAJCOMs will provide guidance on the
wearing of wigs, hairpieces, ornaments, barrettes, pins, clips, other hair fasteners, or earrings in
the SUAS ground segment, and at the launch and recovery area. Procedures must ensure
operators wearing these items do not create a FOD hazard.
2.7. Equipment Required for Flight. SUAS, designed for automatic flight, typically
incorporate self-stabilizing subsystems. All equipment necessary for automatic flight is required
for operations. Note: The minimum required displays for emergency manual recovery are:
airspeed, altitude, heading and last known position.
   2.7.1. Flight Instrumentation. Primary flight instrumentation must provide full-time display
   of attitude, altitude, and airspeed information and the capability to recognize, confirm, and
   recover from unusual attitudes. Information must be positioned and arranged in a manner
   enabling an effective crosscheck.
       2.7.1.1. The following flight instrumentation must always be displayed and illuminated
       during night operations:
           2.7.1.1.1. Climb/Dive Angle (or pitch and vertical velocity). Exception: Group 1
           UAS may use the sensor display for attitude reference.
           2.7.1.1.2. Bank Angle. Exception: Group 1 UAS may use the sensor display for
           attitude reference.
           2.7.1.1.3. Barometric Altitude.
           2.7.1.1.4. Indicated or Calibrated Airspeed.
           2.7.1.1.5. Prominent Horizon Reference. Exception: Group 1 UAS may use the
           sensor display for attitude reference.
           2.7.1.1.6. Heading.
 16                                                               AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


          2.7.1.1.7. Fault indications to include lost communication links.
       2.7.1.2. Electronic Flight Displays. Many modern instrument displays allow the SUAS-O
       to optimize GCS instrumentation for a particular mission by de-cluttering, removing or
       relocating presentations. In some cases, a SUAS-O can omit elements necessary for basic
       attitude awareness and aircraft control. Regardless of the type aircraft, mission, or
       mission phase, attitude awareness and paragraph 2.7.1 instrumentation are a full-time Air
       Force mission requirement.
2.8. Global Positioning System (GPS) Considerations (If Applicable). A GPS Notice
Advisory to NAVSTAR Users (NANU) is an advisory message to inform users of a change in
the GPS constellation. These messages are released 72 hours in advance for planned
maintenance. These messages are also used to notify users of unscheduled outages. General
NANUs can be used to disseminate general GPS information. NANUs will be checked if
intending to operate a GPS-reliant unmanned system.                     A source is:
http://celestrak.com/GPS/NANU/
   2.8.1. Operators will attempt to verify satellite availability prior to using GPS as the basis of
   flight operations. Satellites that will become unavailable during the flight should be manually
   deselected, if possible.
   2.8.2. A GPS predictive tool can be found at http://augur.ecacnav.com/. This resource
   should not be used to replace NANUs, but as a preliminary mission planning tool or in the
   event Notice Advisory to NAVSTAR Users (NANU) are unavailable in the operational area.
   2.8.3. Units will develop procedures to disseminate information about GPS reliability to
   operators in the field.
2.9. SUAS Hand-off Procedures. Detailed procedures for hand-off of airborne UAs between
ground control stations will be included in each SUAS operator’s manual or established in local
operating procedures. These are the minimum items that must be accomplished prior to launch of
the UA:
   2.9.1. Select time and location for hand-off.
   2.9.2. Select a safe recovery area for the UA.
   2.9.3. Identify a method to confirm positive transfer of control between operators, i.e., voice,
   UA maneuvering, etc.
   2.9.4. Brief all participants on the contingency plan for unsuccessful UA hand-off.
   2.9.5. Identify and confirm specific equipment settings, required at each GCS, for hand-off.

                                            Chapter 3

AIRSPACE & FREQUENCY COORDINATION PROCESS: FLIGHT PLANS AND FAA
              CERTIFICATES OF AUTHORIZATION (COA)

3.1. General. SUAS operations are conducted only in authorized airspace. SUAS operating
characteristics and systems capabilities, mission requirements, and SUAS Crew qualifications
drive specific airspace requests. Without a certified ―Sense and Avoid‖ capability, separation
from other aircraft is accomplished by mitigating measures such as segregated operating areas,
altitude blocks, or external observers. For SUAS operations in the National Airspace System
(NAS) outside of Warning and Restricted areas refer to paragraph 3.4. Operations conducted
within Restricted or Warning Areas (or within a theater of operations under combat airspace
control measures) require only coordination between responsible organizations. SUAS-Os shall
be appropriately qualified (or directly supervised by an instructor) in order to conduct operations
within the class of airspace authorized for operations.
3.2. Flight Plans. There is no file and fly provision for SUAS. This paragraph is reserved for
future development.
3.3. Airspace. Airspace managers may resolve an airspace conflict by the use of time
separation, altitude separation, lateral separation, relocation of one of the airspace users,
elimination of one of the users, or by concurrence of the approving authorities (range, airspace,
and participating units) to accept the assessed risk of simultaneous operations. SUAS-Os and
mission planners will use the procedures in paragraphs 3.4. – 3.6. to facilitate the
coordination/deconfliction process. SUAS-Os will comply with the following:
   3.3.1. FAA Documents (e.g. FAAN JO 7110.512.). Note: FAA Advisory Circular 91-57,
   Model Aircraft Operating Standards, does not apply to the operations of SUAS intended for
   military use.
   3.3.2. DOD-FAA MOAs.
   3.3.3. ICAO regulations.
   3.3.4. Host country rules, regulations, and laws.
   3.3.5. Military regulations (e.g. AFI 13-204, Functional Management of Airfield
   Operations).
   3.3.6. DoD FLIP (e.g. General Planning Guide, Area Planning Guides).
   3.3.7. Local flight regulations and procedures (e.g., Base Flying Regulations).
   3.3.8. SUAS operations manuals, checklists, and SOP.
   3.3.9. Frequency Deconfliction directives (contact MAJCOM/A6 Frequency Manager and
   Base/Range Frequency Manager).
   3.3.10. Description of operating area or a depiction, showing agreed working area
   boundaries/limits. Consider identifying a buffer zone to prevent exceeding cleared limits.
3.4. CONUS National Airspace System (NAS) Operations.
18                                                             AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


  3.4.1. Units will coordinate use of airspace within the National Airspace System (NAS)
  IAW this chapter and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) directives. SUAS operations
  may be conducted outside of restricted airspace and warning areas only with FAA
  authorization in the form of an FAA Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) or IAW
  other established FAA agreements. A DOD/FAA Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), dated
  24 Sep 07 permits Group 1 UAS operations in Class G airspace without a COA. UAS
  operations requiring a COA or operated IAW the Class G provisions of the current
  DOD/FAA MOA shall contact AFSOC/A3OU through their appropriate MAJCOM to obtain
  assistance with a COA or the Class G notification. (Exception: AFMC/A3O will process all
  COAs for AFMC RDT&E missions and units in lieu of procedures below and will forward
  info copies of approved COAs to AFSOC/A3OU.) For planning purposes, a unit submitting
  a COA should anticipate a minimum of 70 business days for processing the COA once the
  COA has been submitted to AFSOC. AFSOC requires ten business days for mission plan
  approval, COA on line account issuance, COA review, etc., and the FAA requires 60
  business days for their process. For Class G notifications, AFSOC/A3OU requires a
  minimum of three business days prior to the mission. AFSOC/A3OU will assist the
  requesting unit to ensure a NOTAM is issued NLT 24 hours prior to the Class G operation.
  Note: FAA authorization/approval of a COA is not guaranteed. Units requesting FAA
  approval to operate SUAS will follow the guidance below:
     3.4.1.1. AF units must request authorization/approval for SUAS operations outside of
     restricted airspace or warning areas through their appropriate MAJCOM POC.
     3.4.1.2. If approved, the MAJCOM will forward the request to AFSOC/A3OU via email
     to AFSOC.A3OU.WF@Hurlburt.af.mil. If the request is disapproved, the MAJCOM
     will notify the unit and provide the rationale for disapproval.
     3.4.1.3. Upon receipt of MAJCOM approval, AFSOC/A3OU will issue a COA on-line
     account to the unit (without commit authority). A COA on-line account is required for
     both COAs and for Class G notifications IAW the current DOD/FAA MOA.
     3.4.1.4. Unit requesting the COA or a Class G notification will input the information into
     the FAA COA on-line system and notify AFSOC/A3OU via email to
     AFSOC.A3OU.WF@Hurlburt.af.mil that the COA application or Class G notification
     information is complete.
     3.4.1.5. AFSOC/A3OU will review the COA application and/or Class G notification for
     accuracy to include, but not limited to:
         3.4.1.5.1. Airworthiness statement.
         3.4.1.5.2. Medical qualifications (both observers and operators).
         3.4.1.5.3. Training qualifications (both observers and operators).
         3.4.1.5.4. System and operational information.
     3.4.1.6. Once the COA application and/or Class G notification is complete,
     AFSOC/A3OU will commit the COA/Class G notification to the FAA and will notify the
     unit and the MAJCOM with the COA case number or Class G notification number.
     AFSOC/A3OU will continuously track the COA application status and will update units
     and MAJCOM as needed.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                     19


     3.4.1.7. AFSOC/A3OU will notify AF/A3O-BA of the COA details (who, what, where,
     when, etc.) and/or Class G notifications via email within 1-day of committing the COA or
     notification to the FAA.
     3.4.1.8. The FAA COA process normally takes 60 business days for new COA
     applications and 30 business days for renewals. AFSOC/A3OUI, working through
     AF/A3O-BA, will coordinate/ recommend solutions to unit based on FAA feedback,
     questions, or concerns. AF/A3O-BA will engage with the FAA to resolve any COA
     issues.
  3.4.2. Units requesting UAS operations in the NAS will coordinate with the appropriate
  frequency manager for authorization to use SUAS communication frequencies (e.g., control
  and data links, WIFI, LMR, etc.).
  3.4.3. Units must remain in communication with the specified controlling agency at all times
  during operations as well as an independent means of backup communications available from
  the ground control element to the controlling agency.
  3.4.4. If operations spill out of the assigned airspace or a Loss-of-Link (LOL) condition
  occurs and the UA does not return to the designated return home point, contact the
  controlling agency as soon as possible and provide the following information to the
  controlling agency:
     3.4.4.1. SUAS type/size.
     3.4.4.2. Last known location and time of LOL.
     3.4.4.3. Heading, altitude, airspeed.
     3.4.4.4. Estimated flight time remaining.
  3.4.5. Contact controlling agency if mission is cancelled or terminated early.
  3.4.6. Airspace restrictions for the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA defines the
  NAS as a common network of United States airspace; air navigation facilities, equipment and
  services, airports or landing areas; aeronautical charts, information and services; rules,
  regulations and procedures, technical information, and manpower and material. Included are
  system components shared jointly with the military. There are two types of airspace within
  the NAS, controlled and uncontrolled.
     3.4.6.1. Uncontrolled Airspace. The portion of airspace that air traffic control has neither
     the authority nor the responsibility for exercising control over air traffic.
     3.4.6.2. Controlled Airspace. Airspace of defined dimensions which air traffic control
     service is provided to IFR flights and to VFR flights in accordance with airspace
     classification. Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers Class A, Class B, Class C,
     Class D, and Class E airspace. Listed below is a brief description and depiction of each
     class of airspace. For more details refer to the DoD Flight Information Publication,
     General Planning (GP).
         3.4.6.2.1. Class A. Generally, that airspace from 18,000 feet MSL up to and
         including FL600, including the airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles
         of the coast of the 48 contiguous States and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized, all
         persons must operate their aircraft under IFR.
 20                                                              AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


          3.4.6.2.2. Class B. Generally, that airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL
          surrounding the nation's busiest airports in terms of IFR operations or passenger
          handling. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all
          aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace.
          3.4.6.2.3. Class C. Generally that airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the
          airport elevation surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are
          serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR operations or
          passenger handling. The airspace usually consists of a surface area with a 5 NM
          radius, and an outer circle with a 10 NM radius that extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000
          feet above the airport elevation. Each person must establish two-way radio
          communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering
          the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the airspace.
          VFR aircraft are only separated from IFR aircraft within the airspace.
          3.4.6.2.4. Class D. Generally, that airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet above the
          airport elevation surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower.
          Unless otherwise authorized, each person must establish two-way radio
          communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering
          the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace. No
          separation services are provided to VFR aircraft.
          3.4.6.2.5. Class E. Generally, if the airspace is not Class A, Class B, Class C, or
          Class D, and it is controlled airspace, it is Class E airspace. Class E airspace extends
          upward from either the surface or a designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent
          controlled airspace. Also in this class are Federal airways, airspace beginning at either
          700 or 1,200 feet AGL used to transition to/from the terminal or enroute environment,
          enroute domestic, and offshore airspace areas designated below 18,000 feet MSL.
          Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins at 14,500 MSL over the
          United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles of
          the coast of the 48 contiguous States and Alaska. Class E airspace does not include
          the airspace 18,000 MSL or above.
          3.4.6.2.6. Class G. (uncontrolled airspace). That airspace not designated as Class A,
          B, C, D, or E.

Figure 3.1. Controlled Airspace.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                          21


          3.4.6.2.7. Operations in Class D Airspace. SUAS operations in Class D
          airspace require a Certificate of Authorization (COA) or other FAA approval.
          Additional guidance in AFI 13-204, paragraph 5.8. states procedures for local SUAS
          operations must be published in the Base Airfield Operations Instruction, and any
          other appropriate Lines of Position (LOP).
          3.4.6.2.8. Restricted Area. Restricted areas contain airspace identified by an area on
          the surface of the earth within which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly
          prohibited, is subject to restrictions. Activities within these areas must be confined
          because of their nature or limitations imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a
          part of those activities or both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often
          invisible, hazards to aircraft such as artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles.
          Penetration of restricted areas without authorization from the using or controlling
          agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants.
          3.4.6.2.9. Warning Area. A warning area is airspace of defined dimensions,
          extending from three nautical miles outward from the coast of the U.S. that contains
          activity that may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The purpose of such
          warning areas is to warn nonparticipating pilots of the potential danger. A warning
          area may be located over domestic or international waters or both.
3.5. Coordination Procedures for OCONUS Host Nation Airspace. Refer to specific host
nation agreements and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and
Recommended Practices (SARPs). MAJCOMs are responsible for specifying airspace and
frequency request procedures.
3.6. Coordination Procedures for Combat Zone and other Contingency Operations. Refer
to Joint Publication 3-52, Joint Doctrine for Airspace Control in the Combat Zone, and theater
air operations directives.

      FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION, APPROVAL, AND CLEARANCE AUTHORITY

4.1. Flight Authorization. USAF SUAS flights must be authorized by the unit commander or
the first commander in the operational chain of command. Mission validity, planning, and risk
mitigation must be considered before authorization. Approving officer will initial the risk
assessment checklist (Attachment 4). Exception: AFMC will develop a tailored Operational Risk
Management (ORM) Checklist and will define the ORM program requirements for test
operations.     Note: To ensure the noncombatant status of civilians and contractors is not
jeopardized, commanders shall consult with their servicing judge advocate office for guidance
before using civilian or contractor personnel in combat operations or other missions involving
direct participation in hostilities.
   4.1.1. SUAS-O. The SUAS-O must be current and qualified in the SUAS to be operated or
   under the supervision of a SUAS-I.
4.2. Approval Authority.
   4.2.1. SUAS-Os authorized by the unit commander are the approval authority for their
   flights with the following exceptions:
       4.2.1.1. Unit commanders will approve flights for students or other non-unit SUAS-Os.
       4.2.1.2. Unit commanders will approve flights by Group 2 or higher UAS to or from
       other than established landing surfaces, such as highways, pastures, etc.
4.3. Additional Approval and Requirements.
   4.3.1. (P) Fields. MAJCOMs may prescribe which Air Force aircraft can file to or land at
   Continental United States (CONUS) civil (P) airports. MAJCOMs shall approve each airfield
   from which SUAS may operate.
4.4. ATC Clearances and Instructions.
   4.4.1. The SUAS-O will ensure compliance with ATC clearances or instructions unless:
       4.4.1.1. An amended clearance is obtained.
       4.4.1.2. An emergency exists.
       4.4.1.3. Deviation is required in response to a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance
       System (TCAS) advisory.
       4.4.1.4. Deviation is necessary to ensure safety of flight.
   4.4.2. If the SUAS-O is unsure of the ATC clearance he or she should immediately clarify it
   with ATC.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                    23


                                          Chapter 5

                               GENERAL FLIGHT RULES

5.1. Operational Standards.
   5.1.1. Reckless Flying. The SUAS-O is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is not operated
   in a careless or reckless manner that could endanger life or property. SUAS will not be used
   to conduct flights for personal use.
   5.1.2. Off-Station Training. The SUAS-O will ensure the execution of all off-station training
   activities are unit commander-approved, flown to achieve valid training requirements,
   present a positive image of the Air Force and does not present an image of waste and/or
   abuse of government resources.
   5.1.3. Unauthorized SUAS Flight Demonstrations. Unauthorized or impromptu SUAS flight
   demonstrations, maneuvers, or ―fly-bys‖ are prohibited. AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation
   in Aerial Events, addresses authorized flight demonstrations.
   5.1.4. SUAS-Os at their Stations. Operators must   occupy their assigned duty stations during
   flight operations, unless absence is normal in     the performance of crew duties, or in
   connection with physiological needs. SUAS-Os       shall not leave their duty station unless
   another qualified SUAS-O is in the ground          control station and the new SUAS-O
   acknowledges control of the aircraft.
5.2. See and Avoid. SUAS-Os operating in VMC, whether or not under radar control, are
responsible to see and avoid other traffic, terrain, obstacles and also maintain VFR cloud
clearance. For SUAS operations to comply with see and avoid requirements, they must have the
capability to see (or sense) traffic and clouds in sufficient time to perform an avoidance
maneuver in a timely manner. This can be done through the use of dedicated surface or airborne
observers (chase vehicle) in direct communication with operators. If not capable of see and
avoid, SUAS may only be operated in approved segregated airspace (Restricted or Warning
Areas, Restricted Operating Zones, etc.). In this case, VFR weather minimums may not apply.
MAJCOMs will determine SUAS weather limit requirements based on aircraft equipage, level of
autonomy and crew qualification.
   5.2.1. SUAS operations that do not comply with paragraph 5.2 will be conducted under
   specific arrangements with appropriate aviation authorities (FAA, host nation, or military
   control). FAA COAs issued IAW FAA Order (FAAO) Joint Order (J.O.) 7610.4 Chapter
   12,Section 9 or arrangements with host-nation aviation authorities do not waive the FARs nor
   provide relief from ICAO Rules of the Air. FAAO 7610.4, Chapter 12, Section 9, outlines an
   equivalent level of safety comparable to see and avoid requirements for manned aircraft.
   SUAS operations in compliance with a FAA COA are acceptable because they incorporate
   an equivalent level of safety agreed to by the FAA. SUAS operations in compliance with host
   nation aviation authorization are acceptable provided they incorporate an equivalent level of
   safety addressing as a minimum the measures outlined in FAAO J.O. 7610.4, Chapter 12,
   Section 9. SUAS operations in special use airspace are acceptable provided equivalent level
   of safety measures are in place with controlling agencies and other airspace users.
 24                                                               AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


   5.2.2. Within the NAS, ATC only provides separation between IFR and VFR aircraft
   operating within Class B and C airspace. In Class D and E airspace, ATC provides traffic
   advisories on VFR aircraft on a time-permitting basis. Standard IFR separation is provided to
   all aircraft operating under IFR in controlled airspace. Outside the NAS the crew should
   consult ICAO and country specific guidance outlined in the FCG and FLIP.
5.3. Proximity of Aircraft. The SUAS-O must not allow the aircraft to be flown so close to
another that it creates a collision hazard. Use 500 ft. of separation (well clear) as an approximate
guide except for:
   5.3.1. Authorized formation flights.
   5.3.2. Emergency situations requiring assistance from another aircraft.           Note: If an
   emergency requires visual checks of an aircraft in distress, the SUAS-O must exercise
   extreme care to ensure this action does not increase the overall hazard. The capabilities of the
   distressed aircraft and the intentions of the crews involved must be considered before
   operating near another aircraft in flight.
   5.3.3. MAJCOM-approved maneuvers in which each participant is fully aware of the nature
   of the maneuver and qualified to conduct it safely (for example, manned-unmanned
   cooperative teaming).
5.4. Formation Flight/Cooperative Teaming.
   5.4.1. Non-standard Formation Flight. Non-standard formation flights may be conducted if
   any of the following conditions are met:
       5.4.1.1. When approved by ATC.
       5.4.1.2. Operating within an authorized Altitude Reservation (ALTRV).
       5.4.1.3. Operating under the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA).
       5.4.1.4. Operating in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
   5.4.2. Transponder operations during formation flight. If equipped with IFF and unless
   otherwise specified in Allied Communications Publication 160, US Supplement 1:
       5.4.2.1. Only one aircraft (normally the lead) of a standard formation will squawk the
       assigned code.
           5.4.2.1.1. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, all aircraft within a non-standard
           formation flight will squawk the ATC-assigned Mode 3A/C beacon code until
           established within the assigned altitude block and closed to the proper en route
           interval. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, when aircraft interval exceeds 3 NMs,
           both the formation leader and the last aircraft will squawk the assigned Mode 3A/C
           beacon code.
5.5. Right-of-Way Rules. Usually, right-of-way is given to the aircraft least able to maneuver,
which normally permits that aircraft to maintain course and speed. However, visibility
permitting, each pilot must take whatever action is necessary to avoid collision, regardless of
who has the right-of-way. When another aircraft has the right-of-way, the yielding aircraft must
not pass over, under, abeam, or ahead of the other aircraft until well clear. NOTE: Due to the
size and paint scheme, a small UA may not be easily seen by other aircraft. Therefore, the SUAS
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                         25


operator must always be prepared to take evasive action to include flight termination and
potential destruction of the aircraft.
   5.5.1. Distress. Any aircraft (manned or unmanned) in distress has the right-of-way over all
   other air traffic. Manned aircraft in distress have the right-of-way over SUAS in distress.
   5.5.2. Converging. When converging at approximately the same altitude (except head-on
   orapproximately so), the aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way. Aircraft of different
   categories have the right-of-way in the following order of priority:
       5.5.2.1. Balloons.
       5.5.2.2. Gliders.
       5.5.2.3. Aircraft towing or refueling other aircraft.
       5.5.2.4. Airships.
       5.5.2.5. Rotary or fixed-wing aircraft.
   5.5.3. Approaching Head-On. If aircraft are approaching each other head-on or
   approximately so, each shall alter course to the right.
   5.5.4. Overtaking Aircraft. An overtaken aircraft has the right-of-way. The overtaking
   aircraft must alter course to the right.
   5.5.5. Landing. An aircraft established on final approach has the right-of-way over other
   aircraft on the ground or in the air, except when two or more aircraft are approaching to land.
   In this case, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way if it does not use this
   advantage to cut in front of or overtake the other.
5.6. Communication in Flight.
   5.6.1. Communication with ATC. Establish and maintain two-way radio communications
   with the proper ATC facility or FSS IAW the procedures appropriate for the class of airspace
   as outlined in FLIP. For SUAS operations in controlled airspace, two-way radio will be the
   primary means of communications. Coordinate alternate communications methods with the
   appropriate ATC facility prior to commencing operations.
   5.6.2. Emergency Frequencies. Monitor emergency frequencies at all times (unless the radio
   equipment does not have this capability).
   5.6.3. ATC Communications Failure. Follow the communications failure procedures
   published in the Flight Information Handbook (FIH). For SUAS operations there must be an
   independent means of backup communications available from the ground control element to
   the ATC agency controlling the aircraft.
5.7. Aircraft Speed.
   5.7.1. Inside the NAS. The SUAS-O will:
       5.7.1.1. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 250 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS)
       below10,000 ft. MSL unless the MAJCOM has approved a higher speed and FAA has
       granted a speed authorization.
       5.7.1.2. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS at or below 2,500 ft. AGL within
       4NMs of the primary airport of a Class C or Class D airspace area unless authorized or
 26                                                               AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


      required by ATC, or required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed
      specified in the aircraft T.O.
      5.7.1.3. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS in the airspace underlying a Class B
      airspace area designated for an airport or in a VFR corridor designated through Class B
      airspace area, unless required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed
      specified in the aircraft T.O.
   5.7.2. Outside the NAS. The SUAS-O will not allow the aircraft to exceed 250 KIAS below
   10,000 ft. MSL unless:
      5.7.2.1. Mission requirements dictate speeds in excess of 250 KIAS and operations are in
      international airspace.
      5.7.2.2. ICAO or host nation rules permit aircraft speeds over 250 KIAS.
      5.7.2.3. Necessary to maintain the minimum safe airspeed as specified in the aircraft
      T.O.
      5.7.2.4. Required by ATC and permitted by host nation rules.
   5.7.3. Holding. Conduct holding at airspeeds prescribed in FLIP or operator manual.
5.8. Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)
Systems and Procedures.
   5.8.1. Self-Contained Approaches. MAJCOMs will publish their policy and restrictions on
   the use of self-contained approaches, such as Mission Computer Approaches, in their
   supplement to this instruction.
   5.8.2. Navigation System Databases.
      5.8.2.1. Expired Database. If the database has expired, the SUAS-O:
          5.8.2.1.1. May continue a mission with an expired database, if the database
          information required for the flight can be verified with current FLIP.
          5.8.2.1.2. Shall update the database at the first opportunity.
          5.8.2.1.3. Will not fly procedures that require terminal or better accuracy (i.e.
          terminal or approach).
5.9. Airport Operations.
   5.9.1. Takeoff and Landing.
      5.9.1.1. Clearances. Obtain a clearance from ATC before taxiing, taxiing onto a runway,
      takeoff (or launch), or landing (or recovery), at an airport with an operating control
      tower.
      5.9.1.2. Uncontrolled Field Procedures. At uncontrolled fields:
          5.9.1.2.1. Use the runway favored by the winds if no other factors make that
          runwayunacceptable.
          5.9.1.2.2. Announce your activities on the appropriate frequency. (Refer to the
          Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1,Instrument
          Flight Procedures, for more detail.)
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                   27


     5.9.1.3. Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). USAF SUAS-Os are prohibited
     from accepting LAHSO landing clearances.
         5.9.1.3.1. Air Force SUAS-O may passively participate in LAHSO (land or take-off
         when another aircraft has been given a LAHSO clearance). The SUAS-O is the final
         authority whether to take-off, land or continue a touch-and-go when a merging
         aircraft has received a LAHSO clearance.
         5.9.1.3.2. MAJCOMs that require certain units or aircraft to have LAHSO
         authorization for mission accomplishment, must contact AFFSA to ensure Group-
         specific data is incorporated into FAA Order (7110.199) appendix 3.
     5.9.1.4. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). MAJCOMs may approve RSRS
     operations in a supplement to this AFI. Approval shall include RSRS criteria for each
     applicable SUAS type governing similar and dissimilar landing/touch-and-go operations.
         5.9.1.4.1. RSRS is applicable to all non-formation aircraft.
  5.9.2. Turns after Takeoff, Low Approaches, or Closed Patterns.
     5.9.2.1. Do not turn after a takeoff, touch and go or low approach until at least 400 ft.
     above the departure end of the runway (DER) elevation, at a safe airspeed, and past the
     end of the runway (if visible) unless:
         5.9.2.1.1. Specifically cleared by the controlling agency.
         5.9.2.1.2. Safety dictates otherwise.
         5.9.2.1.3. Required by local procedures.
         5.9.2.1.4. Required by the published departure procedure.
     5.9.2.2. The 400 ft. restriction does not apply when executing a closed pattern.
  5.9.3. Traffic Pattern Procedures.
     5.9.3.1. At Air Force installations, fly the traffic pattern published in the local flying
     procedures publication or FLIP, unless otherwise directed.
     5.9.3.2. At other than Air Force installations, fly traffic patterns as directed by the
     control tower or published in FLIP, FAR Part 91 Subpart B, or the AIM.
     5.9.3.3. At airports with no control tower, follow the standard light signals or visual
     indicators that prescribe the direction of traffic and landing runway. Departures must
     comply with the appropriate route for the airport. (Refer to AIM for detailed
     information.)
  5.9.4. SUAS Landing Areas. SUAS may operate from/to other than established landing areas
  (i.e., fields, highways, parks, etc.) if a military requirement exists and the user receives
  appropriate clearances (Range Operations, FAA COA, etc.). To use the area for landing,
  implement safeguards to permit operations without hazard to persons or property.
  5.9.5. Night Runway Operations. The SUAS-O will adhere to the following guidance during
  night operations from prepared surfaces:
     5.9.5.1. SUAS must not be operated from a runway or other prepared surface unless the
     takeoff and landing area is outlined with operating lights and is clearly discernible.
 28                                                              AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


       Covert runway markings may be used by qualified crews using suitable sensors or night
       vision devices.
       5.9.5.2. In Alaska, areas located north of 60° North latitude, Antarctica, and areas
               located south of 60° South latitude, aircraft may be operated at unlighted airports
       during the period of civil twilight. Use the latest version of the Air Almanac or computer
       program "LIGHT PC" to determine or calculate light and moon data.
   5.9.6. Landing Gear Reporting Procedures. SUAS-O operating retractable gear aircraft must
   report "gear down" to the ATC agency or runway supervisory unit after extending the
   landing gear. This report shall be made during any approach to an airport prior to crossing
   the runway threshold.
5.10. Altitude Requirements. Consider GCS Line of Sight (LOS) to the UA when selecting
minimum operating altitudes. If an approved FAA COA is required for operation, comply with
the provisions of the COA. If a COA is not required, except for takeoff or landing, do not operate
UAs:
   5.10.1. Emergency Landing. Below an altitude that, should an emergency landing become
   necessary, creates undue hazard to persons or property.
   5.10.2. VFR. Under VFR above 3,000 ft. AGL at altitudes or flight levels other than those
   specified in FLIP. In airspace under FAA jurisdiction, these altitudes do not apply when
   turning or holding in a holding pattern of 2 minutes or less.
   5.10.3. Congested Areas. Over congested areas (i.e., cities, towns, settlements) or groups of
   people if the altitude does not ensure at least 1,000 ft. above the highest obstacle within a
   2,000-ft. radius of the aircraft. Exception: SUAS-O operating Group 1 SUAS in the US NAS
   or operating IAW host nation agreements may operate at lower altitudes and in closer
   proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.
   5.10.4. Non-congested Areas. Over non-congested areas at an altitude of less than 500 feet
   AGL except over open water, or in special use airspace, or in sparsely populated areas. Under
   such exceptions, SUAS-O must not operate aircraft closer than 500 ft. to any non-
   participating person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. Exception: SUAS-O operating Group 1
   SUAS may operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not create a hazard to
   persons or property on the surface.
   5.10.5. Flight over National Recreation Areas and Wildlife Refuges. Mission permitting, not
   less than 2,000 ft. AGL over the following areas: national parks, monuments, seashores, lake
   shores, recreation areas, and scenic river ways administered by the National Park Service;
   national wildlife refuges, big game refuges, game ranges, and wildlife refuges administered
   by the US Fish and Wildlife Service; and wilderness and primitive areas administered by the
   US Forest Service. This paragraph is not applicable to special use airspace, low-altitude
   tactical navigation areas, and MTRs. Higher altitudes may exist for specific areas. (See
   AP/1B and sectional aeronautical charts.) Exception: SUAS-O operating Group 1 SUAS may
   operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or
   property on the surface and when prior coordination and approval has been accomplished.
   Note: Operations over these areas will typically require a COA.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                      29


5.11. Disaster Areas. SUAS-O shall not operate their aircraft within a designated disaster area.
NOTAMs list disaster areas. Exceptions are permitted when an aircraft is:
   5.11.1. Tasked to aid in airborne relief for the area.
   5.11.2. Approved to operate from an airport or operating zone in the area.
   5.11.3. On a flight that has been specifically cleared by ATC.
5.12. Altimeter Settings. When capable, set altimeters according to FLIP General Planning and
Area Planning documents. In combat zones, comply with guidance in airspace control plan and
ATO SPINS.
5.13. Simulated Instrument Flight. Reserved for future use.
5.14. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures:
   5.14.1. Restrictions. See AFI 11-5GP(1, 2, or 3)-SUAS Volume 3 for restrictions.
   5.14.2. Required MAJCOM Guidance. MAJCOMs must publish guidance for practicing
   simulated emergency takeoffs, approaches, and landings. This guidance must include, as a
   minimum:
       5.14.2.1. Procedures when a SUAS instructor or evaluator does not have immediate
       access to the aircraft controls.
       5.14.2.2. Instructions to minimize actual engine/motor shutdown when a reduction of
       power suffices.
       5.14.2.3. MAJCOMs must publish restrictions on the practice of fixed-wing simulated
       engine/motor failure or forced landing approaches under the following conditions:
           5.14.2.3.1. If the aircraft T.O.s do not furnish specific guidance for performing
           simulated engine/motor failure or forced landing approaches.
           5.14.2.3.2. Simulated engine/motor failure approaches do not conform to T.O.
           patterns.
           5.14.2.3.3. Preflight briefing does not contain simulated engine/motor failure
           procedures.
           5.14.2.3.4. Approaches are not flown at military airfields or at P-designated fields
           (where letters of agreement are in effect) that have established simulated
           engine/motor failure patterns.
           5.14.2.3.5. The airport does not have an active tower or Runway Supervisory Unit,
           enough run way for that aircraft, and proper crash equipment.
           5.14.2.3.6. The practice approaches have not been coordinated with the ATC
           agencies responsible for the airspace that the simulated engine/motor failure or forced
           landing pattern transits.
5.15. Touch-and-Go Landings.
   5.15.1. Touch-and-go landings are authorized if required by course syllabus or continuation
   training requirements.
   5.15.2. MAJCOMs may authorize touch-and-go landings in any command-operated SUAS.
 30                                                                AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


   5.15.3. MAJCOMs must provide explicit guidance in its command supplement about
   operating conditions and operator qualifications.
5.16. Dropping Objects.
   5.16.1. Restrictions. The SUAS-O will not allow the dropping of objects from the aircraft
   except:
       5.16.1.1. In an emergency.
       5.16.1.2. When mission requirements dictate.
   5.16.2. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure airdrops
   comply with applicable directives.
   5.16.3. SUAS-O Responsibilities. The SUAS-O will:
       5.16.3.1. When jettisoning fuel and circumstances permit, notify the appropriate ATC or
       flight service facility of intentions, altitude, location, and when the operation is complete.
       5.16.3.2. Drop chaff containing rope elements according to AFI 13-201, and FAA
       Handbook 7610.4, Special Military Operations.
       5.16.3.3. Report any accidental loss of equipment or aircraft parts or jettisoning of cargo
       according to AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting, and AFI 91-204, Safety
       Investigations and Reports.
5.17. Aircraft Lighting (if equipped).
   5.17.1. Reduced Lighting. MAJCOMs may authorize reduced or light-out operations in
   restricted areas, warning areas or host nation approved areas in a MAJCOM supplement to
   this instruction. Host nation approved areas may be documented in a LOA or host nation
   regulatory documentation.
   5.17.2. Aircraft Lighting During Formation Operations. MAJCOMs may authorize
   formation flights to vary their lighting configuration according to the aircraft type and
   mission requirement. The MAJCOM must ensure guidance on this type of operation is
   provided and it ensures an equivalent level of visual identification as a single aircraft.
   5.17.3. Position Lights. Aircraft equipped with position lights will display them between the
   hours of official sunset and sunrise:
       5.17.3.1. Immediately before engine start and when an engine is running. Aircraft that do
       not have power available before start shall turn them on as soon as power is available.
       5.17.3.2. When parked in an area likely to create a hazard or while being towed, unless
       clearly illuminated by an outside source.
   5.17.4. Anti-collision and Strobe Lights. Anti-collision lights and strobe lights are not the
   same. For the purposes of this section, anti-collision lights are the primary flashing light
   system on the aircraft intended to attract the attention of others to enhance see and avoid
   operations, while strobe lights are systems such as wingtip strobes or other similar strobe
   light installations.
       5.17.4.1. Ground Operations. Aircraft equipped with anti-collision lights will display
       these lights IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                     31


       5.17.4.2. Airborne Operations. Aircraft equipped with anti-collision and strobe lights
       will operate these lights as follows:
           5.17.4.2.1. Anti-collision lights must be on from takeoff to landing.
           5.17.4.2.2. Strobe lights shall be operated IAW MAJCOM or aircraft T.O. guidance.
       5.17.4.3. The SUAS-O may turn off anti-collision lights when it is in the best interest of
       safety to do so.
       5.17.4.4. The SUAS-O may continue the mission with the failure of any light of the anti-
       collision light system to the first stop where repairs can be made.
   5.17.5. Landing Lights.
       5.17.5.1. When mission requirements dictate, use of landing lights (if equipped) is
       optional during take-off/ landing, if the aircraft is equipped with an operational sensor
       that provides a visual representation of the runway environment. Operations must comply
       with paragraph 5.9.5.1.
5.18. Aerobatics. Aerobatics and air to ground tactics which involve aerobatic type
maneuvering must be performed in Restricted or Warning Areas, FAA approved COA airspace,
or host nation approved airspace. Aircraft deployed or based at overseas locations will operate
IAW applicable host nation agreements or ICAO SARPs. If the aircraft operating requirements
(altitude requirements, maximum airspeeds, dropping of objects, etc) dictated in the host nation
agreement are less restrictive than USAF/MAJCOM guidance, the most restrictive guidance shall
be used.
5.19. Participating in Aerial Events. The SUAS-O will ensure compliance with AFI 11-209,
when participating in aerial events, demonstrations, and static displays. Group/CC must approve
any flight operations.
5.20. Tobacco Use in Air Force GCS. Tobacco use is prohibited in Air Force ground control
stations. For exceptions see AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force.
5.21. Landing with Hot Armament. This paragraph is reserved for future capabilities.
5.22. Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs). SUAS-Os will immediately report hazardous weather
conditions and volcanic activity to the ARTCC, terminal ATC, or FSS. Additionally, SUAS-Os
are urged to report any significant flight condition information. SUAS-Os operating in warning
areas should forward significant weather reports to the appropriate controlling agency (e.g.,
ARTCC, military radar unit, Airborne Warning and Control System, etc). In all cases, follow
with a report to a Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) to ensure rapid dissemination to other using
agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
5.23. Operating in the Vicinity of Thunderstorms.
   5.23.1. Operations into Thunderstorms. The SUAS-O shall not intentionally operate into a
   thunderstorm except when operating on a MAJCOM-approved mission specifically requiring
   thunderstorm penetration. UAS Group-Specific AFIs will specify separation distances.
   5.23.2. Takeoff, Approach, and Landing. SUAS operators will not takeoff, land, or fly an
   approach where thunderstorms are producing hail, strong winds, gust fronts, heavy rain,
   lightning, wind shear, microbursts, or other hazardous conditions.
 32                                                                 AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


   5.23.3. Planned Route. When observed or reported thunderstorm activity adversely affects
   the planned flight route, SUAS-Os will delay the scheduled mission or alter the route of
   flight within approved airspace to avoid the thunderstorm activity. SUAS-Os shall use all
   available information including surface radar, PMSV, and PIREPs to avoid thunderstorm
   activity. Note: Induced lightning strikes and electrostatic discharges can occur in what may
   look like benign conditions; a thunderstorm does not have to be present for these discharges.
   See AFH 11-203, Volume 1, Weather for Aircrews, for detailed information on
   thunderstorms, lightning, and electrostatic discharge.
5.24. Wake Turbulence and Wind Shear. SUAS-Os of other than Group 1 UAs will:
   5.24.1. Report Wake Turbulence. Notify ATC when encountering wake turbulence on any
   approach.
   5.24.2. Report Wind Shear. Immediately report a wind shear or microburst encounter on
   takeoff, approach, or landing to the most appropriate agency (e.g., control tower, approach
   control, PMSV) and, if possible, include:
       5.24.2.1. Altitude of the encounter.
       5.24.2.2. Loss or gain in airspeed or altitude.
       5.24.2.3. Type of aircraft.
       5.24.2.4. Location of occurrence (see AFH 11-203, Volume 1).
5.25. Volcanic Activity. Air Force aircraft will not be flown in an area of known or reported
volcanic activity unless engaging in operations (such as rescue) specifically relating to the
incident. Any encounters with pyroclastic clouds (volcanic ash) should be reported as soon as
possible to the appropriate controlling agency (ARTCC, military radar unit, AWACS, etc.). In all
cases, follow with a report to a PMSV, or other applicable weather agency, to ensure rapid
dissemination to other using agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
5.26. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Operations. Crew will check NVGs prior to each use to
ensure proper operation and optimum night visual enhancement. MAJCOMs will prescribe the
use of NVGs during SUAS operations.
5.27. Takeoff with Ice or Frost. The SUAS-O will not takeoff (or launch) with ice, snow, or
frost adhering to the wings, control surfaces, propellers, engine inlets, or other critical surfaces of
the aircraft.
5.28. SUAS Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Operations. SUAS
equipped with TCAS will only operate in Traffic Alert (TA) Mode.
5.29. Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS). SUAS-Os will comply with
appropriate flight manual procedures upon receipt of a Ground Proximity Warning System
(GPWS)/Enhanced GPWS (EGPWS)/TAWS/Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS)
warning. Terrain warnings need not be followed if the pilot can verify the warning is false by
positive visual or EO/IR sensor contact with the terrain/obstacle. MAJCOMs will establish
guidance on GCAS use during tactical operations.
5.30. Imagery and Sensor Operations. When observing targets outside of government-
controlled property, comply with AFI 14-104, paragraph 9.6. ―Air Force units with weapon
system video and tactical ISR capabilities may collect imagery during formal and continuation
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                      33


training missions as long as the collected imagery is not for the purpose of obtaining information
about specific US persons or private property.‖ SUAS-Os will ensure imagery and ISR collection
assets are utilized for valid mission requirements. Regardless of Operations Area, SUAS ISR
will present a positive image/lawful purpose for the USAF and the USA. SUAS-Os and SOs will
not transfer mission collected ISR to personal devices or distribute to non-authorized sources.

                                VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR)

7.1. General Information.
     7.1.1. Air Force fixed-wing aircraft will fly under VFR when required for mission
     accomplishment. Until a certified sense-and-avoid capability is fielded, Small UAS require
     dedicated observers in order to assure separation from other aircraft and clearance from
     clouds. Normally, SUAS flights are conducted using procedural airspace control in some
     form of segregated airspace. When operating outside of Restricted Airspace and Warning
     Areas, one or more dedicated observers must be employed and the SUAS-O/Observer team
     must comply with provisions in the operable COA. The UA must remain in the approved
     airspace and VFR provisions apply:
        7.1.1.1. The SUAS-O will request and utilize VFR Radar Advisory Services (Flight
        Following) to the maximum extent possible/practical (Exception: Group 1 UAS).
     7.1.2. The SUAS-O will review the planning documents IAW paragraph 2.1. as appropriate
     to the area of operations to:
        7.1.2.1. Ensure VFR operations are authorized.
        7.1.2.2. Check for any applicable restrictions.
     7.1.3. If the weather prevents continued flight under VFR on the planned route, the SUAS-O
     will alter the route of flight, as necessary, so as to continue operations under VFR within
     approved airspace:
        7.1.3.1. To the destination.
        7.1.3.2. To land at a suitable location.
     7.1.4. SUAS must comply with provisions of FAAO J.O. 7610.4 when operating under
     VFR.
7.2. Flight Operations under VFR.
     7.2.1. National Airspace (NAS). SUAS-Os operating under VFR in the NAS shall adhere to
     the weather minimums listed in Table 7.1.
     7.2.2. Restricted Airspace. SUAS-Os operating under VFR in other than FAA airspace will:
        7.2.2.1. Adhere to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) VFR weather
        minimums listed in Table 7.2.; or
        7.2.2.2. Comply with restrictions published in FLIP or FCG.

certifications required to comply with procedures for operation under Instrument Flight Rules.
This chapter is reserved for future capabilities.

                                           Chapter 9

                          REST AND DUTY DAY LIMITATIONS

9.1. Background Information. This section prescribes rest and maximum duty periods for
operators of Air Force SUAS. Basic guidance for alertness management strategies and waiver
authority procedures are also addressed.
9.2. Waiver Authority. Procedures in this chapter may be waived when an ORM assessment
determines mission requirements justify the increased risk. Waiver authority may be delegated
no lower than group or equivalent level of command. Waiver authority is:
   9.2.1. MAJCOM/A3.
   9.2.2. Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for forces under their operational
   control.
   9.2.3. Exception: During combat operations and tactical field training exercises, group
   commanders may waive the provisions of paragraphs 9.3 and 9.4 for Group 1 UAS
   operations.
9.3. Air Force Policy.
   9.3.1. Commanders and mission planners must assess the impact of factors that reduce
   SUAS-O alertness. Specific considerations include the fatiguing effects of weather, extremes
   of temperature, nighttime operations and use of night vision imaging systems, poor sleeping
   conditions (due to both location and time of day), mission delays, and restrictive personal
   equipment.
   9.3.2. Unit commanders may recommend restricting duty time or extending rest periods to
   the MAJCOM approval authority. SUAS-Os must terminate a mission/mission leg if safety
   may be compromised by fatigue factors, regardless of authorized duty period.
9.4. Duty Day. SUAS-O duty day begins when the SUAS-O reports for duty and ends when all
SUAS associated post-flight duties are accomplished (AV/GCS teardown, RTB). The maximum
duty period (DP) for single-operator controlled SUAS is 12 hours and 14 hours for dual
controlled (e.g. SrA Smith shows for work and performs 8 hours of primary non-SUAS-O duties.
He can then perform 4 hours of single controlled SUAS-O duties.). Maximum continuous control
time will not exceed 6 hours.
9.5. Rest Period. Rest is required prior to assuming SUAS-O duties. Interruption of the rest
period for any official duty reinitiates the rest cycle.
   9.5.1. Rest is required prior to SUAS flight duties. The purpose is to ensure SUAS-Os are
   adequately rested before performing flight or flight related duties. The rest period is a non-
   duty period of 12 hours. Rest is free time which includes time for meals, transportation, and
   sleep.
   9.5.2. Interruption of rest. If the rest period is violated, it is the SUAS-O’s responsibility to
   inform his supervisor and must not perform SUAS-O duties until the rest requirement is
   satisfied. Interruption of rest includes conducting official business over the telephone.
9.6. Scheduling Limitations. Do not schedule SUAS-Os for flight duties when:
 40                                                              AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


   9.6.1. The conditions of paragraph 9.4. cannot be met.
   9.6.2. A physical condition is suspected or known to be detrimental to the safe completion of
   flight duties. SUAS-Os must report all medical/dental treatment obtained through civilian
   sources or any medical condition that hinders duty performance to the appropriate military
   medical authority. The use of medication or dietary supplements is governed by AFI 48-123,
   Medical Examinations and Standards or as approved by appropriate medical authority.
9.6.3. 3 The SUAS-O is under the influence of or using any medication or substance that
affects the ability to safely perform assigned duties. Operators may not self-medicate except
IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. SUAS operators shall not consume
alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of flight operations.
9.7. Alertness Management Strategies. Commanders, schedulers, aerospace medicine
personnel, and SUAS-Os all share responsibility for dealing with the complex issue of
cumulative fatigue.
   9.7.1. SUAS-Os must receive adequate rest to maintain optimum mental/physical
   functioning. The principle factors in determining required rest are: the duration and intensity
   of work done, quality and duration of sleep in the previous several days, the time of day
   relative to the body’s internal circadian clock, and the degree of circadian disruption (e.g.,
   shift work or jet lag).
   9.7.2. When an individual sleeps less than his/her physiologically required duration, or
   experiences poor quality sleep over successive days, fatigue develops. As little as two hours
   sleep loss can result in significant reductions in an individual’s performance. Likewise
   delaying sleep too long results in excessive fatigue and degrades performance.
   9.7.3. The failure to acquire sufficient sleep over two or more days results in cumulative
   sleep debt. Effects of cumulative sleep debt include physical and mental performance loss
   until the individual has achieved adequate sleep. For most individuals, two consecutive
   night’s sleep is needed to fully recover from a significant sleep debt. During periods of high
   operations tempo, mission planners should give particular consideration to providing SUAS
   crews regular opportunities to recover from cumulative fatigue.
   9.7.4. Skills critical to flying tend to be among the most susceptible to mental fatigue
   including monitoring tasks, embedded tasks (e.g., instructing while flying), and higher
   cognitive processes (such as problem solving in emergencies). Performance is most impaired
   during the period of the circadian trough, normally 0200 to 0600 hours. Therefore, the use of
   alertness management strategies must be considered for nighttime missions.
   9.7.5. The instructions in this chapter cannot provide a solution to all the challenges posed
   by the 24-hour demands of Air Force SUAS operations. It is essential, therefore, that
   commanders use other reasonable means to sustain SUAS-O alertness and performance.
   Consultation with aerospace medicine or other fatigue management experts is advisable.
   Examples of alertness management strategies that are currently available include tactics to
   promote effective rest and minimize pre-mission duration of wakefulness, such as extended
   rest periods, pre-positioning and sleep quarantine facilities; non-pharmacological
   countermeasures, such as bright light/physical activity breaks; pharmacological agents
   (go/no-go pills); and alertness management education and training.

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

10.1. Read Files. Review SUASMAN and Unit Read Files before all SUAS missions.
10.2. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete
until all items are accomplished. The SUAS-O operating the UA will initiate/complete all
checklists. Operator checklists will be used for all operations from preflight through post flight.
   10.2.1. Carry abbreviated checklists in checklist binders. The only pages/inserts authorized
   in checklist binders are: T.O. checklists, MAJCOM-approved checklists, briefing guides, and
   approved information guides. Units may construct locally developed SUAS flight guides.
       10.2.1.1. Make personal notes on checklists, briefing, or information guides in pencil, if
       desired. If added, all notes must be current and not in conflict with AFI and MAJCOM
       supplements.
       10.2.1.2. Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit SUAS may be lined out in
       pen.
10.3. Video/Data Capture. Each flight will be recorded using the system’s data recorder in
order to capture both telemetry and video data. This data is used for training as well as review in
the case of an incident or lost UA. Recordings may be discarded if there is no incident or mishap.
Data recordings from any reportable SUAS incident will be secured to support an investigation
to determine cause. Dispose of recordings as directed by MAJCOM Directorate of Safety. Data
from incidents involving manned aircraft or violation of ATC procedures will be reported to the
MAJCOM Safety office and AFSOC/A3OU.
10.4. Working Area. Remain within boundaries of approved airspace. Consider identifying a
buffer zone to prevent exceeding cleared limits.
   10.4.1. Within approved airspace not requiring dedicated observer(s), UA may briefly enter
   IMC if transit is required to execute the mission and:
   10.4.1.1. The applicable AFI 11-5GP(1, 2, or 3)-SUAS Volume 3 does not prohibit this.
       10.4.1.2. The transit route is confirmed free of other aircraft and the UA will remain
       within airspace boundaries.
       10.4.1.3. Weather conditions causing Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) are
       not hazardous to the UA.         Example: While operating in a Restricted Area, a Joint
       Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) is tasked to positively identify suspected enemy
       vehicles on a road on the other side of a ridge. The ridgeline is obscured by low clouds.
       There is only light rain and no significant turbulence or expectation of icing. Supporting
       helicopters are clear of the target area and fixed-wing aircraft are holding at medium
       altitude. In this case, the JTAC confirms terrain clearance altitude then commands the
       UA to overfly the ridgeline in the cloud and descend to VMC in the immediate target
       area.
10.5. Communication with external agencies. When operating in controlled airspace, SUAS-
Os must comply with the communications requirements of applicable Air Traffic Control agency
 42                                                                AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


as described in paragraph 5.6. or as defined in an approved COA. When required, maintain
contact with the range or special use airspace controlling agency. Notify the controlling agency if
the mission is cancelled or terminated early.
10.6. Observers. Within non-segregated (shared use) airspace outside of Restricted or Warning
Areas, observers must be used. Dedicated observers assist the SUAS-O in duties associated with
safe aircraft separation, terrain/obstacle clearance avoidance, and cloud clearance. Observers
must be given sufficient training and situational rehearsal on VFR and right-of-way procedures
to communicate clearly to the SUAS-O any instructions necessary to keep the UA clear of other
air traffic, terrain/obstacles, and clouds. Observer training will be specified in the unit SUAS
training program and must be approved by the unit commander.
   10.6.1. Observers must meet medical standards as prescribed in AFI 48-123 or the
   applicable FAA COA, whichever is more restrictive.
   10.6.2. Observers will possess and operationally check real-time communications link(s) to
   the SUAS-O prior to the UA entering or commencing flight operations within the observed
   airspace. Maintain continual real-time communications with the controlling SUAS-O.
   10.6.3. If the SUAS-O is unable to maintain real-time communications with the observer, the
   UA must be returned home, landed, or returned to an area that provides the SUAS-O visual
   line-of-sight to the UA.
   10.6.4. Within Restricted or Warning Areas, Operational Risk Management mitigation may
   require observers to be employed.
   10.6.5. Observer Duties. Observer(s) duties are to continuously observe assigned airspace
   sector(s) for any aircraft, balloon, or parachutist. Observer(s) will maintain continual real-
   time communications with the SUAS-O controlling aircraft operating within or transiting the
   assigned airspace. Observer(s) make timely standardized traffic reports. If traffic becomes a
   factor to the UA, the observer assesses closure rate and projected proximity and makes a
   descriptive call to the SUAS-O controlling the UA. If traffic continues to pose a collision
   hazard and the SUAS-O controlling the UA has not indicated either awareness or initiation of
   an avoidance maneuver, the observer directs an avoidance maneuver. Observer(s) advise the
   SUAS-O when reported traffic is no longer a factor.
10.7. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. SUAS-Os must be aware of and avoid wake turbulence
caused by other aircraft.
10.8. Night Operations. When operating UA in periods of darkness, in other than restricted or
warning airspace, the SUAS-O will ensure the UA is marked with overt lights. During training or
Combat/Contingency operations the lights may be overt or covert depending on the tactical need
to be visually unobserved. Group 1 UAs not equipped with lights may be modified with overt or
covert chemical light sticks or other expedient sources of marking. When operating an UA at
night with covert lights observers will be equipped with operational night vision devices.
10.9. Post Flight Requirements. Complete Operators Flight Log (See example in Attachment
3) after each flight (to include simulator flights) or as soon as possible in contingency operations.
Every operator is required to record his/her flight on a flight log that captures all the information
required for entering into SUASMAN and maintain the log until transferred to the SUAS Web
Application (e.g. SUASMAN) as soon as possible. EXCEPTION: AFMC is exempt from the
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                   43


requirement to use SUASMAN. SUAS Log And Debrief Sheet and Operators Flight Log will be
turned into the Unit SUAS-I /TM each month or per unit instructions. Exception: AFMC. Flight
logs will be used to track flight hours for each specific SUAS, which will be used to determine
currency and provide trend analysis. Exception: AFMC will develop a tailored Operators Log for
test operations.
 44                                                               AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


                                           Chapter 11

                         ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

11.1. General. Conduct of flight operations that deviate from the briefed mission for reasons of
adverse weather, low fuel/battery state, system abnormalities, or other unforeseen event are
defined as ―abnormal‖ and require specific actions.
11.2. Initial Actions. Maintain aircraft control and situational awareness. The general priority
order of ―Aviate, Navigate, Communicate‖ is the most effective method of handling abnormal
events. Well integrated crews will frequently accomplish these tasks in parallel but the priorities
remain in order. First priority must always be to maintain control of the aircraft and retain
situational awareness. Loss of the aircraft due to loss of situational awareness makes the rest of
the process irrelevant. While aviating, the crew analyzes the situation and takes the proper action
to mitigate the situation. Navigation must be the second priority. Correct analysis of the situation
leads to the decision to continue the mission, navigate to a safe area for further action, or
navigate towards a suitable recovery location while remaining clear of unauthorized airspace.
The third priority is to communicate information to appropriate agencies. UAS operations
typically require airspace control agencies to be notified of any loss of link, navigational
difficulty, or UA loss and mission control agencies to be notified of any change in mission
capability. Consider communicating with external agencies for assistance in unusual events.
However, never cease ―aviating‖ while seeking assistance or troubleshooting.
11.3. Emergency Procedures (EP). Each UAS technical order, operating handbook, or
equivalent vendor-provided publication specifies critical emergency procedures which shall be
committed to memory and acted upon without reference to a checklist. These critical emergency
procedures are distinguished from non-critical EPs by bold print (―Bold Face Emergency
Procedures‖). When encountering a system malfunction, take the time to analyze the situation
and select the appropriate emergency procedure. Always execute the appropriate bold face
procedure in the order specified. The non-flying crewmember will back up the flying
crewmember to insure correct selection and execution of the EP. The crew will execute non-
critical EPs with reference to the appropriate checklist.
11.4. Adverse Weather. Maintain situational awareness of weather conditions and trends.
Avoid turbulence that exceeds operating handbook limitations and be prepared to change
altitudes or course to mitigate turbulence and escape headwinds that may prevent recovery.
Avoid flight into precipitation that exceeds operating limitations. Be aware of icing levels and
follow operating handbook procedures for escaping or mitigating icing. Be vigilant of inflight
visibility, not only because of limitations to mission accomplishment and successful recovery but
also because of the difficulty imposed on any required observers or manned aircraft in seeing and
maintaining visual contact with the aircraft.
11.5. Impound GCS. Impound the GCS and preserve operations data for any of the following:
   11.5.1. Sustained Loss of Link resulting in automatic recovery.
   11.5.2. Uncommanded control inputs not resolved by published emergency procedures.
   11.5.3. Loss of UA control resulting in forced landing or uncontrolled flyaway.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                   45


  11.5.4. Spill out from authorized airspace. Release the GCS for operations only after data is
  preserved and the GCS is released by the investigating authority. An operations check is
  required to verify correct function before the GCS is returned to service.
 46                                                             AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012


                                          Chapter 12

                    SAFETY/OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

12.1. General. Commanders will implement an Operational Risk Management (ORM) and
mishap prevention program. Commanders will integrate ORM into SUAS mission planning and
execution at every level. ORM is a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible
courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any
given situation. ORM enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals to
maximize operational capabilities while limiting all dimensions of risk by applying a simple,
systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions both on- and off-duty. Application
of the ORM process ensures more consistent results, while ORM techniques and tools add rigor
to the traditional approach to mission accomplishment, thereby directly strengthening the Air
Force's war fighting posture. See Attachment 4 for sample risk assessment checklist.
12.2. ORM Principles. Four principles govern all actions associated with the management of
risk. These principles, continuously employed, are applicable before, during, and after all tasks
and operations.
   12.2.1. Accept no unnecessary risk. All Air Force missions and daily routines involve risk.
   The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that accomplish the mission
   while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk. Risk without a
   commensurate reward is unnecessary.
   12.2.2. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Making risk decisions at the appropriate
   level establishes accountability. Those accountable for the success or failure of the mission
   must participate in the risk decision process.
   12.2.3. Accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs. All potential benefits should be
   compared to all potential costs. The process of weighing risks against opportunities and
   benefits helps to maximize unit capability. Even high risk endeavors may be undertaken
   when there is a well founded basis to believe the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the
   costs.
   12.2.4. Integrate ORM into operations and planning at all levels. To effectively apply risk
   management, commanders must dedicate time and resources to integrate ORM principles
   into planning and operational processes. Risk assessment of operations is supportive when
   it’s done as a normal way of conducting a mission, not an add-on process performed by
   people not otherwise involved.
12.3. Authorized Uses. SUAS will be used in a safe and controlled manner and will be used for
official purposes only. The SUAS-O must conduct a thorough Operational Risk Management
assessment prior to any SUAS mission IAW Air Force Pamphlet 90-902, Operational Risk
Management Guidelines and Tools.
12.4. Human Factors. Human factor issues are of particular concern in establishing guidelines
for safe UA flight. UA flight presents human challenges different from and beyond those of
manned flight primarily because the aircraft and its operator are not collocated. As compared to
the pilot of a manned aircraft, an SUAS-O can be said to perform in relative ―sensory isolation‖
from the vehicle under his/her control.
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                           47


  12.4.1. Small UAS can present operators with long periods of low workload which
  contributes to ―vigilance-based stress.‖ Tasks associated with operating SUAS such as
  sustained visual scanning of displays requires constant attention and SUAS-Os and
  supervisors must be aware that alertness deteriorates over time.

                                          Chapter 13

                               REPORTING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. HQ AFSOC has been tasked by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to
track and report the mission capable status of all AF SUAS. Air Force units with an operational
SUAS mission will keep SUAS status updated and current in SUASMAN. OSD can generate a
mission capable status report from within SUASMAN. Timely notification of SUAS mishaps is
required in order to ensure accuracy of AF SUAS status reporting. Exception: AFMC and
USAFA need not report status for test and/or research systems.
13.2. System Reporting.
   13.2.1. Units will track each system by the manufacturers’ serial number and/or system
   number. Mission capable status will be determined by the complementary readiness of the
   following selected major subcomponents: UA, Ground Control Station (GCS), Remote Video
   Terminal (RVT) and payloads (typically electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors). The
   mission capable status will be reported IAW paragraphs 13.2.2 through 13.2.3.
   13.2.2. Terms. The following terms will be used to categorize systems, i.e., Fully Mission
   Capable (FMC), Partially Mission Capable (PMC) and Non-Mission Capable (NMC).
       13.2.2.1. FMC means every UA, GCS, RVT and payload in a system is mission capable.
       13.2.2.2. PMC means at least one UA, one GCS, and one payload is mission capable.
       13.2.2.3. NMC means either all of the UA, the GCS, or all payloads are not mission
       capable. Any one of these conditions will make the entire system NMC. Note: The
       reporting unit may subjectively downgrade system status to NMC if the system has no
       operational night payload (but an operational day payload) when a night payload is
       required for successful mission accomplishment.
   13.2.3. Status Reporting Schedule. Equipment status will be continually updated in the
   SUAS Web Application (SUASMAN). This enables higher headquarters to determine
   current equipment status.
13.3. Mishap reporting:
   13.3.1. Mishaps resulting in the loss of an aircraft, non-repairable damage or requiring depot
   level repair; injury to personnel or damage to property will be reported using the Air Force
   Safety Automated System (AFSAS) IAW AFI 91-204 and AFMAN 91-223. Mishaps that do
   not meet Class A, B, or C thresholds will be reported using AFSAS as Class E event.
   Reports are kept indefinitely in the AFSAS. The unit may maintain hard copies IAW AFI 91-
   204.
   13.3.2. Mishaps that result in minor damage that do not meet Class A, B, or C thresholds and
   that can be repaired at home station must be reported to the Unit Safety Representative who
   will determine if an AFSAS report is warranted.
   13.3.3. For the purposes of trend analysis, unintentional LOL incidents (other than brief
   incidents where link is regained and mission continued) will be reported in SUASMAN and
AFI11-502V3 26 APRIL 2012                                                                    49


  IAW AFMAN 91-223. Exception: For test operations, AFMC is exempt from the
  requirement to use SUASMAN.
  13.3.4. Incident/mishap reports will be processed IAW MAJCOM supplements to AFI 91-
  204. The names of the operators will not be released to non-USAF agencies without the
  permission of the Air Force Representative to the FAA (AFREP) coordinating the
  investigation. (Non-mishap combat losses will be reported to MAJCOMS and
  AFSOC/A3OU within 24 hours via e-mail to AFSOC.A3OU.WF@hurlburt.af.mil / SIPR:
  afsoc.UAV@afsoc.af.smil.mil or Fax: DSN 579-2026, Commercial (850) 884-2026. HQ
  AFSOC/A3OU will then forward to AFFSA and HAF/A3O-AS.)
  13.3.5. Use standard security markings and classified handling procedures for classified
  reports. Do not enter classified information into AFSAS.
  13.3.6. Refer all inquiries about SUAS mishaps to the appropriate Public Affairs (PA) office.
  13.3.7. Deployed units may relay an incident report via text message in standard line format.
