SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates the applicable directives and the organizational structure of the Office
of Small Business Programs of the Department of the Air Force by removing the
subordinate office. It also deletes paragraph 3.4 for the Historically Black Colleges and
Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) program, since the basis for this
program, 10 U.S.C. 2323, was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit on November 4, 2008. It adds the responsibility to develop policy for Air
Force Small Business Programs.

1. Mission. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), pursuant to 10 USC §§ 8013-8016,
may establish offices and officials within the Secretariat to assist the Secretary in carrying
out his or her responsibilities. As documented by Paragraph 4.1 of AFMD 1, Headquarters
Air Force, and this Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Mission Directive, the Director Small
Business Programs (SAF/SB), is established as part of the Secretariat. The SAF/SB Director
has overall responsibility for directing, managing, measuring and overseeing the execution
of the Small Business Programs for the Department of the Air Force. The Secretary of the
Air Force retains ultimate responsibility for all policies related to the Department of the Air
Force. Within his/her areas of responsibility, the Director of SAF/SB prepares policies for
SECAF approval and issues official guidance/procedures to ensure implementation of those
policies.

2. Organizational Relationships. The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for, and has
all legal authority necessary to conduct, the affairs of the Department of the Air Force. The
Secretariat, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Air Staff offices perform their
Department of the Air Force functions subject to the authority, direction and control of the
Secretary of the Air Force.

    2.1. The SAF/SB reports to the Under Secretary of the Air Force, serves as an agent of
    the Secretary of the Air Force within assigned policy and program domains and provides
    guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters pertaining to the formulation, review,
    and execution of plans, policies, programs, and budgets within his/her areas of
    responsibility. The SAF/SB is accountable to the Under Secretary for results achieved
    within the policy and program domains assigned by this Directive.

    2.2. The SAF/SB is part of the Secretariat and as such works closely with other HAF
    offices to assist the Secretary of the Air Force in carrying out his or her responsibilities.
    The SAF/SB Director and the Office of the SAF/SB work in cooperation with the
    SAF/AQ and their respective offices, as well as other HAF organizations, which are
    responsible, pursuant to Chapters 803 and 805 of Title 10 (10 USC §§ 8013-8023 and §§
    8031-8038), for assisting the Secretary of the Air Force in carrying out his or her
    responsibilities.

       2.2.1. Pursuant to Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 90-1, Headquarters Air
       Force Mission Directive – Delegations of Authority and Assignment of
       Responsibilities, two or more HAF two-letter/ digit organizations with
       responsibilities in the same functional area are encouraged to develop “standard
       operating procedures (SOPs)” that set forth procedures enabling covered
       organizations to fulfill and carry out their respective missions, roles, and
       responsibilities. There were no SoPs developed as a result of this Directive.

    2.3. There are no Field Operating Agencies that report to SAF/SB.

3. Responsibilities. The SAF/SB is specifically responsible for:

    3.1. Reporting Air Force goals, accomplishments, plans and progress for achieving the
    goals to the DoD Small Business Office for inclusion in the Small Business
    Administration’s Small Business Procurement Scorecard.

    3.2. Developing the Secretary of the Air Force’s response to Small Business
    Administration’s Secretarial Appeals.

    3.3. Consulting with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to carry out the duties and
    responsibilities described by this directive.

4. Delegations of Authority/Assignment of Responsibility: Attachment 1 lists delegated
authorities and assigned responsibilities to the SAF/SB. The authorities
delegated/responsibilities assigned to the SAF/SB by this HAF Mission Directive may
generally be re-delegated unless re-delegation is expressly prohibited by the attached
delegation or superseding law, regulation, or DoD issuance. While the SAF/SB may re-
delegate authorities to other Department of Air Force officials, he or she will ultimately be
responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force for all matters affecting the Air Force Small
Business Programs. Any re-delegation of authority/assigned of responsibilities made shall
not be effective unless it is in writing. Any person re-delegating authority in accordance
with this HAF Mission Directive may further restrict or condition the authority being re-
delegated.

5. Notifications to Congress: No re-delegation of authority/assigned responsibility under
this HAF Mission Directive below the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary or three-
letter/digit office shall include authority to provide notifications or reports to Congress.

6. Revocation of Secretary of the Air Force Order: No additional Secretary of the Air
Force Orders have been revoked.
