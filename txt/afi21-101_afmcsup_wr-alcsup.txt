                      MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.8. (WR_ALC) Waiver Request. Send waiver requests or proposals to change this
supplement to WR-ALC/QP for WR-ALC Commander (WR-ALC/CC) approval. The Quality
Assurance/Environmental Office (WR-ALC/QP) will forward approved requests for action. Unit
requests for waiver must contain justification as to why the unit cannot comply with the existing
guidance, actions taken to achieve compliance, and expected date of compliance. Test or trial
programs that deviate from instructions are not authorized without prior approval from WR-
ALC/CC. All waiver requests, to include tests and trials, require notification to AFGE Local
987, prior to implementation.
1.9.1. (WR_ALC) Operating Instructions (OIs). WR-ALC/QP will be the office of primary
responsibility (OPR) for applicable maintenance policy guidance, consolidation, and
coordination. WR-ALC/QP will review all Complex OIs and group-level OIs to ensure the
instructions are technically accurate, complete, and consistent with AF and Major Command
(MAJCOM) policy. OIs will be reviewed biennially.
1.13. (WR_ALC) Communications. The WR-ALC Control Center (WR-ALC/OBLD) is
responsible for developing the communications plan for WR-ALC/CC and Maintenance Group
(MXG) CCs/Civilian Leaders (CLs). The communications plan (WR-ALC OI 33-106, Personal
Wireless Communication Systems Management) covers radios and all other forms of wireless
communication (cell phone, BlackBerry type device, etc.). This WR-ALC OI meets all the
requirements of AFI 33-106, Managing High Frequency Radios, Personal Wireless
Communication Systems, and the Military Affiliate Radio System.

number; loading the TK (with a line item for the keys) into FEMS; and preparation of a TK-
CRL, in addition to any other process designated by HHQ guidance. Quality checks will be
performed by master tool crib to ensure the inventory matches the TK-CRL and the CTKs are in
compliance with the current instructions/regulations. The master tool crib will notify the group
OPR (satellite tool crib, product support center [PSC], tool/equipment monitor, resource control
center [RCC] supervisor) when the TK is ready for delivery. The master tool crib is accountable
for the TK and its contents until delivered to the group OPR. If there are backordered tools,
ensure those kits are filled with priority when the tools are received from the vendor. Provide a
report to the groups upon request, showing which kits have backordered tools and the status of
those tools.

lost tool reports, issue receipts, backorder receipts, or any other paperwork that changes the
quantity, description, or number of pieces for an item in the kit.
10.3.4.4. (Added) One drawer of a CTK (if empty) may be used to store consumable items.
This drawer must be marked “Consumables.” Consumable items will be identified on the
supplemental list and will be shadowed. Consumable items will meet the same inventory
requirements as all other items contained in the TK or supplemental box/drawer.
10.3.4.5. (Added) When requested, supplemental top boxes will be provided by 402 MXSG
for these items (including consumables, personal protective equipment [PPE], or personal items)
not issued with the TK. When top box is requested, the user is responsible for securing the top
box using a government-supplied lock.
10.3.4.6. (Added) All WR-ALC TKs will be identified externally with one-half inch or larger
lettering with the individual’s name or satellite tool crib the TK is assigned to, Robins AFB GA,
and TK ID number.

shadowed layout, or silhouette as to make the tool/item readily identifiable.
10.3.6.3.1.1. (Added) Consumables are considered products that are used in the process or on
the aircraft or end item. These are items used in conjunction with tooling or equipment yet, after
limited usage, do not maintain their original configuration and are considered used up. Examples
are safety wire, solder, tape, string, chalk, etc.
10.3.6.3.1.2. (Added) Consumable items (for the purpose of this instruction) will not include
any items issued through the Hazardous Distribution Support Center, which are items such as
super glue, sealant, fiberglass kits, resins, etc. These items are not authorized to be stored in any
part of the TK.
10.3.6.3.1.3. (Added) Contaminated consumable items will be properly disposed of in the
appropriate initial accumulation points. Contaminated consumables will not be stored in TKs.
10.3.6.3.2.1. (Added) For the purposes of this instruction, expendable items are considered
tool items that become unfit for use and must be periodically replaced. Examples include items
such as blades, apexes, drill bits, and reamers. Expendable items are issued/exchanged by 402
MXSG or the group PSC/satellite tool crib and must be added to the supplemental list if not on
the TK-CRL.
10.3.6.3.2.2. (Added) Expendable items stored in the TK will be listed on the TK-CRL or
supplemental listing and shall only be replaced on a one-for-one basis. If an expendable item is
broken, as many pieces as possible will be recovered and the tool will be turned in for
replacement to the tool issue center. If an expendable item is broken and all pieces cannot be
recovered, the supervisor will be notified as soon as possible to determine if lost tool procedures
apply. Every reasonable effort should be made to collect all parts of a broken expendable item.
10.3.6.3.2.3. (Added) Group/squadron tool issue centers are authorized to purchase, stock, and
issue expendable items with WR-ALC tool control manager authorization.
10.3.6.5.1.1. (Added) If a tool is turned in for replacement, the tool attendant will provide the
individual with evidence of nonissue (402 MXSG computer-generated receipt or AF Form 1297,

turned in for calibration when required. The AF Form 1297 or computer-generated receipt will
be kept in the TK until the equipment is returned. If space permits, the AF Form 1297 or receipt
may be kept in a plastic bag stored in the foam cut-out of the tool for ease in identifying and
locating it.
10.3.6.5.1.3. (Added) A hand receipt (AFMC Form 310, Lost/Found Item Report) for lost tools
or other authorized form of documentation is required to verify the reason the tool is missing
from the TK. This documentation will be kept with the TK-CRL.
10.3.6.8. (Added) The master TK-CRL (original) will be maintained at the master tool crib.
10.3.6.8.1. (Added) A copy of the TK-CRL will remain with the TK at all times and will be
suitably protected (plastic bag, etc.) so the list will remain legible.
10.3.6.8.2. (Added) For all PSC-issued tools and equipment, a copy of the TK-CRL will be
maintained by the PSC/satellite tool crib supervisor. The master tool crib maintains the TK-CRL
for all master tool crib-issued TKs.
10.3.6.8.3. (Added) All copies of the TK-CRL must reflect the same information.
10.3.6.9. (Added) The supplemental list will be signed and dated by the individual responsible
for the TK and his/her supervisor. Any item added or deleted will be initialed and dated by the
individual and supervisor. The supplemental list will be kept in the TK.

safety glasses) maintained for other purposes, such as visitors, tours, general shop/lab use, will
be marked by owning organization.
10.3.16. (Added) Closing inspection. A two-person certification will be accomplished prior to
installing any panel, door, or access cover on WR-ALC-supported aircraft, engines, or major end
items. This inspection will verify no foreign objects (FOs), tools, rags, or other obvious defects
are present in or around the immediate vicinity (2-foot radius of the panel, door, or cover) at time
of closure. The closing inspection will also verify accountability of tools, technical data,
equipment, rags, and consumables used in the closure area. The closing inspection will look for
evidence of grossly improper installation of equipment (tubing, electrical connectors, etc.) and
securing devices (clamps, safety wire, cotter pins, washer locking tabs, etc.). Special emphasis
will be placed on using correct hardware (fastener size, type, grip length, etc.) to secure panels,
doors, and access covers to the extent the inspection team is qualified to assess these items.
When documenting panel, door, or access cover installation in the applicable maintenance record
AFTO Form 781A or AFMC Form 173, MDS/Project Operation Assignment, the individual that
stamps the production certifier block of the AFMC Form 173 or signs the inspected by block of
the AFTO Form 781A verifies the closing inspection was completed. Immediately close and
secure all inspected panels, doors, and covers after completing the closing inspection. If any of
these items are disturbed after the closing inspection is completed (rework), another closing
inspection will be required.
10.4.1.2.3.1. (Added) AFMC Form 62, CTK Inventory and Control Log, is also authorized.
10.4.2.2.1.1.1. (Added) All procedures followed by PSCs apply to satellite tool cribs and tool

who accomplished the inventory, findings discovered, and recommended corrective actions,
which will be answered, in writing, by the PSC supervisor. The reports will be submitted to the
TCM within 30 working days.
10.4.2.2.1.2.1.1. (Added) All users of a CTK are responsible for the following:
10.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. (Added) Single User. At the beginning of the shift, the user will sign/check
out the key and perform a visual inspection of the TK. At the end of the shift, he/she will
perform a tool inventory of the TK and document on page 1 of the AFMC Form 309. He/she
will then sign/check in the key to the secure lockable storage device.
10.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. (Added) Multiple Users. At the beginning of the shift, the supervisor or
designated individual must sign/check out the key and perform a visual inspection of the TK. At
the end of the shift, the supervisor or designated alternate will perform a tool inventory of the TK
and document inventory on page 1 of the AFMC Form 309. He/she will sign/check in key to the
secure lockable storage device. AFMC Form 62 will be used when tools are removed/returned.
AFMC Form 62 waivers may be requested from the WR-ALC tool control manager.
10.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.3. (Added) If a TK is used by multiple shifts, an AFMC Form 309 will be
maintained with the TK for each shift. The shift will be written across the top of each AFMC
Form 309 (i.e., “DAY SHIFT,” “SWING SHIFT,” or “OWL SHIFT”).
10.4.2.2.1.3. (Added) Individual Responsibilities. Any person, regardless of position, in
possession of tools controlled and issued by 402 MXSG will ensure that:
10.4.2.2.1.3.1. (Added) The original configuration and layout of the TK is not changed or
altered unless approved in advance by the group/squadron tool/equipment monitor except as
authorized in paragraph 10.3.4.2
10.4.2.2.1.3.2. (Added) Tools issued in the TK are not modified in any way except for regular
care and maintenance (such as smoothing out nicks, polishing, or removing burrs). Any
substantive modifications or changes require justification for change documentation signed by
the supervisor and tool/equipment monitor and approved by the appropriate engineering
authority. Drawings will be kept on record within the group engineering flight.
10.4.2.2.1.3.3. (Added) The TK is properly locked and tools are secured when not in use
unless it can be seen by the responsible party IAW paragraph 10.7.1.2.2.
10.4.2.2.1.3.4. (Added) All tools are accounted for when moving from one job location to
another or when one task is completed prior to starting another task. This is a visual inventory to
ensure all tools are accounted for before continuing. Each group will define an auditable process
to ensure all tools are accounted for before continuing.
10.4.2.2.1.3.5. (Added) All TK-related documentation is suitably protected (plastic bag, etc.).
10.4.2.2.1.3.6. (Added) If a tool is broken, as many pieces as possible are recovered and the
tool is turned in for replacement to the tool issue center. If a tool is broken and all pieces cannot
be recovered, the supervisor will be notified as soon as possible to determine if lost tool
procedures apply. The tool issue center must ensure every reasonable effort was made to collect
all parts of a broken tool. This includes drill bits, apex bits, and other expendable tools.
10.4.2.2.1.3.7. (Added) Replacement and backorder tools should be picked up within 5
working days of notification. Notification will be by phone, e-mail, or a letter posted at the tool
issue center.
10.4.2.2.1.3.8. (Added) The supervisor is notified if a tool/item is lost or cannot otherwise be
accounted for.
10.4.2.2.1.3.9. (Added) Chemicals, hardware, components, or material (aircraft bits and
pieces) are not stored in the TK.
10.4.2.2.1.3.10. (Added) PME and TMDE are turned in for calibration when required, and
temporary and special loan tools are turned in when required.
10.4.2.2.1.3.11. (Added) Tools are returned to the appropriate tool crib or tool issue center to
be replaced when the TK ID number can no longer be easily read. Obtain a receipt for any tools
that are turned in.
10.4.2.2.1.3.12. (Added) A replacement copy of the TK-CRL is requested when it becomes
hard to read, illegible, lost, or damaged. When a replacement TK-CRL is required, the
individual will notify the tool/equipment monitor and supervisor, who will request a copy of the
TK-CRL by TK ID number from 402 MXSG. When a replacement TK-CRL is required, 402
MXSG will maintain the original and copies will be provided to the appropriate PSC/satellite
tool crib.
10.4.2.2.1.3.13. (Added) A visual inventory is conducted when a new TK-CRL is requested.
Inventory must be accomplished by both the PSC/satellite tool crib supervisor or a representative
designated in writing, and the person responsible for the TK.

whether local or deployed, follow standard tool control procedures contained in AFI 21-101 and
all supplements.
10.5.4.1. (Added) TMDE will not normally be laser-etched, because the laser-etching and
removal process may impair the performance of the equipment. Currently, there are pieces of
TMDE that have already been laser-etched. TMDE, when found during TK inspections, will not
be identified as deficient findings.
10.5.4.2. (Added) All tools or equipment that can be marked (except for those identified on the
expendable, consumable, non-disposable PPE, and non-marked list) will be marked with a tool
ID number. The TK-CRL will be marked “Y” to indicate the tools are marked and “N” to
indicate they are not marked. Items with an asterisk are not required to be marked.
10.5.7.2.1. (Added) Tool control manager designates PSC numbering methodology and
configuration. PSC are numbered according to group/squadron ownership and location.
10.5.7.2.2. (Added) PME and TMDE shall be afforded the same controls as other tools. If the
laser-etching process deteriorates the accuracy of the tool, the tool will not be laser-etched. If it
is determined the tool can be laser-etched without deteriorating the accuracy of the tool, then
laser-etching is permitted. PME may be etched with PMEL-designated tracking numbers.
10.6.2. (Added) In some cases, locally manufactured/modified tools may be issued to an
individual on a permanent basis. The supervisor and tool/equipment monitor are the approving
authorities for permanent issuance of such tool. Permanently issued items will be identified on
the supplemental list and will be shadowed. Both the tool/equipment monitor and supervisor
will initial in the “Add” column and date the supplemental list to show proper authorization.
FEMS will be annotated with “PERMANENT ISSUE” or, when FEMS is unavailable, an AF
Form 1297 will be annotated and maintained on file (for accountability and inventory) until the
item is returned.
10.7.1.2.2. (Added) Dispatchable tools, equipment, and TKs are considered attended and/or
secure if the item can be seen by the user. Upon mutual agreement, verbal delegation of user
responsibilities is authorized. In other words, one employee may ask another employee to watch
over his tools for a short time (such as, but not limited to, a rest room break, phone call, or tool
run) so long as the other employee agrees to do so.
10.7.2.11.1. (Added) The AFMC Form 311, Certificate of Responsibility for Government
Property, will be maintained by the supervisor.

following as a minimum:
10.7.4.1.3.1. (Added) Verification that all tools have the correct tool ID number, that the
number is legible, and that there is only one number on each tool. Some TMDE items may have
both a tool ID number and a PMEL tracking number.
10.7.4.1.3.2. (Added) Verification that tools are in serviceable condition. If tools are found to
be unserviceable, they will be replaced prior to issue.
10.7.4.1.4. (Added) The PSC, satellite tool crib, or tool issue center attendant and the
individual receiving the tool/equipment shall conduct an inspection of all tools and equipment at
the time of issue and at the time of return. Calibration and inspection dates shall also be verified
as current for time of the loan.
10.7.4.1.5. (Added) Broken tools/equipment shall not be disposed of by the user. They must
be returned to the PSC, satellite tool crib, or tool issue center for replacement.
10.7.4.2.1.1. (Added) Tools and equipment must be returned to the PSC for re-issue upon
expiration of the 30-day loan unless installed on aircraft. Tools/equipment installed on aircraft
must be verified by the supervisor/representative that they are still installed on the aircraft before
renewal.
10.7.5.2.1. (Added) Point of Use (POU) stations will have a unique number assigned by PSC.
POU stations will only issue tools, expendables, and equipment on a one-for-one basis. POU
stations containing consumables, expendables, or equipment will be managed by the PSC. POU
stations containing tools/equipment will be the responsibility of the satellite tool crib and/or the
RCC supervisor at the POU stations is location.
10.7.5.2.2. (Added) Consumables may be stored and issued individually or in a consumable kit
from a POU station application. If issued as a kit, a supplemental listing must accompany the
kit.Note: Any item requiring one-for-one accountability will not be allowed in a POU station
application within the area of a functional test flight, engine test cell, and fuel cell.
10.7.5.2.3. (Added) Each POU station that contains tools/equipment must be secured. They
will only allow those personnel authorized the ability to access.
10.7.5.2.4. (Added) The POU station database must, at a minimum, capture the nomenclature,
minimum/maximum levels, and quantity on hand for each item contained in the application. The
database must also allow the user to capture any required inspections.
10.7.5.2.5. (Added) Each bin location within an application must be labeled, as a minimum,
with the nomenclature.
10.8.1.4.1. (Added) The supervisor will direct an extensive search of the area using all
available personnel; this may include group quality and safety personnel, if necessary.
Additionally, the supervisor will notify his/her supervisor. If the tool/item is found, it will be
returned it to the individual with no further action. Immediate reporting of lost or missing items
is encouraged to increase chance for recovery or discovery.
10.8.1.5.1. (Added) If a lost tool/item is reported within the regulatory guidelines of Chapter
10 of this instruction, the employee reporting the lost tool/item is not necessarily deemed
negligent. Negligence will be determined through an investigation and the completion of AFMC
Form 310. (Reference AFI 21-101, paragraphs 10.4 through 10.4.3.5, for tool accountability
requirements.)
10.8.1.5.1.1. (Added) Military and civilian personnel may suffer pecuniary liability for the
loss, damage, or destruction of government property issued to them when caused by their
negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use. Prior to initiation of any
collection action resulting from a liability determination, all timely filed appeals or grievances
for relief shall be exhausted and the timelines for filing elapsed unless the employee declines, in
writing, to seek relief. The terms damage and destruction do not include wear and tear resulting
from normal use. This applies to all tools, initial issue, temporary, or special loan, or equipment
issued by the 402 MXSG tool issue centers or a PSC.
10.8.1.5.1.2. (Added) When a tool/item is lost, the PSC/tool issue center or supervisor will
determine if a Report of Survey (ROS) must be initiated (see AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey
for Air Force Property). If the ROS officer determines negligence or theft is involved, the
individual(s) may be charged for replacement as follows:
10.8.1.5.1.2.1. (Added) Non-repairable Tools. Non-repairable tools (i.e., screwdrivers,
hammers, pliers, wrenches, etc.) are considered fully serviceable to the point of loss or theft.
The replacement cost will be the normal source of supply (e.g., General Services Administration
or Defense Logistics Agency cost).
10.8.1.5.1.2.2. (Added) Repairable Tools. Tools that can be disassembled and have their
internal parts repaired or replaced, (i.e., drill motors, air wrenches, impact wrenches, etc.) will be
depreciated IAW AFI 51-501, Tort Claims, and/or AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident
Investigations. The replacement cost will be the normal source of supply cost. If serviceability
of a tool is in question, the supervisor will consult the group/squadron tool monitor for a
determination.
10.8.1.5.1.2.3. (Added) Tools will not be removed from service due to minor surface rust or
corrosion. Only if the degradation progresses to the point that it impedes the functionality or
proper use of the tool can the tool be identified for removal and replacement. Tools with nicks,
cuts, or other imperfections are serviceable unless the imperfection hinders the proper use of the
tool or represents a safety hazard. To identify a tool for removal from service, the supervisor
will coordinate with the squadron/group tool monitor for authorization/approval. The supervisor
is required to ensure all tools are serviceable when conducting the 90-day inspection of all CTKs
and individual took kits (ITKs). In addition, the supervisor can refer to TO 32-1-101 for the
proper guidance on usage and maintaining tools.
10.8.1.5.2. (Added) CTK lost-tool procedures will be handled the same as ITK procedures,
with the following exception. If a tool/item is lost from a CTK with multiple users during a shift
and it is unknown who lost the tool/item, the name of the individual responsible for the TK at the
time the tool/item was reported missing will be entered in block 2 on the AFMC Form 310.
Block 9 will have the legible signature. If continuation is needed, use back of AFMC Form 310.
10.8.1.8.2. (Added) Immediately upon realization of a lost tool/item, the individual will
conduct a 15-minute search of the surrounding area and equipment for the lost tool/item. If the
individual performed maintenance on an aircraft, the individual must ensure the aircraft is also
searched. If the tool/item is found, the individual will return it to its original location and no
further actions are required. If the tool/item is not found within 1 hour, the supervisor will
contact the MOCC for a control number and initiate an AFMC Form 310. Only one tool/item
will be identified on an AFMC Form 310 report.
10.8.1.8.3. (Added) The MOCC will assign control numbers and maintain the lost tool/item
control number log. The first letter of the control number will identify the group (A - AMXG, C
- CMXG, E - EMXG, M - MXSG, and S - SMXG), followed by the two-digit fiscal year, a dash,
and a three-digit control number. Example: A07-001.
10.8.1.8.4. (Added) Supervisor Responsibilities:
10.8.1.8.4.1. (Added) Complete AFMC Form 310 through section 16.

Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher.
10.8.1.8.4.3. (Added) The supervisor will ensure the forms are legible and include the
necessary details to provide an accurate description and location of the tool/item that is lost along
with details relative to the search to ensure all efforts were made to locate the lost tool/item. The
supervisor will contact his/her tool monitor for coordination.
10.8.1.8.4.4. (Added) Forward the AFMC Form 310 to the applicable flight chief for
coordination within 1 business day. A copy of the AFMC Form 310 will be provided to the
individual to be stored in his/her TK until the tool/item is found or replaced.
10.8.1.8.4.5. (Added) If the tool/item is found at a later date, the supervisor reporting the lost
tool/item will complete an AFMC Form 310 up to block 10 and mark “YES” in block 16
indicating that the tool/item was found and contact MOCC for the original control number. The
new AFMC Form 310 will be processed in the same manner as the original. The supervisor will
give the AFMC Form 310 to the appropriate tool monitor, who will give a copy to the supervisor
and mechanic and maintain a copy for a minimum of 2 years.
10.8.1.8.4.6. (Added) If a lost tool/item is believed to be on an aircraft that has taxied or taken
off, the supervisor will notify MOCC, and MOCC will alert the 339 FTS to contact the aircraft
and recall it.
10.8.1.8.4.7. (Added) If tool/item is lost on a piece of equipment, all work will cease and the
supervisor will ensure a search is conducted. If the piece of equipment requires impounding, the
supervisor will follow procedures defined in Chapter 9, Section 9B, of this instruction. If
impounded by the impoundment authority, the impounded asset will be cordoned off and tagged
with a copy of the AFMC Form 310. The word “IMPOUNDED” will be written in bold red
letters across the AFMC Form 310. This form will remain on the asset until the supervisor
receives notification from the tool/equipment monitor that the original AFMC Form 310 has
been signed for release by the impound release authority.
10.8.1.8.5. (Added) Flight Chief Responsibilities:
10.8.1.8.5.1. (Added) Review and sign AFMC Form 310 in block 17 (a) and forward to the

           TECHNICAL DATA AND WORK CONTROL DOCUMENT (WCD)

19.1.1.1.1. (Added) Extracts of other forms of technical data will be controlled the same as
engineering drawings. (Reference: WR-ALC OI 63-101, Maintenance, Distribution, and
Control of Production Engineering Drawings).
19.1.1.1.2. (Added) WR-ALC TO Extract Policy. Only unclassified TO extracts may be
printed from authorized sources. Any individual, with appropriate ID and password, can print a
TO extract from any computer. The individual who prints a TO extract from a Web site, local
server, or compact disk/digital video disk is responsible for ensuring its currency. All TO
extracts shall include the TO title page with the distribution markings, date printed, and initials.
Printed TO extracts are valid for a maximum of 30 calendar days. TO extracts needed more than
30 days must be checked for currency monthly by the user until destroyed. Document the date of
the monthly currency on the title page along with the reviewer’s initials.
19.1.1.1.3. (Added) The TO extract may be placed in recycle or regular trash receptacles as a
whole document if marked “Unlimited Distribution” on the title page. However, if the TO has a
distribution limitation statement, it may be recycled by placing different parts of the extract in
different recycle bins, torn into three or more pieces or shredded and placed in one bin, or
incinerated. Proprietary data must always be shredded before recycling.
19.1.1.5.1. (Added) WR-ALC/QPQ is the designated WCD focal point for WR-ALC. As the
OPR for WCD programs, QPQ assists all groups with WCD program requirements.
19.2.2.1. (Added) The program manager/system program office engineer will determine the
disposition of contractor’s technical data after contracts ends.
19.2.6.1. (WR_ALC) WCDs shall be auditable to the level that will determine what task was
accomplished; who accomplished the task, and date the task was accomplished. The unplanned
WCD will contain the course of corrective action and technical data. When requested on the
WCD, document part number and, where applicable, serial number of serialized parts/assemblies
replaced. For maintenance work requests (MWRs), this information can be documented in the
corrective action block. If the technical data that is referenced on the task requires 100-percent
replacement of parts/assemblies, it is not necessary to annotate this information.
19.2.6.1.1. (Added-402d Electronics Maintenance Group [402 EMXG] and 402 CMXG
only) Repair WCDs shall be auditable to the level that will enable the determination of what
tasks were accomplished, by whom, and the date accomplished. Specific maintenance actions,
as well as any serialized parts/assemblies replaced, may be documented in Logistics Data
Management System (LDMS). If LDMS is used for the maintenance record, the WCD will
have a task/informational note which will be stamped by the mechanic. This action will verify
that actions and parts documented in LDMS are accurate. The technician, upon verifying the
accuracy of LDMS data, will then perform the closing action in LDMS that will prevent the
editing or altering of the maintenance record. In the event that LDMS is temporarily not
available, the technician will make an informational note in the task description block listing
maintenance actions taken and serialized parts replaced. The technician will stamp and date
beside this entry. In the event that the loss of LDMS becomes permanent, planning may format
WCDs in such a way as to give the technician a place for entry and certification of maintenance
actions taken and serialized parts replaced.
19.2.6.2.1. (Added) Aircraft WCD reviews will be considered accomplished during the LRDP,
including the Engineering Requirements Review.
19.2.6.2.2. (Added) Exchangeable workload management of items subject to repair. A
comprehensive WCD review will be accomplished during the performance of the required labor
standard reviews. WCD reviews will be documented with an AFMC Form 500, Work Control
Document Production Planning Team Checklist. See AFMCI 21-105, Depot Maintenance Work
Measurement, WR-ALC Supplement for additional instruction.
19.2.6.3.1. (Added) The reference designation on WCDs is not required. When WCDs are not
marked “REF,” not-IAW tasks are understood to be the same as previously notated “REF” tasks.
19.2.6.5. (Added) When it is not practical to have the WCD attached to the end item
throughout the repair process, there must be a designated location in each shop for the
WCD/work package to be kept. The WCD must be kept where it is readily available to the
mechanic(s) performing the task. The mechanic is not required to be in possession of the WCD,
but must be able to locate it when asked.
19.2.6.6. (Added) The Program Depot Maintenance Schedule System (PDMSS) WCD
generated by Role Oriented Consolidated Information Tool is the equivalent of the AFMC Form
173.
19.2.7.1.1. (WR_ALC) Control Change Manager (CCM) is a WR-ALC approved alternate
method of tracking WCD changes. The person identifying the need for a change on the WCD
will submit the request to planning by initiating a CCM ticket. The initiator is responsible for
including all required names on the CCM ticket. The initiator is responsible for including WCD
numbers and request in the item summary field and the reason for the request in the justification
field. When changes to a RCC are required, both the old RCC and new RCC supervisors will be
required to enter an approval or decline statement in the comment block of the CCM ticket. It is
the responsibility of the gaining supervisor to submit tickets for RCC changes. The ticket will be
created on behalf of the losing supervisor. The responsible planner/industrial engineering
technician (IET) will complete the requested actions within 15 working days. The planner/IET
shall enter a statement in the CCM ticket comment block indicating the request was accepted or
explain why the request was not accomplished. Maintain CCM ticket electronically or in
planning jacket for a minimum of 2 years.
19.2.9.1.1. (Added) For those meetings involving critical tasks/operations identified on WCDs,
it is mandatory that a quality assurance specialist (QAS) attend. The appropriate planning office
that chairs this meeting will ensure there is a sign-in sheet of all attendees and meeting minutes
and a list of attendees is sent out to all attendees/parties.
19.2.10.1.1. (Added-402 AMXG only) WR-ALC Form 29 is used for workloads processed
through 402 AMXG squadrons only. The WR-ALC Form 29 will not be used in other WR-ALC
groups. The WR-ALC Form 29 will be kept in a designated location most practical for the
aircraft environment. Each WR-ALC Form 29 will have an approved AFMC Form 173 for time
accounting attached.
19.2.10.1.2. (Added-402 AMXG only) The WR-ALC Form 29 defects will be input into the
MWR system for data collection, production effectiveness, and accounting purposes. The
statement “For time accounting purposes only” or equivalent will be added to the task
description block of the AFMC Form 173, and an X inspection code will be assigned.
19.2.10.1.3. (Added) A copy of the WR-ALC Form 29 and instruction sheet is located at the
402 AMXG intranet site. Blocks 1 through 8 are mandatory/required entries, block 9 only for
over and above operations, blocks 10 through 29 are mandatory/required entries, and blocks 30
and 31 only if applicable.
19.2.10.3.1.1. (Added-402 CMXG only) Handscribed AFMC Form 173 and AFMC Form
959, Work Control Document, are authorized during work emergencies due to system outages.
Use instructions from AFI 21-101, AFMC Supplement 1, Table A14.5, for handscribed AFMC
Form 173; and AFMC 21-101, AFMC Supplement 1, Table A14.4 for AFMC Form 959. The
scheduler will maintain control of the certified handscribed AFMC 173/AFMC 959 at
completion of the task which will be turned in to the record’s section. When systems are
operational, the responsible 402 CMXG planner will input the write-ups in the MWR system for
data collection, production effectiveness, and accounting purposes. The statement “for time
accounting purposes only or equivalent” will be added to the task description block of the AFMC
Form 173 and an X inspection code will be assigned.
19.2.10.3.1.2. (Added-402 AMXG only) Handscribed AFMC Form 173 and WR-ALC Form
29 are authorized during work emergencies due to system outages. The planner will approve the
task by applying their IET stamp in the appropriate IET stamp block. The scheduler and
production supervisor approve the WCD for work. The aircraft logistics specialist (ALS) will
maintain control of the certified handscribed AFMC Form 173/WR-ALC Form 29 at completion
of the task which will be turned in to the record’s section. When systems are operational, the
ALS will input the write-ups in the MWR system for data collection, production effectiveness,
and accounting purposes. The statement “for time accounting purposes only or equivalent” will
be added to the task description block of the AFMC Form 173 and an X inspection code will be
assigned.
19.2.14.1.2.1.1. (Added) If a technical data change updates any planned specification or
tolerance contained on a WCD, the planner will have a formal PPT review using an AFMC Form
500 for documentation purposes. The AFMC Form 500 will be kept in the labor planning jacket
or AFMC Form 500 planner file as it applies. The planner will ensure the WCD is updated
within 15 working days after formal posting of the TO change.
19.2.14.1.2.2.1. (Added) The appropriate planning organization shall ensure the planner
maintains a control log of all WCDs containing specifications and tolerances. The log may be in
an electronic format or manually maintained. At a minimum, this log will identify the WCD
control number, date of last PPT review, technical data number, basic date, change date, and
change number.
19.2.15.1. (Added)      As required, the mechanic/technician can manually record
measurements/notes taken during maintenance processes within the WCD task description block.
The mechanic/technician must not make changes to any of the wording in the task description
block nor to any of the control data (i.e., skill code, RCC, Inventory Tracking System [ITS]
codes, inspection codes, etc.). The planner can also provide a generic data collection/note sheet
for miscellaneous annotations that will be attached to the WCD.
19.2.15.2. (Added) Product realization requires validation of and recordkeeping for
maintenance tasks identified as customer key characteristics (CKCs). Evidence of conformance
on CKCs is mandated under the Quality Management System (reference RAFB Manual
[RAFBMAN] 63-501, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center Quality Management System, and
WR-ALC OI 63-501. CKCs are defined by the customer, i.e., the system program office (SPO),
in terms of specific process or product requirements (e.g., temperature, time, humidity, physical
dimensions, serialized tracking, torque setting value, lab measurements). Whenever a CKC is
measured, the unique identifier of the measuring device shall also be recorded (e.g., torque
wrench, PMEL ID # F198637). WCDs shall incorporate all identified CKCs. Partnership
workloads are governed by the implementation agreements. Mechanics shall capture data for
those CKCs listed on the WCDs. To facilitate data collection, the planner can include space for
capturing this information on the WCD or provide for annotations on a data collection/note sheet
that is readily identifiable to and attached to the WCD. Any questions regarding whether
specific process or product requirements have been designated as CKCs shall be referred to the
cognizant SPO for resolution and final disposition.
19.2.16.6.1. (Added) Multi-task, Sub-task, and Team-task Certification. The following
procedures will be followed to document work accomplished for critical team tasks that are
accomplished by several individuals and for all work accomplished by more than one person due
to shift change:
19.2.16.6.1.1. (Added) For any critical team task, a definitized guide will be created that
provides a place for each mechanic to certify indicating that his/her portion of the WCD is
complied with.
19.2.16.6.1.2. (Added) When a mechanic cannot finish a task/operation due to shift change,
the mechanic will turn the WCD over and document all maintenance performed up to that point,
stamp, and date the entry. When space is not available to make an entry on the WCD, the
mechanic will physically attach a handscribed data sheet with the entry traceable back to the
WCD header information and task/operation. The mechanic that continues the task/operation
will use the information from the entry to determine where to start when the task/operation
resumes. When the task/operation is completed, the mechanic completing the task will stamp
and date the WCD.
19.2.16.7.2.1. (Added) For AFMC Form 173 workbook, the QAS manually adding a Q code
will write a prominent and conspicuous Q next to the inspection code (i.e., MQ, EQ, IQ) in the
header of the AFMC Form 173 workbook and stamp and date above or just below the added Q;
also write a Q in the top left corner of the quality certifier block. The QAS that completes the
verification/inspection will stamp and date just below the large X that appears in the quality
certifier block.
19.2.16.7.2.2. (Added) For the ITS workbook, the QAS manually adding a Q code requirement
will draw or stamp a box for the Q code stamp to the right of the production certifier’s block.
Then the QAS will stamp and date the entry outside the added box. The QAS that completes the
verification/inspection will stamp and date inside the added red stamp box. The QAS Q code
addition stamp and verification/inspection Q stamp are two separate entries.
19.2.16.7.3.1. (Added) All manual changes and additions to in-process WCDs will be made by
the planner/IET, with the exception of inspection code upgrade/downgrade. Changes in the
verbiage of the task description and to technical data will be made in red ink. Any changes by
the planner will be “IET” stamped and dated. The production controller (scheduler) may make
changes to the end item serial number and job order number (JON). Serial number and JON
entries performed by the scheduler will be made in ink and will be “C” stamped and dated. All
changes or additions will be entered in ink and, if not specifically restricted, may be made in blue
or black ink.
19.2.17.1. (Added) Handwritten task operations will not be added to WCDs.
19.2.19. (WR_ALC) Aircraft/exchangeables rework shall be accomplished using rework
WCDs developed for that purpose. Labor hours shall be charged to duty code .26.14 (indirect
labor for miscellaneous defective asset rework) in the timekeeping system.
19.2.19.3.1. (Added) For non-tracked ITS documents (used for AFMC Form 206, Temporary
Work Request, workload and definitized guides in 402 CMXG/402 EMXG), the below
procedures will apply:
19.2.19.3.1.1. (Added) The planner will print a new non-tracked ITS document, which will be
a duplicate of the original document. The new rework WCD will include all of the operations of
the original.
19.2.19.3.1.2. (Added) The operations on the new rework WCD before the first step requiring
re-accomplishment and those after the last step requiring re-accomplishment will be crossed out
using a blue or black-ink diagonal line placed from the upper left to the lower right of these
operations. No stamping or annotating of these operations is required.
19.2.19.3.1.3. (Added) This process may be repeated as necessary throughout the repair or
manufacture of the end item.
19.3.5.1.1. (Added) Certify completion of task is defined as the work is complete, meets the
requirements of the source technical data, and is stamped and dated by a certified
technician/mechanic as soon as possible. Efficiently stamping of the WCD ensures auditability.
19.3.5.4.1. (Added) Any time a maintenance stamp is used, it must also be dated. The stamp
and date combination is considered one entry; if one is in error, for any reason, the void process
applies to both, and both have to be reentered, if needed. If one entry (e.g., date) is made
incorrectly before the second entry (e.g., stamp) is made, the void process may be applied
without the second entry being present. Then re-enter date and stamp, if required.
19.3.5.9. (Added) Upon completion of unpredictable discrepancies, document a description of
corrective action and include technical data reference in the corrective action block. Stamp and
date applicable block(s).
19.3.6.5.1. (Added) During the course of repair of an end item, it may become necessary to
change the serial number of the end item on the WCD.(Added) Note: For those items routed
from aircraft for repair, the end item serial number is not the aircraft tail number. The
production controller (scheduler) can make this change. The change to the serial number must
be made in ink. The scheduler must C stamp and date this change. The C stamp and date must
be in blue or black ink. In some cases, the WCD may be released to the shop floor without the
serial number annotated. Once the end item serial number is determined, the production
controller (scheduler) must annotate the serial number on the WCD. This annotation must also
be in ink and C stamped and dated in blue or black ink. Annotation of a part number/serial
number on an AFMC Form 173 will be done by the technician in blue or black ink.
19.6. (Added-402 AMXG work only) Planned Operations Workbook G097/PDMSS. The
workbook lists all required planned operations that will be worked on an aircraft. This workbook
may also be printed as a computer version of an AFMC Form 173 if the system capabilities exist
in G097/PDMSS. If this version is used, the workbook then becomes the official record of
maintenance performed on the aircraft, and the workbook entries will be considered official
WCDs.
19.7. (Added) Unpredictable Operations Workbook G097/PDMSS. This workbook is used
in conjunction with the system-generated AFMC Forms 173 for documenting actions taken upon
discovery of a defect for which there is no planned operation. This workbook is used to
document all unplanned maintenance required to comply with programmed depot maintenance
requirements. This workbook may be printed as a computer version of an AFMC Form 173 if
the system capabilities exist in G097/PDMSS. If this version is used, the workbook then
becomes the official record of maintenance performed on the aircraft and the workbook entries
will be considered official WCDs. If used, this workbook must contain all the required blocks
(the computer version does not have to be identical to the AFMC Form 173 as long as all of the
mandatory/required information is documented) listed in AFI 21-101, AFMC Supplement 1,
Table A14.5. for an AFMC Form 173, and the following Reliability and Maintainability
Information System (REMIS) requirements:

TITLE CONTENT

Corrective Action                Upon completion of unpredictable discrepancies, mechanic
                                 documented a description of corrective action and technical data
                                 reference for all maintenance actions.
Actual Hours                     Mechanic annotated actual hours spent on the operation.
Action Code                      Maintenance performed to clear the discrepancy; e.g., remove
                                 and replace, P remove, Q reinstall, etc.
19.8. (Added) Unpredictable Discrepancy Log. This log is for documenting the input and
processing of unpredictable work actions within WR-ALC. These logs are used for the
identification of unplanned work to be accomplished. The discrepancy log will be completed to
ensure they are auditable/traceable at all times. The production support section (PSS) will
provide an unpredictable log for defect documentation. The initiator will enter a detailed
description auditable to the discrepancy into the log. The discrepancy should include: damage
type (crack, broken, delaminated, tear, etc.), approximate size of damage, and location of the
damaged area (zone\station, top, bottom, fwd, aft, etc.) for the discrepancy. The production
supervisor must document the inspection code and check the critical or noncritical block on the
discrepancy log. If the production supervisor is not fully familiar with the work, a qualified
work leader or journeyman technician/mechanic documents the inspection code and checks the
critical or noncritical block on the discrepancy log. The person annotating the inspection code
and deciding if the task is either critical or noncritical must stamp and date in the production
certifier block. The PSS will input the discrepancy into the MWR G097 (PDMSS). These
discrepancy logs will be located at the aircraft while the aircraft is in work or in a designated area
in the back shops. This workbook will be turned in to the records section with the WCDs at the
completion of each aircraft. Storage requirements for unpredictable discrepancy logs in the back
shops will be to archive in a planner/scheduler file. The unpredictable discrepancy log is
available in the WR-ALC Forms site as WR-ALC Form 12, Unpredictable Discrepancy Log
                                         Chapter 20

(i.e., 402 AMXG OI 21-127, Engine Management, or 402 CMXG OI 21-6, Comprehensive
Engine Management for FJ2067 SRAN Account). No other group or office within WR-ALC is
authorized to input data into the CEMS or to assume EMRs. Whenever it is necessary for 402
AMXG or 402 CMXG to involve another WR-ALC organization that does not have EMRs,
EMRs will continue to be handled by the group requesting involvement (i.e., 402 AMXG or 402
CMXG). Whenever an engine (or component) is transferred between 402 AMXG and 402
CMXG, the group with custody of an engine (or component) will carry out EMRs pursuant to its
respective OI until the physical pass-off occurs, at which time the group accepting custody of the
engine (or component) will take over EMRs pursuant to its respective OI until subsequent
transfer of custody to another organization with documented EMRs.
