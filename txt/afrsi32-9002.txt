SUMMARY OF CHANGES

All references to Corps of Engineers (COE) have changed to United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE). References to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National
Guard (ANG) have been removed from this publication. The Recruiting Groups (RCGs) review
of Recruiting Squadrons (RCSs) not located on military installations is no longer required. The
process for Recruiting Facilities Program (RFP) has changed so actions can be input into the
Rental Facility Management Information System (RFMIS) at any time of the year. References to
Recruiting Facilities Existing Program have changed to the Recruiting Facilities Lease Support
Program. Recruiting Facilities Maintenance Program is divided into Recruiting Facilities
Maintenance and Repair Program, and Mission Support Program to reflect changes in RFMIS.
Furthermore, minor facility problems will be followed up by the unit POC until issues are
resolved, eliminating the 30-day follow-up suspense file. Inspection of recruiting facilities will
now be conducted by logistics personnel or squadron POC knowledgeable of the facility
standard requirements, vice the unit commander or support flight commander. Recruiting units
will no longer maintain a complete case history file of facility records; these are now available
online in RFMIS. However, they will maintain limited file of key documents. HQ
AFRS/RSXLR will manage the facility identification process. HQ AFRS/RSXLR and unit
POCs will now monitor the status of their real estate actions during the program fiscal year (FY)
through RFMIS.

Section A— Terms

1. Annual RFP. Annual RFP is the annual consolidation of recruiting facility actions for all
services along with required actions created by USACE. The program includes all planned
actions for a particular FY, and is the sole means for budgeting the real estate costs for opening
new offices, expanding, relocating, upgrading, or closing existing offices.
2. Collocated Facility. Collocated facilities are recruiting offices or squadron headquarters
activities occupying space acquired under a single lease or other document which also provides
space for recruiting activities of one or more of the other armed services. Such facilities may be:
   2.1. Adjacent or adjoining with separate entrances.
 4                                                        AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012

main stations (squadron and HP headquarters) for all military services.
4. Executive Agent. USACE acts as the executive real estate agent on behalf of all the
recruiting commands for the military services.
5. Facility Actions:
     5.1. Closure - terminating a recruiting office or squadron headquarters in a locality when a
     requirement no longer exists for any such facility in that area.
     5.2. Expansion - providing additional space for an organization at its existing location.
     5.3. New Office - acquiring space to support a new organization or requirement established
     to service a locality, city, or area of a city where no office now exists.
     5.4. Reduction - reducing the real estate cost of a space by reducing the square footage or
     renegotiating the terms of the lease agreement.
     5.5. Relocation - moving an organization to a different location within the same area of
     responsibility.
     5.6. Renewal - negotiation of a succeeding agreement allowing the continued use of a
     location.
     5.7. Upgrade - improving, by one or more methods, the space currently housing an
     organization.
6. General Purpose Space. Space that may be suitable for use by government agencies
interchangeably, except for space in buildings located on Department of Defense (DoD)
installations. Squadron headquarters facilities not located on a DoD installation are identified as
General Purpose Space.
7. Joint Recruiting Facilities Committee (JRFC). Comprised of headquarters personnel from
each military service, representatives from USACE, and JRFC Chairman, as assigned by the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD). The JRFC formulates recruiting facility
policy, reviews and approves actions with significant cost impacts and serves as a focal point in
resolving disagreements between local recruiting commands.
8. Part-time Office (PTO). Space used by a recruiter at a location other than his or her
assigned office. PTOs have no authorized manpower positions assigned.
9. Recruiting Operational Facility. A real property facility that supports or is required to
support an AF recruiting activity. This term includes facilities for squadron headquarters, HP
recruiting offices, flight chiefs, Air Force Recruiting Offices (AFRO), and PTOs. It does not
AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                    5


include facilities to support any AF recruiting organizational element above squadron level or
any AF activities or personnel associated with Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS).
10. Rental Facilities Management Information System (RFMIS). Database system used by
OASD, military services, and USACE to program, approve, and monitor the execution of
required recruiting facility actions. RFMIS is also used to maintain facility inspection data, lease
and space assignment information, such as square footage and annual cost data. RFMIS is
considered the official source of RFP information.
11. Space Assignment Record. Document used by General Services Administration (GSA) to
show a specified space has been assigned to designate governmental agencies in buildings or
areas where GSA has space assignment authority.
12. Special Purpose Space. A GSA space classification, which describes space that generally
represents a unique requirement that is specific to fulfilling the needs of a particular agency and
would not normally be suitable to meeting the needs of most other federal agencies. Recruiting
offices are designated as special purpose space.

Section B—Responsibilities for Real Property

13. Commanders. Commanders with operational control of recruiting facilities will ensure unit
POCs:
   13.1. Maintain up-to-date, accurate facility inspection, facility address, and telephone
   number data in RFMIS for all facilities under their control.
   13.2. Input annual RFP actions consistent with recent facility inspections.
   13.3. Request a relocation action only when the current location does not meet minimum

   recruiting commands.
   13.5. In conjunction with approved new office and relocation actions, provide USACE with
   reasonable and justifiable delineated boundaries where the AFRO could be located. When
   existing DoD recruiting offices are located within the defined area, every effort should be
   made to collocate with the other services at that site.
   13.6. Evaluate in a fair and reasonable manner all potential sites that appear to meet DoD
   standards as defined in the DoD RFP, Consolidated Policies and Procedures Guide when
   relocating an office or establishing a new office. Reject space only when one or more of the
   exceptions in paragraph 26 of this instruction exist.
   13.7. Obtain commander’s or support flight commander’s signature on proposed floor or site
   plans provided by USACE within five workdays, and ensure that the amount of space is
   within DoD standards as defined in the Consolidated Policies and Procedures Guide.
   Logistics personnel may sign the proposed floor plans when the commander and support
   flight commander are not available and brief the commander immediately upon his/her
   return.

Section C—Space Acquisition Process and Standards

19. Acquisition Standards. The Consolidated Policies and Procedures Guide provides
information on general policy, quality standards, and space standards that apply to AF recruiting
facilities as well as the facilities of the other armed services. Logistics personnel should be
familiar with the content and application of the Consolidated Policies and Procedures Guide.
AF recruiting space standards may not differ from DoD standards. Proposed supplements to this
instruction that address space standards may not contradict the DoD standard.
20. Space Acquisition Process for Recruiting Offices. For new offices and relocations, an
approved process exists to evaluate potential sites and select from a defined geographic area the
best overall site in terms of cost and mission effectiveness. This process is required by the
Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), 41 USC 251. USACE must fully involve each military
service in the site evaluation process for all relocations and new offices. NOTE: Any failure by
USACE to use the approved rating process should be reported to HQ AFRS/RSXLR
immediately.
   20.1. Unit POC will input into RFMIS a proposed delineated area with well-defined
   boundaries such as streets, roads, rivers or other landmarks that represents the
   acceptable/non-acceptable areas to relocate or establish the new office. On a multi-service
   relocation, the overlap in the delineated areas between all of the services represents the area
   that USACE will look for and solicit offers for space. Delineated areas must be large enough
   for USACE to obtain adequate competition on the solicitation. In some cases, USACE may
   ask that the size of a delineated area be increased in order to meet CICA requirements.
 8                                                        AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012


        20.1.1. Current and out year, add-on new office and relocation actions, as well as those
        actions added after the collocation meetings, except for upgrade actions, will require the
        unit to provide USACE a proposed delineated area.
        20.1.2. Failure to provide the required proposed delineated area will result in moving to a
        new or relocated office site without AF input to the new site’s location. However, the
        service will be allowed to participate in the site rating evaluation as well as the floor plan
        approval process.
     20.2. Participate in a site survey after USACE finds minimally acceptable sites within the
     delineated area. USACE will provide a site rating form to each service at the site survey
     (units should provide a representative familiar with the standard criteria to attend). Use the
     form to evaluate each site against the standard criteria.
        20.2.1. Avoid rating sites against one another. Rate them against the standard. The AF
        representative must enter their site evaluation rating into RFMIS according to the RFMIS
        timeline after the USACE realty specialist has loaded the site rating ID. If the unit fails
        to input a rating, USACE will notify HQ AFRS/RSXLR who then inputs a rating based
        on how the other services rated the sites.
        20.2.2. Site rating information provided by all of the services is combined with lease cost
        information for each site and, based on a JRFC-approved formula, the lease is awarded to
        the highest scoring site.
        20.2.3. After the site survey, USACE must provide a floor plan to the services. Floor
        plans should include wall-to-wall measurements, window, door and column
        measurements (if any) and locations, and placement of outlets and phone jacks.
        20.2.4. When approving floor plans ensure that the space provided allows the minimum
        space authorized by the DoD standard outlined in the Consolidated Policies and
        Procedures Guide. Units will have five working days to approve or propose changes to
        the floor plan. If the unit fails to respond, USACE must notify HQ AFRS/RSXLR who
        then has five working days to provide a response. Failure by the service to respond will
        negate inputs regarding the floor plan layout. Floor plans will be signed by the
        commander, support flight commander, or in their absence, the logistics specialist.
21. Air Force Part-time Office Approval Guidance. HQ AFRS/RSXLR and OASD will only
approve maintaining a PTO in a locality when it meets the established criteria. When a PTO is
collocated with full-time offices of other services in retail space programmed for relocation, the
PTO should close when the other services relocate. Unit POCs will submit requests with
justification for a new PTO to HQ AFRS/RSXLR for approval.
     21.1. Leased PTOs are authorized to provide a limited AF presence in remote, sparsely
     populated areas at least 50 miles away from the nearest full-time AFRO. PTOs will be used
     a minimum of 2 days per week, and leased only when suitable rent-free space cannot be
     located. The potential for recruits in the area must be great enough to justify the cost of
     acquiring and maintaining the space.
     21.2. The continuing requirement for PTOs must be evaluated 120 days prior to the end of
     lease term. The justification will include the following:
        21.2.1. The distance of the PTO from the full-time office to which it is attached.
AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                     9


       21.2.2. The percent of the total market and production of the full-time office served by or
       obtained from the PTO.
       21.2.3. The hours per week the PTO is used.
   21.3. All PTOs are carried in RFMIS as “active” offices and must be closed whenever
   possible.

Section D—Annual Recruiting Facilities Program (RFP)

22. Key Components of the RFP. The RFP consists of five key components: maintenance and
repair, reduction, mission support, lease support programs and special program support.
   22.1. It is critical that program actions be input into RFMIS. Actions can be input into
   RFMIS for out-years at any time. Recruiting units must not add actions to the current fiscal
   year without prior approval from HQ AFRS/RSXLR after the current year program has been
   approved/stamped. The program stamp date is a floating date determined by JRFC
   Chairman. When the date is announced, HQ AFRS/RSXLR will notify the unit POCs via e-
   mail.
   22.2. The JRFC meets periodically to determine total facility program funding levels,
   identify special funded actions (for example, squadron relocations), and discuss collocated
   relocations that are priorities for more than one service. Service headquarters will finalize
   the prioritized program by the stamp date, as determined by the JRFC chairman. This final
   list becomes the USACE approved program. After the approved program is established, any
   additions are considered add-on actions. These additions generally receive a lower funding
   priority, and USACE may not be able to accomplish the action during the program FY.
   Current year funded and obligated, yet not completed, actions will be accomplished in the
   following FY. Current year unfunded, unobligated, and not yet completed actions will not
   roll over to the next FY, but will need to re-compete during the prioritization process.
   Recruiting unit POCs will receive training and guidance on this process.
23. Recruiting Facilities Maintenance and Repair, and Mission Support Programs. These
programs represent the local recruiting command's portion of the total recruiting facility budget,
and they are used for mission-related facility actions. The Maintenance and Repair Program
consists of upgrades to improve facility appearance and improve the recruiter work environment
and quality of life. Examples of Mission Support Program actions include relocating
unsatisfactory offices, expanding offices to provide room for additional personnel and opening
new offices.
   23.1. As program actions are input into RFMIS, the system will provide instant cost
   estimates that will allow local commands to monitor the estimated cost of their actions.
   23.2. HQ AFRS/RSXLR will make necessary adjustments to the program based on unit
   actions that are entered into RFMIS. The unit POC will use priority code 777 for high
   priority actions and numbers one, two, three, etc., through the last action to indicate what
   action is to be accomplished first, second, third, and so on, as determined by the unit
   commander. High priority actions should be limited to 10% of the unit’s program.
   23.3. JRFC approval is required for relocations, expansions and new offices. These actions
   affect the other services and have a significant impact on the total annual cost of the facilities
 10                                                      AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012


   program. All local commands must load justification documents which explain why the
   requested action is needed from a mission-related perspective into RFMIS.
   23.4. Maintain all AFROs in accordance with the DoD standards found in the Consolidated
   Policies and Procedures Guide. Follow the annual facility inspection process in paragraph
   31 of this instruction. Major upgrades for offices (such as, replacing carpet, repainting, etc.)
   should be planned for and programmed well in advance. (As a general rule of thumb, carpet
   should not be replaced more than once every 5 years, and repainting should not be required
   more than once every 3 years.) Because of the time and effort spent by USACE to obtain
   bids, upgrades should be programmed in the same FY as the lease is to be renewed. This
   allows USACE to save program dollars by negotiating the lease renewal and the upgrades at
   the same time.
   23.5. Minor upgrades are improvements estimated at $2,500 or less. Local commands may
   request a minor upgrade at a particular office at any time during the year through HQ
   AFRS/RSXLR prior to inputting the action in RFMIS. Common examples of minor
   upgrades include steam-cleaning carpet, touching up paint, replacing a few ceiling tiles, or
   repairing holes in walls.
24. Recruiting Facilities Reduction Program (RFRP). Input and update of RFMIS
information in the RFP is shared between the USACE and recruiting commands. Potential
reduction program actions include space reductions and expansions to reallocate the space
between two or more of the services, and office closures. In collocated offices, it is often not
possible for a single service to close an office (doing so typically leaves excess and unusable
space). Most recruiting office leases do not allow for terminating only a portion of the space.
Unit POCs should immediately notify HQ AFRS/RSXLR of any proposal to close an office.
Refer to paragraph 30 for space occupancy and release procedures.
25. Recruiting Facilities Lease Support Program. USACE controls this program.
Components of the Lease Support Program include lease renewals, emergency upgrades, and
unplanned relocations.
   25.1. Unplanned relocations are situations where the services have no choice but to move;
   this could be due to deteriorating conditions resulting from acts of nature. Examples include,
   but are not limited to flooding, hurricanes, fires, tornados, etc.; also, a lessor’s refusal to
   renew the lease or perform needed repairs.
   25.2. Emergency upgrades are defined as actions that must be taken immediately to preserve
   and protect the health and safety of persons at the office, and the security of the property
   itself. Report actions of this nature telephonically to USACE, then follow up with a written
   request as soon as possible.
26. Rejection of Proposed Sites/Floor Plans:
   26.1. Commanders should use sound judgment before rejecting a proposed site or floor plan.
   In general, reject sites or floor plans only when one or more of the following conditions exist:
       26.1.1. The site is not within the delineated area specified.
       26.1.2. The space is within a building that prohibits effective recruitment. (Address
       specific problems.)
       26.1.3. The space is within a rundown or unsafe building.
AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                   11


       26.1.4. Insufficient space is available for effective recruitment. Compromising some
       space requirements is inevitable because the exact amount required is seldom available.
       As a general rule, an offer of space containing less than that authorized may be rejected.
       26.1.5. The space is impossible to arrange or subdivide to afford integrity and provide
       privacy to the AF.
       26.1.6. There are no provisions for installing ceiling-high partitions around the test area.
       26.1.7. Because of the dimensions, any floor plan developed that would require
       occupancy of a main office area too narrow to permit effective use.
       26.1.8. Lack of access to the office at night, on weekends, and on holidays.
       26.1.9. The local command was not invited to participate in the site survey.
   26.2. Do not reject a space offer for any of the following reasons:
       26.2.1. Solely on the basis that it is collocated.
       26.2.2. Friction could develop between the recruiters of the various armed services.
       26.2.3. The facility offered is no better than the one currently occupied.
       26.2.4. The AF would be located in the rear office of the collocated facility. Of prime
       importance is assurance that the method used to determine office location within the
       facility is fair and equitable. USACE is required by DoD policy to use a random process
       to assign space.

Section E—Recruiting Facility Management

27. Janitorial and Utilities Services:
   27.1. USACE provides janitorial and utilities support to all the armed services recruiting
   facilities. If services and support are not performed in accordance with the terms of a lease,
   procurement document, or a space assignment record, local commands should notify
   USACE. Document continuous problems on the janitorial checklist, and forward the
   checklist to the USACE District. Notify HQ AFRS/RSXLR of unresolved or ongoing
   service and support issues.
   27.2. Some leases for commercial space do not include provisions for furnishing lighting,
   heating, air-conditioning, etc., except during normal duty hours (40 to 50 hours a week).
   Local commands will arrange directly with USACE to obtain adequate utility and services
   support. USACE is responsible to contract for all costs involved for overtime services it
   authorizes.
28. Minor Facility Problems:
   28.1. Report either telephonically or via e-mail to USACE, facility problems that do not fall
   into the minor or emergency upgrade category that are handled by, or are lessor
   responsibilities, outside of the RFP. USACE, as the lease holder, is the only entity
   authorized to communicate with the lessor or lessor’s representative. Examples might
   include minor ceiling leaks, burned out light bulbs, or heating and air conditioning problems.
   Follow-up is the unit POC’s responsibility until the issue is resolved. If the issue is not
   resolved in a timely manner, elevate to HQ AFRS/RSXLR.
 12                                                        AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012


29. Vehicle Parking:
   29.1. USACE provides parking spaces for assigned government motor vehicles (GMV)
   based on the number of assigned vehicles in RFMIS. USACE is not responsible for
   providing parking space for privately owned vehicles (POV); however, availability of
   adequate POV parking should be a prime consideration in evaluating sites for potential office
   locations.
   29.2. Local commands should validate RFMIS vehicle numbers once a year during facility
   inspections, particularly for unit headquarters, and report any discrepancies to HQ
   AFRS/RSXLR.
   29.3. Leased parking at a PTO is not authorized. PTOs do not have personnel permanently
   assigned to them; therefore, PTOs are not authorized GMV parking.
   29.4. Unless otherwise specified by USACE, recruiter POVs should be parked in employee
   parking areas at recruiting offices (i.e., at the rear or side of the building or in perimeter lots).
   Recruiter GMVs and POVs must not occupy space required for applicants, visitors, and other
   tenants of the building or shopping center.
30. Space Occupancy and Release Procedures:
   30.1. When new space is obtained through a relocation, new office or expansion action, do
   not occupy the space until you are authorized to do so by USACE.
   30.2. When an office closure is proposed, units will not vacate the space until directed by
   HQ AFRS/RSXLR or until an approved AFRS Form 1399 authorizing the office closure is
   received by the unit. Units should coordinate the turn-in of office keys, parking passes, etc.,
   with USACE.
   30.3. Immediately refer any problems with regard to occupying or vacating space to HQ
   AFRS/RSXLR.
31. Inspection of Recruiting Facilities:
   31.1. To ensure facilities are maintained according to the DoD standards, inspect each
   recruiting facility (to include PTOs, flight chief offices, and squadron headquarters) at least
   once a year and enter the rating in RFMIS not later than 10 days after the inspection. NOTE:
   New offices must also be inspected and the rating entered in RFMIS not later than 30 days
   after the acceptance of the new office.
   31.2. The unit POC, or if unavailable, the flight chief for facility’s AOR familiar with the
   process will inspect each new or relocated facility before occupancy, and any failures to meet
   the DoD standards as contained in the Consolidated Policies and Procedures Guide should
   be brought to the attention of USACE for correction. Document any deficiencies and the
   proposed timeframe for corrective actions, for example, missing exterior recruiting signs.
   31.3. Document all facility inspections within 10 days on the facility inspection screen in
   RFMIS. Attachment 2 provides criteria for completing the facility inspection screen in
   RFMIS. Based on inputs to the facility inspection detail screen, the system will assign an
   overall rating of excellent, satisfactory, marginal or unsatisfactory to each facility. Unit
   commanders must be made aware of facilities with marginal or unsatisfactory ratings, and
   actions need to be programmed in RFMIS to correct the deficiencies.
AFRSI32-9002 13 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                 13


32. Maintaining Facility Records. RFMIS is the storage area for case history files for each
facility location. Office information should match the data on the Unit Manning Document
(UMD).
   32.1. One or more office numbers may be assigned per USACE lease number. For enlisted
   production offices, use four characters to identify recruiting office numbers. Normally, the
   first two characters will be numeric and the last two characters will be alpha. The first two
   characters of the office number will identify the squadron. The last two characters will
   identify the office designator within a particular flight.          EXCEPTION: Squadron
   headquarters office number where all four characters are numeric. For example, AFRO 3200
   is the 332 RCS Headquarters. For an office occupied by a flight chief, the last character of
   each office designator will be a zero (for example, 32B0). For an office occupied by officer
   recruiters, the first character will begin with an “H”, followed by a numeric/alpha/numeric
   character.
   32.2. As a minimum, unit recruiting facility files must contain the following documents for
   each facility:
       32.2.1. The lease and any lease renewal supplemental agreement, permit, and right of
       entry or GSA space assignment document, as applicable for the present location
       (downloaded from RFMIS).
       32.2.2. Current annual facility inspection data (current calendar year and previous year’s
       data).
       32.2.3. A current floor plan of the location, showing window locations, column
       locations, dimensions and square footage for all services at the location (downloaded
       from RFMIS). Whenever USACE replaces a floor plan (as a result of a new office,
       relocation, expansion or space reconfiguration action), the unit POC should ensure
       USACE has loaded the most current floor plan(s) into RFMIS.
       32.2.4. A schedule of janitorial services (downloaded from RFMIS). Unit POCs are to
       be aware of scheduled services and brief recruiters and flight chiefs on the importance of
       ensuring offices are manned during scheduled visits. This a contracted service and
       results in wasted funds if offices cannot be serviced as required by contract.
   32.3. Each unit POC will ensure the facility address is correct (to include street name, suite
   numbers, town, city and zip code), and telephone information for each office in the RFMIS
   facility location screen. The address on the location screen should match the address on the
   lease.
33. Monitoring Program Execution. Units will monitor the status of their real estate actions
during the program FY. Obtain estimated action completion dates and project status data
through RFMIS screen queries or reports. Review this data at least monthly.
   33.1. Units should closely coordinate with and advise USACE on the dates that high priority
   actions are needed in order to support mission critical activities (such as, expansions and new
   offices to support new recruiters).

  33.2. Refer concerns with program execution to HQ AFRS/RSXLR for resolution.
