     HAZMAT they may come in contact with during the performance of their duties, in
     accordance with AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication (HAZCOM): Refer to Material Safety
     Data Sheets (MSDS) for particular hazards and precautionary measures for specific
     chemicals. The specific manufacturers and Hazardous Material management system
     (HMMS) MSDS sheets are available at each of the Hazardous Materials Issue Points (HMIP)
     identified       in        section        3.2.4         and        on          line        at
     https://wem0ws002.wrightpatterson.afmc.ds.af.mil/; a password is required for access.
        1.2.1. Supervisors will use their shop’s annual or biennial bioenvironmental surveys to
        ensure shop processes are properly addressed with appropriate public health information
        and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements. Section supervisors will
        maintain their shop personnel roster with the HAZMAT Cell using WPAFB FORM 1408
        (Supervisor/Employee Movement Input). This roster needs to be updated annually via
        the Issue Point Manager (IPM). Supervisors should complete the form for each new
        person as they in process the work center. Supervisors will complete waiver requests for
        ozone depleting chemicals for use by their personnel. The ozone depleting chemicals
        normally used within the wing are Halons for servicing aircraft refrigerators, fire
        extinguishers and Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) air conditioners, refrigeration
        and air conditioning servicing conducted by Civil Engineering Squadron (CES)

            petroleum products and filters; Building 34024 for used paint cans and spray cans;
            Building 34026 for used petroleum products and metal petroleum cans. There are
            numerous white paper and cardboard dumpsters throughout the wing facilities for
            recycling of those products as well as internally in our buildings for recycling paper
            and soft drink containers. You can contact the 88th Services Recycling Center by
            calling 7-4889 and leaving a message for pick up of full containers or for additional
            information.
3. Hazardous Waste:
     3.1. Six HAZWASTE, IAPs are located within the 445 MXG. Various types of HW are
     accumulated, managed, processed and shipped for disposal at all six locations. Three of the
     HAZWASTE IAPs are located adjoining HMIPs for security and processing when a material
     or container is returned as a HAZWASTE. Primary and alternate managers are authorized a
     key and will manage the HAZWASTE IAPs, IAW WPAFB Hazardous Waste Management
     Plan. The only other key authorized is in the possession of the 445 AW Environmental
     Program Managers. Under no circumstances are there to be additional keys made and kept in
     work centers.        Below is a link to form 1438 for turning in fluorescent bulbs
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil//Database/Staging/1524721/WP_Form_1438_HW_Pickup_Re
     quest.pdf. Fill in the form and FAX it to Environmental Management at 6-1210. We will
     enter it in the system and have the bulbs picked up by our contactor. They usually do this on
     Wednesday each week. It is important that there is a good contact person and phone number
     so they can arrange the pick-up. It is best to store bulbs until the box is full. This will prevent
     loose bulbs in the box, which will prevent breakage. The box for the bulbs should be taped
     shut. The quantity of bulbs should be marked on both ends of the box. If you need a boxes
     for the bulbs contact me. You need to fill in the following fields on form 1438 in Attachment
     2.
        3.1.1. Primary and alternate managers are listed by letter of appointment by the 445 AW
        Commander and will be contacted if a HAZWASTE is generated or the potential for a
        HAZWASTE to be generated is encountered within any work center. Any questions and
        or concerns can be address to the 445 AW EPM Greg Kern 656-2877 Cell (937) 657-
        1619. The HW normally collected …at each HAZWASTE IAP listed below…
            3.1.1.1. IAP C-008, Building 34026, Rooms 107B and 107F, Electro-Environmental
            Shop:

              3.1.1.6.1. Oil Analysis process materials and lubricants.
   3.2. Establish any necessary IAPs for the collection and temporary storage of HW. Each
   storage area must have a posted WPAFB Form 1433 issued by 88ABW/EMY, WPAFBVA
   32-1, Initial Accumulation Point (IAP) Daily Checklist/Guidance and a Site-Specific Spill
   Plan approved by 88ABW/EM. Each site must also have a Continuity Binder at the site
   containing a WPAFB Form 1436, IAP Container Tracking Log, WPAFB Form 1437, IAP
   Weekly Inspection Log, and current training records. A primary and alternate site manager
   must be appointed by the organizational Commander for each storage area in accordance
   with the WPAFB HW Management Plan.
4. Access to Hazardous Waste Initial Accumulation Points:
   4.1. Access to HAZWASTE IAPs is restricted to personnel who have been trained to handle
   HAZWASTE. This training is mandatory in accordance with 40, Code of Federal
   Regulations (CFR) and is required for all personnel who generate hazardous waste. If a
   hazardous waste is generated in a work center then all of the work center’s personnel must be
   trained to handle the hazardous waste generated. This training is required annually and has
   been coded in the G081 system to assist in tracking. Shop supervisors will ensure their
   personnel maintain currency in training to meet the federal code. The 445 AW
   Environmental Program Manager or alternate will be contacted if there is a requirement to
   access the HAZWASTE IAP when the primary and alternate managers are not available.
   Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to access the HAZWASTE IAP without
   current authorization.
   4.2. Hazardous Waste Initial Accumulation Point Disposal Procedures:
      4.2.1. Work centers must consult the MSDS with the HAZWASTE IAP manager or
      alternate for the HAZWASTE generated to help determine hazards of the waste
      generated. The MSDSs are available in the shop, through the HMIP and are available on
      line at https://wem0ws002.wrightpatterson.afmc.ds.af.mil/. Due to product and
      process knowledge, work center personnel may also be required to provide assistance to
10                                                      445AWI32-7001 31 AUGUST 2011


     HAZWASTE IAP managers in consolidating, packaging and/or preparing the
     HAZWASTE generated for storage or shipment.
     4.2.2. HAZWASTE will not be dropped off in front of or left next to, by, at, or near a
     HMIP or HAZWASTE IAP storage area unsecured. HAZMAT will not be placed in trash
     dumpsters or recycling containers. Ensure all hazardous materials or wastes are properly
     identified to the appropriate manager prior to leaving the HAZWASTE IAP storage area.

Terms
Bar Coded Label—–A self-adhesive label attached to each container of HAZMAT identifying
the contents by national stock number and serial number. This label information is used to track
where the HM is located, to whom it was issued, when it was returned to the HAZMAT Issue
Point (IP) for further use, when it was consumed or emptied and when proper disposal action
was accomplished. The label is yellow with black lettering and must not be removed from any
HAZMAT container.
Serial Number—–The HAZMAT serial number is located below the bar code on the bar-coded
label. Hazardous Material––Any substance, in any quantity or form that has the potential to
harm human health or the environment.
Hazardous Materials Pharmacy (HMP)—–A centralized process for procurement, receiving,
tracking, and distribution of HMS. The Hazardous Material Cell (HMC) office on Wright-
Patterson AFB OH provides management oversight of the HMP program and is responsible for
tracking and controlling HAZMAT
Hazardous Material Issue Point (HMIP)—–An element of the HMP, similar to a medical
pharmacy. The HMIP facilitates procurement, and receives, stores and issues all HAZMAT

issued to authorized unit personnel. The HMIP tracks HAZMAT until returned for reuse, is
empty and/or declared hazardous waste (HW). Several of the 445th AW HMIPs are collocated
with a HW Initial Accumulation Point (IAP) where generated hazardous waste is collected for
proper disposal action. There are four HMIPs within the 445th AW. These HMIPs are located in
Buildings 30013, 34024 and 34026 in Area C on the East and West Ramps. Each HMIP has an
assigned primary and alternate issue point manager (IPM) who is responsible for the issuance,
tracking, and usage requirements of all hazardous materials associated with their individual
HMIPs.
Hazardous Waste (HW)—–Is a hazardous material by-product that can pose a substantial or
potential hazard to human health or to the environment when improperly managed. Hazardous
waste is typically toxic, corrosive, flammable, explosive, and/or chemically reactive. A
HAZMAT container, when empty, may be considered HW and must be disposed of according to
AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance. The 445th AW has 5 HAZWASTE IAPs
where hazardous waste is generated and collected for proper disposal action.
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)—–A summary of safety, health, and emergency response
information provided by the product manufacturer or distributor as required by OSHA. The
MSDS contains information about the material ingredients, hazards, and personal protective
equipment required or recommended during its use.
