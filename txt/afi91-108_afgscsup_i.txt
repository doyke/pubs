                               PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Section 1A—Program Applicability and Objectives

1.1. Purpose:
   1.1.1. This Instruction provides specific guidance for operations involving RAM covered by
   the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. § 2011 et seq., commonly termed Section 91(b).
   RAM under the 91(b) designation within the scope of this Instruction are: current nuclear
   weapons material, legacy nuclear weapons maintenance wastes, residuals from nuclear
   weapons accidents, residuals from aircraft washdown operations from atmospheric testing of
   nuclear weapons, and residuals from nuclear reactor operations.
   1.1.2. This Instruction does not apply to RAM covered under AFI 40-201, Managing
   Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force, or 91(b) RAM covered under AFI 91-110,
   Nuclear Safety Review and Launch Approval for Space or Missile Use of Radioactive
   Material and Nuclear Systems. Note: this Instruction references AFI 40-201 as some
   processes from that Instruction may be applicable to INRAD safety.
1.2. Program Applicability:
   1.2.1. Implementation of the INRAD safety program and the ALARA concept must consider
   weapons safety, security, reliability, and operational mission requirements. The ALARA
   concept is further defined and explained in AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection. Note:
   most Technical Order (T.O.) procedures have inherent ALARA principles that reduce the
   potential for exposure.
      1.2.1.1. Units with a contingency or limited nuclear mission must comply with the
      ALARA concept.
      1.2.1.2. Host installations that support nuclear-capable tenants or geographically
      separated units (GSUs) must comply with this Instruction.
      1.2.1.3. Use the following as primary methods to achieve ALARA:
          1.2.1.3.1. Minimize the time individuals spend in the vicinity of weapon systems.
          1.2.1.3.2. Maximize distance between the source(s) of ionizing radiation and working
          area.
          1.2.1.3.3. Use shielding techniques, when appropriate.
          1.2.1.3.4. Implement a combination of these actions.
   1.2.2. Units that generate radioactive waste and/or mixed (i.e., chemical and radioactive)
   waste from nuclear weapons maintenance procedures must comply with this Instruction.
   1.2.3. CONUS installations that possess residual 91(b) RAM-contaminated buildings, burial
   sites, etc. from past (legacy) nuclear weapons accidents, incidents and maintenance, or
   dismantled/decommissioned 91(b) nuclear reactors (still under AF possession), or other
   residual 91(b) RAM must comply with this Instruction.

1.3. Program Objectives:
     1.3.1. Limit the risk of radiation-induced effects to a reasonable level in relation to the
     requirements of the USAF mission, other societal or military risks, benefits gained and
     economic factors.
     1.3.2. Manage 91(b) RAM associated with current nuclear weapons maintenance operations
     and residual 91(b) RAM from CONUS legacy maintenance, nuclear weapon
     accident/incidents, and AF 91(b) reactors.

Terms
91(a) Material—Radioactive material exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section
91(a) of the AEA of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession
of the DOE.
91(b) Material—Radioactive material exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section
91(b) of the AEA of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession
of the DOD. These include materials in nuclear weapons.
Annual—Recurring, done, or performed every year (i.e. every 12 months).
As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)—The concept that personnel exposures must be
maintained as low as possible consistent with existing technology, cost, and operational
requirements.
Low—Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)—LLRW is any radioactive waste that is not high-
level radioactive waste, uranium tailings, or transuranic waste.
Legacy RAM Sites—Sites contaminated from historical nuclear weapons maintenance,
accidents, or reactor residuals. This covers maintenance on unsealed weapons and accidents that
occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.
Mixed Waste—Waste that contains hazardous waste and source, special nuclear, or byproduct
material subject to the AEA of 1954 (i.e., material regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission).
Mishap—For purposes of this Instruction, a mishap is defined in AFI 91-202. It is an event
involving human acts of omission or commission involving a nuclear reactor, radioisotope power
system, or radioactive material resulting in a loss of control of radioactive material that presents
a hazard to life, health, or property. This includes loss of control that may result in any person in
an unrestricted area exceeding the limits for exposure to ionizing radiation as stated in AFI 48-
148.
