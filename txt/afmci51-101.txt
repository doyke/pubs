This instruction sets out the procedures for proposing changes to Federal law to improve AFMC’s ability
to accomplish its mission. This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard or US Air Force
Reserve units and members. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this pub-
lication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at http://www.e-publish-
ing.af.mil/forms-pubs/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision updates procedures for submission and processing proposed legislative initiatives.


1. Process Initiation. AFMC/JA will send out periodic requests, at least annually, to HQ AFMC two-let-
ter Directorates for legislative initiative proposals. The request will include submission requirements, as
necessary, including formatting requirements. The Directorates (including JA) shall in turn solicit propos-
als from their own respective field offices on topics within their functional areas. Proposals will be
accepted on a rolling basis. The absence of a hard suspense deadline enables the initiating office to estab-
lish its own internal suspense and procure written positive support of the proposed legislative change from
their Air Staff functional counterpart as described in paragraph 2. AFMC/JA will include submission
requirements in the request, including formatting requirements, utilizing the most current requirements
published by SAF/LL.

2. Sponsoring Directorate.
   2.1. The HQ AFMC two-digit directorate with functional area responsibility over the subject matter
   of the proposed legislation shall be the evaluator and sponsor of that proposal. Evaluators should
   apply a four part test:
2                                                                        AFMCI51-101 11 APRIL 2008


       2.1.1. Is a change in federal law required?
       2.1.2. Does the proposal appear to have merit?
       2.1.3. Is the proposal likely to receive support from HHQ?
       2.1.4. Does the proposal duplicate a proposal previously submitted?
    2.2. If the sponsoring directorate’s evaluation leads to a conclusion that the proposal should not be
    pursued, then no further action is required on that proposal.
    2.3. If the sponsoring directorate’s evaluation concludes the proposal should be pursued further, then
    that directorate will seek written coordination from its Air Staff functional area counterpart. If favor-
    able written coordination cannot be obtained, then no further action will be taken on that proposal.
    2.4. If favorable written coordination is obtained as discussed above in paragraph 2.3., the sponsoring
    directorate will then submit the proposal, along with coordination documentation, to HQ AFMC/JA.

3. HQ AFMC/JA Role.
    3.1. HQ AFMC/JA verifies that proposals meet specified form requirements for eventual submission
    to SAF/LL. If the proposal fails to meet current standards, HQ AFMC/JA returns the proposal to the
    sponsoring directorate for corrective action.
    3.2. HQ AFMC/JA will staff proposals for coordination by HQ AFMC staff and will forward coordi-
    nated proposals to AFMC/CC for approval and submission to the appropriate Air Staff functional
    sponsor.
    3.3. Following selection by AFMC/CC, AFMC/JA forwards the proposals through the functional
    two-letter Directorate to its Air Staff functional area counterpart, and will periodically track progres-
    sion of the proposals through to enactment, or other disposition that may occur.
