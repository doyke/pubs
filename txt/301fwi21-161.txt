301FWI21-161 16 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  3


     3.1.2. In-shop CTKs must remain locked when not in use unless they are stored in a
     place that is constantly manned or secured. When a work center is not large enough to
     facilitate a manned tool room, the shop supervisor is responsible for an itemized
     inventory of all tools and equipment at the beginning and end of each shift. All CTKs
     will be locked at the close of the normal business day.
  3.2. Control: Store CTKs, tools, and equipment in a designated location for positive control
  and ease of inventory. Personnel are responsible for control of the CTK and equipment they
  sign out.
  3.3. Accountability:
     3.3.1. All 301 MXG maintenance areas that use CTKs or maintain aircraft related
     parts/equipment will use the Tool Accountability System (TC-MAX) to account for
     CTKs and equipment as directed by AFI 21-101, AFRC Sup 1, Aircraft and Equipment
     Maintenance Management, Chapter 10, Tool and Equipment Management. Personnel are
     accountable for the CTK and equipment they sign out.
     3.3.2. CTKs will be marked with nine-digit Equipment Identification Designators as
     identified in Attachment 2. The 9-digit Equipment Identification Designators (EID)
     must be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box
     may be marked with less than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit World Wide
     Identification (WWID) and identifying characters that tie the tool back to the CTK.
         3.3.2.1. Electronic devices Land Mobil Radio (LMR)’s, e-tools, etc.) will be assigned
         an EID and controlled through TC-MAX.
         3.3.2.2. Radio/Laptop Batteries are considered consumable. Batteries not tracked in
         TC-MAX must be marked with the owning unit, section, or workcenter id.
     3.3.3. Tool and Equipment Identification: maintenance will be identified with an EID
     for accountability purposes.
         3.3.3.1. EIDs marked on tools must be clear, legible and easy to read.
         3.3.3.2. If security devices (i.e., cables, locking bar, etc.) are not permanently
         attached to the CTK, mark the items with the EID and add them to the MIL.
         3.3.3.3. Tools marked with two different CTK numbers are considered double etched
         and are not authorized. Double etched is considered as any part of a previous EID
         number that may be legible. Tools that have laser etched CTK numbers for enhanced
         legibility may have the non-applicable or old EID numbers removed by etching or
         lasering a continuous line through the old CTK number, (S4QA00001). It is not
         considered double etched if marked with the correct EID more than once.
         3.3.3.4. Locks (if applicable) and keys will be listed as separate items on the MIL
         and count toward the MIL total. Locks that are not permanently attached will be
         etched with CTK EID. Keys will be always be etched with CTK EID.
         3.3.3.5. Toolbox foam will not be listed on the MIL or count toward the MIL total.
         3.3.3.6. Removable tool trays will be etched with the CTK EID, listed on the MIL
         and count toward MIL total.

            3.3.3.7. FOD Bags will be etched with the CTK EID, listed on the MIL and count
            toward MIL total.
        3.3.4. Only CTK custodians are allowed to make pen/pencil changes on a MIL.
4. Control of Personal Equipment (ear defenders, headsets, etc. ). Personal equipment such
as ear defenders/headsets which are issued to an individual will be controlled by one of the two
procedures listed below:
     4.1. Items will be marked with a CTK identification number and kept within a CTK. These
     items will be controlled as a tool.
     4.2. Items may be kept, maintained, and controlled by the person issued the item. As a
     minimum, these items will be marked with an EID. The EID will contain 9 characters,
     numbers and letters. The first four characters will be the world wide identification (WWID)
     code; ex, “S4AT”. The last five characters will be the individual’s employee number.
5. Inventory.
     5.1. Annual. All tools and Support Equipment (SE) containing accessories are completely
     inventoried annually or when CTK custodian changes. The purpose of this inventory is to
     perform a comprehensive inspection of all tools and SE and is more extensive than the daily
     beginning and end of shift inventory. The CTK custodian/alternate performs the inventory.
     When CTK custodians change, the outgoing and incoming CTK custodians perform the
     inventory together. CTK custodians will maintain a MIL for each type of kit assigned to the
     work center. MILs will be updated annually and when the CTK custodian changes to ensure
     accuracy. The listings will be signed by the applicable flight Office in Charge (OIC),
     NCOIC, Flight, or Section Chief. The annual inventory will consist of:
        5.1.1. Ensure the MIL in the CTK matches the MIL in TC-MAX (also applies to SE with
        accessories)
        5.1.2. Ensure the MIL matches the contents of the CTK or SE
