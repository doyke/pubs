AFI 91-207_AFMCSUP_, 22 May 2007, is supplemented as follows:
This supplement defines how the Ogden Air Logistics Center Safety Office (75 ABW/SE) will
implement the motorcycle training requirements defined in AFI 91-207 The US Air Force Traffic
Safety Program. This supplement applies to workforce members of all units, Air Force Materiel
Command (AFMC), Air Combat Command (ACC), and Air Force Reserve Command AFRC on
Hill AFB, and any other units making use of this motorcycle training program. Compliance with
this supplement is mandatory; failure to comply is punishable as a violation of Article 92,
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or appropriate administrative action for civilian
personnel. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.
1.2.3.5.1. (Added) Motorcycle riders will carry proof of training (see paragraph 4.6.7.2.1.) with
them any time when riding a motorcycle on base. Additionally, for those individuals not
required to take the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) courses per paragraph 4.6.1. in the
basic AFI, a valid state driverâ€™s license with appropriate motorcycle endorsement satisfies this
paragraph. The proof will be available for display if requested when entering the base or any
time requested by law enforcement personnel.
1.2.4.4.1.1. (Added) 75 ABW/SE funds the MSF courses. Volunteer rider coaches provide the
training for the motorcycle program. Because of the importance of the program and the time and
                               AFI91-207_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP 25 NOVEMBER 2008


money invested into each rider coach it is important that prospective rider coaches and their
supervisors understand the commitment required. A sample memorandum of agreement is
included in Attachment 5 which defines requirements and responsibilities.
1.2.5.5. (Added) Before initially painting, or restriping parking areas, allow for and mark a
suitable number of motorcycle parking spots, preferably separated from other vehicle parking.
1.2.7.3.7. (Added) Unit Motorcycle Safety Coordinators (UMSCâ€™s) will verify the accuracy of
data annually and provide proof of verification to 75 ABW/SE.
1.2.7.4.       (Added)            75      ABW/SE       provides  a    web-based      tool   at
https://hillnet.hill.af.mil/hafb/alc/se/safety/moto/moto_UMSC/index.php. This tool can be used
to fulfill the documentation requirements of paragraph 1.2.7.
2.2.3.1. (Added) These assets need to travel to the Logistics Readiness Squadronâ€™s Vehicle
Management Flight to have maintenance performed on them just like other registered assets. To
do this they must travel on Wardleigh Road which has a posted speed limit of 40 mph in
different sections. These registered Low Speed Vehicles (LSVs) have clearance to travel on this
roadway with a slow moving vehicle placard/sign attached to the rear of the vehicle to ensure
other vehicles are aware that they are traveling slower than the posted speed limit.
3.4.2.4.5. Military uniforms are not considered brightly colored or reflective.
3.4.2.8.1. (Added) The tool identified in paragraph 1.2.7.4. can be used to document this
requirement.
3.6.2.1. (Added) No motorcycle riders, regardless of affiliation, will be allowed to operate a
motorcycle on base without a valid motorcycle endorsement. Motorcycle learner permits do not
satisfy this requirement. Individuals with a learnerâ€™s permit taking either of the motorcycle
training courses may only ride to and from the training rooms and on the motorcycle range.
4.1.1.1. (Added) Employees cannot be compensated for time spent at motorcycle training
outside of their normal work schedule. For example, the Basic Rider Course lasts three days. If
the course is taught Thursday through Saturday, employees will not be paid for Saturday if that is
not a normal work day. For the portion of the course taught during normal duty hours,
employees will not be forced to take leave or use compensatory time to attend the course. If an
employeeâ€™s normal work schedule is not the day shift, supervisors will make every effort to
temporarily change the employees shift to coincide with the class being taught.
4.1.1.2. (Added) Only courses taught at Hill AFB are covered by this supplement. Equivalent
courses taught off-base by local vendors may be substituted for the required initial course;
however, the employee is responsible for the cost and time involved. For course information and
availability, please contact 75ABW/SEG at 777-3333, extension 2 or register for classes at
https://hillnet.hill.af.mil/hafb/alc/se/safety/moto/index.php.
4.6.2. (Added) Due to variable weather conditions, and the large number of riders requiring
training each year, immediate training is not always available. Class sign-up is available via the
motorcycle training web site listed in paragraph 4.1.1.2. (Added). If classes are not available
contact 75 ABW/SEG to coordinate a class date. The safety office motorcycle coordinator will
evaluate what classes are available, how long the student has been trying to schedule a class, and
any other pertinent information to determine if conditions warrant procurement of alternate
training options. If a student pays for a commercially available class in the local community not
AFI91-207_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP 25 NOVEMBER 2008


procured in advance or authorized by 75 ABW/SE, the costs for that class will not be
reimbursed.
4.6.2.1. (Added) Course cancellation is accomplished via the same web site used to sign up for
a course. Except on a case-by-case basis, individuals who cancel less than 48 hours prior to a
class and/or fail to show up for a scheduled class will be given the lowest priority for enrolling in
a future class. Those individuals may be forced to wait until the following year to get into a
training class.
4.6.7.1.3. (Added) The Experienced Riders Course (ERC) is intended for riders who are
competent motorcycle riders. The decision to sign up for the Basic Ridersâ€™ Course (BRC) or
ERC rests with the student; however rider coaches teaching the ERC may ask students to leave
the class at any time based on their proficiency. Students who are asked to leave a class may
sign up for an upcoming BRC but will not receive any priority for being previously enrolled in
the ERC.
4.6.7.1.4. (Added) Motorcycle class students are required to come to training with a motorcycle
and proper protective gear. The rider coach instructing the class has the option to ask students to
leave the class if the motorcycle is not in an adequate state of repair or if the student does not
have the proper protective gear. Students may sign up for another course but will not receive any
priority for being previously enrolled.
4.6.7.2.1. (Added) There are individuals who completed approved motorcycle safety courses
before the MSF existed and/or was a requirement. In order to accommodate those individuals,
the following forms of proof of training will be accepted as meeting the AFI 91-207 training
requirement.
4.6.7.2.1.1. (Added) Valid MSF card: An MSF card, signed by the rider coach, is presented to
each individual after they successfully complete one of the MSF courses. Replacement cards are
available for individuals who took the MSF course after 2003 and are in the motorcycle training
database maintained by 75 ABW/SE. A sample MSF card is shown in Attachment 3.
4.6.7.2.1.2. (Added) Valid 75 ABW/SE motorcycle card: 75 ABW/SE will provide individuals
a card if they can provide proof of completing an approved motorcycle safety course. These
cards will be valid for two years from date of issue. During those two years it is expected
individuals will complete a free one-day MSF Experienced Rider Course offered by 75
ABW/SE. A sample 75 ABW/SE motorcycle card is shown in Attachment 6.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL HILL AFB MOTORCYCLE RIDER COACHES


FROM: 75 ABW/SE


SUBJECT: Expectations for Trained Motorcycle Rider Coaches


1. Thank you for volunteering to become a motorcycle rider coach in support of the Hill AFB
motorcycle program! The ability to use riders from the on-base community benefits the program
both from a financial and a practical stand point. Your training allows us to train hundreds of
new riders every year with very little investment. The program also allows you to receive
valuable training at no expense to you. Finally, to have rider coaches, who are familiar with the
on-base environment, teach the classes helps to strengthen the safe attitude toward motorcycles
the program is designed to create.
2. In order to justify the time and expense spent training rider coaches, it is necessary to set
expectations for the rider coach, his/her supervisor, and the program itself.
   a. The installation safety office will provide the rider coach training and initial training
materials at no cost for all new rider coaches. You must coordinate with your supervisors to
attend this training.
   b. The rider coach will make himself/herself available for the entire length of the rider coach
training.
   c. Once trained, the rider coach is responsible for signing up to teach classes and being
responsible for that time slot. Unplanned events are bound to happen, but it is the responsibility
of the rider coach to arrange for backup and/or trade training dates. If a backup cannot be found,
the installation safety office must be informed a week in advance, or as soon as it is apparent that
substitute rider coaches cannot be found, whichever is earlier.
   d. Once trained, it is expected rider coaches will teach for a minimum of five years. If you are
PCSâ€™d during that timeframe, we hope you continue to share your knowledge and expertise.
During those five years, it is expected that each rider coach will teach a minimum of 50 hours
per season.
   e. There will be a pre-season meeting, typically in March, that all rider coaches are required to
attend along with 75 ABW/SE representation to discuss the schedule of the upcoming season.
   f. Supervisors will provide Rider Coaches time away from their primary duty to teach the
required courses without charge to leave. If unusual occurrences arise, please contact the
installation safety office to coordinate. By signing this agreement, supervisors agree to release
Rider Coaches for their required teaching hours (paragraph d above) when required by the
training schedule.
                                AFI91-207_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP 25 NOVEMBER 2008


   g. Because rider coaches are on the motorcycle course and using the training materials on a
regular basis, it is expected that any problems (deteriorating paint, damaged cones, etc.) will be
brought to the attention of the installation safety office.
  h. Finally, the installation safety office has the responsibility to administer the program. We
will work any issues, assuming we are given the information.
3. Please sign the letter below indicating you have read, understand and agree to the
expectations. Please have your supervisor sign, indicating his/her agreement to allow you to
support the program. Once both have signed, please return this letter to the installation safety
office.
4. Thanks again for volunteering to be a motorcycle rider coach! We appreciate your time and
effort helping to keep the Hill AFB motorcycle riders safe. Obviously, the program could not be
accomplished without your energetic support.
