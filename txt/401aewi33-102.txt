This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-102, Command, Control, Communi-
cations, and Computer (C4) Systems, and provides guidance from AFI 33-106 Managing High Frequency
Radios, Personal Wireless Communication Systems, and Military Affiliated Radio Systems, as well as
USAFE supplement 1 to AFI 33-106. The purpose of this instruction is to establish 401 AEW policy on
the management, acquisition, and control of Cellular Telephones (CT), Land Mobile Radios (LMR) and
other PWCS items. This instruction will be reviewed annually to ensure its currency and applies to all
401AEW units. Proposed changes to this publication should be sent to 401AEW/CCEA for wing staff
coordination. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance
with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.


1. PURPOSE.
   1.1. The mission of the 401 AEW requires key personnel to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
   week. PWCS’ are the tools utilized to allow freedom of movement while ensuring a constant and reli-
   able means of communication is maintained. Failure to reach personnel when needed seriously jeop-
   ardizes our ability to perform the mission.

2. GENERAL.
   2.1. The Unit Commander will appoint a PWCS custodian in writing.
   2.2. Commanders will ensure custodians inventory and document unit accounts during transition of
   custodial duties.
       2.2.1. Discrepancies will be resolved prior to departure of the departing custodian. NOTE:
       “resolved” means the item has been accounted for, voluntary repayment was made, or a Report of
       Survey (ROS) was initiated.

       2.2.2. Repayments are made by submitting a DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization.
       Contact 401 AEW/FM for specified fund cite information.
       2.2.3. A Report of Survey (ROS) is initiated for lost, damaged, or stolen Air Force property. ROS
       is accomplished IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, and 401 AEWI
       23-101, Supply Operations.
       2.2.4. The unit commander at each site is the “Responsible Officer” for ROS actions.
    2.3. PWCS custodians will manage their accounts IAW AFI 33-106, Managing High Frequency
    Radios, Personal Wireless Communication Systems, and the Military Affiliate Radio System and the
    USAFE Supplement 1. Each unit will maintain a current copy of these procedures in the same folder/
    binder with the current PWCS inventory. Custodians will send a signed copy of appointment letters,
    training certification letters, and inventory documents to 401 AEW/SC. 401 AEW/SC will ensure
    copies of these documents are forwarded to the 31 CS PWCS manager.
       2.3.1. Updates are accomplished by the Base PWCS Office, which utilizes the Tracking and
       Reporting System (TRS) database. LMRs, CT, Pagers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) with
       Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI) modules/attachments, and Intra-Squad Radios (ISR) oper-
       ating in the 380-399.9 MHz band are tracked in TRS.
       2.3.2. Exception: Cellular Telephones, Pagers, PDAs, and ISR devices costing less than $500.00
       are no longer tracked in TRS, unless they are equipped with CCI modules/attachments. The using
       organization is responsible for management and tracking of these assets costing less than $500.00.
       PDAs costing over $500.00 are accounted for using the 31 CS Information Processing Manage-
       ment System (IPMS), which manages Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) accounts,
       in accordance with AFI 33-112, Computer Systems Management.
       2.3.3. Requests for new and disposition of old or excess equipment will be IAW 401 AEWI
       33-101, C4 Systems Management. Note: Radio equipment must have frequency approval from the
       Base Spectrum Manager before purchase or use.

3. CELLULAR TELEPHONES (CT). Cellular telephones provide users a rapid means of communica-
tion, however security risks and additional costs accompany this convenience. To reduce risks and costs,
all cellular telephone users must understand and comply with the following guidelines.
    3.1. Do not discuss classified, sensitive, or Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI) when
    using cellular telephones.
    3.2. Using unsecure cellular telephones for operational communication is a violation of the guidance
    established in AFI 33-202, Network and Computer Security.
    3.3. Cellular telephones, two-way radios, two-way beepers and other electronic equipment capable of
    receiving and transmitting signals are prohibited in all areas where sensitive information may be dis-
    cussed or processed per USAFE/CC memo titled: “Protecting Our Sensitive Communications and
    Personnel Policy”.
    3.4. Government procured cellular phones are for official or sanctioned use only.
    3.5. Think before you call as cellular telephone use may incur long distance charges even if the sender
    and receiver are only a few feet away.

  3.6. Placing a call over a cellular telephone is authorized only when other more economical means of
  communications are not available. (i.e. commercial, DSN telephones, and LMR’s).
  3.7. Do not use cellular telephones to access the Internet.
  3.8. Cellular telephone users who fail to comply with mandatory policies will have their phone privi-
  leges revoked and may be subject to administrative action.
  3.9. Cellular Telephone (CT) Procedures:
     3.9.1. Each unit’s PWCS custodian will assist 401 AEW Telephone Control Officer in reviewing
     and validating cellular telephone billing statements.
     3.9.2. The custodian will initiate new CT requirements and annual service reviews via AF Form
     3215, IT/NSS Requirement Document , IAW 401AEWI 33-101, C4 Systems Management. The
     AF Form 3215 request will be sent to 401 AEW/SC, who will route it to 31 CS for validation and
     implementation. NOTE: Validation is based on the CT requirements established in AFI 33-106.
     3.9.3. All other cellular phone requirements not processed through 401 AEW will follow proce-
     dures established by the organization processing the CT request.
     3.9.4. CT equipment such as batteries, chargers and cases are considered accessories. Accessories
     are not provided by the 31st Fighter Wing Communication Squadron and will be purchased with
     unit funds on the IMPAC Card.
  3.10. Cellular phones must be safeguarded at all times. Results from ROS will determine if any sub-
  sequent costs resulting from a lost, damaged, or stolen phone will be charged to the individual to
  whom the cell phone was issued. In the event your cellular phone is lost, damaged, or stolen, immedi-
  ately contact 401AEW/SC so prompt actions can be taken to cease phone service if necessary.
