                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Purpose. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2650, Maintenance Training, establishes training
policy and procedures for personnel assigned to aircraft, munitions, and missile maintenance
organizations throughout the Air Force.
1.2. Objective. Provide initial, upgrade, proficiency, qualification, recurring, and certification
training needed by a technician to perform duties in their primary Air Force Specialty Code
(AFSC). The overall capability of a maintenance unit depends on the state of training for
personnel assigned. Training is essential to improving and sustaining unit capability and is one
of the most important responsibilities of commanders and supervisors. When balancing
resources (e.g., aircraft, support equipment, facilities, tools, funding, personnel, etc.),
maintenance training carries an equal priority with the operational training mission.
1.3. Applicability. This instruction is directive in nature and applicable to commanders,
supervisors, Unit Training Managers (UTM), and personnel assigned to the Maintenance Group
(MXG), maintenance squadrons, MTS, and other maintenance organizations throughout the Air
Force. It is applicable to Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force
Civilian maintenance personnel. MAJCOMs will supplement this document to further define
civilian training requirements.
     1.3.1. Performance-based activities (contractors and Most Efficient Organizations (MEO)
     will organize in accordance with (IAW) AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, and
     will implement the organization required in accordance with their contract or management
     plan. (T-2).
Note: Certain sections of this AFI are not applicable to Air Reserve Component (ARC),
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), and Nuclear units. Organizations that do not have a
Maintenance Training Section (MTS) will complete skill level training in their individual work
centers. (T-2). Refer to MAJCOM instructions for further guidance, where applicable. Specific
training requirements for Munitions and Missile maintenance activities are included in the
appropriate 21-2XX series instructions.
1.4. Equivalent Commanders. Throughout this instruction, responsibilities for the
Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) are identified. For those units that do not align
under a Maintenance Group (MXG), their appropriate commander is equivalent.
1.5. Terminology. When using this instruction, the following applies:
     1.5.1. Must - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
     1.5.2. Will - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
     1.5.3. Should - Indicates a preferred or recommended method or option.
     1.5.4. May - Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method or option.
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                         7


1.6. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The MTS is the single point of contact for
maintenance training within the MXG IAW AFI 36-2201 Air Force Training Program and this
publication.
Note: The UTM or civilian equivalent will serve as OPR for those units without an MTS. (T-2).
1.7. AETC Training Detachment (TD). (Applicable to Aircraft Maintenance (Mx) units
except ARC units). TD is the primary Aircraft Mx training agency on base. TD will develop a
support agreement between host suppliers and receivers of resources IAW applicable AFIs to
document recurring day-to-day peacetime support. (T-2). The support agreement should
address facilities, Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding, administrative support,
Government Vehicle (GOV) allocations; aircraft support equipment to include sustainment costs,
and organizational/intermediate maintenance support of equipment beyond the TD capability.
   1.7.1. Air Education and Training Command (AETC) TD will be utilized as the primary
   maintenance training resource at all bases with an assigned TD. The TD will not be
   responsible to conduct ancillary training. The MTS will develop courses and supplement
   training when the training requirements are beyond the capability and timely response of the
   TD. The MTS and TD will not duplicate training. During course reviews, any duplication of
   training will be reconciled.
   1.7.2. Student Travel Program for 982 TRG TD course. Submit travel and per diem cost for
   student travel to TD courses to 982 TRG/TXTGA, Sheppard AFB, TX for funding approval
   IAW AFI36-2201.

has been provided, notify 982 TRG/TXTGA and MAJCOM maintenance training branch as soon
as possible so the appropriate changes can take place.
1.8. MAJCOM Mandatory Course List (MMCL). (Applicable to Aircraft Mx units except
ARC). Lead Commands will create a master list of all mandatory TD, MTS, and Advanced
Distributed Learning (ADL) courses for each mission design series (MDS) aircraft. MAJCOMs
will conduct annual audits by reviewing monthly Status of Training reports to ensure all
personnel identified complete applicable MMCL courses (see paragraphs 8.3.3. and 8.3.4.).
1.9. Utilization of Training Courses. Units will use AETC, TD, MTS and ancillary training
courses for upgrade, proficiency, qualification, recurring, and Cross Utilization Training (CUT).
(T-2). These courses will be used to the fullest extent possible.
1.10. Class Cancellation Policy.
   1.10.1. TD classes with en-route, Temporary Duty (TDY), Air Reserve Component (ARC),
   or multi-phased students will not be canceled and will be supported by the host unit, unless
   approved by the wing commander.
   1.10.2. Host unit personnel will not be removed from TD courses due to appointments, local
   exercises, or higher headquarters inspections, unless approved by the wing commander.
   1.10.3. MXG/CC may cancel MTS classes during local exercises. The maintenance training
   operating instruction, developed by the MTS, will outline the cancellation policies for MTS
   classes.
 8                                                                   AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014


     1.10.4. Local students released from MTS/TD courses will report to their respective work
     centers.
1.11. Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC). (Not applicable to ARC and AFSOC units).

method to satisfy training requests. The CAC will be composed of MTS (Chairperson), UTM
(as required), TD (as required), Subject-Matter-Experts (SMEs), applicable work center
supervisors/section chiefs, and MTS OIC/Chief. (T-2).
     1.11.1. MTS will conduct a CAC when:
        1.11.1.1. Developing a new course.
        1.11.1.2. Deciding which training agency should conduct requested training.
        1.11.1.3. Revising 25% or more of an existing course.
     1.11.2. The MTS can use a CAC to conduct reviews of MTS courses and TD courses when
     necessary.
1.12. Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) (Not applicable to ARC and Air Force Special
Operations Command (AFSOC).
     1.12.1. The MTS and Base Education Services Officer (ESO), OPRs for ADL, will establish
     a memorandum of agreement (MOA) concerning administering ADL in maintenance
     organizations. (T-2). The MOA may be part of a larger host/tenant wing or group support
     agreement.

            1.12.1.1.4. Distribution of course materials, schedules, and announcements.
1.13. Cross-Utilization Training (CUT). CUT training provides the unit internal flexibility by
training individuals to perform tasks that are not in their primary AFSC. This training can offset
periods of austere or low skill level manning. It also enhances combat capability by developing
a pool of qualified personnel to draw upon during surges. Use care not to create a dependency
upon CUT trained personnel for every task. CUT should never be a long-term fix or management
solution for an AFSC shortfall. Ensure the training records of individuals receiving CUT are
appropriately documented. Be a qualified 5-level or 3-level that has completed all upgrade
requirements except minimum time in training.
Note: This guidance does not apply to Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) weapon systems or other
weapon systems where Air Force approved maintenance philosophy dictates the merger of
AFSCs.
1.14. Block Training (Not applicable to ARC units). Block training is a term used in the
maintenance community to describe the type of format used for training. MTS uses this format
to group training requirements into a single training session. Initial mission orientation and
refresher training are the most commonly conducted courses in the block-training format.
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                         9

Managers) SEIs are designed to identify personnel with special experience and rapidly identify
maintenance resources to meet management objectives. The purpose of this policy is to improve
the identification of experienced personnel, deployment/assignment equity, and maintenance
capability. It is not a means to classify maintenance proficiency levels or qualification levels.
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                       13


The objectives of this policy are to:
   1.21.1. Measure unit and MAJCOM experience levels and support appropriate management
   action to increase experience levels where needed.
   1.21.2. Ensure maintenance personnel who have relevant hands-on experience on aircraft,
   engines, and associated equipment/Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) are awarded all
   appropriate SEIs.
   1.21.3. Ensure all maintenance personnel are rotated to SEI-coded duty positions where
   relevant hands-on experience can be acquired within 36 months of date arrived station.
   1.21.4. Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TW). Aircraft/Munitions maintenance
   career field managers and MAJCOM functional managers will review SEIs in Air Force

       MAJCOM functional managers will:
           1.21.4.2.1. Monitor the status of experience levels at each base/unit via analysis of
           the numbers of personnel possessing SEIs versus the total number of personnel
           assigned within the AFSC/program element code (PEC).
           1.21.4.2.2. Identify, by name, those individuals assigned to a base/unit with more
           than 36 months Time On Station (TOS) and not awarded an SEI applicable to that
           base/unit. Provide this list to the MXG/CC/maintenance supervisor, superintendent
           for analysis/investigation.
           1.21.4.2.3. Ensure positions are coded at MAJCOM or base level. Monitor the
           coding of positions. A recommended measurement is the total number of Unit
           Manning Document (UMD) positions vs. the number of SEI coded positions in a
           given AFSC.
           1.21.4.2.4. Reporting procedures: MAJCOMs will provide a semi-annual report to
           HQ USAF/A4LF on 1 April and 1 October, summarizing the MAJCOM experience
           levels in each of the target AFSCs IAW specified reporting criteria. Reports will
           portray:
               1.21.4.2.4.1. The total number of personnel by Control Air Force Specialty Code
               (CAFSC) who have been assigned to a SEI coded or uncoded position with TOS
               of 18-24, 25-36, and more than 36 months who do not have a unit relevant SEI
               awarded to any AFSC. In addition, provide specific reasons/logic for each
               individual without being awarded SEI and greater than 36 months TOS.

        awarded AFSC when SEI awarding criteria contained in Air Force Enlisted
        Classification Directory has been met. They can be temporarily designated against
        the control AFSC, but only as a tracking mechanism to determine who will earn them.
        1.21.4.4.4. For multiple MDS units, initiate action to award additional relevant SEIs
        if/when an individual gains experience on additional MDSs. Award additional SEIs
        using AF Form 2096, Classification/On-The-Job Training Action, or P-series orders.
        1.21.4.4.5. Ensure that those personnel with 18-24 months TOS, without an SEI
        applicable to the unit of assignment and assigned to positions not coded with an
        airframe, engine, or sub-system SEI are rotated into positions where an applicable
        SEI may be earned and awarded.
  1.21.5. Code UMD positions in the following manner:
     1.21.5.1. Do not code Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), tool room, safety, vehicle
     NCOs, quality, or other staff/support functions with weapon system or engine SEIs.
     1.21.5.2. MAJCOMs must ensure that only those positions where relevant hands-on
     experience can be gained are coded with the weapons system/engine-specific SEI based
     upon the following guidelines:
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                           15

          2A7X3, 2A7X5,2A790, 2A8X1X, 2A8X2X, 2A9X1X, 2A9X2X, 2A9X3X and
          2W1X1 (including armament backshops).
          1.21.5.2.2. Code positions with either weapons systems/backshop avionics systems
          as determined by the lead command for Mobility Air Force (MAF)/Combat Air Force
          (CAF), or HQ AFSOC: 2A0X1X.
          1.21.5.2.3. Code positions with engine SEI where personnel can receive hands-on
          engine experience (flightline, Jet Engine Intermediate Maintenance (JEIM),
          Centralized Repair Facility (CRF), Phase/Isochronal dock, and test cell): 2A6X1X.
          1.21.5.2.4. Code electro-environmental (2A6X6) and hydraulics (2A6X5) back shop
          positions with weapon system SEI where personnel can receive hands-on experience
          (flightline, cannibalization and phase/isochronal inspection docks).
          1.21.5.2.5. Code Repair and Reclamation (R&R) shops with the R&R SEI.
          1.21.5.2.6. For units having positions on their UMD funded by another MAJCOM
          under a host/tenant or memorandum of agreement, code the positions with the
          coordination/approval of the funding MAJCOM.
          1.21.5.2.7. MAJCOMs may code additional positions with appropriate SEIs with the
          concurrence of the MAJCOM functional manager.
   1.21.6. Triggers. The trigger point is the point where, as a minimum, MAJCOM Functional
   Managers in coordination with AFPC will maintain an experience level based on the total
   number of personnel assigned in the AFSC vs. the number of personnel holding a wing
   applicable awarded SEI. The experience baseline will be set at 60%. However, MAJCOMs
   may develop their own trigger point, with justification. If experience levels in a specific
   AFSC fall below this point, MAJCOMs shall consider steps to help alleviate the situation.
   These may include Temporary Duty (TDY), manning assistance, assignment availability
   codes, using SEIs in the overseas selection/returnee allocations cycle, when available, to
   direct people with the required SEI into a particular location, or AF leveling using skill level,
   SEI, and time on station as the assignment selection criteria. Any request for assistance to
   AFPC will be accompanied by justification to include total personnel assigned in the AFSC,
   number of personnel in the wing holding an awarded, relevant SEI and the number of
   personnel with greater than 36 months’ time on station without an award of an SEI. Units
   with personnel on station longer than 36 months with no SEI awarded will have difficulty
   justifying their need for assistance.
Note: This trigger point does not affect or prevent SEI selection rates approved by MAJCOMs or
AFPC through normal channels.
1.22. The Maintenance Training Advisory Group (MATAG):
   1.22.1. Purpose. HQ USAF convenes the MATAG annually or as needed to provide a
   cohesive approach to improving readiness through better maintenance training. The MATAG
   reviews current maintenance training problems and successes, coordinates maintenance
 16                                                                 AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014


   training initiatives, and advises the Air Force A4L on overall maintenance training programs.
   In addition, the MATAG:
       1.22.1.1. Sets maintenance training goals and priorities.
       1.22.1.2. Reviews training programs impacting maintenance, including ancillary
       training, and recommends changes to program OPRs.
       1.22.1.3. Evaluates emerging training technologies.

   interested people may attend but may not vote. The 982TRG and AETC/A3TM are invited
   to be advisors to the MATAG.
   1.22.3. Will establish and perform annual reviews to the A4L approved MATAG charter.
1.23. Training Continuity Books. Develop and maintain a training continuity book for every
duty position in the MTS (electronic version is acceptable) (T-2).        Each book depicts
procedures for accomplishing tasks associated with each duty position. Write continuity books
to a standard that permits a newly appointed person to comply with existing policy and
procedures with minimal assistance.
Note: Combine the MTS Chief duty position and Training Management Section NCOIC duty
position tasks into one book.
1.24. Training Assessment Feedback. (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC and ICBM units). The
MTS. Superintendent serves as OPR for local administration for internal and Office of
Collateral Responsibility (OCR) for external feedback:

                    MAINTENANCE TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

3.1. Introduction. The purpose of this chapter is to provide training documentation and
evaluation instructions that are unique to maintenance career fields.
3.2. Training Documents.
   3.2.1. Use automated training documentation forms in Air Force and MAJCOM approved
   MIS
   3.2.2. Use AF FORM 2426, Training Request and Completion Notification, or approved
   electronic form, to request training, record training and certificate of completion. The
   electronic form must be mutually agreed upon by host wing MTS and TD.
   3.2.2.1. The group commander is the final approval authority for all versions of the AF
   FORM 2426.
   3.2.3. Use AF FORM 898 (not applicable to ARC units), or approved electronic form, to
   manage, forecast, and request unit TD training requirements. Use this form to identify,
   prioritize, and request wing TD course requirements. MTSs and TDs supporting AETC units
   will use the AF FORM 898 or electronic form for scheduling TD systems and associate
   courses. The electronic form must be mutually agreed upon by host wing MTS and TD.
   Units who use an electronic product must ensure all areas identified on the AF FORM 898
   are included.
       3.2.3.1. This document, once approved, is a contract between the host wing and the
       AETC TD.
       3.2.3.2. The group commander is the final approval authority for all versions of the AF
       FORM 898.
Note: The MXG/CC may delegate to the MTS Chief.
   3.2.4. Upgrade Training Waivers. See comprehensive guidance for training waivers in Air
   Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
   Personnel (Officer And Enlisted).
   3.2.5. Maintenance Training Section coordinates training course control documents (CCD)
   dealing with explosive safety annually through the wing weapons safety office.
3.3. Training Records. As a minimum, training records will be kept on all personnel in
military rank of TSgt and below as well as any other personnel in upgrade training or retraining
(T-1). Additionally, documentation will be kept on all MSgts and above who perform
maintenance on aircraft, missiles and associated equipment regardless of rank. Consideration
should be given to tasks these people might be called upon to perform while deployed.
   3.3.1. MSgts and above need only be certified on the "hands on" tasks they may normally be
   expected to perform. This does not have to include career field core tasks or local upgrade
   requirements unless they will be doing these tasks. MIS (TBA) will be used to provide a
   record of qualification. In the event MIS (TBA) is not available or is temporarily
   unavailable, hardcopy AF 623, AF Form 623A and the CFETP may be used to record
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                           23


   training. Records will be transcribed to TBA within 15 days of restoration of TBA
   availability.
   3.3.2. There is no special requirement for development of a training record for individuals
   performing task certification only. ICBM maintenance organizations will follow training
   management requirements in AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures.
3.4. Core tasks. Core tasks, as identified in the specialty training standard (STS) portion of the
CFETP, designate minimum on-the-job training (OJT) requirements for skill-level upgrade in an
AFSC. MAJCOM Functional Managers, commanders, and supervisors may designate additional
critical tasks as required for UGT. When designated, certify these critical tasks using normal
core task certification procedures. As a minimum, certification on all AFCFM-directed core
tasks applicable to the specialty must be completed for skill level upgrade. Exemptions:
   3.4.1. Core tasks, which are not applicable to base assigned aircraft, missiles or equipment,
   are not required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for core task
   training).
   3.4.2. For units with more than one mission design (e.g., A-10, C-130) aircraft or missile
   system, upgrade trainees need only complete core tasks on a single MDS. MFMs, unit
   commanders, and or supervisors may require trainees to complete core task training on
   additional mission design aircraft or missile system, if desired. If some of these core tasks
   involve training in another unit on base, trainees must still complete all core tasks relevant to
   at least one mission design aircraft or missile system. These additional tasks will not be
   UGT requirements for the individual. All units are bound by the requirements in this
   instruction and will accommodate core task trainees from other units.
3.5. Third-Party Certification of Core Tasks. Current AFI36-2201 policy gives the AFCFM
the authority to designate those core tasks that require third-party certification. AF/A4L does not
require third-party certifications of core tasks in maintenance CFETPs 2AXXX, 2MXXX,
2PXXX, 2RXXX, 2WXXX except for 2A7X2. Maintenance tasks that are mission-critical or
have a definite potential for personnel injury or damage can be documented on the Special
Certification Roster (SCR) IAW AFI 21-101. Keep in mind, personnel will still have to be
trained on all core tasks IAW the specific CFETP prior to skill-level upgrade. In this case, the
trainer will fulfill the role of both trainer and certifier, and the trainee will still have to
demonstrate task proficiency to the go level before being signed off. (T-1).
   3.5.1. MAJCOMs, commanders, and workcenter supervisors still retain the option to
   designate critical tasks (core or non-core), not already tracked on the SCR, that require third-
   party certification. The goal is to delegate this authority to the lowest level. To designate a
   task as requiring third-party certification, annotate in the core task column on the master task
   plan (MTP) and individual training plan. If the task is not already designated as a core task,
   annotate at the appropriate location in the core task column.
3.6. Qualification Tasks. These are tasks additive to core tasks that are required to perform
assigned duties for a respective workcenter.
3.7. Local Tasks. These are tasks in addition to core and qualification tasks deemed appropriate
by local leadership.
 24                                                                   AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014


                                              Chapter 4

   MAINTENANCE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS)/TRAINING BUSINESS AREA
                             (TBA)

4.1. Introduction. Maintenance training is one of many IMDS and G081/Mobility Air Force
Logistics Command and Control (G081/MAF Log C2). legacy applications being transformed
into one of the Air Force approved MIS business areas. The proposed MIS design calls for six to
seven new business areas to support wing level maintenance processes. TBA satisfies one of
these processes. MIS will enhance training management production by automating information
contained in AF FORM 623 (paper-based) record and legacy applications. This will increase
readiness, and improve sustainability of Air Force weapon systems and equipment. Systems
currently approved for use in training management are IMDS and G081. These systems are
designed to facilitate training management for personnel in maintenance-related career fields.
MIS use is mandatory when available. The MTS and or UTM are the Points of contact (POC)
for functional administration of the MIS training component.
4.2. Purpose. The MIS TBA provides authorized users with ready access to training related
information currently maintained in many different places and not readily accessible to those
who need the information. TBA allows users to:
   4.2.1. Maintain configuration management of AFJQS, CFETP, and STS tasks.
   4.2.2. Maintain configuration management of ancillary and special training courses.
   4.2.3. Maintain workcenter MTLs and MTPs.
   4.2.4. Maintain individual training records (AF FORM 623).
   4.2.5. Manage and track individual CDC enrollments. (*)
   4.2.6. Manage and track individual training courses and tasks. (*)
   4.2.7. Schedule and manage classes and events. (*)
   4.2.8. Forecast training shortfalls. (*)
   4.2.9. Predict Unit Type Code (UTC) training qualifications and shortfalls.
Note: * Future capability, not fielded at time of publication.
4.3. Administration. At wing level, the MTS and or UTM are the POC for functional
administration of the MIS TBA. Users will submit trouble reports to UTM or MTS. The UTM
will evaluate each trouble report to determine if the problem is software-related or related to lack
of user knowledge/training. If the UTM cannot resolve the trouble report locally, he/she will
forward it to MTS for resolution. If the MTS cannot resolve the trouble report, it will be
forwarded to the MAJCOM for resolution. All trouble reports that the MAJCOMs cannot
resolve should be forwarded to the TBA Field Assistance Service (FAS). Additionally,
maintenance UTMs will conduct the AF Training Course using the MIS TBA (when available).

   for presentation to the CCB. The CCB will evaluate/approve/disapprove non-critical change
   requests annually in conjunction with applicable U&TW and MATAG. (T-2).
      4.9.1.1. Master Course Code Approval Process. Course additions, changes, and
      deletions identified as non-critical but time sensitive/critical: All aircraft related course
      code changes will go thru the Aircraft Lead command for concurrence on how that
      requirement is to be tracked Air Force wide. Preformatted request letters must be
      completed for each new request and forwarded by the MTS to their                   MAJCOM
      representative for approval and submission to the MCT Manager. Immediate change
      requests of a critical nature may be routed for e-mail approval from the requesting
      MAJCOM POC, thru all other MAJCOM POCs to HQ AF/A4LF for immediate approval
      and processing. If approved, these requests will be sent to the AF MCT Manager for
      processing/implementation. (T-2).
      4.9.1.2. Master Course Code Waiver Process. AF/A4LF is the waiver authority for all
      local course codes to be used for local requirements tracking only. Local Requirements
      Tracking: Will be those requirements that only the submitting Unit/Base ID has as a valid
      training requirement that must, by directive, be tracked in an MIS. This valid training
      requirement must not be applicable to any other Unit/Base/MAJCOM in order to be
      exclusively tracked locally.     If a valid requirement does apply to any other
      Unit/Base/MAJCOM then the requirement, must be submitted as an MCT request for all
      users to have access to. Requests for waivers must be submitted through your MAJCOM
      Training manager to AF/A4LF with full justification as to why the Unit/Base ID requires
      more local course codes than the preset limit of 20 per base established by HQ AF/A4LF.
      If disapproved, AF/A4LF will return submission with justification for disapproval.

                     MAINTENANCE TRAINING SECTION (MTS)

5.1. General (Chapter not applicable to ARC units). The MTS is an MXG Staff agency
organized as a centralized aircraft maintenance training function. However, UTMs should be
physically located and conduct their daily duties in the unit(s) they support. All Maintenance
Instructors (MI) and UTMs (AFSC 3S2X1) will be assigned to the MTS under the MO for
administrative purposes. The centralization concept provides economy of scale and standardizes
maintenance training throughout the MXG. UTMs will manage one or more squadrons (if
necessary). The MTS consists of the Training Management Element and Development &
Instructor (D&I) Element.
NOTE: Organizations that do not have a Maintenance Training Section (MTS) will complete
skill training in the individual work centers (or Equivalent Training Function). (T-2).
   5.1.1. The MTS is responsible for the functional management, utilization, control, and
   training of assigned 3S2X1 personnel. This structure provides the best possible environment
   to ensure the MTS can fulfill their responsibilities, support all MXG customer needs, and
   effectively manage, utilize, train and mentor assigned 3S2X1 personnel to be productive and
   progress within their career field. The overall responsibility for management of the MTS
   rests with the MO OIC/Superintendent. (T-2).
   5.1.2. Performance-based activities (contractors and MEOs) will organize IAW AFI 38-203,
   and will implement the organization required IAW their contract or management plan.

   5.1.3. Coordinate with Plans, Scheduling & Documentation (PS&D) function and the
   production superintendent or MOO/SUPT for selecting training aircraft. The MTS will
   forward training requirements in a monthly format (including configuration and time periods)
   to Maintenance Operations PS&D by the end of the second week of each month for inclusion
   in the monthly maintenance schedule. (T-2) Training requirements must be updated weekly
   and forwarded to MO and Aircraft Maintenace Unit (AMU) PS&D for inclusion in the
   weekly maintenance plan. The MTS is responsible for scheduled maintenance training
   aircraft (in conjunction with the AMU) to include maintaining aircraft forms and
   coordinating on- and off-equipment maintenance. (T-2).
Note: UTMs assigned to support an Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) should be located
in the squadron, instead of AMU to ensure consistency across all AMUs.

                                    EN-ROUTE TRAINING

7.1. General. The En-route training program provides individuals with mission essential
training needed to meet the requirements of an assignment to short or long tour locations. En-
route training provides weapon system training to aircraft maintenance personnel assigned to
units with equipment or systems unfamiliar to the personnel in transition, or have not worked the
system/MDS for 3 years (free-flow personnel). Training may be provided en-route during
permanent change of station (PCS) via FTD, MQP/RTC, or flight line training. En-Route
training for long tour location is only authorized for tour lengths less than 3 years or if specific
courses are not available at that location (short tour locations will receive priority status over
long tour assignments).
NOTE: IAW AFI36-2110, Table 4.1. Rule 10, en-route training is not authorized during intra-
theater assignments. This chapter does not apply to ARC and ICBM Units.
7.2. Establishing New En-Route Training Requirements. Each year gaining units must
submit through the annual screening process an AF Form 3933, MAJCOM Mission Training
Request, through the MTS, to the parent MAJCOM to meet future en-route requirements.
7.3. Establishing Sequential En-Route Requirements. Each year, gaining units submit
requirements during the annual (data call) process. Submit requirements through the local MTS
to the MAJCOM Training Branch if applicable.
7.4. Factors to Consider When Scheduling En-Route Training. The Assignment Gains
Roster (or an automated product used to identify inbound personnel) is available from your local
Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or your unit.
   7.4.1. Initiate training requests at the beginning of the assignment cycle. Training requests
   initiated within 90 days of MPF return no later than date (RNLTD) are considered late.
   7.4.2. Supervisors will use the following factors as a minimum in determining a person’s
   qualifications (T-2):
       7.4.2.1. Training history, listed by three-digit Personnel Data System (PDS) code.
       (Translations for PDS codes are listed in Education and Training Course Announcements
       web page).
       7.4.2.2. Member’s duty history.
       7.4.2.3. SEI.
7.5. Canceling En-Route Training Request. When it is determined that an En-Route training
requirement no longer exists, the gaining MTS will notify the command functional training
manager and cancel the requirement. (T-2).
7.6. Scheduling En-route Training. En-route training will be scheduled based on the gaining
organization's need. All free-flow personnel should receive training on the new system/weapons
system prior to assuming their duties at the gaining location. This training can be in the form of
OJT, but if a TD course is available, the member must be scheduled to attend this course as soon
after arrival as possible. Personnel reporting to an OCONUS tour with a tour length of less than 3
 40                                                                   AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014


years will receive this training en-route. Personnel reporting to an OCONUS long tour (tour
lengths 3 years or more) or CONUS tour will receive this training at the gaining duty location. In
cases where the training is not available at the gaining long tour or CONUS location, personnel
should receive training en-route prior to arrival.
   7.6.1. Gaining MAJCOM responsibilities. (Note: Component MAJCOMs can choose to
   exercise reach-back for training requests to Lead MAJCOMs)
       7.6.1.1. Coordinates with subordinate units to determine/identify training requirements
       for inbound personnel.
       7.6.1.2. Works with AFPC to establish Personnel Processing Codes (PPC) code requiring
       en-route training for all maintenance positions at OCONUS locations for tour lengths less
       than 3 years.
       7.6.1.3. Identifies training requirements for inbound personnel and submits request to
       982 TRG/TXTGA no later than 120 days prior to RNLTD
   7.6.2. Gaining unit responsibilities.
       7.6.2.1. Identifies to its MAJCOM maintenance training office, training required for each
       individual gain. Gaining units will make this notification as soon as possible, but not later
       than 10 days after notification of the gain. The gaining unit will not request training
       outside an individual’s primary AFSC. (T-2).
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                         41


                                           Chapter 8

                 MAINTENANCE QUALIFICATION PROGRAM (MQP)

8.1. General (This chapter does not apply to ANG, and AFSOC units). Qualification
training is ongoing, providing adequate skills to accomplish all maintenance tasks required. Each
MAJCOM will develop and implement a MQP to achieve maintenance qualification training
IAW AFI 36-2201. MQP training should be conducted in a controlled environment that is not in
competition with sortie production. MTS, TD, and ADL courses can all be used to satisfy local
training requirements. All MAJCOM MQPs will incorporate a similar phased training process
that meets the intent of processes identified in this chapter. (T-2).
Note: Specific qualification requirements for munitions, nuclear and missile activities are
included in the appropriate AFI 21-2XX series instructions and MAJCOM supplements.
8.2. Phase I, Inprocessing, Mission Orientation and Maintenance Refresher.
   8.2.1. Inprocess to base, wing, squadron, and unit training/MTS.
   8.2.2. Mission Orientation: Personnel will attend orientation within 60 days after arrival. (T-
   3).
   8.2.3. Maintenance Refresher: This is recurring training conducted as a follow-up to the
   maintenance orientation (if applicable).
8.3. Phase II, Continuation Training (CT).
   8.3.1. Continuation training is a structured training phase that standardizes specific AFSC
   training requirements. It consists of four sub-phases (Multiphase, MAJCOM Mandatory,
   Freeflow, and Maintenance Qualification Training). It is designed to provide task oriented
   hands-on training. Phase II enhances and complements initial skills training by providing
   hands-on weapon system training and experience. It is designed to train personnel to
   perform maintenance tasks unsupervised and unassisted. Continuation training courses
   should provide a smooth learning transition while providing a logical building block
   approach for job qualification.
       8.3.1.1. Phase II training can be used to supplement OJT and to provide skill-level
       upgrade, qualification, CUT, or familiarization training. Phase II students are attached to
       the MTS and TD during training, but are officially assigned to their respective gaining
       organizations.
   8.3.2. Multiphase Students.
       8.3.2.1. The term “Multiphase” identifies students who must complete AETC resident
       training and a follow-on TD AFSC-awarding course. Students are automatically
       scheduled for the AFSC-awarding course by 982 TRG at Sheppard Air Force Base
       (AFB).
       8.3.2.2. Students arriving at their end assignment should in-process as much as possible
       before the class starts. Obtaining a line badge should be the first priority.
42                                                                AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014


     8.3.2.3. The squadron commander may allow Multiphased students to return to the
     organization following the normal TD training day. Students may be trained on tasks
     such as posting technical orders, support section functions, and other related items.
     8.3.2.4. Senior maintenance personnel will establish procedures to closely monitor these
     individuals. Constant supervision will be required since these personnel may not be
     sufficiently trained or aware of hazards associated with maintenance tasks. (T-2).
  8.3.3. MAJCOM Mandatory Courses:
     8.3.3.1. The MMCL will be used to determine mandatory aircraft maintenance courses
     (TD, IMI, ADL, MQTP etc). All entry level Airmen Basic through the grade of Master
     Sergeant (7-level), who perform maintenance in a sortie producing and backshop AFSCs,
     are required to attend mandatory courses as identified in the course listing. (T-2).
     8.3.3.2. The MTS and unit training manager will ensure personnel are scheduled to
     attend MMCL courses within 180 days (if course prerequisites are met) of assignment to
     squadron. If more than one course is required, the individual must begin each subsequent
     course within 180 days of completion of the previous course. When personnel cannot be
     immediately entered into a TD course, the unit should schedule them for in-processing
     appointments or ancillary training. Any exceptions to this paragraph will be noted in the
     MMCL.
     8.3.3.3. Phase I requirements will not interfere with students attending Phase II training
     courses. (T-3).
  8.3.4. Freeflow students:
     8.3.4.1. Freeflow training is for personnel who are changing MDSs or who have not
     performed maintenance duty on the assigned MDS within the past 3 years.
     8.3.4.2. Personnel who are changing from one weapon system to another will attend the
     appropriate MMCL and Maintenance Qualification Training (MQT) courses.
     8.3.4.3. All master sergeants and above with less than 1 year experience on the assigned
     MDS, who supervise maintenance personnel, will attend the appropriate TD
     familiarization course, if available.
     8.3.4.4. The MXG/CC may waive TD freeflow course requirements.
     8.3.4.5. Requests for waiver will be initiated by the squadron commander and forwarded
     to the MTS. The MTS Chief will forward recommendations to the MXG/CC for
     approval/disapproval. Waiver requests will contain individual’s name, rank, primary
     AFSC, duty position, course to be waived, and a full justification of the request.
     8.3.4.6. When a waiver is approved, the MTS scheduler will file a copy of the letter and
     forward the original to the squadron through the UTM. The UTM will update the
     individual’s automated training record in IMDS/G081, using course status code "W”.
  8.3.5. MQT. MQT consists of academic and practical hands-on training courses that
  compliment AETC TD courses. MQT courses will not duplicate any 3c-level tasks that are
  taught by AETC or which requires the student to perform to a certified level (i.e., without
  error, without assistance, 80-100 percent accuracy, etc.).
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                     43


       8.3.5.1. MQT students are attached to the MTS for training, but are assigned to their
       gaining organization. Students will complete all 3c task items from the course control
       documents at least once. MQT students will not be sent to the flightline until they are
       qualified on required tasks. Students who fail to achieve course objectives may be
       required to repeat all or part of the course. The squadron commander may remove a
       student from the MQT program for unsatisfactory progress. This individual will receive
       supervised OJT in their work center.
       8.3.5.2. The MTS will assess the need for MQT courses. If needed, a formal training
       program should be developed and implemented that teaches differences between assigned
       aircraft and training aircraft.
8.4. Phase III, Special Qualification Training (SQT).
   8.4.1. SQT is any training program that does not fall under any other phase of MQP.
   8.4.2. SQT programs may apply to all personnel in a workcenter or only to those personnel
   assigned to a special duty. Examples of SQT courses are listed below:
       8.4.2.1. Engine Run Training Program.
       8.4.2.2. Test Cell Operation.
       8.4.2.3. Forms Documentation.
       8.4.2.4. Dedicated Crew Chief Program.
       8.4.2.5. Crash Recovery Training.
       8.4.2.6. Hot Refueling Training.
       8.4.2.7. Borescope Training.
       8.4.2.8. Chafing Awareness Training Program.
       8.4.2.9. MIS Training.
       8.4.2.10. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Operator Training Program.
       8.4.2.11. Engine Blade Blending Training and Certification.
       8.4.2.12. MAJCOM Mandatory Courses.
       8.4.2.13. Maintenance Officer Training Program, if taught by the MTS.
       8.4.2.14. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Self-Aid Buddy Care, if taught in
       the MTS.
   8.4.3. SQT will not duplicate AETC training available locally.
 44                                                                     AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014

         The SCs should be completed sequentially, beginning with General (02AF1). The
         course material can be viewed, printed, or saved to a personal computer. It is
         recommended the technician print a copy to make notes and answer the self-test
         questions.
         9.1.5.4.2. To access the A&P SCs:
 46                                                                   AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014

               list provided.
               9.1.5.4.2.3. Click the SC to open enrollment in the course. 9.1.5.4.3. Each SC
               consists of a series of Units and Unit Review Exercises (URE). Each SC must be
               completed with a minimum passing score of 70%.
               9.1.5.4.3.1. A trainer/certifier will proctor the URE exams. (T-2).
               9.1.5.4.3.2. The proctor must ensure that all course material, notes and other
               compromising materials are removed from vicinity of exam location. (T-2).
               9.1.5.4.3.3. The proctor must annotate their information on each line of the URE
               Exam Proctor Log contained within the CG-G-EAE-3 Form. (T-2).
           9.1.5.4.4. A course completion certificate may be printed upon completion of all
           UREs with a passing score of 70%. The course completion certificate is located at
           “My Transcript”.
Note: Technicians who possess a single FAA mechanic certificate rating (Airframe or
Powerplant), and are participating in this program to pursue an additional rating, are not required
to complete General (02AF1) and the SC applicable to the rating previously awarded. Example:
technicians who possess the FAA Powerplant certification are not required to complete General
(02AF1) and Powerplant (02AF3). The only SC required to complete is Airframe (02AF2).
       9.1.5.5. The technician must complete all required OJT items specified in the QTP. All
       open OJT items are mandatory and must be completed. The QTP instructions identify
       required OJT items and provide training instructions and procedures for task sign-off.
       9.1.5.6. After the technician completes all QTP requirements, the unit maintenance
       officer (MO) must review the QTP to verify the technician completed all program
       training and experience requirements and signs the verification portion of the CG-G-
       EAE-2 Form, and CG-G-EAE-3 Form. The MO is verifying the technician has completed
       all program training and experience requirements within the QTP by conducting a final
       unit-level review of completed documents. The MO is not certifying task
       qualification/proficiency. The Trainer/Certifier is responsible for performing the training
       and ensuring the technician meets the appropriate task qualification/proficiency levels.
       9.1.5.7. After MO review, the technician must provide CCAF a copy of completed QTP
       (CG-G-EAE-2 Form, CG-G-EAE-3 Form and Air University Online SC completion
       certificates). The documents may be scanned and E-mailed to ccaf.faa@us.af.mil or
       mailed to: CCAF/DEAL, 100 South Turner Blvd, Maxwell-Gunter AFB, AL 36114-
       3011.

       requirements are met, the Program Director will issue the technician a CG-G-EAE-4
       Form, Certificate of Eligibility, and FAA Form 8610-2, Airman Certificate and/or Rating
       Application.
       9.1.5.9. Upon receipt of the graduation documents from CCAF, the technician schedules
       an appointment with their local FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)
AFI36-2650 20 MAY 2014                                                                      47


       Airworthiness Safety Inspector (ASI). The technician must present the CG-G-EAE-4
       Form, completed CG-G-EAE-2 Form, military ID and FAA Form 8610-2 to the ASI.
       The ASI will review the documents and sign the FAA Form 8610-2, granting the
       technician authorization to take the FAA exams. FAA certification consists of a dual
       examination process: three knowledge exams and oral and practical exams.
          9.1.5.9.1. Each SC has practice exams to help technicians prepare for the FAA A&P
          certification exams. Only technicians who graduated from the program are authorized
          access to the practice exams. CCAF will authorize access upon program graduation.
          9.1.5.9.2. Upon receipt of the Certificate of Eligibility, log on to Air University
          Online and go to the “Course List” and search for the applicable practice exam and

       contact the Base Education Services Flight to determine if it is an approved FAA Testing
       Center.
          9.1.5.10.1. If the Base Education Services Flight is an approved FAA Testing
          Center, a test date may be scheduled. The three FAA knowledge exams (General,
          Airframe and Powerplant) are administered separately and at no cost to the
          technician.
          9.1.5.10.2. If the Base Education Services Flight is not an approved FAA Testing
          Center,     access    the     Airmen     Knowledge       Testing     Center     List
          http://faa.gov/training_testing/testing/media/test_centers.pdf to locate the nearest
          FAA Testing Center. The technician is responsible for the exam fees at these
          locations.
          9.1.5.10.3. When reporting for testing, the technician must provide the testing
          administrator the signed FAA Form 8610-2 and military ID. A 70% is needed to pass
