       6.1.1. General officer or equivalent: DV-6 through DV-3 (To convert DV codes to general

7. Precedence is based on grade and position.
   7.1. For general officers, precedence is determined by relative rank. A general officer’s rank should
   be available from his/her office.
   7.2. Order of precedence is as followed:
8                                                                   TRAVISAFBI36-109 3 MAY 2005


       7.2.1. Active duty four stars (by relative rank), retired four-stars, active three-stars, retired
       three-stars, active two-stars, etc.
       7.2.2. When position held is not a factor, precedence among Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine
       officers on active duty, including retired officers on active duty, is determined by date of rank.
       When the dates of rank are the same, precedence is determined by total active federal military ser-
       vice date. When the date of rank and total active federal military service date are the same, offic-
       ers of the regular Air Force take precedence among themselves according to their position on the
       permanent promotion list.
       7.2.3. Active duty officers precede reserve officers of the same rank. Retired officers rank with,
       but after, active duty Reserve officers of the same rank.
       7.2.4. At wing level, the commander and vice commander take precedence over other colonels in
       the wing, even though the other colonels may be senior by date of rank.
       7.2.5. At dual wing bases, the host commander should take precedence.
       7.2.6. Order of precedence for other wing colonels should be done by date of rank.
       7.2.7. Precedence of spouses is based upon their military member’s rank or position.
       7.2.8. Senior Executive Service (SES) precedence is determined by position held. SES pay does
       not affect precedence. If not otherwise in a higher ranking position, the following generally
       applies: SES-6 rank just after generals, SES-5s just after lieutenant generals, SES-4s and 3s just
       after major generals, and SES-2s and 1s just after brigadier generals.
NOTE: Precedence is subject to frequent changes based on the establishment of new positions, retire-
ments of incumbent members, or the direction of those in charge.

8. Precedence at Official Functions.
    8.1. Dinners, i.e., ALS graduations, SNCO inductions, farewells. Host of the dinner or honoree, guest
    speaker (regardless of rank), civic leaders/general officers, wing commanders, tenant commanders,
    vice commanders, group commanders, command chiefs. Spouses will always be announced with
    their husband or in their husband’s position when they are not able to attend.
    8.2. Change of command ceremonies: the presiding officer, outgoing and incoming commander (also
    referred to as the official party) followed by the special guests of the official party (family and
    friends), civic leaders, commanders (spouses included), group commanders (spouses included), and
    command chiefs (spouses included).
    8.3. Retirements, promotions: Official party (presiding officer and honoree to include family), spe-
