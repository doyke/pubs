This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities, and establishes
procedures and priorities for sweeping the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER) airdrome.
This instruction applies to all organizations and individuals operating on, or adjacent to, the
JBER airdrome. The base civil engineer is responsible for the overall sweeping effort as
coordinated with Airfield Management. Compliance with this instruction cannot be waived. It
does not apply to the US Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard unit and members. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the office of primary
responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
Route the AF Form 847 through the appropriate chain of command. Ensure all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). See
Attachment 1 for Glossary of References and Supporting Information.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.                Updated
instruction was mandated by airdrome changes and joint basing.
1. Responsibilities:
   1.1. Organizations using areas on the airfield for aircraft parking, maintenance, and loading
   will continually police and hand sweep areas clean of small amounts of foreign object
   damage (FOD) causing material, as necessary.
 2                                                          673ABWI32-1004 20 MARCH 2013


     1.2. All personnel operating vehicles on the airfield will remove any FOD materials
     observed on the airfield and place them in the FOD containers carried in each vehicle and at
     the designated FOD collection points.
     1.3. The 3rd Wing FOD Monitor will ensure FOD collection containers are located at each
     of the primary access points (gates 1, 11, 12, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 32, 33) on the airfield.
     1.4. Airfield Management (3 OSS/OSAM) will inspect the airfield daily and coordinate
     sweeper requests through 773 CES/CEOH.
     1.5. Hardstands, trim pads, and test stands will be swept by 773 CES/CEOH personnel only
     when the areas are free of ground equipment. Only the nose position of the trim pad will be
     swept when tie-down cables are in place. To ensure regular sweeping, these areas MUST be
     cleared by using organizations.
     1.6. Magnetic sweeping operations will be accomplished twice monthly by 773 CES/CEOH.
     The magnetic sweeper will be available daily. 773 CES/CEOH will respond to 3
     OSS/OSAM’s requests for magnetic sweeping operations.
2. Standards and Techniques. Runways, taxiways, and parking aprons are considered
satisfactory for use when free of all gravel, sand, and other foreign materials.
     2.1. The 773 CES/CEOH will sweep all areas listed in this instruction, paragraph 3, or as
     directed by 3 OSS/OSAM.
     2.2. The 3 OSS/OSAM will, on a daily basis, request sweeping in any airdrome area that is
     unsatisfactory.
     2.3. All requests for unscheduled emergency sweeping will be processed through 3
     OSS/OSAM. The requesting organization will ensure areas are clear of all ground
     equipment.
3. Priority List. Approach of active runway, the expected taxi routes, aircraft parking areas will
maintain highest priority. Further explanation of each area and its priority are listed below.
NOTE: Sweeper crews WILL consult with 3 OSS/OSAM before the start of sweeping
operations to confirm taxiways and the departure runway. See Geobase interactive base map for
diagram of priority areas.
     3.1. Priority 1 Areas. Runway 06/24, Combat Alert Cell (CAC), Taxiways Foxtrot, Red
     ramp, Tango, Elbow, Fighter Parking Areas (including RED FLAG Areas), Romeo,
     Uniform, Fighter Town, November and Interlinks, Alpha South, West ramp hot pits, Delta
     East ramp hot pits and flight line entry points.
     3.2. Priority 2 Areas. Runway 16/34, South Loop, Taxiways Echo, Juliet, Mike, Bravo,
     Kilo, Papa, Alpha North, North ramp, C-17 and C-130 ramps, West ramp parking, Ops ramp,
     trim pads, munitions routes, and flight line road.
     3.3. Priority 3 Areas. All runway overruns/underruns, Charlie Loop, hardstands and all
     other areas. Bryant Army Airfield will be swept after winter break-up and upon request
     thereafter for the remainder of the summer season.
     3.4. Sweeper crews WILL consult with 3 OSS/OSAM at the beginning of each day to
     determine any unscheduled requests as the mission dictates (that is, active runway changes
673ABWI32-1004 20 MARCH 2013                                                              3


   and alternate taxi routes due to construction and closures). The 3 OSS/OSAM, as delegated
   by 3 OG/CC, may change airfield priority sequence as the mission dictates.
4. Summer Hours. During summer months, operation hours of sweeping are as follows:
   4.1. Day Shift. 0500-1400.
   4.2. Swing Shift. 1400-2300.
   4.3. Stand-By. 2300-0500.
