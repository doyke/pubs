2                                                                    AVIANOABI21-201 2 JULY 2007


1. GENERAL.
    1.1. The Munitions Flight will strictly control munitions delivered to the flightline; maintain account-
    ability, lot number integrity, enforce compliance of this publication and document transfer of muni-
    tions to ensure a positive chain of custody and accountability.
    1.2. The Munitions Flight Commander/Chief serves as the focal point for resolution of any munitions
    issues not defined within this publication.
    1.3. Munitions will not be moved on the flightline without prior coordination with the Munitions
    Expediter or Munitions Control.
       1.3.1. General support (equipment delivery, preparation to deliver munitions and trailer position-
       ing) for the next days sorties may continue as long as there is no transfer of munitions prior to
       Combat Ammunition System (CAS) reconciliation.
    1.4. To ensure strict accountability and preclude munitions departing Aviano AB not current in main-
    tenance, munitions flown off station must be approved prior to departure by the Munitions Account-
    able Systems Officer (MASO) or Flight Commander/Chief.
    1.5. Munitions Flight personnel involved in the transfer of munitions between the Munitions Flight,
    31 FW or deployed units, will ensure transfers are properly documented.
       1.5.1. Document munitions transactions on the AF IMT 4331, Munitions Transaction Sheet or AF
       IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
    1.6. Damaged/dropped munitions or equipment will be reported immediately to Munitions Control.
    Munitions Control will initiate an incident/accident report checklist. Items will not be moved until
    released by Munitions Control. The individual identifying the discrepancy will complete an AFTO
    Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag. [NOTE: Munitions assets identified with flightline dis-
    crepancies must be tested/troubleshot on two different stations or two different aircraft before Muni-
    tions Flight acceptance. The only exception will be chaff and flare mods which will be returned after
    the first recorded discrepancy.]
       1.6.1. When items are lost, local directives concerning lost or dropped-object reporting proce-
       dures will be followed. Munitions Control will be notified of lost and dropped-object reports
       involving munitions and will coordinate notification IAW applicable emergency action checklists.
       A copy of the reports will be forwarded to appropriate agencies.
    1.7. AFI 21-201 requires semiannual and/or 100% change of MASO inventories. A 100% munitions
    download of aircraft may be necessary during these events to ensure an accurate hands-on physical
    count. Exception, 20mm ammunition loaded in aircraft gun systems must be downloaded. Munitions
    Control will serve as the focal point for coordinating downloads with the Wing Weapons Manager and
    AMU Weapons Expediters at least 2 weeks prior to inventory date.
    1.8. Munitions Requirements.
       1.8.1. Munitions requirements will be supported only from signed wing flying schedules and
       properly coordinated AF IMT 2407s, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination. To ensure
       availability of requested munitions, it is paramount that a draft flying schedule be published at
       least two weeks prior to the affected date in the Patriot Excalibur System (PECS) or the Monthly
       Flying and Maintenance Plan. For further information and clarification, reference AFI 21-101 and
       USAFEI 21-165, Aircraft Flying and Maintenance Scheduling Procedures.
AVIANOABI21-201 2 JULY 2007                                                                             3


         1.8.1.1. Weapons expediters/OSK will notify Munitions Control of any changes to forecasted
         live, training or inert munitions requirements as soon as the change is identified.
         1.8.1.2. Ensure PECS inputs provide types, quantities, special munitions instructions required
         (e.g., fuzing, time settings, delays, fin type, etc.), as well as information on TER and MAU-12
         parent station load requirements to support the request.
         1.8.1.3. Spare aircraft will not be supported unless they are accurately loaded in PECS and
         identified in the flying schedule with valid Standard Configuration Loads (SCL).
         [NOTE: Failure to properly schedule spare aircraft with munitions requirements will nega-
         tively impact the Munitions Flight’s ability to support these unscheduled requests.]
         1.8.1.4. All 20mm will be scheduled in the following configurations unless prior approval has
         been coordinated. The munitions flight will only deliver 20mm ammunition identified as a
         “Hot Gun” requirement in the signed weekly wing schedule; i.e., ammunition scheduled to be
         shot. Load internal gun systems with the following amounts of ammunition by type of aircraft,
         unless unique operational requirements or situations arise. All 20mm will be delivered and
         loaded in the following configurations, partial loads of 20mm are strictly forbidden unless
         prior approval has been coordinated through the Wing Weapons Officer, Ops Group/CC, Wing
         Weapons Manager and Munitions Flight Supervision.

     the information. Discrepancies discovered during reconciliation will be resolved by the Munitions
     and Weapons Expediters. Recounts will be performed to determine if the disparity is a reporting,
     documentation or inventory error.
         3.2.3.1. "Pen and ink" corrections made to the AF IMT 2434 will be initialed by the Weapons
         Expediter. These changes are acceptable provided changes are legible and accurate.
         3.2.3.2. If reconciliation discrepancies still cannot be resolved, Munitions Control will notify
         Munitions Flight Supervision for approval to release munitions.
         3.2.3.3. Munitions Control will ensure pertinent information regarding the discrepancy is
         annotated in the events log and copies of reconciliation documents, sheets and logs are pro-
         vided to the Munitions Flight Supervision for evaluation the next duty day.
6                                                                     AVIANOABI21-201 2 JULY 2007


           3.2.3.4. If a reconciliation discrepancy is due to a lost or foreign object report, munitions will
           be released when a properly documented CAF IMT 145 is provided to Munitions Control for
           the item in question.
       3.2.4. If no discrepancies exist, the Munitions Expediter will provide Munitions Control a signed
       (or electronically signed) copy of the AF IMT 2434 and applicable supporting documentation
       after completion for CAS validation.
       3.2.5. In the event of a hang fire the AF IMT 2434 will be annotated in the remarks block for that
       mission to reflect the expended cartridge (i.e. hung bomb, etc.).
       3.2.6. Weapons Expediters will complete a separate AF IMT 2434 for training, exercises and con-
       tingency missions.
       3.2.7. Munitions Line Delivery/Munitions Expediter will collect and deliver residue and safety
       gear identified in Attachment 2 to CMM for certification of expenditures.
