     1.3. In addition to inspections, if a defect is found that requires a repair against the following
     systems 11XXX primary structure and skin and 13XXX landing gear, the repair action must
     be reported in ICARR.
     1.4. All Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) and (ICARR) inputs will be submitted
     in a timely manner, 5 to 7 working days after completion of repair or inspection or upon
     return from a TDY location where there is no access to transmitting to Automated Inspection,
     Repair, Corrosion & Aircraft Tracking (AIRCAT).
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The maintenance project officer or non-commissioned officer (NCO) will reside in the
