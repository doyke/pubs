     7.3. Headings. Nomination must describe specific accomplishments using bullet statements
     under the three headings listed below. Headings will be in bold print using all capitals
     without further enhancements. Do not include bullet statements on heading lines. Ensure
     statements contain what was done, how it was done and what effect it had. Show time
     references such as starting and/or ending dates. Accomplishments must be within the award
     timeframe to be creditable.
        7.3.1. LEADERSHIP AND JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY. Describe
        significant leadership accomplishments and how well the member performed assigned
        primary and additional duties. Define the scope and level of responsibilities and the
        impact on the mission and unit. Include any new initiatives or techniques developed by
        the member that positively impact the unit and/or mission. Include results of Air Force,
        MAJCOM, numbered air force-level inspections and/or evaluations.
        7.3.2. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT. Show how the member developed or
        improved skills related to primary duties; e.g., formal training, on-the-job training, Office
        of Personnel Management courses, local training courses offered by the Civilian

     support to the nomination. Provide full expansion of acronyms the first time they appear,
     except those common to all (e.g., DoD, AF, AETC, TRW, MSG, MSS). Substitute
     simplified terms for specialized terminology. Avoid the overuse of exclamation marks;
     generally, no more than two per nomination. Endeavor to submit properly formatted

     detract from the performance, contributions and achievements of the nominee.

     and Civilian of the Year awards. The commanders of the 17th Training Group, the 517th
     Training Group, the 17th Mission Support Group and the 17th Medical Group (or, in their
     absence, their designees) serve as selection committee members.
     8.2. A member from 17 FSS/FSMC coordinates the process.

     committee member to review and rate.
GOODFELLOWAFBI36-1001 15 AUGUST 2012                                                            5


   9.2. Members rate nominations according to the following criteria on rating sheets provided
   with each package.
      9.2.1. The maximum score is 30 points (whole points only, no fractions) based on the
      whole-person concept and the descriptions of the headings.
   9.3. Committee members should endeavor to score nominations in a manner that
   differentiates among the nominations; however, no particular point or placement system is
   designated. Committee members must consistently apply their own personal standards to all
   nominations to produce fair and equitable scores.
   9.4. Committee members submit their completed rating sheets and return them to the
   committee chair.
      9.4.1. The chairperson will verify and tally the ratings to determine the winners.
      9.4.2. In the event of a tie, the scores will be converted to placements (first, second,
      third, or fourth). Equal scores given by the same committee member will be placed
      equally (i.e., first, first, third, fourth). The nomination with the best placements (lowest
      total value) will become the winner. If this process cannot break the tie, the tied
      nominations will be returned to the members to be reviewed and rated again.
   9.5. The committee chairperson forwards the results to 17 FSS/FSMC where a memorandum
   (including the list of wing-, group-, and squadron-level winners) is prepared for the 17th
   Training Wing Commanderâ€™s approval and endorsement of the winning nominees and time-
   off award authorization.
10. Announcement of Winners.
   10.1. Civilians of the Quarter are announced at the quarterly awards function. Civilians of
   the Year are announced at the annual awards function. Other functions or methods deemed
   appropriate may also be used to announce or publicize the winners.
   10.2. 17 FSS/FSMC provides the names and organizations of the nominees and winners in
   all categories to the organizers of the luncheon/banquet for publication in the program and
   inclusion in the script.
11. Award Recognition.
   11.1. Civilians of the Quarter and Civilians of the Year receive plaques (or similar items)
   from the Goodfellow Top Three Council or the Goodfellow First Sergeants Council at the
   quarterly awards function or annual banquet. Civilians of the Year may also receive other
   gifts or mementos as deemed appropriate.
   11.2. Endorsement of the winning nominees by the Wing Commander authorizes 17
   FSS/FSMC to process personnel actions for Individual Time-Off Awards as follows.
      11.2.1. Wing-level Civilians of the Quarter receive 24 hours. Wing-level Civilians of the
      Year receive 32 hours.
      11.2.2. Group-level Civilians of the Quarter who do not win at the Wing level receive 16
      hours. Group-level Civilians of the Year who do not win at the Wing level receive 24
      hours.

    11.2.3. Squadron-level nominees who did not win at the group level receive 8 hours in
    quarterly and annual award competitions. To be eligible for a time-off award, a
    squadron-level nomination must be forwarded to the group or wing staff and compete (or
    otherwise be considered) at that level. Squadron-level winners "in name only" will not
    be awarded time off under this program.
