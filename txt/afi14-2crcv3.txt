                         EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

4.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: The operational portion of EIT and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). FPIT will be coordinated with force protection (FP)
organizations (e.g., Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)) as
defined in AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection (FP). (T-2)
   4.1.1. EIT is provided to the units’ assigned and attached crew, and will be coordinated with
   the wing/group tactics flight or officer as appropriate. (T-3)
   4.1.2. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other
   FP support agencies (e.g., AFOSI, Civil Engineering). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-
   119 and supporting documents. When possible, a FP Intelligence Formal Training Unit
   graduate will be responsible for the management of FPIT. If the intelligence function is not
   part of the host unit, tenant unit responsibilities in AFI 14-119 will apply. (T-3)
   4.1.3. Effective training methods will be used and can include, but are not limited to
   briefings, demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic training
   sessions. (T-3)
   4.1.4. Training resources can include, but are not limited to threat briefings, current
   intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
   materials, and weapons system videos. (T-3)
   4.1.5. Only qualified trainers will conduct unsupervised EIT. AFI 14-2CRC, Volumes 1 and
   2 identify specialized training requirements and evaluation criteria for EIT trainers. (T-2)
   4.1.6. Develop intelligence training for other base/unit personnel, if appropriate. (T-3)
4.2. External Intelligence Training.
   4.2.1. Build an EIT program, including training plans, tailored to the unit’s mission,
   weapons systems, projected wartime/Air and Space Expeditionary Force tasking and
   base/deployment location(s) with input from squadrons, tactics representatives, and SERE
   specialists, as appropriate. (T-2)
   4.2.2. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
   guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
   training, as well as any agency for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly
   scheduled basis.
   4.2.3. Ensure development of intelligence training for other base/unit personnel, if
   appropriate.
   4.2.4. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training cycle.
   (T-3)
   4.2.5. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
   requirements. (T-3)
   4.2.6. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned and
   apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
 12                                                        AFI14-2CRCV3 5 NOVEMBER 2014


   4.2.7. Provide a written evaluation of the EIT program to the appropriate commander(s) at
   the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a minimum the percent
   or number of personnel trained, trend analysis (e.g., high miss questions, weak areas), and
   corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable.
      4.2.8. The EIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Teach
      each item in the EIT training plan at least once during the training cycle. Evaluate the
      objectives for each EIT category with a test (85 percent minimum to pass). (T-3)
      4.2.9. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW the appropriate AFI
      13-1CRC, Volume 3, Operations Procedures - Control and Reporting Center (CRC). Outline
      the details of the prorating schedule in the EIT Plan and/or other written instructions. (T-3)
      4.2.10. EIT categories include threat knowledge, collection and reporting (C&R), and PR.
      Include other categories based on the unit’s mission, as required. (T-2)
         4.2.10.1. Threat Knowledge. Develop specific threat knowledge training objectives
         tailored to the unit mission, local area, deployment base(s) and forward operating
         locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit
         involvement. Refer to Attachment 3 for threat briefing standards. References listed in
         this instruction can be supplemented with other classified and unclassified publications
         (e.g., National Air and Space Intelligence Center products, Tactics Bulletins, Tactics
         Analysis Reports, Country Studies) when developing threat knowledge training materials.
         Ensure AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide is the primary reference for threat knowledge training
         and ensure training is current with the latest edition. Ensure AFTTP 3-1.CRC is the
         primary reference for CRC tactics and ensure training is current with the latest edition.
         4.2.10.2. C&R. C&R training will focus on items necessary to familiarize the mission
         crew with the information requirements of the intelligence-generated INTREP, INTSUM,
         story boards, and Joint Spectrum Interference Resolution (JSIR) intelligence reports. A
         critical component of C&R training will be the unit’s essential elements of information
         (EEI). Training will identify and describe theater-specific and peacetime reporting
         requirements. Ensure training identifies and describes both theater-specific reporting
         requirements and peacetime MAJCOM reporting requirements including applicable
         elements of intelligence reports (e.g., story boards, SITREP, JSIR, INTREP, INTSUM
         etc.).
         4.2.10.3. Personnel Recovery. When assigned, a SERE specialist will conduct PR
         operational support training. The SERE specialist will coordinate PR operations support
         training requirements with intelligence and document these requirements in a MOA.
         Units without SERE personnel will coordinate a MOA with operations. This category
         will be omitted if intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational support
         training to mission crew. If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support
         training, address as a minimum: PR materials ISOPREP maintenance and review and
         theater combat recovery procedures.
4.3. FPIT.
      4.3.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from SF
      personnel, AFOSI, and FP support agencies, as appropriate. (T-2)
AFI14-2CRCV3 5 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                13


  4.3.2. The FPIT plan will ensure FPIT is conducted IAW AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support
  to Force Protection and will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission FP requirements.
  Each item in the FPIT training plan will be taught IAW the FP customers’ objectives. (T-2)
  4.3.3. FPIT categories include intelligence roles and responsibilities, AOR hotspots, hostile
  forces, ground threat, landmines and improvised explosive devices. Include other categories
  based on the unit’s mission as required. FPIT will meet the standards found in Attachment 4.
  (T-3)
     4.3.3.1. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
     requirements. (T-3)
     4.3.3.2. Provide a feedback of the FPIT program to the appropriate commander(s) at the
     end of each training cycle. (T-3)

 Most common topics not completed:                              PR

2. In accordance with the EIT Plan, each mission crew member is required to be trained
on each training item at least once each training cycle. At the completion of the annual
training cycle, the following mission crew have not completed the annotated training items:

 Name                                             Intelligence Training Item
 John A. Doe                                      IEDs
 Susan L. Smith                                   SA-6, RPGs
 Zane G. Thomas                                   SA-2/3/8, PR
 Ed. D. Tyler                                     PR, ISOPREP

3. The annual Intelligence MQF test was administered on [DATE]. All CMR mission crew
members have taken the 100 question test (50 questions and 50 visual recognition slides). While
not all members obtained the minimum passing score of 85 percent the first time around, all tests
have been corrected to 100 percent. A total of 25 members took the test. The initial average test
score for the squadron was 95 percent.

4. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and IEDs
respectively. Greater emphasis will be placed on these threat systems during the next training
cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times each question was
missed.

           FORCE PROTECTION INTELLIGENCE TRAINING STANDARDS

A4.1. Force Protection Intelligence Training. Intelligence training for SF and other FP
support agencies must be focused on two primary educational goals: (1) roles, missions and
responsibilities of intelligence; (2) threat identification and capabilities.
A4.2. Minimum Requirements. The following requirements for FPIT provide a baseline of
important items that will be tailored for each unit’s specific mission, as required. FPIT should be
provided to SF and other support agencies to meet AFI 14-119 requirements. Units can add
items to this list.
