                CORROSION PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM

1.1. General. A definite interrelationship exists between preventing and controlling corrosion
on aerospace equipment. Corrosion will decrease with an increase in corrosion prevention. At
field level, the best and most economical means of corrosion prevention is frequent cleaning in
conjunction with periodic maintenance, painting (touch-up), and corrosion inspections.
Prevention is the hub to an effective corrosion control program; therefore, strict adherence to
corrosion prevention policies is essential. United States Air Force (USAF) technical instructions
for corrosion prevention, detection, treatment, and protection furnish general guidance
concerning application of the AFSOC corrosion prevention and control program. The applicable
USAF or manufacturer weapons system equipment manual will include inspection frequencies
and maintenance requirements of specific weapons systems and equipment. There is no
authorization to deviate from the requirements of this instruction without prior approval of
Headquarters (HQ) AFSOC/A4M. Crossflow of information is essential to the program. This
instruction authorizes all program managers’ direct communications with their counterparts (all
echelons) on any matter pertaining to the program.
1.2. MAJCOM Program Management Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. HQ AFSOC/A4MSS is assigned Corrosion Control Manager responsibilities. In
     addition to the responsibilities outlined in AFI 20-114, Air and Space Equipment
     Management, the AFSOC corrosion manager will:
     1.2.2. Review Air Force publications concerning corrosion prevention and control for
     adequacy and coordination with appropriate agencies.
     1.2.3. Submit comments and recommendations based on experience to agencies responsible
     for the concept, definition, and acquisition of Air Force materiel.
     1.2.4. Coordinate with Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) on the development and
     testing of corrosion control techniques and materiel.
     1.2.5. Communicate with Air Education Training Command (AETC) on the corrosion
     training curriculum. HQ AFSOC/A4MMT will coordinate on all training matters that effect
     the AETC developed courses.
     1.2.6. Represent the command at the Corrosion Prevention Advisory Board (CPAB) for
     assigned weapons systems.
1.3. Wing/Group Corrosion Manager Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. The wing/group commander will designate a corrosion control manager. Submit in
     January of each year, if changed: name, functional address, office symbol, e-mail address,
     DSN, and FAX to HQ AFSOC/A4M. This manager will serve as the intermediate command
     focal point for the corrosion control program.
     1.3.2. Monitor subordinate units’ compliance with applicable provisions of 20-114, Air and
     Space Equipment Management, and this instruction.
AFSOCI21-102 24 MAY 2012                                                                        5


   1.3.3. Ensure units develop and issue technical and administrative instruction on the AFSOC
   corrosion control program (i.e., aircraft wash cards).
   1.3.4. Review base requirements for training, facilities, equipment, and materiel to support
   the corrosion program.
   1.3.5. Develop and submit to HQ AFSOC/A4MS comments and recommendations for
   improvement of the corrosion program as needed.
   1.3.6. Supplement AFSOC corrosion control directives, as required, to maintain a sound
   corrosion control program.
   1.3.7. Forecast and plan funding to attend the Corrosion Prevention Advisory Board (CPAB)
   for assigned weapons systems.
   1.3.8. Coordinate with each flying and maintenance squadron for CPAB action items and
   submit these items to HQ AFSOC/A4M when tasked.
1.4. Corrosion Prevention Advisory Board (CPAB).
   1.4.1. AFI 20-114, Air and Space Equipment Management,, authorizes a CPAB for all
   aircraft. The purpose of the CPAB is to investigate specific airframe corrosion-related
   problems, evaluate procedures, and make appropriate recommendations.
   1.4.2. Membership includes representatives from AFSOC, other MAJCOMs, individual Air
   Logistics Centers (ALCs), and SOF wing/groups.
   1.4.3. Although the CPAB is primarily advisory in nature, its findings and recommendations
   represent the consensus of the board members.
   1.4.4. The CPAB, with AFSOC notification, may make investigative visits to AFSOC units.
1.5. Cleaning and Washing of Aircraft.
   1.5.1. Maintenance Group (MXG), Special Operations Squadron (SOS), and Maintenance
   Squadron (MXS) commanders will establish and enforce procedures and controls to ensure
   accomplishment of exterior and interior aircraft cleaning cycles IAW T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft
   Weapons Systems Cleaning and Corrosion Control. AFSOC units located in severe
   corrosion environments or frequently operate low level flights over salt water must
   aggressively maintain a strict wash schedule for a sound corrosion prevention and control
   program. Units will provide by letter to HQ AFSOC/A4MS a history of assigned aircraft
   washes by 31 Jan for the previous year. At a minimum it will include aircraft tail number
   and dates (for the year) washed. This data will be used to assist in pinpointing recurring
   causes of corrosion. This report is designated emergency status code ―D‖ IAW AFI 33-324,
   The Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal
   Public, and Interagency Air Force Collections, paragraph 2.6.
   1.5.2. A complete exterior wash and interior cleaning will be accomplished prior to each
   isochronal or phase inspection.
   1.5.3. After each wash, lubricate the aircraft IAW the weapons system technical order.
   1.5.4. Units operating aircraft near or over salt water will develop local procedures to ensure
   that clear water rinse requirements in T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons Systems Cleaning and
 6                                                                AFSOCI21-102 24 MAY 2012


     Corrosion Control, are met. Units will provide a copy of their procedures to HQ
     AFSOC/A4M for use in cross talks and command-wide dissemination of ideas.
     1.5.5. All AFSOC aircraft stationed in severe corrosion environments will have a complete
     after wash corrosion inspection by structural maintenance personnel.
     1.5.6. All C-130 squadrons will ensure the urinal area of their aircraft is cleaned and
     inspected at each Basic Post Flight (BPO) and aircraft wash. This is a corrosion prone area
     requiring constant attention. Pay particular attention to corrosion prone areas identified in
     1C-130A-23, System Peculiar Corrosion Control USAF Series C-130A/B/D/E/H/N/P
     Aircraft, or 1C-130(E)J-23, Corrosion Prevention and Control Manual.
     1.5.7. Units eligible for wash interval waivers must submit waivers IAW T.O. 1-1-691,
     Aircraft Weapons Systems Cleaning and Corrosion Control, to HQ AFSOC/A4MS in
     conjunction with the System Program Director (SPD). The SPD has the final approval
     authority. HQ AFSOC/A4MS will forward a copy of the waiver to AFRL Robins AFB,
     AFRL/RXSSR. Waivers will expire one year after approval is granted. Each year a new
     waiver is required.
1.6. Contract Aircraft Cleaning Services.
     1.6.1. For organizations utilizing a performance contract: the MXG/CC or MXS/CC will
     establish local inspection requirements to ensure the provisions of the contract services are
     met. Use the customer complaint system (reference AFI 63-124, Performance Based Service
     Acquisition) to identify deficient services.
     1.6.2. Each contract is a binding agreement between the government and a contractor that
     requires compliance in its entirety. Under no circumstances will units change, reduce, or
     increase the provisions and work specifications of the contract without approval of the
     contracting officer. All statements of work will be reviewed and coordinated at base level
     and HQ AFSOC/A4M prior to award of contract.
     1.6.3. The MXG/CC or MXS/CC will appoint, in writing, quality assurance evaluator (QAE)
     personnel to monitor contractor performance IAW AFI 63-124, Performance Based, Service
     acquisition.
1.7. Prevention.
     1.7.1. All maintenance personnel, regardless of Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), are
     responsible for identifying corrosion. Upon discovery of corrosion discrepancies that may
     affect aircraft structural integrity, safety of flight or equipment serviceability beyond the
     using work center’s capability to correct, a structural maintenance (2A7X3) specialist will be
     dispatched to evaluate the discrepancy. Enter all discrepancies noted during these
     inspections in the maintenance forms and Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) or
     Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS).
     1.7.2. Aircraft avionics systems and instruments are extremely critical for safety of flight
     and are no less susceptible to corrosion than any other portion of the aircraft. All avionics
     work sections must be familiar with and have available for use, T. O. 1-1-689, Avionic
     Cleaning and Corrosion Prevention/Control. It is the responsibility of avionics maintenance
     personnel to inspect and clean the pins and sockets of disconnected electrical connectors,
     black boxes, LRUs, and inside equipment drawers, etc., for corrosion. When corrosion is
AFSOCI21-102 24 MAY 2012                                                                         7


   identified beyond the capability of the Avionics shop to correct, request assistance from the
   structural maintenance shop.
   1.7.3. It is not economical to treat minor hardware (screws, nuts, bolts, clamps, etc.) for
   corrosion. Replace any corroded minor hardware as soon as possible.
1.8. Corrosive Chemical Substance.
   1.8.1. A corrosive chemical spill aboard an aircraft is one of the most potentially hazardous
   situations encountered by maintenance and aircrew personnel.
   1.8.2. When a corrosive chemical leak or spill occurs aboard an AFSOC aircraft,
   immediately perform neutralization and clean up of the chemicals upon landing IAW
   AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. Each unit
   involved will annotate the debriefing check sheets to ensure prompt notification of the
   structural maintenance shop. Make entries on the aircraft’s forms as to what type of
   chemical spilled, area contaminated, specific neutralization procedures, and results of
   corrosion inspection. Expeditious chemical neutralization is essential to prevent structural
   damage. After neutralization, perform a comprehensive corrosion inspection of the affected
   area.
   1.8.3. Clean aircraft and equipment soiled with fire extinguishing materials as soon as
   possible after exposure.         Do not allow fire extinguishing residue, such as
   bromochoromethane (CB) or dibromodifloromethane extinguishing materials, to remain on
   the equipment for a period of four hours or more. T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons Systems
   Cleaning and Corrosion Control, contains specific agent removal procedures. If the aircraft
   or equipment is impounded as a result of an accident, the accident investigation board shall
   consider the rapid corrosive attack of the fire extinguishing material. They will release the
   aircraft for removal of this material at the earliest possible time consistent with the accident
   investigation. Prompt action in accomplishing this procedure can result in savings of
   considerable man-hours and materiel.
1.9. Protective Coatings.
   1.9.1. Application of quality coatings usually provides protection of aircraft and AGE
   surfaces. There are corrosion preventative compounds (CPC) and many types of inorganic
   coatings available to protect unpainted metals. Choice of the proper protective coatings
   depends upon technical order requirements, type of metal, available facilities, environmental
   conditions, and operating locations of the equipment. There are many more variables to take
   into consideration when choosing the proper coating; therefore, structural maintenance
   personnel must exercise sound judgment. Total repainting of aircraft is not authorized due to
   federal, state, and local environmental restrictions and lack of proper facilities. If corrosion
   treatment is beyond the work center’s capability request engineering assistance IAW T.O.
   00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance. For CV-22's, submit a technical assistance request
   (TAR) through Quality Assurance into the V-22 Tech Assist Management Program
   (VTAMP) IAW T.O. 00-25-107.
1.10. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE).
 8                                                                 AFSOCI21-102 24 MAY 2012


     1.10.1. AGE corrosion control is equally as important as aircraft corrosion control. AGE
     T.O.s and the applicable equipment T.O.s contain adequate guidance for an effective
     corrosion prevention and control program.
     1.10.2. AGE supervision will establish an aggressive corrosion control plan to ensure
     equipment is maintained to the highest standard. Schedule all corrosion repairs or repainting
     that is beyond the responsible work center’s capability with the Structural Maintenance
     Element.
     1.10.3. Apply markings IAW T.O. 35-1-3, Corrosion Prevention, Painting and Marking of
     USAF Support Equipment (SE). Markings may be applied in paint or vinyl.
     1.10.4. The use of sprayable corrosion preventive compounds (CPC) is encouraged.
1.11. Mobility Equipment.
     1.11.1. Mobility equipment that requires markings IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning
     and Execution, will have the mobility markings applied using color (flat black-37038) or
     (semi-gloss olive drab-24087). Markings may be applied in paint or vinyl.
1.12. Training.
     1.12.1. Units will provide all (2AXXX) aircraft maintenance personnel (excluding AFSC
     2A7X3, Aircraft Structural Maintenance, those performing administrative, supply, and
     manning duties) with corrosion training. Training frequency will consist of annual
     familiarization. Corrosion training will be documented in CAMS/IMDS.
     1.12.2. Training curriculum will include, but is not limited to:
        1.12.2.1. Corrosion identification procedures and techniques.
        1.12.2.2. Knowledge of aircraft and equipment corrosion susceptible areas.
        1.12.2.3. Reporting and documenting procedures for identified corrosion.
        1.12.2.4. Proper selection and use of sealant for corrosion prevention.
        1.12.2.5. Proper selection and use of corrosion preventive compounds.

   reconditioning.
   4.1.3. Units are encouraged to ensure that an adequate number of personnel are available to
   complete intricate interior cleaning and inspecting to ensure corrosion is detected and
   repaired.
   4.1.4. Units will maintain aircraft appearance with minimum loss of aircraft availability.
   4.1.5. All Group Commanders must ensure operators and maintainers share equal
   responsibility for the cleanliness, appearance, and serviceability of aircraft interiors. It is
   everyone’s responsibility to maintain the integrity of aircraft appearance.
