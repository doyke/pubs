The purpose of this Hill Air Force Base (AFB) instruction is to provide and define the process
for business development, as it relates to utilizing the center business office (CBO) (see
attachment 2). The CBO is the overall coordinating entity to customers and potential partners
wanting to conduct business at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), as it relates to depot
maintenance. The CBO will assist in identifying, and vetting new or expanded workloads within
the 309th Maintenance Wing (309 MXW). This instruction stipulates responsibilities for
identifying new systems, sub-systems, major modifications, or significant increases in existing
workloads that require facility modifications and/or additions, capital equipment, public-private
partnerships (PPP), new employee skills, or significantly increased personnel requirements.
Finally, this instruction delineates responsibilities for all 309 MXW organizations to follow, in
order to achieve maximum communication and efficiency in responding to new business
opportunities. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.             Refer recommended
