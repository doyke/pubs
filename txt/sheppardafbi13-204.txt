1.3. Runway Selection Procedures.
     1.3.1. During 80 FTW operations, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will determine the runway
     in use. The Control Tower Watch Supervisor will determine the runway in use when the
     80 FTW is not flying.
     1.3.2. Runway change procedures will be in accordance with (IAW) Attachment 7.
     Individual checklists will be derived from these procedures.
1.4. Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
     1.4.1. The CMA is defined as 100 feet around all runways and overruns. (See Attachment 2
     and reference AFI 13-213 and SAFB Sup 1 to AFI 13-213 for detailed CMA dimensions)
     1.4.2. All Instrument Landing System (ILS) critical areas and Precision Obstacle Free Zones
     (POFZs) will become protected areas when weather conditions reach certain parameters.
     When the reported ceiling is less than 800 ft and visibility is less than 2 miles, the ILS and
     POFZs will be protected and vehicles intending to transit the POFZs and Critical Areas must
     obtain permission from Sheppard Tower on the Airfield Net before proceeding. Weather
     minimums for protection of these areas can be found in FAAO 7110.65. When specific
     weather conditions (i.e., cloud ceilings or visibility) are in question, vehicles shall contact
     Sheppard Tower before entering the protected areas for clarification.
1.5. Airfield Lighting Systems (ALS).
     1.5.1. Approach and Runway Lighting. Airfield lighting will be operated in accordance with
     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, AFI 13-
     204v1-3, and local directives. For a complete list of all airfield lighting at Sheppard AFB,

portions of pavement and shall not be used to taxi aircraft: the pavement located northwest of
RWY 15R approach end leading to and including the closed apron; TWY A and TWY C
between TWY B and the approach end of RWY 35. (See Attachment 2)
1.7. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
   1.7.1. RWY 15R/33L has an MA1A barrier located 145’ into the overrun of RWY 15R and
   144’ into the overrun of RWY 33L; both MA1As are 3’ high. RWY 15C/33C has a BAK 15
   system that is 15’ high when activated, located 175’ into each overrun. The BAK 15 is
   remote activated by the Control Tower and will be raised when requested. During 80 FTW
   flying operations, the BAK 15 will only be configured for activation on the departure end of
   the runway.
   1.7.2. The MA1A arresting gear on RWY 15R/33L will be raised on the departure end of the
   runway during wing flying. The barrier on the approach end of the runway in use will be left
   in place but the energy absorbers will be disconnected. The Control Tower will coordinate
   with barrier maintenance/fire department personnel, as appropriate, to configure the barriers
   for 80 FTW flying operations.
   1.7.3. 82 CES/DS2 Power Production will perform two daily inspections of the barriers and
   advise AMOPS and Control Tower of barrier status and estimated downtime when

    maintenance is required. Additionally, they will provide air traffic controllers training on
    barrier operations, capabilities and limitations upon request.
    1.7.4. ATC shall use easy-to-understand descriptions such as ―operational/not operational‖
    and ―in service/out of service‖ when reporting the system status.
1.8. Parking Plan/Restrictions.
    1.8.1. Transient aircraft will park at the transient apron (see Attachment 2) when practical.
    Parking of large-frame and overflow aircraft will be coordinated by the Airfield Manager
    with appropriate agencies. EXCEPTION: Distinguished Visitor (DV) or other aircraft
    whose passengers have official business with the 80 FTW may be parked on the Euro-NATO
    Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) apron with the 80th Operations Group Commander’s (80
    OG/CC) coordination and approval.
NOTE: Due to a portion of the AOC Apron (See Attachment 2) located within the Clear Zone to Runway
17, AMOPS will coordinate with Transient Alert to ensure that no aircraft or support equipment is left
unattended any closer than 1 foot west of the eastern most taxilane on the AOC ramp.
    1.8.2. Any aircraft classified as ―Heavy‖ IAW JO 7110.65 will be parked as directed by
    AMOPS.
    1.8.3. AMOPS will notify 82d Security Forces (82 SFS) of priority aircraft information from
    the PPR log.
    1.8.4. The 82 SFS will coordinate with AMOPS prior to establishing a restricted area cordon
    at any location on the airfield.

2.1. Local Flying Area/Designation of Airspace.
   2.1.1. The Sheppard AFB local flying area is an extensive area that encompasses ATC
   Class D airspace, outlying airfields (Frederick) as well as training routes and MOAs, which
   locally assigned aircraft routinely use. RAPCON and Control Tower airspace is depicted in
   Attachments 5 and 6, respectively. The 80 FTW/CC designates the local flying area for
   wing-assigned aircraft.
   2.1.2. Alert/Restricted Areas: Applicable Alert/Restricted Areas to Sheppard AFB are A-
   561, A-636 and R-5601. Alert/Restricted Areas are defined in Area Planning AP/1A,
   Special Use Airspace North and South America. Additionally, a description of VR and IFR
   Military Training Routes (IR) near Sheppard’s airspace can be found in Area Planning
   AP/1B, Military Training Routes North and South America.
   2.1.3. Class D Airspace: When the Control Tower is open, the airspace is designated as
   Class D (see Attachment 6). Sheppard’s Class D is the airspace within a 4.9 NM radius of
   the geographical center of Sheppard AFB airfield, from the surface up to and including
   3,500’ MSL (2,500’ Above Ground Level [AGL]) and within 1 NM each side of the
   Wichita Falls localizer northwest course, extending from 4.9 NM to 5.7 NM northwest of the
   airport.
   2.1.4. Class E Airspace:   When the Control Tower is closed, the Class D airspace is
   designated as Class E.
   2.1.5. RAPCON: RAPCON’s area of jurisdiction is depicted in Attachment 5.
2.2. VFR Local Training Areas.
   2.2.1. Sheppard 1 MOA/Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA): Sheppard 1

                      VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) PROCEDURES

3.1. VFR Weather Minimums.
   3.1.1. IAW the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), basic VFR is established at 1,000′
   ceiling and 3 statute miles (SM) visibility for Class D airspace.
   3.1.2. VFR Pattern Weather Minimums for Tower controlled VFR patterns: Ceiling must be
   a minimum of 500’ above published VFR pattern altitude and at least 3 SM visibility.
3.2. VFR Traffic Patterns. See Attachments 3 and 4.
   3.2.1. The normal break zone for initial traffic is between the approach end threshold and
   3,000’ down the runway. ATC may issue adjustments to break for spacing and sequencing.
   If no break point is specified, 80 FTW aircraft will break in the normal break zone. If a
   break point is specified along with a sequence/traffic call, it is the 80 FTW aircraft’s
   obligation to accept the sequence, or to request re-sequencing.
   3.2.2. ATC will approve closed traffic requests based on traffic. Aircraft requesting closed
   traffic may be directed to "extend" for sequencing. ATC approval for a closed traffic pattern
   prior to the departure end of the runway is authorization for an aircraft to initiate an
   immediate closed traffic pattern regardless of its position.
   3.2.3. Low Closed Pattern: T-6 aircraft are authorized to conduct low closed traffic pattern
   at 500’ AGL while under RSU control.

       *15R/33L Overhead pattern altitude of 2,800’ and direction may also be flown to
       15C/33C due to Runway 15R/33L closure.
       **15L/33R overhead pattern altitude of 2,000’ and direction may be flown to
       15C/33C or 15R/33L due to Runway 15L/33R closure.
  3.2.4. A low approach with an altitude restriction of not less than 500’ AGL may be
  authorized except over an aircraft in departure position or a departing aircraft. Restricted low
  approaches may be issued to aircraft when vehicles and/or equipment on the runway or
  overrun(s) preclude aircraft from completing an unrestricted approach. Altitude for restricted
  low approach for heavy aircraft will not be less than 1,000’ AGL.
  3.2.5. VFR patterns/practice instrument approaches by transient military aircraft that do not
  impede 80 FTW training will be approved on a case-by-case basis and coordinated between
  ATC and the SOF. Practice approaches by civilian aircraft to RWYs 15R/33L, 15C/33C and
  15L/33R normally will not be approved at any time during wing flying.
  3.2.6. Aircraft conducting overhead approaches to the center runway shall be at Control
  Tower’s discretion or IAW Table 3.1.
3.3. T-6 High-Altitude Power Loss (HAPL)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP)
Procedures.
  3.3.1. HAPL operations will only be conducted in Sheppard 1/Sheppard 2 MOAs to a Non-
  Tower Airfield (NTA) between sunrise and sunset.
     3.3.1.1. Pilots will request HAPL on departure on initial call-up, along with the rest of
     their flight requirements (ex. ―BladeXX, off departure passing 2,100’, request High,
     HAPL, Hacker/Duncan/Chattanooga/etc…‖).
     3.3.1.2. Once the HAPL is approved within their assigned area, the aircraft will begin a
     slow descent until reaching 8,500’ MSL. Upon reaching/passing 8,500' MSL, the aircraft
     will cancel IFR and proceed VFR direct to Hacker (or requested NTA) to complete an
     Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP).
  3.3.2. ELP procedures may be conducted at the following airfields: Sheppard AFB,
  Lawton/Ft Sill, Duncan, Hacker, Bowie Municipal, Chattanooga Municipal, Chickasha
  Municipal and Paul’s Valley Municipal. Aircraft will report High Key, Low Key and Base
  Key (See Table 3.1. for pattern altitudes).
     3.3.2.1. Weather requirements: Ceiling 500’ above approved High Key altitude and
     flight and ground visibility must be reported to be at least 3 miles.
     3.3.2.2. ELP flight paths will be (as depicted in Attachment 4) directly over the runway
     and remain within the lateral limits of the Class Delta surface area (Sheppard AFB only).
     ELPs conducted at NTAs will offset High Key slightly.
     3.3.2.3. ELP aircraft may be instructed to "Hold at High Key" or may have their request
     denied with "Unable High Key" due to traffic or other reasons either before or after the
     start of the maneuver. Aircraft requests for High Key will be denied if another T-6 is
     already holding at High Key.
SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                             21


      3.3.2.4. In the event the Control Tower takes control of Cooter’s Runway and an ELP is
      in progress, the service by the Control Tower does not in any way absolve the pilot from
      his/her responsibility from complying with 14 CFR part 91 and/or applicable military
      directives.
3.4. Special Procedures.
   3.4.1. Helicopter Procedures: Helicopters landing or departing Sheppard AFB will comply
   with RWY 17/35 procedures during 80 FTW operations.
   3.4.2. Protection of the Overhead Traffic Patterns: All transient aircraft departing from
   RWY 15R/33L will be issued runway heading to 2,400’ to ensure protection of the overhead
   pattern. When Cooter is using RWY 15C/33C, transient aircraft will normally not be
   allowed to depart off the center runway.
   3.4.3. Afterburner Climbs: All afterburner climbs will be conducted IAW the Fort Worth
   Air Traffic Control Center (ZFW)/Sheppard AFB RAPCON/80 FTW Letter of Agreement
   (LOA) and ZFW/Sheppard AFB RAPCON LOA.
   3.4.4. Unusual Maneuvers: ATC shall not solicit or approve any requests for a pilot to
   conduct unusual maneuvers within the Class D airspace. Unusual maneuvers include:
   unnecessary low passes, unscheduled flybys and practice instrument approaches to altitudes
   below specified minima (unless a landing or touch and go is to be made).
      3.4.4.1. Procedures such as ―Spiral up‖, ―Spiral down‖ and ―Threat Avoidance
      Procedures‖ are not practiced at Sheppard AFB; therefore, they are not authorized.
   3.4.5. Low-Level VFR Departure. Workload permitting, the Control Tower will attempt to
   provide a minimum of 3-minute spacing between departures flying the same low-level route.
   3.4.6. Tactical Initial Procedures. Tactical initial will only be available for use when the
   Control Tower is controlling 15C/33C and 15R/33L simultaneously, with an unrestricted
   pattern. Tactical initial may be flown in 2-, 3- or 4-ship formation.
      3.4.6.1. Pilots will request ―Tac Initial‖ with the Control Tower upon initial contact,
      normally 10-15 miles from the field.
      3.4.6.2. When the Control Tower approves tactical initial and controls all runways, the
      flight lead(s) will line up over TWY D and the wingmen will line up approximately
      4,000’-5,000’ line-abreast formation. If the Control Tower does not control RWY
      15L/33R, wingmen will line up no further east than RWY 15C/33C.
      3.4.6.3. Pilots will report both ―7-mile and 3-mile Tac Initial.‖ If a 3-ship formation, the
      pilot will report ―C/S 2+1 Tac Initial.‖ If a 4-ship formation, the pilot will report ―C/S
      2+2 Tac Initial.‖
3.5. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Procedures.
   3.5.1. Similar trainer-type RSRS may only be applied using alternate runway side
   procedures. Similar trainer-type aircraft are defined as two or more aircraft of the same
   airframe; for example, T-38/T-38 and T-6/T-6. See Table 3.2. for RSRS distances for similar
   type aircraft operations.

      3.5.1.1. RSRS for similar trainer-type aircraft is 3,000’ or the preceding aircraft is
      airborne when using alternate runway side procedures.
      3.5.1.2. When alternate runway side procedures are not or cannot be employed, the
      minimum RSRS is 6,000’ in all cases.
      3.5.1.3. If both formation aircraft are positioned on the same side of the runway, RSRS
      of 3,000’ may be applied between a landing formation and a subsequent arriving single
      aircraft.
      3.5.1.4. During night operations, RSRS is 6,000’ minimum, if the controller can see the
      aircraft involved and determine distances by references to suitable nighttime landmarks
      (lighted distance markers, etc.). Otherwise, standard FAA separation will apply.

   3.5.2. Dissimilar trainer-type aircraft are defined as a mix of different airframes; for
   example, T-38/T-6, T-1/T-38. See Table 3.3. for RSRS distances for dissimilar type aircraft
   operations.
      3.5.2.1. RSRS for dissimilar trainer-type aircraft is 6,000’ minimum in all cases.
      3.5.2.2. In all cases, these procedures apply to allow arrival following arrival, arrival
      following departure and departure following departure operations. For departures
      following arrivals, the preceding landing aircraft, regardless of category, must be clear of
      the runway before the departure begins takeoff roll. There is no RSRS for a departure
      following an arrival operation.
      3.5.2.3. During night operations, RSRS is 6,000’ minimum, if the controller can see the
      aircraft involved and determine distances by references to suitable nighttime landmarks
      (lighted distance markers, etc.). Otherwise, standard FAA separation will apply.

   type aircraft and any other non-trainer aircraft, when an emergency aircraft is involved, when
   braking action is less than fair, anytime the Control Tower determines the safety of aircraft
   will be jeopardized and when the RCR is less than 14.
3.6. Intersection Departures. All aircraft requesting intersection departures will be given the
appropriate information IAW JO 7110.65. (See Table 1.1.).
3.7. Wind Variable Information. IAW AFI 13-204v3, Section 7.10.2.2, the 80 OG/CC waives
the requirement to issue variable wind information to 80 FTW-assigned aircraft in order to
provide expeditious and efficient pattern control.

                                           Chapter 4

                  INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR) PROCEDURES

4.1. Radar Traffic Patterns.
   4.1.1. Pattern Procedures: The RAPCON will vector the aircraft to a west downwind for a
   9-mile straight-in approach. After the turn to base, and the aircraft is able to visually
   complete the approach, the pilot cancels IFR and proceeds with a VFR straight-in approach
   to RWY 15C/33C. If an aircraft needs vectors inside 10 DME, it will be cleared for a radar
   or instrument approach.
   4.1.2. Falls Pattern: Vectors to a 9-mile VFR straight-in approach to the center runway. The
   approach can be followed by an IFR departure to the areas, an entry to the VFR pattern or a
   full stop. The term ―Falls‖ is used whenever aircraft want vectors for a VFR straight-in
   approach to the center runway, regardless of whether it is after initial takeoff or after
   returning from the areas.
   4.1.3. Falls 2 Pattern: Used by aircrew in 2-ship formation who wish to return for an
   overhead to Tinder’s pattern and depart VFR for a ―Falls‖ formation straight-in approach to a
   full stop on the center runway. ―Falls 2‖ is coordinated between Control Tower and Tinder
   when the aircraft reach initial. Control Tower will advise Tinder if approved or disapproved.
   Tinder will advise the aircraft if Falls 2 is disapproved.
   4.1.4. IFR Last Pattern (ILP): Radar vectors to an instrument approach or radar final
   followed by an IFR departure. Depart runway heading and climb to 5,000’. Squawk
   assigned code.
4.2. Availability for Surveillance (ASR)
   4.2.1. The RAPCON will maintain ASR capability during 80 FTW operations based upon
   equipment availability.
   4.2.2. All instrument approaches shall be flight followed using the ASR indicator as
   requested by the pilot and based upon equipment availability.
4.3. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures. Upon request and availability, RAPCON will
provide radar vectors to initial.
4.4. Cancellation of Basic Radar Services. When any 80 FTW aircraft is instructed to contact
the appropriate RSU after receiving vectors to initial or pattern entry points, radar service is
automatically terminated and they need not be advised. Upon frequency change to the RSU, all
basic radar services are automatically cancelled.
   4.4.1. If aircraft cannot accept frequency change due to Instrument Meteorological
   Conditions (IMC), pilots will immediately notify ATC of their intentions (i.e., a lower
   altitude to attain Visual Meteorological Conditions [VMC], vectors for an instrument
   approach, etc.).
4.5. Locally Assigned T-38s.
   4.5.1. RWY 15C/33C is the primary T-38 launch runway for dual student sorties, and the
   Control Tower controls all launches.
SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                           25


   4.5.2. Formation Procedures:
      4.5.2.1. Spacing interval for T-38 formations is a minimum of 10 seconds between
      elements.
      4.5.2.2. Instrument Trail Departure: Aircraft pilots will advise ATC when using trail
      departure procedures. Spacing interval is a minimum of 20 seconds between elements.
      Lead aircraft will squawk a 47XX beacon code and trail aircraft will squawk 4700, or as
      assigned by RAPCON.
      4.5.2.3. Recovery Procedures: Formations that expect to encounter IMC conditions will
      normally request flight split up. Aircraft are required to advise RAPCON as early as
      possible of the flight’s intentions.
   4.5.3. Night Operations:
      4.5.3.1. RWY 15R/33L is the primary runway. Dual crews may depart from 15C/33C.
      4.5.3.2. Instrument Approaches: Instrument/straight-in approaches are not normally
      mixed with overhead patterns at night to Tinder’s runway. The SOF and Control Tower
      WS must approve instrument/straight-in approaches between sunset and sunrise.
   4.5.4. Simultaneous Instruments/Alternating Instruments:
      4.5.4.1. During simultaneous instruments, the Control Tower controls operations to all
      runways. The SOF will declare an alternate and touchdown fuel when the weather is
      below 1,500’ceiling or 3 miles visibility.
      4.5.4.2. During alternating instruments, squadrons must coordinate launch windows and
      every aircraft launch is linked to a takeoff time. Normally, T-38s launch 30 minutes after
      the last actual T-6 takeoff. Aircraft must be on final for a full-stop landing NLT 1 hour
      15 minutes after the launch window closes. Out-and-back missions may depart between
      T-38 and T-6 launch windows and must coordinate with their respective squadrons for a
      return window.
4.6. Locally Assigned T-6s.
   4.6.1. Pattern work for T-6s will be conducted to RWY 15L/33R.
   4.6.2. Aircraft using Sheppard 1/Sheppard 2 MOAs are cleared the Sheppard 1/Sheppard 2
   stereo respectively. Upon leveling at 14,000’ MSL, aircrews are automatically cleared to
   proceed direct to the lateral limits of the assigned area at 14,000’ MSL. Upon reaching the
   lateral limits of the area at 14,000’ MSL, aircrews may climb or descend into the area unless
   otherwise directed. Aircraft proceeding to Lawton/Henry Post Army Air Field (AAF) will
   normally be cleared direct the Lawton VOR at 6,000’ MSL; otherwise, continue on the
   Sheppard 1 stereo at 6,000’ MSL. Aircraft proceeding to Frederick will be cleared the Ranch
   stereo at 6,000’.
   4.6.3. Aircraft must fly the departure routing as published under normal conditions until
   leveling at 14,000’ MSL. They shall not request direct intermediate level-off or unrestricted
   climb to the areas. The ONLY exceptions are areas 10 and 13. Aircrews desiring a
   continuous area will normally be assigned areas 3, 7, 8, 13 or 14 to allow full use of the
   published departures.
 26                                              SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012


   4.6.4. Under instrument status, T-6s departing for slow routes will be cleared using the
   following phraseology: ―(A/C call sign), CLEARED TO THE WICHITA FALLS ZERO
   SIX THREE RADIAL, TWO FIVE DME FIX VIA RADAR VECTORS, MAINTAIN FIVE
   THOUSAND, DEPARTURE FREQUENCY WILL BE LOCAL CHANNEL SIX,
   SQUAWK (appropriate code).‖
   4.6.5. During Simultaneous Instruments Status, departure and recovery will normally be to
   RWY 15L/33R under Control Tower control on Channel 3 (279.525).
      4.6.5.1. During Alternating Instruments:
          4.6.5.1.1. Runway 15: Departures will be from RWY 15R and arrivals will be to
          RWY 15C.
          4.6.5.1.2. Runway 33: Departures will be from RWY 33C and arrivals will be to
          RWY 33L.
   4.6.6. RWY 17/35 landing procedures: T-6s landing RWY 17/35 will enter Class D over the
   Wichita Falls VORTAC (SPS) at 2,400’ and depart heading 075 for RWY 17 or depart
   heading 115 for RWY 35.
      4.6.6.1. Upon calling the airport/runway in sight, RAPCON will issue Visual Approach
      clearance with the crossing restriction over SPS VORTAC IAW procedures listed in
      FAA JO 7110.65 for the visual approach. Phraseology used: ―(A/C call sign), CROSS
      THE WICHITA FALLS VORTAC AT TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED,
      CLEARED VISUAL APPROACH RUNWAY (17 or 35).‖
      4.6.6.2. RAPCON should transfer communication to the Control Tower when 10 miles
      from airport but no later than SPS VORTAC.
      4.6.6.3. Control Tower will provide visual separation between IFR arrivals/departures to
      RWY 15 and RWY 17. If unable, advise RAPCON.
4.7. Radar-In Trail Recovery. Not applicable at Sheppard AFB.
4.8. Military Operations Area (MOA) Procedures. The following paragraphs clarify services
provided to 80 FTW-assigned aircraft operating in the Sheppard 1/Sheppard 2 MOAs.
   4.8.1. All 80 FTW-assigned aircraft are provided IFR service to and from the Sheppard
   1/Sheppard 2 MOAs to the maximum extent possible.
   4.8.2. All 80 FTW-assigned aircraft operating within and transiting the confines of Sheppard
   1/Sheppard 2 MOAs are considered participating aircraft.
   4.8.3. Aircraft established within the MOAs remain IFR and are provided merging target
   procedures as defined in FAA JO 7610.4.
      4.8.3.1. Merging target procedures are applied only during VMC conditions. The
      application standards are ―targets do not touch‖ or a ―form of vertical separation is
      known.‖ Acceptable vertical separation between two participating aircraft is 500’.
      4.8.3.2. If a pilot informs he/she is encountering IMC conditions, then standard IFR
      separation is applied. It is the pilot’s responsibility to inform ATC when encountering
      IMC conditions.

        and Hazardous Cargo Log.
        5.2.7.5. Test backup procedures quarterly as coordinated by AMOPS.
5.3. Emergency/Mishap/Disaster Airfield Response Procedures.
    5.3.1. All response procedures will follow general guidance found in the Sheppard
    CEMP 10-2; Emergency Response plan. The Airfield Operations Flight will follow the
    mishap response checklist per this instruction (Attachment 8) and local operating
    instructions. The AOF/CC will be the Airfield Operations Flight point of contact for all
    information pertaining to an aircraft mishap; with the exception to any direct coordination
    effort regarding emergency response. All mishap data from the RAPCON, Control Tower
    and AMOPS will flow through the AOF/CC.
    5.3.2. When an emergency, mishap, or a disaster occurs on the airfield:
        5.3.2.1. First Response:
            5.3.2.1.1. First responders (Fire Department/Medical/Security Forces) will respond
            directly to the incident site for preservation of life, resources and set up of initial site
            security.     Emergency/Mishap response does NOT supersede airfield driving
            standards. Responders shall obtain ATC approval prior to entering the CMA or
            active runways.
            5.3.2.1.2. The Control Tower will follow the emergency or mishap response
            checklist and will coordinate the expeditious movement of first responders in
            accordance with the RSU, Control Tower and RAPCON Operations letter. AMOPS
            will be given priority to access all runways to accomplish a runway check. Following
            an emergency, it will be the SOF’s call if an airfield check is NOT needed by
            AMOPS and if wing flying will continue. See paragraph 5.2.2.1. for specific
            AMOPS guidance.
            5.3.2.1.3. The RSU or controlling agency will expedite movement of first responders
            in accordance with the RSU/RAPCON/Tower Operations Letter. Following a
            mishap, the Control Tower will retain control of the affected runways until a suitable
            FOD check can be accomplished by AMOPS.
NOTE: Following a mishap event, AMOPS will suspend operations to affected runways. Only aircraft
unable to stay in the pattern due to an emergency situation may use the runways at the discretion of the SOF
SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                                            31


and at the pilot’s own risk. All aircraft will be directed to divert or to land following the runway status
report from AMOPS.
        5.3.2.2. Secondary Emergency Response:
             5.3.2.2.1. Following an emergency, AMOPS may suspend operations to affected
             runways and conduct an airfield check unless waived by the SOF. AMOPS will
             document all SOF-waived runway checks in the AMOPS AF IMT 3616. Following a
             mishap, AMOPS will suspend operations to affected runways, conduct an airfield
             check and report results to the Control Tower. AMOPS will send NOTAMs closing
             all affected airfield surfaces. AMOPS will not approach the emergency or mishap
             aircraft.
             5.3.2.2.2. Flight Safety will respond to emergencies and mishaps to preserve initial
             evidence and information. Flight Safety will not approach the incident aircraft until
             the emergency is terminated or given the all clear from the incident commander or
             Senior Fire Official. Flight Safety may augment AMOPS in checking the runways
             after a mishap or multiple IFEs occurring simultaneously on more than one runway.
             This will minimize downtime for aircraft operations while clean-up efforts are
             undertaken.
             5.3.2.2.3. Other emergency responders will meet at the emergency support staging
             areas as depicted in Attachment 2. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) shall
             coordinate with AMOPS or AOF/CC and the incident commander prior to placing
             items or vehicles in the CMA as depicted in Attachment 2.
    5.3.3. The Senior Fire Official is the termination authority for emergencies. Fire Department
    will visually check all emergency aircraft prior to taxi back to parking.
    5.3.4. Fire Department (82 CES/CEF) personnel will position vehicles in order to follow
    emergency aircraft down the runway/taxiway until the aircraft stops or exits the active
    runway. They will remain with the aircraft until the emergency is terminated.
    5.3.5. When Flight Medicine dispatches an ambulance, they will pre-position at one of the
    emergency staging areas (Attachment 2) until their assistance is required or until the
    emergency is terminated.
    5.3.6. The Control Tower will relay emergency termination notices to AMOPS only when
    the incident commander or Senior Fire Official has confirmed termination. AMOPS
    personnel will relay termination instructions over the SCN. When the Control Tower is
    closed, the incident commander or Senior Fire Official will relay emergency termination to
    the Command Post.
    5.3.7. The AOF/CC will relay airfield operational status to the 80 OG/CC and the EOC to
    assist in the determination for further airfield closures or restrictions to local flying.
    5.3.8. Following a mishap, the installation commander is the airfield closure authority. If the
    airfield remains open, the 80 OG/CC will determine if wing flying should continue.
    5.3.9. AOF personnel shall not release the names of individuals allegedly involved in an
    aircraft incident or accident to agencies outside US Air Force channels. AOF personnel shall
    not discuss the accident or incident beyond what is necessary to accomplish duties via the
 32                                            SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012


   crash phone. All inquiries from non-mishap response personnel must be directed to Public
   Affairs.
   5.3.10. In the event of an aircraft crash, tower’s Ground Control will transmit:
   ―ATTENTION ALL VEHICLES, ALL VEHICLES NOT RESPONDING TO THE
   AIRCRAFT EMERGENCY EXIT THE AIRFIELD IMMEDIATELY.‖
5.4. Emergency Jettison of External Stores. This area is defined as the Red River, flying
northwesterly, one-half mile either side of the SPS 295 radial, 17-24 DME at 2,500’ MSL. This
is a VFR procedure and aircraft shall self-navigate to the area to avoid any obstacles. RAPCON
may monitor/advise the aircraft when entering or leaving the area.
5.5. Fuel Dumping. Sheppard AFB has no designated fuel dumping area. If an aircraft requires
fuel dumping, ATC will use procedures IAW JO 7110.65.
5.6. Emergency Arresting Gear/Barrier Procedures.
   5.6.1. ATC will raise the BAK-15 IAW JO 7110.65.
   5.6.2. The MA1A arresting gear (unidirectional) on RWY 15R/33L requires approximately a
   6-hour reconfiguration period after an engagement. The BAK-15 arresting gear on
   RWY 15C/33C requires approximately a 5-hour reconfiguration period after an engagement.
   5.6.3. RWY 15C/33C approach end engagements are not authorized.
   5.6.4. AMOPS will transmit NOTAMs as required; 82 CES/DS2 Power Production will be
   notified via the Fire Department if a barrier engagement occurs; AMOPS will check and re-
   open the runway after the aircraft has been removed from the overrun.
5.7. Hot Brake Area and Procedures.
   5.7.1. The designated Hot Brakes areas are located at the hammerheads for TWY K and
   TWY G for RWY 15L/33R, hammerheads on TWY L and TWY F for RWY 15C/33C,
   hammerheads on TWY H and TWY C west of RWY 15R/33L, and TWY G and TWY F
   west of RWY 15R/33L as depicted on the airfield diagram, Attachment 2.
   5.7.2. Aircrews suspecting hot brakes will call the Control Tower to advise of the situation
   and to provide aircraft identification and location. The aircrew will then taxi to one of the
   designated hot brake areas as necessary.
5.8. Hazardous Cargo Areas. Sheppard AFB is not approved to receive hazardous cargo. The
nearest available military installation is Henry Post AAF. If an emergency aircraft diverts with
hazardous cargo, the Control Tower should taxi the aircraft to TWY G between RWY 15R/33L
and TWY D. AMOPS will inform 82 TRW/SE who will in turn evaluate and determine further
actions. AMOPS shall issue a NOTAM closing the appropriate areas until further advised.
Aircraft with Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo will be handled IAW JO 7110.65.
5.9. Hydrazine Areas. The designated Hydrazine areas are located at TWY G (between
RWY 15R/33L and TWY D) as depicted on the airfield diagram, Attachment 2.
5.10. Abandonment of Aircraft.
   5.10.1. Controlled Bailout Area: The controlled egress/bailout area is the SPS 290 radial 10
   DME at 10,000’ MSL, at approximate latitude/longitude coordinates of N34.04.240/
   W098.46.040.
SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                              33


   5.10.2. Ejection: When conditions allow, the crew or other aircraft in the area should
   attempt to relay the information on the location as soon as possible.
   5.10.3. Plotting Aircraft Coordinates: When an incident occurs on base and ATC can
   approximately determine the location of the abandoned aircraft, they will plot grid map
   coordinates from left to right then bottom to top. Using the overlay, determine the smaller
   grid in question and pass the information, stating main grid followed by sub grid.
5.11. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
Response Procedures.
   5.11.1. ATC agencies will not activate the primary crash phone for ELT signals not
   immediately known to be associated with an emergency. IAW AFI 13-204v3, notification
   and response procedures are as follows:
      5.11.1.1. The RAPCON will advise Control Tower and Fort Worth Center of all
      information concerning ELT signals heard or reported. If RAPCON is closed, Control
      Tower will notify Fort Worth Center.
      5.11.1.2. The Control Tower will notify RAPCON (if closed, Command Post) of ELT
      signals heard or reported, and notify AMOPS (if closed, Command Post) via direct line of
      ELTs of unknown source. Notify AMOPS and RAPCON when an ELT is determined
      not to be an emergency and when the signal ceases.
      5.11.1.3. AMOPS will take the following action to determine the source of an ELT
      signal not immediately known to be associated with an emergency:
          5.11.1.3.1. Notify Aircrew Flight Equipment to check if the signal is originating on
          the apron or in the parachute room. (DSN 736-4231)
          5.11.1.3.2. If the signal continues, notify the Egress shop to validate the source of the
          signal. (DSN 736-1520 or 736-1026)
          5.11.1.3.3. If the signal continues, notify the 361 TRS to validate the source of the
          signal. (DSN 736-5328 or 736-0699)
          5.11.1.3.4. If the signal continues, notify Fort Worth Center so they may coordinate
          with the Rescue Coordination Center.
5.12. Hung Ordnance Procedures. Aircraft with hung ordnance will stop on TWY F between
RWY 15C/33C and RWY 15R/33L. Contact 82 TRW/SEG to obtain an appropriate direction
for the aircraft away from heavily populated areas.
5.13. Wind Limitations on Control Tower. The Control Tower, building 1902, is designed to
withstand wind speeds of up to 90 MPH/72 knots. The Control Tower Cab will be evacuated
when the wind speed exceeds 75 MPH/65 knots.
5.14. Evacuation of ATC and AM Operations Facilities.
   5.14.1. Evacuation of AMOPS facilities is addressed in the AMOPS Quick-Reaction
   Checklist (QRC).
   5.14.2. Control Tower Evacuation: The WS is responsible for determining the nature and
   extent at which an evacuation is conducted. If the WS deems an evacuation is necessary,
   he/she will follow the guidelines outlined in the Control Tower Operating Instruction 13-204.
 34                                           SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012


       5.14.2.1. Severe Weather Evacuations: Severe weather evacuations are conducted due to
       high winds, observed tornadoes, tornado sirens and other severe weather phenomena as
       determined by the WS.
           5.14.2.1.1. Controllers will relocate to the second floor or to the parking lot IAW
           Control Tower OI 31-101, Resource Protection and Controlled Area procedures.
           5.14.2.1.2. Time permitting, controllers may evacuate to the Fire Department for
           shelter.
       5.14.2.2. In the event of an evacuation, if able, Control Tower will activate the PCAS
       and state ―THE TOWER IS EVACUATING DUE TO (Reason).‖ Do not waste any time
       explaining anything else on the PCAS. In turn, AMOPS will activate the SCN with the
       applicable information.
   5.14.3. RAPCON Evacuation: Immediately evacuate all nonessential personnel IAW
   RAPCON OI 31-101, Resource and Protection and Controlled Area procedures, for bomb
   threats, fire, gas leaks, etc. using the Fire Evacuation or Facility Bomb Threat checklists.
   There are no alternate facilities available to allow continued service and no requirement to
   maintain a fly-away kit for such purposes.
       5.14.3.1. In the event of a tornado, RAPCON personnel will remain in building 1903.
       Additional locations and procedures for evacuation are detailed in the RAPCON WS Fire
       Evacuation or Bomb Threat Checklists.
5.15. Alternate Facilities.
   5.15.1. Control Tower: During an actual evacuation, continuation of ATC services will be
   accomplished from the active RSU. The Control Tower will use the departure end RSU
   during exercises. All procedures are followed IAW Control Tower Operating Instruction
   13-204.
   5.15.2. RAPCON: The RAPCON has no alternate facility for continuation of ATC services.
   5.15.3. AMOPS: During an actual evacuation, temporary continuance of AMOPS services
   will be accomplished from building 1360. A fly-away kit is prepared and located in AMOPS
   in the event of an evacuation. All procedures will be followed IAW with a QRC developed
   by the Airfield Manager.
5.16. Other Emergency Procedures.
   5.16.1. Single Frequency Approach (SFA). Upon request, IFE aircraft will be changed to
   RAPCON’s discrete ATC frequency 360.625 (Ch 18) and remain on that frequency until
   landing. In the event of simultaneous emergencies, RAPCON may assign a different discrete
   ATC frequency to subsequent SFA aircraft. When RAPCON receives an SFA request,
   RAPCON will be responsible for ensuring the Control Tower is immediately notified to
   monitor the SFA frequency. The Control Tower WS will ensure the SOF and the respective
   RSUs are notified immediately to monitor the SFA frequency. When an aircraft pilot
   requests an SFA with any agency other than the RAPCON, the controlling agency will
   request Ch 18 from RAPCON and ensure all other facilities (Control Tower, SOF, and
   appropriate RSUs) are notified to monitor the SFA frequency.
SHEPPARDAFBI13-204 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      35


        5.16.1.1. The SOF shall not transmit on the SFA frequency without prior coordination
        with the Control Tower WS IAW AFI 13-204v3. All agencies monitor the frequency
        until the IFE is terminated.
        5.16.1.2. Transferring control of the aircraft and the frequency will be done through
        landline using the following phraseology:             ―(Aircraft Position), (Call sign)
        EMERGENCY, CHANNEL 18 IS YOUR CONTROL.‖ A communications check or
        instructions issued to the aircraft on the SFA frequency will be the indication that control
        of the frequency has been transferred. Controlling agencies will not broadcast
        simultaneously on the SFA.
        5.16.1.3. The emergency aircraft pilot may request to land on any runway but will land
        under RAPCON or Control Tower control to reduce workload and frequency congestion
        of the RSU. To avoid the RSU pattern, emergency aircraft should fly or request vectors
        to a 10-mile final or final portion of an instrument approach. The SFA will not be used
        for aircraft holding in the RSU’s pattern (i.e., High Pattern).
        5.16.1.4. RAPCON will transfer communication and control of the emergency aircraft to
        Control Tower no later than 10 NM from the field, or as otherwise coordinated. After
        landing and once the aircraft has come to a complete stop, the controlling agency will
        advise the pilot to contact the On-Scene Commander on 228.0 (Ch 19), when necessary.
        5.16.1.5. SFA Termination. Once the Senior Fire Official has terminated the emergency,
        the aircraft will utilize standardized Control Tower frequencies. Control Tower
        personnel will notify RAPCON when Ch 18 is returned to RAPCON control.
        5.16.1.6. SFA Exercise:
            5.16.1.6.1. The 80 OG/OGV will attempt to schedule a monthly SFA check with a
            minimum of once a quarter to ensure SFA capability. 80 OG/OGV will inform the
            AOF/CC at least 48 hours prior and provide the call sign and takeoff/land time;
            however, random checks may be accomplished to preserve the integrity of the SFA.
            The WS will be the safety observer or as assigned by the AOF/CC. The observer
            should evaluate the progress of the exercise and ensure the exercise does not degrade
            flying operations or impact flight safety. The observer may terminate the exercise at
            any point due to potential impact on controller workload or safety.
            5.16.1.6.2. The SFA exercise will be initiated by the Flight Examiner (FE) by
            starting the request of the SFA with ―Exercise, Exercise, Exercise.‖ The controlling
            agency will use the preface ―Exercise, Exercise, Exercise‖ on initial contact via the
            landline when informing other participating agencies.
NOTE: If real-world operational/emergency requirements prevent participation in the SFA exercise, the
appropriate agency will declare “unable.” In this case, the FE will not initiate or he/she will terminate
this procedure. During the exercise, the Control Tower WS may terminate it using the phraseology
“knock it off, knock it off.”
            5.16.1.6.3. The FE will terminate the exercise on landing rollout. The FE will fill out
            a debrief sheet in 80 OG/OGV for record keeping and will debrief with the following:
            RAPCON, Control Tower, SOF Program Manager, T-6/T-38 RSU Training and
            Standardization Officer (RSUTSO), if applicable. Copies of debrief sheets will be
            made available on request.

                           RUNWAY CHANGE PROCEDURES

A7.1. General: This runway change procedure is event driven and is organized around ―four
main events.‖ The intent is to always have a runway available to land on and to minimize
training delays. Before the center runway closes, student solos airborne longer than 20 minutes
will recover to applicable pattern (SOF directed). Additionally, the Ops Sup will stop stepping
pilots approximately 10 minutes prior to the center runway closing. Individual section
checklists/procedures will be derived from this section and Table A7.1.
A7.2. Center Runway Closed:
   A7.2.1. The Control Tower will make the Guard call: “Sheppard Tower on Guard, Sheppard
   runway change in progress center runway operations suspended.”
   A7.2.2. The barrier on the center runway will be re-configured to the new direction.
   A7.2.3. Ground will stop taxiing aircraft to the ―old‖ runway; expect a 10-15 minute delay.
   A7.2.4. Aircraft will continue to recover via the current radar drop off. Normally, the VFR
   entry points should not be used during a runway change procedure.
   A7.2.5. RSU personnel will inform pilots of imminent RSU closure in approximately 10
   minutes.
   A7.2.6. RSU personnel will direct student solos to land. T-6 and T-38 with less than
   700/1,200 lbs of fuel respectively will make a full stop.
A7.3. Center Runway Opens:
   A7.3.1. Operations Supervisor will start stepping pilots.
   A7.3.2. Aircraft will be vectored to the new radar drop-off point. Pilots may expect to hold
   for a minimum amount of time while the RSU pattern direction is being changed.
   A7.3.3. RSU personnel will direct aircraft in the pattern to perform the runway change
   break-out procedure.
   A7.3.4. After RSU personnel initiate the runway change break-out procedure, the Control
   Tower will take control of the pattern/runway. The RSU will direct all aircraft to switch to
   Control Tower frequency.
A7.4. RSU Closed/Control Tower Controls VFR Pattern in New Direction:
   A7.4.1. The Control Tower will make the Guard call: “Sheppard Tower on Guard, runway
   XX in use, limited operations.”
   A7.4.2. Ground will start taxiing aircraft to new runway.
   A7.4.3. Pilots should only make a radio call when passing initial. Minimize radio
   transmissions to prevent radio congestion. Use standard terminology (not RSU standard).
   A7.4.4. While under Control Tower control, carry straight-through initial and fly around the
   outside pattern. When a full stop is required, add ―Full Stop‖ to your initial call, make the

   ―in-the-break call‖ and ―gear-down call‖ on left/right base. Make sure the Control Tower
   clears you to land before touching down.
A7.5. RSU Open in New Direction:
   A7.5.1. RSU personnel will take control of the pattern/runway.
   A7.5.2. The Control Tower will direct aircraft to switch to Tinder/Cooter frequency.
   A7.5.3. The Control Tower will make the Guard call: “Sheppard Tower on Guard, runway
   change completed.”
   A7.5.4. Normal ops resume.
A7.6. Restricted Pattern Runway Change:
   A7.6.1. RSUs will direct all aircraft in the pattern to full stop or depart.
   A7.6.2. When pattern is empty, RSUs will give control of the pattern/runway to the Control
   Tower.
   A7.6.3. Recovering aircraft will be vectored to the new radar drop-off point. Pilots may
   expect to hold for a minimum amount of time. In case of emergency/min fuel, coordinate
   with the Control Tower/RAPCON to land or divert if needed.
   A7.6.4. After the runway change (right after the moment the center runway opens in the new
   direction), aircraft will enter the VFR pattern from the new radar drop off point and make a
   straight-in approach to a full stop under Control Tower control.
   A7.6.5. When RSUs are in place, the Control Tower will give control of the pattern/runway
   back to RSUs.
   A7.6.6. Restricted pattern ops resume.
A7.7. Simultaneous/Alternating Instruments Runway Change: When Runway 15C is in use
during an instrument status, the barriers on the runway 15R/33L will be reconfigured first.

Before the RSU pattern direction change (at action item D-1), all aircraft in the pattern will full stop or
depart the pattern (additional RSU action item at B-7).

After the pattern direction change, aircraft entering the VFR pattern from the radar drop-off point will
make a straight-in approach to a full stop under Control Tower control (change to Control Tower action
item at D-6).

Runway change during an Instrument Status:
When Runway 15C is in use during an instrument status, the Control Tower will re-configure the barrier
on Runway 15R first (change to Control Tower action item at A-8). When the barrier on Runway
15R/33L is changed to Runway 33L, Control Tower/RAPCON will switch recoveries to Runway 33L with
the immediate availability of the ILS 33L.
