9. Procedures for Selecting a Winner
   9.1. Board members will review each package and score each section based solely on the
   information required in paragraph 7 and the guidance in Attachment 13 of this instruction.
   Each nominee’s total score will be calculated to determine relative ranking with the other
   nominees. Board members will annotate their rankings on their score sheet (Attachments 2,
   4 or 6), sign and return it to the board president. Board members are encouraged to discuss
   the points/rankings and attempt to resolve any ties. If a tie cannot be broken by the voting
   members, the board president will break the tie.
   9.2. The board president’s rankings will only be used in the event of a tie. The board
   president will review each package and score each section IAW Table 9.1. of this instruction.
   The board president will use the Board President Score Sheet, Attachments 3, 5 or 7. The
   board president may only use the rank the board members have assigned to the nominees.
   The rankings will be totaled and the member with the lowest total will be forwarded to the 8
   FW/CC for final selection.

                           GUIDE FOR BOARD EVALUATIONS

A13.1. Selection: Selection will be based on a combination of the AF IMT 1206 (80 points)
and the personal board interview (20 points). When required, the board president will facilitate
open discussion to resolve any disparities that could skew the scoring process. Resolution is
required when the ranking order is inconsistent with a winner based on total points (i.e. Sgt Jones
has the least total points but three of the five board members have another nominee ranked as
their number 1).
   A13.1.1. AF IMT 1206, Nomination for Award: Effective evaluation of the AF IMT 1206
   requires a detailed thought process; it is challenging to review nomination packages and
   determine who are the ―Best of the Best.‖ Each board member must remember it is not the
   writer; it is the accomplishment of the nominee which makes the difference. Strong emphasis
   must be on initiative, achievement and impact, not writing style. When evaluating an AF
   IMT 1206, the individual’s quarterly write-up cannot exceed 15 lines (including the three
   category headings) or no more than 30 lines for annual awards (including headings).
   Attachments 8 - 12 contain the required distribution of lines. The total possible points that
   can be awarded are 80. The three approved categories listed below will be scored. Each line
   will be evaluated on its own merit as it relates within the respective category. Board members
   may award maximum points to each section using whole or half point increments. Board
   presidents must break all ties.
Heading                                                                         Point Value
Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty                                  1 – 60
Significant Self-Improvement                                                    1 – 10
Base or Community Involvement                                                   1 – 10
       A13.1.1.1. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty. The individual’s
       primary duty accomplishments are the most important element of the nomination
       package. This is the most difficult section to score because everyone does an outstanding
       job in his or her area of expertise. Below are guidelines to assist board members in
       differentiating the impact on the mission and leadership role.
       Impact on the entire Wolf Pack team
       Innovative methods/programs developed, designed, implemented and impact
       Process Improvement – cost savings, percentage improved or reduced
       Superior leadership or training skills
       Quantification and qualification of results
       Key additional duties with significant impact
       Wing working group or committee chair/member
       Higher HQ, service unique or DoD involvement
       Unit/Wing/Group/command-level and higher awards (both individual and unit; deployed
       or homestation)
       A13.1.1.2. Significant Self Improvement. The primary focus of this section is the
       individual’s professional and personal development and how it benefits the USAF. The
       key factors to this category are individual commitment level and personal sacrifice. You
8FWI 36-2801 27 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  25


       can judge this by answering the following questions. How much time was expended?
       How much effort was involved? Was the achievement done on duty or during off-duty
       time?
       Off-duty Education College (in-residence, on-line, correspondence classes, etc.)
       Upgrade Training (5-level completion, CDC progress, formal training courses, etc.)
       Advanced career field or Military Occupational Specialty training
       Readiness training
       Conference or symposiums related to job or career field/specialty (how nominee used
       information to improve process, mission impact, etc.)
       A13.1.1.3. Base or Community Involvement. This section rounds out the whole
       person concept. Unit and base activities/support should be weighed more heavily on
       community involvement because they directly impact the Wolf Pack and the surrounding
       community. Again, the individual’s commitment level and personal sacrifice are key
       factors in evaluating this section. How much time and effort was involved? What was
       the amount of time committed to the achievement and the frequency? Did the member
       participate or lead the effort?
       Involvement in professional organizations
       Key leadership position on executive council coupled by the achievement or results
       Color/Honor Guard and sustained participation
       Leadership position or role in community
       Special Olympics, Boy Scouts, Big Brother/Sister, etc. (Number of hours and frequency)
       Coaching sporting teams (squadron intramural teams, adult or youth programs, etc.)
       Participating in major community ceremonies such as unit member retirement,
       POW/MIA vigil, retreat, marched in community parade while in uniform (i.e., Veteran’s
       Day, Fourth of July, and Liberation Day)
       Base Sponsored Programs
       Quarterly/Annual Awards Committee
   A13.1.2. Face-to-Face Interview. The primary purpose of the face-to-face board is to
   ensure nominees’ dress and appearance, military bearing, oral expression and articulation of
   responses. This is a very subjective area for board members to evaluate and you must
   baseline your judgment against military standards. The total possible points that can be
   awarded are 20. The three approved categories listed below will be scored.
Category                                                                          Point Value
Military Bearing                                                                  1–5
Dress and Appearance                                                              1–5
Communication Skills                                                              1 – 10
       A13.1.2.1. Dress and Appearance: Uniform: cleaned, pressed and proper fitting.
Accouterments: properly placed on the uniform.
Jewelry: not more than three rings, correct earrings, no visible necklace, etc.
Decorations: ribbons in proper order, clean/serviceable condition.

contacting the board members to provide instructions in regards to preparing board questions.
The board president will task each of the board members with a specific category (see below for
categories). Board members are to prepare three questions (two primaries and one alternate) for
their respective tasked board category. Questions will be opinionated, thought provoking, and
designed to assess the nominee’s ability to organize thoughts and articulate a response. Questions
will come from some or all of the following areas:
   A13.2.1. Questions for the Airman Category:
       A13.2.1.1. Current Events. General knowledge of current AF news or world events

                               PREPARING FOR THE BOARD

As the saying goes, ―First impressions are lasting impressions.‖ All boards allow points for
dress, appearance and military bearing. If you study and master the tips below, you will greatly
increase your chances for success.

Table A15.1. Preparing for the Board
                                                                                     Yes   No
Memorize: Airman’s Creed. Review: Study AFPAM 36-2241, Professional
Development Guide. The PDG is available on line. Current events are a must.
Review current month’s Airman Magazine and the Air Force Times. Current
event questions are usually compiled during the week before the board meets.
Gather the majority of your information during that time frame. Be prepared
to answer scenario based questions on how you would react/respond in
handling specific leadership situations (based on your rank and level of
responsibility). Questions will be designed to give your opinion but you must
know some information about topics.
Write down your goals, aspirations and extracurricular activities (and practice
expressing them verbally). Example: ―I have just finished my career
development course and I’m awaiting my 5-skill level. I’m enrolled in the
Community College of the Air Force and currently possess 24 credit hours. My
goal is to receive my Associate’s Degree within two years.‖ Board members
are judging (and scoring) how you express yourself.
Write down your hobbies and a brief synopsis of your career (and remember
them). This is often an icebreaker question and gives you a chance to talk
about yourself.
Study a copy of the narrative that accompanied your nomination. Board
members often ask you to expound on information they find in the write up.
Know your current chain of command.
Females: Wear slacks and low quarters or low heeled pumps. It’s easier to get
the length right on slacks than skirts and it’s less likely to change when you sit
and stand. Lower heels make it easier to make facing movements.
Practice facing movements in the same shoes you will be wearing when you
meet the board. Determine the location of the board and practice on the same
type floor covering (i.e., carpet, linoleum, etc.). If possible, do a pre-visit to
the area/room where the board will be held to familiarize yourself with your
surroundings.
Ensure your shoes look good. If it is raining the day your board meets, carry
your shoes in a plastic bag and change when you get there. Ensure the soles of
your shoes are free of dirt and dust. Use polish and/or edge dressing and
ensure you have a fresh coat on. Take a small piece of cloth or old nylon hose
to wipe the dust off your shoes.
If the weather is bad, carry your uniform in a plastic bag and change when you
arrive.

Remember to always get your service dress dry cleaned as a set--never do your
trousers/skirt and coat separately. This will prevent uneven fading.
Ensure your collar brass and ribbons are pristine.
Ensure ribbons are in the proper order and any you wear are updated in the
Personnel Data System/VMPF.
Use masking tape to remove lint from your service dress coat.
Males: Consider wearing shirt garters. Droopy socks and a baggy shirt do not
convey the image of a winner.
Do not have anything in your pockets except your ID card--no keys, change,
etc.
If meeting the board in a short sleeve shirt, clean your name tag with wax to
remove scratches.
Males: Get a haircut within a few days before meeting the board.
Females: Ensure bangs are off your eyebrows and hair does not extend below
the bottom of your collar. Don’t even make it close—board members should
not have to look twice to see if you’re in compliance.
