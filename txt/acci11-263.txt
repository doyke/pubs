This instruction implements AFPD 11-2, Aircrew Operations, by establishing procedures for
grounding weapon systems and resuming operations. This instruction covers assets at a wing
level. Grounding of a wing’s aircraft cannot be delegated lower than the wing commander.
ACC/A3 (ANG: ANG/A3) must be notified of the grounding by the wing commander, and the
ACC/A3 (ANG: ANG/A3) has the sole authority to resume operations. This instruction is
applicable to all active duty ACC and Air National Guard (ANG) units. ANG/A3 has grounding
authority over ANG assets. This instruction is not applicable to the Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC). For impoundment of an aircraft(s) and grounding of a Mission Design Series (MDS)
due to implementation of Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs), refer to AFI 21-101,
Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.                  Send comments and suggested
