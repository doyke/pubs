 CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) & EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU) INTERACTIONS

1.1. General. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS), the 618th Air & Space
Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) Weather Directorate, (618 AOC
(TACC)/XOW), and the 19th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (19 OSS/OSW) are
the official weather information agencies for Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. These
agencies provide weather information in support of the 19th Airlift Wing (19 AW), the 314th
Airlift Wing (314 AW), the 189th Airlift Wing (189 AW), and subordinate units and units
assigned, attached, or supported by Little Rock AFB. The 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW is
commonly referred to as TACC/XOW throughout this document. The 19 OSS/OSW is
commonly referred to as the Weather Flight (WF) and is the focal point for all weather-related
issues. This instruction will be reviewed and revised no greater than biennially or IAW with
host/parent unit procedures if the time is less than biennially. When there is a change of
command within the weather flight, the flight leadership will review this plan and local
procedures within 90 days.
   1.1.1. The 26 OWS is considered the characterization unit. Characterization encompasses
   the “collect, analyze and predict” weather core competencies. Characterization depends on
   Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate data, correctly analyze that data, and use the
   results to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space
   environment.
   1.1.2. 19 OSS/OSW and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW are considered exploitation units.
   Exploitation is the ability to minimize the impact of environmental threats to friendly forces
   while simultaneously capitalizing on environmental conditions that maximize the operational
   advantage over enemy forces. Exploitation units tailor the characterization provided by the
   characterization unit. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific mission
   profile from the overall characterization of the air and space environment. Tailoring does not
   mean changing the characterization. To the greatest extent possible exploitation units will
   use the characterized data provided to them.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 26 OWS at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, provides regional and operational-level
   weather products and information to Air Force and Army units in the Southeast region of the
   Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The 26 OWS performs a continuous
   METWATCH for Little Rock AFB. METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous process for
   monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of
   a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge
   from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product
   or group of products, and notify designated agencies.
   1.2.3. The WF and TACC/XOW are the primary source of tailored weather services in
   support of the 19 AW, the 314 AW, the 189 AW, various headquarters elements, and visiting
   aircrews. The WF and TACC/XOW will make every effort to ensure that mission-limiting
   weather is anticipated and exploited, and that safety and RP are maintained.
    6                                               LITTLEROCKAFBI15-101 28 AUGUST 2013


1.3. Responsibilities.
        1.3.1. General responsibilities of the 26 OWS and WF are outlined in AFI 15-128, para 4.1
        and para 6.2 respectively.
           1.3.1.1. The 26 OWS issues the Little Rock AFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts
           (TAFs), forecast weather warnings and watches, and may provide flight weather briefings
           to transient aircrews passing through Little Rock AFB. The OWS will issue observed
           warnings and advisories when the WF is closed.
           1.3.1.2. The WF issues all observed advisories and warnings when the WF is open.
           1.3.1.3. The WF will create Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale
           products with local mission requirements to enable the direct inject of weather impacts
           into warfighter planning and/or execution. Upon request, the WF will provide flight
           weather briefings and operational weather support for the 314 AW and 189 AW. The
           WF will provide or arrange for flight weather briefings for transient aircrews IAW the
           WF duty priorities listed in Table 1.1
           1.3.1.4. TACC/XOW. TACC/XOW provides flight weather briefings and operational
           weather support for the 19 AW.
        1.3.2. Little Rock AFB Installation Data Page. The 26 OWS and LRAFB WF will
        coordinate and maintain a LRAFB Installation Data Page detailing TAF specification and
        amendment criteria, WWA thresholds, desired lead times, mission impacts, unit information,
        Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) back-up contacts and local outage back-up information.
        1.3.3. Eyes Forward & Collaboration. The LRAFB WF will act as the eyes forward for
        the 26 OWS by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in
        coded meteorological reports to assist in forecast operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities. 19 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, para 1.3.3.1, the
WF has created the following duty priorities based on 19 AW mission requirements.

    forwarded the primary weather flight numbers to the alternate location. WF members will
    follow duty-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and evacuation checklists
    (including a list of required back-up equipment) and resume services at the AOL as soon as
    possible. The flight will continue operational 19 AW support and resume eyes forward
    responsibilities for the OWS. If access to observing sensing equipment readouts is lost,
    manual equipment will be used to take observations. Most WF services/support will be
    provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment depending on communication line
    status, equipment status, etc. Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather
    products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data services,
    including sensors and various data types (meteorological satellite (METSAT), radar imagery,
    etc.). For flight safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate during exercises.
    1.6.2. 26 OWS COOP.
       1.6.2.1. For short term outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local TAF and
       weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
       1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 26 OWS’ plan is to resume all
       support from an alternate location.
       1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, 26 OWS conducts periodic COOP
       exercises.
    1.6.3. TACC COOP.
       1.6.3.1. IAW AMCI 15-101, if the TACC/XOW loses the capability to provide flight
       weather briefing services, the WF will assume responsibility for all LRAFB Integrated
       Flight Management (IFM) and non-IFM weather packages. If the WF is unable to provide
       the required support, briefing responsibility will be transferred to the servicing OWS.
       1.6.3.2. Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Outages. In the event of a GDSS
       outage, the WF provides MWPs via DD Form 175-1 or verbal briefing. Servicing OWSs
       provide DD -175-1s via email or verbal briefing,
       1.6.3.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, TACC/XOW conducts COOP exercises
       during which the WF provides MWPs through GDSS or alternate means if a GDSS
       outage is simulated. WFs will coordinate with supported units as required.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting the Little Rock aerodrome
(defined within 5NM of the airfield) or the base as a whole.
2.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations, utilizing the FMQ-19 AMOS. Most observations are taken
automatically by the FMQ-19 with no human intervention. At times, it is necessary for a
weather forecaster to augment the system. Automated and augmentation processes are outlined
in para 2.2.7 The following observations are created and disseminated:
   2.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR observations are created
   between 45 and 59 minutes after every hour. METARs are disseminated both locally and
   long-line between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour.
   2.2.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the LRAFB special criteria listed in
   Attachment 3 have been observed or sensed. SPECI will contain all data elements found in
   a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates on data in the body of the report. All
   SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria
   are observed. Attachment 5 contains an example SPECI weather observation.
   2.2.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). During augmentation, the WF
   will take single element LOCAL observations for altimeter setting changes.
   2.2.4. Official Observing Points. The official observing point is the location of the FMQ-
   19 sensors. During periods of augmentation, the observation point will be approximately 125
   feet away from the Northwest side of building 120 (Airfield Management) as indicated by a
   North pointing arrow painted on the concrete. During relocations to the AOL, and
   augmentation is required, the observation point is in-between two concrete pads on the base
   side of the flightline access road outside of building 286.
   2.2.5. Observing Point Limitations.
      2.2.5.1. The FMQ-19 is properly sited and no limitations are currently noted.
      2.2.5.2. Augmented observations taken at the primary augmentation site (Bldg 120) are
      degraded because the observer’s view to the Northeast through Southwest is blocked by
      buildings along the flightline and thunder may not be heard due to flightline noise.
      2.2.5.3. Augmented observations taken at the AOL are degraded because view to the
      Northeast through Southwest is blocked by buildings along the flightline and thunder
      may not be heard due to flightline noise.
   2.2.6. Automated FMQ-19 Observation. An automated observation is any observation
   having been evaluated, prepared, and transmitted by an observing system without human
   intervention. In automated mode, the FMQ-19 observing system will record and disseminate
   weather observations. The FMQ-19 uses time averaging of sensor data. In an automated
   observation, sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute
 10                                            LITTLEROCKAFBI15-101 28 AUGUST 2013


   period ending at the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based
   on sensor data that is within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation.
   2.2.7. Forecaster FMQ-19 Augmentation. 2is the process of having a certified weather
   forecaster manually add or edit data to an observation generated by the FMQ-19. WF
   personnel do not augment the FMQ-19 when the airfield is closed except when tornadic
   activity is occurring or forecast to occur. The two augmentation processes used are
   supplementing and back up.
       2.2.7.1. Supplementing (definition). Manually adding meteorological information to an
       observation generated by the FMQ-19 that is beyond that system’s capability to measure
       and report. For example, the sensor cannot sense a tornado or hail.
       2.2.7.2. Supplementing procedures. WF personnel will supplement observations when
       the airfield is open and the weather conditions in Table 2.1 are observed. WF personnel
       will be ready to supplement observations if the conditions in Table 2.1 are forecast to
       occur within 1 hours. Weather personnel are required to log on to an AMOS and be
       prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic
       activity. Under these circumstances the weather flight will remain open regardless of
       whether or not the airfield is closed or will be required to re-open the office during this
       event. The weather flight will also be open to supplement when the AMOS is non-
       operational and ATC is open.

NOTES:
1. References for coding of augmentable weather conditions are located in Chapter 13 of
AFMAN 15-111.
2. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedent over any other phenomena.
3. Log on to AMOS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity anytime a weather watch
or warning has been issued for the phenomena.
4. All Remarks and Additive Data references are provided in Attachment 3 of AFMAN 15-111.
LITTLEROCKAFBI15-101 28 AUGUST 2013                                                          11


       2.2.7.3. Backup (definition). The process of manually providing meteorological data
       and/or dissemination of an FMQ-19 generated observation when the primary automated
       method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
       2.2.7.4. Backup procedures. In the event of FMQ-19 malfunction or failure, back-up
       procedures will be implemented only during airfield operating hours and/or if tornadic
       activity is occurring or forecast to occur. WF personnel will use manual observing
       procedures when performing back-up operations. When required, the WF will encode
       and disseminate METAR and SPECI observations IAW AFMAN 15-111. All element
       entries must be observed within 15 minutes of the actual time of the observation with the
       exception of wind gusts and squalls, which are reported only if they are observed within
       10 minutes of the time of the observation. When utilizing back-up equipment, all wind
       and pressure values must be estimated. ** Note: pressure values will be rounded down.
2.3. TAF Support. Little Rock AFB TAFs are produced and disseminated by the 26 OWS
IAW AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129V1, and the LRAFB Installation Data Page.
Attachment 4 lists forecast specification and amendment criteria. TAFs are valid for 30 hours,
apply to the area within the 5NM area of the LRAFB airfield complex, and will be issued at
0700, 1500, and 2300 Zulu time. Attachment 5 contains examples of typical LRAFB TAFs.
2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support & Warnings, Watches and Advisories (WWA). The
26 OWS conducts a continuous meteorological watch to identify and assess emerging and
imminent threats to LRAFB. Special Weather Statements (SWS) and Watches, Warnings, and
Advisories are special notices provided by the 26 OWS resulting from both the forecast and
METWATCH processes to assist military decision makers with resource and RP decisions.
Watches and warnings provide notice of weather events posing a hazard to life or property.
Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental phenomena with
the potential to impact operations. Customer responses to WWAs are listed in Attachment 6.
   2.4.1. SWS. SWSs are special notices issued by the 26 OWS to assist military decision
   makers with RP decisions.
   2.4.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to
   pose a hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued for a 5NM radius
   of the center point of the LRAFB runway complex and are defined in Table 2.2

   2.4.3. Weather Warnings. A special notice to notify installation personnel when an
   established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is
   occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining
   environmental threats and are used by commanders and personnel to make RP decisions and
   take protective action. Warnings are issued for a 5NM radius at the center point of the
   runway and are defined in Table 2.3
LITTLEROCKAFBI15-101 28 AUGUST 2013                                                            13

   2.4.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only observed warning
   issued for LRAFB and extends 5NM in all directions from the airfield. Lightning warnings
   are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the National Lightning
   Detection Network. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning is no longer
   observed within 5NM for at least 15 minutes. Exception: A lightning warning will not be
   cancelled if a thunderstorm is within 5NM (as indicated on radar).
   2.4.5. Observed Weather Advisories. An observed weather ADVISORY is a special
   product notifying an end user when an established environmental condition effecting
   operations is occurring or is expected to occur within a 5NM radius at the center point of the
   runway on LRAFB and are defined in Table 2.4

> 100°F or > 37.8°C
Notes:
1. Crosswinds are calculated based on the maximum observed wind speed (to include gusts) and
worst case observed direction including variability.

   2.4.6. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
   consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
   followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
   second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
   Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
   in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
   and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
   are contained in Attachment 5.
   2.4.7. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from
   35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
   times specified in Tables 2.3 and 2.4. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time
   (and will include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast tornado warnings
   and/or observed lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate warnings. With
   the exception of tornado and lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for one criteria and it
   becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning and new number will be
   issued, to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be specified for each
   criteria if necessary.
   2.4.8. WWA Amendments. When WWAs no longer adequately describe the phenomenon's
   expected occurrence, a completely new WWA with a new number will be issued. The
   amendment will clearly state how the amendment or extension affects any previously issued
   notices.
   2.4.9. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to
   the expiration of the original notice.
   2.4.10. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are canceled when the weather
   phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings not extended or canceled
   will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled
LITTLEROCKAFBI15-101 28 AUGUST 2013                                                              15


   when the criteria is no longer occurring and have not occurred in the last 30 minutes. See
   para 2.4.4 for cancellation of observed lightning warnings.
2.5. Dissemination Process.
   2.5.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the FMQ-19 automated observing system
   or the weather technician are disseminated via JET. When JET is nonoperational, the WF
   will relay observations to the following local organizations in order of priority listed in Table
   2.5.

2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The WF and ATC have established a CWW as
required by AFI 13-204V3 and AFMAN 15-111. The agreement outlines each unit’s
responsibilities when specific meteorological phenomena are observed. Of primary concern is
the report of tower visibility differing from the prevailing surface visibility, local PIREPs, and
any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be
critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources. All WF technicians
must thoroughly understand and be able to execute every element in the local cooperative
weather watch agreement.

                                          Chapter 5

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses the FMQ-19 and WSR-88D weather radar to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems provide customers the most
timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence possible. Note: TMQ-53 is a tactical
automated observing system that is used by the WF during contingency and exercise operations.
The TMQ-53 provides a capability that is very similar to the FMQ-19.
   5.2.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and
   direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent
   precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion during freezing precipitation. These
   measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that
   comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and military
   reporting standards.
   5.2.2. WSR-88D. The WF utilizes the WSR-88D as its primary source of radar data.
   Weather technicians make use of an Open Principle User Processor (OPUP) to analyze
   complex radar signatures and obtain detailed information on storm intensity, movement,
   internal circulation, and general wind flow. Weather technicians will routinely incorporate
   the latest radar information into all mission execution forecasts and RP products.
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems are the backbone of the WF
communications network:
   5.3.1. JET. As discussed in para 2.5 of this instruction, JET is the primary system for
   disseminating forecast, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used
   as a backup for key aircraft controlling agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (239.8 MHz) allows the WF to communicate with
   aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. If the PMSV is out-of-
   service, aircrews can contact Little Rock AFB Weather at 239.8 MHz, TACC/XOW or the
   OWS via phone patch (where possible) to get weather data.
   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to serve for backup services.
   5.3.4. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers.

5.4. Maintenance.

Table 5.1. identifies which organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair
weather and communications equipment.

Table 5.1. Equipment Maintenance List.

19 CS/SCOI (Telephone/Network Systems)                    Phones/Hotlines/LAN/Internet

   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems exist the event natural
   disasters or any other anomaly, simultaneously impacting systems base wide. Significant
   indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative, while minimal means
   the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment are listed in
   Table 5.2 below (priorities may be adjusted based on forecasted weather):

LITTLEROCKAFBI15-101 28 AUGUST 2013                                                         39


A4.1. Type of Report. METAR or SPECI.
A4.2. Station identifier, also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
observation (in this case Little Rock AFB).
A4.3. Date and Time of Report. This is in Zulu (GMT) of the last element of the observation.
A4.4. Report Modifier. The report modifier can be either of the following two elements:
   A4.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or SPECI
   is transmitted.
   A4.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human intervention.
       A4.4.2.1. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician signs
       off the AMOS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
       A4.4.2.2. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term COR is
       used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather technician is
       manually correcting the observation.
A4.5. Wind. The true direction the wind is blowing from is encoded in tens of degrees using
three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." The wind speed is
entered as a two or three digit group immediately following the wind direction.
   A4.5.1. Gust. The wind gust is encoded in two or three digits immediately following the
   wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in whole knots using the units and tens digits and, if
   required, the hundreds digit.
   A4.5.2. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction with
   wind speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the direction.
   A4.5.3. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction varying
   60 degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded. The variable wind
   direction group will immediately follow the wind group. The directional variability will be
   encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind is variable from 180 degrees to
   240 degrees at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
   A4.5.4. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
A4.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) seen from
the airfield reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported is 7 miles.
A4.7. Runway Visual Range.
A4.8. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon occurring on the airfield. This is mandatory
anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A4.2 lists the present weather codes:

A4.9. Sky Condition and Cloud Height. Describes the amount of clouds present at the airfield
and the base of each cloud deck. They fall into the following categories:
   A4.9.1. SKC – Sky Clear.
   A4.9.2. FEW – 1/8 to 2/8 coverage.
   A4.9.3. SCT – Scattered; 3/8 to 4/8 coverage.
   A4.9.4. BKN – Broken; 5/8 to 7/8 coverage.
   A4.9.5. OVC – Overcast; 8/8 coverage.
   A4.9.6. VV – Vertical visibility; normally used during heavy fog, indicates how far up into
   the fog can be seen.
   A4.9.7. FEW000 – Surface-based obscuration.
   A4.9.8. Cloud Height. Three-digit number provides the height of the base of the cloud in
   hundreds of feet (e.g., 015 equals 1,500 feet). The CB and TCU descriptors may be
   appended to the cloud height to indicate the cloud is a cumulonimbus or towering cumulus.
A4.10. Temperature and Dew Point (i.e., can be in degrees, either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
