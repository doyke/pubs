                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. A team comprised of the 21st Operational Support Squadron’s Weather Flight
(OSS/OSW) and the 25 Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) located at Davis Monthan AFB,
Arizona, provides weather support to the 21st Space Wing (21 SW) and associate units assigned
or attached to Peterson AFB (PAFB) and Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (CMAFS) along
with the NORAD-NORTHCOM Command Center (N2C2). Basic concepts and procedures are
outlined in Air Force and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) directives, instructions and
manuals. This document establishes requirements and procedures for areas of weather support
that must be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather
support requirements and procedures for garrison operations, but does not cover procedures for
emergency war operations or other special operations/procedures that are covered in applicable
base plans and instructions.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. Air Force Weather Organization. In accordance with (IAW) the CSAF-approved
   Strategic Plan for Air Force Weather (AFW) Reengineering dated 8 Aug 97, AFW developed
   an integrated weather support structure in order to ensure weather operations were conducted
   at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels in an effort to provide more meaningful
   environmental information, products and data to operational customers. According to AFI
   15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities, dated 7 Feb 11, as part of the joint
   team, AFW forces deliver accurate, consistent, relevant and timely environmental
   information, products and services, anywhere in the world. Executing the core competencies
   to collect, analyze, predict, tailor, and proactively integrate environmental threat information
   into commanders’ decision cycles and Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
   Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, AFW forces enable
   commanders at all levels to anticipate, mitigate the impact of, and exploit the weather;
   optimizing air, space, cyberspace and ground operations to the advantage of allied objectives
   and the detriment of the adversary.
   1.2.2. Operational Weather Squadrons. IAW AFI 15-128, OWS are responsible for the
   collection of atmospheric data/information, analysis and prediction of the atmosphere and
   generation of products based on this analysis and prediction for use by Weather Flights
   (WFs) and other agencies. As such, the 25 OWS, will provide regional and operational-level
   weather products and information to Air Force and Army units in the Western Region of the
   Continental United States to include the 21 OSS/OSW.
   1.2.3. Weather Flights. IAW AFI 15-128, the primary purpose of the WF is to facilitate the
   exploitation of the environment through integration into every phase of operations-planning
   and execution processes. WFs assess the mission environment to determine environmental
   threats, and where possible, find alternatives to mitigate those threats. Each flight has unique
   characteristics and functions based on its parent/host unit’s mission, geographic location and
   level of command. WFs support the entire spectrum of Air Force, Army and Special
   Operations’ Active and Reserve Component mission types including but not limited to:
   aviation and ground operations conducted at home station and deployed locations. WFs are
 8                                                       21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


     also responsible to support other parent/host unit operations where success may depend on
     mitigation of environmental threats. WF functions include the Staff Integration function,
     Mission Integration function and Airfield Support function. As such, the 21 OSS/OSW will
     act as the Lead Weather Unit (LWU) for all tactical-level weather support required at PAFB
     and CMAFS.
1.3. Responsibilities. General responsibilities of AFW organizations are outlined in AFI 15-
128. Specific responsibilities of the 25 OWS, in regards to the support provided to the 21
OSS/OSW, are outlined in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the 21 OSS/OSW
and 25 OWS (known as the Peterson AFB Data Page) and this Instruction. The 25 OWS
provides timely, accurate and relevant weather products as follows: weather warnings, watches,
and advisories; regional and operational-level weather products; tactical-level weather products;
limited Pilot-to-Metro (PMSV) support during non-duty hours; and flight weather briefings to
transient aircrews passing through Peterson AFB during non-duty hours or times of increased
operations tempo. The WF will issue all observed advisories and warnings (during duty hours)
and create tailored weather products focused on the local mission. Additionally, the WF will
support the base in thoroughly educating agencies on the purpose, applicability and operating
procedures of weather products in reference to Emergency Management Planning Operations as
outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities.
     1.4.1. 25 OWS Duty Priorities. The 25 OWS duty priorities listed in Tables 1.1.and 1.2.
     exist to match and balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities focus
     efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts. Weather
     operators will use good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially when
     there is imminent danger to life, limb and/or property.

1.5. Operational Hours. 21 OSS/OSW Staff services, outlined in Chapter 5 of this instruction,
are available during normal duty hours (0730L-1630L) or as required (e.g., Staff Briefings,
Exercises, etc.).
   1.5.1. 25 OWS. 25 OWS Weather Forecasters are on duty 24-hours a day, 7 days a week
   and 25 OWS staff services are available from 0730L-1630L Monday through Friday (with
   the exception of federal holidays or approved closures).
   1.5.2. Aviation Operations Element. 21 OSS/OSW Aviation Operations Element forecasters
   are available from 0600L to 2200L Monday through Friday and Guard/Reserve weekends
   with the exception of federal holidays or approved airfield closures. See Chapter 3 of this
   Instruction for Aviation Operations Services.
   1.5.3. NORAD-NORTHCOM (N-NC) Weather Support Element (WSE). 21 OSS/OSW N-
   NC forecasters are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. See Chapter 4 of this Instruction
   for N-NC WSE Services.
1.6. Assumptions, Shortfalls and Limitations.
   1.6.1. 25 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
   execute the MOA and sufficient weather intelligence will be available from various sources
   on which to base weather operations and production.
   1.6.2. 21 OSS/OSW Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate
   facilities, funding, equipment, communications, personnel and indigenous support (e.g.,
   water, power, etc.) are available.
   1.6.3. 21 OSS/OSW Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available due to WF
   staffing, station evacuation or other higher priority missions.
21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                11


   1.6.4. 21 OSS/OSW Limitations.
      1.6.4.1. Observing Limitations. WF personnel are not a part of the observing process. A
      fixed based weather observation system (FMQ-22), located at CMAFS, is owned and
      operated by the WF, but due to its location (more than 8 miles from PAFB weather
      operations), these observations are not augmented. The National Weather Service
      (NWS) owns and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates the Automated
      Surface Observing System (ASOS) at PAFB. This ASOS takes and disseminates
      observations 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. This system is augmented by FAA
      owned certified weather observers 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. This system is
      programmed to take and disseminate Special Observations based on FAA/NWS criteria.
      These criterions differ from Air Force Weather (AFW) Special Observation Criteria.
      1.6.4.2. Lightning. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor
      visibility. Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise. The WF owns and
      operates a dedicated Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network System. If this
      system becomes inoperable for any reason, our back-up is the Air Force Weather-Web
      Services (AFW-WEBS).          AFW-WEBS lightning display functionality is highly
      dependent on the capabilities of PAFBs Local Area Network (LAN) and is therefore not
      100% dependable.
   1.6.5. PMSV Limitations. The PMSV frequency at PAFB is 226.1 MHz. In the event of an
   outage, pilots can reach weather personnel via the PAFB Airfield Operations via their
   frequency (372.2 MHz). Pilots may be unable to gain weather information from a back-up
   source in the event of a power outage, inoperative radio, etc. and would therefore rely on a
   phone patch. Additionally, PMSV support provided by the 25 OWS is currently only
   available through phone patch.
   1.6.6. Climatological Limitations.       The WF maintains only limited historical and
   climatological information; therefore, requests beyond the WF records will require additional
   time for processing. Requests for climatological information can also be submitted through
   the 14 Weather Squadron webpage (https://www.afccc.af.mil/).
1.7. Alternate/Back-up Operating Location (AOL).
   1.7.1. Real-World Evacuation. In the event of a real-world building evacuation, all
   personnel will move to either the short-term evacuation location (pavilion across the street
   from Bldg 122), or the long-term alternate operating location (Bldg 845, OSO Flight, Rm
   115, DSN 834-3017/COM 719-556-3017, Fax DSN 834-6850/COM 719-556-6850). In the
   event of a Shelter-In-Place scenario, all personnel will move to the N-NC WSE (Bldg 122,
   Rm 114) or the men’s bathroom on the 1st floor of Bldg 122, as appropriate.
      1.7.1.1. The current AOL affords the WF with limited operational capability as the
      primary operating location.
      1.7.1.2. WF personnel will follow duty specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
      and Weather Flight Evacuation Checklists in order to resume services at the alternate
      location as soon as possible. Some WF services/support will be provided, but will
      require a case-by-case assessment dependent upon communication line status, equipment
      status, etc. Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot
 12                                                       21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


       briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data services, including
       various data types (Lightning Detection, etc.).
   1.7.2. Exercise Evacuations. For flight safety reasons the WF will not evacuate for
   exercises, but will ensure all personnel are certified/re-certified on evacuation and back-up
   procedures on an annual basis. See Chapter 10 of this Instruction for further details on back-
   up procedures.
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies and
Individuals. Except as authorized by 21 SW Public Affairs, non-DOD organizations and
individuals will be referred to other government or private weather information services for
weather data (e.g., local NWS). Any questions/clarifications will be coordinated through the WF
Commander and/or Flight Chief.
   1.8.1. Weather requests by foreign nationals must be coordinated with AF Scientific and
   Technical Information officers before being fulfilled by the WF.
1.9. Post-Mission Analysis/Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129V2, Chapter 2, units that regularly
utilize weather support from the WF will provide post-mission/utilization feedback, when
possible. This information will be used to ensure proper Quality Assurance (QA) and to provide
a metrics database. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
   1.9.1. Transient weather brief feedback forms provided with completed Mission Weather
   Products (MWP).
   1.9.2. Feedback forms accompanying all faxed MWPs.
   1.9.3. Emails to WF leadership (21oss.osw.workflow@us.af.mil).
   1.9.4. Phone calls to WF leadership.
   1.9.5. Routing through the base mail system.
   1.9.6. Face to face feedback following any briefing.
   1.9.7. The WF will, in turn, utilize this data to refine their mission support role and gauge
   unit strengths and weaknesses. Representative sample sizes are necessary to accurately
   reflect the satisfaction with and accuracy of the weather support being provided to Peterson’s
   flying units by the WF. At least one feedback submission per day is desired.
1.10. Mishap Procedures. In the event of an aircraft mishap or emergency, the WF, OWS and
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) are all involved. In general, the WF will ensure applicable
data used in the development of any weather information, product and/or service provided are
saved for an investigation (to include MWPs, space weather products, mission impact slides,
etc.). The WF will save enough data before and after the mishap to fully reconstruct
environmental conditions. The WF will coordinate with the 25 OWS and/or AFWA to save all
applicable data and products that were used in preparing MWPs. NOTE: Duplication of saved
data between the WF and AFWA is not required. The WF will also coordinate with the 25 OWS
to initiate a data save for OWS-produced/provided products used in preparing MWPs. If the WF
used products from other OWSs to support missions crossing AORs, they must coordinate with
all applicable OWSs to initiate a data save. If the OWS provided MWPs, they will coordinate

AFMAN 15-129V2, Chapter 3.5.
1.11. Utilization of Weather Station Personnel. IAW AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe
Weather Events, the Installation Commander will ensure weather personnel are available to
perform their weather responsibilities and should not be tasked for additional or temporary duties
not related to weather (i.e., security forces augmentees, squadron safety manager, etc.).
Providing “eyes forward” support and base resource protection has a higher priority of duty than
assignment to base details and additional duties out of the weather facility. Therefore, agencies
wishing to task personnel from the WF must coordinate at least one month in advance with the
WF CC or NCOIC as to their ability to support the tasking. NOTE: If weather personnel are
tasked for additional duties not related to weather, WF leadership reserves the right to “pull”
tasked individuals during severe weather events.
1.12. Records Management. The WF will maintain and dispose of records IAW the Air Force

                                  AVIATION OPERATIONS

3.1. General. The Aviation Operations Element (AOE) provides services which include those
actions that affect the Peterson aerodrome or base as a whole in an effort to reliably inject timely,
accurate, and relevant environmental information at every decision point in the mission planning
and execution process--optimizing mission success. MWPs are the primary tools used to
accomplish these tasks. MWPs are tailored to individual customer requirements. Any event,
both flying and non-flying, that will be affected by weather normally requires some sort of
MWP.
3.2. Operational Hours. Most AOE services, like flying MWPs, are only required during
normal duty and/or flying hours. The WF will have at least one person dedicated to Aviation
Operations during normal duty hours. As needed, the WF will make every effort to man the
AOE during non-standard times to support local flying missions (ex., Guard/Reserve flying
weekends). The AOE forecast counter is open Monday through Friday from 0600L until 2200L
(no forecaster on duty on weekends, federal holidays, and/or approved airfield closures). The
AOE forecaster can be contacted by phone at DSN 834-4337/COMM 719-556-4337 or by fax at
DSN 834-4169/COMM 719-556-4169.
   3.2.1. There will be a WF standby forecaster available at all times who will man the WF
   outside of “normal” operating hours mentioned in paragraph 3.2. This forecaster will man
   the WF as appropriate for severe weather support. Standby personnel will be recalled by the
   Peterson Command Post (CP). Recall will be initiated when the 25 OWS issues a severe
   watch or warning. Standby personnel will also be available for mission requirements of
   which a remote briefing from the OWS will not suffice.
3.3. Mission Weather Products. MWPs are essentially mission-specific forecasts that are
developed using the Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP), outlined in AFMAN 15-
129V2, and may be provided through various methods (verbally; person-to-person; DD Form
175-1, Flight Weather Briefing; etc.). During this process, the WF will fuse and tailor strategic
and theater scale products, as well as information supplied by local units (e.g., flying schedule)
and agencies in an effort to enable the direct injection of weather impacts into mission planning
and execution. The end result is a product/information designed to provide timely, accurate, and
relevant weather intelligence to various customers by whatever means proves most effective.
MWPs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by
OWSs and AFWA. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies or when
conditions threaten resource protection, the WF will amend MWPs to accurately reflect
conditions and back-brief the 25 OWS as time permits.
3.4. Flight MWPs. AOE forecasters will provide verbal or traditional MWPs (Flight Weather
Briefings/DD Form 175-1) to aircrews as requested and following the AOEs duty priorities listed
in Table 1.2. of this Instruction. Briefings for PAFB aircrews departing from PAFB will be
provided by the WF between 0600L and 2200L. Briefings for PAFB aircrews outside this time-
frame must be coordinated with the WF in advance. Briefings will be either at the AOE forecast
counter located in building 122 or via email, fax and/or telephone. AOE personnel require a 2
hour notice prior to briefing request time to allow for the proper preparation of the MWP. Out-
 22                                                     21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


of-station mass briefings for special missions require 48 hours advanced notice are subject to
staffing availability and must be coordinated with WF leadership at DSN 834-7624/COMM 719-
556-7624 or via email (21oss.osw.ex@us.af.mil). Transient aircrews departing PAFB will
receive MWPs from their home station WF, the 25 OWS or the PAFB WF (as time permits and
IAW Duty Priorities). The 25 OWS can be contacted by phone (DSN 228-6598/6599/6588) or
via web access (https://ows.dm.af.mil/ then under “Operations” and “Request Briefing”). The
transient aircrew weather briefing area located in bldg 122 can be used to obtain briefings from
the home WF or OWS.
3.5. Follow-Up Support. Customers are welcome to contact the WF for any post-mission
information and/or follow-up support. Feedback information is available in Chapter 1.9. of this
Instruction.
3.6. Mission-Scale Meteorological Watch (MISSIONWATCH). MISSIONWATCH is
defined as a deliberate process of monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment for
specific mission-limiting environmental factors that may adversely impact missions in execution.
   3.6.1. The MISSIONWATCH process will be performed by the PAFB WF and is intended
   to identify previously unidentified environmental threats and alert decision-makers at the
   operational unit and/or airborne mission commanders, enabling dynamic changes to mission
   profiles that may mitigate the environmental threat and optimize the chance of mission
   success. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources (Meteorological Satellite
   [METSAT], Weather Radar, Websites, etc.) may be utilized to accomplish this task. It is
   through this method that MWP amendments and updates are accomplished. During rapidly
   changing weather, the WF will amend or update the MWP as required and contact the
   owning Supervisor of Flying (SOF) to pass on critical changes. Significant changes include,
   but are not limited to: hazards not briefed, destination and alternates reflecting Mission
   Limiting Thresholds (MLT) conditions not previously briefed, any Pilot Reports (PIREPs)
   received along the route which contain hazards not briefed on departure, etc.
3.7. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). METWATCH is defined as a deliberate process
for monitoring the terrestrial weather or space environment in an area or region. The purpose is
to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions
and determine courses of action to update or amend the forecast product or group of products and
notify designated agencies.
   3.7.1. This process provides an organized approach for PAFB weather personnel to maintain
   situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation at PAFB and CMAFS.
   This process involves notifying supported units and updating forecast products when pre-
   established weather conditions change or are forecast to change (timing, location or forecast
   values). All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources (METSAT, weather radar,
   websites, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] Weather Radio, etc.)
   may be used to accomplish this task. 25 OWS personnel will perform a continuous Terminal
   METWATCH for PAFB with WF personnel acting as the “eyes forward” for the 25 OWS by
   providing immediate feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in weather
   conditions. The 25 OWS will also perform Flight and Route METWATCH for transient
   flights they briefed and which departed from PAFB. The WF will perform Flight and Route
   METWATCH for transient flights departing PAFB that were briefed by WF personnel.
   3.7.2. At a minimum, METWATCH procedures will consist of the following:
21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                      23


       3.7.2.1. WF personnel will monitor conditions at PAFB, CMAFS, The Air Force
       Academy, and Fort Carson; 25 OWS and the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) hazard
       charts; radar data; Space Weather forecasts; Significant Meteorological Information
       (SIGMET); PIREPs and Lightning Detection System (LDS).
       3.7.2.2. WF personnel will METWATCH for watch, warning and advisory criteria as
       outlined in Chapter 7 of this instruction.
       3.7.2.3. When forecast conditions change during METWATCH, WF personnel will
       notify the 25 OWS PAFB duty forecaster at DSN 228-6674.
3.8. “Eyes Forward” Process/Procedure. This process/procedure is the WFs role in allowing
for the integration of weather data, METSAT imagery, lightning detection readouts and non-
standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather picture and near-term forecast for
the OWS. The WF provides meaningful meteorological information not contained in the coded
observations to the 25 OWS as an integral part of the METWATCH process (phone calls, emails,
etc.). Additionally, the WF integrates the current state of the atmosphere into an understanding
of future impacts on forecast conditions and communicates these impacts and/or information to
the 25 OWS as needed.
3.9. Airfield Observations. The FAA is responsible for weather observations for PAFB and the
City of Colorado Springs Municipal Airport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.
The airfield’s primary observing system is an ASOS that forms and disseminates Meteorological
Aviation Routine (METAR), Special (SPECI), and local observations IAW FAA Order (FAAO)
7900.5C, Surface Weather Observing. FAA SPECI observation criteria is outlined in Attachment
7 of this Instruction. A certified FAA Observer augments the ASOS data and provides manual
backup when required. Specifics regarding maintenance and sustainment of this ASOS will be
outlined further in Chapter 9.4. of this Instruction.
   3.9.1. Observation Limitations.
       3.9.1.1. Instrumentation at KCOS does not exist to provide Runway Visual Range
       (RVR) information on observation and therefore, special observations for changes in
       RVR are not taken.
           3.9.1.1.1. Runway condition measurements are taken by city operations personnel
           and transmitted to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower and PAFB Airfield
           Operations, but the information is not included on METAR and SPECI observations.
       3.9.1.2. SPECI Observation Reporting Requirements. The observer augmented ASOS
       takes, records, and disseminates SPECI observations to report significant changes in
       weather elements. IAW FAAO 7900.5C, SPECIs must be taken when specified criteria
       are observed. Since FAA Weather Observing requirements differ from USAF Weather
       Observing requirements, SPECI criteria and observations will not be the same as
       traditional USAF Weather Observations.
           3.9.1.2.1. FAA ATC tower personnel add a visibility element to the observation
           when either the surface prevailing visibility or the tower visibility is less than 4 miles.
           This criterion is not considered SPECI criteria by FAAO 7900.5C.
 24                                                      21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


           3.9.1.2.2. A SPECI observation is produced for real-world mishaps and/or
           emergencies and an “ACFT MSHP” will be included in the remarks section of the
           observation.
3.10. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations,
Chapter 2.14.1, PAFB weather personnel will conduct a BWW. The BWW is conducted
because, due to other duties, a weather operator cannot monitor the weather continuously and
therefore cannot detect and report all weather changes as they occur. Essentially, this is a
process by which we routinely monitor weather conditions. Weather personnel will recheck
weather conditions at least every 20 minutes when any of the following are observed to be
occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour. NOTE: Even though WF personnel are not
responsible for the official observation at PAFB and are not specifically required by AFMAN
15-111 to perform BWW duties, personnel will perform this function in an effort to maintain
environmental awareness.
   3.10.1. Ceiling forms or dissipates below, decreases to less than or, if below increases to
   equal or exceeds 1,500 feet.
   3.10.2. Visibility decreases to less than or, if below, increases to equal or exceeds 3 statute
   miles (SM).
   3.10.3. Precipitation (any form).
   3.10.4. Fog or mist.
   3.10.5. Thunderstorms or lightning within 5 nautical miles (NM) of PAFB.
   3.10.6. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will remain
   alert for any other changes in weather conditions. Weather technicians will also monitor
   local area observational and forecast products as often as necessary to keep abreast of
   changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
3.11. Cooperative Weather Watch. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) is the process by
which FAA personnel (ATC and Wx Observer), SOF, flying units, and Security Forces (SF)
personnel report changes in weather conditions to the duty weather technician (556-4337). Of
primary concern is the occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect
flight safety or which could be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and
resources. CWW inherently dictates close contact between the PAFB WF and the previously
mentioned organizations and/or personnel. WF leadership will be responsible for ensuring
CWW compliance by coordinating with associated CWW unit leadership. Further detail on unit
responsibilities is outlined in Chapter 11 (Reciprocal Support) of this Instruction.
3.12. Pilot-to-Metro Service. Weather information is available during normal duty hours on
frequency 226.1 MHz to provide aircrews with operational weather support. For aircraft outside
the range of the PAFB PMSV system or when the AOE forecast counter is closed, the 25 OWS
can provide PMSV support through a phone patch (DSN 228-6598/COMM 520-228-6598,
option 1). As a backup, aircrews can contact PAFB for PMSV support through the 21 OSS/OSA
(Airfield Operations) Pilot to Dispatch (PTD) radio frequency (372.2 MHz).
   3.12.1. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, Air and Space Weather Operations - Exploitation, WF
   forecasters will request PIREPs during all PMSV contacts.
21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                25


   3.12.2. The WF will disseminate PIREPs locally when they reflect operationally significant
   weather within 50 NM of PAFB (reports of any icing, turbulence, low-level wind shear,
   thunderstorm activity, tops/bases of clouds, flight visibility, and obstructions to vision).
   PIREPs will be disseminated long-line IAW AFMAN 15-124.
3.13. Planning Weather. WF personnel will provide planning weather forecasts and solar/lunar
data upon request. NOTE: Beyond the 5-7 day forecast period, climatological averages will be
provided for the requested time-frame based on the inaccuracies inherent in computerized
models beyond this period. This climatology consists of average seasonal values from past
occurrences.
3.14. Exercise/Crisis Weather Support. During crises or wing/base exercises, the WF will
provide weather data upon request.
   3.14.1. Chemical Downwind Message (CDM). WF personnel will provide CDM support
   during aerial chemical events, upon request by CE Readiness personnel, the On-Scene
   Commander, or a member of the Crisis Action Team. If necessary, the message will be
   decoded by WF personnel.
   3.14.2. Effective Downwind Message (EDM). WF personnel will provide EDM support
   during exercise or real-world nuclear fallout events, upon request by crisis management
   personnel. If necessary, the message will be decoded by WF personnel.
   3.14.3. Limitations. Current weather data provided by the WF is valid only at the ASOS
   sensor suite located on the airfield. Weather parameters for a specific area not located near
   the airfield will be estimated by WF personnel unless on-scene emergency responders are
   equipped with their own reliable weather observation equipment.
3.15. Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs). WF personnel are not equipped to support TDA
requests. Contact the 25 OWS PAFB forecaster at DSN 228-7655 to request this type of support.
3.16. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Index (WBGTI). WBGTI is a predictor of physiological
strain in hot environments. It takes into account the effects of humidity, air speed, air
temperature and the radiant heating factor (from the sun).
   3.16.1. The 21 SW Bio-Environmental Flight will calculate and disseminate the WBGTI to
   the PAFB Fitness Center. This information is disseminated from 0800L to 1630L Monday
   through Friday.    The PAFB Fitness Center will provide back-up calculation and
   dissemination on weekends and holiday, as required.
 26                                                      21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013

   follow-on assessments on an as needed basis. NOTE: If time permits, N-NC WSE duty
   forecaster will coordinate these assessments with Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC)
   Weather Specialty Team (WST) and the AFWA Space Weather Branch. If time does not
   permit, the duty forecaster will back-brief JSpOC and AFWA Space when time does permit.
   4.4.3. An impact analysis, along with the assessment conclusion, will be coordinated with
   the JSpOC WST and the AFWA Space Weather Branch for cross-feed to AFSPC/A3SF.
21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   27


4.5. Crew Changeover Briefings. WF personnel no longer participate in the N2C2 Crew
Changeover Briefing, but must maintain situational awareness of specific environmental events
that could have an impact on N-NC personnel, resources, and/or missions. At a minimum, WF
personnel will remain cognizant of the following:
   4.5.1. Tropical Systems (depressions, storms, hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones) could
   potentially impact N-NC operations or support locations.
   4.5.2. Launch weather forecasts from the Eastern and Western Test Range for scheduled

notification of the following events to N2C2 and other participating agencies via the Ops Loop
or via telephone:
   4.7.1. Solar radio burst, proton and/or x-ray events. Event notifications will be disseminated
   within 15 minutes of notification by AFWA/2nd Weather Squadron (2WS) when events
   exceed operationally prescribed levels and when they drop below those levels.
   4.7.2. Geomagnetic events will be disseminated within the cardinal hour of the event.
   Notifications will be made when geomagnetic activity exceeds and subsequently drops below
   operationally prescribed levels.
   4.7.3. When ducted clutter or radio wave anomalous propagation forecasts exceed
   operationally prescribed levels for specific ground-based surveillance radars, notification will
   be made to the Missile and Space Domain IAW N-NC Support Element SOPs.
 28                                                    21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


4.8. Continuous METWATCH. WF personnel will provide accurate and timely notification of
the following events to N2C2 and other participating agencies via the Ops Loop, internet chat

5.4. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Briefings. The WF will provide IRC briefings as
required by course scheduling IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program, and
AFMAN 15-129. The weather portion of the briefing consists of an overview of the WFs
Aviation Operations, WF capabilities, WF and OWS responsibilities, resource protection,
seasonal/regional weather, space weather impacts and procedures for obtaining weather support
at other locations.
5.5. Crisis Action Team Briefings. The WF will provide weather briefings as required for
CAT meetings. This includes exercise, real-world emergency management incidents, etc. Each
briefing will be tailored to provide the appropriate weather intelligence required by wing
leadership. PAFB Base Support Plan 10-404 outlines specifics on Emergency/Crisis Action
Response as well as Force Protection and Emergency Actions resulting from weather
events/natural disasters.
5.6. Pre-Deployment Planning. The WF will brief all available weather information to include
forecasts and climatology for the local area, Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE), Area of
Responsibility (AOR) and Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)/Final Destination (DEST) at the
deployment concept briefing. If there is no concept briefing, the WF will relay information to
the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) and/or Deployment Control Center (DCC) as
requested.
5.7. Climatology Briefings. Climatology information will be provided as requested.
Additionally, monthly climatology will be presented at Wing Staff Meetings and/or OpsIntel
Briefings on the first briefing of the month.
5.8. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
ensuring all weather information in the FLIP is accurate. All weather related updates will be
requested through the Airfield Operations FLIP Manager (Airfield Management). The Flip
Manager will process the information to AFFSA/OL-D. Updates will fall in one of three
categories: revisions, changes or corrections.
5.9. Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) Support. The 21 SW has numerous GSUs located
around the world. WF leadership will act as liaison between 21 SW GSUs and the appropriate
supporting weather unit (OWS, NWS, etc.).
 30                                                      21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


   5.9.1. The WF is not manned or equipped to provide direct support to 21 SW GSUs.
   5.9.2. WF leadership will provide limited situational awareness overview of 21 SW GSU
   mission limiting weather for 21 SW leadership during weekly briefings (OpsIntel, Staff
   Meetings, etc.).
5.10. Thule AB, Greenland. The PAFB WF acts as the Functional Area Manager (FAM) for
the weather portion of the Thule AB support contract. As such, the Thule Weather FAM acts as
the subject matter expert for all issues relating to the weather portion of the contract, weather

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Many PAFB/CMAFS/USAF communications systems use sky wave and
transionospheric propagation (High Frequency [HF], Very High Frequency [VHF], Ultra High
Frequency [UHF] and Satellite Communications [SATCOM]); which can be rendered useless by
electromagnetic radiation from our sun. This chapter contains information regarding space
weather limitations, alerts and warnings and products available to Peterson personnel.
6.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a
lack of sensors/data. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, our ability to provide
useful lead-times for significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. Broad coverage CONUS-based space weather
products (graphical, text, global and regional products as well as tutorials) are available at
https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Weather+Main+Page or
the 25 OWS web page. These products will be used to update the space weather portion (HF and
UHF) of the MWP and/or the appropriate block of the DD Form 175-1. Additionally, Space
Weather Impacts should be reported through the appropriate link on the Space Weather Home
Page. See Attachment 6 for a detailed description of specific Space Weather products and
descriptions.
6.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from AFW-WEBS. Most Space
Weather products from the strategic center are “now-casts” and/or very short-term forecasts (6-
hourly periods); therefore WF forecasters must check websites for updated products at least
twice throughout their shift and update the MWP accordingly. Descriptions of specific Space
Weather products are outlined on the AFW-WEBS Space Weather website at
https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Events+and+Impacts+Product+
Help
   6.4.1. GPS Products. GPS products are primarily “now-casts” and/or <1 hourly forecast.
   Due to the frequent refresh rate of these products, WF forecasters will only monitor these
   products when specifically requested by the customer.

                                           Chapter 7

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

7.1. General. Certain weather conditions endanger property or life, pose a safety hazard or
adversely impact operations. This chapter contains details on how the WF/OWS team monitors
these phenomena and issues weather watches, warnings and advisories (WWA) for significant
events that are occurring or are expected to occur.
7.2. Resource protection for both PAFB and CMAFS is accomplished through a joint
effort between the 25 OWS and the PAFB WF. The 25 OWS is responsible for issuing all
forecasted weather watches and warnings. The WF acts as the “eyes forward” for the 25 OWS
and is responsible for issuing all observed warnings and advisories (annotated in Integrated
Weather Warning Capability [IWWC] or on the appropriate back-up forms: AF Form 3806,
Weather Watch Advisory Log, and AF Form 3807, Watch/Warning Notification and
Verification). NOTE: The WF can issue any forecasted warning if there is an immediate threat
to life and/or property. In these cases, the WF will back-brief the OWS when time permits and
will also be responsible for dissemination to local supported agencies. Conversely, the WF will
act as the alternate dissemination/notification source for the OWS. The goal is to provide the
best possible resource protection to PAFB and CMAFS.
   7.2.1. Commanders must be familiar with WWA criteria that affect their operations or
   personnel and ensure that the notification is passed to the lowest level in their unit that may
   require the notification for personnel safety and resource protection.
   7.2.2. Weather watches, warnings and advisories are disseminated by the OWS or WF via
   the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) IWWC Portal IAW WF WWA SOPs. See
   Attachment 3 for specific product format and interpretation.
7.3. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.,
tornadoes, hail, etc.). It provides advanced notification of the POTENTIAL for weather
conditions that could pose a hazard to life or property for which the customer must take
protective actions. Watches are issued for a 5 NM radius of PAFB and CMAFS.
   7.3.1. The OWS issues weather watches for PAFB and CMAFS. Watches normally precede
   warnings.
   7.3.2. All units on PAFB and CMAFS will, at a minimum, review their protective action
   procedures when watches are issued.

   7.3.3. Table 7.1. Contains all of the weather watches and desired lead-times issued for
   PAFB.

 Action Procedures outlined in Chapter 7.7. of this Instruction.


7.4. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather event, of such intensity to pose a threat to life or property (such
as lightning, tornadoes, etc.), is EXPECTED TO OCCUR or is OCCURRING. Warnings are
issued for a 5 NM radius of PAFB and CMAFS.
 34                                                      21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


   7.4.1. The OWS issues weather warnings for PAFB and CMAFS (with the exception of the
   observed lightning warnings that are issued by the WF when personnel are on duty).
   7.4.2. All units will complete their protective actions upon receipt of weather warnings.

7.5. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice provided to supported
customers that alerts them to weather conditions that could affect their operations. Advisories
are issued for a 5 NM radius of PAFB and CMAFS.
   7.5.1. Table 7.5. Contains all of the weather advisories issued for PAFB along with desired
   lead-times.

Table 7.5. Weather Advisory Criteria and Minimum Desired Lead-Times

 Criteria                                     Desired Lead-Time
 Surface Winds > 25 kts                       Observed
 Wind Chill Temp 0F to -24F                 Observed
 Wind Chill Temp < -25F                      Observed
 Unfavorable PT Weather                       Observed
7.6. Dissemination and Numbering. Watches, warnings and advisories will be numbered
consecutively for an entire month by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning or
advisory) followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month
while the second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message
“Weather Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02), and this is the fifth (005) warning
issued in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December
(12), and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different weather
products are contained in Attachment 3 of this Instruction.
   7.6.1. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e., winds
   increase from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the
   desired lead-times previously specified. Only one forecasted warning, excluding the
   observed lightning warnings, may be in effect at one time. If a warning is issued for one
   criteria and it becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning, with a new
   number, will be issued to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be
   specified for each criterion if necessary.
   7.6.2. Extensions or Changes. Extensions or changes will only be issued to change the valid
   time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New warnings and
   watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
   7.6.3. Cancellation. Watches and warnings may be cancelled when the weather phenomena
   are no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not cancelled, they will expire at
   the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be cancelled when the criteria is no
   longer occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour. The lightning warning
   and watch will always be cancelled when no longer expected.
7.7. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The purpose of SWAP is to ensure weather
station management (senior, experienced personnel) are notified and respond to both potential
and/or actual severe weather events within the WFs area of responsibility. SWAP activation
 36                                                    21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013


criteria may include any watch/warning criteria, but will primarily be used for severe
watches/warnings (tornadoes, winds > 50kts, hail > ¾ inches, heavy rain, blizzard and freezing
precipitation). When the 25 OWS issues a watch or warning during non-duty hours, the CP will
notify the N-NC duty forecaster. The N-NC duty forecaster will, in turn, recall the standby
forecaster. During normal duty hours, SWAP activation discretion lies with the on-duty
Aviation Operations forecaster using his or her experience along with guidance from senior
flight leadership. This includes coordination with the 25 OWS (team effort between the WF and
OWS). Further SWAP details are provided in the WFs SWAP SOP. NOTE: WF operational
support may be limited to all base units/customers during severe weather events due to limited
manning and availability. Limitations to customer support may include: WF personnel answer
only telephone hotlines, shortened/cancelled weather briefings, long telephone hold periods,
slower updates to various MWPs, etc.
   7.7.1. SWAP Activation Conditions. Once the Aviation Operations forecaster expects
   SWAP activation conditions to occur, he/she will notify the Severe Weather Action Team
   (SWAT) leader via telephone (see WF monthly work schedule for current SWAT leader and
   contact information--updated, as needed, by the WF NCOIC), follow the SWAP SOP and
   coordinate with the OWSs PAFB/CMAFS forecaster. Once contacted, the SWAT leader will
   determine whether to activate the team. If deemed appropriate, the SWAT leader will report
   to the WF as soon as possible (30 minutes ideally) and may call in additional personnel to
   assist. The 25 OWS will provide backup SWAT support for the WF in the event of
   communication failure, equipment outages, personnel unavailability, etc. NOTE: Per
   AFMAN 15-129V2, WF leadership will conduct and document an annual SWAP exercise.
   Real-world severe weather events can be used in place of these exercises and will be
   documented to include lessons learned.
   7.7.2. Procedures Before and During Potential Severe Weather. The Aviation Operations
   forecaster will keep the SWAT standby person/leader informed of the potential for severe
   weather. He or she will immediately notify the SWAT leader (30 minute recall) whenever
   the potential for severe weather moves or forms within 100 NM of PAFB/CMAFS and/or is
   expected to affect PAFB/CMAFS within 4 hours. The SWAT leader and the Aviation
   Operations forecaster will discuss, analyze and assess the severe weather threat in
   conjunction with 25 OWS PAFB/CMAFS forecasters by reviewing pertinent meteorological
   information. The goal is to commit earlier and issue severe weather watches and warnings
   based more on severe weather indicators and less on actual sightings. If the SWAT leader,
   OWS forecaster and Aviation Operations forecaster determine there is a risk for severe
   weather, they will implement a contingent of the team, as needed. Otherwise, Aviation
   Operations will return to normal operations.
   7.7.3. Task Assignments. Once the team is in place, the SWAT leader will assign tasks
   (monitor weather radar, answer telephones, etc.) and ensure special attention is paid to the
   WF Duty Priorities (Chapter 1.4.). The members will dedicate their efforts to their assigned
   tasks and keep the team leader updated on events. Aviation Operations forecaster will
   maintain primary focus on the changing weather scenario and will coordinate (OWS, SWAT
   leader) a final decision on which weather products to issue.
   7.7.4. Post-Event Procedures. Once the SWAT leader, OWS forecaster and Aviation
   Operations forecaster have determined the severe weather threat has passed, the SWAT
   leader will ensure the WF is returned to “ops normal” (ensure work area is clean,
21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 37


   answer/return any pending phone calls, report any severe weather damage, etc.) before
   dismissing the SWAT. Any changes to the SWAP will be documented in this instruction
   (annotated on the WFs master copy prior to an update) and in the WF’S SWAP SOP. NOTE:
   If unsecure means are used to forward installation damage, ensure Operations Security
   (OPSEC) measures are implemented to protect critical information. Encrypt all e-mail
   messages containing damage which causes loss of capability and mission activity.
   7.7.5. Additional SWAP Notification. In addition to previous criteria (Chapter 7.7.), the
   SWAT leader will be notified by Aviation Operations when PAFB/CMAFS is included in the
   following:
       7.7.5.1. The NWS issues a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch or warning area for El
       Paso County. (The Aviation Operations forecaster will use his/her discretion to notify the
       SWAT leader for upstream or nearby counties.)
       7.7.5.2. The Storm Prediction Center has PAFB/CMAFS in a severe area.
7.8. Severe Weather Damage Reporting. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, AFI 10-229 and AFI 10-
206, the WF will develop procedures to provide appropriate information to the CP. The WF will
coordinate with the CP for weather related Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3) and provide the CP
with any pertinent base information. The CP, in turn, will provide the WF with an unclassified
copy of any weather related OPREPs. The WF will provide damage reports and OPREP-3s to
the OWS and the CP will provide OPREP-3s to Higher Headquarters as soon as possible.
NOTE: The CP is the releasing authority for OPREP-3s. A courtesy copy to Higher HQ is
acceptable, but is not considered an “official” OPREP.
   7.8.1. Information required to be provided by the WF to the CP includes:
       7.8.1.1. Actual severe weather conditions experienced.
       7.8.1.2. The forecast valid at the time of the occurrence to include any watches or
       warning that were issued.
       7.8.1.3. Operational status of meteorological equipment (radar, wind sensors, etc.).
       7.8.1.4. Any other pertinent information (damage reports, visual/radar tornadic
       confirmations, etc.)
7.9. Toxic Corridor. Per AFI 10-2501, toxic corridor responsibility lies with Fire Emergency
Services. The WF will provide weather data necessary to calculate Toxic Corridors to Fire
Emergency Services and/or the Emergency Operations Center, as requested. The OWS may
supplement meteorological data to the appropriate Peterson organizations if requested and the
WF is unable to provide the data.
7.10. Chemical Downwind Messages/Effective Downwind Messages. Fire Emergency
Services is the primary OPR for providing CDM/EDM support. CDM and EDM are used to
determine the spread of chemical and biological agents that are released. Per AFI 10-2501, the
OWS is responsible for providing meteorological data towards the calculation of Toxic Corridor
products. The WF may also supplement the OWS with this weather data-only support, if
required.

                                           Chapter 8

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

8.1. General. Weather information is only useful if customers have access to the information.
Timely and efficient dissemination of weather information is crucial to the success of the PAFB
and CMAFS missions and resource protection. Most organizations will receive this information
via the primary dissemination system. AFI 10-229 restricts the number of organizations the WF
can directly notify (via telephone) in order to focus on incoming weather phenomena. This
chapter describes the weather dissemination systems and dissemination procedures as well as
backup systems and procedures.
8.2. Dissemination Systems and Backups.
   8.2.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). Currently the WF/OWS team uses the JET as its
   primary method for the dissemination of watches, warnings and advisories. The JET is a
   web-based graphical interface. Other agencies requiring direct access to the JET may request
   access through the WF JET Manager. Agencies without direct JET access will receive
   critical weather information through their unit’s own dissemination system (e.g., Pyramid
   Alert Recall, Unit Control Center, etc.). The same information is also available on the 25
   OWS webpage. The WF/OWS will follow documented backup dissemination procedures in
   the event that the JET server is inoperative (other units should access this information via the
   25                          OWS                             webpage                           at
   https://ows.dm.af.mil/tailored_met/index.cfm?fuseaction=showunit&B_ICAO=KCOS&
   WWA_ICAO=KPEF&UNIT_ID=45&BW=H&UF=M&aor=2                                                      or
   https://ows.dm.af.mil/By_Type/wwa/index.cfm?fuseaction=none&UID=45&BW=H&U
   F=M&AOR=2&USEHF=1).
   8.2.2. The WF will follow documented back-up dissemination procedures IAW published
   SOPs in the event JET becomes inoperative.
   8.2.3. The 21 Communications Squadron (CS) will handle all server maintenance and will
   apply AFWA patches.
8.3. Local Area Network. The LAN is the primary method used for disseminating MWPs. In
the event of a LAN outage, MWPs will be faxed to operational customers or made available on a
disk for pickup by the flying customers for posting on computers within their respective units.
8.4. Watches, Warnings and Advisories. WWAs will be disseminated via the JET. When
warnings are issued, the 25 OWS or WF will give a courtesy call to the CP. If the JET is not
functioning, the 25 OWS and/or WF will contact the same organizations via telephone. Further
dissemination by the WF, Airfield Operations and the Command Post is as follows:
   8.4.1. Watch, Warning and Advisory Notifications. Watches and warnings will be further
   disseminated by the CP and Airfield Operations according to Attachment 4 of this
   Instruction. Units listed will develop methods to notify subordinate agencies. Groups should
   use their 24-hour operations to recall other key personnel/units that are needed to implement
   resource protection plans.
   8.4.2. Airfield Operations. Airfield Operations relays all weather warnings via the
   secondary crash net to the agencies outlined in Attachment 4.

                          WEATHER EQUIPMENT/INTERFACES

9.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance and restoring priorities.
9.2. Weather Equipment. The WF uses a wide range of equipment and interfaces to determine
the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems are used continuously to provide
customers the most timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible.
9.3. CMAFS Weather Equipment. The WF maintains a fixed based weather observation
system (FMQ-22) at CMAFS which is located just east of Bldg 104. Readouts for this
equipment are located, via dedicated laptop, in the N-NC WSE work center or can be obtained
via the JET Portal. This weather observation system is capable of measuring wind speed and
direction; temperature and dew point; pressure; prevailing visibility and present weather; cloud
ceiling heights; precipitation amounts; freezing rain detection and lightning strike detection.
   9.3.1. Maintenance and Sustainment. The 21 CS provides maintenance and sustainment
   support of this system; to include hardware preventative maintenance, system repairs and
   limited software assistance.
9.4. KCOS ASOS. PAFB has a single-instrument runway that is shared with the Colorado
Springs Municipal Airport. Readouts for the observing equipment are located in the WF
operations area. This primary airfield weather observation system is capable of measuring wind
speed and direction; temperature and dew point; pressure; prevailing visibility and present
weather; cloud ceiling heights; precipitation amounts; freezing rain detection and lightning strike
detection.
   9.4.1. There is only one ASOS on the airfield complex. The sensor group is located near the
   approach end of runway 17L.
   9.4.2. Maintenance and Sustainment. The NWS owns the ASOS equipment and has sole
   responsibility for maintenance and sustainment IAW NWSPD 30-211. The PAFB WF
   maintains a Video Display Unit (VDU) located at the Aviation Operations forecast counter
   that connects via land line to the ASOS system and provides the most recent observation as
   well as current sensor measurements. The WF will call the ASOS Operations Maintenance
   Center (AOMC) at 1-800-242-8194 for any maintenance required for the VDU. If the VDU
   is not functioning to the point that it cannot be repaired, the AOMC will replace the terminal
   as funds allow.
9.5. Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD)/Weather Surveillance Radar – 1988 Doppler
(WSR-88D). NEXRAD is a Doppler weather radar and data processing system which collects,
processes and displays high-resolution reflectivity and velocity data and has an effective range of
248 NM.
   9.5.1. The WF utilizes Gibson Ridge Radar Software (an Internet-based interface) to analyze
   and interpret NEXRAD radar data. NOTE: The WF also maintains an annual subscription
   to WeatherTap software (also accessed through the Internet) as a backup source for obtaining
   radar information.
21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              41


9.6. JET. As discussed in Chapter 8 of this instruction, the JET is the primary system for
dissemination of weather watches, warnings and advisories. Telephone is used as a back-up to
this system.
9.7. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (226.1 MHz) allows the WF to communicate with
aircrews, both on the ground and in the air, as well as tower personnel. If the PMSV is out of
service, Airfield Operations will issue a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) to notify aircrews so they
can contact the 25 OWS via phone patch (where possible) to get weather data.
9.8. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as a backup system as well as for
passing along Critical and time sensitive information rapidly.
9.9. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN, both unclassified (NIPR)
and classified (SIPR), to improve the timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our
customers.
9.10. NORTHCOM Enterprise Network (NEN). The WF relies heavily on the NEN to
improve the timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our N-NC customers.
9.11. Lightning Detection System (LDS). The WF maintains a Vaisala LDS system which
includes software, hardware (satellite dish receiver) and annual data and communication line
subscriptions. The LDS allows the WF to maintain dedicated access to the National Lightning
Detection Network (NLDN). The NLDN provides real-time monitoring of cloud-to-ground
lightning activity across the CONUS, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.
9.12. Maintenance. All equipment requires some sort of maintenance from time-to-time.
Weather data is obtained via leased commercial telephone lines, the Internet and satellite
download for ingest into the various weather systems.
   9.12.1.

Table 9.1. outlines the organizations that provide preventive maintenance and repair of
weather communications equipment or interface.

                                          Chapter 10

                        25 OWS/21 OSS/OSW BACKUP SUPPORT

10.1. General. There are dozens of scenarios that could cause an interruption of service from
either the 25 OWS or the WF. This chapter briefly describes how weather services will be
provided should any such events occur.
10.2. 25 OWS. Per 25 OWS/PAFB WF Data Page, when weather operations at the 25 OWS are
interrupted (e.g., power outage, natural disaster, etc.); resource protection, WWA responsibility
and transient flight briefings will be transferred to the WF until the 25 OWS is prepared to
resume operations. Other 25 OWS weather information responsibilities (e.g., graphical
products) will be transferred to other agencies, as necessary.
10.3. For standard station evacuations- support will resume from the alternate weather
operations site with the OWS assuming responsibilities during the interim period. For
longer interruptions, the WF will coordinate required support with other organizations. The 25
OWS will not normally produce and disseminate tactical-level weather products for PAFB and
CMAFS mission execution. However, when operational constraints prevent the WF from
accomplishing tasks, the 25 OWS may produce and disseminate selected tactical-level weather
products (Web-Based MWPs, verbal discussions, faxed products, etc.) on a short-term basis.
The WF will coordinate the transfer of this responsibility with the 25 OWS.
21SWI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                43
