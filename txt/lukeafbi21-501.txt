 2                                                        LUKEAFBI21-501 25 APRIL 2011




1. Responsibilities: Commanders, maintenance officers, and staff agency OIC/NCOICs will
ensure compliance with this instruction.
     1.1. Maintenance Scheduling Application Tool (MSAT): MSAT is an AF standard
     system for querying aircraft scheduling information and reports from base level systems.
     The system is updated each morning by 56th Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS)
     Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D). The information is pulled from reports
     which database management (DBM) runs each night.
2. Procedures for Time Change Items
     2.1. Procedures for Ordering Cartridge Actuated Devices / Propellant Actuated
     Devices (CAD/PAD): PS&D will forecast, schedule, requisition, and defer TCIs in
     accordance with (IAW) applicable instructions. TCIs will be requisitioned between 45 and
     60 days prior to the required need quarter through munitions operations (AFK), 56
     EMS/MXMWMA, using established forecast spreadsheet provided by AFK.
        2.1.1. Forecasts submitted must include asset requirements for the next six month period
        to allow for early maintenance.
        2.1.2. Issue requests required for the following week’s scheduled maintenance must be
        submitted via E-Docs NLT Tuesdays by 1200hrs to AFK.
        2.1.3. Turn-in requests must be submitted via E-Docs NLT Wednesdays by 1600hrs to
        AFK.
        2.1.4. Contact 56th Equipment Maintenance Squadron Munitions Inspection to schedule
        an appointment to turn-in/pick-up assets on Thursdays after request paperwork has been
        submitted. When requesting unscheduled, emergency, or unforecasted assets, use
        standard letter from AFK.
     2.2. All Workcenters performing time changes will: Notify PS&D whenever a TCI is
     removed in IMDS by maintenance data collection for any reason other than time change.
     This will allow for correction of installation date in Integrated Maintenance Data System
     (IMDS) to coincide with due time. All TCI suspenses will be processed by PS&D only.
     2.3. PS&D will:
        2.3.1. Load or change TCI data in IMDS upon acceptance of an aircraft from another
        unit or upon depot return. Ensure data is entered in all applicable data fields.
        2.3.2. Save a copy of the time change PRA to an external hard drive weekly in case
        MSAT and/or the MIS is not working.
        2.3.3. Order non-CAD/PAD TCIs through AMU supply personnel, using AF IMT 2005
        or IMDS Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), if available, NLT 60 days prior to (but
        not less than 10 days) before the need date. The ordering date should be based on the
        availability of items in supply. 425th PS&D tracks the TCIs and the Weapons Flight
        forecasts and orders them.
        2.3.4. Notify AMU weapons section to order M-61A1 gun TCIs when the gun is between
        6,000 and 7,000 rounds from due time.
