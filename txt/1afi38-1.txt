                                                                       Pages: 4/Distribution: F

This instruction in conjunction with ANGI 10-203 prescribes command relationships, policies
and procedures for sovereignty operations, homeland defense and homeland security events
within the assigned Air National Guard (ANG) units gained by CONR-1 AF (AFNORTH). It
defines command responsibilities and the personnel status for individuals performing a federal
mission. It also defines those events involving a federal mission that will activate the CONR-1
AF (AFNORTH) Commander’s (1 AF/CC) delegated authority to recall a member of the ANG
to active duty under 10 U.S.C. 12301(d). This instruction applies to all personnel assigned to
CONR-1 AF (AFNORTH) gained units for aerospace warning and control missions. This
applies to the NORAD missions of aerospace warning and control and to the analogous
homeland defense missions conducted under the operational command of United States Northern
Command (USNORTHCOM). Throughout this instruction, wherever the NORAD missions or
aerospace warning and control are cited, it is expressly intended to apply also to the related
missions performed by USNORTHCOM. For the purposes of this instruction, alert detachments
refer only to geographically separate alert operations conducted away from the wing’s main
operating base that are established solely to support the federal North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD) mission of aerospace warning and control. The procedures
specified in this instruction must be followed on a day-to-day basis. This instruction applies to
all personnel assigned to 101 Air and Space Operations Group (AOG), 101 Information
Operations Flight (IOF), the Western/Eastern Air Defense Squadrons and associated
Directorates , and Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) wings and detachments.

1. Mission, Command and Responsibilities of First Air Force. (From ACCMD 202, Vol. 2)

1.1. Commander, First Air Force has three missions. First, as a USAF numbered Air Force
commander, ensures assigned air and space forces are combat-ready for full-spectrum air and
space operations. Second, as commander of the Continental United States (CONUS) NORAD
Region (CONR), a geographical area of operations within the bi-national command NORAD,
commands and employs gained, assigned, and attached air and space forces to conduct defensive
counter-air (DCA) missions as directed by Commander, NORAD (CDRNORAD), within
assigned areas of operation.     Third, as Commander, Air Forces Northern (AFNORTH),
conducts air component planning, execution, and assessment of the full spectrum of air and space
power required to support USNORTHCOM air missions, acts as COMAFFOR for gained,
assigned, and attached forces within assigned areas of operation and, when directed, commands
and employs gained, assigned, and attached air and space forces to support
CDRUSNORTHCOM.

1.2 AF (AFNORTH) is a U.S. Air Force organization that is assigned to Air Combat Command
(ACC) and reports to the Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC) for all matters of uni-
service interest.

1.3 As the Commander of a Component-Numbered Air Force (C-NAF), the 1 AF/CC has been
delegated by the SECAF authority contained in 10 USC 12301(d) to activate Title 32 guardsmen
who have volunteered to support CONR 1 AF (AFNORTH) missions.

2. Federal Mission Requirements

2.1. 32 U.S.C. 502(f) authorizes Title 32 guardsmen to conduct duties in support of federal
operations undertaken at the request of the President or Secretary of Defense. This is applicable
to Air National Guard units assigned to conduct the NORAD mission of aerospace warning and
control. Accordingly, most guardsmen will perform their duties in Title 32 status under the
operational direction of their Title 10 commander. Despite the provisions in 32 U.S.C. 502(f),
there are times when the Title 32 guardsmen must be activated to accomplish a federal mission.
First, Commander NORAD/USNORTHCOM requires an unbroken chain of command down to
the armed fighters conducting aerospace warning and control. Secondly, it places those
individuals executing these missions under the provisions and protection of federal law and the
UCMJ when the use of deadly force could be directed by an appropriate authority.

3. Structure of CONR-1 AF (AFNORTH)

3.1. CONR-1 AF (AFNORTH) is a Title 10 active duty U.S. Air Force organization, which is
an assigned ACC C-NAF. The CONR-1 AF (AFNORTH) C-NAF is composed of two
organizations, the AFFOR Staff (Air Force Forces) and 601 AOC (Air and Space Operations
Center). The AFFOR Staff is comprised of approximately 62% ANG members on 10 U. S.C.
12301 Statutory Tours, with the remaining personnel comprised of regular Air Force, Air Force
Reserve, Title 5 Civilians and Contractors. Manpower support for the 601 AOC is provided
primarily by a Florida ANG Title 32 organization, the 101 AOG. Additional manpower for the
601 AOC is also provided by the 101 IOF, a Utah ANG Title 32 organization along with AEF
augmentation (AD, ANG and AFR). Selected personnel in these Title 32 organizations are
activated to Title 10 status in response to federal missions.
3                                                     1 AF Instruction 38-1, 29 September 2009

4. Activation of ANG Forces to Perform NORAD Missions of Aerospace Warning and
Control

4.1. The Secretary of the Air Force has authority under 10 U.S.C. 12301(d) to activate ANG
members to federal active duty, with the consent of the member and the state governor. This
authority has been delegated to the 1 AF/CC for the NORAD missions of aerospace warning and
control.
5                                                      1 AF Instruction 38-1, 29 September 2009



4.2. Memorandums of Agreements (MOAs) have been established between the 1 AF CC and the
governor of each state containing an ANG unit that is either 1 AF (AFNORTH)-gained or may
be temporarily gained by 1 AF (AFNORTH). The MOAs are maintained at 1 AF (AFNORTH)
JA.

4.3. As a condition of employment and membership in a CONR-1 AF (AFNORTH) gained
ANG unit, Title 32 personnel are required to execute a statement documenting their consent to
volunteer for federal active duty pursuant to 10 USC 12301(d) for the purposes of executing the
NORAD missions of aerospace warning and control. Volunteer statements shall be executed by
all 101 AOG, 101 IOF and the Western/Eastern Air Defense Squadron personnel. At a
minimum, volunteer statements shall be executed by all FW and DET aviation, maintenance,
weapon handlers, security, and such other personnel as deemed necessary by the state
leadership/unit commander. These statements will be maintained on record at each member’s
unit headquarters.

5. Triggering Events That Initiate Activation

5.1 The 1 AF/CC orders the self-execution to Title 10 status of participating Title 32 ANG
members upon a declaration of a triggering event. The 1 AF / CC, 601 AOC/CC and the ADS
commanders, or their delegates, may declare a triggering event. Self execution is triggered when
participating Title 32 members originate, transmit or execute orders directing forces performing
the NORAD missions of aerospace warning and control.

5.2. Elements of self execution include:

5.2.1. Instantaneous: The urgency of an aerospace warning and control triggering event
requires use of MOA consent to permit immediate activation to Title 10 status.

5.2.2. For Limited Duration: Self execution to Title 10 shall last for the duration of the
aerospace warning and control event. Upon termination of the event, AGR members revert to
Title 32 status. Technicians and Drill Status Guardsmen remain in Title 10 status for the
remainder of the duty day or until 2400 hours. ANG AGR members may transfer in and out of
Title 10 status during a work period as the pace of aerospace warning and control events dictate.

5.2.3. In Garrison: Self execution for ANG members shall normally be limited to duties
performed in garrison. ANG members may deploy in Title 32 status in CONUS at the discretion
of the Title 32 command structure to support the mission of aerospace warning and control, and
self execute to and from Title 10 status in the deployed location for the duration of these events.
Note: Participating ANG flight crews in Title 10 status may be directed to divert to operating
locations as necessary to prosecute aerospace warning and control events, but shall be returned to
the alert location as soon as operationally feasible after these events terminate.

5.2.4. ASA Fighter Locations: Those personnel directly involved in enabling ASA fighter
aircraft airborne missions will activate to Title 10 Status during an aerospace control event. At a
minimum, the following personnel will activate at fighter locations during these events: the
Command Post controller(s) taking and passing the scramble order/airborne order; the alert
weapons and crew chiefs readying the aircraft for taxi/takeoff and the pilots in the aircraft. The
ASA Commanders/DETCOs may activate further personnel at their discretion.
6                                                      1 AF Instruction 38-1, 29 September 2009



5.2.5. For scramble order/airborne order (ABO). Conversion to Title 10 for ASA personnel
will automatically take place upon receipt of command and control direction to change the alert
posture. The ASA Commanders/DETCOs can order this conversion earlier at their discretion.

5.2.6. For fighters redirected by HHQ during flight. Conversion to Title 10 for ASA
personnel will automatically take place at initial fighter check in with HHQ (EADS/WADS).
The weapons and crew chiefs will convert. The Command Post controller(s) will convert to Title
10 only if an aerospace event order was received and transmitted. If fighters are redirected from
a continuation training sortie or practice scramble without further contact with their Command
Post, the Command Post controller(s) need not convert. In this case, discretion will be left to the
local ASA Commander/DETCO.

Figure 2 - An example of positions that would transfer status for an aerospace warning and
control event. The number and specialties of personnel transferring to T10 may be changed at
the discretion of the unit T10 commander.

5.3. Upon event termination, self executed Title 10 status personnel (AGRs) may revert to
original status at the discretion of the unit ASA Commander/DETCO. A triggering event
terminates when ALL of the following occurs:

          When members self-executed to Title 10 status no longer need to originate, transmit, or
           execute orders issued to Title 10 forces. For example, if ASA crews start engines, move
           the aircraft, or otherwise take actions requiring post-event maintenance or operations
           actions, the event terminates when the aircraft and crews assume the post-event alert
           status.

          When the 1 AF/CC, 601 AOC/CC, or the ADS commander (or their designee) determines
           the conditions that initiated the event have ended and declares the event terminated

          The debrief is complete.

5.4. Alert Relief. Units requiring manning assistance, during steady state operations, should
follow ANGI 10-203 para 4. For contingency operations units should forward requests for
additional forces to AFNORTH CAT (email address). Attachment 2 shows the message format
that should be followed for this requirement.
8                                                      1 AF Instruction 38-1, 29 September 2009


6. Personnel/Duty Status

6.1. When in Title 10 status, 101 AOG personnel are under the command of the 601 AOC/CC.
Sector and wing/alert personnel in Title 10 status are under the command of the applicable ADS
Title 10 commander. All personnel revert to command by their Title 32 commander when the
event is terminated.

6.2. Full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) personnel, including pilots sitting alert for ASA
duties, may continue to perform their duties, however, their Title 32 orders must include a
statement indicating the member is ordered to Title 10 pursuant to self-executing Title 10 orders
upon the initiation of a triggering event.

6.3. Drill status personnel may be placed on Title 32 training orders with a statement providing
that the member is ordered to Title 10 pursuant to self-executing Title 10 orders upon the
declaration of a triggering event, or on continuous Title 10 orders issued pursuant to 10 USC
12301(d). These orders, or combination of orders, may be for a total of not more than 365 days
per individual per fiscal year. Personnel on continuous Title 10 orders may, for brief periods,
accomplish other duties incidental to training requirements without requiring a break in their
orders. Personnel, including pilots performing ASA duties, on Title 32 orders containing a self-
executing Title 10 clause shall accomplish training requirements in Title 32 status.

6.4. Personnel in military technician status may perform duty in Title 32 technician status but
shall be activated to Title 10 pursuant to self-executing Title 10 orders and their volunteer
statements during a triggering event. Written orders will be issued to the activated personnel
following the event. Any duty performed in a technician status prior to activation, will result in
the member being paid for the number of hours worked during his/her normal work schedule up
to eight hours. Any hours worked over eight hours will be recorded as compensatory time
earned. Any duty performed by a technician on weekends or outside of the members normal
work schedule will be recorded as compensatory time earned. The member will also be entitled
to active duty pay under the Title 10 order.

6.5. The AOC, Sectors, and alert units will ensure drill status guard members sign volunteer
statements giving their consent to self execute to a Title 10 status. Personnel performing Inactive
Duty Training (IDT) may perform AOC, Sector, or alert duties in Title 32 status IAW ANGI 10-
203 paragraph 3.1, but, during a triggering event, shall be ordered to Title 10 pursant to self-
executing orders and their volunteer statements. Because military pay entitlements are based
upon a twenty-four hour duty day, written orders covering a minimum of a 24 hour period will be
issued to the activated personnel following the event regardless of the time of the event. All IDT
(UTAs, STs and PTs) training for the 24 hour period will cease. According to DODFMR,
Volume 7A, Chapter 58, Paragraph 580102, a member cannot accrue compensation for inactive
duty training performed on the same day on which he or she is also entitled to basic pay for
active duty. Any IDT accomplished by the member before activation will not be paid for this
duty but rather compensated for by the active duty Title 10 order.

6.6. ANG FW pilots who are diverted from a training mission in response to a triggering event
will be ordered to Title 10 pursuant to their volunteer statements and States’ Agreements.
Written orders will be issued for pilots without self-executing orders to document the
instantaneous recall.
9                                                     1 AF Instruction 38-1, 29 September 2009



6.7. The 1 AF/CC delegates to the ADS and wing commanders the automatic voluntary recall
authority of ANG security forces protecting federal resources as a result of a Helping
Hand/Covered Wagon incident. During such an event, security forces personnel who have been
ordered to Title 10 status are authorized to enforce federal laws. Use of force is authorized IAW
AFI 31-207, attachment 2, sections A2.1, A.2.2, and A2.3.

6.8. The majority of personnel in 1 AF-gained units perform their duties in Title 32 status, and
only periodically and for brief periods are certain personnel ordered to Title 10 to perform
NORAD aerospace warning and control missions. Pilots and personnel assigned alert
responsibilities on continuous Title 10 orders should be coded and be reimbursed to comply with
AF Instruction 65-604, ―Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes,‖ and ensure they are charged
to Military Personnel, Air Force (3500) and not to National Guard Personnel, Air Force (3850).

7.0. Accountability tracking during status changes

7.1. Reimbursement will be claimed from the Air Force for air sovereignty events or contingency
operations lasting 24 hours or longer. For events that last less than 24 hours, reimbursement will
not be requested from the Air Force. Military pay entitlements are based upon a 24 hour day;
therefore reimbursement for any period of less than 24 hours is not applicable. AFNORTH/A1
will provide AFNORTH/FM a certified list, broken down by name, rank and dates of
participation of all those personnel who self execute into Title 10 status during a real-world air
sovereignty or contingency event of 24 hours or more duration. This process will be initiated at
the completion of each real world air sovereignty or contingency operation lasting 24 hours or
more, or on a monthly basis depending upon the duration of the event. Units will not be required
to track Title 10 activations for events that last less than 24 hours.

7.2. Sectors, the AOC, and ASA units will provide AFNORTH/A1 a certified list, broken down
by name, rank and dates of participation of all those personnel who self execute into Title 10
status during a real-world air sovereignty or contingency event of 24 hours or more duration.
AFNORTH/A1 will consolidate the lists into a single certified list and forward it to
AFNORTH/FM. The information from this certified list will be converted to a final bill that
