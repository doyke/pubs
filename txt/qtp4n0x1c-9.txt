                                        INTRODUCTION

1. These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-
job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialist, Independent Duty Medical
Technician (IDMT), 4N0X1C personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the
breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to
guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance.
QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees
concerning tasks which need third-party certification.

2. Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the
trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS
Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all
4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange
training for each module in the order that you decide.

3. Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to
review the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each
module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is
expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow
sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach).
Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient
time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without
assistance.

4. When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an
objective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used
as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the
objective, document task completion appropriately in the six-part folder.

5. The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task
Certification and Recurring Training, filed in part 3, section B of the six-part training
folder. NOTE: The individual check lists are not filed in each member’s six-part training
folder. A master checklist is filed in part 3, section B of the master training plan (MTP)
six-part training folder.

5. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need
remediation. Conduct a feedback concerning each module with the trainee, and
document appropriately in the 6-part folder. As the trainer, once you are satisfied that
the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective
is met.

6. If the task which is being trained requires third party certification by a task
certifier/certifying official, the trainer must first ensure that the trainee is qualified to
perform the task without assistance. The trainee then will be evaluated by a task
certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third party certification are denoted




                                               iii
with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). The
qualification of training then is documented appropriately in the 6-part folder.

7. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training.
Such standardization will benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each
member’s career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the
Aerospace Medical Service Specialist, IDMT, 4N0X1C, each time that he/she is arrives
to a new duty station. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for
certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training
for Aerospace Medical Service Specialist, IDMT personnel. We value your first hand
expertise and we encourage your feedback. Direct all inquiries to:
