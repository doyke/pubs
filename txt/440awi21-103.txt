     2.3. The responsible workcenter will gather all required information as listed in AFI 21-
     101_AFRC_I, Chapter 14 and forward it to the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and
     Quality Assurance (QA) so that the Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) report can be
     completed and forwarded out to the appropriate agencies within the required 72-hour period.
3. Prevention.
     3.1. Effective prevention begins with supervisors ensuring maintenance personnel are
     properly trained in their AFSC of responsibility. Additionally, all maintenance
     personnel must be knowledgeable of command and unit requirements to prevent dropped
     objects from occurring.
     3.2. DOP starts with proper AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy                    and
     Work Document, and AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance,
     documentation prior to removal and after installation of an aircraft component, cowling,
     door, panel or part. Document aircraft forms in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1, 00-20-5, and
     unit instructions.
     3.3. Personnel must ensure doors, cowlings and panels fit properly. Place special emphasis
     on the condition and serviceability of all fasteners, nut plates and latching devices, as they
     are prime contributors to dropped objects.
     3.4. Special attention must be given to “last minute” maintenance actions.
     3.5. A second look DOP inspection annotated as, “Prior to flight DOPP inspection required”
     will be accomplished prior to each flight in accordance with AFI 21-101_AFRC_I and Local
     Work Card LWC-440MXG-10-1.
4. Investigation.
     4.1. MXG Quality Assurance Office and 440 OG/OGV will:
     4.2. Investigate each dropped object thoroughly, as soon as the loss is discovered/reported.
     Every effort must be taken to determine the precise cause of the loss so permanent corrective
     action can be taken.
     4.3. Where material failure or design deficiency is the cause, MXG/MXQ will ensure
     Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDR) are submitted according to T.O. 00-35D-54
     with information copies to the MAJCOM and NAF/LGM.
     4.4. MXG/MXQ and 440 OG/OGV will ensure dropped objects resulting from maintenance
     or operations malpractice are referred to the applicable MXG/OG Commander for action.
     4.5. The quality assurance office will ensure dropped object incidents are included in the
     MXQ monthly and quarterly summaries.
     4.6. MXG/MXQ and 440 OG/OGV will analyze incidents for unit trends and ensure
     corrective actions are valid and complete.

     appropriate AFTO 781A entries.
     5.2. Aircrew members are to debrief the loss to maintenance immediately after landing.
