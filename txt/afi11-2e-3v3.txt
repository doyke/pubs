SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This volume contains substantial changes that reorganize and clarify operating procedures. The
waiver authority will determine the length of the waiver. Annotations on navigational charts was
clarified to align with AFI 11-202V3. Squadron Operations Officers (SQ/DO) and Detachment
Commanders (DETCOs) may tailor aircrew manning to meet operational requirements.
Squadron Commanders (SQ/CC)/DO may authorize inexperienced CDMTs and ARTs to fly by
themselves, depending on mission requirements. Aircrew duty period was changed to flight duty
period to align with AFI 11-202V3. First Pilot (FP) was added to the flight crew augmentation.
Practice emergency drills was renamed crew coordination drills. The readiness posture section
was clarified. Chapter 4, Flight Crew Operating Procedures, contains substantial
reorganization/clarification of information that requires the user to review. Additional changes
were incorporated and require the user to review their specific area.

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Aircrew Responsibility. This volume, in conjuction with other governing directives,
prescribes those procedures applicable to the operation of E-3 aircraft under most circumstances.
It is not a substitute for sound judgement. Procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.
1.2. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of the
MAJCOM/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictate otherwise. In that
case, the Pilot In Command (PIC) will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
1.3. Waivers. Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, waiver authority
for requirements of this volume is the applicable MAJCOM/A3. Forward waiver requests
through appropriate channels to the MAJCOM/A3 for approval. All approvals will include an
expiration date. ACC/A3TV and ACC/A3CA are Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) on
all waiver requests to this AFI.
1.4. Recommended Changes. Send comments and suggested improvements to this volume on
an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through approved MAJCOM
channels to ACC/A3CA. Forward approved recommendations to ACC/A3CA. AF/A3/5 is the
approval authority for changes to this instruction.
1.5. Distribution. Issue this volume to E-3 aircrew members IAW local procedures.

                                            Chapter 2

                                     MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning rests with the Aircraft
Commander (AC).         Preparation for mission tasking and subsequent execution is the
responsibility of the Mission Crew Commander (MCC). The operations functions of the unit
will support both efforts. Flying crews may perform their own mission planning or units may
utilize mission planning teams or planning cells in order to meet mission planning requirements.
In any case, qualified individuals will be designated to perform mission planning and/or
briefings. Units will develop specific procedures to ensure all aircrew members are thoroughly
prepared for each flight.
     2.1.1. Aircraft Commanders are required to review flight crew training folders prior to every
     flight.
2.2. Forms and Logs. Specific flight plans, logs, and mission forms will be
developed/specified by the appropriate group commander. Existing AF and MAJCOM forms
should be used to the maximum extent possible.
2.3. Fuel Conservation. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited
commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all phases of
mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight
and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
mission accomplishment and training objectives. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize
flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent
profiles and power settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage. Aircrew should
employ the following aviation fuel optimization measures without compromising flight safety or
jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment:
     2.3.1. Optimize fuel loads. Mission plan for the required ramp and recovery fuel. Ensure
     ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft.
     2.3.2. Minimize APU use. Use ground power units when practical.
     2.3.3. Delay engine start time. Establish and implement local engines start time standards.
     2.3.4. Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of equipment not
     necessary to accomplish the mission.
     2.3.5. Establish Command and Control (C2) and flight following procedures to ensure timely
     notification of mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight
     time.
2.4. Navigational Charts.
     2.4.1. Annotate an appropriately scaled navigational chart with the route of flight and the
     following:
        2.4.1.1. Special Use Airspace (SUA) within the altitude structure and within 50 NM of
        the route of flight/orbit airspace per the AFPAM 11-216.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   7


       2.4.1.2. Mission airspace/ E-3 orbit airspace with Altitude blocks. For E-3 air refueling
       airspace, label RVIP, RVCP, AAR Exit Point and annotate any applicable restrictions.
       2.4.1.3. Emergency airfields sufficient to cover the route of flight.
       2.4.1.4. High terrain within 50 NM of the route of flight.
       2.4.1.5. ADIZ boundaries within 50 NM of the route of flight.
       2.4.1.6. Equal Time Point (ETP) and FIR boundaries as required.
   2.4.2. Annotate an Operational Navigation Chart (ONC), or larger scale, with the planned
   departure/arrival airfield and the following:
       2.4.2.1. Planned departure/arrival procedure.
       2.4.2.2. Special Departure Procedure (SDP).
       2.4.2.3. Highest terrain or obstacle along expected route of flight.
       2.4.2.4. Highest terrain or obstacle within 30 NM. NOTE: Units will, if necessary,
       specify flight plan requirements and procedures in their local chapters to meet specialized
       mission requirements.
2.5. Mission Planning Requirements. The appropriate group commander may waive
requirements contained in this paragraph if deemed necessary to accomplish a specific mission.
   2.5.1. Briefings/Debriefings.
       2.5.1.1. The AC/MCC will brief/debrief all crewmembers to ensure safe/effective
       mission accomplishment. Locally developed briefing guides (developed IAW AFI 11-
       202V3) will be used to provide a reference list of items that apply to a particular mission
       and will be used as the basis for mission planning and briefing actions. Brief items in any
       logical sequence, and those items understood by all participants may be briefed as
       “Standard”. All aircrew members will attend these briefings unless excused by the
       AC/MCC or unless local procedures dictate otherwise. NOTE: Units will develop and
       document guidance for items that are commonly briefed as “Standard”. The purpose of
       unit or local standards is to reduce the briefing time of administrative tasks to allow for
       concentration on the mission. In no case do these procedures relieve the aircrew of the
       responsibility to comply with USAF directives. Aircrew will use these procedures unless
       conditions, objectives or execution dictate the aircraft commander to brief as “non-
       standard.”
       2.5.1.2. Passengers. The AC will assign a crewmember to be responsible for passengers
       or distinguished visitors; reference Transportation of Passengers in paragraph 3.12 in this
       instruction for minimum responsibilities.
       2.5.1.3. Aircraft and Aircrew Status. Aircraft status will be obtained on the day of the
       flight from the appropriate maintenance unit including open discrepancies from the Air
       Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
       Document. Aircrew status will be obtained from ARMS personnel. Aircraft and aircrew
       status will be briefed/addressed as appropriate.
       2.5.1.4. Weapons Controller Assisted Rendezvous. Either the AC or Nav will review the
       Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) rendezvous procedures and techniques with the AWO in
 8                                                          AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


        charge of assisting the rendezvous. The Nav will supply the AWO with the following

                                           Chapter 3

                         AIRCREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. PIC Responsibilities. SQ/CC shall designate an AC, Instructor Pilot (IP), or Evaluator
Pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights, on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and applicable supplements. The PIC is responsible for the safe, effective
conduct of flight operations. The aircrew is responsible to the PIC for the successful
accomplishment of all flight activities IAW AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM
supplements. PIC responsibilities and/or authority include:
   3.1.1. Managing crew resources and safe mission accomplishment.
   3.1.2. Welfare of the crew.
   3.1.3. Final word for requesting or accepting any waivers affecting the crew or mission.
   3.1.4. Ensuring that any portion of the flight affecting the accomplishment of the E-3
   mission is coordinated with the MCC.
3.2. Crew Manning.
   3.2.1. Minimum flight crew manning includes the AC, Copilot (CP) or FP, Nav, and Flight
   Engineer (FE).
   3.2.2. Proficiency (P)-sorties will be flown with a minimum of five crewmembers: AC, CP,
   Nav, FE, and one additional crewmember to act as safety observer. The applicable
   Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) has the waiver authority to authorize a flight
   without a safety observer.
   3.2.3. Minimum mission crew manning to power up the mission systems will include MCC,
   ASO, ART, CDMT, CT, and CSO. Mission crew manning may vary by the type of mission
   flown.
   3.2.4. Normally, aircrew manning for operational employment will be IAW AFI 65-503, US
   Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, Table A36-1. Mission crew manning may vary by the
   type of mission flown; SQ/DO or DETCO may tailor aircrew manning to meet operational
   requirements.
   3.2.5. Unless waived by the SQ CC/DO, inexperienced CDMTs will fly with an experienced
   CDMT, and inexperienced ARTs will fly with an experienced ART, at all times, until
   certified experienced.
3.3. Crew Rest/Flight Duty Period (FDP)/Crew Augmentation. Crew rest, flight duty period
and crew augmentation will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM supplements with
the following additional guidance:
   3.3.1. With autopilot, altitude hold, or any axis of the autopilot inoperative, limit basic FDP
   to 12 hours and augmented FDP to 16 hours.
   3.3.2. Flight crew augmentation.
       3.3.2.1. In addition to the normal flight crew, minimum crew augmentation will consist
       of a qualified AC, NAV, and FE who are current in duties that will be performed on that
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               11


       sortie. (Adding flight crewmembers after the first takeoff in a crew duty period is not
       considered augmentation.)
       3.3.2.2. The applicable OG/CC (or as delegated) will determine the augmented mission
       crew composition depending upon mission requirements.
   3.3.3. Non-duty Time. Crewmembers will be afforded 12 hours of non-duty time after a
   flight before reporting for normal non-flying duties, unless waived by SQ CC/DO.
   3.3.4. Crew Rest Timing. Crew rest for successive flight activity will begin when the last
   crewmember departs after completing related aircrew duties but not earlier than 1 hour after
   final landing from previous flight activity.
   3.3.5. Crew Rest for Deploying/Redeploying Aircrews. When transitioning four time zones
   or more, unless waived by applicable operations group commander, ground time between
   landing and subsequent takeoff will not be planned for less than 18 hours. This does not
   apply to “Ops stops” made within an aircrew duty period.
   3.3.6. Management of AFRC Crewmembers. The on-scene commander or E-3 DETCO is
   responsible for the effective management of aircrews. An element of that responsibility is
   the effective use of the Reserve associate aircrew personnel during their periods of
   availability. There is no guarantee that missions will always be completed at scheduled
   Mission End Time (MET). Therefore, it is incumbent upon Reserve associate crew members
   to make available sufficient time to accommodate unavoidable delays in returning to home
   station. Scheduled Return Time (SRT) will be calculated MET plus 24 hours for routine
   exercise and operational deployments. SRT(s) for contingencies and missions of unknown
   duration will be determined by the 513 ACG/CC and 552 OG/CC or the requesting authority
   in coordination with HQ AFRC. The SRT will be determined and placed on the initial and
   subsequent flight authorizations until the mission is complete. The overall objective is to
   recover aircrews on schedule and provide scheduling stability. Two essential elements of
   this concept are realistic determination of SRT(s) based on mission duration and
   conscientious management by the on-scene commander or DETCO to ensure return of
   reserve associate aircrews by the MET. Except in uncontrollable or unusual circumstances,
   Reserve associate crewmembers must be assured that their missions will be complete within
   the SRT. The Reserve associate AC and MCC will be provided a copy of all mission
   itinerary changes. Delays in return of Reserve associate personnel beyond their SRT will be
   coordinated through the 552 OG/CC, the 513 ACG/CC, and concurred with by the aircrew.
   Every available means will be used to return Reserve associate crewmembers to home station
   to meet the SRT. If Reserve associate aircrew (or members) cannot extend past the SRT, the
   on-scene commander will verify whether military or contract means of transportation is
   available. If no such means are available, the on-scene commander or DETCO will use the
   most expeditious means, including commercial air, to return Reserve associate personnel to
   home station.
3.4. Pre-Mission Duties. The AC in coordination with the MCC and DO/DETCO, may adjust
crew report time to meet mission requirements. Crew report times will allow sufficient time to
accomplish all preflight activities (normally 2+15 hours prior to takeoff). Normally use a 3+30
hour show time prior to takeoff for sorties planned and flown on the same day, unless a Mission
Planning Team (MPT) is utilized. If an MPT is utilized, the SQ/DO or MPT will set the show
time. The FE and technicians (CSO/CT/CDMT/ART) should arrive at the aircraft 1+30 hours
 12                                                        AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


prior to the scheduled takeoff time. Crew show at the aircraft for all other crewmembers will
normally be no later than 1 hour prior to the scheduled takeoff time.
   3.4.1. On the day of the mission, aircrew should only be scheduled for duties related to the
   mission, regardless of duty day.
3.5. Minimum Equipment. The 552 OG is the Combat Air Force (CAF) lead for developing
and maintaining the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) for use by all AWACS units. The MEL is
a guide to determine operable equipment required for safe flight. 552 OG will forward a copy of
the MEL to HQ ACC/A3CA, HQ PACAF/A3T, and HQ AFRC/A3T.
3.6. Communications.
   3.6.1. Required Radio Calls. Make the following radio calls to the applicable command post
   or operations center, unless local directives or tactical deception requirements specify
   otherwise:
       3.6.1.1. Maintenance discrepancies which will delay preflight or takeoff (AC).
       3.6.1.2. Engine start time (at least 10 minutes prior to engine start to allow notification of
       Central Security Control (CSC) when appropriate). (AC/CP)
       3.6.1.3. Anytime equipment malfunction or incident occurs that will adversely affect
       mission accomplishment. (AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.4. Actual takeoff time. (Nav)
       3.6.1.5. Significant changes in mission timing. (Nav)
       3.6.1.6. Post-air refueling report. (CSO) (Optional per AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.7. On station/Ops Normal time (NLT 15 minutes after arriving on station). (CSO)
       (Optional per AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.8. Time off station (NLT 15 minutes after departing station). (CSO) (Optional per
       AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.9. Maintenance codes and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) prior to final landing.
       (CSO)
       3.6.1.10. Revised ETA (if changed by more than 15 minutes) when in UHF radio
       contact. (Nav)
       3.6.1.11. Sortie block time and flight duration. (Nav)
   3.6.2. Maintenance Codes (Aircraft Landing Status and System Capability Codes). The FE
   and each technician will provide the maintenance codes to the CSO prior to landing. Use the
   Aircraft Landing Status and System Capability Codes as defined in AFI 21-101, Aerospace
   Equipment Maintenance Management, and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
3.7. AWO Assisted/Directed Rendezvous Responsibilities.
   3.7.1. AWO Assisted Rendezvous. The AWO will provide information to assist the Nav in
   accomplishing the rendezvous and for situational awareness. AWOs will execute the
   rendezvous IAW with paragraph 2.5.1.4 of this AFI.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   13


       3.7.1.1. Communications. Internal coordination between the Nav and AWO during the
       rendezvous will be over Net 1. Other crewmembers will not use Net 1 for 30 minutes
       before the AAR Control Time (ARCT) until after the refueling is complete, unless safety
       of flight is in jeopardy.
       3.7.1.2. Procedures. The AWO will execute the pre-planned type of rendezvous as
       coordinated with the AC, Nav, and tanker. The AWO will pass bearing, range, and offset
       of the tanker as prebriefed/required. The AC will advise the AWO/MCC when to
       terminate mission crew assistance and when the mission systems may be configured for
       AAR. 3.7.2. AWODirected Rendezvous. The SD is primarily responsible for the success
       of the AWO directed rendezvous. The AWO will brief the flight deck and the SD on the
       A/R rendezvous procedure to be employed. AWOs will execute the rendezvous IAW
       with paragraph 2.5.1.5 of this AFI.
       3.7.2.1. During Directed Rendezvous AWOs will voice vectors, altitude changes and any
       other directive calls over the primary AAR frequency.
3.8. Radar Radiation Restrictions. Do not radiate the mission radar at or below transition
flight level (FL) due to the potential for conflict with Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic that may
pass closer than 650 feet vertically and 1,300 feet horizontally. However, during contingency
operations, emergency situations, and special operations, the mission radar may be radiating at or
below transition flight level within equipment limitations.
3.9. On-Station Procedures.
   3.9.1. Prior to orbit intercept the Nav will brief the AC and MCC of orbit type, radius,
   present altitude and winds aloft over Net 1.
   3.9.2. Fly mission orbits at best endurance indicated airspeed whenever practical but not
   lower than maneuver speed for 30 degrees of bank.
3.10. Aircraft Position Monitoring. Aircraft position relative to a preplanned track is the
responsibility of both the flight and mission crews. Aircraft position and orbit pattern changes
will be coordinated between the MCC, Nav, and AC. The applicable Wing Commander
(WG/CC) may waive the following requirements if deemed necessary to accomplish a specific
mission.
   3.10.1. Flight Crew Procedures:
       3.10.1.1. Pilots will monitor the E-3 position via radio navigational aids and Global
       Positioning System Integrated Navigation System (GINS). The AC will ensure separate
       steering solutions are selected on the AC and CP Control Display Units (CDU).
       3.10.1.2. The Nav, in coordination with the AC, will establish a radio navigation fix or
       line of position between the closest point of the E-3 orbit and the threat area as a “no fly
       beyond line” for all E-3 orbits. This information will be passed to the MCC.
       3.10.1.3. The AC, CP, and Nav positions will be occupied, except for periods of crew
       relief, during flights within 25 NM of an established prohibited area or within 50 NM of a
       potentially hostile border.
 14                                                      AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


      3.10.1.4. When flying in Warning Areas, Military Operating Areas, Restricted Areas, or
      Air Traffic Control (ATC) assigned working areas with other aircraft, the AC and MCC
      are responsible to ensure safe separation between the E-3 and other aircraft
   3.10.2. Mission Crew Procedures:
      3.10.2.1. The MCC must have at least a stand-behind position at an operational console,
      with access to monitor coordination and safety frequencies as required by the mission,
      when a dedicated console is not available.
      3.10.2.2. The AWACS monitor and MCC must maintain awareness of the E-3s position
      and altitude. Their consoles must display the AWACS DATA LINK net participant
      symbol, and they must have a means to determine E-3 altitude for deconfliction purposes.
      If the accuracy of the E-3 symbol is in doubt, consider worst case location, and
      coordinate with the flight deck to take immediate action to reposition the aircraft in order
      to avoid the prohibited/threat areas.
3.11. AWACS Monitor.
   3.11.1. During flight under Due Regard when the mission radar or Identification, Friend or
   Foe (IFF) is operating, the MCC will designate an AWACS monitor to provide traffic
   advisories to the flight crew. At any other time, an AWACS monitor may be utilized as
   determined by the PIC. The AWACS monitor will notify the flight crew and MCC when
   AWACS monitor assumes monitor duties, notify the MCC when monitor responsibility
   changes sections, and notify both the flight crew and MCC whenever AWACS monitor is
   terminated and should provide a brief explanation for the reason of termination. The MCC is
   ultimately responsible for ensuring that there is an AWACS monitor on duty. Normally, the
   Weapons Controller providing Weapons Controller Assisted AR Rendezvous or Weapons
   Controller Directed AR Rendezvous will also perform AWACS monitor responsibilities.
   3.11.2. The AWACS monitor will pass track information with the following parameters or
   as modified by the PIC:
      3.11.2.1. For ATC-controlled airspace: Tracks that are within +1,000 feet (IFF Mode C)
      or 3,000 feet radar measured of E-3 altitude and 15 miles from the E-3, if the track is on a
      heading towards the E-3, overtaking, or passing in front of the E-3.
      3.11.2.2. For uncontrolled airspace: Tracks which are within +3,000 feet of E-3 altitude
      and 15 miles from the E-3, if the track is on a heading towards the E-3, overtaking, or
      passing in front of the E-3.
      3.11.2.3. Traffic advisories will include any climbing/descending and/or maneuvering
      aircraft which could pose a threat to the E-3.
   3.11.3. Pass the tracks to the flight crew over Net 1 giving magnetic bearing (rounded to the
   nearest 10 degrees) Note: To increase situational awareness and promote radio
   communication deconfliction, AWACS monitor will monitor ATC frequency. Range,
   altitude, crossing information about the traffic and whether the track altitude is radar
   measured or IFF reported.
3.12. Transportation of Passengers.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   15


   3.12.1. Space-A Passengers. Space-A passengers will not normally fly on the E-3 due to
   mission and training requirements.
   3.12.2. Responsibility. The crewmember(s) designated by the AC to be responsible for
   passengers or distinguished visitors will:
       3.12.2.1. Supervise passenger movement, especially on the flight line.
       3.12.2.2. Assist passengers in locating assigned seats.
       3.12.2.3. Assist in familiarizing passengers with aircraft interior and survival equipment.
       3.12.2.4. Brief all passengers according to AFI 11-202V3 (using Attachment 3 of this
       publication), prior to engine start.
       3.12.2.5. Assist and direct passengers in the event of an aircraft emergency.
   3.12.3. Loading/Off-loading:
       3.12.3.1. When appropriate, engines on the left side of the aircraft can be shutdown and
       an aircrew member will be positioned at the bottom of the steps to direct loading/off-
       loading operations prior to any passengers entering or departing the aircraft.
       3.12.3.2. If only the left engines are shutdown, the TAXI BACK or an approved
       checklist for the given situation may be used.
   3.12.4. Passenger Comfort. Pilots should make every effort to enhance the comfort of
   passengers. Flight operations should be planned for the minimum use of drag devices and
   maneuvers which might cause discomfort or apprehension.
3.13. Debriefings.
   3.13.1. Conduct the maintenance debriefing as soon as practical after engine shutdown. The
   AC, MCC, FE, ART, CDMT, CT, and any crewmember making an entry in the AFTO Form
   781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, will attend.
   3.13.2. If required, conduct an intelligence debriefing.
   3.13.3. Conduct a crew debriefing.
3.14. Flying Clothing/Equipment.
   3.14.1. All aircrew members will wear or carry the minimum items of clothing and
   equipment according to AFI 11-301V1, AFI 36-3103, AFI 11-202V3, AFOSHSTD 48-20,
   AFOSHSTD 91-100. In addition, all crewmembers will wear flight gloves during critical
   phases of flight as defined by AFI 11-202V3 and supplements except where the flight gloves
   hinder completion of required actions.
   3.14.2. Keep equipment clear of all entry doors, hatches and all emergency equipment
   during all ground and flight operations. The FE, CSO, and ART will ensure that these areas
   are clear of obstructions during their preflight inspection. It is the responsibility of each
   crewmember to store/secure their personal and professional equipment carried onboard.
   Excess personal and professional gear should be secured in the J-compartment, {or as
   directed}.
   3.14.3. Crewmembers will not wear lightweight headsets when entering the lower
   compartments.
 16                                                       AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


3.15. Aircraft Security at Enroute Stops/Destination.
   3.15.1. The AC is responsible for ensuring aircraft security at enroute stops. Secure the
   aircraft as a Protection Level 2 resource IAW AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation
   Security Program, as supplemented by MAJCOM. This requires a US entry controller (at
   least one per every two aircraft) and restricted access. Provide a copy of the flight orders and
   passenger manifest (as applicable) to the entry controller as a way to identify persons
   authorized entry to the aircraft as well as those crewmembers designated by the AC to have
   escort privileges. Perimeter patrol can be accomplished by host nation security, but the entry
   controller must be US security personnel or a US E-3 crewmember. In addition, equipment
   classified as SECRET (that cannot be removed from the aircraft) must be safeguarded by US
   security personnel or a US E-3 crewmember. Only the AC may release security forces from
   guarding the aircraft. Waiver authority is the appropriate WG/CC.
   3.15.2. The MCC, or AC if an MCC is not available, is responsible for the security of
   classified mission documents and software. While deployed or during enroute stops,
   COMSEC and software can be stored on the aircraft when U.S. security personnel are used
   as the entry controller. In the event of a stop at a location where no U.S. security personnel
   are available, COMSEC will be stored in the Command Post or the MCC/AC will designate
   crewmember(s) to remain with the software and COMSEC to provide security.
3.16. Personal Publications Requirements. Personal Publications Requirements. Local units
will issue each crewmember publications IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program as
supplemented. See local supplement to this publication for requirements listing. MAJCOMs
may authorize the use of electronic publications through supplements to this AFI.
3.17. Aircraft Recall/Diversion. Unless received over secure communications, challenge any
recall or diversion of an E-3 using the appropriate authentication for the theater of operation. P-
sorties do not require authentication.
3.18. Transition Training.
   3.18.1. Do not conduct transition when scheduled takeoff or final landing is between 2400L
   and 0600L without SQ/DO approval.
   3.18.2. When performing transition with mission crew on board, the total transition time will
   not exceed 2+30 hours, with the exception of CTs/CSOs on P-sorties. However, do not
   conduct more than 1+30 hours at one time without SQ/DO approval.
   3.18.3. Aircrews may conduct off-station transition if airfield was included in the mission
   planning conducted prior to flight and approval was obtained by SQ/DO (or higher
   authority).
       3.18.3.1. Aircrew may “drop-in” to airfields designated as “familiar” in local
       supplements without pre-flight mission planning/approval. The PIC will ensure current
       NOTAMS are reviewed, be familiar with the airfield, and coordinate with SQ/DO (or
       higher authority) prior to commencing descent to the airfield.
   3.18.4. Transition duty day is a period of 12 hours that starts and runs concurrently with the
   maximum flight duty periods and applies to all flight crewmembers. Transition may be
   accomplished with additional crewmembers onboard who have exceeded transition duty day
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   17


   provided they are not occupying their primary flight crew duty position or performing flight
   crew instructor or Stan Eval Flight Examiner (SEFE) duties.
       3.18.4.1. The OG/CC can approve requests to extend transition duty day to 16 hours. 513
       ACG may perform transition training on local training missions provided duty day does
       not exceed 16 hours and actual flying time does not exceed 12 hours.
3.19. Crew Coordination Drills. Thoroughly plan, brief and practice simulated crew
coordination drills (i.e. Ditching, Crash Landing, Loss of Pressurization, Nuclear Event, Smoke
or Fumes, and Fuselage Fire drills) during each training sortie when mission profile allows. The
following procedures apply:
   3.19.1. The AC and MCC will coordinate prior to initiation, and make every effort to inform
   all instructors and evaluators of crew coordination drill timing in order to maximize training.
   3.19.2. Operational requirements will not be interrupted.
   3.19.3. Doors and hatches will not be opened and equipment will not be powered down.
   However, if a simulated crew coordination drill is performed after calling “off station,” a
   normal equipment power down may be incorporated into the drill in anticipation of landing
   the aircraft.
   3.19.4. If passengers are onboard during the drill, passengers will be briefed but will not
   participate.
   3.19.5. The AC will make a Public Address (PA) announcement at the start of the crew
   coordination drill vulnerability period, upon execution of the drill, and at the conclusion of
   the drill.
3.20. Aircraft Cleanliness. It is the AC and MCC‟s responsibility to ensure the aircraft is clean
and orderly after a mission. All crewmembers are responsible for removing or stowing their
personal and professional items prior to departing the aircraft.
3.21. Aircraft Configuration for Static Display. Whenever an E-3 is on static display and
opened for viewing, there will be a passenger stand at each open door. Hatches will only be
opened when an aircrew member is positioned at the hatch. ACs will ensure proper
safety/security precautions are taken to protect the aircraft, passengers and crew. AFI 11-209
and command supplements concerning participation in static displays and aerial events provide
further guidance.
3.22. Readiness Postures.
   3.22.1. Types of Alert.
       3.22.1.1. Readiness Posture One (RP-1) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of
       launching in 1 hour from notification. Crews designated for RP-1 alert duty should
       normally be housed in a designated alert facility. 12 hours of pre-alert crew rest is
       required prior to assuming RP-1 alert.
       3.22.1.2. Readiness Posture Three (RP-3) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of
       launching in 3 hours from notification. 12 hours of pre-alert crew rest is required prior to
       assuming RP-3 alert.
18                                                     AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


     3.22.1.3. Readiness Posture Fifteen (RP-15) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of
     launching 15 hours after notification. The RP-15 crew will be present for normal duty
     each day and carry pagers and/or cell phones for notification. Crew rest begins after
     notification.
  3.22.2. Maximum flight duty period for RP-1, RP-3. Maximum flight duty period for
  RP-1 and RP-3 crews is 12 hours. RP-1/RP-3 flight duty period extensions will be IAW
  MAJCOM Supplement to AFI 11-202V3.
  3.22.3. Alert duty scheduling, flight duty on alert, and maximum number of days on alert
  will be IAW MAJCOM Sup to AFI 11-202V3.
  3.22.4. Post-Alert Compensation Time.
     3.22.4.1. If alert duty is performed away from normal quarters (e.g. alert facility or
     billeting) for a period of 96 hours or more, compensation time off will be 1 day for every
     4 days on alert duty, unless waived by the applicable group commander or designated
     representative.
     3.22.4.2. No compensatory time is authorized if alert duty was performed in normal
     quarters.

                      FLIGHT CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

4.1. Adverse Weather.
   4.1.1. Icing Restrictions. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited.
   Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be
   avoided. Note: Air Force Weather Agency technical notice AFWA/TN 98/002,
   Meteorological Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and
   freezing rain is equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrew
   will confirm with the local weather agency what type of icing is associated with the freezing
   fog.
      4.1.1.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing precipitation IAW 11-202V3
      paragraph 5.26.6.
      4.1.1.2. Freezing/frozen precipitation (freezing rain, drizzle, snow, fog, or temperatures
      near 0o C, etc.) may cause ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an
      aircraft requires deicing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          4.1.1.2.1. Flight crew will be familiar with and follow all procedures and restrictions
          in T.O. 1E-3A-1, Flight Manual and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1, Performance Manual, with
          respect to de-ice/anti-ice procedures. Further guidance is provided in T.O. 42C-1-2,
          Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures.
          4.1.1.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
          icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-
          icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW T.O. 42C-1-2
          and AFFSA (FAA) holdover tables located at the AFFSA website. The holdover time
          begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and is affected by intensity/type of
          precipitation, time, temperature, and type/dilution of mixture. PIC shall use this
          information to determine when holdover time is exceeded and re-apply fluid if
          required.
          4.1.1.2.3. The PIC will ensure the following information (4-element code) is received
          from the deicing ground crew after anti-icing is complete:
              4.1.1.2.3.1. Element A. Element A specifies the type of anti-icing fluid (e.g.
              Type IV).
              4.1.1.2.3.2. Element B. Element B specifies the percentage of fluid within the
              fluid/water mixture (e.g. 75/25 is 75% fluid and 25% water).
              4.1.1.2.3.3. Element C. Element C specifies the time of the beginning of the
              anti-icing step. All holdover times are based on this value. All times are based on
              Local (L) time.
              4.1.1.2.3.4. Element D. Element D specifies the date (day, written month, year).
              The date will be consistent with local time.
 20                                                      AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


          4.1.1.2.4. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection is completed within 5
          minutes of departure.
   4.1.2. Turbulence Restrictions. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence
   is prohibited. Every effort will be made to avoid areas of reported moderate turbulence. If
   moderate turbulence is forecast along the planned route of flight, the AC will coordinate with
   weather personnel as to the best course of action to vacate the condition, if encountered.
      4.1.2.1. Crews should confirm type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what
      type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of
      flight.
      4.1.2.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all aircrew/passengers are seated, with seat
      belts fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or
      anticipated. Warning: Serious injury may occur if aircrew/passengers do not have their
      seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   4.1.3. Thunderstorm Avoidance. Pilots will neither file a flight plan nor fly into an area of
   known or forecasted thunderstorm activity when the weather radar is inoperative or unusable
   and thunderstorm activity cannot be visually circumnavigated. During flight, avoid
   thunderstorms by at least:
      4.1.3.1. 20 NM at or above FL 230.
      4.1.3.2. 10 NM below FL 230.
      4.1.3.3. In the vicinity of the airport, maintain at least 5 NM separation from heavy rain
      showers. Note: Approaches or departures may be authorized by the appropriate group
      commander if thunderstorms are officially observed to be closer than 10 NM (but not less
      than 5 NM) from the airport. IAW AFI 11-202V3, the thunderstorm must not be
      producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds, gust fronts,
      heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and must not be forecast or observed
      to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned missed
      approach corridor, if applicable).
   4.1.4. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
      4.1.4.1. Within ± 8oC or ± 5,000 feet of the freezing level.
      4.1.4.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
      thunderstorm activity.
   4.1.5. Temperature Correction. For all flight operations, temperature corrections to
   published altitudes shall be applied IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the chart provided in the Flight
   Information Handbook (FIH) to ensure adequate obstacle clearance.
   4.1.6. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
   be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
      4.1.6.1. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the forecast surface winds
      (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR.
4.2. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD)/Restrictions.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                21


  4.2.1. A flight engineer will compute all initial takeoff and landing data during mission
  planning utilizing an authorized TOLD computer program or T.O. 1E-3A-1-1, Flight Manual
  Performance Data – E-3B, E-3C. A pilot or additional flight engineer will crosscheck this
  data using the computer program or T.O. 1E-3A-1-1. Either the initial computation or
  crosscheck of TOLD data will be done using the T.O. 1E-3A-1-1 or FPS.
     4.2.1.1. The applicable group commander may authorize use of Misson Accomplishment
     Planning Methods, IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1-1, when operational/contingency missions
     dictate.
  4.2.2. Rolling Takeoffs. Rolling takeoffs are authorized (and with a crosswind component
  above 20 knots required) IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1, Flight Manual, E-3B & E-3C Aircraft. Make
  rolling takeoffs whenever appropriate.
  4.2.3. Reduced Power Takeoffs. The following information is provided in addition to that
  found in T.O. 1E-3A-1-1:
     4.2.3.1. Whenever practical, a reduced power takeoff should be made.
     4.2.3.2. Actual inboard takeoff rated thrust (TRT) will be displayed on the inboard
     exhaust pressure ratio (EPR) bugs for quick reference in the event TRT is required.
     4.2.3.3. Reduced thrust takeoffs may be accomplished on a wet runway provided the
     runway is free of snow, ice, and slush.
     4.2.3.4. Reduced thrust takeoffs are permitted with falling precipitation provided
     precipitation is not moderate to heavy.
  4.2.4. Tailwind Takeoffs. Takeoffs with tailwinds are not recommended unless required by
  operational considerations. If a tailwind takeoff is made, a maximum component of 10 knots
  may exist provided data does not exceed allowable T.O. 1E-3A-1-1 limits..
  4.2.5. Crosswind.
     4.2.5.1. Unless further restricted by aircraft gross weight or emergency conditions, the
     maximum crosswind component (gust included) for takeoff and landing with RCR 26/23
     is 25 knots, RCR 15 is 20 knots, RCR 10 is 15 knots. If RCR falls between the above
     RCR values, use next lower RCR restrictions. Operation at higher crosswind values
     requires specific approval by applicable group commander.
     4.2.5.2. Copilots are limited to a maximum takeoff/landing component of 15 knots
     unless under IP/SEFE supervision.
  4.2.6. Runway and Taxiway. IAW MAJCOM directives, minimum runway length and
  width for takeoff or landing is 7,000 x 135 feet unless waived by OG/CC. Minimum taxiway
  width is 75 feet unless waived by OG/CC.
     4.2.6.1. Aircraft will normally takeoff and land on the longest suitable runway available.
     4.2.6.2. Intersection takeoffs are not recommended and will not be performed unless
     operational necessity dictates. In such a situation, follow MAJCOM directives.
  4.2.7. Runway Condition Reading (RCR). Aircraft will not takeoff or land when reported
  RCR is less than 10. The applicable OG/CC has the authority to waiver the minimum RCR
 22                                                      AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


   to 7 when operational necessity warrants. Do not conduct aircraft ground operations to
   include taxi and towing with a RCR less than 7.
   4.2.8. Noise Abatement. IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1 and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1 guidance. An engine
   failure or other emergency condition during takeoff is a non-normal condition and takes
   precedence over published noise abatement procedures.
   4.2.9. Landings. Except in emergency situations, the following apply:
      4.2.9.1. Computed landing distance plus 1,000 feet must not exceed runway available.
      4.2.9.2. Full stop landings with less than 40 degrees of flaps are not permitted.
      4.2.9.3. If it appears that the actual touchdown will occur beyond the first 1/3 or 3,000
      feet (whichever is less) of the runway length, pilots will go-around.
      4.2.9.4. Make no more than one full stop in a 30 minute period. When performing taxi
      back type operations and/or multiple full stop landings, observe brake limitations and
      cooling procedures IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1 and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1.
   4.2.10. Missed Approach. Prior to starting an instrument approach, the AC will ensure
   performance complies with missed approach climb gradient requirements IAW AFI 11-
   202V3. For planning purposes, base performance on the expected go-around configuration.
4.3. Takeoff and Landing Policy.
   4.3.1. Aircraft Commander Responsibilities.
      4.3.1.1. A qualified AC will make all takeoffs and landings from the left seat when either
      of the following conditions exist:
          4.3.1.1.1. When weather is below 300‟ ceiling and 1 statute mile (SM) visibility.
          4.3.1.1.2. A distinguished visitor (Code 4, Code 4 equivalent, or higher) is on board
          as a passenger. NOTE: IPs may takeoff or land in either seat under the conditions
          above; however, a copilot will not occupy the left seat.
          4.3.1.1.3. An AC, IP, or SEFE will make all approaches and landings during aircraft
          emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
   4.3.2. Copilot Takeoffs and Landings.
      4.3.2.1. Copilots may perform takeoff and landings if the weather is at least 300-feet
      ceiling and 1 SM visibility, or published minimums, whichever is higher.
      4.3.2.2. During takeoffs and landings CPs must be properly supervised by an IP/SEFE or
      certified AC.
          4.3.2.2.1. An AC must have 100 primary CMR hours in order to be certified to
          supervise Copilot takeoffs and landings, recommendation from an IP, and SQ/CC
          approval.
      4.3.2.3. CPs must be certified by the SQ/CC as “experienced” in order to accomplish
      takeoffs and/or landings under the supervision of an experienced AC with passengers
      onboard (no DVs Code 4 or higher).
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    23


4.4. Touch-and-Go Landings. Accomplish touch-and-go landings under the following
conditions:
   4.4.1. IP/SEFE supervision.
   4.4.2. Minimum weather required is 300‟ ceiling and 1 SM visibility.
   4.4.3. Crosswind component does not exceed the following (including gusts): Dry runway--
   15 knots; wet runway--10 knots.
   4.4.4. No passengers on board.
      4.4.4.1. The following are not considered passengers for this restriction: Wing
      supervisors, E-3 maintenance personnel, USAF Aircrew qualified in other aircraft,
      AFA/AFROTC cadets, FAA/ATC personnel, weapons directors, ACC TRSS Detachment
      6 personnel not on aeronautical orders, Airborne Command Element (ACE) team
      members, mission essential ground personnel (MEGP), Security Forces, Intelligence
      personnel, and US customs personnel flying under the provisions of AFI 11-401 and
      MAJCOM supplement.
      4.4.4.2. The following are not considered passengers for this restriction with applicable
      group commander approval prior to takeoff: military members not on aeronautical orders
      who are awaiting training, Computer Support Group (CSG) personnel conducting inflight
      software testing, and Mission Crew Training (MCT) and Flight Crew Training (FCT)
      contract instructors in direct support of training and operations.
   4.4.5. The following length/width criteria apply: Dry runway--9,000 feet x 135 feet
   minimum; wet runway--10,000 feet x 135 feet minimum. On a wet runway, touchdown in
   the first 2,000 feet of the runway or initiate a go-around.
   4.4.6. On wet runways, conduct touch-and-go landings at flaps 50 degrees only. On wet
   runways, display the actual charted go-around EPR on the inboard EPR “bugs” for quick
   reference in the event go-around EPR is required while airborne. Outboard EPR “bugs”
   should display 1.50 EPR. Wet runway touch-and-go landings are permitted with falling
   precipitation (i.e., drizzle or light rain), provided the precipitation is not moderate to heavy,
   not producing a runway surface condition (RSC), and it can be determined that water is not
   pooling on the runway.
   4.4.7. Runway is free of all snow, ice, and slush. This does not preclude touch-and-go
   landings provided the RCR is reported as 10 or higher. The 962 AACS will use the
   following procedures: landing surface (67.5 feet left and right of centerline) is completely
   clear of slush and the minimum RCR reading for any portion of the runway is 10.
4.5. Inflight Simulated Emergency/Engine-Out Procedures.
   4.5.1. Inflight, prior to simulated emergency procedures, the IP/AC must alert all
   crewmembers in the cockpit.
   4.5.2. In an actual emergency, all student pilot/copilot training and simulated emergency
   procedures will be terminated. Training will resume only when the AC has determined that
   no hazard to safe aircraft operation exists.
   4.5.3. Except for simulated engine-out landings, restore all aircraft systems to normal
   operation prior to landing.
 24                                                       AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


   4.5.4. IP/SEFE supervision is required for all touch-and-go‟s, flaps 14, flaps 25, and flaps 25
   to 50 approaches/landing. Prior to performing a flaps 14 approach/landing, update the brake
   energy limited landing weight and landing distance limited landing weight and brief
   differences to normal configuration habit patterns, emphasizing gear lowering sequence.
   4.5.5. Simulated engine-out maneuver restrictions (inflight):
       4.5.5.1. Simulated engine-out takeoffs are prohibited.
       4.5.5.2. Simulated two-engine operations are prohibited.
       4.5.5.3. Do not accomplish actual engine shutdown inflight. A reduction in thrust can
       adequately simulate training in aircraft control procedures.
       4.5.5.4. Limit all inflight simulated engine-out activity to a gross weight of 270,000 lbs
       or less, with rudder boost on.
       4.5.5.5. Pilots performing simulated engine-out touch-and-gos will follow normal four-
       engine takeoff procedures.
       4.5.5.6. No passengers on board. Do not consider Flight Crew Training (FCT) contract
       instructors in direct support of training and operations as passengers for this restriction.
       4.5.5.7. ACs/FPs certified to do so by their SQ/CC, IAW local supplements, may
       accomplish simulated engine-out missed approaches, go-arounds, and full-stop landings
       in VMC (day or night) without IP/SEFE supervision.
       4.5.5.8. All planned simulated engine-out missed approaches/go-arounds will be initiated
       no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown.
       4.5.5.9. During a simulated engine-out approach, if an unplanned go-around or missed
       approach is executed, establish symmetrical thrust on all engines when safe and practical.
       4.5.5.10. Aircraft in day IMC require weather conditions at or above published circling
       minimums for the approach to be flown.
       4.5.5.11. Aircraft at night require weather conditions at or above 1,000 ft. ceiling and 2
       SMs visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Landing Attitude Demonstrations. Landing attitude demonstrations may only be
accomplished by IP/SEFE‟s or ACs under IP/SEFE supervision. The following restrictions
apply:
   4.6.1. Must be accomplished four engine only.
   4.6.2. Dry runway only.
   4.6.3. Flaps 40 or 50 only.
   4.6.4. Normal dry runway touch-and-go conditions and restrictions apply.
   4.6.5. Go-around will be initiated if aircraft touches down during the initial roundout.
   4.6.6. Go-around will be initiated with no less than 4,000 feet of runway remaining.
4.7. Preflight.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     25


   4.7.1. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) will normally be enabled at all
   times.
   4.7.2. AUTONAV will normally be enabled for INU ground alignment.
   4.7.3. To comfirm proper INU alignment, the Nav will check the INU true headings prior to
   engine start and confirm they are within 1 degree of each other and cross-checked with the
   Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS).
4.8. Engine Start/Taxi.
   4.8.1. When using a motorized staircase vehicle (Very Importatnt Person (VIP) Stand or
   “Air Stairs”), aircrews will close entry doors prior to the removal or placement of the stands.
   4.8.2. The occupants of both pilot seats will have their seat belt fastened while taxiing and
   will also wear their shoulder harness during critical phases of flight.
   4.8.3. Taxi speed in the parking area or any congested area will be slow enough to
   accommodate a wing walker.
   4.8.4. The navigator will monitor GINS ground speed during taxi operations.
   4.8.5. The navigator will use the weather radar to scan the departure path prior to takeoff to
   avoid flying into areas of heavy precipitation and/or possible associated turbulence.
   4.8.6. At the hammerhead, flight crews will verify the accuracy of the GINS position.
4.9. Frequency Monitoring. The AC, CP, Nav, and FE will monitor the briefed primary radio
frequency during all phases of flight unless directed otherwise by the AC. The AC will ensure
VHF guard (if available), UHF guard, and mission interphone are monitored at all times. During
critical phases of flight and during periods of high pilot workloads, pilots should monitor only
the frequency required for flight operations (tower, departure, approach etc.). C2 or other
frequencies to be monitored will be designated by the AC. The observer‟s seat occupant will be
briefed on the relationship between the AC‟s Audio Distribution System (ADS) and the
observer‟s interphone to prevent extraneous radio transmissions.
4.10. Altitude Monitoring. When climbing or descending, the pilot not flying or the navigator
will call 1,000 feet above/below and approaching level off (within 200 ft) altitude. While
operating at less than 2,000 feet above the ground, the pilot not flying the aircraft will inform the
pilot at the controls anytime the indicated altitude varies more than 100 feet from the desired
altitude, or if the aircraft appears to be dangerously close to terrain or obstructions. The
navigator will back up the pilots in observing and reporting these deviations.
4.11. Departure.
   4.11.1. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight
   Procedures, this chapter, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. During mission
   planning, the flight crew will determine a gross weight that ensures E-3 performance will
   meet or exceed departure requirements. Note: In the event E-3 performance is unable to
   meet the published climb gradient at the desired gross weight, down load fuel, use other
   applicable approved methods described below, or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
   4.11.2. Vertically Clear all Obstacles. Crews will calculate climb gradient data using TO 1-
   3A-1-1 to ensure they are able to meet the 200 ft/nm or required published climb gradient. If
 26                                                      AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


   the performance required to accomplish the mission cannot be achieved, and with OG/CC
   approval, crews can subtract 48 ft/nm from the published climb gradient. If required
   performance still can‟t be achieved crews may use SDPs, with OG/CC approval. Note:
   OG/CCs may delegate approval authority down to the SQ/CC or DO as specified in the unit‟s
   supplement.
   4.11.3. Special Departure Procedures (SDP) use and certification (IAW AFI 11-202V3).
      4.11.3.1. E-3 crews are authorized to use SDPs.
          4.11.3.1.1. The applicable OG will determine who can approve the use of a SDP.
          4.11.3.1.2. Crews must be certified to use SDPs. The SDP Training PPT dated 11
          Mar 11 (or newer versions) is the MAJCOMs approved training materials and is
          available from OGV. Upon completion of training the individuals training folder will
          be appropriately annotated.
      4.11.3.2. Current E-3 SDPs are retrieved from the Jeppesen AF Opsdata website
      http://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/index.jsp?section=gms&content=gms_home.jsp.
      User ID and password are available from OGV upon training completion.
          4.11.3.2.1. Adhoc requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through
          applicable OGV NLT 72 hours prior to scheduled departure. „Ad hoc‟ SDPs are
          valid for seven (7) days after the analysis date. The SDP analysis date is located in
          the upper left-hand corner of the takeoff performance sheet.
   4.11.4. Screen Heights (SH). Required SHs are, in essence, obstacles and will be treated as
   such for performance calculations. Flight crews will ensure the calculated CFL allows the E-
   3 to cross the departure end of runway at or above the required SH. SH requirements for
   departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
   departure is being flown. Reference FLIP, AFMAN 11-217V1, and when available, the SDP
   performance page.
   4.11.5. Published low close-in obstacles. Climb gradients do not take into account
   “published low close-in obstacles” (obstacles or terrain 200‟ Above Ground Level (AGL)
   and below within one nautical mile from departure end of runway). These obstacles should
   normally be published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). The
   AC will ensure all applicable published low close-in obstacles along the departure flight path
   will be safely cleared. Crews should exercise caution when determining not to consider a
   published low close-in obstacle and realize there are factors that could result in a greater
   deviation from intended track centerline (i.e. high crosswinds, low ceiling/visibility, etc.).
   Note: Distance to published low close-in obstacles includes unused runway past CFL.
4.12. Enroute Navigation.
   4.12.1. Normally plan for maximum use of E-3 navigation equipment by flying great circle
   routes. Random Area Navigation (RNAV)/direct routing may be flown according to FLIP,
   General Planning. Navigators will annotate changes to the route of flight on the
   Navigational chart (unless safety of flight dictates). Revised ETA‟s will be computed and
   the ETA to significant events will be briefed to the AC and MCC. Any waypoints or
   patterns entered into the navigation system will be crosschecked by an additional flight crew
   member.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 27


  4.12.2. The navigator will accomplish periodic crosschecks of navigation equipment,
  intended route, and cleared route to identify navigation errors, prevent inadvertent deviations
  and ensure the equipment is performing within tolerances. This crosscheck will additionally
  be performed: after level-off, prior to air refueling, prior to orbit intercept, and when
  assuming station. The AC (and MCC as required) will be immediately notified of any
  discrepancies/ malfunctions.
  4.12.3. Special Qualification Airspace Navigation. Both Required Navigation Performance
  (RNP) Airspace and Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace are
  considered special qualification airspace. The E-3 is approved for operation in RNP airspace
  with operational limitations based on GINS navigational equipment. The following are E-3
  CNS/ATM Certifications: RVSM, TCAS II v 7.0 (ACAS II), RNP-5, BRNAV, RNP-10,
  NAT MNPS (RNP-12.6), VHF-Nav FM Immunity, and 8.33 kHz VHF. Reference FLIP GP
  and the following guidance for RNP and RVSM requirements:
     4.12.3.1. RNP-10 compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10 NM of actual
     position 95 percent of the time.
         4.12.3.1.1. The E-3 may operate in RNP-10 airspace without time limits when “GPS-
         only” or “GPS/INS-blended” mode of navigation is selected. The E-3 may operate in
         RNP-10 airspace in “INS-only” mode for 6.2 hours from the time the Embedded GPS
         INUs (EGIs) were commanded to the NAV mode or the last aligned, whichever is
         later.
         4.12.3.1.2. Updates will be IAW RNP/Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) update and
         contingency procedures in this volume.
  4.12.4. BRNAV (RNP-5) Airspace. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 5 NM
  of actual position 95 percent of the time. BRNAV accuracy criteria is RNP-5.
     4.12.4.1. The E-3 may operate in BRNAV (RNP-5) airspace without time limits when
     “GPS-only” or “GPS/INS-blended” mode of navigation is selected. The E-3 may be
     operated in BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace in “INS-only” mode for 2.0 hours from the time the
     EGIs were commanded to the NAV mode or the last aligned, whichever is later.
  4.12.5. RNP/BRNAV Flight Planning. The PIC will review airspace requirements (i.e.
  specific RNP level and contingency actions, etc.) and assess mission impact when flying in
  RNP-10/BRNAV (RNP-5) airspace.
     4.12.5.1. Enroute. At the RNP/BRNAV entry point both EGIs must be operational and
     RAIM must be ON and operational. Periodic crosschecks of all available navigation
     sources, intended route, and cleared route will be accomplished to identify navigation
     errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the
     deterioration or failure of navigation equipment below navigation performance
     requirements and coordinate appropriate actions.
  4.12.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is
  applied is considered special qualification airspace.
     4.12.6.1. RVSM Equipment. Both primary altimeters, the autopilot (to include the
     altitude hold function), the altitude alerter system, and the IFF transponder must be fully
 28                                                      AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


      operational before entry into RVSM airspace. Before entering RVSM airspace advise
      ATC of any RVSM equipment failures and request a new clearance.
          4.12.6.1.1. Autopilot. The autopilot shall be engaged during level cruise except when
          circumstances such as the need to re-trim the aircraft require disengagement.
          4.12.6.1.2. Altimeters. Altimeters will be crosschecked ever hour to ensure they
          agree + 200 ft.
          4.12.6.1.3. Should any of the required equipment fail after entry into RVSM
          airspace, immediately notify ATC and coordinate a plan of action.
      4.12.6.2. RVSM Operations. Continuously monitor systems and crosscheck altimeters to
      ensure they agree ± 200 ft.
          4.12.6.2.1. Aircrews should limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute
          when operating in the vicinity of other aircraft to reduce potential effects on traffic
          collision avoidance system (TCAS) operations.
   4.12.7. Trans-oceanic flights. To minimize trans-oceanic gross navigational errors (GNE),
   Navs will accomplish a coast out/in fix during trans-oceanic flights or when the aircraft is
   operating out of radio aid range. For trans-oceanic flights navigators will compute an equal
   time point (ETP). Additionally, the Nav will annotate the time over an oceanic checkpoint
   on the Navigational chart. The aircraft heading will be crosschecked with the planned
   heading. The Nav will annotate the aircraft position on the navigational chart approximately
   10 minutes after each oceanic waypoint is passed.
4.13. On-Station.
   4.13.1. The CSO will normally control the use of HF 1. The AC will coordinate with the
   CSO if the flight crew requires its use. The MCC/CSO will coordinate with the AC if the
   mission crew requires the use of either of the flight crew‟s VHF or UHF radios.
   4.13.2. Pilots and navigators will closely monitor the first complete trip around the orbit
   after initial intercept to ensure the aircraft is maintaining proper orbit.
   4.13.3. The AC has the responsibility and final authority for determining when the aircraft
   should depart station. ACs will consider forecast enroute and destination weather, enroute
   winds, icing, mission requirements, fuel requirements, training requirements, etc.
      4.13.3.1. Within 1 hour after assuming station or refueling, the flight crew will compute
      “bingo fuel” and report remaining station time to the MCC. If AAR is planned after
      orbit, make a similar computation allowing enough fuel so that in the event of a missed
      AAR, the aircraft can land at the destination or a preplanned alternate with the required
      fuel minimums. Bingo fuel computations will not include center wing tank fuel used as
      ballast to maintain center of gravity (c.g.) forward of 35% mean aerodynamic chord
      (MAC).
      4.13.3.2. If fuel requirements necessitate a modification to on-station duration, pattern,
      or altitude, the AC will notify the MCC.
      4.13.3.3. Make a weather check no later than 2 hours prior to estimated time of departure
      (ETD) from the orbit area (or prior to ETA if enroute). This check will include enroute,
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                  29


      refueling track, landing base, and alternate base (if required) weather. Crews will use all
      available weather sources to keep abreast of changes.
      4.13.3.4. Crews should fly an alternate mission in lieu of dumping fuel to adjust gross
      weight should an equipment malfunction or an inability to complete an assigned mission
      occur. Alternate missions should be planned and briefed during mission planning day.
4.14. Arrival and Approach.
   4.14.1. Approach Briefing. Prior to starting descent from cruise altitude, the pilot flying the
   approach will brief the crew IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1 and AFMAN 11-217V1 requirements.
   During an approach, the AC, CP or FP, and Nav will each have a separate Terminal
   Approach Procedure or Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) booklet available for use
   during the descent briefing and to reference during the approach. The pilot not flying the
   approach and the Nav will monitor their respective instruments and all radio transmissions by
   the controlling agency, and advise the pilot making the approach when noting any deviation
   from the prescribed procedures or instructions.
   4.14.2. Instrument Approach Advisory Calls. The pilot monitoring the approach will make
   the following advisory calls:
      4.14.2.1. Non-Precision Approaches:
          4.14.2.1.1. 100 feet above minimum descent altitude (MDA).
          4.14.2.1.2. “Minimums” at MDA.
          4.14.2.1.3. “Runway in sight.” Make this call when the runway environment is in
          sight. Do not call too soon when obstructions to vision such as fog, haze, low stratus
          clouds, etc., are present.
          4.14.2.1.4. “Visual descent point (VDP).”
          4.14.2.1.5. “Missed Approach Point,” (MAP), if applicable.
      4.14.2.2. Precision Approaches:
          4.14.2.2.1. 100 feet above decision height (DH).
          4.14.2.2.2. “Runway in sight.” Make this call when the runway environment is in
          sight. Do not call too soon when obstructions to vision such as fog, haze, low stratus
          clouds, etc., are present.
          4.14.2.2.3. “Decision height.”
      4.14.2.3. The navigator will monitor altitude and report deviations.
      4.14.2.4. The pilot flying the aircraft will:
          4.14.2.4.1. Acknowledge all advisory calls over interphone.
          4.14.2.4.2. Announce intentions over interphone at the appropriate decision point for
          both instrument and visual approaches (i.e. “Crew we‟re going to land/go-
          around/touch-and-go”).
   4.14.3. Priorities. Upon commencing the final approach (glideslope interception or
   departing the final approach fix [FAF]), flight deck crewmembers will avoid unnecessary
 30                                                        AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


   distractions. Priorities will be monitoring the approach/landing and completing the BEFORE
   LANDING checklist. All activities not associated with the approach/landing checklist
   accomplishment will cease.
4.15. Simulator Only Maneuvers. The following maneuvers will be practiced in the flight
simulator only:
   4.15.1. Aborted takeoff.
   4.15.2. Engine failure(s) during takeoff and/or climbout to traffic pattern altitude.
   4.15.3. Two-engine operations (cruise, approach, go-around, and/or landing).
   4.15.4. Three-engine rudder boost out operations (cruise, approach, go-around, and/or
   landing).
   4.15.5. Initial Buffet/Stick Shaker Recovery.
   4.15.6. Unusual Attitudes.
   4.15.7. Flaps-up landing and touch and go.
4.16. Occupancy of Flight Crew Duty Positions.
   4.16.1. ACs and FPs may perform their duties from either seat. CPs must be certified by the
   SQ/CC IAW local supplements in order to perform duties in the AC position during critical
   phases of flight and then may do so only under IP/SEFE supervision.
   4.16.2. During non-critical phases of flight, if the AC or CP leaves the flight deck, the FE
   position must be occupied by a qualified FE or be supervised by an instructor/SEFE FE.
   4.16.3. During critical phases of flight or simulated/actual emergencies, unqualified pilots or
   pilots not in training to achieve qualification in the E-3, will not occupy any flight crew duty
   position. Rated pilot General/Flag officers flying under provisions of MAJCOM guidance
   are exempt. Waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3.
4.17. Midair Collision Avoidance.
   4.17.1. Man all flight deck seats below FL 180 to the maximum extent practical. Crews will
   maintain an IFR clearance for separation and use autopilot whenever practical. The
   navigator and pilots will use the weather radar when possible to search for traffic. The
   observer, when available, will be on headset and actively scan for traffic.
   4.17.2. Make seat changes for the AC or CP position with the autopilot and altitude hold
   engaged if practical.   Initiate seat changes while stabilized in the IFR traffic pattern,
   extended VFR traffic pattern or when above 10,000 feet MSL during climbs and descents.
   Emphasize clearing during the seat change.
   4.17.3. TCAS operation will be IAW AFI 11-202V3.
4.18. Equipment on the Flight Deck. Hold crew equipment and publications on the flight deck
to a minimum commensurate with mission requirements. Stowed equipment must not prevent
rapid egress from the flight deck.
4.19. In-flight Meals. The AC and CP should not eat meals at the same time and their meals
should consist of different menu items if prepared by the same flight kitchen or organization.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    31


4.20. Fuel Requirements. For planning purposes, fuel reserves on all flights will be 18,000
pounds over the destination (or alternate when required) initial approach fix, or IAW AFI 11-
202V3, whichever is greater. Fuels listed herein are minimum required fuels. The PIC may plan
to arrive overhead with more fuel based on the dynamics of the mission (e.g. weather enroute,
airport enviroment, etc).
   4.20.1. Fuel required at the initial approach fix at the original destination will allow a
   penetration and one approach, then climb to optimum altitude and arrival over the alternate
   initial approach fix with 18,000 pounds of fuel or greater.
   4.20.2. Minimum landing fuel for flights on an IFR clearance is 15,000 pounds. “Minimum
   Fuel” will normally be declared to the controlling agency when it is determined the aircraft
   may land at the intended destination with 15,000 pounds of fuel remaining or less. However,
   if the destination airfield is VFR, and after the aircraft is established in the airfield‟s radar
   and/or visual traffic pattern, practice approaches and landings may be conducted until 12,000
   pounds of fuel remain, provided CG limits are not exceeded or weather conditions deteriorate
   below VFR.
   4.20.3. “Emergency Fuel” will be declared to the controlling agency when it is determined
   the aircraft may land at the intended destination with 10,000 pounds of fuel or less.
   4.20.4. Normal Fuel Requirements are as follows:
   4.20.4.1. Initial Approach Fix. 18,000 pounds.
       4.20.4.2. Minimum Fuel. 12,000 pounds.
       4.20.4.3. Emergency Fuel. 8,000 pounds.
   4.20.5. When mission requirements dictate and when specifically approved by the applicable
   group commander, fuel reserves may be reduced (provided they meet or exceed AFI 11-
   202V3 requirements) to the following: Initial Approach Fix-12,000 pounds, Minimum Fuel-
   10,000 pounds, Emergency Fuel-8,000 pounds.
4.21. Aircraft Ground Refueling. FEs are authorized to refuel the aircraft at bases where E-3
maintenance support is not available. When refueling/defueling aircraft, FEs will comply with
T.O. 1E-3A-2-7-5CL-1, Refueling and Defueling, T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft
and Static Grounding/Bonding and T.O. 1E-3A-2-7, Ground Handling-Servicing and Airframe
USAF Series E-3B and E-3C.
   4.21.1. Anytime adequate portable fire fighting equipment is unavailable or any condition
   listed under Abnormal Conditions, Section 1, T.O. 00-25-172 exists, the FE will notify the
   local fire department. The fire department will be informed of the abnormal condition and
   parking spot/ location of aircraft. The FE should be informed by the fire chief of the
   estimated response time or if a standby fire truck needs to be in position prior to servicing.
   Communication capability will be immediately available.
   4.21.2. In the event base support is limited or nonexistent, other crewmembers may be used
   as refueling team members at the discretion of the AC. The flight engineer will brief all team
   members on the use of fire equipment, safety precautions, and emergency shutdown
   procedures.
 32                                                         AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


4.22. Fuel Jettisoning. Conduct fuel dumping only to reduce gross weight in an emergency or
for operational necessity. When circumstances permit, dump above 5,000 feet AGL over
unpopulated areas or in designated fuel dump areas. Advise the appropriate air traffic control
agency of intentions, altitude, and location when fuel is jettisoned and when the operation is
complete. Make the appropriate entry on the AFTO Forms 781A/H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight
Status and Maintenance Document.
4.23. Aircraft Interior Lighting. During ground/flight operation, it is recommended to keep
flight deck lighting at the lowest practical level. During night parking, do not use the high level
flight deck lighting until after the aircraft is chocked and brakes are released. This will allow the
pilots to ensure that the aircraft does not roll.
4.24. Inflight Engine Failure. During peacetime training missions, if an engine is shutdown in
flight, terminate the mission and land as soon as practical, IAW TO 1E-3A-1. During
contingency operations, if an engine is shutdown in flight, mission requirements may necessitate
continuing the sortie unless safety of flight is compromised.
4.25. Inflight Troubleshooting. After flight manual emergency procedures are complete,
aircrews will not conduct in-flight troubleshooting.
   4.25.1. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing
   and terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
4.26. Flight Control Malfunctions.
   4.26.1. The following procedures will be adhered to when maintenance "redballs" for
   primary flight control malfunctions during preflight or ground operations. The AC along with
   maintenance personnel will evaluate the malfunction and determine appropriate actions
   necessary to provide an airworthy aircraft. If the malfunction cannot be isolated to a
   particular part and repaired within a suitable amount of time, the aircraft will be returned to
   maintenance for repair.
   4.26.2. Inflight, if a primary flight control malfunction is experienced, the flight crew will
   perform the appropriate flight manual procedures, terminate the mission, and land as soon as
   practical, IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1.
4.27. Divert Charts. Units will develop divert charts to cover their local operating areas and
publish them in their local chapter to this instruction. Information contained on these charts
should include divert airfields, headings, distances, flight times, fuel requirements, and cruise
altitudes. Carry divert charts on all flights.
4.28. Air-to-Air Refueling Restrictions/Procedures.
   4.28.1. AAR Refueling procedures will be conducted IAW ATP 56 (B), Air-to-Air
   Refueling, and national annexes. Plan to AAR with a center of gravity forward of 32%
   MAC. AAR can be accomplished outside of these limits provided it is thoroughly briefed
   prior to conducting AAR.
   4.28.2. For all normal operations, the gross weight inflight with flaps up will be limited to
   the maximum gross weight versus altitude for a 2.5G load factor IAW TO 1E-3A-1, Section
   5. Use of gross weights versus altitude for a 2.0G load factor require applicable group
   commander approval.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    33


   4.28.3. Do not accomplish AAR during training missions when any conditions are
   encountered which, in the opinion of the AC or boom operator, result in marginal control of
   the aircraft or the boom.
   4.28.4. Do not accomplish AAR if any primary flight control malfunctions are encountered
   or with the series yaw damper inoperative.
   4.28.5. Do not accomplish AAR without tanker disconnect capability, to include manual
   boom latching, unless an actual fuel emergency or operational necessity exists.
   4.28.6. Boom Envelope Demonstrations will be conducted under IP/SEFE supervision. The
   boom operator will initiate and ensure disconnect capability before demonstrating limits
   IAW ATP-56(B).
   4.28.7. Non-AAR qualified FPs are authorized to fly the aircraft up to and including
   precontact from either the right or left seat with an AC in the other seat, but must not close to
   the contact postion unless under IP/SEFE supervision. AAR qualified FPs are authorized to
   fly the aircraft up to and including contact from either the left or right seat with an
   experienced AC in the other seat. Non-AAR qualified CPs are authorized to fly the aircraft
   up to and including precontact from the right seat with an AC in the left seat, but will not
   close inside precontact unless under the supervision of an IP/SEFE. AAR qualified CPs are
   authorized to fly the aircraft up to and including contact from the right seat with an
   experienced AC in the left seat. CP AAR from the left seat will be conducted under IP/SEFE
   supervision.
   4.28.8. ACs/CPs undergoing initial qualification or upgrade training may conduct a
   rendezvous up to 1 NM from the tanker without IP/SEFE supervision.
   4.28.9. To allow time to establish communications with ATC, discontinue air refueling at
   least 3 minutes prior to the end of track and descend to the bottom of the block.
   4.28.10. Loss of Radio Contact. If contact is not established or is lost between tanker and
   the E-3 on the allocated AAR frequency, follow “Loss of Radio Contact” guidance IAW
   ATP 56(B).
4.29. Post AAR Procedures. Use the following procedures after completion of air refueling to
achieve safe separation from the tanker:
   4.29.1. The receiver pilot will maintain stabilized in the contact position while asking for or
   initiating a disconnect and will remain stabilized until confirming either visually or verbally
   that the boom is clear.
   4.29.2. After confirmation that the boom is clear, the receiver pilot will begin to move aft to
   the pre-contact position. Once this separation has been attained, the receiver pilot will begin
   a slow descent at approximately 500 to 1,000 feet per minute (fpm) and establish a power
   setting that will ensure increased vertical separation and avoid under-running the tanker
   during descent.
   4.29.3. The pilot will establish a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation between the
   receiver and the tanker. Do not make any turns from the established air refueling heading
   during the descent phase.

                     MISSION CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

5.1. E-3 Missions.
   5.1.1. E-3 Tactical Mission:
      5.1.1.1. The E-3 is a primary airborne element of the Theater Air Control System
      (TACS). Specific mission taskings, to include functioning as a Control and Reporting
      Center (CRC), will be determined by the Joint Force Air Component Commander
      (JFACC). The E-3 may be responsible for:
          5.1.1.1.1. Surveillance within its assigned area of responsibility (AOR).
          5.1.1.1.2. Detecting and assessing potential threats and passing threat calls to
          affected aircraft under E-3 control or to appropriate TACS agencies
          5.1.1.1.3. Forwarding accurate and timely surveillance data to the CRC/Air
          Operations Center (AOC) and crosstell appropriate surveillance data to adjacent
          command and control facilities.
          5.1.1.1.4. Identification of traffic in areas without existing ground identification
          authority or when ground identification facilities are degraded and not capable of
          providing the identification function.
          5.1.1.1.5. Issuing of scramble orders or airborne orders in the absence of ground
          tactical air control system (GTACS) or when authority is delegated by the AOC.
          5.1.1.1.6. Commitment of defensive counterair weapons. This may be self-initiated
          or directed by a AOC/CRC.
          5.1.1.1.7. Maintaining status of available weapons and equipment.
          5.1.1.1.8. Airspace regulation and control within an assigned control area.
          5.1.1.1.9. Maintaining continuous communications with other airspace control
          agencies.
          5.1.1.1.10. Relaying information/instructions from the AOC, CRC, and other
          elements of the TACS (i.e. Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System
          [JSTARS]) to airborne aircraft.
      5.1.1.2. When the primary or alternate AOC is inoperative, the JFACC may direct an E-3
      to continue to manage tactical air operations until the AOC becomes operational. Under
      this condition, additional E-3 responsibilities may include voice coordination with Army,
      Navy, Allied units, and Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs).
   5.1.2. E-3 North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Missions. The
   NORAD strategic air defense mission covers three roles: air sovereignty, tactical warning,
   and atmospheric defense. Air sovereignty is the peacetime policing of the combined
   US/Canadian sovereign airspaces to ensure that all air traffic using the airspace complies
   with national regulations. The second role of tactical warning includes detecting,
   characterizing, and assessing potential threats. The third role is the wartime role of
 36                                                       AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


   atmospheric air defense against an enemy threat or attack. NORAD performs these roles by
   integrating a variety of sensor equipment, communications, aircraft, and facilities.
   5.1.3. E-3 Counter Narcotics Terrorism. The E-3 counterdrug (CD) mission is to assist
   national agencies in interdiction of suspected drug traffic IAW command directives.
   5.1.4. Joint Tactical Air Operations (JTAO). Integration and coordination among all C2
   units deployed to a particular theater is paramount for effective JTAO operations. JTAO
   operations are defined in the JTAO Procedural Handbook. E-3 crews must be fully trained
   to execute the Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order (ACO), and Operation
   Task Link (OPTASKLINK) in a joint environment to ensure proper force management and
   control of weapons systems. The entire system is dependent upon the effective use and
   control of data links. E-3 crews must understand their role within the joint data network and
   how their data can both aid and hamper JTAO. CJCSM 3115.01A, Joint Data Network
   Operations, outlines the duties of the Joint Information Coordination Center (JICC) and how
   the multi-link network is to be administered. E-3 crews will operate data link equipment
   IAW CJCSM 6120.01C, Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link (TDL) Operating Procedures, and
   the written guidance of the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) (i.e. OPTASKLINK,
   OPTASK ID Supp, and Tactical Operation Data (TACOPDAT)). During missions, the crew
   will adhere to the directions of the joint, regional, or sector interface control officers
   (J/R/SICO). Coordination will be performed on the assigned interface control net (ICN)/data
   link coordination net (DCN) and track supervision nets (TSN). All E-3 crewmembers
   participating on these nets must be familiar with directed net procedures and follow the
   directions of the net control station (NECOS).

      azimuth, second-time-around-thresholds, etc.), and on detection, analysis, and response to
      EA.
5.3. Operational Procedures.
   5.3.1. Aircraft Mission Systems History Log Book. Maintain a history log book for each
   aircraft. Units will develop history log book procedures and ensure log books are readily
   available. Technicians will review the log book during preflight.
   5.3.2. Equipment Malfunctions. The MCC, after coordination with the AC on equipment
   issues which affect aircraft systems, must approve continued operations of malfunctioning
   mission equipment that would affect the mission. The MCC will evaluate the impact of
   using degraded equipment against the mission tasking and the inability to meet that tasking.
   5.3.3. Air Surveillance Procedures:
      5.3.3.1. Coordination. The ASO will coordinate with the SD, ECO, and MCC to ensure
      all activity is conducted on an appropriate map. Coordinate Command and Control
      Coordinate System (CCCS) origin changes with the MCC, CDMT and ECO prior to
      taking the switch action.
      5.3.3.2. Briefings. The ASO/SST will accomplish a surveillance briefing on mission
      planning day that will cover surveillance information and contracts applicable to the
      entire mission and/or flight crew. The ASO will also accomplish a surveillance
      specialized briefing prior to assuming station. As a minimum, this briefing will include
      surveillance areas not covered in previous briefings and any areas needing extra
      emphasis, such as individual taskings, surveillance contracts, ROE, symbology and
      tracking, identification plan, and contingency/emergency duties.
      5.3.3.3. Sensor Management/Procedures. Prior to assuming station, the ASO will
      perform sensor checks to determine the optimum radar/IFF settings for the mission. The
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 43


     ASO will brief the MCC on the results of the checks and the final radar setup. Sensor
     check procedures include:
        5.3.3.3.1. IFF Sensor Check. Perform a systematic checkout of the IFF, to include all
        operational Receiver/Transmitters (R/T)s as soon as it becomes available. If
        equipment malfunctions, the ASO will accomplish an additional check once the unit
        is back on line. If a previously unchecked R/T unit comes on line, the ASO will again
        accomplish an additional check. As a minimum, the ASO will check:
            5.3.3.3.1.1. Mode IV Test. Perform a mode IV loop test prior to declaring the
            IFF operational.
            5.3.3.3.1.2. Maximum Range. Measure the maximum range of the IFF by
            determining the range of an IFF sensor return with a consistent (three out of seven
            returns) data trail.
            5.3.3.3.1.3. IFF Jitter. Check in all quadrants, as close as possible to, but not
            beyond, 250 NM from the E-3. Measure jitter as sideways displacement of
            returns from a straight-line path. Normally jitter up to 3 NM is acceptable.
            5.3.3.3.1.4. Quality. The overall quality of the IFF will be determined by
            checking consistency of data trails, and when radar becomes available, the
            mileage difference between the IFF and radar sensor returns. Normally, returns
            within 2 NM are acceptable. Accomplish this check within a radius of 250 miles
            from the E-3.
            5.3.3.3.1.5. Resolution of IFF Overloads. The ASO will monitor IFF counts and
            make necessary adjustments to resolve overload conditions and minimize the loss
            of IFF data.
        5.3.3.3.2. Radar Sensor Check. Time permitting, the ASO will check as many RF
        sets as possible, and select a primary and secondary RF set (preferably not in the
        same chain). The ASO will use identical radar tabular display settings for each RF
        set checked for accurate comparison. Radar mode will include both the Doppler and
        Beyond The Horizon (BTH) radars. A sensor quality check must be made when
        established in the orbit area if a checkout was made prior to arrival to the orbit area.
        The radar check will include:
            5.3.3.3.2.1. Doppler/BTH Maximum Range. Determine the maximum doppler
            range from the situation indicator display presentation using data trails with a
            minimum 40% blip-scan ratio (3 out of 7 scans have radar returns). A single data
            point, present or history, may be used to determine the maximum BTH range
            from the situation indicator display presentation.
            5.3.3.3.2.2. Quality. Radar quality is determined by the percentage of all IFF
            returns within a 250 NM radius of the E-3 that have consistent discernible radar
            data trails. In addition, consider the overall consistency of the radar presentation.
            Use the following criteria to assess the overall quality of the radar:
               5.3.3.3.2.2.1. Good. Greater than 50%.
               5.3.3.3.2.2.2. Fair. Between 30 to 50%.
44                                                      AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


                5.3.3.3.2.2.3. Poor. Less than 30%.
            5.3.3.3.2.3. System Counts. On applicable form, log the Doppler, BTH, and
            Mode 3 counts for comparison of radar frequencies. Time of day, operating
            location, traffic density areas, and radar mode of operation may significantly
            affect the ratio of these figures.
            5.3.3.3.2.4. Sensor Re-Check Procedures. Once the sensors have been initially
            checked and declared operational, the ASO is not required to re-accomplish a full
            sensor check unless the applicable sensor system is powered down or if the ART
            accomplishes a Fault Isolation Test (FIT) on the radar system, i.e. after Quality
            Control (QC). In circumstances such as post-AAR where sensors are transferred
            but not powered down, the ASO will, at minimum, accomplish a quality check of
            radar and IFF systems prior to declaring them operational.
        5.3.3.3.3. Radar Setup. The ASO must consider the effects of the E-3 flight
        parameters on sensor performance and attempt to optimize checkout within these
        constraints. The assessment of overall air picture quality will be the primary factor in
        determining the optimum RF set.
            5.3.3.3.3.1. After selecting the optimum RF set, the ASO will declare the radar
            operational.
            5.3.3.3.3.2. When multiple E-3 flights operate in an area, the ASO will perform
            frequency deconfliction as required.
     5.3.3.4. Data Link Procedures and Operation. Data link is the primary means of passing
     E-3 information. Establish data links according to, Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link (TDL)
     Operating Procedures, for the JTIDS Network Library for JTIDS and TADIL A during
     Continental United States (CONUS) operations. Establish data link operations outside
     the CONUS according to local theater directives and the OPTASKLINK.
     5.3.3.5. Assuming Station. ASO will inform MCC of station assumption requirements
     not yet completed:
        5.3.3.5.1. Conduct data base checks as appropriate.
        5.3.3.5.2. IFF configured for mission use.
        5.3.3.5.3. Configure the radar settings and optimize sensors for maximum detection
        while maintaining air-picture quality.
        5.3.3.5.4. Track initiation on all data trails within the assigned AOR(s).
        5.3.3.5.5. Initiate contact with ground control agencies.
        5.3.3.5.6. Operational data links(s).
        5.3.3.5.7. PDS Download. The ASO is permitted to download PDS when an ECO is
        not on-board for the purpose of internal crew PDS displays training. Only an ECO
        will declare PDS operational. (Note: Without an ECO on-board PDS will not be used
        for such purposes as signal of interest location, coordination and reporting, electronic
        identification, and threat warning.
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                45


     5.3.3.6. Voice Tell and Recording Procedures. When the E-3 is in an environment with
     units not capable of data link interface, use the following voice tell and recording
     procedures:
        5.3.3.6.1. The E-3 will voice tell priority one, two, and three tracks unless the
        receiving agency directs cease tell. Tell all other priorities on request only. For this
        purpose, the following priorities have been established:
            5.3.3.6.1.1. Priority One. Hostile/Faker.
            5.3.3.6.1.2. Priority Two. Unknown/Pending.
            5.3.3.6.1.3. Priority Three. Emergencies.
            5.3.3.6.1.4. Priority Four. Defensive Counter Air.
            5.3.3.6.1.5. Priority Five. VIP Flights.
            5.3.3.6.1.6. Priority Six. Special Missions.
            5.3.3.6.1.7. Priority Seven. Other tracks as directed by the receiving agency, (for
            example, Neutralized Fakers). Live tracks have priority over simulated tracks.
        5.3.3.6.2. Voice tell will normally be in United States Message Text Format
        (USMTF) TRKREP format. When it is impossible for the receiving agency to accept
        tell according to USMTF, use a format agreed upon by both agencies.
     5.3.3.7. Electronic Combat Procedures. The ASO will monitor/coordinate EP actions.
     Use the following procedures:
        5.3.3.7.1. The ASO, ECO and ART will coordinate on any unusual sensor activity to
        determine whether the source is external or internal and type of interface if able. If
        no explanation can be determined and the source is external, submit an Air Force
        Spectrum Interference Reporting System (AFSIRS) report.
        5.3.3.7.2. Make every effort in an EA environment to obtain active data on all EA
        targets. Whenever possible, use cooperative passive tracking. If cooperative support
        is not available, use self-passive tracking.
        5.3.3.7.3. When self-triangulating, to determine if one of several previously active
        tracking returns is a suspected EA emitter, the AST will extrapolate the suspected
        track on its last known heading, speed and altitude, before initiating a passive track.
        If two tracks are used, the ASO will coordinate with the MCC and SD to ensure
        proper weapons commitment.
        5.3.3.7.4. The ASO will keep the MCC and SD advised on status of passive tracks.
        When the ASO is confident that the passive track has correlated with the jammer‟s
        location, notify the SD that the track has “stabilized” and enable display to weapons
        consoles. In the event of burn-through, the ASO, in coordination with the MCC and
        IAW ROE, may “validate” the track as a jammer and associate the symbology with
        active data.
     5.3.3.8. Identification. When the E-3 is granted ID authority, the ASO will use all
     available capabilities and resources to ID tracks within its AOR according to the theater
46                                                    AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


     ID Matrix (Note: PDS will not be used for identification purposes without an ECO to
     declare the system operational). The MCC will retain hostile declaration authority.
  5.3.4. Weapons Procedures:
     5.3.4.1. Station Assumption. Prior to assuming station, the SD will:
        5.3.4.1.1. Contact FAA/Air Route Traffic Control Center (AFRTCC) or ground
        monitor/control authority, and complete sensor correlation check as required IAW
        LOA directives or as directed by Contact FAA/Air Route Traffic Control Center
        (AFRTCC) or ground monitor/control authority.
        5.3.4.1.2. Check all weapons assigned radio frequencies for usability.
        5.3.4.1.3. Check data base accuracy.
     5.3.4.2. On-Station Procedures. Procedures will be according to the operational
     procedures contained in this instruction and specific mission directives.
     5.3.4.3. Off-Station Procedures. The SD will compile controlled aircraft mission totals
     and furnish this data to the MCC. The SD will pass totals to the ground monitor if
     requested/directed.
     5.3.4.4. SD Control Procedures. The SD may control aircraft during a mission after
     coordination with the MCC and when simultaneous missions are not in progress.
     5.3.4.5. Handoff Procedures. Handoff procedures IAW applicable FAA Letters of
     Agreement. The SD or a designated AWO will monitor the handoff frequency at all
     times when performing station assumption duties and while on station.
     5.3.4.6. Controlled Aircraft Emergency Procedures.        For aircraft with in-flight
     emergencies, the SD/AWO performing the handoff will use the word “Emergency” at the
     beginning and ending of transmissions to the recovery agency. In the event of an
     emergency being declared by an aircraft under E-3 control, the AWO will refer to their
     Aircrew Aids, “Controlled Aircraft Emergency Procedures.”
     5.3.4.7. Control Procedures. On-station control procedures will be IAW AFI 11-214,
     IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations and Procedures
     5.3.4.8. Airspace. Use of airspace will be IAW IAW FAA JO 7610.4N, Special
     Operations and appropriate Letters of Agreement
     5.3.4.9. Distressed Aircraft. Report any suspected or triangular distress patterns to the
     SD.
     5.3.4.10. Symbology. During all operations, AWOs will ensure symbology and sensor
     data of controlled aircraft are within 2 NM of each other. Weapons pairings to Combat
     Air Patrol (CAP), air-to-air intercept, and ground targets should be accomplished as
     briefed IAW mission TDL employment.
  5.3.5. Communications Procedures:
     5.3.5.1. Radio Procedures. Adhere to communications discipline at all times. All
     crewmembers will use proper International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) phrases,
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    47


     phonetic alphabet, and R/T procedures outlined in ACP 121, US Sup 2 (Communications
     Instructions, General-Air-Ground).
     5.3.5.2. Priority of Message Transmissions. The E-3 aircrew, while in flight, will
     transmit messages according to the following priority:
         5.3.5.2.1. Flight Safety.
         5.3.5.2.2. Command and Control Information.
         5.3.5.2.3. Flight Regularity.
     5.3.5.3. Phone Patches.     Units will establish phone patch procedures in their local
     chapter.
     5.3.5.4. Call Signs. Always use the aircraft callsign when transmitting messages of
     Flight Safety, aircraft movement, and radio calls required by this instruction. Mission
     crewmembers will use the mission crew call sign when communicating with the
     respective controlling or monitoring agency, aircraft under their control, or as
     fragged/briefed. The CSO will brief crewmembers on call signs to use when providing
     alternate communications.
     5.3.5.5. UHF/VHF Guard Monitoring Procedures. The MCC will ensure the mission
     crew monitors VHF and UHF guard frequencies. The MCC, SD, ECO, and AWOs will
     have UHF guard receive/transmit programmed to their consoles. While aircraft are under
     control by the mission crew, the SD will designate at least one weapons crewmember to
     monitor UHF guard. The ASO, SST, and ASTs will have VHF guard programmed to
     their consoles. The ASO will designate at least one surveillance crewmember to monitor
     VHF guard while the E-3 is on station.
  5.3.6. Mission Crew Intercom Procedures:
     5.3.6.1. The primary means of coordination for the mission crew will be via the
     programmed mission nets.
         5.3.6.1.1. Coordinate net assignments/deviations through the MCC.
         5.3.6.1.2. Maintain strict net discipline. Limit conversation to operational matters.
     5.3.6.2. Use the ADS selective intercom system for information that is unclassified,
     lengthy in nature, and/or person-to-person conversations.
     5.3.6.3. The PA system is for use in emergencies and practice emergencies. Except for
     emergency checklist items, use of the PA by mission crew is restricted to the MCC.
  5.3.7. Special Interest Track Procedures:
     5.3.7.1. A special interest track is any track that requires priority handling by the mission
     crew.
     5.3.7.2. The E-3 will not depart orbit or working area to continue monitoring the special
     interest track unless directed by the command authority exercising E-3 Tactical Control
     (TACON). Any instructions that are directive for the E-3 (i.e., leave/move orbit, changes
     in level of decentralization, etc.) will be authenticated by the MCC/Battle Director
     Technician (BDT).
48                                                        AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


     5.3.7.3. The MCC will:
         5.3.7.3.1. Ensure the ASO assigns tracking responsibilities for the special interest
         track.
         5.3.7.3.2. Ensure the SD monitors the special interest track for possible intercept
         actions.
         5.3.7.3.3. Coordinate with the ASO and flight crew to maintain the special interest
         track within the E-3 surveillance limits (orbit location).
         5.3.7.3.4. Coordinate E-3 airspace changes (orbit location) with the flight crew, as
         required.
         5.3.7.3.5. Ensure the ECO monitors the special interest track for possible ID
         correlation.
     5.3.7.4. The ASO will:
         5.3.7.4.1. Give priority attention to the special interest track and assign it to an AST
         as a specific responsibility.
         5.3.7.4.2. Ensure the AST places the track in debriefing status, logs the time, track
         number, and ID on the appropriate forms.
     5.3.7.5. The SD will:
         5.3.7.5.1. Monitor the progress of the special interest track and conduct any tactical
         action on the track as directed.
         5.3.7.5.2. Scramble and/or direct aircraft for intercept as directed/necessary.
         5.3.7.5.3. After the accomplishment of the intercept, inform the MCC/ground
         monitor facility of any required information.
         5.3.7.5.4. Coordinate with the proper ground unit for recovery of the interceptors.
     5.3.7.6. The ECO will monitor the special interest track and make every effort to
     correlate all electronic signals eminating from the track. Log and/or hard copy, if
     available, all Augmented Report tabular displays (TDs) for emitters correlated to the
     track. If an ID can be derived from the correlated emitters this information will be passed
     to the ASO, SD, and MCC.
  5.3.8. Sensor Correlation:
     5.3.8.1. If control of aircraft is anticipated, accomplish a sensor correlation check prior to
     assuming station if required by LOA or as specified in FAA Order JO 7610.4N, Special
     Military Operations, if acting as an Military Radar Unit (MRU). If the E-3 mission is
     surveillance only, the surveillance section will perform the check with the appropriate
     automated/manual tell agency(ies).
     5.3.8.2. Perform an IFF only correlation check if:
         5.3.8.2.1. The ASO subsequently correlates IFF to radar sensor returns, or,
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 49


         5.3.8.2.2. IFF only on-station operations are authorized according to this instruction
         and theater operating instructions IAW FAA Order JO 7610.4N or ATC Letters of
         Agreement.
     5.3.8.3. Coordinate procedures with the responsible MRU prior to assuming station when
     operating as an Airborne Radar Unit (ARU).
     5.3.8.4. When operating in Canada, the E-3 will comply with the DOT/DND agreement
     (short title, “AWACS Agreement”) between Director General Air Doctrine and
     Operations Department National Defense, and Director Air Traffic Services Department
     of Transportation.
     5.3.8.5. The following procedures apply to sensor correlation checks required by
     surveillance:
         5.3.8.5.1. Minimum of two tracks within the Air Defense Identification Zone
         (ADIZ), preferably in a non-congested area.
         5.3.8.5.2. Voice tell format will include the track number, coordinates, and Mode 3
         squawk (if possible). Tracks used must be within 3 NM or less to be considered a
         good sensor correlation.
         5.3.8.5.3. Successful data link correlation checks could be used instead of voice tell
         checks due to accurate real-time data being passed between both agencies.
  5.3.9. Electronic Support Procedures.
     5.3.9.1. Coordination. The ECO will coordinate with the MCC, ASO, SD, CDMT,
     DOW, and Electronic Support Team (EST) to ensure PDS is loaded with an appropriate
     database. The ECO will also coordinate with the MCC when PDS is downloaded, and
     operational. In addition the ECO will advise the MCC, CDMT and/or ASO of any
     system degradation(s).
     5.3.9.2. Sensor Management Procedures. Prior to assuming station, the ECO will
     perform checks on PDS to ensure operational status and determine optimal sensor set-up.
     The ECO will brief the MCC on the results of these checks.
         5.3.9.2.1. PDS. At a minimum, the ECO will check:
            5.3.9.2.1.1. Reception in Frequency Range. Check to ensure 360-degree
            reception of signals within all three bands: low, medium and high. This is a
            subjective check, but there should be several indications within each band on
            different azimuths.
            5.3.9.2.1.2. Triangulation. Triangulation of a known emitter (like an ATC radar
            at a civil airport) should be conducted. Once the active emitter file reaches
            “monitor status,” check the location of the triangulated site against the location of
            the known emitter.
            5.3.9.2.1.3. Overload Management. Evaluate any reported overloads and correct
            as necessary. Overload conditions that cannot be resolved might indicate internal
            interference and should be corrected IAW established procedures.
50                                                     AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


     5.3.9.3. Data Link Procedures. The ECO should coordinate with the ASO/SST to ensure
     PDS data link filters are set correctly. The ECO will be responsible for selecting specific

Terms
Aircrew—Use this term to describe the complete complement of personnel required to fly an
operational mission. It composes both the flight crew and the mission crew.
Critical Phases of Flight—Critical phases of flight are takeoff, air to air refueling, flight below
5,000 feet AGL, approach, landing, and any other maneuver listed in this instruction requiring
IP/SEFE supervision.
 58                                                      AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012


Flight Crew—The flight crew is responsible for the safe ground and flight operations of the E-3
aircraft. It consists of an AC, FP or CP, Nav, and FE. For purposes of this instruction, Flight
Crew Training (FCT) personnel are considered flight crew members; however, contractor
personnel will not occupy primary E-3 crew positions during critical phases of flight.
Group Commander—For sorties under AFRC OPCON, the 970th Airborne Air Control
Squadron Operations and Training (O and T) officer (or designated representative) acts as the
applicable group commander.
Instructor/Standardization Evaluation Flight Examiner (SEFE) Supervision—
Instructor/SEFE supervision requires an instructor/SEFE who is qualified and current in the
position and the maneuver that will be performed. Individuals not qualified or current in the
aircraft, require instructor/SEFE supervision for the activity in which they are unqualified or
noncurrent. For unqualified or noncurrent pilots, IP/SEFE supervision requires the IP/SEFE to
be in one of the pilots‟ seats with immediate access to the controls while the maneuver is being
performed. For all other crewmembers, instructor/SEFE supervision requires over-the-shoulder
observation of the unqualified/non-current crewmember. During critical phases of flight, flight
crew instructors/SEFEs are allowed to stand, all others will be at the discretion of the PIC.
Mission Crew—The mission crew consists of those individuals responsible for the command,
control, surveillance, communications/electronic, and management functions, to include the
control and monitoring of assigned aircraft, sensor management, internal and external
communications management for mission operations, and onboard systems maintenance. It
consists of the Mission Crew Commander (MCC), Senior Director (SD), Air Weapons Officer
(AWO), Air Surveillance Officer (ASO), Electronic Combat Officer (ECO), Senior Surveillance
Technician (SST), Air Surveillance Technician(s) (AST), Computer Display Maintenance
Technician (CDMT), Airborne Radar Technician (ART), Communications Systems Operator
(CSO), and the Communications Technician (CT).
Mission End Time (MET)—-(AFRC only) The scheduled day and time a flight crew is planned
to return to home station from an exercise or deployment. The MET will be published in the
monthly Operations Plan, rotation schedule, flying schedule, and/or OPORD, as necessary. The
MET is the baseline for computing Scheduled Return Time.
Mission Essential Ground Personnel—-Individual who perform unique support duties directly
related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission being flown. The OG/CC (or
equivalent) with operational control of the aircraft being flown grants MEGP status.
NORAD Battle Staff—The battle staff assists the crew performing aerial operations within the
NORAD area of operations (AO). The battle staff is responsible for managing the air battle and
carrying out the required command and control functions. It has the responsibility and authority,
as directed by the appropriate commander, to ensure the most effective use of assigned resources
to accomplish the mission. The Battle Director Technician(s) (BDT) are ACC/PACAF E-3
crewmembers specifically trained to support the NORAD mission. Supported commanders may
also provide a NORAD Airborne Battle Commander (NABC) and NORAD Weapons Resource
Officer (NWRO). PACAF/AFRC E-3 crewmembers will be trained and certified by local
procedures using a command approved syllabus.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at
any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   59


combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command.
Operational control is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component
commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and
forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary
to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for
logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM)—The office responsible for, but not
limited to publishing flight crew orders, flight and mission crew kits, and tracking the squadron‟s
aircraft locations.
Scheduled Return Time (SRT)—-(AFRC only) A force management tool used by the on-scene
commander to assure return of the Reserve associate personnel to home station before the
expiration of their active duty orders. The SRT is calculated MET plus 24 hours.
Tactical Control (TACON)—Command authority over assigned or attached forces or
commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the
detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the operational area necessary
to accomplish missions or tasks assigned. Tactical control is inherent in operational control.
Tactical control may be delegated to, and exercised at any level at or below the level of
combatant command. Tactical control provides sufficient authority for controlling and directing
the application of force or tactical use of combat support assets within the assigned mission or
task.
Transition—Practice multiple takeoffs, simulated emergency patterns, low approaches and
touch and go landings. Transition timing begins when the aircraft crosses the threshold on the
first approach.
Wing Commander—For sorties under AFRC OPCON the 513th ACG Commander (or
designated representative) acts as the WG/CC.

                       E-3 BAGGAGE AND EQUIPMENT LOADING

A2.1. Flight Engineer Responsibilities:
   A2.1.1. Verify an AFTO Form 781A entry was made when On-Board Spare (OBS) kits are
   loaded.
   A2.1.2. Ensure the removal of the forward two metal boxes of the OBS kits after arrival at a
   TDY location, if the stay will be longer than 3 days.
   A2.1.3. Ensure only enough cleaning supplies are stored in the galley compartment to clean
   the area for one mission. Store the remaining cleaning supplies and all onboard bench stock
   in the dedicated crew chief box in the aft lower lobe.
A2.2. Loading Procedures. The following loading procedures apply to all E-3 operations. For
more specific guidelines, refer to the following T.O.s: 1E-3A-1, 1E-3A-5-1, 1E-3A-5-2, and 1E-
3A-2-7.
   A2.2.1. OBS Kits. An OBS kit consists of as many as five metal boxes and one fiberglass
   box containing an inertial navigation unit (INU). If maintenance requires OBS kits, install
   the five metal boxes in the forward lower lobe using the rail system described in T.O. 1E-3A-
   2-7. Any other method of securing the metal boxes in the forward lower lobe is not
   acceptable. Secure the INU in the “J” compartment with cargo straps. Weight of OBS kits
   vary. The actual weight is annotated on each box. The crew chief will be responsible for
   recording the weights of each box and its location with an AFTO Form 781A entry. For
   mission planning purposes, use the standard weight of 650 pounds in the forward lower lobe
   and 127 pounds in “J” compartment. Make adjustments on DD Form 365-4 as necessary.
   After arrival at a TDY location, if the stay will be longer than 3 days, remove at least the
   forward two metal OBS kit boxes from the aircraft to allow for better access to the area for
   firefighting, etc., if the location has a means of securing the kits.
   A2.2.2. Technical Orders. Carry one case of T.O.s when an OBS kit is loaded. Store in the
   “J” compartment and secure with cargo straps.
   A2.2.3. Tool Box:
       A2.2.3.1. Secure the inflight tool box carried by the CT in the “J” compartment with
       cargo straps.
       A2.2.3.2. When a crew chief tool box is required, secure it at the tiedown point in the aft
       lower lobe or in “J” compartment with cargo straps.
   A2.2.4. Crew Baggage. In order to facilitate loading, crewmembers and PAX will maximize
   the use of soft luggage (i.e., issued B-4, A-3, and hang-up bags) for exercises and
   deployments. Crewmembers should be aware that proper aircraft/loading requires strapping
   the load down tightly in order to prevent load shifting. Crewmembers are normally allowed a
   baggage limit of 25 pounds on short term TDYs (7 days or less) and 55 pounds on longer
   deployments. However, if on mission planning day, weight appears to be critical, the AC
   and FE will determine the maximum allowable baggage weight and inform crewmembers
   and passengers of how much they will be allowed to carry. Baggage will be secured at a
AFI11-2E-3V3 14 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               61


  height no higher than 40 inches in “J” compartment. Small, carry-on type baggage may be
  stacked higher that 40 inches provided they are secured at or below 40 inches.
  A2.2.5. Jackets and Garment Bags. Jackets and lightweight garment bags may be stored on
  the clothing rack next to the lavatory.
  A2.2.6. SF6. Up to four additional SF6 bottles, empty or full, may be stored in the aft lower
  lobe. Bottles will be secured in the SF6 storage racks, if the aircraft is modified. If not
  modified, use cargo straps, and up to four small bottles can be stored.
  A2.2.7. RMA Kits. Store RMA kits in the area under the DDI at seat 8.
  A2.2.8. Additional Baggage/Equipment. “J” compartment loading will be accomplished
  IAW T.O. 1E-3A-5-2.
  A2.2.9. General:
     A2.2.9.1. Mission crewmembers should store professional gear (i.e., pubs/helmet bag)
     either in “J” compartment or at their individual consoles in a manner that will minimize
     movement of gear.
     A2.2.9.2. Compartment weight limitations will be IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1.
     A2.2.9.3. Crew bunks will only be used for storing pillows and blankets which will be
     secured by seatbelts. Nothing will be stored beneath the bunks. Floor rings used to
     secure bunks to the floor will not be used for luggage/equipment tiedown.
