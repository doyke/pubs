        1.8.4. Report all suspected thermal stress illnesses to the work center supervisor.
2. Monitoring Heat Stress:
     2.1. BEF will monitor thermal stress indexes routinely during the hot weather season. The
     monitoring period will begin on 1 May and end when measurements do not exceed 82
     degrees for five consecutive work days (typically occurs in early October) but not earlier than
     30 September. Extend the monitoring period based on seasonal variations.
        2.1.1. BEF will perform heat stress monitoring at 0845, 1045, 1245, and 1445 Monday
        thru Friday, except for federal holidays. BEF will take an additional reading at 1645 if
        the 1445 reading is equal to or greater than 82 degrees. Data will be loaded onto the
        knowledge                                 exchange                               website
DMAFBI48-101 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                5


      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-SG-AC-10 for base
      wide dissemination. For any website issues, please contact the Bioenvironmental
      Engineering office for the most current thermal index.
      2.1.2. Personnel working on weekends or outside normal work hours should follow the
      time/weather pattern of the three previous weekdays.
3. Monitoring Cold Stress:
   3.1. Cold stress is generally not a problem at Davis-Monthan AFB. However, evening
   temperatures can occasionally dip low enough to present a thermal hazard during the winter
   months. BEF and Base Weather will monitor the cold stress on an as-needed basis during
   winter time. The winter monitoring period will typically begin around Thanksgiving and end
   the first of March (the monitoring period may fluctuate based on seasonal variations).
      3.1.1. When predicted or forecasted temperatures fall to 40 F or less, BEF will gather
      temperature and wind speed data at least five times per duty day from Base Weather and
      calculate the WCT index. Examples of monitoring schedules might be 0700, 0900, 1100,
      1300, and 1500 (lengthen the monitoring schedules based on changing or developing
      weather systems).
      3.1.2. Base Weather will calculate the WCT index after normal duty hours and on
      weekends as needed.
4. 355th Wing Exercises:
   4.1. BEF personnel deployed to Base X will monitor thermal stress every hour, 24 hours per
   day during base exercises.
   4.2. Personnel performing ground crew operations and training while wearing the chemical
   defense ground crew ensemble (GCE) are at increased risk of injury from heat stress. The
   BEF Emergency Operations Center (EOC) representative will make the following
   adjustments to the WBGT index based on mission oriented protective posture (MOPP)
   conditions and individual protective equipment (IPE) worn:
      4.2.1. IPE (flak jacket and helmet) only - add 5 degrees to the measured WBGT.
      4.2.2. MOPP 2 only - add 5 degrees to the measured WBGT.
      4.2.3. MOPP 2 and IPE worn - add 10 degrees to the measured WBGT.
      4.2.4. MOPP 3 or 4 only - add 10 degrees to the measured WBGT.
      4.2.5. MOPP 3 or 4 and IPE worn - add 15 degrees to the measured WBGT.
   4.3. The BEF EOC representative will report the adjusted WBGT index to the Wing Battle
   Staff, the EOC Commander, and the Unit EOC representatives when changes in
   recommended work/rest or work/warming cycles are necessary.
   4.4. Each Unit EOC representative will contact their Unit Control Center (UCC) whenever
   the WBGT changes.
      4.4.1. While deployed to Base X, personnel will adhere only to the thermal stress index
      provided by the EOC.

     4.5. The Wing Commander or Vice Wing Commander can reduce Mission-Oriented
     Protective Posture (MOPP) or suspend work based on existing thermal stress conditions. The
     355th Medical Group Battle Staff representative is available for consultation in the decision
     making process.
5. Acclimatization:
     5.1. Acclimatization is a series of physiological adjustments that occur when an individual is
     exposed to changes in climate. All personnel will experience this period of adjustment
     regardless of their physical condition. The better the individual‟s physical condition, the
     quicker they will acclimatize to their new environment. Personnel will become acclimatized
     through progressive exposures to heat and physical exertion. This process should be about
     50 percent complete by the end of the first week. Substantial acclimatization (about 78
     percent) should occur by the end of the second week. Personnel will become fully
     acclimatized by gradually increasing periods of work in the heat.
     5.2. Supervisors should adjust work schedules for personnel undergoing acclimatization (see
     paragraph 5.3).
        5.2.1. Personnel should perform the most strenuous tasks early in the morning or late in
        the evening with lighter duty tasks performed during the remainder of the duty day.
        Work schedules can be shifted back to normal routines as personnel become acclimatized
        to the new environment.
        5.2.2. Make personnel aware of the signs and symptoms of heat stress disorders and
        drink plenty of water during the time it takes to fully acclimatize.
        5.2.3. Personnel should be aware of their limitations throughout the acclimatization
        process and pace themselves accordingly by spreading the most strenuous labor
        throughout the day and taking brief in-place breaks when discomfort or heat stress
        symptoms are experienced.
        5.2.4. Personnel should be able to perform all tasks without difficulty after a period of 1
        to 2 weeks of working within a new environment.
     5.3. The following applies to personnel who need to become acclimatized:
        5.3.1. Individuals who are routinely and occupationally exposed to strenuous duties or
        heavy work need to reacclimatize each year. This may occur during regular duty or work
        as outside temperatures increase during the spring and summer.
        5.3.2. Newly assigned personnel arriving from cooler climates should follow the
        acclimatization guidelines given above.
        5.3.3. Personnel will lose their acclimatization within a few weeks unless repeatedly
        exposed to heat at regular intervals of four days or less. Personnel who have been
        deployed or have been on extended leave will require time to reacclimatize.
6. Specialist Occupations in a Hot Environment:
     6.1. The heat stress index is a tool to provide guidance to workplace supervisors in order to
     reduce heat stress injuries. The heat stress index is not designed for operations requiring
     heavy personal protective equipment such as fire fighting gear or other similarly restrictive or
     impermeable clothing.
DMAFBI48-101 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                   7


      6.1.1. When personnel wear restrictive or impermeable clothing, supervisors must add 10
      F to the WBGT index before applying the work/rest schedule guidelines of Attachment
      3.
   6.2. The heat stress index is not designed for hot indoor operations. BEF will perform
   special heat stress evaluations when requested for indoor environments where personnel are
   occupationally exposed to hot environments. Examples of such environments are steam pits
   and tunnels, confined spaces heated by radiant exposure to the sun, and boiler rooms and heat
   plants.

A1— This instruction uses the following definitions.
A1—Heat Illness: Traditionally heat illness is divided into heat exhaustion and heat stroke. In
practice, the division is difficult to define; thus, for the purpose of this instruction, the term „heat
illness‟ is all embracing and applies to an individual who becomes incapacitated as the result of a
rise in core body temperature.
A1—regulatory response mechanisms. The main hazards are hypothermia associated with a fall
in the body‟s core temperature and/or tissue damage that falls under the broad headings of
Freezing Cold Injury (FCI) and Non-Freezing Cold Injury (NFCI). For the purpose of this
instruction the term „Cold Injury‟ is all embracing and applies to an individual who becomes
incapacitated as the result of a drop in core body temperature, FCI or NFCI.
A1—Thermal Indices: These measurement indices determine the risk of thermal injury by an
assessment of the thermal stress placed upon personnel as a function of the air temperature, wind
speed, and humidity. The three thermal indices used in USAF programs are the Wet Bulb Globe
DMAFBI48-101 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                   9


Temperature (WBGT) index, the Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS), and the Wind Chill
Temperature (WCT) index.
A1—Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index: The WBGT index is a combination of
measurements that take into account dry air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant (solar)
heating. The WBGT index is measured using commercially available instruments that use the
following formulae:
A1—WBGT = 0.7Twb + 0.2Tbg + 0.1Tdb (outdoors).
A1—WBGT = 0.7Twb + 0.3Tbg (indoors or absent solar load). (Where Twb = wet bulb, Tbg =
black globe, and Tdb = dry bulb temperatures)
A1—altitude combat sorties. The index is not suitable for NBC aircrew equipment assemblies
but provides a measure of thermal strain for aircrew in hot environments. The FITS is based
upon the following formula:
A1— (F) = 0.83Twb + 0.35Tdb + 5.08
A1—Wind Chill Temperature (WCT) Index: The WCT index chart is a measure of cold stress
that accounts for wind speed, temperature, and heat loss and transfer from the human body to the
surroundings during cold and breezy or windy days.
A1—Thermal Stress: The common term used to cover both heat and cold stress.
A1—Work/Rest Cycle: A guidance schedule to ensure personnel take adequate rest breaks to
avoid heat stress disorders.
A1—Work/Warming Cycle: A guidance schedule to ensure personnel take adequate warming
breaks to avoid cold stress disorders.

A2.1. Heat Stress
   A2.1.1. Personnel working and/or training in hot environments can prevent heat injury by
   understanding the risk factors and causes, taking practical preventive measures, recognizing
   the symptoms, and knowing the appropriate first-aid treatment for common heat injuries and
   heat-related illnesses.
   A2.1.2. Individual Risk Factors for Heat Injury. There is wide variation in human tolerance
   to heat stress. Consider the following personal factors when assessing individual heat injury
   risk:
      A2.1.2.1. Obesity
      A2.1.2.2. Lack of physical fitness and/or lack of sleep
      A2.1.2.3. Recent alcohol intake
      A2.1.2.4. Concurrent mild illness e.g., diarrhea, viral illness, fever
      A2.1.2.5. Dehydration
      A2.1.2.6. Medication or illegal drugs
      A2.1.2.7. The presence of a heat rash or acute sunburn
   A2.1.3. Precautionary Measures. Apply the following general precautionary measures when
   working in a hot environment:
      A2.1.3.1. Water. Adhere to the hydration requirements for the current heat category and
      work rate. Drink small amounts of water more frequently and avoid caffeinated drinks
      like soda and coffee. Dilute sports drinks to half strength (1 part water : 1 part beverage
      or 2 parts water : 1 part beverage powder) for optimal fluid replacement.
      A2.1.3.2. Sodium Intake. Some salt is lost in perspiration. Maintain a normal diet,
      season food to taste, and don‟t skip any meals. Do not use salt tablets except under
      special operating conditions when ordered by competent medical authority.
      A2.1.3.3. Clothing. Wear loose fitting clothing, especially at the neck and wrist, to allow
      air circulation. Military wear the hot weather Battle Dress Uniform (BDU). Wear
      appropriate headgear. Cover yourself and apply a sun-blocking lotion to prevent sunburn
      when exposed to the sun‟s rays.
      A2.1.3.4. Work Schedules. Modify work schedules to perform the heaviest work in the
      coolest parts of the day. Adhere to the work/rest cycles appropriate to the current heat
      category and work rate.
      A2.1.3.5. Food. Avoid eating greasy, fatty, or heavy foods. Don‟t perform heavy work
      in the heat after eating a glucose or high carbohydrate meal.
      A2.1.3.6. Medical Treatment. Seek medical treatment for illnesses and skin problems,
      including rashes.

      A2.1.3.7. Other. Avoid the use of sweat inhibiting deodorants.
   A2.1.4. Recognizing and Treating Heat Stress Disorders. Recognition of heat illness is the
   key principle in treatment and management. In general, treat any individuals with the
   following signs or symptoms during physical activity in a hot environment or while wearing
   protective clothing as if they are suffering from heat illness:
      A2.1.4.1. Dizziness or confusion
      A2.1.4.2. Nausea or vomiting
      A2.1.4.3. Staggering
      A2.1.4.4. Blurred vision
      A2.1.4.5. Confusion, collapse or loss of consciousness
   A2.1.5. Common Heat Stress Disorders and Treatment
      A2.1.5.1. Sunburn: Unprotected exposure to sun can cause sunburn, accelerate skin
      aging, may cause drug photosensitization and depress skin immune responses. Sunburn
      also increases the risks of skin cancer. Altitude and reflective surfaces such as fresh ice,
      snow, sand, metal, concrete and wind increase the risk and severity of sunburn.
           A2.1.5.1.1. Sunburn Prevention and Treatment: Utilize appropriate clothing and
           sunscreen to prevent sunburn. Sunscreens are to protect against ultraviolet (UV) A
           and UV B and provide a minimum sun protective factor of 15. Severe sunburn
           (blistering) requires immediate medical treatment. Treat mild sunburn as follows:
              A2.1.5.1.1.1. Avoid further exposure
              A2.1.5.1.1.2. Cool soak with tap water
              A2.1.5.1.1.3. Apply emollients
              A2.1.5.1.1.4. Use Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
              A2.1.5.1.1.5. Apply topical steroids
      A2.1.5.2. The following table lists the most common heat stress disorders, symptoms,
      and first aid treatment:

A2.2. Cold Injuries
   A2.2.1. Personnel working and/or training in cold environments can prevent cold injury by
   understanding the risk factors and causes, taking practical preventive measures, recognizing
   the symptoms, and knowing the appropriate first-aid treatment for common cold injuries and
   cold-related illnesses.
   A2.2.2. Individual Risk Factors for Cold Injury. There is wide variation in human tolerance
   to cold stress. Consider the following personal and environmental factors when assessing
   individual cold injury risk:
       A2.2.2.1. Low body fat (body fat is an excellent insulator against heat loss)
       A2.2.2.2. Lack of physical fitness and/or lack of sleep
       A2.2.2.3. Recent alcohol intake (and to a lesser extent caffeinated drinks)
       A2.2.2.4. Concurrent mild illness e.g., diarrhea, viral illness, fever
DMAFBI48-101 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                   13


     A2.2.2.5. Dehydration
     A2.2.2.6. Medication or illegal drugs
     A2.2.2.7. Poor nutrition (the body uses more calories keeping warm)
     A2.2.2.8. Prolonged inactivity in a cold environment
     A2.2.2.9. Wind (for any given air temperature, wind increases the potential for body heat
     loss, skin cooling, and decreased internal body temperature)
  A2.2.3. Precautionary Measures. Apply the following general precautionary measures when
  working in a cold environment:
     A2.2.3.1. Water: A general recommendation for personnel in cold weather operations is
     to consume about four quarts of water each day if sedentary, and at least five to six quarts
     of water each day if active. Drink small amounts of water more frequently and avoid
     caffeinated drinks like soda and coffee. Dilute sports drinks to half strength (1 part water
     : 1 part beverage or 2 parts water : 1 part beverage powder) for optimal fluid replacement.
     A2.2.3.2. Food: Consume more food than normal. Caloric intake requirements will be
     25 to 50% higher during cold-weather operations than in warm or hot weather.
     A2.2.3.3. Clothing: Layering of clothing creates pockets of “dead air” space effectively
     trapping body heat. The insulating value of clothing depends on the thickness of air that
     is effectively immobilized, not on the specific insulation of the materials themselves.
     Use of wind resistant, water repellant fabrics as the outside layer and as the second layer
     will help provide maximum protection from cold temperatures. Looseness of fit and
     easily adjusted closures help in modifying the “dead air” space insulation to meet
     variable needs for work and rest. Too many layers of clothing will hinder movement and
     may prompt the wearer to discard the outside layers in order to perform the required
     tasks.
     A2.2.3.4. Work Schedules: Eliminate non-essential outdoor tasks. Where possible,
     perform tasks indoors. Adhere to the work/warming cycles appropriate to the current
     wind chill condition.
     A2.2.3.5. Shelter: Allow personnel to seek relief periodically from potentially
     dangerous cold stress situations (extreme cold; wind-chill; wet cold) by taking breaks in
     sheltered or heated areas, consuming warm beverages and hot food, and replacing wet
     clothing with dry clothing.
     A2.2.3.6. Other: Keep feet, hands, and exposed skin dry. Feet are particularly
     vulnerable. Whenever possible, change socks when they become wet and dust feet with
     anti-fungal powder. Avoid contact with freezing metal materials.
  A2.2.4. Recognizing and Treating Cold Stress Disorders. Recognition of cold illness is the
  key principle in treatment and management. In general, treat any individuals with the
  following signs or symptoms during physical activity in a cold environment as if they are
  suffering from a cold stress disorder:
     A2.2.4.1. Profound shivering
     A2.2.4.2. Slurred speech

     A2.2.4.3. Reduced manual dexterity
     A2.2.4.4. Aggressive or withdrawn behavior
     A2.2.4.5. Confusion, collapse or loss of consciousness
  A2.2.5. Common Cold Injuries and Treatment
     A2.2.5.1. Cold Injuries: Cold injuries are generally categorized as either nonfreezing
     cold injuries (NFCI) or freezing cold injuries (FCI). Common nonfreezing cold injuries
     can occur when conditions are cold and wet (air temperatures between 32ºF and 55ºF)
     and the hands and feet cannot be kept warm and dry. The most prominent nonfreezing
     cold injuries are chilblain and trench foot. Another non-freezing injury, hypothermia, is a
     life-threatening condition in which the deep body (core) temperature falls below 95ºF.
     The lower the core temperature, the more severe the hypothermia. When the core
     temperature reaches approximately 68ºF (20ºC) cardiac standstill occurs and the
     individual has a limited potential for recovery.
     A2.2.5.2. The following table on the following lists the most common cold injuries,
     symptoms, and first aid treatment:
