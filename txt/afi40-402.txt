                                                 SCOPE

1.1. Description. In 1991, the DoD, along with 16 federal agencies, adopted regulations that are known
collectively as the Common Federal Rule. Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 219, “Protection of
Human Subjects" applies to all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Department of Health
and Human Services’ corollary is Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Subpart A. These regu-
lations embody the ethical principles of the Belmont Report and the World Medical Association Declara-
tion of Helsinki. This instruction supplements 32 CFR 219 and the Food and Drug Administration's
(FDA) complimentary regulations, 21 CFR 50 and 56, and is intended to describe laws, regulations, poli-
cies and practices that are unique to research conducted or supported by the U.S. Air Force (USAF). This
instruction applies to all human subject research conducted or supported by the Air Force. It applies to
research that includes human subjects, whether as the direct object of research or as the indirect object of
research in the development and testing of military weapon systems, vehicles, aircraft, and other material.
It applies to research activities funded by non-Air Force resources in which the human subjects are Air
Force military or civilian personnel. It also applies to Air Force funded studies and non-Air Force funded
studies at U.S. military installations.

1.2. Research. Research, as defined in this instruction, does not include individual or group training of
military personnel such as combat readiness, effectiveness, proficiency, or fitness exercises.

     2.6.11. Appoints an independent medical monitor by name when the IRB determines the research to
     be greater than minimal risk. The IRB is responsible for determining the extent of active involvement
     required of the medical monitor. This determination will be based upon the severity of potentially
     adverse events and the probability that such events may occur. Ensures the Medical Monitor is iden-
     tified in the consent document.
     2.6.12. Appoints at least annually, an individual(s) to randomly select and spot-check active research
     study records and consent processes. For Example: this review may include a review of subject eligi-
     bility, compliance with the IRB approved protocol, and observation of the consent process. Reports of

   or Device. Consistent with 10 U.S.C. 980, under no circumstances can waiver of documentation of
   informed consent be granted (21 CFR 50.24. does apply to emergency research conducted in the
   USAF).
       2.7.12.1. The PI must submit a formal request for approval (Attachment 6) to the MTF com-
       mander, describing the life-threatening situation and why the absence of standard acceptable treat-
       ment is not adequate or appropriate. When possible, obtain the approval prior to using the drug or
       device. The PI must submit this approval and the request for emergency use to the IRB within 5
       workdays of the decision to use the drug. The IRB reviews whether the emergency use is appro-
       priate, makes recommendations as needed to MTF personnel, and sends the request for emergency
       use, with the MTF commander’s approval and the IRB recommendations, to AFMOA/SGOT.
   2.7.13. Submits protocols involving exposure of subjects to ionizing radiation, radiopharmaceuticals,

     2.8.4. Interviews and consults on individual cases and reports to the IRB/PI any discrepancies or
     problems.
     2.8.5. May stop a research study in progress, remove individual subjects from a study, or take what-
     ever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well being of research subjects.
     2.8.6. For Cooperative Oncology Group studies, a medical monitor is not needed if a data safety
     monitoring board is overseeing the study. For FDA regulated studies the sponsor appointed monitor
     may satisfy this requirement.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                    13


                                               Chapter 3

                           RESEARCH IN AIR FORCE INSTITUTIONS

3.1. Assurances. All human research conducted or supported by the Air Force shall be conducted under
an Assurance of compliance acceptable to the Air Force, unless the research is exempt from these regula-
tions under 32 CFR 219.101(b). See 32 CFR 219.103(a). A DoD Assurance is required for research per-
formed at DoD facilities and funded by the DoD. A DoD Assurance issued by the Air Force is required for
research conducted by the Air Force at an Air Force facility. Any changes to an Assurance covering
research conducted or supported by the Air Force must be prospectively approved by AFMSA/SGRC.
   3.1.1. DoD Assurances issued by the Air Force. Applications for DoD Assurances issued by the Air
   Force must be reviewed and approved by AFMSA/SGRC prior to initiation of any human research.
   Completed applications must be forwarded to AFMSA/SGRC with policies and procedures for local
   IRB operation, including those governing continuing review of the research. All IRBs designated in
   DoD Assurances issued by the Air Force must be registered with AFMSA/SGRC along with an IRB
   membership roster. AFMSA/SGRC shall issue every Assurance a tracking number. The Air Force
   issues two types of Assurances: the Multiple Project Assurance (MPA) and the Single Project Assur-
   ance (SPA).
       3.1.1.1. DELETED.
   3.1.2. SPA
       3.1.2.1. An SPA applies to only one project. Documentation of IRB review and approval of the
       covered study must be submitted to AFMSA/SGR along with the SPA application. SPAs are
       awarded for up to three years, subject to continuing review. A SPA institution that has demon-
       strated compliance with Assurance requirements may submit application for a MPA.
       3.1.2.2. SPA for an Institution Utilizing Another Air Force Institution’s IRB. When an institution
       such as a small clinic does not have an IRB, before conducting human research supported or con-
       ducted by the Air Force, it must obtain both a valid DoD Assurance issued by the Air Force and
       review and approval from a regional Air Force IRB.
       3.1.2.3. International Assurance. All research taking place outside of the U.S. and conducted or
       supported by the Air Force must be conducted under an International Assurance acceptable to
       AFMSA/SGRC as per paragraph 3.1.4.1. Research conducted at Air Force facilities outside of the
       U.S. must be conducted under a DoD International SPA issued by the Air Force through AFMSA/
       AGRC. Due to legal, ethical, and cultural differences between the U.S. and the foreign country in
       which the research will take place, IRBs, AFMSA/SGRC, and investigators are instructed to take
       extra care in reviewing, approving, and conducting international research to ensure compliance
       with the spirit of ethical guidelines for the protection of human research subjects, as well as the
       letter of the law. See paragraph 3.2.5. of this instruction for additional information on conducting
       research outside of the U.S.
   3.1.3. MPA. An MPA can apply to one or more human research projects.
       3.1.3.1. Submit requests for an MPA to AFMSA/SGRC. Requests must include a statement of
       principles and policies, documentation of IRB review and local policies for IRB operation.
14                                                                                  AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


     3.1.4. Non-Air Force Assurances. In most cases, a DoD Assurance will be required. However, in
     some cases, AFMSA/SGRC may accept an Assurance issued by DHHS. Whenever the Air Force
     accepts an Assurance not issued by the Air Force, the institution must provide a separate written
     assurance that it will comply with requirements unique to the Air Force, including this instruction and
     all attachments, and that it will report to the Air Force continuing compliance and safety issues, such
     as continuing reviews, adverse events, and protocol deviations, in accordance with this instruction.
        3.1.4.1. Copies of all non-Air Force Assurances submitted by Air Force institutions must be pro-
        vided to AFMSA/SGRC in order to ensure proper coordination with the Assurance-granting
        agency and compliance with the requirements outlined in this instruction.
        3.1.4.2. Federalwide Assurance (FWA). DHHS issues FWAs for research funded by DHHS. Insti-
        tutions participating in NCI Clinical Trials Cooperative Group projects are required to obtain an
        FWA from DHHS because NCI is an institute within DHHS. Air Force Institutions needing a
        DHHS FWA should not check the box on the FWA electing to apply the FWA to all of its human
        research.
        3.1.4.3. Cooperative Project Assurance (CPA). A CPA is an Assurance previously issued by
        DHHS for facilities involved in NCI’s Clinical Trials Cooperative Group studies.

3.2. Requirements for Special Categories of Human Subjects. The use of human subjects in research
in which there is an intervention or interaction with subjects is limited to persons who are fully informed
and who voluntarily agree to participate in the study. If the subject is legally incompetent to give consent
(as with infirmed, minors, or patients in an unconscious state) and the proposed measures are intended to
benefit the subject, then consent may be obtained from a legal guardian on the subject's behalf. Research
supported or conducted by the Department of Defense that affects the following vulnerable populations
shall meet the additional protections of 45 CFR 46, Subparts B-D: fetuses, pregnant women, or human in
vitro fertilization (Subpart B); prisoners (Subpart C); and minors (Subpart D).
     3.2.1. Active Duty Personnel as Human Subjects. The investigator, in consultation with the subject,
     should determine whether participation in a study would affect the ability of the subject to mobilize
     for readiness, to perform duties, or to be available for duty. Normally, if their participation could affect
     their performance, they should not be considered as a subject.
        3.2.1.1. Active duty personnel may receive financial compensation for participation as a subject
        of research, as long as DoD funds are not used for payment and off duty employment is autho-
        rized. (Reference 24 U.S.C. 30)
     3.2.2. Minors as Research Subjects. Minors may be used as subjects only when the protocol is
     intended to be of benefit to the subject and satisfies one of the categories in 3.5.1. or 3.5.2. of this
     instruction. In both cases, the investigator must solicit the assent of the minor according to paragraph
     3.5.3., as well as the consent of one or both parents or guardian.
        3.2.2.1. The investigation may present greater than minimal risk to minor subjects if the proposed
        procedures present a prospect of direct benefit to the individual subject, and if the IRB finds that:
            3.2.2.1.1. The risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the subject.
            3.2.2.1.2. The relationship of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the
            subjects as that presented by available alternative approaches.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                   15


     3.2.2.2. In some cases, minor subjects may be mature enough to understand the nature and conse-
     quences of their participation, or nonparticipation, in the study. The IRB must ensure that in these
     cases the investigators solicit the minor's consent, as well as the parent or guardian's, before per-
     forming a medical procedure. The investigator should assess the age, maturity, psychological
     state, and mental capacity of the minor subjects potentially involved in a study to determine if
     their consent has legal merit. Consult the legal advisor where a minor subject's capability to assent
     is in question.
  3.2.3. Mentally Disabled Persons as Human Subjects:
     3.2.3.1. A mentally disabled or institutionalized mentally infirm person may not participate as a
     test subject, unless the study would be impossible or meaningless if such subjects were excluded.
     The investigator may not use any such person as a test subject purely for the sake of convenience.
     3.2.3.2. A mentally disabled or institutionalized mentally infirm person may not participate as a
     test subject unless:
         3.2.3.2.1. The subject has given legally effective consent, or the subject's legal guardian has
         given effective third part consent, according to local law.
         3.2.3.2.2. The proposed study is concerned with one or more of the following:
         3.2.3.2.3. The diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or etiology of a particular impairment that
         inflicts the subject.
     3.2.3.3. Any other condition from which the subject is suffering, provided there is a direct poten-
     tial benefit to the subject, and prior testing has proved the risk to be acceptable.
     3.2.3.4. The effect of institutional life on the institutionalized mentally infirm subject, and
     involves no appreciable risk to the subject.
     3.2.3.5. Information which cannot be obtained from any other class of subjects.
     3.2.3.6. If the mentally disabled or institutionalized mentally infirm person appears to have suffi-
     cient mental capability to comprehend what is proposed and is able to express his or her willing-
     ness to participate, the investigator should obtain consent.
  3.2.4. Prisoners as Human Subjects. A prisoner may not participate as a human subject unless the
  proposed protocol is concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or etiology of a particular
  impairment that afflicts the prisoner and unless the prisoner may derive a direct potential benefit.
     3.2.4.1. Prisoners of War. The use of prisoners of war as research subjects is unequivocally pro-
     hibited. See DoD Directive 3216.2, paragraph 4.4.2.
  3.2.5. Non-US Citizens as Human Subjects. In protocols conducted outside the United States involv-
  ing non-US citizens as human subjects, the laws, customs, and practices of the country in which the
  study is conducted, or those required by this instruction, whichever are more stringent, shall take pre-
  cedence. The study shall meet the same standards of ethics and safety that apply to studies conducted
  within the United States, involving US citizens.
  3.2.6. Protocols Involving Biological or Chemical Warfare Agents. Research involving the use of
  human subjects for testing of chemical or biological warfare agents or nuclear weapons effects is gen-
  erally prohibited. See DoDD 3216.2, paragraph 4.4.5., and 50 USC 1520a. Such research must be
  submitted to OUSDAT for approval prior to implementation.
16                                                                                AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


3.3. Compensation for Human Subject Participation.
     3.3.1. Active duty personnel may receive financial compensation for participation as a subject of
     research, as long as DoD funds are not used for payment and off duty employment is authorized.
     (Reference 24 U.S.C. 30)
     3.3.2. In accordance with DoDD 6000.8, retired military personnel, dependents, and others not active
     duty that participate as subjects may be compensated when appropriate. When retired military per-
     sonnel, dependents, and others not on active duty participate without compensation, records must doc-
     ument the subject’s acknowledgement and agreement to participate without compensation for serving
     as subjects. Due to the possibility of injuries arising from participation in research greater than mini-
     mal risk research projects shall include an arrangement for treatment of any related injuries. Such
     arrangement may be that all subjects are eligible DoD healthcare beneficiaries, that are granted Secre-
     tarial Designation as DoD healthcare beneficiaries under applicable service regulations, or that spe-
     cific obligations for such treatment have otherwise been undertaken. In no case shall any research
     request permit volunteers to sign a statement that purports to limit any right of a subject to compensa-
     tion for possible injuries arising from participation in the research.
     3.3.3. Retired military personnel, dependents, and others routinely entitled to medical care in military
     medical treatment facilities may participate as human subjects. Such persons may receive compensa-
     tion for these services as authorized by applicable directives (B-158690, 45 Comptroller General 649,
     April 26, 1966).
     3.3.4. Private citizens. U.S. Policy is to not accept voluntary services without compensation when
     such services may provide a basis for a future claim against the government. Individuals may enter
     into an independent contractor relationship with the Air Force and participate for compensation as
     authorized by applicable directives (45 Comptroller General 649).

3.4. Survey Research.
     3.4.1. The investigator must contact the local IRB prior to initiating a research activity involving sur-
     vey instruments or methods. The IRB will determine if the research (1) is exempt from further review
     or (2) the study presents minimal risk and is eligible for expedited review; or if (3) the study requires
     full board review. Exemption and expedited review categories are listed in 32 CFR 219. If a local
     IRB does not exist or if the survey will be used at multiple sites, then a regional IRB or AFMOA/
     SGOT may determine if the research is exempt.
     3.4.2. Surveys which collect data through intervention or interaction with the subject or surveys
     which contain identifiable private information are not exempt and require IRB approval and informed
     consent.
     3.4.3. Attitude and opinion surveys must be conducted IAW AFI 36-2601, Air Force Personnel Sur-
     vey Program, February 1, 1996. Surveys within the Air Force at more than one base are to be
     approved by HQ AFPC/DPSAS, Randolph AFB, TX, IAW the Paperwork Reduction Act. Title 44,
     United States Code, Chapter 35. Any non-exempt urvey conducted outside of the Air Force requires
     Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval IAW Chapter 35 of Public Law 96-551, Paper-
     work Reduction Act. For more information on surveys, see AFI 37-124, The Information Collections
     and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Informa-
     tion Collections, Mar 29, 1994.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                      17


3.5. Informed Consent Requirements.
   3.5.1. Federal Statutory Limitations. 10 U.S.C. 980, limits the use of subjects in DoD or DoD-sup-
   ported research to persons who are fully informed and who voluntarily agree to participate in the
   study. If the subject is legally incompetent to give consent (as with infirmed, minors, or subjects in an
   unconscious state) and the proposed measures are intended to benefit the subject, then consent may be
   obtained from a legal guardian on the subject’s behalf.
   3.5.2. When a consent form is required, the subject must sign the consent form in the presence of at
   least one witness, who attests to the subject’s consent and attests to the subject’s signature by signing
   in the place provided. (Attachment 4). Assent of a minor must be obtained when appropriate.
   3.5.3. A written legal review of the Informed Consent Document must be obtained (Attachment 10)
   prior to IRB approval.
   3.5.4. Retain copies of the IRB approved consent documents and legal review in the protocol records.
   Provide a copy of the consent document to the subject.

3.6. SG Approval of Research Protocols.
   3.6.1. The SGROC must review and approve all greater than minimal risk protocols prior to initiation
   except as noted in 3.6.2. below. Protocols that are determined by the IRB to be no more than minimal
   risk to the subject must be sent to AFMSA/SGRC, which shall conduct audits in order to ensure com-
   pliance. Minimal risk studies may begin upon local IRB and Commander/AIO approval. Protocols
   that are determined to be exempt by the IRB Chair or designee must be evaluated using written crite-
   ria, reported to AFMSA/SGRC, and documented in the IRB minutes and in section 8 of the OF 310.
   The exemption must be referenced using the appropriate CFR rule. The OF 310 must be kept on file
   for audit purposes. If the SGROC disagrees with the IRB’s determination, the research study may be
   temporarily suspended until resolution. Guidance for document submission to the SGROC is included
   in this instruction (Attachment 7).
   3.6.2. The investigator may enroll subjects into local IRB and MTF/CC approved cooperative oncol-
   ogy studies prior to submitting the protocols to AFMOA/SGOT and the SGROC.
   3.6.3. Oversight of oncology protocols by AFMOA/ SGOT ends after the protocol is closed to new
   subject registration and all local subjects have completed treatment. Due to National Oncology study
   requirements local facilities may be required to keep these protocols open at their sites until subject
   follow-up is complete.
   3.6.4. Emergency use protocols must be sent to AFMOA/SGOT with the MTF commander’s
   approval and the IRB recommendations.

3.7. Classified Research Protocols.
   3.7.1. IAW 32 CFR 219 section 125, the requirements for review and approval of classified human
   research studies add further protections as follows:
       3.7.1.1. Classified research protocols must have full IRB review, and at least one non-governmen-
       tal voting member with appropriate security clearance in attendance.
       3.7.1.2. Investigators must inform the subjects that the research is classified, give a clear explana-
       tion of what classified means, and give sufficient information including classified information to
18                                                                                 AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


        allow the subject enough information to give meaningful informed consent. The requirement for
        informed consent must not be waived and the investigator must obtain signed consent. The sub-
        ject will also be informed of the identity of the sponsoring institution. In cases of dispute, the IRB
        shall determine whether potential subjects need access to additional classified information in order
        for the subject to make a valid assessment of the risks and benefits of participation in the study.
        3.7.1.3. Classified Research Protocols must be recommended for approval by the majority vote of
        the IRB and approved by the institutional official before being forwarded through AFMOA/SGOT
        to the Secretary of Defense for final approval.
        3.7.1.4. Any IRB member who does not believe a specific classified project should be approved
        may appeal the IRB recommendation to the Secretary of Defense within 20 days after the IRB
        meeting. All appeals will be forwarded to the Office of the Air Force Surgeon General through
        AFMOA/SGOT.

3.8. Adverse Events.
     3.8.1. Adverse events must be reported to the IRB in accordance with local IRB policy. Serious,
     expected or unexpected adverse events must also be forwarded to the MTF Commander or AIO. Seri-
     ous, unexpected and related adverse events must be sent to AFMOA/SGOT as soon as possible, but
     within 15 working days of being notified of the adverse event. The IRB will review the incident to
     evaluate the effect of the adverse event on the risks of harm to other research subjects and determine
     if a change in procedures/consent document is warranted. The PI will report the AE using the FDA
     MedWatch Form 3500 or equivalent (Attachment 5) and submit the form to the IRB for review of the
     incident.

3.9. Scientific Misconduct.
     3.9.1. Air Force institutions must ensure that research is conducted under the highest ethical
     standards. In support of this responsibility, every allegation of research misconduct shall be investi-
     gated. All allegations of research misconduct shall be investigated in an independent, unbiased, and
     equitable manner that minimizes disruption to research in process unless the research misconduct
     could result in a threat to public health or safety . Written institutional policy governing research mis-
     conduct must be established in accordance with the requirements of DoDI 3210.7 and submitted to
     AFMSA/SGRC.
        3.9.1.1. Seriousness of the misconduct. The commander should determine if the misconduct was
        intentional or reckless; was an isolated event or part of a pattern; had significant impact on the
        research record; or had significant impact on other researchers or institutions.
        3.9.1.2. Administrative Actions, including but not limited to, letters of reprimand; the imposition
        of special certification or assurance requirements to ensure compliance with applicable regula-
        tions or terms of an award; suspension or termination of an active award; or suspension and debar-
        ment in accordance with the government-wide rule on non-procurement suspension and
        debarment, Subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, current edition. In the event of dis-
        barment or suspension, the information will be made publicly available through the List of Parties
        Excluded from Federal Procurement and Non-procurement Programs maintained by the U.S. Gen-
        eral Services Administration.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                    19


     3.9.1.3. All allegations of research misconduct occurring within an institution shall be referred to
     and investigated by the AIO; however, SGR may investigate the allegation if there is a determina-
     tion that 1) the institution is unable to conduct a thorough and unbiased inquiry and/or investiga-
     tion; 2) it is in the public interest for the parent command to conduct the inquiry and investigation;
     or 3) the allegation involves a small institution or an individual that cannot reasonably be expected
     to respond. SGR shall investigate allegations of research misconduct occurring outside of an Air
     Force institution.

                     RESEARCH IN AIR FORCE SUPPORTED INSTITUTIONS

4.1. Contractor Studies. This section sets out procedures for contracted research involving the use of
human subjects. An organization may not award a contract for research involving the use of human sub-
jects until the requirements of this instruction have been fully met.
     4.1.1. Commanders/ AIOs who approve contracts using human subjects must comply with the proce-
     dures in this instruction.
     4.1.2. Each RDT&E organization must manage its contracts to ensure contractor compliance with 32
     CFR 219 and this instruction.
        4.1.2.1. The Air Force will not award any contract that involves the use of a human subject unless
        an IRB has reviewed and approved the proposed protocol. If the proposing institution does not
        have an IRB, they may either establish one or request the services of an Air Force IRB or
        AFMOA/SGOT.
     4.1.3. An Air Force IRB or AFMOA/SGOT must approve all contractor protocols involving more
     than minimal risk and all classified protocols.
     4.1.4. The Air Force will not award a contract involving a human subject to an individual unless he or
     she is affiliated with or sponsored by an organization that can, and does, assume responsibility for that
     subject.
     4.1.5. Any organization applying for a contract to conduct research involving a human subject must
     provide a written assurance that it will abide by the policy for protection of human subjects as stated
     in this instruction. Written assurance may be provided to the sponsoring Air Force institution using
     Optional Form (OF) 310. If the organization currently has an approved multiple-project assurance on
     file with the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), as described in 32 CFR 219.103(a),
     the organization must annotate this on OF 310.
     4.1.6. The contractor must ensure it has obtained all necessary clearances and permits and has prop-
     erly coordinated with other agencies, whether federal, state, or local.
     4.1.7. Contractors must notify the US Air Force contracting agency and obtain IRB approval of any
     changes to the protocol prior to implementation. Contractors must have written procedures for notify-
     ing the US Air Force contracting agency of any misadventure or unanticipated adverse medical event
     that coincides with or possibly results from using human subjects in a US Air Force-sponsored
     research protocol. Include all the information required in paragraph 2.7. of this instruction.
        4.1.7.1. The contracting agency must notify AFMOA/SGOT of all reported contractor unantici-
        pated deviations from the approved protocol and reports of serious unanticipated adverse events.
     4.1.8. For protocols involving more than minimal risk, the contractor will submit to the sponsoring
     Air Force organization a copy of contractor records documenting protocol review, approval, conduct,
     subject consent, and results.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                    21


4.2. Collaborative Investigations with Non-Air Force Organizations.
   4.2.1. Collaborative studies with non-Air Force federal agencies or civilian organizations that involve
   subjects at Air Force facilities must comply with this instruction.
   4.2.2. Air Force personnel may act as investigators in studies conducted outside of Air Force facilities
   only if the commander/AIO decides it is in the best interest of the Air Force. If such studies involve
   human subjects, the sponsoring facility’s IRB must review and approve the study according to Federal
   law and regulations.
   4.2.3. Non-Air Force investigators wishing to use subjects at Air Force installations must adhere to
   the requirements outlined in this instruction.
   4.2.4. In order to conduct research on an Air Force installation, the investigator must obtain written
   permission from the wing/base or hospital commander in accordance with local policy.
   4.2.5. Collaborative studies with non-Air Force federal agencies or civilian organizations that use
   SGROC funds must comply with this instruction. Such studies must have an Air Force principal
   investigator or associate investigator when funded by the SGROC. The protocol must be reviewed by
   a military IRB, approved by the facility commander/AIO and reviewed by the SGROC as appropriate.
22                                                                               AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005

                                     BUDGETING AND FUNDING

5.1. AFMOA/SGOT.
     5.1.1. Follows DoDD 6000.8 policy for the funding and administration of military Clinical Investiga-
     tion Programs (CIP’s) in medical treatment facilities, dental treatment facilities and the Uniformed
     Services University of the Health Sciences. DoDD 6000.8 defines policy concerning study grants,
     cooperative agreements, cooperative research and development agreements, receipt of gifts, clinical
     investigation study subjects, and the prohibition of obligating or expending CIP funds for any external
     medical research project unless the study has been approved after an external peer review process.
     5.1.2. Provides funds to support approved research protocols that have unique supply, equipment, or
     service requirements. Funds will not be used to hire additional personnel, to pay for reprints, or for
     temporary duty travel unless explicitly approved by AFMOA/SGOT.
     5.1.3. Approves waivers for required technical support to conduct a study. The investigator must jus-
     tify the need for such services.
     5.1.4. Maintains final disposition authority for all unexpended funds.
     5.1.5. Requires notification when SG funded protocols are submitted for publication.

5.2. Reporting.
     5.2.1. Organizations awarded MPA's by AFMOA/SGOT will provide AFMOA/SGOT an accounting
     report using the quarterly reporting format provided by SGROC. RCS: HAFMOA-SG(Q)0004.
     5.2.2. Principal investigators of study projects awarded Healthy Communities Research Program
     funding will provide a technical and accounting report to AFMOA/SGOT annually.

                                               Chapter 6

                                           GIFTS/GRANTS

6.1. Gifts to the Air Force.
   6.1.1. Commanders of Air Force medical treatment facilities may accept gifts of a value not greater
   than $50,000 that require only a small expenditure to accept and maintain. Reference AFI 51-601,
   Gifts to the Air Force.
   6.1.2. Only the Secretary of the Air Force may accept a gift offer with a value over $50,000. Send the
   signed letter from the donor offering the gift and the protocol through an Air Force IRB and the local
   commander to AFMOA/SGOT.
   6.1.3. Federal law allows gifts to be accepted for use with MTF operations. To avoid the appearance
   of impropriety or violation of law, all gifts and benefits, offered in connection with research protocols
   must be fully disclosed and accepted according to AFI 51-601. Travel benefits may be accepted under
   the authority of Title 31, United States Code, Section 1353, when offered from a non-Federal source in
   connection with attendance on an official capacity at meetings or similar functions. Procedures for
   accepting travel benefits are found in Chapter 4 of the Standards of Conduct, DoD 5500.7-R, rather
   than AFI 51-601.
   6.1.4. Gifts accepted in connection with the conduct of a particular Air Force protocol, may be
   delayed or terminated if necessary in the interest of meeting Air Force mission requirements.
   6.1.5. The Air Force policy prohibits soliciting gifts, but does not prohibit researchers from applying
   for standard grants. However, the terms of any such grant applications must be consistent with the pol-
   icies of AFI 51-601.
   6.1.6. Gifts may be rejected under circumstances described in AFI 51-601.
   6.1.7. If the donor is a defense contractor or subcontractor, the donor must state that the cost of the
   gift will not be charged either directly or indirectly, as an element of cost in any US Government con-
   tract.
   6.1.8. The officer in charge of the MTF CI facility, or other officer designated by the commander will
   administer gifts received in connection with Air Force research protocols. Prospective donors should
   contact this officer for guidance on proper procedures for making gift offers. To avoid an actual or
   apparent conflict of interest, principal or associate investigators, or others directly involved in a
   research protocol, must not directly accept or administer gift funds accepted from the donor for use in
   connection with the clinical investigation.

6.2. Gift Procedures.
   6.2.1. The donor or legal guardian must sign gift offers. All gift offers with a value over $50,000
   must be forwarded through the local commander to AFMOA/SGOT for submission to the Secretary
   of the Air Force.
   6.2.2. Once the gift is accepted, the MTF/CC must ensure that proper actions are taken to receive and
   establish accounting for the gift according to the procedures in AFI 51-601.
24                                                                                AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


     6.2.3. Donors may give a wide variety of administrative, technical, or professional services to the Air
     Force as “Gifts of Service,” in support of a protocol or program and at no cost to the government.
     6.2.4. The Office of the General Counsel has determined that the gift statute (10 U.S.C. 2601) and
     AFI 51-601 do not cover services, as provided by civilian employees or agents of nonfederal organi-
     zations, such as national cancer study groups.
        6.2.4.1. 6.2.4.1.When an offer of a gift of services in support of a research protocol is made, doc-
        ument the offer and terms of acceptance in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), using the
        example at Attachment 9. The legal office servicing the MTF must review the MOU, prior to sig-
        nature by the MTF commander and the donor, and prior to the donor’s providing any technical ser-
        vices.
        6.2.4.2. .The MTF must ensure that the donor has adequate liability insurance coverage for such
        personnel (Federal Acquisition Regulation 84-42, subpart 37.4; Non-Personal Health Care Ser-
        vices), and ensure compliance with existing Air Force policies relating to licensure, credentials
        review, and clinical privileges delineation as required by AFI 44-119, Medical Service Clinical
        Quality Management, Oct 1, 1995.
     6.2.5. To avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest or violation of supplemental income rules, Air
     Force medical personnel assigned to or employed at the MTF and conducting the research protocol
     under this instruction may not engage in off-duty employment, or otherwise be compensated by
     non-Air Force sources, in connection with their work on such clinical investigations.

6.3. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants.
     6.3.1. Application Procedures: Investigators may apply for NIH grants. NIH grants may require
     Office of the Secretary of the Air Force approval before submittal. Send application, along with the
     locally approved investigative protocol, including attachments, to AFMOA/SGOT for coordination.
     AFMOA/SGOT sends the protocol and application to the Secretary of the Air Force for approval.
     6.3.2. Types of NIH Funding.
        6.3.2.1. Direct Funding. If funds are awarded, establish specific accounting criteria for audit trails
        at the local institution.
        6.3.2.2. Indirect Funding. Air Force institutions that have collaborative arrangements with other
        institutions such as national cancer groups or medical and dental schools, may receive the benefits
        of NIH funds awarded to the parent institution. In those cases where the parent institution receives
        and controls funds, the Air Force facility participating in the study may receive support. This indi-
        rect funding mechanism does not require Office of the Secretary of the Air Force approval, as pre-
        scribed above, since NIH funding to the parent institution is not directly under Air Force
        management.

Terms
Adverse Event--Any untoward medical occurrence in a research or clinical investigations subject that is
temporally related to the subject’s participation in a research protocol. An adverse event can be an unfa-
vorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease. Adverse
events may be further defined as either “serious” or ‘unexpected”.
Serious Adverse Event--Any untoward medical occurrence that results in
   a) Death – report all deaths (except National Cooperative Oncology studies, report fatal toxicity's.)
   b) Life-threatening adverse experience – report if the patient was at substantial risk of dying at the
time of the adverse event or it is suspected that continued involvement in the research protocol (e.g., that
the use or continued use of product under investigation would result in the patient’s death.) Examples:
pacemaker failure; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; bone marrow suppression; infusion pump failure (except
National Cancer Institute studies: report life threatening tonicities)
   c) Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization – report if admission to the
hospital or prolongation of a hospital stay results because of an adverse event. Examples: anaphylaxis;
bleeding causing or prolonging hospitalization.)
  d) Persistent or significant disability/incapacity – report if the adverse event resulted in a significant,
persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient’s body function/struc-
ture, physical activities or quality of life. Examples: CVA due to drug-induced hypercoagulability; toxic-
ity; peripheral neuropathy.
                                                     or
  e) Congenital anomaly/birth defect – report if there are suspicions that exposure during the course of
a research study (e.g., investigational drug/device) prior to conception or during pregnancy resulted in an
adverse outcome in the child. Examples: malformation in the offspring cause by thalidomide.
   f) Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization
may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one
of the outcomes listed in this definition.
Unexpected Adverse Event--Any untoward experience not identified in the protocol and or the consent
form. For investigational drugs, unexpected is defined as any adverse drug experience that is not listed in
the current investigators brochure. These include events that may be symptomatically and pathophysio-
logically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differ from the event because of greater severity or
specificity.
Assent--A minor’s affirmative agreement to participate in a research investigation.
Associate Investigators--Members of the Air Force or other governmental agencies, and individuals at
civilian universities, private institutions, or pharmaceutical companies who collaborate with the principal
investigator.
Assurance of Compliance--A formal written, binding agreement that is submitted to a federal agency in
which an institution promises to comply with applicable regulations governing research with human sub-
jects and stipulates the procedures through which compliance will be achieved. The AF assurance is a
signed agreement between the institution commander and AFMOA/SGOT which assures that all research
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                        29


will be performed according to the requirements of this instruction, 32 CFR 219 and 10 United States
Code 980.
Authorized Institutional Official--Responsible for the oversight of research and IRB functions that has
the legal authority to act and speak for the institution. This individual may be the commander or may be
delegated to the director of research and development or flight commander. Selection of appropriate per-
sonnel will assure the protection of the rights and welfare not only of research subjects, but also the insti-
tution itself.
Behavioral Research--Human behavioral research is the application of the scientific method to the study
of physical and mental processes as they occur in individuals or groups in specific instances or across the
life span.
Biomedical Research-- This includes both studies designed primarily to increase the scientific base of
information about: (1) normal or abnormal physiology and development and (2) studies primarily
intended to evaluate the safety, effectiveness or usefulness of a medical product, procedure, intervention.
Certification--The official notification by the institution to the supporting department or agency, in accor-
dance with the requirements of this policy, that a research project or activity involving human subjects has
been reviewed and approved by an IRB in accordance with an approved assurance.
Classified Human Research--Research involving “classified national security information” as defined in
Executive Order 12958, sec, 1.1 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333). The following definitions preceded by an
* fall under the classified human research definition.
   *Classified National Security Information (hereinafter “classified information”)--Information that
has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958 or any predecessor order to require protection
against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.
   *Control --The authority of the agency that originates information, or its successor in function, to reg-
ulate access to the information.
   *Information --Any knowledge that can be communicated or documentary material, regardless of its
physical form or characteristics, that is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United
States Government.
   *Composition of Institutional Review Board--The nonaffiliated member shall not be an employee or
officer of the Federal Government (other than for purposes of membership on the IRB) and shall be
required to obtain any necessary security clearances.
    *Informed Consent--For classified research only:
 Human subjects must be provided with:
       (i) a disclosure that the project involves classified research and information sufficient to explain the
nature of the classified research; and
       (ii) a disclosure of the identity of the sponsoring agency, unless the head of the sponsoring agency
makes a written determination, after consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence and the Assis-
tant to the President for National Security Affairs, that providing this information could compromise
intelligence sources or methods and, after consultation with the Director of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) makes a written determination that the research involves no more
than minimal risk to subjects.
  (2) An IRB may require disclosure to the subjects of the research any classified information that the IRB
determines is necessary for the subjects to provide a valid informed consent.
30                                                                              AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


  (3) An IRB may not approve a consent procedure which alters or omits any of the consent requirements
in § .116 and may not waive the requirement that the investigator obtain informed consent and a signed
consent form for any classified research.
 *Expedited Review--An IRB shall not allow use of the expedited review process.
  *Approval by Agency Head--Within 30 days of IRB approval of a classified research project that has
not been appealed under paragraph (g) of this section, the head of the Department or Agency sponsoring
the classified research (e.g. Secretary of Defense), and not the Agency head’s designee or delegate, shall
review and issue a written approval or disapproval of that project.
   *Appeals from IRB Approvals of Classified Research--Any IRB approval of a classified research
project shall be subject to appeal by an individual member or members of the IRB.
   (1) Appeals of any IRB approval shall initially be submitted to the head of the Department or Agency
(e.g. Secretary of Defense) sponsoring the classified research within 20 days of the IRB approval. The
Department or Agency head must render a written decision within 60 days of the date the appeal is sub-
mitted. The decision of the Department or Agency head may affirm the IRB approval, reverse the IRB
approval, or remand the matter for further clarification from the IRB.
  (2) The IRB member or members may appeal a decision of the head of the Department or Agency (e.g.
Secretary of Defense) sponsoring the classified research that upholds the IRB approval to the Director of
OSTP who shall review the IRB’s decision and the decision of the head of the Department or Agency
sponsoring classified research and approve or disapprove the project, or, at the Director’s discretion, con-
vene an IRB made up of individuals who are not employees or officers of the Federal Government (other
than for purposes of membership on the IRB) each with the appropriate security clearances, to recom-
mend approval or disapproval of the project. The Director of OSTP must issue a written decision on the
appeal within 60 days of the date the appeal is submitted.
  *Reporting Requirements--The head of each Department or Agency sponsoring classified research (e.g.
DDR&E) within the previous 12-month period shall, no later than September 30th of each year, report to
the Director of OSTP the number of ongoing classified research projects involving human subjects and
the number of classified research projects completed in the previous 12-month period. Each report
required by this paragraph shall include the number of human subjects in each project and shall include
information accurate as of the date the report is filed.
   *Recordkeeping Requirements--The head of each Department or Agency sponsoring classified
research shall maintain permanent records of the deliberations of the IRB and the consent documents as
well as any other related documents generated in connection with the decision to approve or disapprove a
classified research project involving human subjects. (Information will be saved at the IRB level and
AFMOA/SGOT level)
  *Responsibilities of OSTP--The Director of OSTP shall report the total number of classified research
projects and participating subjects to the President and shall then report to the congressional armed ser-
vices and intelligence committees and further shall publish the numbers in the Federal Register.
Clinical Investigation--A systematic investigation or study designed to develop or contribute to general-
izable knowledge that is performed by, or together with, medical service personnel, usually in medical
service facilities. The term does not include individual or group training of military personnel, such as
combat readiness, effectiveness, proficiency, or fitness exercises.
Continuing Review--A periodic review of a research protocol by the IRB. The review must be substan-
tive and meaningful, i.e., IRB members should receive and review a protocol summary and a status report
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                         31


on the progress of the research including (1) the number of subjects accrued; (2) a description of adverse
events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects, withdrawal of subjects; (3) and a summary
of any recent literature or findings, amendments or modifications of the research since the last review,
especially information about adverse events associated with the research. Continuing review must occur
at least intervals that are appropriate to the degree of risk, but not more than 365 days from the date of the
previous IRB review. If the protocol was initially evaluated by a full IRB it must continue to undergo full
board approval for any subsequent continuing reviews.
Cooperative Project Assurance--A streamlined assurance document developed to minimize effort in
administering assurances for diverse Cooperative Protocol Research Programs (CPRPs). This Assurance
is issued by the Office for Protection for Research Risks.
Cooperative Protocol Research Program--Are community-based, multi-center and multi-protocol in
nature. This design brings the research to the subjects by dividing protocols widely and pooling resultant
data to hasten conclusions and publication findings. All CPRP protocols undergo central review by the
sponsoring DHHS agency (or sometimes by OPRR on the agency's behalf) prior to the release by the
CPRP coordinating center for use by collaborating accrual sites.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)--The U.S. Government’s principal agency (execu-
tive branch) for protecting the health of Americans and providing essential human services. DHHS is
comprised of operating divisions (1) the Public Health Service Divisions (including the Food and Drug
Administration, the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control, Indian Health Service) and
(2) Human Services Divisions.
Deviation--A one time departure from the IRB approved research protocol.
Devices--Medical devices are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. FDA has established pro-
cedures for obtaining an “Investigational Device Exemption” (IDE) which applies to investigations con-
ducted to determine the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.
    The IDE regulations, 21 CFR 812, distinguish between Significant Risk (SR) devices and Non-Signif-
icant Risk (NSR) devices. Use of either kind of device in research requires IRB approval and use of
informed consent.
    Significant risk devices are those which present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or wel-
fare of subjects, and are subject to FDA control and approval. To obtain FDA approval, the IRB must first
review and approve; then the sponsor, i.e., the person or firm which initiates the investigation, submits an
application for an IDE to the FDA. Examples of significant risk devices are implants and life-supporting
equipment.
   Non-significant risk devices include such items as crutches, elastic knee braces, bed boards, bedpans,
medical chairs, and tongue depressors. In order to obtain approval to use a non-significant risk device, the
investigator must submit a protocol to the IRB. The IRB must then determine the risk of the device.
Drugs--The Food and Drug Administration regulates the use of Investigational New Drugs (IND) (21
Code of Federal Regulations 50, 56, 312, and 314. An IND is defined as a new antibiotic, biologic or drug
permitted by FDA to be tested in humans but not yet determined to be safe and effective for use in the
general population and not yet licensed for marketing. FDA considers any clinical investigation involv-
ing an IND(s) to pose greater than minimal risks to subject; and, therefore requires full IRB review.
Emergency Use of Investigational Drugs or Devices--Emergency use of investigational drugs or devices
on a human subject may be deemed necessary in a life-threatening situation. Emergency use is only for
32                                                                                AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


cases in which no standard acceptable treatment is available, and in which there is not enough time to
obtain normal protocol approval.
Exempt Research Activities--Research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be
in one or more of the following categories are exempt:
   (1) Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involving normal
educational practices, such as (i) research on regular and special education instructional strategies, or
(ii) research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or
classroom management methods.
   (2) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), sur-
vey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior, unless:
(i) Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human subjects can be identified, directly or
through identifiers linked to the subjects; and
(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research could reasonably place the sub-
jects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability,
or reputation.
   (3) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), sur-
vey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior is not exempt under paragraph 32
CFR 219.101 (b)(2), if:
(i) The human subjects are elected or appointed public officials or candidates for public office; or
(ii) Federal statute(s) require(s) without exception that the confidentiality of the personally identifiable
information will be maintained throughout the research and thereafter.
  (4) Research, involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, records, pathological speci-
mens, or diagnostic specimens, if these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded by
the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked
to the subjects.
Expedited Review--Review of proposed research by the IRB chair or a designated voting member or
group of voting members rather than by the entire IRB. Federal rules permit expedited review of certain
kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk and for minor changes in approved research.
Full Board Review--Review of proposed research at a convened meeting at which a majority of the mem-
bership of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific
areas. For research to be approved, it must receive the approval of a majority of those members present at
the meeting. Convened meetings may be conducted via telephone conference call providing each IRB
member has received all pertinent material prior to the meeting, and each member can actively and
equally participate in the discussion of the protocol. Minutes must clearly document that these two con-
ditions have been met.
Human Subject--A living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) con-
ducting research obtains
  (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
  (2) Identifiable private information.
Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example, venipuncture)
and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes.
Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject. ``Private
information'' includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can rea-
sonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                      33


for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made
public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the
identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the informa-
tion) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects.
Informed Consent--A person’s voluntary agreement, based upon adequate knowledge and understanding
of relevant information, to participate in research or to undergo a diagnostic, therapeutic, or preventive
procedure. In giving informed consent, subjects may not waive or appear to waive any of their legal
rights, or release or appear to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or agents thereof from
liability for negligence.
Informed Consent Document (ICD)- A written consent document approved by the IRB. This document
enables the investigator to obtain the legally effective consent of the subject or the subject’s legal guard-
ian. The ICD provides the prospective subject or the subject’s representative with sufficient information
to decide whether to participate in the proposed study.
Informed Consent Process--The informed consent process is intended to give a subject all the informa-
tion that an individual reasonably would want about a study; to ensure that the subject understands this
information; and to give the subject an opportunity to agree or decline to participate in the study. The pro-
cess provides for interaction between the investigator and the subject.
Institution--Any public or private entity or agency (including federal, state, and other agencies).
Interaction--Communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject
Intervention--Physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example venipuncture) and manipula-
tion of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes.
Institutional Review Board (IRB)--A specially constituted review body established or designed by an
entity to protect the welfare of human subjects recruited to participate in biomedical or behavioral
research.
IRB Approval--The determination of the IRB that the research has been reviewed and may be conducted
at an institution within the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and federal require-
ments. This is required prior to AIO approval of research activities.
Institutionalized Mentally Infirm Person--Any person who is confined, whether by court order, volun-
tary commitment, or otherwise, in an institution for the care of the mentally ill, the retarded, the emotion-
ally disturbed, the psychotic, or the senile, and others with impairments of similar nature, regardless of
whether or not such person has been determined to be legally incompetent and regardless of whether or
not he or she is capable of giving legally effective consent.
Investigational Drugs or Devices--Drugs or devices which are not FDA-approved for marketing. These
include drugs or devices for which the FDA has provided either a notice of exemption as an Investiga-
tional New Drug (IND), or an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), as appropriate.
Legally Authorized Representative--An individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable
law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the procedure(s) involved
in the research.
Life Threatening--A situation where delay of immediate treatment would result in loss of life or serious
bodily injury to the subject.
34                                                                               AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


Medical Misadventure--An unauthorized deviation from an approved research protocol that has the
potential to cause or has brought about injury or loss of life to a study subject. May be the result of human
error or intentional alteration of the study procedures.
Medical Monitor--For any research involving human subjects an independent medical monitor may be
appointed by name if the IRB determines that the research risk is greater than minimal. Medical monitors
will be independent of the investigative team. Possess sufficient educational and professional experience
i.e., physicians, dentists, psychologists, or other health care providers and be capable of overseeing the
progress of the research protocol, especially issues of individual subject management and safety.
Mentally Disabled Person--Any person who, due to mental illness, mental retardation, emotional distur-
bance, psychosis, senility, or other impairment of a similar nature, is not capable of giving legally effec-
tive informed consent.
Minimal Risk--Minimal risk means the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in
the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during
the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
Minor--Any person, other than active duty military personnel, who has not attained the legal age of con-
sent to treatments or procedures involved in the investigation. This age is determined under the applica-
ble law of the jurisdiction in which the investigation is to be conducted.
Multiple Project Assurance (MPA) -A Multiple Project Assurance (MPA) is a document to assure com-
pliance of an institution with federal regulations on protection of human research subjects. The Office for
Protections from Research Risks (OPRR) is responsible for issuing MPA’s for DHHS supported research.
The issuing agency for the Air Force assurances is AFMOA/SGOT.
Office of Protection from Research Risks (OPRR)--Responsible agency for developing and implement-
ing policies, procedures, and regulations to protect human and animal subjects involved in research spon-
sored by the DHHS.
Principal Investigator (PI)--A person responsible for the conduct of the research trial at a trial site. If a
team of individuals conducts the research, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team and may
be called the principal investigator. "Associate investigator" includes any other individual involved with
the research protocol.
Prisoner--Any person who is involuntarily confined in a penal or correctional institution, whether the
institution is for the confinement or rehabilitation of juvenile offenders, for persons charged with or con-
victed of civil or criminal offenses, or for other purposes.
Private Information--Information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can rea-
sonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided
for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made
public (for example, a medical record).
Protocol--The written, formal design or plan of an experiment or research activity. In the context of this
regulation, the plan submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Elements of a protocol are outlined in
Attachment 2.
Radiation Safety Office (RSO)--Approves certain radioactive drugs for use in human research subjects
that otherwise might require an IND or an approved New Drug Application (NDA). The radioactive drug
may be used to obtain basic information regarding human physiology, pathophysiology, or biochemistry.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                       35


The radioactive drug may not be used for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes or to
determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug in humans.
Regional IRB--IRBs that review investigational studies for institutions without an established IRB or
Assurance within a specific region. Regional IRBs have the same responsibility to human subject protec-
tion as if the extrinsic research study was approved at the IRB's institution Air Force Regional IRBs are:
Wilford Hall Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, David Grant Medical Center and Wright Patterson
Medical Center. They are responsible agents to evaluate research for compliance with the CFR and DoD
regulations.
Research--A systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed
to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition constitute
research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program
which is considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs
may include research activities.
Research subject to regulation--(and similar terms) Are intended to encompass those research activities
for which a federal department or agency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research activity,
(for example, Investigational New Drug requirements administered by the Food and Drug administra-
tion). It does not include research activities which are incidentally regulated by a federal department or
agency solely as part of the department's or agency's broader responsibility to regulate certain types of
activities whether research or non-research in nature (for example, Wage and Hour requirements adminis-
tered by the Department of Labor).
Research Focus Area--A general category of military medicine in which a study's relevance may be
described. The Research focus area of an investigative study may include any of the following five cate-
gories: Medical Readiness (MR), Prevention (Primary P-1, Secondary P-2, Tertiary P-3), Medical Utili-
zation (MU), Managed Care (MC), or Treatment, Diagnosis or Other (TDO).
Scientific Misconduct--Fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing
research, or in reporting research results. Fabrication is making up results and recording or reporting
them. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting
data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. Plagiarism is the
appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit,
including those obtained through confidential review of others' research proposals and manuscripts.
Research misconduct does not include honest error or honest differences of opinion. A finding of
research misconduct requires that: there be a significant departure from accepted practices of the scientific
community for maintaining the integrity of the research record; the misconduct be committed intention-
ally, or knowingly, or in reckless disregard of accepted practices; and the allegation be proven by a pre-
ponderance of evidence.
Single Project Assurance (SPA)--A written assurance that an institution will comply with federal regula-
tions on protection of human research subjects. SPAs are limited in use and duration to a single research
protocol. Institutions not holding a MPA with the Air Force AFMOA/SGOT office or the DHHS Office
for Protections from Research Risks must negotiate a SPA with AFMOA/SGOT prior to initiation of the
research protocol.
Subject Consent--Informed consent given by a prospective human subject who has the legal capacity to
give such consent. For active duty military personnel participating in a US Air Force research investiga-
tion or collaborative study, there is no minimum age limitation. Consent must be given voluntarily, freely,
36                                                                              AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


and without any use of force, fraud, deceit, duress, constraint, coercion, or unlawful or improper induce-
ment. The subject must possess sufficient understanding of the implications of his or her participation in
the study in order to make an informed decision. A subject is free to withdraw participation at any time
without jeopardizing his or her rights to treatment.
Surgeon General's Research Oversight Committee -(SGROC)--The SGROC meets quarterly to address
issues related to protections of human subjects and animal research. SGROC members provide a compre-
hensive and expert second level review of research protocols initially approved by AF IRBs.
Surveys--Data collection, using personal or telephonic interviews, or self-administered questionnaires,
etc. from a sample of ten or more persons, to elicit information. Examples of types of information
include, attitudes, opinions, behavior, or demographic, social, or economic data, used for research and/or
policy assessment. The key documents guiding survey requirements are DoD Instruction 1100.13 and
AFI 36-2601. Surveys of attitudes and opinions of Air Force service members beyond the IRB’s jurisdic-
tion are subject to approval by HQ AFPC/DPSAS, Randolph AFB, TX (See AFI 36-2601)
Technical Assistants--Civilian employees or agents of nonfederal organizations, such as national cancer
study groups, who provide to the Air Force, at no cost to the government, a wide variety of administrative,
technical, or professional services in support of a research investigation protocol or program. The person-
nel rendering the services are not normally subject to the control and supervision of federal supervisors,
which usually occurs in relationships between the government and its employees.
Third Party Consent--Consent given by the parents, legal guardian, or other legally authorized third party
who represents the prospective human subject’s welfare and interest. Third party consent may be used if
the prospective human subject legally is not capable of giving consent. This third party consent is subject
to all of the same criteria for full and complete disclosure as is the subject’s own consent, and must be
freely given.
Unanticipated Medical Event--An unforeseeable, unpreventable event that causes injury or loss of life to
a study subject, after all the guidelines set forth in an approved clinical investigation protocol have been
followed. An adverse drug reaction is an example of such an event.
Voluntary--Free of coercion, duress, or undue inducement. Used in the research context to refer to a sub-
ject’s decision to participate (or continue to participate) in a research activity.

MEMORANDUM FOR (Office Symbol - Institutional Review Board)
FROM: (Your Office Symbol / Investigator(s) Name, Address)
SUBJECT: Serious or Unexpected Adverse Event
1. Protocol Number: (XXX-YYYY-NNNN)
2. Protocol Title:
3. Type of Adverse Event: (Choose one below - Serious Adverse Event or Unexpected Adverse Event)
Serious Adverse Event (If reporting a Serious Adverse Event, choose one of the types listed below, delete
others)
     a) Death – report all deaths (except National Cooperative Oncology studies, report fatal toxicity's.)
     b) Life-threatening adverse experience – report if the patient was at substantial risk of dying at the
     time of the adverse event or it is suspected that continued involvement in the research protocol (e.g.,
     that the use or continued use of product under investigation would result in the patient’s death.)
     Examples: pacemaker failure; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; bone marrow suppression; infusion pump
     failure (except National Cancer Institute studies: report life threatening tonicities)
     c) Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization – report if admission to the
     hospital or prolongation of a hospital stay results because of an adverse event. Examples: anaphy-
     laxis; bleeding causing or prolonging hospitalization.)
     d) Persistent or significant disability/incapacity – report if the adverse event resulted in a signifi-
     cant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient’s body func-
     tion/structure, physical activities or quality of life. Examples: CVA due to drug-induced
     hypercoagulability; toxicity; peripheral neuropathy.
     e) Congenital anomaly/birth defect – report if there are suspicions that exposure during the course
     of a research study (e.g., investigational drug/device) prior to conception or during pregnancy resulted
     in an adverse outcome in the child. Examples: malformation in the offspring cause by thalidomide.
     f) Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization
     may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment,
     they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to pre-
     vent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
                                                     OR
Unexpected Adverse Events - In general, an unexpected adverse event is any untoward experience not
identified in the protocol and or the consent form. For investigational drugs, unexpected is defined as any
adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product. These include
events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but
differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity. The key to classifying adverse events is
they are not listed in the current product label, in the Investigator’s Brochure and not included in the risk

                         TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN AIR FORCE MEDICAL TREATMENT
FACILITY AND DONOR
Purpose: This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is established to coordinate the services of tech-
nical assistance provided to the Air Force in support of an Air Force Clinical, Biological, or Behavioral
Research study. Technical assistants are defined as employees or agents of nonfederal organizations who
provide a wide variety of services to the Air Force in support of a research investigation protocol or pro-
gram. These services include administrative, technical, or professional support and are provided at no cost
to the government.
Reference: AFPD 40-4
Background:
       Air Force Information:
       It is Air Force policy to encourage and support clinical, biomedical and behavioral research that
contributes to the progress of the biomedical sciences and to the efficiency of the Air Force or other mili-
tary Medical Services.
        The Air Force Surgeon General, or designee, through the Surgeon General’s Research Oversight
Committee, will review and render an approval or disapproval decision on clinical, biomedical and behav-
ioral research protocols.
        Research is an essential component of optimal health care, and consists of organized scientific
inquiry into problems involving the health care of Department of Defense beneficiaries. The goals of the
Air Force Clinical and Biomedical Research include: Achieving continuous improvement in the quality
of subject care. Providing experience in the essential discipline of organized scientific inquiry to person-
nel whom will ultimately become teaching chiefs and consultants in Air Force MTFs. Strengthening the
Graduate Medical Education (GME) program.
       Donor Information:
        Description of the organization which is making the offer of service(s). (Example: The ABC Orga-
nization is a not-for-profit corporation created to encourage and support clinical research and medical
education.)
       The (donor) is or is not a defense contractor. (Choose one either is or is not.)
         The (donor) has the capability to provide the services of trained personnel (professional technical,
and administrative) to support Air Force Surgeon General-approved clinical/biological research at (loca-
tion) at no cost to the government.
Procedures:
Management of clinical investigations technical assistance services: (Donor) may proffer technical assis-
tants in support of the research facility. Such technical assistants must abide by all applicable and Air
Force rules and regulations.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                       57


         (Donor) must ensure that such technical assistants clearly understand that the services rendered
will be performed without any form of compensation from the US Government.
         (Donor) will provide workman’s compensation, pay social security taxes, and provide liability
insurance and credentials, when required, on all personnel provided as technical assistants to (AF research
facility). The donor agrees to inform the Air Force of any change in its technical assistants insurance cov-
erage during the period of service. The (donor) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the United States,
its agents and employees against all liability resulting from the services of its technical assistants.
Note: You should obtain this provision as part of the agreement when possible; however, if you cannot,
then decide whether it is in the best interest of the Air Force to enter into the agreement without the
hold-harmless clause. You should contact your staff judge advocate or medical law consultant before
making this decision.
       To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest Air Force medical personnel assigned to or
employed (AF research facility) may only receive financial compensation for participation as a subject of
research, provided DoD funds are not used for payment and off duty employment is authorized. (Refer-
ence 24 U.S.C. 30)
         (Donor) will notify the (AF research facility), in writing, of any proposed offer of technical assis-
tance. Prepare such a letter of proffer for each individual who will provide technical assistance. The letter
should include the following: name of individual, the nature of their support, and the expected duration of
their participation in the one or more clinical investigation protocols or programs for which support is
being proffered.
        (Donor) proposals for technical assistance services related to clinical investigation protocols will
be approved by the facility Commander.


(Donor) agrees to provide information on the number of technical assistants supporting research efforts at
(AF research facility) upon request, as a means of confirming internal Air Force audit information.
Standards of Conduct:
Nothing in this agreement pertaining to clinical investigation, technical assistance, or medical education
support obviates Air Force requirements pertaining to prevention of conflict of interest or adherence to
standards of conduct.
Agreement:
The Commander (AF research facility), and the (Title of Individual) of (Donor) hereby agree to enter into
this MOU to establish procedures for (Donor) to provide technical assistance in support of patient care
and research effort at the (AF research facility).
Effective Date:
This agreement becomes effective upon the signature of both parties and remains in effect until canceled.
Modification of This Agreement:
This agreement will be reviewed biennially at least 90 days prior to the anniversary date. It may be
revised at any time upon the written mutual consent of the parties concerned.

1. Statement of Principles and Policies
       a. Ethical Principles
       This facility is guided by the ethical principles regarding all research involving humans as subjects
       as set forth in the report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Bio
       medical and Behavioral Research entitled, Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of
       Human Subjects of Research (the "Belmont Report"). In addition, the requirements set forth in
       Title 32 Part 219 of the Code of Federal Regulations (32 CFR 219) will be met for all DoD-
       supported research.
       b. Facility Policy
               (1) This facility acknowledges and accepts its responsibilities for protecting the rights and
               welfare of human subjects of research covered by this assurance.
               (2) It is the policy of this facility that, except for research in which the only involvement of
               human subjects is in one or more of the categories exempted under 32 CFR
               219.101(b)(1-6) or 219.101.e of the DoD regulations, this policy is applicable to all
               research involving human subjects, and all other activities which are even in part such
               research, if either:
                       (a) The research is sponsored by this facility, or
                       (b) The research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of
                       this facility in connection with his or her facility responsibilities, or
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                     61


                   (c) The research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of
                   this facility using any property or component of this facility, or
                   (d) The research involves the use of this facility's nonpublic information to identify
                   or contact human research subjects or prospective subjects.
           (2) It is the policy of this facility that, except for those categories specifically exempted by
           32 CFR 219, no research investigator shall involve any human being as a subject in
           research unless the research investigator has obtained the legally effective informed con
           sent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Categories of
           exemption as defined above {32 CFR 219.101 paragraph (b)(1-6) and paragraph (e)} shall
           not be confused with minimal risk categories as defined at 32 CFR 219.117. IRB waiver
           of informed consent, as defined at 32 CFR 219.117, is not permitted within DoD (see Title
           10, USC 980). Human subjects research defined as "minimal risk" is permitted expedited
           review; however, informed consent shall not be waived.
           (3) This facility acknowledges and accepts its responsibilities for protecting the rights and
           welfare of human subjects of research covered by this policy.
           (4) This facility assures that before human subjects are involved in research covered by
           this policy, proper consideration will be given to:
                   (a) The risks to the subjects,
                   (b) The anticipated benefits to the subjects and others,
                   (c) The importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to results,
                   and
                   (d) The informed consent process to be employed.
           (5) This facility acknowledges that it bears full responsibility for the performance of all
           research involving human subjects, covered by this policy.
           (6) This facility bears full responsibility for complying with federal, state, or local laws as
           they may relate to research covered by this policy.
           (7) This facility encourages and promotes constructive communication among the research
           administrators, department heads, research investigators, clinical care staff, human
           subjects, and facility officials as a means of maintaining a high level of awareness
           regarding safeguarding of the rights and welfare of the subjects.
           (8) This facility will exercise appropriate administrative overview carried out at least
           annually to insure that its practices and procedures designed for the protection of the rights
           and welfare of human subjects are being effectively applied.
           (9) This facility will consider additional safeguards in research when that research
           involves pregnant women, children, other potentially vulnerable groups and human in
           vitro fertilization.
           (10) This facility shall provide each individual at the facility conducting or reviewing
           human subject research (e.g., research investigators, department heads, research
           administrators, and research reviewers) with a copy of this statement of ethical principles
           and policy.

   AF/SG POLICY GOVERNING CATEGORIZATION OF RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,
     TESTING AND EVALUATION (RDT&E) ACTIVITIES AS “HUMAN RESEARCH”
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON DC

April 18, 2005
MEMORANDUM FOR SEE DISTRIBUTION
FROM: HQ USAF/SG
1780 Air Force Pentagon
Washington DC 20330-1780
SUBJECT: Interim Policy Governing Categorization of Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation
(RDT&E) Activities as
References: (a) AFI 40-402, Protection of Human Subjects in Biomedical and Behavioral Research
                 (b) DoDD 3216.2, Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in
                 DoD-Supported Research
                 (c) 32 CFR 219, Protection of Human Subjects
The Air Force Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) community has traditionally
acted outside the realm of “human research,” regulated by separate requirements, guidelines and over-
sight (e.g., AFI 91-202, Safety Investigations and Reports; AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investiga-
tions and Reports; AFI 63-101, Operations of Capabilities-Based Acquisition System; DoD Directive
5141.2, Director of Operational Test and Evaluation [DOT&E]). Recent guidance from DoD indicates
that, though many RDT&E activities are properly classified as non-research, some are considered “human
research” requiring AF/SG and human subjects protection oversight. Research is defined as a “systematic
investigation, including research, testing, development, and evaluation designed to develop or contribute
towards generalizable knowledge.” (Ref. c) While all 2-letters are responsible for ensuring the compli-
ance of activities conducted under their purview, the AF Surgeon General has been delegated the authority
to oversee all human research conducted in the AF (both medical and non-medical) and the responsibility
to ensure the protection of human subjects. This policy applies to human research funded or conducted by
the USAF and provides guidance on categorizing RDT&E activities involving human subjects as either
non-research or as human research requiring oversight by the AF/SG and compliance with applicable
laws and regulations.
RDT&E activities involving human research could include the biological, behavioral, or psychological
study of a human or the effects of a test thereon, such as: test exposure to any agent (e.g., lasers, electro-
magnetic energy, solvents); deviation from normal daily regimens; and active manipulation of bodily pro-
cesses, behavior, or the environment in which human factors are measured.
It is surmised that the majority of AF RDT&E activities are non-research. Research and non-research may
employ similar investigative methods, but the latter is not intended to test a theory or to produce general-
izable knowledge. Examples of activities that are generally either not considered human research or that
are exempt from human research regulations (Refs a-c) include:
66                                                                              AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


       a. “Exempt” activities meeting the requirements in 32 CFR 219.101(b), unless otherwise required
       by the USAF or local policy.
       b. Individual or group training of military personnel such as combat readiness, effectiveness,
       proficiency, or fitness exercises.
       c. Operational test and evaluation activities where the purpose of the tests is to make assessments
       regarding the attributes of a weapon, equipment, or munitions, including human/machine
       interfacing systems related thereto.
       d. Health readiness surveillance, such as activities carried out, under 10 U.S.C. 1074f (medical
       tracking system for members deployed overseas).
       e. Quality assurance, such as activities covered by 10 U.S.C. 1102 and DoD Directive 6025.13,
       "Medical Quality Assurance in the Military Health System," May 4, 2004.
       f. Evaluations of the success of established programs in achieving objectives or customer
       satisfaction surveys, when performed for use by program managers.
       g. Compliance Monitoring: Monitoring for compliance of individuals and organizations with
       requirements applicable to military, civilian, or contractor personnel or to organizational units.
       This includes such activities as drug testing, occupational health and safety monitoring, and
       security clearance reviews.
When considering whether to categorize an activity as non-research, it is crucial to be aware of certain
complicating factors. Activities obtaining data on the effects of any non-routine interaction with an indi-
vidual can be viewed as human research. Non-research activities may include components of research
activities that are subject to human subject protection regulations. Publication or presentation of results
can indicate intent to make knowledge generalizable, thus characterizing the activity as human research.
Complicating factors such as these make it essential that qualified, trained individuals review RDT&E
activities in order to determine whether human research is involved.
Each 2-letter shall designate an individual to serve as the organization’s Research Reviewer. The desig-
nated individual shall be sufficiently qualified through experience, expertise, and training to be able to
ascertain the acceptability of the proposed activity, while being sufficiently removed from the activity to
avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Research Reviewer shall be responsible for reviewing
the 2 letter’s activities with humans to determine whether human research is involved and, if so, whether
the activity can be classified as “Exempt” from References (a)-(c) as per 32 CFR 219.101. In questionable
cases, Research Reviewers shall seek the advice of an AF Institutional Review Board (IRB). All human
research activities determined by the Research Reviewer to be non-exempt must be submitted to and
approved by an appropriate IRB prior to initiation. Furthermore, the research must be conducted under an
assurance of compliance approved by AFMSA/SGRC. The Research Reviewer will maintain reports doc-
umenting their determinations. These reports shall summarize all activities reviewed, state whether they
were determined to involve human research, and reference which, if any, Exempt category (32 CFR
219.101) was applied. AFMSA/SGRC will be responsible for review of these reports. The Research
Reviewer will be subject to approval, training (See Attachment), and oversight by AFMSA/SGRC who,
until a Research Reviewer has been trained, shall perform the Research Reviewer’s function. Detailed
instructions on reviewing and reporting requirements shall be provided to designated Research Reviewers
by AFMSA/SGRC.
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                        67


AF/SGR, under authority of the AF Surgeon General, may grant exceptions to this policy when deemed
appropriate in light of each 2 letter’s activities. This policy guidance is not intended to circumvent any
applicable code, law, regulation, directive, or instruction, but empowers the responsible organizations via
the Research Reviewer process to make independent determinations regarding the applicability of human
subjects protection regulations to ensure compliance therewith.
This policy supersedes all previous policy pertaining to this issue. Please direct questions to Col Peter
Demitry, Assistant Surgeon General, Modernization, DSN 761-7055.

Certified by: AF/SGR (Col Peter F. Demitry)
Supersedes AFI 40-402, 1 September 2000
1.1. Description. In 1991, the DoD, along with 16 federal agencies, adopted regulations that are known
collectively as the Common Federal Rule. Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 219, “Protection of
Human Subjects" applies to all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Department of Health

3.1. Assurances. All human research conducted or supported by the Air Force shall be conducted under
an Assurance of compliance acceptable to the Air Force, unless the research is exempt from these regula-
tions under 32 CFR 219.101(b). See 32 CFR 219.103(a). A DoD Assurance is required for research per-
formed at DoD facilities and funded by the DoD. A DoD Assurance issued by the Air Force is required for
research conducted by the Air Force at an Air Force facility. Any changes to an Assurance covering
research conducted or supported by the Air Force must be prospectively approved by AFMSA/SGRC.
3.1.1. DoD Assurances issued by the Air Force. Applications for DoD Assurances issued by the Air Force
must be reviewed and approved by AFMSA/SGRC prior to initiation of any human research. Completed
applications must be forwarded to AFMSA/SGRC with policies and procedures for local IRB operation,
including those governing continuing review of the research. All IRBs designated in DoD Assurances
issued by the Air Force must be registered with AFMSA/SGRC along with an IRB membership roster.
AFMSA/SGRC shall issue every Assurance a tracking number. The Air Force issues two types of Assur-
ances: the Multiple Project Assurance (MPA) and the Single Project Assurance (SPA).
3.1.1.1 DELETED.
3.1.2. SPA
3.1.2.1. An SPA applies to only one project. Documentation of IRB review and approval of the covered
study must be submitted to AFMSA/SGR along with the SPA application. SPAs are awarded for up to
three years, subject to continuing review. A SPA institution that has demonstrated compliance with Assur-
ance requirements may submit application for a MPA.
3.1.2.2. SPA for an Institution Utilizing Another Air Force Institution’s IRB. When an institution such as
a small clinic does not have an IRB, before conducting human research supported or conducted by the Air
Force, it must obtain both a valid DoD Assurance issued by the Air Force and review and approval from
a regional Air Force IRB.
3.1.2.3 International Assurance. All research taking place outside of the U.S. and conducted or supported
by the Air Force must be conducted under an International Assurance acceptable to AFMSA/SGRC as per
paragraph 3.1.4.1. Research conducted at Air Force facilities outside of the U.S. must be conducted under
a DoD International SPA issued by the Air Force through AFMSA/AGRC. Due to legal, ethical, and cul-
72                                                                               AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


tural differences between the U.S. and the foreign country in which the research will take place, IRBs,
AFMSA/SGRC, and investigators are instructed to take extra care in reviewing, approving, and conduct-
ing international research to ensure compliance with the spirit of ethical guidelines for the protection of
human research subjects, as well as the letter of the law. See paragraph 3.2.5. of this instruction for addi-
tional information on conducting research outside of the U.S.
3.1.3. MPA. An MPA can apply to one or more human research projects.
3.1.3.1. Submit requests for an MPA to AFMSA/SGRC. Requests must include a statement of principles
and policies, documentation of IRB review and local policies for IRB operation.
3.1.4. Non-Air Force Assurances. In most cases, a DoD Assurance will be required. However, in some
cases, AFMSA/SGRC may accept an Assurance issued by DHHS. Whenever the Air Force accepts an
Assurance not issued by the Air Force, the institution must provide a separate written assurance that it will
comply with requirements unique to the Air Force, including this instruction and all attachments, and that
it will report to the Air Force continuing compliance and safety issues, such as continuing reviews,
adverse events, and protocol deviations, in accordance with this instruction.
3.1.4.1. Copies of all non-Air Force Assurances submitted by Air Force institutions must be provided to
AFMSA/SGRC in order to ensure proper coordination with the Assurance-granting agency and compli-
ance with the requirements outlined in this instruction.
3.1.4.2. Federalwide Assurance (FWA). DHHS issues FWAs for research funded by DHHS. Institutions
participating in NCI Clinical Trials Cooperative Group projects are required to obtain an FWA from
DHHS because NCI is an institute within DHHS. Air Force Institutions needing a DHHS FWA should not
check the box on the FWA electing to apply the FWA to all of its human research.
3.1.4.3. Cooperative Project Assurance (CPA). A CPA is an Assurance previously issued by DHHS for
facilities involved in NCI’s Clinical Trials Cooperative Group studies.
3.2. Requirements for Special Categories of Human Subjects. The use of human subjects in research
in which there is an intervention or interaction with subjects is limited to persons who are fully informed
and who voluntarily agree to participate in the study. If the subject is legally incompetent to give consent
(as with infirmed, minors, or patients in an unconscious state) and the proposed measures are intended to
benefit the subject, then consent may be obtained from a legal guardian on the subject's behalf. Research
supported or conducted by the Department of Defense that affects the following vulnerable populations
shall meet the additional protections of 45 CFR 46, Subparts B-D: fetuses, pregnant women, or human in
vitro fertilization (Subpart B); prisoners (Subpart C); and minors (Subpart D).
3.2.4.1. Prisoners of War. The use of prisoners of war as research subjects is unequivocally prohibited.
See DoD Directive 3216.2, paragraph 4.4.2.
3.2.6. Protocols Involving Biological or Chemical Warfare Agents. Research involving the use of human
subjects for testing of chemical or biological warfare agents or nuclear weapons effects is generally pro-
hibited. See DoDD 3216.2, paragraph 4.4.5., and 50 USC 1520a. Such research must be submitted to
OUSDAT for approval prior to implementation.
3.6.1. The SGROC must review and approve all greater than minimal risk protocols prior to initiation
except as noted in 3.6.2. below. Protocols that are determined by the IRB to be no more than minimal risk
to the subject must be sent to AFMSA/SGRC, which shall conduct audits in order to ensure compliance.
Minimal risk studies may begin upon local IRB and Commander/AIO approval. Protocols that are deter-
mined to be exempt by the IRB Chair or designee must be evaluated using written criteria, reported to
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                     73


AFMSA/SGRC, and documented in the IRB minutes and in section 8 of the OF 310. The exemption must
be referenced using the appropriate CFR rule. The OF 310 must be kept on file for audit purposes. If the
SGROC disagrees with the IRB’s determination, the research study may be temporarily suspended until
resolution. Guidance for document submission to the SGROC is included in this instruction (Attachment
7).
3.9.1. Air Force institutions must ensure that research is conducted under the highest ethical standards. In
support of this responsibility, every allegation of research misconduct shall be investigated. All allega-
tions of research misconduct shall be investigated in an independent, unbiased, and equitable manner that
minimizes disruption to research in process unless the research misconduct could result in a threat to pub-
lic health or safety . Written institutional policy governing research misconduct must be established in
accordance with the requirements of DoDI 3210.7 and submitted to AFMSA/SGRC.
3.9.1.3. All allegations of research misconduct occurring within an institution shall be referred to and
investigated by the AIO; however, SGR may investigate the allegation if there is a determination that 1)
the institution is unable to conduct a thorough and unbiased inquiry and/or investigation; 2) it is in the
public interest for the parent command to conduct the inquiry and investigation; or 3) the allegation
involves a small institution or an individual that cannot reasonably be expected to respond. SGR shall
investigate allegations of research misconduct occurring outside of an Air Force institution.
4.1.7. Contractors must notify the US Air Force contracting agency and obtain IRB approval of any
changes to the protocol prior to implementation. Contractors must have written procedures for notifying
the US Air Force contracting agency of any misadventure or unanticipated adverse medical event that
coincides with or possibly results from using human subjects in a US Air Force-sponsored research proto-
col. Include all the information required in paragraph 2.7. of this instruction.

1. Statement of Principles and Policies
       a. Ethical Principles
       This facility is guided by the ethical principles regarding all research involving humans as subjects
       as set forth in the report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Bio
       medical and Behavioral Research entitled, Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of
       Human Subjects of Research (the "Belmont Report"). In addition, the requirements set forth in
       Title 32 Part 219 of the Code of Federal Regulations (32 CFR 219) will be met for all DoD-
       supported research.
       b. Facility Policy
              (1) This facility acknowledges and accepts its responsibilities for protecting the rights and
              welfare of human subjects of research covered by this assurance.
              (2) It is the policy of this facility that, except for research in which the only involvement of
              human subjects is in one or more of the categories exempted under 32 CFR
              219.101(b)(1-6) or 219.101.e of the DoD regulations, this policy is applicable to all
              research involving human subjects, and all other activities which are even in part such
              research, if either:
                      (a) The research is sponsored by this facility, or
                      (b) The research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of
                      this facility in connection with his or her facility responsibilities, or
                      (c) The research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of
                      this facility using any property or component of this facility, or
                      (d) The research involves the use of this facility's nonpublic information to identify
                      or contact human research subjects or prospective subjects.
              (2) It is the policy of this facility that, except for those categories specifically exempted by
              32 CFR 219, no research investigator shall involve any human being as a subject in
              research unless the research investigator has obtained the legally effective informed con
              sent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Categories of
              exemption as defined above {32 CFR 219.101 paragraph (b)(1-6) and paragraph (e)} shall
              not be confused with minimal risk categories as defined at 32 CFR 219.117. IRB waiver
              of informed consent, as defined at 32 CFR 219.117, is not permitted within DoD (see Title
              10, USC 980). Human subjects research defined as "minimal risk" is permitted expedited
              review; however, informed consent shall not be waived.
              (3) This facility acknowledges and accepts its responsibilities for protecting the rights and
              welfare of human subjects of research covered by this policy.
              (4) This facility assures that before human subjects are involved in research covered by
              this policy, proper consideration will be given to:
                      (a) The risks to the subjects,

AF/SG Policy Governing Categorization of Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation
(RDT&E) Activities as “Human Research”

SUBJECT: Interim Policy Governing Categorization of Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation
(RDT&E) Activities as
References:      (a) AFI 40-402, Protection of Human Subjects in Biomedical and Behavioral Research
                 (b) DoDD 3216.2, Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in
                 DoD-Supported Research
                 (c) 32 CFR 219, Protection of Human Subjects
The Air Force Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) community has traditionally
acted outside the realm of “human research,” regulated by separate requirements, guidelines and over-
sight (e.g., AFI 91-202, Safety Investigations and Reports; AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investiga-
tions and Reports; AFI 63-101, Operations of Capabilities-Based Acquisition System; DoD Directive
5141.2, Director of Operational Test and Evaluation [DOT&E]). Recent guidance from DoD indicates
that, though many RDT&E activities are properly classified as non-research, some are considered “human
research” requiring AF/SG and human subjects protection oversight. Research is defined as a “systematic
investigation, including research, testing, development, and evaluation designed to develop or contribute
AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005                                                                                        79


towards generalizable knowledge.” (Ref. c) While all 2-letters are responsible for ensuring the compli-
ance of activities conducted under their purview, the AF Surgeon General has been delegated the authority
to oversee all human research conducted in the AF (both medical and non-medical) and the responsibility
to ensure the protection of human subjects. This policy applies to human research funded or conducted by
the USAF and provides guidance on categorizing RDT&E activities involving human subjects as either
non-research or as human research requiring oversight by the AF/SG and compliance with applicable
laws and regulations.
RDT&E activities involving human research could include the biological, behavioral, or psychological
study of a human or the effects of a test thereon, such as: test exposure to any agent (e.g., lasers, electro-
magnetic energy, solvents); deviation from normal daily regimens; and active manipulation of bodily pro-
cesses, behavior, or the environment in which human factors are measured.
It is surmised that the majority of AF RDT&E activities are non-research. Research and non-research may
employ similar investigative methods, but the latter is not intended to test a theory or to produce general-
izable knowledge. Examples of activities that are generally either not considered human research or that
are exempt from human research regulations (Refs a-c) include:
       a. “Exempt” activities meeting the requirements in 32 CFR 219.101(b), unless otherwise required
       by the USAF or local policy.
       b. Individual or group training of military personnel such as combat readiness, effectiveness,
       proficiency, or fitness exercises.
       c. Operational test and evaluation activities where the purpose of the tests is to make assessments
       regarding the attributes of a weapon, equipment, or munitions, including human/machine
       interfacing systems related thereto.
       d. Health readiness surveillance, such as activities carried out, under 10 U.S.C. 1074f (medical
       tracking system for members deployed overseas).
       e. Quality assurance, such as activities covered by 10 U.S.C. 1102 and DoD Directive 6025.13,
       "Medical Quality Assurance in the Military Health System," May 4, 2004.
       f. Evaluations of the success of established programs in achieving objectives or customer
       satisfaction surveys, when performed for use by program managers.
       g. Compliance Monitoring: Monitoring for compliance of individuals and organizations with
       requirements applicable to military, civilian, or contractor personnel or to organizational units.
       This includes such activities as drug testing, occupational health and safety monitoring, and
       security clearance reviews.
When considering whether to categorize an activity as non-research, it is crucial to be aware of certain
complicating factors. Activities obtaining data on the effects of any non-routine interaction with an indi-
vidual can be viewed as human research. Non-research activities may include components of research
activities that are subject to human subject protection regulations. Publication or presentation of results
can indicate intent to make knowledge generalizable, thus characterizing the activity as human research.
Complicating factors such as these make it essential that qualified, trained individuals review RDT&E
activities in order to determine whether human research is involved.
Each 2-letter shall designate an individual to serve as the organization’s Research Reviewer. The desig-
nated individual shall be sufficiently qualified through experience, expertise, and training to be able to
80                                                                               AFI40-402 5 MAY 2005


ascertain the acceptability of the proposed activity, while being sufficiently removed from the activity to
avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Research Reviewer shall be responsible for reviewing
the 2 letter’s activities with humans to determine whether human research is involved and, if so, whether
the activity can be classified as “Exempt” from References (a)-(c) as per 32 CFR 219.101. In questionable
cases, Research Reviewers shall seek the advice of an AF Institutional Review Board (IRB). All human
research activities determined by the Research Reviewer to be non-exempt must be submitted to and
approved by an appropriate IRB prior to initiation. Furthermore, the research must be conducted under an
assurance of compliance approved by AFMSA/SGRC. The Research Reviewer will maintain reports doc-
umenting their determinations. These reports shall summarize all activities reviewed, state whether they
were determined to involve human research, and reference which, if any, Exempt category (32 CFR
219.101) was applied. AFMSA/SGRC will be responsible for review of these reports. The Research
Reviewer will be subject to approval, training (See Attachment), and oversight by AFMSA/SGRC who,
until a Research Reviewer has been trained, shall perform the Research Reviewer’s function. Detailed
instructions on reviewing and reporting requirements shall be provided to designated Research Reviewers
by AFMSA/SGRC.
AF/SGR, under authority of the AF Surgeon General, may grant exceptions to this policy when deemed
appropriate in light of each 2 letter’s activities. This policy guidance is not intended to circumvent any
applicable code, law, regulation, directive, or instruction, but empowers the responsible organizations via
the Research Reviewer process to make independent determinations regarding the applicability of human
subjects protection regulations to ensure compliance therewith.
This policy supersedes all previous policy pertaining to this issue. Please direct questions to Col Peter
Demitry, Assistant Surgeon General, Modernization, DSN 761-7055.
