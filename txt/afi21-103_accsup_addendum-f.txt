This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all EC-130H ACC units. This Addendum does not apply to Air National Guard
(ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this document are maintained in accordance with
(IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and are disposed of IAW the Air Force

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Removes reference to Block 20 configured aircraft and associated subsystems. Adds Block
35/Baseline-1 unique subsystems and correct minor errors.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
2                                       AFI21-103_ACCSUP_ADDENDUM-F 12 APRIL 2010


Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable
(MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC
OMNIBUS Plan.
      1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
      degraded mission systems such as prime mission equipment.
      1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
      Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
      A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
      be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
      1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
      Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
      MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the
      unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
      1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
      code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL)
      across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
      applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft;
      therefore, it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL that are
      applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded
      aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to
      their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report
      status using only the FSL and TNG columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would
      determine and report status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded
      aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual
      aircraft assignment code.
         1.4.1. EC-130H unique mission codes:
EA--Electronic Attack-All Mission Types (Aircraft Systems)
LMB--Electronic Combat, Low-Mid Band (Block 30 Prime Mission Equipment)
HB--Electronic Combat, High Band (Block 30 Prime Mission Equipment)
SPR--Electronic Combat, SPecial Emitter ARray (SPEAR) (Block 30 Prime Msn Equipment)
EAC--Electronic Attack, Counter Communications Systems (Block 35 Prime Msn Equipment)
EAN--Electronic Attack, Counter Navigational Systems (Block 35 Prime Mission Equipment)
EAR--Electronic Attack, Counter Radar Systems (Block 35 Prime Mission Equipment)
