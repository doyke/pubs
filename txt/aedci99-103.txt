This instruction defines the duties of and organizational responsibilities related to AEDC Test
Representatives (TESTREPs) and Program Test and Evaluation Experts (PTEs) in supporting
Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation (T&E), as required by AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based
Test and Evaluation, and AFMCI 99-103, Test Management. Collaboration and early tester
involvement are the cornerstones to achieving Capabilities Based T&E. Integrated test teams
(ITTs) are key mechanisms to achieve collaboration and early involvement. Through ITTs,
AEDC TESTREPs and PTEs will assist Center Test Authorities (CTAs) and Program Managers
(PMs) in determining the levels and types of testing required and understanding the T&E
capabilities of AEDC. Additionally, AEDC TESTREPs and PTEs will be knowledgeable of
capability gaps or requirements and science and technology initiatives that may require T&E
investments and ensure appropriate inputs are provided in AEDC’s strategic planning and
resource allocation processes.

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 36-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm This instruction applies to all AEDC
government personnel providing T&E services. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT847,
Recommendation for Changes of Publication; route AF IMT 847 through the appropriate
functional chain of command.

This instruction applies to all T&E projects provided by AEDC to a reimbursable program.

       AFMC and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
       2.4.9. Support capability owners in providing inputs to the CARA process for near-term
       resource allocation, development of PPBE process submissions, and prioritization of
