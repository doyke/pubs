This instruction provides local procedures for managing and reporting limiting factors (LIMFACs); pol-
icy and procedures for implementing and using the Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP); and
policy for local Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) for In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP) chapter
functionals, as it pertains to the development of the McChord AFB IGESP. This instruction applies to all
units and tenant units assigned to McChord AFB. All units will maintain a current copy of this instruction.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accor-
dance with (IAW) Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.


1. General Information.
   1.1. This instruction implements the policy outlined in AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary
   Site Planning, and provides guidance for managing and reporting constraints/ limiting factors (LIM-
   FAC), the use of the Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP) and managing and conducting
   Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) for unit IGESP point of contacts (POCs).
   1.2. LIMFACs are constraints on personnel or material deficiencies, problems or conditions validated
   by the In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan Committee (IGESPC) that have a critical negative impact
   on the ability of a unit to perform its wartime mission and require the aid of higher headquarters to
   resolve.
   1.3. Constraints that do not meet IGESP LIMFAC criteria are items or limitations that have a critical
   negative effect on the base’s war fighting capability; however, they can be resolved at the unit level.

    1.4. The use of the STEP is mandatory for developing the IGESP. The STEP partially automates the
    overall expeditionary site planning process and standardizes IGESP products via a sophisticated, mul-
    timedia tool for the collection of site data.
    1.5. To provide for a hands-on-approach to the IGESP program, the Logistics Plans (62 LRS/
    LGRRP) section will conduct an annual SAV for each unit POC.
    1.6. To ensure each unit within the 446th Airlift Wing is aware of how their chapter of the IGESP is
    developed. The Logistics Plans section will work closely with 446 LRF/LGRR and the 446 AW point
    of contact in soliciting/receiving data for the STEP input.

2. Reporting Constraints.
    2.1. During development or review of the IGESP, each unit will compare capabilities against contin-
    gency requirements and identify all constraints. These constraints will be reviewed by the unit com-
    mander and submitted to the Logistics Plans Flight for review by the IGESPC.
    2.2. Using the format (see Attachment 2), use a tracking number unique to your organization. For
    example, 62 LRS would use LRS0107 for its first reported constraint in 2007. Also, fully explain the
    unit’s actions taken to resolve the constraint and enter the estimated completion date (ECD) for con-
    straint resolution.
NOTE: LIMFACs are always classified.
    2.3. Ensure that constraint/LIMFAC communications are properly labeled for classified documents
    IAW DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/
    520001r.pdf for guidance.
    2.4. The Logistics Plans Flight will schedule an IGESPC constraint validation meeting to determine
    if constraint meets IGESP LIMFAC criteria.
    2.5. If the constraint is identified as a limiting factor by the IGESPC then the logistics plans office
    will forward the LIMFAC to Headquarters Air Mobility Command, Logistics Plans Division (HQ
    AMC/A4XX). The reporting unit will update the IGESP in STEP.
    2.6. Constraints that do not meet IGESP LIMFAC criteria, should be identified as such (e.g., con-
    straint, shortfall, etc.) and included in the IGESP using STEP.
    2.7. Managing LIMFACs.
       2.7.1. Units will monitor reported LIMFACs and submit updates should changes occur (e.g.,
       LIMFAC becomes invalid, outdated, etc.).
       2.7.2. The Logistic Plans Flight will track outstanding LIMFAC/s for ECD and notify the mem-
       bers of the In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan when the status of a LIMFAC changes.

3. Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP) Policy and Procedures.
    3.1. For maximum flexibility, the STEP program will be available to each chapter OPR either on their
    unit computer or at the Logistics Plans Flight, located in building 576.
    3.2. Training for the STEP is provided on just-in-time basis as the unit POC is updating their STEP
    data or upon request.

4. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) Policy.
   4.1. The Logistic Plans Flight will:
       4.1.1. Maintain a staff assistance visit (SAV) program for all unit POCs.
       4.1.2. Publish a SAV schedule no later than 15 November, for the following calendar year, visiting
       each unit once every 12 months.
       4.1.3. Provide each measured unit with the SAV checklist at least 1 month prior to schedule to
       visit, or as checklist is revised.
       4.1.4. Submit SAV results for each unit to squadron commander and briefed at the next In-Garri-
       son Expeditionary Site Plan Committee meeting.
   4.2. Unit IGESP Chapter OPRs will maintain a continuity book to ensure succeeding personnel are
   aware of how the chapter was developed. Include any internal checklist, formulas for data entered into
   IGESP, etc. AFI 10-404, paragraph 2.9.6 stipulates the contents of the continuity book, see Attach-
   ment 3 for unit POC IGESP Continuity Book Table of Contents.
