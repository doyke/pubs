                         CDA LIFE CYCLE AND MANAGEMENT

1.1. Overview. The CDA life cycle begins with the planning phase and extends through audit
reporting. The audit control point (ACP) consists of the audit manager (AM), program manager
(PM), and associate director (AD). This chapter provides general background information on the
CDA process.
1.2. CDA Process. AFAA uses an audit process designed to make the most efficient and
effective use of audit resources. First, substantial planning is employed to identify and research
potential CDA subjects (reference AFAAI 65-103, Audit Management and Administration,
Chapter 10). The planning phase encompasses all actions needed to define audit objectives and
thoroughly plan the audit. The planning phase culminates with development of the Centrally
Directed Audit Program (CDAP). The CDAP provides the analytical methodology for a
thorough examination designed to disclose deficiencies and their underlying causes and effects.
During the application phase, auditors gather adequate evidence to support audit results and
provide a basis for specific recommendations. Finally, the ACP prepares the audit report to
clearly communicate identified audit results, management corrective actions taken, and/or
recommendations to correct noted deficiencies. Follow-up audits determine whether actions
taken by management corrected cited deficiencies. Note: Specific information on audit
milestones and phases can be found in the AFAA MIS Desk Reference.
   1.2.1. Planning. Audit topics, as summarized in the AFAA Fiscal Year Audit Plan, are
   identified by directorates in partnership with Air Force decision makers to address significant
   areas of management concerns. The CDA project life cycle begins when the ACP issues the
   planning announcement memorandum and begins research. This phase ends when the ACP
   distributes the CDAP.
       1.2.1.1. Research. During audit research, AMs acquire background information needed
       to design the audit; review internal controls and form a preliminary assessment of their
       effectiveness; assess the risk of fraud; identify potential findings (identified as
       ―exceptions‖ or ―issues‖ within TeamMate) and their probable causes; and determine the
       need for a full audit. Based on research results, the ACP either recommends undertaking
       a full audit, issuing an audit report (after obtaining sufficient, appropriate evidence), or
       discontinuing the audit. This decision is generally made when the ACP presents their
       recommendations to the assistant auditor general (AAG) at a ―go/no go‖ briefing.
       1.2.1.2. Design. Audit design begins when the ACP completes research and, with
       approval of the AAG, decides to initiate a full audit. The ACP identifies and limits the
       audit objectives to those fulfilling the audit purpose, issues the audit announcement
       memorandum, and develops audit steps to fully document and substantiate the potential
       findings (and associated cause/effect) identified during research. The AM then develops
       and distributes the CDAP.
   1.2.2. Application. Audit application includes data gathering, summarization and analysis,
   validation, draft report writing, and sending the report out for comment. Application begins
   when area audit offices (AAOs), and/or the AM, start applying the CDAP and ends when
   management comments are received.
 6                                                                   AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


        1.2.2.1. Data gathering includes all field work AAO personnel and/or the AM perform to
        gather evidence supporting the audit objectives and potential findings.
        1.2.2.2. Summarization and analysis includes compiling and evaluating audit results and
        drawing conclusions.
        1.2.2.3. Validation is the discussion of audit results and potential findings with
        management during the audit. Management either agrees with (validates) the audit
        results or disagrees and provides evidence supporting their opposing position. Additional
        audit testing may be necessary to obtain further support for the audit results or to examine
        new evidence presented by management.
        1.2.2.4. The draft report portion of the application phase includes drafting the Air Force
        report of audit, reviewing the draft report, referencing the report, discussing the report
        with management, receiving AAG approval to release the draft report, and distributing
        the report for comment.
     1.2.3. Report Processing. The report processing phase begins when the ACP receives
     management comments and ends with final report distribution. This phase includes
     evaluating management comments, obtaining final coordination on the comments, preparing
     the final report package, obtaining AAG final report approval; and publishing and
     distributing the final report.
1.3. CDA Management Responsibilities. The following paragraphs provide general
responsibilities for conducting CDAs. AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 4, provides additional policies
and procedures guiding relationships between the ACP and AAOs.
     1.3.1. AAG Responsibilities.
        1.3.1.1. Coordinate and approve the directorate annual audit plan. To begin audit
        subjects not included in the annual plan, AAGs must request (through HQ
        AFAA/DO) SAF/AG approval using the ―Substitutes of CDAs in Plan‖ their weekly
        status report. The AAG should also complete and include the ―Unplanned Audit
        Subjects‖ template located on the AFAA Home Community of Practice (CoP) to
        request project approval.
        1.3.1.2. Approve end-of-research decisions (i.e., go/no-go decisions) to conduct a full
        audit, issue a draft report without undertaking a full audit, or discontinue the project.
        1.3.1.3. Monitor CDA progress and performance.
        1.3.1.4. Promptly act on identified problems (such as access denials by management) and
        requests for deviation from established CDA project milestones, resources, or objectives.
        1.3.1.5. Review and approve draft audit reports for release to management and
        evaluations of management comments.
        1.3.1.6. Coordinate with HQ AFAA/DO to determine the appropriate course of action
        when management comments are not received within 75 days after the draft report was
        released for management comments.
     1.3.2. Associate Director Responsibilities. ADs are the second-level supervisors for CDA
     projects and will.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                        7


     1.3.2.1. Maintain contact with HQ USAF and major command (MAJCOM) customers,
     develop audit issues and plans, and approve planning starts (for audit subjects included in
     the annual plan).
     1.3.2.2. Provide PMs and AMs with guidance and direction.
     1.3.2.3. Review audit objectives and plans, and monitor application activities to verify
     achievement of audit objectives.
     1.3.2.4. Act on identified problems (e.g., access denial or disagreements with AAO
     personnel). Initiate or evaluate requests for deviation from established CDA project
     milestones, resources, or objectives.
     1.3.2.5. Review audit results and, as needed, participate in management discussions.
     1.3.2.6. Review and approve draft audit reports for AAG review, and ensure draft reports
     are independently referenced with all comments cleared prior to release for comments.
     1.3.2.7. Review and approve the evaluation of management comments before AAG
     review.
     1.3.2.8. Review audit working papers in accordance with directorate policy using the
     ―Working Paper Review Checklist‖ on the AFAA Home CoP or a similar locally-
     developed checklist. If the directorate does not specify a policy, the minimum
     requirement is for the AD to document a thorough review covering all phases of a
     completed project for one set of working papers per branch annually. Note: The AD will
     not hyperlink the checklist to the working papers, since AD reviews are generally
     conducted after the projects have been archived. Instead, the AD should provide enough
     information in the checklist to allow a third party to understand the actions taken and
     issues noted during the review.
        1.3.2.8.1. After completing the working paper review, the AD will discuss the review
        results with the AM and PM.
        1.3.2.8.2. The AD will maintain a file of completed working paper review checklists
        for ready reference.
  1.3.3. Program Manager Responsibilities. The PM is the first-level supervisor for CDA
  projects and will:
     1.3.3.1. Be familiar with their assigned areas of responsibility, perform and document
     issue identification and subject research in assigned areas, and assist in developing annual
     audit plans.
     1.3.3.2. Provide AMs with project assignments, guidance, technical assistance, and
     training.
     1.3.3.3. Ensure AMs conduct all audit phases in accordance with government auditing
     standards and AFAA policies and procedures.
     1.3.3.4. Review project working papers as the audit progresses and document review
     results using TeamMate coaching notes.
     1.3.3.5. Assist AMs in conducting planning-phase research, evaluating planning-phase
     results, and preparing the go/no-go briefing.
8                                                                  AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


       1.3.3.6. Assist the AM in designing the audit.
       1.3.3.7. Review and approve the CDAP.
       1.3.3.8. Review summarized audit results and participate in management discussions.
       1.3.3.9. Review and approve draft reports and the evaluation of management comments.
       1.3.3.10. Ensure required quality assurance procedures (e.g., supervisory review and
       independent referencing) are accomplished in accordance with AFAAI 65-105, Internal
       Quality Control Program.
    1.3.4. Audit Manager Responsibilities. The AM is responsible for direct management of
    assigned CDA projects and will:
       1.3.4.1. Conduct audit projects in accordance with government auditing standards and
       AFAA policies and procedures.
       1.3.4.2. Document all work performed and evidence gathered in project working paper
       files prepared in accordance with paragraph 3.3 and AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6 and
       Attachment 7.
       1.3.4.3. Develop research plans, perform planning work, evaluate planning results,
       formulate audit objectives, and prepare the CDAP.
       1.3.4.4. Monitor application-site audit activities, and schedule audit conferences and site
       visits as needed to help field auditors understand and accomplish audit objectives.
       Provide technical assistance to AAO personnel during application.
       1.3.4.5. Resolve or elevate problems that may arise during application (such as denial of
       access to pertinent records; disagreements with AAO personnel; and the potential need to
       deviate from established CDA milestones, resources, or objectives). For information
       access problems, reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 18.
       1.3.4.6. Summarize audit results, identify report issues, and discuss (validate) results
       with management.
       1.3.4.7. Prepare the draft audit report and discuss the report with management.

    1.3.5. HQ AFAA/DOO Responsibilities.
       1.3.5.1. Review draft Air Force-level audit reports, PMB computations, and the
       Summary of Audit Results (SAR) statement and provide advisory comments to AAGs
       and SAF/AG.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                      9


       1.3.5.2. Collect, track, and analyze overall project management data (reference
       paragraph 1.3.6.5).
   1.3.6. SAF/AGA Responsibilities.
       1.3.6.1. Release draft reports to HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, and DoD and monitor receipt of
       management comments from the office of primary responsibility (OPR).
       1.3.6.2. Coordinate with the OPR and the ACP on requests to extend the due date for
       management comments.
       1.3.6.3. Provide cold-reader critique of management comment’s responsiveness.
       1.3.6.4. Obtain SAF/AG approval of the evaluation of management comments.
       1.3.6.5. Provide project management data to HQ AFAA/DOO for tracking purposes.
   1.3.7. HQ AFAA/DOV Responsibilities. HQ AFAA/DOV will update TeamMate and non-
   TeamMate templates as changes are identified.
1.4. CDA Project Management.
   1.4.1. Project Planning. AFAA developed the AFAA MIS to plan and manage individual
   CDA projects (i.e., allocate audit resources and track project completion). The Project Plan
   Report is the primary AFAA MIS product personnel use to manage CDA projects. HQ
   AFAA/DOO initiates project creation in the AFAA MIS for audit subjects included in the
   annual plan. Throughout the audit, the ACP reviews and updates the AFAA MIS to reflect
   actual or revised milestone completion dates and monitor resource utilization.
       1.4.1.1. Planning Phase. The ACP enters planning-phase milestones, locations, and
       hours in the AFAA MIS at the start of each audit and submits the AFAA MIS Project
       Plan Report with the planning announcement memorandum to internal addressees.
       Planning-phase milestones are tentative commitments and may be changed with approval
       of the appropriate AD.
       1.4.1.2. Application Phase. The ACP enters application-phase milestones, locations, and
       hours in the AFAA MIS and submits the updated Project Plan Report with the audit
       announcement memorandum to internal addressees. Application-phase milestones are
       firm commitments and may not be changed without approval of the appropriate AAG.
   1.4.2. Substituting Bases. Region chiefs may request that certain bases be omitted from
   CDA application and will recommend replacement bases whenever possible. If the ACP
   concurs with the region chief’s recommendation, the ACP will make the change and update
   the AFAA MIS. If the ACP does not concur and cannot come to an agreement with the
   region chief, the AD will elevate the matter to the AAG for a final decision.
   1.4.3. Cancellations. When announced audits are subsequently cancelled, the ACP will
   prepare a notification memorandum stating the reasons for the cancellation. The ACP will
   send the memorandum to each audit participant and each addressee of the original
   announcement memorandum.
1.5. Timely CDA Completion. The timely completion of audits provides an essential service to
management and meets the audit standard for timely reporting. Toward this end, AFAA
established certain thresholds (discussed below) considered critical to timely CDA completion.
 10                                                               AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


The CDA team will carefully review AFAA MIS data to identify projects approaching or
exceeding these thresholds. When the ACP first determines a project will exceed a threshold, the
team will brief the AAG. In turn, the AAG will provide all relevant details to SAF/AG during
the next weekly status briefing. Thus, SAF/AG can make timely resource investment decisions.
Note: HQ AFAA/DO distributes a threshold report monthly (paragraph 1.5.5); however, the
ACP should be proactive in the identification and reporting of projects that are likely to breach
milestones.
   1.5.1. Audit Planning. The ACP exceeds this threshold when the start of planning to the end
   of audit design exceeds 6 months. Additionally, the team exceeds this threshold when audit
   planning exceeds 1,200 total staff hours.
   1.5.2. Fieldwork and Summarization. The ACP exceeds this threshold when data gathering,
   summarization and analysis, and validation exceeds 6 months (original plan, revised plan, or
   actual).
   1.5.3. Draft to Management. The ACP exceeds this threshold when 4 or more months have
   elapsed since summarization ended and the directorate has not issued management a draft
   report. To assist in meeting this objective and minimize the time spent preparing the draft
   report:
       1.5.3.1. Supervisors should generally not schedule AMs for training during draft report
       writing. Note: If the AM is unavailable for an extended period, the PM should be
       prepared to continue with draft report preparation in the AM’s absence.
       1.5.3.2. Unless personal hardships are involved, AMs should not schedule significant
       amounts of leave during draft report writing.
       1.5.3.3. The PM and AD should work their schedules to ensure timely draft report
       processing. Note: If the PM or AD are unavailable for an extended period (e.g., on leave
       or temporary duty), the report should be passed to the next level in the review chain.
   1.5.4. Planned Hours Overrun. The ACP exceeds this threshold when a project exceeds
   planned hours by 25 percent or more. This applies when either actual hours or revised hours
   (actual hours to date and additional hours needed to complete the project) exceed the original
   planned hours by 25 percent or more.
   1.5.5. Notification. HQ AFAA/DOO will provide the appropriate AAG an advance notice
   when a project approaches any established threshold. Additionally, HQ AFAA/DO will
   notify the AAG and SAF/AG when a project exceeds a threshold.
1.6. Audit Working Papers. The AM will prepare working papers for each project in standard
AFAA format following the guidance in paragraph 3.3 and AFAAI 65103, Chapter 6 and
Attachment 7. AMs will start each audit using the latest TeamMate Library available on the
AFAA Home CoP for CDA-level audits. All working papers, templates, toolkits, and other files
mentioned within this instruction are available through the AFAA Home CoP and the ―102
Reference Locator‖.
1.7. Exception Report. The TeamMate Exception Report is a tool for the ACP to use in
reaching consensus on the essential attributes of each audit result. The goal is to obtain early
agreement on finding attributes, thus reducing report writing and processing time. Each
directorate will develop its own policy for using the exception report.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                  11


  1.7.1. Validation and Discussion. The AM should generate an exception report at the end of
  research and incorporate the information in the CDAP (paragraph 2.6.4.4). The AM can also
  use the exception report during validation discussions; however, the document should be
  appropriately marked as a draft for discussion purposes only.
  1.7.2. Retention. The AM should retain the final, approved exception report in the working
  papers.
 12                                                              AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


                                         Chapter 2

                                    PLANNING PHASE

2.1. Overview. The main purpose of the planning phase is to obtain all the information needed
to support expending audit resources, determine the audit scope and objectives, and develop a
plan (the CDAP) for subsequent in-depth audit work. This chapter provides guidance for
conducting the CDA planning phase. The TeamMate CDA Library contains the CDA Planning
Program, which provides additional guidance for conducting the CDA planning phase.
Section A—Research
2.2. Preliminary Research.
   2.2.1. Project Assignments. AMs may be assigned projects for which prior research was
   accomplished, usually as a basis for including the subject in the annual plan (see AFAAI 65-
   103, Chapter 10). When assigning the audit, the PM should provide the AM all preliminary
   research documentation.
   2.2.2. Time Reporting. HQ AFAA/DOO assigns a project number to each audit topic
   included in the AFAA Fiscal Year Audit Plan. Accordingly, the time associated with
   conducting preliminary research on a topic should be charged to the assigned project number.
   Preliminary research hours can be charged to Milestone 1.0. Although the days associated
   with Milestone 1.0 are not included in the AFAA expended days analysis (measured from
   Milestone 1.1), the hours expended during Milestone 1.0 are included in the overall project
   hours. Note: Subject identification and other planning work not associated with a specific
   topic in the audit plan should be charged to AFAA MIS Code 9999835, CDA Annual Plan
   Preparation.
2.3. Research Activities and Responsibilities.
   2.3.1. Project Plan Report. The ACP will populate the AFAA MIS Project Plan Report to
   include audit milestones (planned start and finish dates), application sites (when known),
   planned hours, and other required project data.
   2.3.2. Independence Statement. The annual independence statement template is available on
   the AFAA Home CoP. All audit management team members (AM, PM, AD, AAG, deputy
   AAG, AG, deputy AG, independent referencer, and technical experts) will sign an annual
   independence statement before the start of each fiscal year. The AM is responsible for
   ensuring a copy of each audit management team member’s independence statement is filed in
   the project file. For additional independence statement guidance, see AFAAI 65-103,
   Chapter 8.
   2.3.3. Planning Announcement Memorandum. The AM will prepare a memorandum
   announcing the planning phase of each new project. The AD (for audit subjects in the annual
   plan) or the AAG (for audit subjects not in the annual plan) will sign the planning
   announcement memorandum.
       2.3.3.1. General Requirements. The planning announcement memorandum should
       disclose the intent to formulate specific audit subobjectives and known and potential
       research sites, and include a request for management to provide general management
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                          13


     topics and potential audit issues. Also, the planning announcement memorandum should
     state whether the audit was included in the AFAA Fiscal Year Audit Plan. If not, the
     memorandum should explain the need for the audit (e.g., management request, change in
     priorities).
         2.3.3.1.1. For request audits, identify the requester’s title in the objectives paragraph.
         2.3.3.1.2. For financial audits, include a stated objective to evaluate the internal
         control structure applicable to the subject area.
         2.3.3.1.3. For follow-up audits, if the original audit contained PMB, include an
         objective in the current audit to validate the PMB.
     2.3.3.2. Internal Distribution Procedures. E-mail copies of the planning announcement
     memorandum to SAF/AGA, HQ AFAA/DOO, the other directorates, and AAOs and
     regions corresponding to locations the AM plans to visit. Include the Project Plan Report
     with the planning memorandum.
     2.3.3.3. External Distribution.      Attachment 2 identifies external distribution
     requirements. For external addressees, do not include the Project Plan Report. The
     Project Plan Report is an internal AFAA document and will not be distributed outside the
     Agency.
         2.3.3.3.1. HQ USAF. SAF/AGA will distribute copies to applicable HQ USAF
         offices and the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Defense (DoD OIG).
         2.3.3.3.2. MAJCOMs. The ACP will distribute the planning announcement
         memorandum to the audit focal points and gatekeepers of the MAJCOMs responsible
         for the units to be visited. Email addresses for the MAJCOM focal points and
         gatekeepers are on the AFAA Home CoP.
     2.3.3.4. Management Responses.       In response to the planning announcement
     memorandum, management may provide specific areas of concern or changes impacting
     the subject. In this instance, the AM should reply to management with a response
     (memorandum or email) acknowledging their input and indicating what actions will be
     taken.
  2.3.4. Research Plan. The AM will prepare a plan that identifies the research objectives,
  work required to accomplish those objectives, and where the research work will be
  accomplished. The PM will assist the AM in developing the research plan and approve the
  final plan. Note: The research plan is not a static document and should be updated during
  research as additional information is obtained. The research plan should make a good
  starting point for developing the audit program.
     2.3.4.1. Regular Audits. The CDA Planning Program contains the following minimum
     research steps for regular audits:
         2.3.4.1.1. Background Information. Identify terminology and acronyms unique to
         the audit activity; mission descriptions; offices of primary and collateral
         responsibility; regulatory and statutory requirements; and magnitude data (numbers of
         people, transactions, facilities, and equipment assets; dollar value of assets,
         transactions, and contracts; and annual obligations or expenditures).
14                                                            AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


     2.3.4.1.2. Internal Controls. Government auditing standards and AFAA policies and
     procedures require auditors to review and evaluate internal controls deemed
     significant within the context of the audit objectives. The purpose is to determine if
     established controls (a) are working as intended and (b) provide reasonable assurance
     of detecting or preventing errors, irregularities, inefficiencies, or uneconomical
     practices. As such, the AM will identify significant internal controls management
     established to safeguard assets; assure compliance with laws and regulations; and
     promote effective, economical program operations. When controls are significant to
     the audit, accomplish a preliminary internal control assessment during the planning
     phase. This step is normally accomplished through review of regulations and
     operating instruction, discussions with managers and operating personnel, physical
     inspection, testing, review of internal control reports (assessments performed to meet
     the requirements of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act), and reviews of
     prior audit reports. The five standards for internal controls as outlined in Office of
     Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for
     Internal Control, and GAO-01-1008G, Internal Control Management and Evaluation
     Tool, are control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
     communication, and monitoring. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 7, for additional
     details on internal controls.
     2.3.4.1.3. Processes and Procedures. Identify current managerial and operational
     processes in the audit area and major initiatives, ongoing or planned, that will affect
     the current processes.
     2.3.4.1.4. Systems and Forms. Identify applicable system reports/products and
     forms. Also, identify reporting requirements and the specifics on information needed
     to support the audit objectives.
     2.3.4.1.5. Metrics. Identify the performance parameters senior Air Force, MAJCOM,
     and base officials use to measure managerial effectiveness in the area under review.
     Success in achieving the established metrics is a prime indicator of the organization’s
     effectiveness. Through discussion with management officials, determine what
     measures or indicators they use, if any, to measure how well the audited activity is
     accomplishing its mission. If management has established metrics for the audited
     activity, obtain and review the latest data/reports. Note: Consider including steps in
     the audit program to determine the validity of the metrics (i.e. determine if the metrics
     were computed correctly and reported accurately). If no metrics exist, determine if
     management should have indicators to measure productivity, service, or mission
     effectiveness.
     2.3.4.1.6. Management Input. Obtain management’s perspective on the value of the
     audit; feedback on tentative objectives, scope, and audit approach; and management’s
     recommendations (if any) regarding the audit scope and objectives.
     2.3.4.1.7. Risk of Fraud. Identify any potential areas of fraud. Identify conditions
     that could indicate fraud, especially when auditing areas with high potential for
     errors, irregularities, and illegal acts (areas involving cash, valuable and or highly
     pilferable assets, labor costs, billing systems and related reviews, indirect costs, in
     theatre operations, travel, payroll, worker’s compensation, asset misappropriation,
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                      15


        base allowance for housing, retail operations, contractual issues, etc.). The amount of
        effort expended should be commensurate with the materiality and risk associated with
        the subject matter. Based on the planning work accomplished, assess the risk (low,
        medium, or high) for fraud and document your assessment. If control problems are
        noted (e.g., non-compliance and lack of oversight) and the audit area has high
        potential for fraud, consider the risk of fraud to be high. If the risk of fraud is
        assessed as medium or high, include steps in the audit program to provide reasonable
        assurance of detecting fraud or illegal acts. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 8, for
        additional information on fraud as it relates to financial and performance audits.
        2.3.4.1.8. Prior Audits. Identify AFAA, DoD OIG, Government Accountability
        Office (GAO), or public accounting firm (may be applicable to non-appropriated fund
        or financial audits) audits accomplished within the last 5 years with objectives similar
        to the current audit (if any). Division research files, the AFAA Home CoP, AFAA
        MIS Web Reports, the Internet, and DAMIS Corporate View are valuable sources for
        identifying prior audit coverage. Government auditing standards require auditors
        follow up and report in the current report on prior audit results and recommendations
        addressed to the same management level and corresponding to the objectives of the
        current audit.
        2.3.4.1.9. Sampling Methods. Evaluate opportunities to use statistical sampling or
        computer assisted auditing tools and techniques (CAATTs). Reference AFAAI
        65103, Chapter 11.
        2.3.4.1.10. Computer-Processed Data. Identify potential sources of data and reports
        that will be relied on to accomplish the audit objectives and support the audit
        conclusions.. The AM should make a preliminary assessment of data reliability and
        include steps in the CDAP to verify the validity and reliability of computer-processed
        data if the data will be used to accomplish the audit objectives and support the audit
        conclusions.
        2.3.4.1.11. Audit Risk. Audit risk is the possibility that the AM’s findings,
        conclusions, recommendations, or assurance may be improper or incomplete, as a
        result of factors such as evidence that is not sufficient and/or appropriate, an
        inadequate audit process, or intentional omissions or misleading information due to
        misrepresentations or fraud. Audit risk should be addressed and assessed throughout
        the planning process and appropriate actions should be taken to reduce audit risk to an
        acceptable level. Within the context of audit risk, exercising professional judgment in
        determining the sufficiency and appropriateness of evidence used to support findings,
        conclusions, and recommendations is an integral part of the audit process. Reference
        AFAAI 65-103, Chapters 7 and 8 for additional information on audit risk.
        2.3.4.1.12. Site Visits. The AM will visit applicable HQ USAF offices and a
        representative sample of MAJCOMs and bases to identify potential audit issues. To
        the extent possible, the PM will accompany the AM on visits to HQ USAF and
        MAJCOMs. The PM may also accompany the AM (particularly less experienced
        AMs) on other planning-phase research trips when deemed appropriate. The AM
        will:
           2.3.4.1.12.1. Notify SAF/AGA of visits to HQ USAF elements and contact
16                                                                AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


            AAOs and AFAA MAJCOM representatives before visiting bases and commands.
            Note: Include Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and ANG components in the
            planning phase whenever the subject warrants. These components are vital
            elements of the total Air Force policy and should receive appropriate audit
            research and coverage. When visiting ANG units, follow guidance in the Quick
            Reference Guide for Auditing Within Air National Guard Units located on the
            AFAA Home CoP.
            2.3.4.1.12.2. Document the results of all in-briefings, meetings, and discussions
            in a related procedure step.
            2.3.4.1.12.3. Select a small sample of transactions for each potential objective
            and follow each sample transaction through the entire process.
            2.3.4.1.12.4. Identify potential findings; try to determine probable causes (e.g.,
            inadequate guidance, oversight, performance measures, or training); assess effect
            (impact on mission or resources); and formulate potential recommendations.
            Also, identify ―best practices‖ when positive conditions exist.
            2.3.4.1.12.5. Be alert to illegal (fraudulent) or abusive situations and transactions.
         2.3.4.1.13. Findings. Perform sufficient, appropriate tests to identify potentially
         significant problems and their probable causes and effect.
         2.3.4.1.14. Complete the research plan and document all work performed in proper
         TeamMate procedure step format. Cross reference each research procedure step to
         associated supporting documentation so the PM can readily review the responses and
         outcome for each research step.
     2.3.4.2. Follow-up Audits. The planning phase requirements for a follow-up audit are
     much different from a regular audit. For a follow-up audit, the original audit constitutes
     the research, and there is no need to develop a plan to guide the research effort. AMs will
     obtain and review the original audit’s working papers, become familiar with the subject
     area, and identify any regulatory changes occurring since the original audit. This can be
     accomplished during preliminary research or audit program design.
  2.3.5. Working Papers. The AM will gather sufficient, appropriate evidence during research
  to support the ―go‖ or ―nogo‖ audit decision, determine the audit scope and objectives, and
  design the audit. Document all planning work accomplished in the Go/No-Go Briefing
  procedure step meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.3 and AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6 and
  Attachment 7.
     2.3.5.1. Working Paper Contents. At a minimum, the AM should include the following
     in research working papers:
         2.3.5.1.1. Copies of all preliminary research working papers prepared to support
         inclusion of the subject in the annual plan (if any).
         2.3.5.1.2. Audit planning announcement memorandum and management responses.
         2.3.5.1.3. The research portion of the CDA Planning Program cross referenced to
         each step’s detail support.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                        17


         2.3.5.1.4. The laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, standards, measures,
         expected performance, defined business practices, and benchmarks against which
         performance is compared or evaluated (i.e., the criteria). Note: Criteria identify the
         required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation.
         Criteria provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding the findings.
         2.3.5.1.5. Procedure steps documenting           in-briefings,   other   planning-phase
         discussions, and audit test results.
         2.3.5.1.6. Go/No-Go Briefing that clearly documents the audit ―go‖ or ―nogo‖
         decision and includes potential findings and recommendations (this information can
         be obtained from the TeamMate Exception Report). It is acceptable for the AM to
         use the go/no-go briefing as the research summary. The AM will cross reference the
         go/no-go briefing or the research summary (if used) to the supporting TeamMate
         procedure steps and associated supporting working papers.
     2.3.5.2. Working Paper Reviews. The PM will review the AM’s working papers as the
     planning phase progresses and document the reviews using TeamMate coaching notes.
     The PM will:
         2.3.5.2.1. Review and sign-off on all procedure steps and working papers prior to the
         go/no-go briefing.
         2.3.5.2.2. Ensure the AM reviews and clears the TeamMate coaching notes prior to
         the go/no-go briefing.
  2.3.6. Application SiteSelection. The AM, with the assistance of the PM and AD, will select
  potential application locations and justify the sites selected to the AAG at the go/no-go
  briefing. The AM should first determine whether the audit subject permits any flexibility in
  selecting the audit application sites.
     2.3.6.1. Specific Location Audits. Little site flexibility exists if the subject matter is
     specific to a particular MAJCOM, systems center, or logistics center. AMs who have
     little or no flexibility in selecting audit application sites should contact the applicable
     AAO chiefs to schedule the required sites. If an application site is already fully
     committed to other work, the region chief should either detail additional audit personnel
     to that location or elevate the issue to the AAG for workload prioritization.
     2.3.6.2. Flexible Location Audits. AMs have site flexibility when they can apply the
     audit at any Air Force location. AMs with site flexibility should:
         2.3.6.2.1. Statistical Selection. Select application sites statistically if the ACP plans
         to project the application results to the universe of Air Force entities. In coordination
         with AFAA statisticians, AMs who select application sites based on a statistical
         sample should select 25 percent additional sites to be used as alternates. The
         alternates may be used in the event a selected site in the primary sample cannot be
         used due to higher priority work. Replacement sites should be made in the random
         order selected.
         2.3.6.2.2. Non-Statistical Selection. To the extent possible, choose locations with
         lower CDA workloads and avoid locations with more than 60 percent CDA workload.
         Whenever possible, select AAOs that specifically request application at their location
18                                                                AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


         and a representative mix of satellite locations in addition to locations permanently
         staffed with auditors. The AFAA Home CoP identifies each location’s percentage of
         overall CDA work.
     2.3.6.3. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Include AFRC and ANG units
     whenever the subject warrants. However, try to avoid selecting ANG units for audit that
     were recently reviewed by the National Guard Bureau–Internal Review (NGB-IR) staff
     on a similar objective. Coordinate with applicable AAOs when selecting ANG units for
     CDA application.
     2.3.6.4. Number of Application Sites. In general, the AM should use the following
     guidelines for selecting the number of application sites:
         2.3.6.4.1. Statistical Sampling – Select 16-20 sites, but no less than 12.
         2.3.6.4.2. Non-Statistical Sampling – Select 5-7 sites, but no more than 12.
     2.3.6.5. Site Sourcing. After selecting tentative application sites, AMs should
     contact the applicable AAO chief to schedule the selected sites. Note: When
     selecting application sites using retrieved data (e.g. transactions, personnel data
     codes, etc), be cognizant that one location can represent many organizations, which
     can result in using more local resources than intended.
  2.3.7. Go/No-Go Briefing. The AM, with the assistance of the PM and AD, will prepare and
  deliver a go/no-go briefing to the AAG before proceeding to the audit application phase. The
  purpose of the briefing is to justify the audit need, describe the audit approach, and obtain
  AAG approval to expend the resources needed to complete the audit and write the report.
  Note: The AAG may waive the go/no-go briefing requirement. Further, a go/no-go briefing
  is not normally required for follow-up audits.
     2.3.7.1. Each individual AAG determines the content of the go/no-go briefing.
     However, the AM and PM should be prepared to discuss the following topics:
         2.3.7.1.1. Background Information. Provide sufficient detail to enable the AAG to
         understand the program, system, or function.
         2.3.7.1.2. Management Contacts. Identify the level of management officials
         contacted during research; their opinion on the value of the audit; and their
         suggestions related to the audit scope, if any.
         2.3.7.1.3. Control Environment.        Provide a preliminary assessment of the
         effectiveness of established controls.
         2.3.7.1.4. Computer-Processed Data. Identify the computer-processed data that will
         be used to support audit conclusions and describe how the AM plans to test the data’s
         reliability.
         2.3.7.1.5. Prior Audits. Identify previous audits and attestation engagements with
         similar objectives, if any, and advise if it will be necessary to conduct audit tests
         during the current audit to follow up on the prior audit results.
         2.3.7.1.6. Research Results. Identify potential findings: condition, cause, effect, and
         criteria. Include a discussion of PMB.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                        19


          2.3.7.1.7. Audit Risk Assessment. Discuss any special circumstances that may affect
          the audit (reference paragraph 2.3.4.1.11.).
          2.3.7.1.8. Fraud Assessment. Outline the preliminary fraud assessment based on your
          planning work (high, medium, or low). For high and medium fraud assessments,
          discuss planned audit steps to address reasonable assurance of detecting fraud or
          illegal acts.
          2.3.7.1.9. Audit Approach. Discuss the audit objectives and audit tests the AM will
          use to answer each objective. Include plans to use statistical sampling, CAATTs, or
          other auditing tools.
          2.3.7.1.10. Assistant Audit Managers. If applicable, discuss plans to use key
          journeyman auditors as assistant AMs to aid in overseeing and managing the audit.
          2.3.7.1.11. Conferences and Site Visits. Discuss the need to have an opening or mid-
          point audit conference. Also, discuss plans to visit application sites during the audit.
          2.3.7.1.12. Resources and Milestones. Identify total resources needed to complete
          the audit, audit milestones, and audit locations (including the basis for their
          selection). Note: Remember to include an appropriate amount of time for local
          auditors to accomplish the planning steps for their local audits.
       2.3.7.2. The AM will document any agreements reached during the go/no-go briefing in
       the Go/No-Go Briefing procedure step.
       2.3.7.3. If a ―nogo‖ decision is made, the AM will prepare a memorandum canceling and
       closing out the project. The AD will sign and send the memorandum to the same
       addressees as were sent the planning memorandum.
   2.3.8. Research-Results Briefing to Management. The AM, with the assistance of the PM
   and AD, will prepare and deliver a research-results briefing to management (HQ USAF or
   MAJCOM officials) before proceeding to audit application. The purpose of the briefing is to
   provide the research results and discuss the audit approach. Note: This briefing is not
   required for follow-up audits and request audits where the ACP met with the requesting
   official during research.
2.4. Audit Announcement Memorandum. After the decision to perform an audit, the AM will
prepare, and the AAG will sign, the audit announcement memorandum. A template is located on
the AFAA Home CoP. Choose the project title in the memorandum subject line carefully as it
will later be the title of the report (paragraph 4.2.3.1).
   2.4.1. Announcement Procedures. Prepare the audit announcement memorandum following
   the instructions below and in Attachment 2.
       2.4.1.1. Project Title. Use the same title as shown on the planning memorandum. If it is
       necessary to revise the project title from that shown on the planning announcement
       memorandum, identify the original title in the first paragraph of the audit announcement
       memorandum. Note: The title should be indicative of coverage provided (i.e., it should
       indicate the audit parameters and limitations and MAJCOM orientation, when
       applicable). Avoid all-inclusive or nebulous titles.
20                                                               AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


     2.4.1.2. Project Number. The project number should be identical to the AFAA MIS-
     generated number cited in the planning announcement memorandum.
     2.4.1.3. Overall Objective. The overall audit objective will clearly communicate to the
     reader what the audit intends to accomplish and the audit focus. The audit focus refers to
     the subject area (i.e., program, system, subsystem, activity, or function).
     2.4.1.4. Subobjectives.      Normally include specific subobjectives in the audit
     announcement memorandum. Listing subobjectives may help management understand
     the overall audit objective. Specific subobjectives should address each major segment of
     the audit and clearly convey to the client and AFAA managers what the audit intends to
     accomplish to meet the overall objective.
         2.4.1.4.1. Performance audits typically do not include a subobjective to evaluate
         internal controls. Instead, during the planning phase of each performance audit, the
         AM will test internal controls that are significant to the audit objectives and
         subobjectives to determine the nature, timing, and extent of any additional detailed
         audit tests deemed necessary.
         2.4.1.4.2. Audits in which the sole objective is to review internal controls should
         include subobjectives to determine the effectiveness of those controls.
         2.4.1.4.3. Financial audits should include a subobjective to determine if an entity has
         adequately designed and effectively implemented a system of internal controls.
         2.4.1.4.4. For areas having prior audit coverage, the subobjectives should address the
         prior recommendations requiring follow-up action (paragraph 2.3.4.2).
     2.4.1.5. AuditLocations.     Include application sites in the audit announcement
     memorandum.
     2.4.1.6. Distribution Procedures. The distribution procedures in paragraphs 2.3.3.2 and
     2.3.3.3 apply. Additionally, e-mail the audit announcement memorandum to each
     MAJCOM gatekeeper when applying an audit in that MAJCOM. Include the Project
     Plan Report with all internal distribution.
  2.4.2. Follow-up Announcement Memorandum. Announce follow-up audits to management
  sufficiently in advance of the audit start to allow a response from management officials
  regarding the intended audit coverage.
     2.4.2.1. General Requirements. The AM will prepare, and the AAG will sign, the
     follow-up audit announcement memorandum. A template is located on the AFAA Home
     CoP. This will be the only notification document issued to management. Identify
     application sites in the memorandum. If management did not complete corrective actions
     identified in the original report, the follow-up announcement memorandum will explain
     why the audit is being initiated.
     2.4.2.2. Reports With Monetary Benefits. The follow-up announcement memorandum
     for reports with monetary benefits will indicate the audit result in the original report
     containing monetary benefits and have a specific subobjective for their validation.
  2.4.3. Management Responses. Soliciting feedback in planning and audit announcement
  memorandums is an effective means of involving management in the early stages of the audit
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                         21


   process. Management’s concerns and suggestions can preclude unnecessary expenditure of
   audit resources and provide additional information for determining audit scope.
       2.4.3.1. Acknowledge management input and indicate in the memorandum what actions
       will be taken, if any, in response to management’s suggestions and other comments.
       2.4.3.2. Include the management input and associated audit response in the planning-
       phase working paper file.
Section B—Audit Design
2.5. General Guidance. The CDAP provides the guidance necessary to achieve the announced
objectives. The nature and complexity of the issues involved determine the CDAP contents.
The CDAP results must provide sufficient, appropriate evidence to support conclusions for each
audit objective. Field auditors at AAOs listed on the Project Plan Report will apply all or
designated portions of the CDAP.
   2.5.1. CDAPResponsibilities.
       2.5.1.1. Audit Manager. The AM is responsible for developing the CDAP. The AM
       will:
          2.5.1.1.1. Start the project with the standardized CDA TeamMate library template
          and tailor the template to the needs of the audit.
          2.5.1.1.2. Provide the CDAP to the application sites by the due date (the date
          specified in the Project Plan Report provided to the AAOs).
       2.5.1.2. Program Manager. The PM is responsible for providing the AM technical
       guidance and reviewing and approving the CDAP. The PM will:
          2.5.1.2.1. Verify the CDAP will achieve all audit objectives the AAG approved at the
          go/no-go briefing, and ensure working papers document AAG approval for any
          deviation from the work agreed to at the go/no-go briefing.
          2.5.1.2.2. Verify the CDAP does not include additional work to achieve audit
          objectives not discussed and agreed to at the go/no-go briefing.
          2.5.1.2.3. Document CDAP reviews using TeamMate coaching notes and sign the
          CDAP transmittal memorandum.       The PM’s signature on the transmittal
          memorandum documents CDAP approval.
          2.5.1.2.4. Ensure the CDAP is provided to the AAOs approximately 2 weeks prior to
          the start date specified in the Project Plan Report.
   2.5.2. Program Sources. Research working papers are the principle source of information for
   use in developing a CDAP. A good starting point for the CDAP is the research section of the
   CDA Planning Program. Additional sources may include Air Force and MAJCOM
   regulations and previously issued audit programs.
2.6. Centrally Directed Audit Program Contents.
   2.6.1. CDAP Transmittal Memorandum. The CDAP transmittal memorandum will identify
   the (a) audit purpose, (b) audit objectives, (c) ACP responsibilities, (d) general guidance, (e)
   instructions for developing and reporting audit findings, and (f) policies for contacting the
22                                                               AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


  AM to report audit progress and seek technical assistance. A template is located on the
  AFAA Home CoP. Note: The AM can forward the transmittal memorandum and CDA
  Overview (paragraph 2.6.2) to the applying teams and AAOs via e-mail or post the
  information on the project CoP.
  2.6.2. CDA Overview. The CDA overview will reiterate the audit’s purpose and objectives
  and include the following information obtained during the research portion of the planning
  phase:
     2.6.2.1. Background. Background data sufficient to provide field auditors a good
     understanding of the subject under review.
     2.6.2.2. Fraud Assessment. Results of the AM’s fraud assessment accomplished and
     documented during research.
     2.6.2.3. Internal Control Assessment. Results of the AM’s internal control assessment
     accomplished and documented during research.
     2.6.2.4. Systems and Computer-Processed Data. Computer systems and related reports
     and products (to include information on sampling) that field auditors will use during the
     audit.
     2.6.2.5. Forms. Air Force and MAJCOM forms auditors will come into contact with
     together with an explanation of how they will use the forms in the audit.
     2.6.2.6. Magnitude. Budget dollars, equipment and material costs, numbers of people,
     and other ―perspective‖ information obtained during research.
     2.6.2.7. Prior Audit Coverage. The results of AFAA, GAO, DoD OIG, or public
     accounting firm audits and attestation engagements conducted in the past 5 years with the
     same objectives as the current audit.
     2.6.2.8. Responsibilities. Specific Air Force, MAJCOM, and local responsibilities
     identified in Air Force, MAJCOM, and local directives.
     2.6.2.9. Criteria. Air Force and MAJCOM regulations (policy directives, instructions,
     manuals, etc.) governing the audited activities and links to where they are located, if
     possible. Provide specific references (numbers, titles, relevant volumes, chapters, and
     paragraphs) the auditors need to read and understand before applying the program and
     conducting the audit. ACPs are also encouraged to either include the criteria or links to
     the criteria on the project CoP.
     2.6.2.10. Processes. Identify current managerial and operational processes in the audit
     area and major initiatives, ongoing or planned that will affect the current processes.
     2.6.2.11. Terms, Definitions, and Acronyms. Applicable terms, definitions, and
     acronyms the auditors will encounter during the audit.
     2.6.2.12. Classified Information. Instructions on handling classified information if the
     CDAP has chapters or sections dealing with classified information. The CDAP will
     remind the auditor not to discuss classified information on the phone or send classified
     files using e-mail or file transfer protocol (FTP), and will refer the auditor to AFAAI 65-
     103, Chapter 5, for additional guidance.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                         23


     2.6.2.13. For Official Use Only (FOUO) Information. Instructions on how to handle
     FOUO information and a reference to AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5, for additional guidance,
     if applicable.
     2.6.2.14. Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Instructions on how to properly
     handle, transfer, and label documents containing PII, and/or remove PII when not
     required to support audit results, are included in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5.
  2.6.3. CDAP Chapter 1. The purpose of Chapter 1 is to provide audit planning steps for the
  local audits and to obtain information that will later appear in the scope sections of the
  installation-level audit reports. Work on some of the scope steps will start during the
  planning phase but will not be completed until near the end of the audit. Chapter 1 will
  provide steps requiring field auditors to:
     2.6.3.1. Complete an Independence Statement either annually (by the beginning of the
     fiscal year) or upon changing jobs or locations (whichever is sooner) in accordance with
     AFAAI 65103, Chapter 8, certifying there are no relationships and beliefs that might
     cause the auditor or supervisor to limit the extent of the inquiry, limit disclosure, or slant
     audit results in any way. Note: The auditor, team chief, office chief, independent
     referencer, and any other individuals that worked on the local project, will sign annual
     independence statements and retain the statements in the local working papers (AFAAI
     65-101, Chapter 2).
     2.6.3.2. Coordinate the audit topic with the local Air Force Office of Special
     Investigations (AFOSI).
     2.6.3.3. Prepare the audit announcement memorandum using information provided by
     the AM in the CDAP and following the guidance in AFAAI 65-101, Chapter 2. An audit
     announcement template is located on the AFAA Home CoP.
     2.6.3.4. Conduct the audit in-brief (AFAAI 65-101, Chapter 2). Inform local
     management officials of the audit objective, scope, and estimated time frame of the audit
     and assure there are no scheduling conflicts. Discuss scheduling conflicts and ask
     management to identify related areas they would like addressed during the audit.
     2.6.3.5. Perform necessary research to gain familiarity with the subject matter (e.g.,
     obtain and review applicable local guidance).
     2.6.3.6. Determine if there have been any prior audits (AFAA, DoD OIG, GAO, or
     public accounting firms) with similar objectives accomplished in the past 5 years
     involving the audit client. Government auditing standards require auditors to follow up
     on significant findings and recommendations from previous audits to determine if
     management took timely and appropriate corrective actions.
     2.6.3.7. Gather information to build the audit framework as well as to support the
     introduction paragraph of the audit report. Obtain information concerning: (a) the
     primary/subordinate mission of the audited function/organization; (b) the magnitude of
     resources (in terms of funding, material, personnel, etc.); and identify key personnel and
     define their areas of authority and responsibility.
     2.6.3.8. Identify local metrics, standards, or goals managers use to assess performance.
24                                                                AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


     2.6.3.9. Using the AM’s internal control assessment as a starting point, identify local
     internal controls and compliance with higher headquarters’ internal controls to determine
     if established controls (a) are working as intended and (b) provide reasonable assurance
     of detecting or preventing errors, irregularities, inefficiencies, or uneconomical practices.
     Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 7, for additional details on identifying internal
     controls.
     2.6.3.10. Using the AM’s fraud assessment as a starting point, identify local conditions
     that could indicate fraud, especially when auditing areas with high potential for errors,
     irregularities, and illegal acts.
     2.6.3.11. Identify any computer systems used and computer-processed data and reports
     necessary to accomplish the audit and that will later support the audit conclusions. Note:
     Additional computer-processed data may be identified during audit. Also, computer-
     processed data should be tested during the audit phase (AFAAI 65-101, Chapter 2).
     2.6.3.12. Document CAATTS use (or non-use) during the audit. Refer to AFAAI 65-
     103, Chapter 11, for details.
     2.6.3.13. Document the sampling methodology (or non-use) used during the audit. Refer
     to AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 11, for details.
     2.6.3.14. Identify and document the fieldwork start and completion dates.
     2.6.3.15. Identify the dates of documents reviewed during the audit.
  2.6.4. CDAP Remaining Chapters. The AM should normally address each announced
  subobjective in a separate CDAP chapter.
     2.6.4.1. Identify the subobjective to be evaluated in the chapter. The subobjective should
     be included in the audit announcement memorandum.
     2.6.4.2. Include additional background information the auditor will need to know to
     accomplish the chapter steps.
     2.6.4.3. Include additional criteria not previously discussed in the CDAP that apply to
     the chapter steps, and identify any specific reports and forms the auditor will use in the
     chapter. Identify the local source for obtaining these items, if known.
     2.6.4.4. Insert information from the exception report and, when possible, provide
     examples of potential local findings (including local condition, cause, and effect).
     2.6.4.5. Insert steps to conduct audit tests as needed to develop Air Force-level and local
     findings (paragraph 2.6.5), determine data reliability (paragraph 2.6.6), test internal
     controls (paragraph 2.6.7), test for fraud (for high/medium risk areas) (paragraph 2.6.8),
     and follow up on prior audits (paragraph 2.6.9).
  2.6.5. Audit Tests. The CDAP must enable auditors to obtain sufficient, appropriate
  evidence to reach valid conclusions on each subobjective as well as the overall objective.
  The AM must:
     2.6.5.1. Design audit tests and data-gathering procedures to facilitate subsequent
     summarization and reporting. Use spreadsheets and tables to aid in summarizing data.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       25


     Planning for summarization and reporting during program development will reduce the
     time needed to complete the audit.
     2.6.5.2. Include steps to quantify the magnitude of the deficient condition (e.g., X of XX
     items reviewed).
     2.6.5.3. Include steps addressing probable causes, which frequently will be control-
     related (e.g., inadequate guidance, oversight, performance measures, or training). Steps
     should seek to identify the root cause. For example, it is not sufficient to tell
     management that personnel were not complying with a particular requirement – this is
     not the root cause. Management also needs to know if employees lacked familiarity with
     the requirement; did not have time to complete the requirement due to higher priorities;
     or lacked training to complete the requirement. Management may contribute to the
     problem by failing to provide oversight, assigning too few staff to a task, or under-
     emphasizing the importance of a task.
     2.6.5.4. Include steps to quantify the effect (e.g., impact on mission or resources) of
     deficient conditions. Whenever possible, design steps to capture ―real‖ instead of
     ―potential‖ effect.
     2.6.5.5. Include audit tests that provide coverage of management’s suggested issues or
     concerns, if applicable.
     2.6.5.6. Whenever possible, use CAATTs to obtain a 100 percent data download and
     draw conclusions for the entire population. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 11.
     2.6.5.7. If sampling is used, clearly identify the sampling plan and data the AM requires
     from the applying offices. Whether using non-statistical or statistical sampling, the
     program should provide guidance on selection parameters and the number of items
     required for testing. Coordinate sampling plans with AFAA statisticians. Reference
     AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 11.
  2.6.6. Tests of Computer-Processed Data. Government auditing standards require auditors
  to determine the reliability of computer-processed data when the data is crucial to
  accomplishing the audit objectives. Consequently, whenever an audit relies on computer-
  processed data and reports as evidence to support an audit result, the CDAP should include
  tests to verify the accuracy of the data and reports. If the AM uses the computer-processed
  data only for background or information purposes, citing the sources of the data is sufficient.
  Note: If the AM does the work to verify data reliability for the audit locations, the AM must
  provide the audit locations an appropriate data reliability statement for their local reports
  (AFAAI 65-103, Attachment 3). Refer to AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 9, and GAO-09-680G,
  Assessing the Reliability of Computer-Processed Data, for additional information on data
  testing methods and associated reporting.
  2.6.7. Internal Controls. All CDAPs must include appropriate tests of internal controls.
  During research, the AM should have identified the significant controls (paragraph 2.3.4.1.2)
  and formed a preliminary assessment. Based on this information, each CDAP will:
     2.6.7.1. Identify and discuss the critical controls. When possible, include flowcharts to
     illustrate the discussion.
 26                                                                AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


      2.6.7.2. Include audit steps to test the effectiveness of and compliance with these
      controls. Weak or nonexistent controls or lack of compliance will frequently be the cause
      for deficient conditions and are a red flag for fraud.
   2.6.8. Fraud and Illegal Acts. Include steps which provide reasonable assurance for
   detecting fraud when auditing in areas where the potential for fraud exists and (a) the AM
   doubts the effectiveness of the established controls, (b) planning-phase audit tests indicated a
   lack of compliance with significant controls, or (c) controls were not tested in the planning
   phase.
   2.6.9. Follow-Up on Related Prior Audits. For audits where one objective is to follow-up on
   a prior report (paragraph 2.3.4.1.8), limit the scope of the follow-up work to the specific
   findings and recommendations in the prior audit report that are similar to the current audit.
   Do not follow up on every finding and recommendation in the prior report. Audit steps
   should be sufficient to fully develop a ―repeat‖ finding if the condition still exists.
   2.6.10. Special Requirements.
      2.6.10.1. Data Retrievals. If applicable, include the retrieval program and instructions
      for running the retrieval in the CDAP. Test the retrieval prior to publishing the CDAP.
      2.6.10.2. Technical Assistance. When the AM, AFAA statisticians, or other technical
      experts are to provide direct assistance (i.e., work with the field auditors in performing
      some task), the CDAP should indicate when, where, and what assistance will be
      provided. Coordinate planned use of technical experts prior to publishing the CDAP.
      2.6.10.3. Consultants. Coordinate planned use of outside consultants with HQ
      AFAA/DOO prior to publishing the CDAP. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 20.
2.7. Centrally Directed Audit Program Processing.
   2.7.1. Transmittal Memorandum. Each CDAP must have a transmittal memorandum signed
   by the PM (paragraph 2.6.1). The PM’s signature documents CDAP approval.
   2.7.2. Distribution. Approximately 2 weeks before starting the audit, e-mail (or post to the
   project CoP) the CDAP and transmittal memorandum to each participating AAO (office and
   team chief). Note: The AM will include a copy of the CDAP in the final report package to
   HQ AFAA/DOO (paragraph 5.5.1.7).
   2.7.3. Start Delay. If the application start date will slip because of a delay in completing the
   CDAP, the AM will notify all participating offices, regions, and directorates. The
   notification will indicate a revised mailing date. Also, the ACP must update the AFAA MIS
   and the AAG must approve the revised project plan.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       27

        hours).
     3.2.4.2. Site Visits. Visits audit sites as needed during program application to evaluate
     the audit work accomplished using the ―CDA Application Site Visit Checklist‖ (a
     template is included on the AFAA Home CoP). Note: In addition to on-site visits, the
     AM may elect to hold audit conferences with the field auditors before or during the
     application period.
        3.2.4.2.1. Plans visits based on the audit site’s criticality to the audit’s success and
        problems encountered by the applying AAO.
        3.2.4.2.2. Provides notification at least 1 week in advance of a site visit and is
        sensitive to the workload of the auditee by scheduling visits around unusual or peak
        workloads.
        3.2.4.2.3. Reviews installation-level working papers for technical accuracy during
        site visits and documents the review for inclusion in the local working papers.
        Documents the review using TeamMate coaching notes or in a separate document or
        checklist. Addresses working paper support problems with the auditor and team chief
        during the visit. Refers unresolved differences to the office chief and PM for
        resolution.
        3.2.4.2.4. Minimizes disruption of normal AAO activities and keeps the team chief

        directorate on the 30-day calendar.
     3.2.4.3. Program Manager Coordination. Keeps the PM informed on how the audit is
     progressing (paragraph 3.2.3.3) and notifies the PM of any results requiring possible
     action. It may be necessary, for example, to reduce or terminate work on one objective
     and expand work on another objective.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       29


       3.2.4.4. Application Results. Receives incoming information (CDAP Response Sheets,
       spreadsheets, etc.) from the application sites. Ensures data are complete and
       understandable, and the auditors completed all required steps. Every step should have an
       answer and explanation.
           3.2.4.4.1. Spot checks tables and spreadsheets for accuracy.
           3.2.4.4.2. Ensures the team chief certifies the CDAP Response Sheet data in
           accordance with paragraph 4.10.5.2.6 and AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 4.
       3.2.4.5. Draft Report. Time permitting, begins work on the draft report (especially the
       background paragraphs and report appendices).
3.3. Working Paper Requirements. AMs will use the latest TeamMate Library, TeamMate
templates, and AFAA Toolkit located on the AFAA Home CoP to establish current files for each
audit project. The use of electronic working papers greatly reduces the requirement to print and
manually store audit working papers and significantly enhances the summarization and review
processes. Manually prepared working papers will only be used on an exception basis, such as
when accomplishing a classified audit without secure computer support. In addition to the
following paragraphs, AFAAI 65103, Chapter 6 and Attachment 7, provide important criteria for
preparing working papers.
   3.3.1. General Requirements. Organize working papers to facilitate supervisory review and
   ensure subsequent reviewers can easily follow the AM’s logic and find support for the audit
   results. The AM must provide the PM and independent referencer with a road map through
   the working papers that clearly shows all steps taken in the audit process.
       3.3.1.1. All audit support must be attached (i.e., hyperlinked) to a procedure step that
       contains purpose, source, details, and conclusion (PSDC). It is not necessary to include
       PSDC information on each supporting working paper, as long as said documents are
       linked to procedure steps. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6, for additional
       information on PSDC working paper requirements. Note: If a procedure step includes
       several different spreadsheets or other supporting documents, it may be necessary to
       include the ―source‖ information on the individual spreadsheets or other supporting
       documents if it is not easily discernable from the ―source‖ section of the procedure step.
       3.3.1.2. Place responses and detailed information related to the planning and audit
       program steps in the appropriate folders.
       3.3.1.3. Hyperlink files following guidance in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6. Note: Do not
       hyperlink to web-based documents or any documents outside of the TeamMate project.
       Always hyperlink to files that are part of the current project file structure.
   3.3.2. Supervisory Review. PMs will review all project working papers following
   supervisory requirements contained in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6, and use TeamMate
   coaching notes to record review questions, taskings, and overall comments (both favorable
   and unfavorable). Also, the PM must sign off on each auditor-prepared electronic working
   paper file. At a minimum, the PM will perform and document project oversight monthly or
   for each audit phase, whichever is sooner. Project oversight should be more frequent for
   AMs performing their first CDA.
       3.3.2.1. The AM will respond to all TeamMate coaching notes.
 30                                                                 AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


       3.3.2.2. The PM will follow up on all TeamMate coaching notes to ensure the AM’s
       reply is responsive (i.e., the response adequately addresses the issue raised) and then clear
       the note
   3.3.3. File Maintenance. TeamMate should be set-up to automatically backup daily. The
   ACP may also elect to perform additional backups manually. To prevent accidental data
   loss, auditors will backup electronic files on a CD, DVD, server, or other storage device in
   accordance with directorate policy. Backup and primary locations should be different
   storage mediums (i.e., primary and backup files should not be stored on the same device).
   After the audit is completed and the final report is issued, the auditor will store (archive) the
   working papers in accordance with instructions in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5. Note: AFAAI
   65-103, Chapter 5, also provides guidance for marking and safeguarding (a) classified,
   FOUO, PII (to include Privacy Act data), and fraud-related working papers; and (b) labeling,
   password protecting, and retaining working papers.
3.3.4. Changing Archived Files. Changing archived working paper files is not permitted for
any reason. If the need arises to add or modify archived working paper files, create a separate
project folder named ―Post-Audit Adjustments‖ in accordance with the instructions provided in
the AFAA TeamMate Desk Reference.
   3.3.5. Manual Working Papers. Manual working papers should rarely be used. However, if
   manual working papers are deemed necessary, record complete identification data on the first
   page of each working paper (Activity, Project Number, Installation, Auditor, Date, Reviewer,
   Working Paper Title, Page Number, and Index). When you have more than one page of a
   working paper with the same index and working paper title, you may omit entries in the
   ―Activity,‖ ―Working Paper Title,‖ and ―Installation‖ blocks from all subsequent pages of the
   working paper. Manual working papers must be referenced in the electronic TeamMate files
   (via a ―manual working paper‖ procedure step) to indicate additional supporting
   documentation exists.
3.4. Miscellaneous Application Issues. During CDAP application, auditors may identify
potential fraud or illegal acts. In addition, AMs may find it necessary to revise audit objectives,
CDAP steps, or project milestones or to terminate the audit project without issuing a report.
When these situations arise, follow the guidance below.
   3.4.1. Indications of Fraud. When indications of fraud are discovered at one audit location,
   the AM will cross feed this information to the other audit locations to determine if the same
   conditions exist at other sites and whether systemic control weaknesses exist. Coordinate the
   matter with the cognizant AFAA office (AAO, MAJCOM representative, or SAF/AGA) and
   HQ AFAA/DOO. Depending on the circumstances, the AM or AAO personnel may perform
   extended audit work, refer issues to the commander and AFOSI, or issue an interim report.
   3.4.2. Objective Changes. If it becomes necessary to add, delete, or change an audit
   objective during audit application, issue a revised audit announcement memorandum to all
   recipients of the original audit announcement memorandum that identifies and explains the
   change. If the objective change causes milestone or location changes, the ACP will update
   the AFAA MIS and the appropriate AAG must approve the revised project plan (reference
   paragraph 3.2.1.2).
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                         31


   3.4.3. CDAP Changes. AMs may revise the CDAP at any time during the audit. Make
   revisions based on new information, changes in Air Force policies, or initial audit results, as
   needed, to improve the project. The PM must approve CDAP revisions. Make distribution
   in accordance with paragraph 2.7.2 Note: Make minor adjustments to audit tests via e-mail.
   3.4.4. Milestone Changes. If the AM changes the CDAP, and the change requires additional
   audit resources or causes milestone dates to slip, the AM will notify all participating offices
   and regions in accordance with paragraph 3.7 The ACP must also update the AFAA MIS
   and the appropriate AAG must approve the revised project plan (reference paragraph
   3.2.1.2).
   3.4.5. Early Project Termination. If it becomes necessary to terminate an announced audit
   without a report during the application phase, the AAG will coordinate the termination with
   SAF/AG.
       3.4.5.1. With SAF/AG approval, the ACP will issue a closure memorandum canceling
       the project. Issue the closure memorandum to the Air Force OPR, offices of collateral
       responsibility (OCRs), and all other offices that received the audit announcement
       memorandum. HQ AFAA/DOO will update the AFAA MIS.
       3.4.5.2. The closure memorandum should reference the audit announcement
       memorandum (paragraph 2.4), advise why the audit was terminated, and explain that an
       audit report will not be issued.
Section B—Summarization and Validation
3.5. Summarization. The AM is responsible for summarizing information (CDAP Response
Sheet data, spreadsheets, etc.) provided by CDA participants. This process includes the
consolidation, review, and analysis of audit results, including installationlevel reports of audit.
The AM will also ensure AAOs comply with quality control procedures established to ensure
data reliability (paragraph 4.10.5.2.6).      Additional instructions for documenting audit
summarization can be found in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6.
3.6. Validation. AMs validate audit results at HQ USAF and MAJCOM levels prior to
preparing the draft report. The AM will either use the exception report or prepare a point paper
of preliminary audit results as a basis for discussions with management. The PM and/or AD will
attend validation meetings with the AM as deemed appropriate. During validation, the AM will:
   3.6.1. Discuss the audit results with appropriate action officers and higher management
   officials. If these officials believe the audit results are inaccurate or the ACP misinterpreted
   specific data, the AM should re-verify the data’s accuracy and reassess whether the
   conclusions were accurately derived.
   3.6.2. Discuss proposed recommendations with management. The AM should be willing to
   discuss with management the actions they believe are necessary to correct the cited
   conditions.
   3.6.3. Disclose and discuss any known installation-level audit report nonconcurrences.
   3.6.4. Conduct audit tests, as necessary, or examine documentary evidence to determine the
   validity of management officials’ statements that may impact the context, perspective, or
   accuracy of audit results.
 32                                                                AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


   3.6.5. Document all validation work in working papers that meet paragraph 3.3
   requirements. Also, document all discussions in a related procedure step.
Section C—Interaction with AAOs
3.7. Requesting Additional Information. During summarization and validation, the AM may
need to contact participating AAOs to request additional information and audit work. AMs
should retain a copy of all requests (e-mail or written) in the project files.
   3.7.1. Requests-Less Than 20 Percent. The AM makes requests for additional information
   or audit work to the team chief by e-mail if the additional work will take less than 20 percent
   of the original authorized hours.
   3.7.2. Requests-20 Percent or More.The PM makes requests for additional information or
   audit work by e-mail to the team and AAO chiefs if the additional work will take more than
   20 percent of the original authorized hours.
3.8. Reviewing Installation-Level Reports. The local auditor will forward a draft copy of the
installation-level report and associated SAR statement to the AM for review and approval before
outbriefing the report to management. The AM will review the draft report for consistency and
technical accuracy and either approve it for release or, if the report is not ready for release,
respond to the local auditor indicating the needed changes. The AM will complete the review
within 5 workdays of first receipt of the draft report. After the local auditor completes the
agreed-to changes, the AM will approve the report in an e-mail to the team chief. If the AM and
team chief cannot reach agreement on the installation-level report, they will elevate the
unresolved issues to the PM and AAO chief for resolution.
   3.8.1. Consistency. While reviewing local reports, the AM will verify conclusions and
   recommendations are consistent with anticipated Air Force-level audit results. The AM will
   also obtain explanations for differences between the information in the report and
   information the local auditor previously submitted in CDAP Response Sheets, if applicable.
   Note: Installation-level audit reports do not always address issues contained in the Air
   Force-level report. Further, Air Force-level reports do not necessarily summarize all
   installation-level audit results.
   3.8.2. Technical Accuracy. The AM will provide any recommended technical changes to the
   report, or notification that the report is technically accurate, to the team chief. The team
   chief will discuss and coordinate technical changes with the AM - normally within 2
   workdays of receiving the recommended technical changes.
   3.8.3. Report Changes. The team chief will notify the AM of any changes made to the
   installation-level report and SAR statement after the initial review. The AM will review the
   report changes, assess their impact on the CDA report, and adjust the Air Force report prior
   to issuance if the installation-level report changes affect the Air Force audit report. Note: If
   the AM issued the Air Force report before receiving AAO changes affecting the Air Force
   report, the AM and PM should elevate the problem to the AD for resolution. Such situations
   may require supplementing either the Air Force or installation-level reports.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                           33


                                            Chapter 4

                                       DRAFT REPORT

4.1. Overview. AFAA will issue an Air Force-level audit report (either clear or with findings)
on all projects with a completed application phase. AFAA will also issue a report on projects
terminated at the end of the planning phase or curtailed prior to completion of audit application,
provided auditors performed sufficient work to render an opinion. This chapter provides
guidance for preparing, processing, issuing, and assuring the quality of draft CDA reports.
Projects that do not meet the criteria for a report (e.g., projects that were terminated during
application without sufficient, appropriate evidence to form an opinion) should be closed with a
memorandum (paragraph 3.4.5).
Section A – Reporting CDA Results
4.2. Report Types. The AFAA issues two types of Air Force reports: standard (regular or
follow-up) and interim (quick-reaction or preliminary). Standard reports (also known as an Air
Force Report of Audit) are written in tab format, and interim reports are written in memorandum
format. Regardless of the report type, the same report processing procedures apply. Any
deviation from the approved report formats discussed below requires HQ AFAA/DO
coordination and AAG approval.
   4.2.1. Standard Report. The standard Air Force Report of Audit represents the normal
   reporting vehicle for conveying the results of Air Force-wide audits.
       4.2.1.1. Regular Report. If the summarization and verification results identify deficient
       conditions, the ACP will issue a report to inform Air Force management of the audit
       results so they can implement corrective actions. If the audit identifies only positive
       conditions not requiring corrective actions, the ACP will issue a clear report so
       management can properly assess the operations reviewed.
       4.2.1.2. Follow-up Report. Auditors accomplishing follow-up on significant findings
       and recommendations from prior Air Force audit reports will issue a report to inform
       management if corrective actions taken fixed the previously identified problems. The
       report title should indicate the review was a follow-up (i.e., ―Follow-up Audit--……..‖).
       Clearly distinguish in the new report between the new and prior results. See additional
       guidance for follow-up reports in paragraph 4.6
   4.2.2. Interim Report. Issue an interim report (a) when audit results require prompt
   management attention and timeliness is critical (quick-reaction report) or (b) to convey the
   audit status for a lengthy audit (preliminary report). The interim report provides management
   an opportunity to initiate early corrective actions on identified findings and for the auditors to
   acknowledge those actions in the audit report. Report findings will contain condition, cause,
   effect, supporting details, and recommendations (paragraph 4.7).
       4.2.2.1. Quick-Reaction Report. Issue a quick reaction report when audit results require
       prompt management attention. Such situations relate to: endangered lives, illegal
       actions, pending procurements that are not in the best interest of the Air Force, waste of
       large sums of money or other resources, a short window of opportunity to realize
34                                                                 AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


     monetary benefits, proposed or ongoing actions that could cause significant
     embarrassment to the Air Force, or deficiencies in mission capabilities.
     4.2.2.2. Preliminary Report. Issue a preliminary report to provide management audit
     status during a lengthy audit, such as when auditing an automated data processing system
     during implementation.
  4.2.3. Standard Report Requirements. Write standard Air Force Reports of Audit in the tab
  format described in paragraphs 4.3 through 4.5 and the template located on the AFAA Home
  CoP. Standard report segments include the executive summary, audit results tabs, and
  appendices, as well as a cover page and table of contents. Include a tab in all reports,
  including clear reports, and a tab summarizing installation-level audit results, when
  appropriate. Attach a SAR statement to the report transmittal memorandum (called the OPR
  memorandum).
     4.2.3.1. Cover Page. Insert a cover page just before the executive summary identifying
     the report title and project number. The report title will normally be the same as the audit
     announcement memorandum title. The report template cover page is included on the
     AFAA Home CoP.
     4.2.3.2. Table of Contents. The report template includes a table of contents after the
     executive summary; revise the table of contents as necessary to reflect actual report
     contents.
     4.2.3.3. Clear Tab. Include at least one tab in all reports. In clear reports (reports that do
     not identify any deficient conditions), include a tab describing the positive conditions
     noted in the audit.
     4.2.3.4. Installation-Level Audit Results Tab. When applicable, identify significant
     installation-level audit results that are not systemic but that HQ USAF or a MAJCOM
     should be made aware. Normally include this information in a separate Installation-Level
     Audit Results tab.
         4.2.3.4.1. Examples of conditions to report in the Installation-Level Audit Results tab
         are instances of noncompliance or fraud, waste, and abuse. State in the background
         section that the issues were correctable at base level and, therefore, AFAA considers
         further recommendations unnecessary.
         4.2.3.4.2. Prepare a brief paragraph for each audit result or group of related audit
         results from the installation-level reports. Identify bases the audit results relate to
         either in a footnote or the text. Although the Installation-Level Audit Results tab
         does not include recommendations, make reference to management actions proposed
         or taken.
     4.2.3.5. SAR Statement. Attach a SAR statement to the OPR memorandum for each
     draft audit report, including interim and clear reports. Use the SAR template located on
     the AFAA Home CoP. The SAR statement provides a coordinated basis for reporting the
     dollar value of monetary benefits and detailed data for Air Force budget personnel to use
     in responding to Congressional interest in dollar amounts included in audit reports.
         4.2.3.5.1. General. Prepare the SAR statement, Part I, for all draft and final audit
         reports whether or not reporting PMB. Prepare Part II for each finding with PMB of
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                          35


          $50,000 or more (enter N/A in Part IIA if no recommendations are applicable).
          Prepare Part III for Air Force reports only.
          4.2.3.5.2. Detailed Instructions. AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 17, contains detailed
          instructions for preparing the SAR statement. Of special importance is the
          appropriation description block. The appropriation data must be correct, complete,
          and relate to the command owning the assets or funds claimed. For example, if an
          audit at an Air Combat Command (ACC) base discloses excess recoverable assets
          owned by Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), use the operating agency code and
          related appropriation data for AFMC, not ACC. To obtain the correct data, AMs
          should work with the AFAA MAJCOM representative or SAF/AGA.
   4.2.4. Other Report Elements.
       4.2.4.1. Acronyms. Treat the report as one document, not as a series of stand-alone
       sections. Therefore, define abbreviations and acronyms the first time used in the report.
       The only standard abbreviations requiring no definitions are: DoD, USAF, AFB, and
       HQ. Use a Glossary of Acronyms appendix, when necessary, to list and define acronyms
       and abbreviations.
       4.2.4.2. Captions. Use captions on main paragraphs and subparagraphs as needed to
       draw the reader’s attention to specific information. Main-paragraph captions are in bold
       and subparagraph captions are underlined.
       4.2.4.3. Illustrations. Whenever practical, use charts, diagrams, schedules, maps,
       pictures, etc., to explain or illustrate audit results. Such illustrations, when properly and
       judiciously used, can improve communications and create reader interest in the report.
       Number schedules, exhibits, tables, etc. numerically throughout the report following the
       format shown in the standard report template.
       4.2.4.4. Page Numbering. Number pages consecutively from the first page of the basic
       report through the last blank page. Use blank pages for even numbers between the
       executive summary, results sections, appendices, and the last page of the report.
   4.2.5. Rehabilitation Act. In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to
   require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to
   people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure,
   maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 of the Act (29
   United States Code §794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the
   public access to information that is comparable to access available to others. Reference
   AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5, for specific requirements.
   4.2.6. Classified Reports. When an audit involves classified material (confidential, secret,
   top secret), follow the procedures in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5.
       4.2.6.1. For classified reports, send a marked-up copy of the report to the management
       OPR for a classification review before releasing the report for comment.
       4.2.6.2. The overall classification of the report will always be the same as the highest
       classification assigned to any one part of the report.
4.3. Standard Report Format—Executive Summary. The executive summary provides the
reader a brief overview of the audit and consists of five sections: introduction, objectives,
 36                                                                 AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


conclusions, recommendations, and management’s response. In addition, when the audit
identifies material control weaknesses (paragraphs 4.3.6 and 4.3.7), the executive summary will
include a section addressing the weaknesses.
   4.3.1. Introduction. The introduction section should be brief and provide only (a)
   information needed to understand the audit conclusions and (b) perspective on the magnitude
   of the audit entity. Provide additional background information in the tabs or the Background
   Information appendix, as appropriate. If the ACP issued an interim report, briefly synopsize
   the interim report results (audit results, recommendations, and management actions).
   4.3.2. Objectives. In the objectives section, explain why the audit was performed and state
   the audit’s overall objective followed by the subobjectives. Unless changed during the audit,
   the subobjectives should be similar to, or the same as, those stated in the audit announcement
   memorandum. If the subobjectives changed during the audit, provide a brief explanation in
   the objectives paragraph.
       4.3.2.1. For request audits, note this in the objectives paragraph and identify the
       requester’s title.
       4.3.2.2. For financial audits, include the stated objective to evaluate the internal control
       structure applicable to the audit subject area and identify the significant internal controls
       assessed, including controls established to ensure compliance with laws and regulations
       that have a material effect on the financial statements.
       4.3.2.3. For follow-up audits, if the original audit contained PMB, include an objective in
       the current audit to validate the PMB.
   4.3.3. Conclusions. The conclusions section should address the overall objective of the audit
   and the subobjectives in the order they are listed in the objectives section. Provide positive
   as well as negative audit results, and list the positive results first. Note: For reports that
   identify deficient conditions, it is not necessary to further discuss positive conditions in the
   tabs. It is sufficient to identify the positive conditions in the executive summary. However,
   the ACP may optionally provide additional information in a clear tab if the ACP wishes to
   describe in greater detail areas where management was exceptionally strong.
       4.3.3.1. The first sentence in the conclusion section main paragraph must contain a
       statement assessing the overall audit objective as stated in the objectives section.
       4.3.3.2. Succeeding subparagraphs will provide the audit results for each audit area
       (subobjective). For each audit result (positive or negative), include a results paragraph
       that briefly summarizes the positive or negative condition and effect. At the end of each
       results paragraph, indicate where the discussion is located in the report (e.g., Tab A, page
       1 or Tab B, page 7).
       4.3.3.3. Identify repeat deficiencies as ―repeat findings‖ along with the related report
       references. Follow guidance in paragraph 4.6.3.4 on reporting repeat findings.
       4.3.3.4. For financial audits, include an evaluation (either positive or negative) of the
       internal control structure.
       4.3.3.5. For clear reports, provide sufficient information in a clear tab to demonstrate the
       area had no deficiencies.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                         37


   4.3.4. Recommendations. Indicate the number and general nature of the recommendations.
   At the end of the recommendations section, include the following advisory statement:
   ―(Reference the individual tabs for specific recommendations.)‖ Note: The level of detail
   included in this paragraph should be suitable for inclusion in the AFAA Semi-Annual Report
   to Congress. An example of suitable verbiage would be: ―We made three recommendations
   to the Air Force Surgeon General to establish processes and provide guidance, training, and
   program oversight as it relates to medical case management.‖ Or, ―We made five
   recommendations to improve Voice Over Internet Protocol acquisition, security compliance
   requirements, and security controls.‖
   4.3.5. Management’s Response.       In the draft report, the ACP will insert
   ―MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSE‖ after the recommendations paragraph and leave space for
   a brief summary and evaluation of management comments in the final report (paragraph
   5.4.3).
   4.3.6. Material Control Weaknesses.        When the report identifies material control
   weaknesses, include the following as the last paragraph in the executive summary and in the
   OPR memorandum:
―The Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982, as codified in Title
31, United States Code, requires each federal agency head to annually certify to the
effectiveness of the agency’s internal and accounting system controls.
Recommendations (specify which) in this report address corrective actions needed to
improve the effectiveness of controls in the areas of (outline areas where controls
need improvement). In our opinion, the identified weaknesses are material FMFIA
Section 2 issues. Additionally, we will consider the weaknesses for inclusion in our
annual memorandum of material internal control weaknesses to the Secretary of the
Air Force and the DoD Inspector General.‖
       4.3.6.1. When making a determination to categorize an internal control weakness as
       material, consider the following:
          4.3.6.1.1. Is the control weakness of sufficient importance to warrant reporting the
          control deficiency to the next higher level of management? Such weaknesses:
              4.3.6.1.1.1. Significantly impair, or may impair, mission fulfillment or
              achievement of operational objectives.
              4.3.6.1.1.2. Violate statutory or regulatory requirements.
              4.3.6.1.1.3. Significantly weaken safeguards against         fraud,      waste,   or
              mismanagement of funds, property, or other assets.
              4.3.6.1.1.4. Could result in adverse publicity to the Air Force (generating media
              or congressional interest).
              4.3.6.1.1.5. Result in loss of control over a significant amount of resources
              (money, equipment, etc.) for which the organization is responsible.
          4.3.6.1.2. Is the control weakness systemic? A systemic control weakness is one that
          is widespread (i.e., occurs at most locations across the Air Force or in a MAJCOM).
          Systemic weaknesses result from ineffective implementation of guidance and/or from
          a failure to adequately identify or define the controls required.
 38                                                                 AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


           4.3.6.1.3. Is the control weakness exceptional? An exceptional weakness is one that
           is sufficiently material to warrant reporting to the next higher level but limited to one
           or a few locations (e.g., inadequate internal controls over installation force protection
           programs prevented the installation commander from effectively protecting personnel
           and facilities from potential terrorist acts.).
       4.3.6.2. Air Force-level audit reports should not identify control weaknesses as material
       (and include the standard FMFIA paragraph) unless the identified control problems need
       to be elevated to the next higher level of management and are either systemic (i.e., the
       control weaknesses were identified at a majority of the locations audited) or exceptional.
       4.3.6.3. The applicable AAG must approve, and the AFAA OPR for FMFIA
       (AFAA/FSC) must coordinate on, inclusion of the standard FMFIA paragraph in AFAA
       reports.
   4.3.7. Information Security Control Weaknesses.    When the report identifies material
   information security control weaknesses, include the following as the last paragraph in the
   executive summary and in the OPR memorandum:
―The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), as codified in Title III
of the E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107-347, requires each Chief
Information Officer to report material weaknesses in policies, procedures, or practices
annually to the Office of Management and Budget. Recommendations (specify
which) in this report address corrective actions needed to improve the effectiveness of
information security controls. In our opinion, each material weakness identified
meets the requirement for establishing an Air Force Plan of Action and Milestone or
Operational Deferment. In addition, we will consider these weaknesses for inclusion
in our annual FISMA input to the Secretary of the Air Force and the DoD Inspector
General.‖
       4.3.7.1. Air Force-level audit reports should not identify information security control
       weaknesses as material (and include the standard FISMA paragraph) unless the identified
       control problems need to be elevated to the next higher level of management and are
       either systemic (i.e., the control weakness was identified at a majority of the locations
       audited) or exceptional.
       4.3.7.2. The applicable AAG must approve, and the AFAA OPR for FISMA
       (AFAA/FSS) must coordinate on, inclusion of the standard FISMA paragraph in AFAA
       reports.
4.4. Standard Report Format—Tabs. Write all standard reports, including clear reports,
in tab format. Put each major audit result or group of related audit results in one tab. In
general, arrange tabs to present the most important audit results and recommendations
first and the least important last. The tab order must parallel the order of audit results
presented in the executive summary. Keep tab titles as short as possible. Identify the
subject for discussion rather than synopsize the results. For instance, use ―Cash Controls‖
not ―Lack of Control Over Cash.‖ The TeamMate CDA Report template is a starting point
for populating the report contents in the correct format.
   4.4.1. Synopsis (Optional). The AM is encouraged to include a synopsis in tabs that address
   more than one audit result or contain one long, complex audit result. If included, the
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                        39


  synopsis will briefly summarize the tab’s audit results in the same order as they are discussed
  in the report. In multi-tab reports, if one tab contains a synopsis, it is not necessary for the
  remaining tabs to have a synopsis.
  4.4.2. Background (Optional). Limit the background paragraph, if used, to information
  needed to understand the audit results presented in the tab and criteria used to conduct the
  audit. Do not provide extraneous information that does not facilitate an understanding of the
  results section issues. Include such information in the Background Information Appendix.
  In multi-tab reports, if one tab contains a background paragraph, it is not necessary for the
  remaining tabs to have a background paragraph. Use the background paragraph to:
     4.4.2.1. Criteria. Provide the reader with the criteria used to conduct the audit (e.g., Air
     Force policy directives and instructions, DoD directives, industry standards, and Federal
     and state laws).
     4.4.2.2. Mission, Magnitude, and Resources. Describe the mission, magnitude (dollar
     value and number of resources controlled and used), and operation of the audited activity.
     Do not normally repeat background information included in the executive summary.
     4.4.2.3. Additional Information. Provide additional information the reader needs to
     understand the issues discussed in the audit result. Where the audit result is unusual or
     complicated, use the background to explain the correct operations of the system and
     define technical terms.
  4.4.3. Audit Results. Each audit result will be numbered and titled (limit the title to one line
  in length) and have the following captioned paragraphs: condition, cause, effect,
  recommendations, management comments, and evaluation of management comments. When
  deemed appropriate, the order of the cause and effect paragraphs may be reversed. In
  addition, the audit results may also include captioned paragraphs for corrective actions
  management took during the audit and other audit comments.
     4.4.3.1. Condition. The condition paragraph describes the audit result in detail. Include
     all necessary facts using specific examples or cases to demonstrate the deficiency,
     promote an adequate understanding of the matters reported, and provide convincing but
     fair presentations in proper perspective. Use tables or supporting schedules to provide
     detailed statistical data and provide the reader a greater understanding of and appreciation
     for the magnitude of the problem.
         4.4.3.1.1. The first (topic) sentence should focus the reader on the condition noted as
         well as the relative significance of the condition. Describe the condition found using
         past tense and active voice.
         4.4.3.1.2. Clearly explain the nature, extent, and frequency of the deficiencies.
         Include all necessary facts using specific examples or cases to demonstrate the
         deficiency. Use supporting schedules to provide detailed statistical data or show the
         problem’s magnitude. Identify locations where auditors found the condition. State to
         what extent (quantity, percentage, etc.) management deviated from the established
         standard.
         4.4.3.1.3. State audit results clearly and concisely using non-technical terms to the
         extent possible. Avoid the use of vague or imprecise terminology (e.g., some, not
40                                                               AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


        many, not always). Round numbers to enhance clarity of presentation. Also, avoid
        the use of excessively lengthy paragraphs. Use subparagraphs and captions, when
        appropriate, to assist reader understanding. Note: Do not use personal information,
        such as names or social security numbers, or other extraneous information in audit
        reports.
        4.4.3.1.4. Do not include audit results and recommendations from reports of the
        AFOSI, as well as the Directors of Aerospace Safety, Nuclear Safety, Inspection,
        Security Forces and their command counterparts in AFAA audit reports. These
        reports are ―privileged‖ documents, and their contents are not releasable, in whole or
        part, outside the Air Force without the express approval of the Secretary of the Air
        Force, the Inspector General of the Air Force, or HQ AFOSI (AFI 65-401, Relations
        with the Government Accounting Office; AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities;
        and AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution). Because AFAA may
        distribute audit reports outside the Air Force, including such information in Air Force
        audit reports would violate this ―privileged‖ status. Reference AFAAI 65-103,
        Chapters 8 and 19.
     4.4.3.2. Cause. Identify the root cause first followed by the contributing causes. Provide
     related criteria if not already provided in the background. Do not include a negative
     cause for which there is no (a) recommendation or (b) completed management corrective
     action. Clear results paragraphs should contain a positive cause statement.
        4.4.3.2.1. The root cause is normally weak or absent controls or reasons for
        noncompliance with existing controls. It is the situation or procedure which, when
        changed or corrected, will solve the problem or condition. If the activity needs to
        improve controls, so state. If personnel did not follow directives, explain why not.
        4.4.3.2.2. To the extent possible, avoid subjective causes. The discrepant conditions
        noted in the audit should clearly have been able to occur as a result of the cited
        causes.
     4.4.3.3. Effect. Express effect (i.e., impact) in terms of dollars or number of deficiencies
     in a population. Do not project discrepancies, effect, or PMB if using non-statistical
     sampling. However, if using statistical sampling, state the effect in terms of projected
     errors (e.g., ―we estimate that between 800 and 1,000 of the 2,000 transactions were
     processed late‖). Further, state the effect in positive terms when possible, (e.g.,
     ―eliminating the problem will provide benefits‖) instead of negative terms (e.g., ―failure
     to correct will create further problems‖). For clear results paragraphs, provide an
     associated positive effect statement.
        4.4.3.3.1. In performance audits, reductions in efficiency and economy or shortfalls
        in obtaining program objectives are appropriate measures of effect. Express these in
        quantitative terms such as dollars, number of personnel, units of production,
        quantities of material, number of transactions, or elapsed time.
        4.4.3.3.2. Provide specific examples when possible. If you cannot ascertain the
        actual effect, you can sometimes use potential or inferred effect to show the
        significance of the condition.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       41


        4.4.3.3.3. Potential monetary benefits are reasonably measured benefits expressed as
        a dollar value that the ACP anticipates the Air Force will accrue as a result of
        implementing the report recommendations. These benefits represent the ACP’s and
        management’s best estimates or actual known benefits at report preparation time. If
        PMBs are identified, the ACP will include the dollar amount in the effect paragraph
        and state how they calculated the PMBs. Ensure the amount in the report agrees with
        the amount in the SAR statement (paragraph 4.2.3.5). Note: Coordinate PMBs with
        HQ AFAA/DOO before releasing the report to management. See AFAAI 65-103,
        Chapter 17 for comprehensive PMB guidance.
     4.4.3.4. Management Corrective Actions. When appropriate, include in the report
     significant discrepancies that management corrected during the audit along with an
     explanation of the corrective action taken and the month/year action was complete. Use
     the caption ―Management Corrective Actions‖ for these paragraphs, and be sure to verify
     the extent and status of management corrective actions. The AM must document the
     verification of management corrective action in the working paper files. If management
     merely initiated action or partially corrected the condition or cause, the AM will need to
     include recommendations to ensure the required corrective action is completed.
        4.4.3.4.1. Completed Corrective Action. The AM will report completed corrective
        actions in the SAR statement (Part I, paragraph K, ―Number of Corrective Actions
        Completed During Audit‖). A completed corrective action is defined as a completed
        action (not promised or initiated) that corrected the cited condition or cause and
        eliminated the need for a recommendation. The following is an example of typical
        actions the AM should report as corrective actions management completed during the
        audit: ―During [insert month/year], management cancelled unneeded due outs
        totaling $125 million, modified the entry-level training course by adding a section on
        how to properly perform due-out validations, and added validation criteria to the Air
        Force instruction.‖ In this example, management completed three actions which
        corrected the cited condition and addressed the cause cited in the audit results.
        4.4.3.4.2. The following example is an action that should not be reported as a
        corrective action completed during the audit: ―During the audit, management
        initiated action to obtain funding to use in correcting the vulnerabilities cited above.‖
        In this example, the action taken neither ensured management would obtain the
        funding nor correct the vulnerabilities.
     4.4.3.5. Audit Comments. Include other comments, as needed, under the caption ―Audit
     Comments.‖ For example, if the AM discovers procedural discrepancies during the audit
     that require changes to a DoD directive, include a statement that the conflict was referred
     to the Department of Defense Office of the Deputy Inspector General for Auditing
     (ODIG-AUD) for corrective action. In addition, if management actions resulted in the
     condition being partially corrected (e.g., 5 of 10 sampled items), give management credit
     for the action taken in the ―Audit Comments‖ paragraph and include a recommendation
     to address the balance of the items. This information should not be reported in the
     ―Management Corrective Actions‖ paragraph because the action is not yet complete and
     reporting partially completed action in the ―Management Corrective Actions‖ paragraph
     will cause a disparity between the SAR statement and the audit report.
42                                                             AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


     4.4.3.6. Recommendations. Recommendations should immediately follow the specific
     audit result to which they relate, in the following order: (a) recommendations to correct
     the condition, if applicable; (b) recommendations addressing the main cause identified in
     the report as well as all the contributing causes; and (c) recommendations to achieve any
     claimed PMB. Do not include a recommendation that does not address a condition,
     cause, or PMB statement. Conversely, do not list a cause or identify PMB unless the
     report includes corresponding recommendations (or completed management actions)
     addressing the cause and PMB.
        4.4.3.6.1. Administrative Requirements. Number recommendations consecutively
        within each tab. For example, if Tab A contains two recommendations, number them
        A.1. and A.2. If Tab B contains three recommendations, number them B.1., B.2., and
        B.3. Note: Each recommendation within an Air Force report of audit may have
        several actions that should be addressed as separate subparagraphs.
        4.4.3.6.2. Action Official. Identify the management position (not an individual’s
        name) responsible for taking corrective action. Do not direct recommendations
        higher than the report addressee.
        4.4.3.6.3. Special Situations. When audit reports identify possible overobligations or
        project splitting, contracting improprieties, or monies owed the Government,
        recommend actions necessary to provide a permanent fix to the root cause of the audit
        result and actions necessary to recoup any lost funds or assets.
            4.4.3.6.3.1. Overobligations or Project Splitting. Audit reports involving the
            over-obligation of current year funds or project splitting (which would have
            resulted in violation of statute if handled as one project) require a two-part
            recommendation. In Part 1, recommend the unit comptroller or another
            independent party determine whether a violation of DoD 7000.14-R, DoD
            Financial Management Regulations (FMRs), Volume 14, Administrative Control
            of Funds and Antideficiency Act Violations, occurred. In Part 2, recommend that,
            if a violation did occur, management formally investigate and report the violation
            in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R.
            4.4.3.6.3.2. Contracting Improprieties. When audit reports identify possible
            contractor fraud, include recommendations such as: ―The AF/OPR should
            determine whether the contractor should be debarred or suspended,‖ or ―The
            AF/OPR, in consultation with the Staff Judge Advocate General, should
            determine whether legal action against the contractor is appropriate.‖ In each
            case, the wording of specific recommendations will depend on the AM’s
            judgment. Although AMs must recognize that the contracting officer has final
            responsibility in dealings with contractors, auditors must consider others,
            including legal authorities.
            4.4.3.6.3.3. Monies Owed the Government. When audit reports identify monies
            owed to the government, include a recommendation to establish an account
            receivable in accordance with AFI 65-403, Follow-up on Internal Air Force Audit
            Reports, and a recommendation to recoup the amount due. The auditor will
            normally determine the amount management should recoup.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                    43


        4.4.3.6.4. Other Considerations. The relationship between recommendations and the
        condition or the causes of the condition must be clear and logical. Each
        recommendation should relate to either a cause or a condition, and conversely each
        cause should have a recommendation. In addition,
           4.4.3.6.4.1. Each recommendation may have several subparagraphs, with each
           subparagraph identifying one finite management action.
           4.4.3.6.4.2. Make recommendations that are definite and call for specific action.
           Avoid to the extent possible such words as verify, consider, perform a study,
           emphasize, and reevaluate.
           4.4.3.6.4.3. Recommend two separate actions (sub-paragraphs) if the
           management action may take an unusual length of time to complete (e.g., revising
           a directive). The first action should provide a permanent fix for the root cause of
           the deficient condition. The second action should address interim procedures to
           temporarily control the deficient condition until management implements the
           permanent fix.
        4.4.3.6.5. Addressing Recommendations. Audit reports will be staffed to no
        lower than the three-letter for SAF-level audit reports (e.g., SAF/AQC) or no
        lower than the two-letter for Air Staff, field operating agency (FOA), direct
        reporting unit (DRU), and MAJCOM audit reports (e.g., AF/A1, AFPC/CC, or
        AFMC/FM). However, recommendations may be addressed to the appropriate
        lower-level for action, provided the recommendations are addressed to officials
        at the Senior Executive Service- or General Officer-level. If you need assistance
        in determining the OPR for an Air Force Report of Audit, contact the
        appropriate SAF/AGA action officer.
        4.4.3.6.6. Determining the Report OPR. To determine the report OPR, evaluate the
        recommendations.
           4.4.3.6.6.1. If the report has one or more recommendations to HQ USAF, plus
           recommendations to only one MAJCOM, the OPR for the report will be the HQ
           USAF element with responsibility over the area that is the primary focus of the
           report. Normally, this is the HQ USAF two-digit or SAF three-digit counterpart
           to the MAJCOM element receiving the predominant number of recommendations.
           For example, if the report addresses most of the recommendations to the AFMC
           logistics community, and one recommendation to SAF/FM, the OPR would be
           AF/A4. Directorates should not normally address recommendations to a
           MAJCOM commander (i.e., AFMC/CC).
           4.4.3.6.6.2. If all the recommendations are to a single MAJCOM, the OPR would
           be the MAJCOM two-digit level that was the primary focus of the audit. Include
           the appropriate HQ USAF elements in distribution of the final report when the
           OPR is at the MAJCOM.
        4.4.3.6.7. Reporting Level. The ACP will address significant audit results requiring
        command-level corrective action in the Air Force Report of Audit.
           4.4.3.6.7.1. MAJCOM.      If the ACP determines a MAJCOM issue is more
 44                                                                AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


              appropriate for the CDA report than an installation-level report, the AM will
              advise the AAO of the need to defer the issue to the CDA report. AAOs may
              address conditions not significant enough to address in the Air Force report in an
              installation-level audit report. Note: AMs will advise applicable AAOs when
              command-level audit results excluded from installation-level reports (at the
              request of the ACP) are not subsequently included in the Air Force audit report.
              The AM will provide the rationale for not reporting so the AAO can determine the
              need for further action.
              4.4.3.6.7.2. Other Command. In instances where the Air Force has vested a
              substantial part of overall management for programs and systems in one focal
              point, include significant audit results in the Air Force-level audit report.
              Examples include a weapon system managed by a system program office, a
              commodity managed by a single item manager at an air logistics center, or a
              system managed by the Standard Systems Group. AAOs may issue installation-
              level audit reports only to report conditions noted in program and systems audits
              not significant enough to include in the Air Force report.
       4.4.3.7. Management Comments. Government auditing standards require reporting the
       views of responsible management officials. Consequently, AFAA requires management
       comments for each negative audit result (i.e., finding), recommendation, and PMB
       included in the audit report.
          4.4.3.7.1. Include management comments verbatim in the final report immediately
          following the recommendation to which the comments relate (paragraph 5.4.2). In
          the draft report, provide a paragraph caption and reserve space for the management
          comments immediately following the associated recommendation.
          4.4.3.7.2. Inclusion of management comments in clear tabs is optional. A clear tab is
          a tab that does not identify any deficient conditions. A tab that identifies deficient
          conditions but does not include any recommendations is not a clear tab and must have
          a Management Comments paragraph.
       4.4.3.8. Evaluation of Management Comments. Include an Evaluation of Management
       Comments paragraph at the end of each audit result after the Management Comments
       paragraph. In the draft report, provide a paragraph caption and reserve space for the audit
       evaluation statement (paragraph 5.4.3). Note: Do not include an Evaluation of
       Management Comments paragraph in clear tabs.
4.5. Standard Report Format—Appendices. Include the following appendices with each
report: Background Information (optional), Glossary of Acronyms (optional), Audit Scope and
Prior Audit Coverage, Locations Audited/Reports Issued, Points of Contact, and Final Report
Distribution. The following appendices may also be required on an individual basis: Interim
Report, Management Comments (final report), and Additional Management Documents (final
report). Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 14, for additional information on report appendices.
Note: For the Locations Audited/Reports Issued appendix, list each of the audited organizations
and, if a report was issued, identify the report number and date. Sort and list the locations
audited by command and unit designator. List HQ USAF and MAJCOM staff elements in
alphabetical order and units in numerical order. Ensure the scope paragraph (number of
locations audited) agrees with the listing of locations audited in this appendix.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       45


4.6. Follow-up Report Format.
   4.6.1. Report Title. The title of follow-up audit reports should read ―Follow-up Audit—
   (name of original report).‖
   4.6.2. Executive Summary.
      4.6.2.1. Introduction. Use the introduction paragraph to reference the prior report (cite
      project number, title, and date) and to provide background information as necessary to
      help the reader understand the specific audit results and PMB contained in the prior audit
      report and the reasons the issues were selected for follow up.
      4.6.2.2. Objectives. Use the objectives paragraph to explain the purpose of the follow-up
      audit and identify the recommendations reviewed.
      4.6.2.3. Conclusions. Use the conclusions paragraph to identify all conditions that
      management effectively corrected since the prior audit. Also, clearly identify any repeat
      conditions and benefits (monetary or non-monetary) lost because management did not
      take action or action taken was not adequate to correct the problem. Clearly state the
      amount of PMB validated. Also, indicate which recommendations management did not
      complete corrective action on since the prior audit, if applicable, and explain the reasons
      management did not complete actions.
      4.6.2.4. Recommendations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 4.3.4
      4.6.2.5. Management’s Response. Follow the guidance in paragraph 4.3.5
   4.6.3. Audit Results Tabs. Generally follow the guidance in paragraph 4.4 for preparing the
   audit results tab. When disclosing the following conditions as a result of follow up, take the
   action indicated.
      4.6.3.1. Deficiency Remains.
          4.6.3.1.1. Management Actions Adequate.       If management implemented the
          recommendations or took appropriate actions, but the deficiency remains, give
          management credit for taking appropriate action and identify the reasons why the
          problem remains uncorrected.
          4.6.3.1.2. Management Actions Not Adequate. Identify the specific audit results
          from the prior report for which management actions were not adequate. Explain why
          management actions were not adequate and why the deficiency remains.
      4.6.3.2. Deficiencies Corrected. Issue a clear follow-up report when management took
      appropriate action and corrected the deficiencies and the AM identified no additional
      issues.
      4.6.3.3. New Deficiencies. The following guidance applies when the AM identifies new
      conditions during the follow-up audit.
          4.6.3.3.1. If the new conditions relate to the follow-up issues, then include the new
          conditions in the follow-up audit report (in a separate tab). If applicable, claim PMB
          for the new results and recommendations.
          4.6.3.3.2. If the new conditions are not related to the follow-up issues, include the
          new conditions in a separate report and establish a new project number in the AFAA
 46                                                                 AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


          MIS for the report. Expand audit work under the new project number if necessary to
          ensure a complete and accurate evaluation.
      4.6.3.4. Repeat Audit Results. Identify audit results as ―repeat‖ if the current condition
      is substantially the same as disclosed in the prior report. Identify audit results as ―repeat‖
      whether or not the cause of the current condition is the same as in the prior report.
   4.6.4. Report Appendices. Follow the guidance for report appendices in AFAAI 65-103,
   Chapter 14.
4.7. Interim Report Format. Write interim reports using the memorandum format described
below and the template located on the AFAA Home CoP.
   4.7.1. Introduction. Include an introductory paragraph that explains the need for an interim
   report, why the audit was accomplished, and the significance of the audited area.
   4.7.2. Audit Objectives. Briefly address the audit’s overall objective and subobjectives. The
   report’s objectives should be similar to, or the same as, the audit announcement
   memorandum’s objectives.
   4.7.3. Synopsis (Optional). The synopsis paragraph is optional; however, AMs are
   encouraged to include a synopsis in reports containing multiple findings or one long,
   complex finding. If included, the synopsis will briefly summarize findings in the same order
   as they are discussed in the report.
   4.7.4. Background (Optional). Include information in the background paragraph that
   potential readers need to understand the audit results. Provide other background information,
   as appropriate, and the criteria used to conduct the audit in the Audit Methodology and
   Disclosure attachment (paragraph 4.7.8).
   4.7.5. Audit Results. Number and title each audit result, and include the following captioned
   paragraphs: condition, cause, effect, recommendations, management comments, and
   evaluation of management comments. If applicable, include captioned paragraphs for
   management corrective actions and other audit comments. Follow the guidance for standard
   reports (paragraph 4.4).
   4.7.6. Discussion With Responsible Officials. In the interim report, include a paragraph
   stating with whom (by position title and organization) the AM discussed or coordinated the
   report. In the final report, indicate the date the ACP received management’s written
   comments.
   4.7.7. Points of Contact. Identify members of the ACP, offices that received the interim
   report, and AFAA MIS project number under which the audit was conducted.
   4.7.8. Audit Methodology and Disclosure Attachment. Include the following mandatory
   paragraphs: (a) Criteria, (b) Audit Scope, (c) Prior Audit Coverage, and (d) Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA). Additional details pertaining to these sections can be found in
   AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 14.
      4.7.8.1. Criteria. Identify the criteria used to perform the audit.
      4.7.8.2. Audit Scope. Include the following paragraphs: audit coverage, sampling
      methodology (detailing sampling and CAATTS), data reliability, and auditing standards.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       47


       4.7.8.3. Prior Audit Coverage. Identify prior audits in the prior audit coverage section
       that required follow-up work. If there were no audits with similar objectives that
       required follow-up work, so state.
       4.7.8.4. Freedom of Information Act.          Advise all report recipients as to the
       disclosure/denial authority by including the FOIA statement.
   4.7.9. Administrative Elements. Process interim reports the same way as regular draft
   reports (i.e., through HQ AFAA/DOO and SAF/AGA).
       4.7.9.1. Send quick-reaction reports to management with a 15calendar day suspense.
       Send preliminary reports to management with a 30calendar day suspense. Assign a
       separate project number to the interim report. Attach a SAR statement (paragraph
       4.2.3.5) to the transmittal memorandum.
       4.7.9.2. Include a synopsis or summary of the interim report in the Air Force Report of
       Audit, together with an explanation of management action taken or initiated. Include the
       interim report as an appendix to the Air Force Report of Audit and list the interim report
       in the Locations Audited/Reports Issued appendix.
Section B – Report Quality Assurance
4.8. General. Air Force audit reports must meet generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS) and AFAA reporting standards. To aid in meeting these standards, AFAA
uses the quality assurance procedures of cross-referencing and independent referencing to verify
reports are accurate and supported by sufficient, appropriate documentary evidence. These
quality assurance procedures, described below, apply to all draft reports.
4.9. Cross Referencing. The AM will hyperlink (cross reference) the approved draft report and
SAR statement to the working papers. Hyperlink to the specific point in the working papers
where the support is located. When preparing working papers manually, cross reference the draft
report by adding a comment describing where supporting information can be found and, in the
manual working paper margins, cross-reference to the associated report paragraph.
   4.9.1. The AM will hyperlink the draft report and SAR statement to the findings (i.e.,
   TeamMate ―exceptions‖ or ―issues‖) within the electronic working papers. The AM should
   already have cross referenced from the findings to the procedure steps (detail) and from there
   to the AAO submissions (CDAP Response Sheets) or other supporting working papers.
   Note: Cross referencing directly from the report to the supporting working papers should
   normally occur only when the referenced information is not in a finding.
   4.9.2. The AM should only cross reference the draft report once. Normally, the AM should
   cross reference the AAG-approved draft that will be issued to management for comment. If
   the AM cross references an earlier draft, the AM must also cross reference any subsequent
   changes in the AAG-approved draft report.
   4.9.3. Except as noted in paragraph 4.9.4, the AM will cross reference all reported figures,
   dates, direct quotations, statements of fact, and assertions. Examples of items the AM should
   cross reference include: positive statements in the executive summary, statements of fact in
   the background section, causes for audit results, management corrective actions (actions
   management took during the audit to correct audit-identified deficiencies), scope
   information, the data reliability statement, and internal control assessments.
 48                                                                  AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


   4.9.4. It is not necessary to cross reference (hyperlink) repeated information more than once.
   For example, the AM does not have to hyperlink information contained in the executive
   summary that is repeated in the body of the report if the same information is already cross
   referenced to working paper support. Instead, statements in the executive summary and
   synopsis paragraph(s) should be linked to the detailed audit results to verify information is
   consistently presented. Further, if an audit result in a report is fully supported by a finding in
   the working papers (with all required elements of a finding included), one hyperlink to the
   finding is sufficient, as long as the finding is appropriately hyperlinked to the procedure
   step(s) and applicable supporting working paper(s).
   4.9.5. When cross referencing is complete, any reviewer should be able, without AM
   assistance, to follow the referencing trail from the report to the working paper support. The
   working papers should stand on their own.
4.10. Independent Referencing. Referencing is an independent review of the draft report and
working paper files by a person not associated with the audit to verify the report is accurate and
documentary evidence supports audit assertions, conclusions, and specific statements of fact.
   4.10.1. When to Reference. Independently reference the AAG-approved draft report before
   releasing the report for comment. Earlier referencing will require the implementation of
   strong controls to ensure subsequent changes to the report are re-referenced before the report
   is released or discussed with management.
   4.10.2. Selecting the Referencer. The AAG, or the AAG’s designated representative, will
   select the referencer for each project. To maintain independence and objectivity, the
   referencer should be from a different division. Normally, the referencer will be another AM.
   At geographically separated CDA locations, if it is not feasible to transfer the working papers
   back to the directorate for referencing, it may be necessary to have an experienced
   journeyman auditor perform the referencing (with the AAO chief’s approval).
   4.10.3. Referencer’s Role. The referencer’s role is not to perform a supervisory review but,
   rather, to ascertain the report is adequately supported by sufficient, appropriate evidence.
   The AM will provide all possible assistance in locating material and should be accessible for
   explanations (any oral explanations provided should be added to the working papers).
   Referencers may request additional evidence or clarification they consider necessary to
   support the audit results. Disagreements between the referencer and AM should be elevated
   to the PM. If the disagreement still cannot be resolved, it should be elevated to the AD.
   After deliberation, if the AD does not agree with the referencer’s position, the AD should
   insert a statement within the applicable coaching note assuming responsibility for the
   adequacy of the support.
   4.10.4. Independent Referencer Checklist. Referencers are encouraged, but not required, to
   use the Independent Referencer Checklist on the AFAA Home CoP as an aid in completing
   the referencing assignment. If used, the independent referencer should include a coaching
   note in the Independent Referencer Checklist, which will then get automatically linked (via
   the coaching note) into the TeamMate-generated Independent Referencer Review Record.
   Note: The Independent Referencer Checklist and Independent Referencer Review Record
   should be filed in the ―Independent Reference‖ folder.
   4.10.5. Referencing Responsibilities.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       49


     4.10.5.1. Independent Referencer. The independent referencer will:
        4.10.5.1.1. Before starting any work related to referencing the assigned project,
        document their independence from the project in their first TeamMate coaching note
        as follows: ―I certify that I am independent on this project and have not worked on it
        prior to being assigned as independent referencer.‖
        4.10.5.1.2. To verify information is consistent and supported, trace all figures, dates,
        direct quotations, statements of fact, and AM assertions from the hyperlinked (cross-
        referenced) draft report and SAR statement through the finding to the procedure step
        to the supporting working papers. Note: If the referencer encounters items the AM
        did not hyperlink, the referencer will return the report and working papers to the AM
        to finish hyperlinking. The referencer will not omit items from the verification
        process because the AM did not completely hyperlink the report.
        4.10.5.1.3. Place an independent referencer mark next to each figure and statement of
        fact verified in the report and next to the supporting evidence in the associated
        working papers.
        4.10.5.1.4. Verify the mathematical accuracy of tables, charts, figures, and schedules
        included in the report.
        4.10.5.1.5. Be alert to statements in the report which seem illogical or lack clarity. If
        the referencer does not understand what the auditor is trying to say, there is a good
        chance management will not understand either.
        4.10.5.1.6. Ensure the PM has reviewed all working papers and cleared the
        TeamMate coaching notes. The independent referencer will not complete the
        Referencing Certification (reference paragraph 4.10.6) until the PM has finished
        reviewing and signed off on all working papers.
        4.10.5.1.7. Create coaching notes in TeamMate along with the optional Independent
        Referencer Checklist to document all comments, questions, and opinions pertaining to
        the review.
        4.10.5.1.8. Charge all time referencing the subject report to the project within AFAA
        MIS.
     4.10.5.2. Audit Manager. The AM will:
        4.10.5.2.1. Cross reference the AAG-approved draft report in accordance with
        paragraph 4.9
        4.10.5.2.2. Respond to each independent referencer coaching note. The AM will add
        additional support to the working papers, correct the cross references, change the
        draft report, or provide explanatory comments, as required.
        4.10.5.2.3. Elevate points on which there is disagreement to the PM for review.
        4.10.5.2.4. Notify the PM when making significant changes to the report after the
        report has been independently referenced. Also, cross reference all subsequent report
        changes to the working paper support.
50                                                               AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


        4.10.5.2.5. Retain the independently referenced draft report, the TeamMate-
        generated Independent Referencer Review Record, and the Independent Referencer
        Checklist (if used) in the ―Independent Reference‖ folder.
        4.10.5.2.6. Assure receipt of written statements (normally e-mails) from each
        application-site team chief certifying the draft report and CDAP Response Sheet
        submissions were independently referenced. Retain all certification statements in the
        working paper files. Reference AFAAI 65-101 (Chapters 3 and 4) and AFAAI 65-
        103, Chapter 4.
     4.10.5.3. Program Manager. The PM will:
        4.10.5.3.1. Review all project working papers and draft reports for technical accuracy
        and consistency before the draft report is independently referenced.
        4.10.5.3.2. Review the independent referencer’s TeamMate coaching notes, verify
        changes in the report resulting from the referencing review, and resolve any
        disagreements between the referencer and the AM. If disagreements cannot be
        resolved by the PM, elevate the issue to the AD for consideration.
        4.10.5.3.3. After the report has been independently referenced, notify the AD when
        there are significant changes to the report.
     4.10.5.4. Associate Director. The AD will:
        4.10.5.4.1. Confirm the report is logically sound and the opinions, conclusions, and
        recommendations are reasonable, material, and consistent with the factual
        information presented.
        4.10.5.4.2. Review the independent referencer’s comments and the AM responses;
        resolve any remaining disagreements; and verify the independent referencer and PM
        attested to the satisfactory completion of the independent referencing process. Note:
        The AD is the final decision authority for any disagreements between the independent
        referencer and the AM/PM.
        4.10.5.4.3. Notify the AAG in writing (e-mail is acceptable) when the report has
        been independently referenced. Provide a copy of the communication to the AM for
        inclusion in the working papers.
        4.10.5.4.4. Ensure all subsequent significant changes to the report are independently
        referenced in accordance with paragraph 4.10.7
     4.10.5.5. AAG. The AAG will ensure all draft reports are independently referenced
     before submitting them to SAF/AGA for release to management.
  4.10.6. Referencing Certification. Once independent referencing is complete and the AM
  has resolved any discrepancies or issues:
     4.10.6.1. The independent referencer will then attest to the satisfactory completion of all
     suggestions and/or comments noted during the review. This should be the independent
     referencer’s last TeamMate coaching note.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                        51


       4.10.6.2. The PM will respond to the final independent referencer coaching note
       (paragraph 4.10.6.1) attesting to the satisfactory completion of the independent
       referencing process.
   4.10.7. Re-referencing. If, after initial referencing, the CDA team makes significant changes
   to the report, the AAG, or the AAG’s designated representative, must select an independent
   person to re-reference the changed or added material. Significant changes include changes in
   scope (e.g., audit universe or sample size), changes in condition (e.g., differences in number,
   location, or amounts of deficiencies), new or changed examples, and any statements added to
   report management corrective actions.
4.11. Directorate Review and Evaluation.
   4.11.1. Review Levels. There are three levels of review for each Air Force report.
       4.11.1.1. First-Level Review. The PM is the first-level report reviewer. The PM is
       responsible for the report’s technical accuracy and providing guidance on report writing
       to the AM.
       4.11.1.2. Second-Level Review. The AD is the second-level report reviewer. The AD is
       responsible for report logic, technical soundness and balance, and the adequacy of
       recommendations.
       4.11.1.3. Third-Level Review. The AAG is the third-level report reviewer. The AAG
       reviews and evaluates reports to verify they meet AFAA reporting standards and policies.
   4.11.2. Report Reviews. In reviewing draft reports, reviewers should evaluate such things
   as: clarity and conciseness, focus and flow, materiality and support for audit results,
   appropriate use of examples, proper perspective and balance, adequacy of recommendations,
   correctness of grammar and format, and accuracy of potential monetary benefits. The AFAA
   Home CoP contains an optional CDA report review checklist to aid in reviewing reports.
   The ACP can use the checklist as an internal quality control when preparing and reviewing
   draft reports.
   4.11.3. Documentation Requirements. The AM will maintain a chronological outline of
   events, from preparation of the draft report until issuance of the final report, to record all
   changes, reviews, contacts with AFAA elements, and contacts with Air Force officials in a
   clearly traceable manner. The AFAA Home CoP includes a template for use in tracking draft
   report progress.
Section C – Draft Report Processing
4.12. Draft Report Distribution.
   4.12.1. Draft Report Discussions. Before forwarding the draft report package to SAF/AGA
   for release to management, the AM and PM will:
       4.12.1.1. Discuss audit results with the management OPR and OCRs. SAF/AGA will
       not release draft reports until the AM and PM brief senior Air Force management. Note:
       When report discussions result in unresolved disagreements and the report package is
       forwarded to SAF/AGA for release, the AM will advise the SAF/AGA action officer of
       the details so he or she may provide closer monitoring during comment processing.
52                                                              AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


     4.12.1.2. Ensure the report is a clean copy free of prior versions (if using the MS Word
     versions feature), track change markings, and editorial comments. Having review
     comments embedded in the draft sent to management for comment could be embarrassing
     for AFAA.
  4.12.2. Draft Report Package. The draft report package consists of the OPR memorandum,
  draft report, and SAR statement. The ACP prepares the package and forwards it through the
  AAG to SAF/AGA and HQ AFAA/DOO. SAF/AGA personnel forward the draft report
  package to management for comment. Requirements for the draft report package are detailed
  below. Note: Mail classified reports in accordance with DoD 5200.1R, Information Security
  Program, Chapter 7, Section 2, and AFAAI 65103, Chapter 5.
     4.12.2.1. OPR Memorandum. The OPR memorandum is addressed to the HQ USAF or
     MAJCOM OPR and OCRs, briefly summarizes the audit results, and requests
     management comments. Also, the OPR memorandum should identify management
     officials contacted. The OPR memorandum includes three attachments: report
     processing procedures (inserted by SAF/AGA), draft report, and SAR statement. The
     ACP prepares the OPR memorandum for AAG signature. An OPR memorandum
     template is on the AFAA Home CoP. The ACP sends the OPR memorandum and
     attachments concurrently to SAF/AGA and HQ AFAA/DOO. Note: The ACP will not
     date the OPR memorandum or establish suspense dates for management comments.
     SAF/AGA personnel date the memorandum and enter the suspense date for management
     comments when they send the draft report to management for comments.
         4.12.2.1.1. Report Processing Procedures. AFI 65-301, Attachment 2, provides
         management personnel specific procedures to follow in answering the report.
         4.12.2.1.2. Draft Report. The draft report will conform to the guidelines established
         in paragraphs 4.1 through 4.7 Any deviation from the prescribed format requires
         AAG approval.
         4.12.2.1.3. SAR Statement. Prepare the SAR in accordance with the guidelines
         established in paragraph 4.2.3.5 and AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 17.
     4.12.2.2. Draft Report Reviews. SAF/AGA and HQ AFAA/DOO receive the OPR
     memorandum from the ACP and take the following actions:
         4.12.2.2.1. SAF/AGA performs a ―quick look‖ to ensure the OPR memorandum and
         draft report recommendations are appropriately and accurately addressed.
         4.12.2.2.2. HQ AFAA/DOO performs a ―quick look‖ to ensure the audit objectives
         reconcile to the conclusions; calculations are accurate; each audit result includes a
         condition, cause, and effect; and each cause has a corresponding recommendation.
     4.12.2.2. 3. Once the quick looks are satisfactorily completed, SAF/AGA issues the
     draft report to management for comment. Concurrently, HQ AFAA/DOO performs a
     more thorough review of the report and SAR statement and then forwards to SAF/AG for
     review.
  4.12.3. Air Staff and Secretariat Distribution Procedures. After receipt of the draft report
  package from the ACP, SAF/AGA personnel will date the OPR memorandum and establish
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                          53


   the suspense date for management comments. SAF/AGA will distribute the draft report,
   including the report processing procedures, to the OPR and each OCR.
       4.12.3.1. Reports Without Recommendations. SAF/AGA will establish a 15-day
       suspense for oral comments and a 30-day suspense for written comments.
       4.12.3.2. Reports With Recommendations. SAF/AGA will establish a 30-day suspense
       for receipt of all management comments.
       4.12.3.3. SAF/AGA will e-mail notification of the release date and management
       comment due date to HQ AFAA/DOO for tracking purposes. For reports with audit
       results and recommendations addressed to non-Air Force activities (e.g., the Defense
       Finance and Accounting Service), SAF/AGA will process the report through ODIG-AUD
       (paragraph 4.12.5).
       4.12.3.4. SAF/AGA, in coordination with the AM, will contact the management OPR no
       later than 15 days after the draft report is released to determine if any problems exist with
       the report or in meeting the suspense date.
       4.12.3.5. When resolving management concerns with a report, the AM and PM should
       arrange to meet with the OPR (either in person or by teleconference) to discuss the
       concerns. The SAF/AGA action officer should join the discussions, if practical.
   4.12.4. Applying AAO and MAJCOM Distribution Procedures. After SAF/AGA formally
   releases the draft report to management, the AM will e-mail the draft report to each
   participating team chief and affected MAJCOM representative. In the e-mail, the AM will
   include a statement that the AAG approved the subject report for release.
       4.12.4.1. MAJCOM representatives will forward the report to the command audit focal
       point with instructions informing command personnel how they may formally comment
       on the draft report to the HQ USAF OPR for consideration in preparing the coordinated
       response to AFAA.
       4.12.4.2. Team chiefs will review the draft report for accuracy of any data that applies to
       their location. In addition, team chiefs will forward the report to the applicable local
       audit focal point with instructions informing the commander that he or she may formally
       comment on the draft report through applicable command channels to the HQ USAF
       OPR for consideration in preparing the coordinated response to AFAA.
   4.12.5. Reports Involving Non-Air Force Activities. Process reports involving non-Air
   Force activities through ODIG-AUD for review and approval before release to management.
   Email the AAG-approved draft report to SAF/AGA (copy to HQ AFAA/DOO), and
   SAF/AGA will send the report to ODIG-AUD. ODIG-AUD will release the report to
   applicable DoD management and, if applicable, advise SAF/AGA to release the Air Force
   report to Air Force management.
4.13. Extension of Suspense Dates. Management may require additional time to respond to an
audit report because of the scope and complexity of recommendations. All extension requests
should go through the SAF/AGA action officer. If the OPR requests an extension directly from
the ACP, the ACP will route the request back through SAF/AGA. DoD organizations will
coordinate extension requests with SAF/AGA through ODIG-AUD.
54                                                              AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


  4.13.1. Request for Extension. The HQ USAF OPR may orally request an extension up to
  15 days from the original suspense date. The HQ USAF OPR should provide written
  rationale (e-mail is acceptable) for requests exceeding 15 days. SAF/AGA will notify the
  ACP of the extension request and the OPR’s reason for the extension. The ACP will review
  and evaluate the request and respond in writing (e-mail is acceptable) to the SAF/AGA action
  officer within 2 workdays of the request. The ACP may grant extensions up to 30 days from
  the original date.
  4.13.2. Extension Approval. If the ACP approves the request, the SAF/AGA action officer
  will officially notify the OPR/OCRs and provide the revised suspense date. SAF/AGA may
  orally grant extensions of 15 days or less. Written approval applies when the extension
  request exceeds 15 days beyond the original suspense date. SAF/AGA will notify HQ
  AFAA/DOO of all approved extensions.
  4.13.3. Management Comments Not Received. For management comments not received by
  the 60-day point, the ACP should coordinate further action with SAF/AGA and provide
  SAF/AGA a copy of the report chronology (paragraph 4.11.3). Specifically,
     4.13.3.1. SAF/AGA, in coordination with the ACP, is responsible for management
     comment follow-up. If management comments are not received within 60 days, the
     SAF/AGA action officer will contact the ACP weekly and discuss (a) the problems
     encountered, (b) ACP involvement, (c) the potential for resolution, and (d) the estimated
     date to receive signed comments.
     4.13.3.2. If management comments are not received within 75 days or will exceed 75
     days with an extension, the SAF/AGA action officer will recommend HQ AFAA/DO
     involvement, if appropriate.
     4.13.3.3. If management comments are not received within 90 days or will exceed 90
     days with an extension, the SAF/AGA action officer will recommend SAF/AG
     involvement, if appropriate.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                       55


                                          Chapter 5

                                      FINAL REPORT

5.1. Overview. The ACP prepares the final audit report after receiving and evaluating
management comments on the draft report. Final audit reports include the views of responsible
management officials as a means of verifying the report’s fairness, completeness, and
objectivity. This chapter provides policy and procedures for receiving and evaluating
management comments, processing nonconcurrences or comments deemed insufficient or
nonresponsive, and preparing the final report package.
5.2. Receiving and Evaluating Management Comments. The following paragraphs describe
the procedures for receiving, evaluating, and processing management comments.
   5.2.1. Receipt of Management Comments.           The ACP and SAF/AGA will ensure
   management comments meet the requirements specified in AFI 65-301, Chapter 1.
   Specifically, they will ensure management comments (a) indicate concurrence or
   nonconcurrence with each audit result, recommendation, and PMB, regardless of amount; (b)
   indicate the actions management will take to correct the conditions identified in the report;
   (c) provide actual or estimated completion dates for all agreed-to actions; and (d) provide
   rationale for any disagreements.
       5.2.1.1. Reports With Recommendations. SAF/AGA receives fully coordinated, signed
       management comments from the OPR, assesses the responsiveness of the comments
       (cold reader perspective), and electronically transmits its assessment and the comments to
       the ACP for evaluation. SAF/AGA will also provide the date management comments
       were received to HQ AFAA/DOO for tracking purposes.
       5.2.1.2. Reports Without Recommendations.          For reports that do not contain
       recommendations, SAF/AGA will obtain an oral or e-mail response from the Air Force
       OPR indicating acceptance or rejection of the report. For oral responses, SAF/AGA will
       prepare a memorandum for record of the discussion, and forward a copy to the ACP. For
       e-mail responses, SAF/AGA will forward the e-mail to the ACP. SAF/AGA will also
       provide the date management’s response was received to HQ AFAA/DOO for tracking
       purposes.
   5.2.2. Evaluating Management Comments. Within 5 workdays of receiving management
   comments, the ACP will assess whether the comments adequately address the issues
   contained in the report and submit the evaluation for approval to the applicable AAG.
   Reference AFAAI 65103, Chapter 15 for guidance on evaluating management comments.
   Also, if management comments are considered a nonconcurrence, follow the guidance in
   AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 15, and AFI 65-301, Chapter 3.
   5.2.3. Processing Management Comments. After the AAG approves the evaluation of
   management comments, the ACP provides the evaluation to SAF/AGA. SAF/AGA
   processes the evaluation to SAF/AG for review and approval. After SAF/AG approval,
   SAF/AGA sends the ACP the SAF/AG approval and notifies HQ AFAA/DOO of the
   approval date.
 56                                                                AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


   5.2.4. Management Comments Not Received. If management does not provide comments
   addressing all report issues by the revised due date (not to exceed 60 calendar days from the
   date of issuance), the ACP, in coordination with SAF/AGA, will contact the Air Force action
   officer weekly to discuss (a) problems encountered, (b) the potential for resolution, and (c)
   the estimated date to receive signed comments. HQ AFAA/DO may get involved after 75
   days and SAF/AG may get involved after 90 days to resolve problems with delayed receipt.
   After 90 days, follow the procedures in paragraph 5.3
5.3. Processing Nonconcurrences. If the ACP cannot resolve nonconcurrences, comments are
deemed insufficient or nonresponsive, or management does not provide comments:
   5.3.1. The appropriate AAG, with SAF/AG approval, will elevate the issue to AF/CVA or
   the appropriate Assistant Secretary for possible resolution. The AAG will provide SAF/AG
   an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, with five tab attachments: (a) proposed SAF/AG
   memorandum advising AF/CVA or the appropriate Assistant Secretary of the
   nonconcurrence and/or insufficient or nonresponsive comments; (b) draft audit report; (c)
   management comments; (d) proposed evaluation of management comments; and (e)
   chronology of discussions/attempts to resolve the issues. Process the AF Form 1768 through
   SAF/AGA and provide a copy to HQ AFAA/DOO.
   5.3.2. If elevating the report does not resolve the issues in dispute, the ACP will prepare and
   distribute the final report with the nonconcurrence and/or insufficient or nonresponsive
   management comments and audit rebuttal inserted. SAF/FMP will submit the final report
   with unresolved issues to the Under Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/US) for final resolution
   in accordance with AFI 65-301.
5.4. Preparing the Final Report. The instructions below provide guidance for preparing the
final report.
   5.4.1. Cover Page. The final report cover page identifies the report title and report number.
   The report cover page template can be found on the AFAA Home CoP.
   5.4.2. Incorporating Management Comments. Place the management comments verbatim in
   the report immediately after the related recommendation (paragraph 4.4.3.7). Include the
   estimated completion date for planned actions or, if the management comments indicate the
   recommended actions have already been completed, insert the actual completion date, and
   ―CLOSED.‖
      5.4.2.1. Audit Results With Recommendations. Begin each management comment
      paragraph by stating whether management concurred or nonconcurred with the
      recommendation and follow with the verbatim comments (e.g., AF/A1 concurred and
      stated, ―. . .‖). Note: Correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors; however, be
      extremely careful not to change the meaning or intent of the management comments.
      Also, define acronyms if not defined elsewhere in the report.
      5.4.2.2. Audit Results Without Recommendations. If the audit result does not contain a
      recommendation because management corrected the problem during the audit, place the
      management comments paragraph after the Management Corrective Actions paragraph.
      5.4.2.3. Clear Tabs. Management Comments paragraphs are optional in clear tabs. If
      included, make the Management Comments paragraph the last paragraph in the tab.
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                         57


       5.4.2.4. Lengthy Management Comments. At the discretion of the AD, paraphrase
       lengthy management comments in the audit results section and include the full text as a
       report appendix. Direct the reader to the Management Comments appendix by reference
       in the audit results section, and place the appendix before the Audit Scope and Prior
       Audit Coverage appendix.
       5.4.2.5. Documents Provided With Management Comments. Management may attach
       copies of various documents, memorandums, directives, etc., to their response. If in the
       AD’s opinion the documents add to the reader’s understanding of the issues contained in
       the report, the AM will include the documents in the report as an appendix. Otherwise,
       the AM will incorporate these supporting documents into the audit report by reference
       only and file the documents in the working papers. When included as a report appendix,
       place the Additional Management Documents appendix before the Audit Scope and Prior
       Audit Coverage appendix.
       5.4.2.6. Non-Receipt of Management Comments. If management does not provide
       comments by the extended due date and SAF/AG decides to publish the report without
       comments, eliminate the ―Evaluation of Management Comments‖ section. In the
       ―Management Comments‖ paragraph, state that management did not provide comments,
       specify the original and extended due dates, and indicate that AFAA will evaluate any
       comments received within 30 days. If management does not provide comments within 30
       days, enter the report into the resolution process (see paragraph 5.3).
       5.4.2.7. Estimated Completion Dates. Management comments must contain an estimated
       completion date for each recommendation; however, the date must not occur before the
       final report’s anticipated issue date. For planning purposes, the final report issue date is
       normally about 45 calendar days after the AAG submits the final report package to HQ
       AFAA/DOO for printing. If there is any question, coordinate with the HQ USAF action
       officer and either extend the estimated completion date past the anticipated issue date of
       the final report or, if applicable, show the action as closed. Document the discussion in a
       working paper and place it in the project files.
   5.4.3. Incorporating the Evaluation of Management Comments. Include the AAG-approved
   evaluation of management comments in the executive summary and at the end of each
   numbered audit result in the report tabs (paragraphs 4.3.5 and 4.4.3.8).
       5.4.3.1. Executive Summary. Indicate whether management agreed with the audit
       results, recommendations, and PMB included in the report. Also, indicate whether

AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                        59


  5.6.1. Survey Recipients. The AAG, with input from the ACP, will select and identify
  survey recipients. Recipients should consist of recommendation addressees plus any others
  the AAG deems necessary. For reports without recommendations, send the survey to the
  process owners (normally three-letter HQ USAF officials and two-letter MAJCOM officials).
  5.6.2. Survey Suspense and Distribution. The AAG (or designee) sends the customer survey
  questionnaire directly to the selected recipients (normally via e-mail). The AAG determines
  when to send the survey questionnaire (e.g., after receipt of management comments) and may
  optionally establish a suspense date for return of the completed questionnaire.
  5.6.3. Survey Tracking. The AFAA Executive Council Advisor will maintain a record of
  survey forms sent out and returned but will not normally follow up on unanswered surveys.
  5.6.4. Survey Follow Up. The PM should investigate and respond to the customer for all
  questions receiving a score of ―1‖ and others the AD deems necessary. The working paper
  folder should contain a summary of any customer interaction.
  5.6.5. Survey Results. The AFAA Executive Council Advisor will compute survey
  statistics, summarize the data for Executive Council members, and post the information on
  the AFAA Home CoP. The Executive Council Advisor, at regularly scheduled meetings,
  will review survey summary data and initiate any action the Council directs.
  5.6.6. Action Plans. The directorates will review the survey results and develop
  organizational issues, as appropriate. Based on the identified issues, directorates will prepare
  action plans, including taskings and assignments, addressing the directorate-unique issues.
  Upon request, directorates will brief their action plans to the Executive Council. The
  Executive Council will approve action plan elements that involve AFAA-wide issues and
  make appropriate assignments and taskings to the directorates on AFAA-wide issues.
  5.6.7. Customer Feedback. After assigned actions are completed, process changes and
  outcomes will be provided to the HQ USAF-level and MAJCOM customers. Specifically,
  the AD should provide feedback to HQ USAF-level customers, and MAJCOM
  representatives should provide feedback to MAJCOM-level customers.

                                         Chapter 6

        MONITORING MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND AUDIT FOLLOW UP

6.1. Overview. This chapter explains responsibilities and procedures for monitoring
management corrective actions and following up on Air Force-level audit recommendations.
6.2. Monitoring Management Actions. Air Force managers are responsible for tracking and
monitoring the status of agreed-upon corrective actions to comply with audit recommendations.
Air Force managers must also verify management actions are timely and adequate. Monitoring
and tracking procedures are prescribed in AFI 65-403.
   6.2.1. Tracking Summaries. After completing an audit report, the ACP prepares and sends a
   separate tracking summary for each numbered recommendation to HQ AFAA/DOO with the
   final report package (paragraph 5.5.1.2). Each tracking summary includes the audit result,
   recommendation, management comments, and the actual or estimated completion date of
   management’s corrective actions.
       6.2.1.1. HQ AFAA/DOO reviews the tracking summaries for completeness and accuracy
       and sends them to SAF/FMPA with the final report. HQ AFAA/DOO also distributes
       tracking summaries to internal and external customers as needed.
       6.2.1.2. SAF/FMPA works with management to update the status of open
       recommendations and tracks management’s implementation of the agreed-to corrective
       actions in accordance with AFI 65-403, Chapter 2.
          6.2.1.2.1. To determine the status of management actions on open recommendations,
          the ACP should contact SAF/FMPA. Upon request, SAF/FMPA will provide the
          current status and updated tracking summaries for specific report recommendations.
          6.2.1.2.2. When management indicates it has completed all required actions in the
          report, SAF/FMPA obtains management’s explicit written and signed confirmation
          that all agreed-on corrective actions are complete, closes the recommendation, and
          prepares a final tracking sheet. SAF/FMPA provides the final tracking sheet to HQ
          AFAA/DOO. In turn, HQ AFAA/DOO provides a copy of the final tracking sheet to
          the ACP. The ACP should retain tracking summaries for possible future use in
          planning follow-up audits.
          6.2.1.2.3. If the ACP does not agree with SAF/FMPA’s decision to close a
          recommendation, the AD or PM should contact SAF/FMPA within 30 days, request
          the recommendation be left open, and provide rationale for not closing the
          recommendation.
   6.2.2. SAF/FMPA Procedures. SAF/FMPA uses the tracking summaries to evaluate Air
   Force management corrective actions on audit recommendations and realized PMB.
   SAF/FMPA brings any discrepancies disclosed in the updated or final tracking summaries to
   the attention of senior Air Force management officials.
       6.2.2.1. If Air Force management does not meet the estimated completion date,
       inappropriately closes recommendations, or completes actions inconsistent with the
       recommendation, SAF/FMPA will ask management for additional information and
AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012                                                                        61


      justification. If SAF/FMPA personnel agree, they will update the files with the additional
      information and/or a new estimated completion date.
      6.2.2.2. In some cases, SAF/FMPA may request AFAA to review and comment on
      management actions before closure. When SAF/FMPA requests AFAA assistance, the
      AD or PM should review management statements of actions taken, and report on the
      impact those actions may have on Air Force operations and PMB.
      6.2.2.3. SAF/FMPA will close the recommendation when management indicates it has
      completed all agreed-to corrective actions.
      6.2.2.4. SAF/FMPA prepares the consolidated Air Force Follow-up Status Report (RCS:
      DD-IG[SA]1574) based on tracking summaries and status reports received from
      MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU follow-up focal points.
6.3. Follow-up Audits. AFAA will periodically accomplish follow-up audits (AFAAI 65-103,
Chapter 10). Auditors may perform follow-up as a separate audit or concurrently with other
related audit applications.
   6.3.1. Follow-up Audit Selection. ADs should maintain a proper balance between follow-up
   audits and new audits and base their selection on the relative importance of the
   recommendations. The AD should select recommendations with:
      6.3.1.1. PMB over $5 million.
      6.3.1.2. Major changes to policies, concepts, and procedures.
      6.3.1.3. High priority issues of major current significance in the Air Force.
   6.3.2. Follow-up Audit Procedures. Follow-up audits should determine if management took
   agreed-upon actions and whether the actions corrected the deficiency. The auditor must
   examine relevant evidence, review procedures, and perform tests and other audit steps
   necessary to verify that actions management took corrected the identified ―cause‖ of the
   deficiency, and the deficient condition no longer exists. When follow-up involves more than
   one location, the auditor should verify that reviews and tests are consistent at each location.
   The support for repeat audit results or clear follow-up audit reports are the same as required
   for the initial audit results.
   6.3.3. Timing. Timing for scheduling follow-up audits will be as follows:
      6.3.3.1. To the extent possible, schedule follow-up audits to start within 12 months after
      management completes action on report recommendations selected for follow-up.
      6.3.3.2. Do not delay follow-up on report recommendations if planned action on a few of
      the report recommendations will unduly delay follow-up on the entire report (i.e., more
      than 12 months from the audit report date). In the aforementioned case, the ACP has the
      option of reviewing items that management did not complete when accomplishing
      follow-up on other ―completed‖ or ―closed‖ recommendations in the report.
      6.3.3.3. The ACP may also choose to schedule follow-up on open recommendations
      separately from closed recommendations at a later date, but generally no later than 12
      months after management completes final action.
62                                                               AFAAI 65-102 8 MAY 2012


  6.3.4. Locations. Select locations either from those that originally accomplished the audit or
  from other locations using similar selection procedures as were used in the original audit.
  The ACP determines whether AAOs are to assist in the follow-up. Use the Project Plan
  Report to document locations and AAO participation (paragraph 1.4.1.2).
  6.3.5. Working Papers. The standards for documenting follow-up audits are the same as for
  documenting initial audits. Maintain a separate working paper file for the follow-up audit.
