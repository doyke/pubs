                                           Chapter 1

           ACTIVE DUTY AIRMAN PROMOTION PROGRAM ELEMENTS

1.1. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC). Enlisted Promotion Branch (DPSOE) provides
guidance to major commands (MAJCOM), field operating agencies (FOA), direct reporting units
(DRU), and military personnel section (MPS). Promotion selections are accomplished by using
the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) promotion file computer system for grades
SSgt through CMSgt.
1.2. Major Commands. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs may establish a quality control
program to support the enlisted promotion system.
1.3. MPS. Ensures all Airmen meet eligibility requirements and commander recommends
promotion in writing. Update and monitor promotion data in the Military Personnel Data System
(MilPDS). Ensures individuals receive promotion products, and assists with eligibility
requirements and commander recommendations.
1.4. Promotion Authority:
   1.4.1. The unit commander promotes to grades Amn through MSgt. Civilians in the grades
   of GS-09 or above, National Security Personnel System (NSPS) in payband 2, CMSgt, and
   SMSgt have promotion authority when serving as detachment chiefs or as academy
   commandants. Deployed commanders do not exercise promotion authority.
   1.4.2. The MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander promotes to grades SMSgt and CMSgt.
   This authority may be delegated to the vice commander, staff director, director for personnel,
   or numbered Air Force. For unified commands, authority may be delegated to the Air Force
   Element commander.
   1.4.3. The Chief of Staff, USAF, can promote any enlisted member to the next higher grade.
1.5. Announcement of Promotion Dates and Quotas:
   1.5.1. AFPC/DPSOE announces promotion dates for SSgt through CMSgt. HQ USAF
   distributes promotion quotas based on fiscal and statutory constraints, and projected
   vacancies in those grades.
1.6. Establishing Dates of Rank (DOR) and Promotion Sequence Numbers (PSN):
   1.6.1. AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank, establishes DOR for Airmen entering
   active duty. Subsequent promotions determine future DOR unless other actions take
   precedence.
   1.6.2. AFPC/DPSOE assigns a PSN to Airmen selected for promotion to SSgt through
   CMSgt based on DOR, Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) and date of
   birth (DOB). Supplemental selects are assigned PSNs of .9 (on increments previously
   announced) or .5 (unannounced future increment).
1.7. Determining Promotion Ineligibility. When individuals are rendered ineligible for
promotion, they cannot test, cannot be considered if already tested, and projected promotion will
be canceled. This includes selections under WAPS and fully qualified Amn - SrA. See Table
1.1 for ineligibility reasons.
 8                          AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


     1.7.1. A request to waive any ineligibility condition not approved in this AFI is considered
     an exception to policy. Request must be processed through the Airman’s unit and wing
     commander or equivalent before the request is sent to AFPC/DPSOE for final decision.
1.8. Accepting Promotion. Airmen who accept a promotion are eligible for reassignment and
selective retraining in the projected grade.
     1.8.1. Selects to the grade of MSgt and SMSgt with more than 18 years total active federal
     military service (TAFMS) by effective date of promotion will sign an AF Form 63, Active
     Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) Acknowledgement Statement or Statement of
     Understanding within 10 duty days after selections are confirmed. In addition, all CMSgt
     selects, regardless of TAFMS, will sign an AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment
     (ADSC) Acknowledgement Statement or Statement of Understanding within 10 duty days
     after selections are confirmed. (NOTE: This does not apply to individuals eligible to retire in
     a commissioned or warrant officer status.)
        1.8.1.1. The form will acknowledge that MSgt and SMSgt selects must obtain 2 years
        service retainability and incur a 2-year ADSC from the effective date of promotion to
        qualify for non-disability retirement. CMSgt selects must acknowledge and obtain 3 years
        service retainability and incur a 3-year ADSC from the effective date of promotion to
        qualify for non-disability retirement.
        1.8.1.2. Failure to withdraw an existing retirement application (approved or pending)
        within 10 duty days from presentation of the AF Form 63, Active Duty Service
        Commitment (ADSC) Acknowledgement Statement or Statement of Understanding will
        result in removal from the selection list.
        1.8.1.3. Email or fax the AF Form 63 or Statement of Understanding back to
        AFPC/DPSOTA.
     1.8.2. AFPC/DPSOTA:
        1.8.2.1. Provides a list of members to AFPC/DPSOE to cancel the promotion of a select
        who fails to withdraw any existing retirement application within 10 duty days after
        confirmation of the promotion selection and to withhold the promotion of a selectee who
        refuses to sign or does not acknowledge receipt of the AF Form 63 or Statement of
        Understanding.
        1.8.2.2. Forwards AF Form 63 or Statement of Understanding to Automated Records
        Management Systems (ARMS) for inclusion in Airman’s electronic record.
1.9. Promotion Ceremonies. Commanders may conduct promotion ceremonies on the last duty
day before the promotion effective date, and inform the Airman that a ceremony does not affect
pay, seniority, or entitlements.
1.10. Declining Promotion. Airmen may decline a promotion in writing any time prior to the
effective date (for example, applying for a voluntary retirement). The declination letter must
include name, SSN, promotion cycle, PSN if already selected, and a statement of understanding
that reinstatement will not be authorized.
     1.10.1. The MPS updates MilPDS (Grade Status Reason 3D) and sends a copy of the
     declination letter to ARMS for inclusion in the Airman's electronic record (see Table 1.1,
     Rule 15).
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                               9


1.11. Professional Military Education (PME) Requirements. Airmen selected for promotion
to SSgt, MSgt, or SMSgt must complete in-residence PME before assuming these grades (SSgt =
ALS, MSgt = NCOA, and SMSgt = SNCOA). MilPDS automatically withholds promotion for
those who do not complete appropriate PME prior to the effective date (see Table 1.2, Item 10).
1.12. Correcting Enlistment Grades. HQ AFPC/DPSOAA approves enlistment grade
corrections and updates MilPDS accordingly.
1.13. Correcting Promotion Effective Dates and Dates of Rank. AFPC/DPSOE corrects
promotion effective dates as a result of promotion withhold actions and supplemental promotion
selections through the Case Management System (CMS). Airmen are entitled to promotion
effective date corrections for the following reasons: supplemental promotion selection, PME
withhold, EPME waivers, retainability withhold, investigation (military/civilian) withhold, and
Primary AFSC Skill Level waivers
   1.13.1. MPS release (cancel) promotion withholds IAW AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1,
   Military Personnel Flight (MPS) Management and Military Personnel Data System
   (MilPDS) User Guidelines.
   1.13.2. MPS submit CMS requests on retainability withhold, investigation (military/civilian)
   withhold, Primary AFSC Skill Level waivers, and FIT Program withholds. MPS must
   include name, SSN, cycle and grade promoted to, new DOR, effective date and promotion
   sequence number, date commander approved promotion, and reason for promotion
   withholding.
   1.13.3. AFPC/DPSOE will ensure all supplemental promotion selection, PME withhold, and
   EPME waivers are processed approximately 45 days after promotion.

Table 1.1. Determining Ineligibility For Promotion (see Note 1).

        top enlisted performance report (EPR). PES code R (see notes 2
        and 6).
NOTES:
1. For ineligibility of Airmen entering commissioning programs, see paragraph 4.1.
2. Airmen will not receive supplemental promotion consideration for any cycle for which they
were ineligible under this rule. Change PES code to ―X‖ (if no other PES code applies), effective
the date the specific ineligibility condition no longer exists. Airmen exceeding Time-in-Grade
(TIG)/Time-in-Service (TIS) requirements for promotion to Amn through SrA may be promoted
the day the ineligibility condition no longer exists. Reference paragraph 3.2.2.2.
3. SSgt, TSgt, MSgt, and SMSgt with a retirement date effective the 1st day of the month
promotion increments begin remain eligible for promotion consideration.
4. Promotion reinstatement is not authorized and MPS change PES to code ―X‖ (if no other PES
code applies). For approved withdrawal of PCS declination statement (PES code ―C‖), effective
the day AFPC approves withdrawal of PCS declination statement. For Airmen in grades SrA
through SMSgt with a court martial conviction, PES code ―F‖ expires 12 months from date
sentence is adjudged or longest period of punishment, whichever is later. Airmen in grades A1C
and below with a court martial conviction, PES code ―F‖ will apply only if punishment is
imposed and will expire upon completion of the longest period of punishment. Airmen convicted
by court martial receiving a discharge as punishment who are approved for the Return to Duty
Program (RTDP) will undergo suspended court martial punishment (PES code ―F‖) while
serving a 12-month probationary period beginning the completion date of the RTDP. While
undergoing suspended court martial punishment, Airmen are ineligible for promotion.
5. In cases where reenlistment denial appeals are successfully approved, or cases where court-
martial/Article 15 punishment is set aside (includes suspended reduction), the PES code will
revert to the original PES code unless another applies. The MPS notifies AFPC/DPSOE via
email in cases where reinstatement applies.
6. Airmen in grades AB through A1C meeting TIG/TIS promotion requirements in paragraphs
2.1. and 2.2. can be promoted no earlier than the close out date of an EPR with a rating of ―3‖ or
higher that is not a referral, if otherwise eligible and approved by the commander. Airmen in
grades SrA through SMSgt regain promotion eligibility for future promotion cycles only after
receiving a report with an overall rating of ―3‖ or higher that is not a referral report and closes
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                     13


out on or before the next promotion eligibility cutoff date (PECD), if otherwise eligible.
Reinstatement is not authorized.
7. Commanders may request waiver of PES code ―Q‖ for TSgts meeting all requirements for
upgrade to the 7-skill level, but are awaiting attendance to 7-level school. MPS forwards
approved waiver requests to AFPC/DPSOE.
8. Per the FY97 National Defense Authorization Act and Disability Retirement Act (NDAA), if
there is a projected promotion in system and PES code is ―X‖ (eligible for promotion), the
Airman may be placed on the TDRL in the projected grade. If the PES code is other than ―X,‖
HQ AFPC/DPSDD will advise HQ AFPC/DPSOE to review the reason for ineligibility and
determine if it can be waived. The FY02 NDAA amended section 1212 of Title 10 USC to
authorize separation with severance pay in the grade to which the Airman would have been
promoted, had it not been for the physical disability. AFPC will update PES code ―L‖ and Grade
Status Reason (GSR) ―3J‖ upon receipt of the disability retirement or discharge message.
9. Members who have an approved HYT extension are eligible for promotion, however, member
must be able to obtain the necessary retainability associated with the promotion; if member is
unable to obtain retainability then he/she is ineligible during the promotion cycle. Promotion
eligibility reinstatement is not authorized for an Airman whose approved retirement date is
withdrawn or changed (this includes HYT extensions).
10. Reinstatement of promotion eligibility is authorized if the decision to discharge is reversed
and RI9A300 is removed.

(PES Code ―E‖). The Commander has the discretion to release the withhold action at any time
and either recommend or non-recommend the Airman for promotion.
2. Commanders should consider recommendations from the Treatment Team (TT). The
promotion authority retains final decision.
3. A commander will withhold an Airman's promotion if he or she is under investigation, or the
subject of a military or civil law inquiry (formal or informal) which may result in action under
UCMJ or prosecution by civil authorities. The commander may continue to withhold the
promotion when the investigation or inquiry is complete but no determination has been made as
to the action the military or civil authorities will take.
4. Wing commander or equivalent (Equivalent level Commander is defined as the first Senior
rater in the rating chain) is the approval and disapproval authority for EPME waivers (cannot be
further delegated). They may defer EPME requirements for a maximum of 179-days for Airmen
who lack EPME completion for promotion to SSgt, MSgt, and SMSgt grades. This waiver
process does not waive any other withhold conditions. Process these requests through the chain
of command (squadron commander, group commander, and wing commander) to
AFPC/DPSOE. The only exception for waivers beyond 179 days is for those on 365 or extended
179-day deployments. Route these requests through AFPC/DPSOE. If approved, AFPC/DPSOE
will update MilPDS and, if required, will grant a retroactive effective date IAW paragraph 1.13.
5. Commanders should use AFI 10-248, Fitness Program, Attachment 13, for administrative
options for Airmen who fail to maintain fitness standards. Update PES Code ―N‖ if the
commander nonrecommends promotion; update PES Code ―Y‖ if the commander withholds
promotion. Reference paragraph 4.2. of this AFI when deferring promotions to the grades of
SSgt through CMSgt.

promotion cycle. Those Airmen promoted beyond a normal cycle are not entitled to apply for
correction of military records under the provisions of AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of
Rank, to have their effective date retroactively adjusted to their DOR.

                                          Chapter 2

  ACTIVE DUTY AIRMAN PROMOTIONS TO GRADES AMN THROUGH CMSGT

2.1. Airman and A1C Promotions (seeTable 1.3).
   2.1.1. An Airman Basic (AB) is eligible for promotion to Amn at 6 months TIG. An Amn is
   eligible for promotion to A1C at 10 months TIG.
   2.1.2. Individuals initially enlisting for a period of 6 years are promoted from AB or Amn to
   A1C upon completion of either technical training or 20 weeks of technical training (start date
   of the 20 week period is the date of Basic Military Training (BMT) completion), whichever
   occurs first. The DOR for A1C is then adjusted to the date completed BMT without back pay
   and allowances.
   2.1.3. The promotion authority must recommend the promotion in writing before the Airman
   assumes the grade.
2.2. SrA Promotions (seeTable 1.3).
   2.2.1. Airmen (fully qualified) are promoted to SrA upon meeting minimum requirements in
   Table 2.1, when recommended by the promotion authority in writing, and have completed 36
   months TIS and 20 months TIG or 28 months TIG (whichever occurs first). (EXCEPTION:
   CCT and PJ six year enlistees are to be promoted to SrA upon reaching 28 months TIG or 36
   months TIS and 20 months TIG (whichever occurs first), provided they have obtained a 3-
   skill level and are recommended by their Unit Commander. These individuals are eligible for
   SrA BTZ, which allows them to be considered with their peers and promoted under the same
   Air Force policy.)
       2.2.1.1. In situations where an Airman is unable to obtain their 3-skill level before the
       projected promotion date and training delay was due to no fault of the Airman, the Unit
       Commander must ensure retroactive promotion is requested through the MPS upon the
       Airmen obtaining their 3-skill level.
   2.2.2. SrA Below-The-Zone (BTZ) Promotion Program. SrA BTZ is a one-time promotion
   consideration to advance to SrA 6 months prior to the fully qualified phase point listed in
   paragraph 2.2.1 above. Host wing commander (or senior Air Force officer serving in that
   capacity) establishes written administrative procedures for small units serviced by their
   installation, and may do so for large units if desired. Procedures must ensure all eligible
   Airmen receive fair, equitable, and timely BTZ consideration. Airmen must meet skill level
   requirements in Table 2.1.
       2.2.2.1. AFPC/DPSOE publishes additional program guidance via memorandum.
   2.2.3. Airmen are identified during the processing month and SrA BTZ promotion selections
   are made during the months indicated in Table 2.6.
   2.2.4. Airmen must be ―considered‖ by the losing unit if their RNLTD is the 1st day of the
   first processing month or later.
2.3. MPS Identify Eligibles:
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                    17


   2.3.1. Personnel Systems Management Section (PSM) provides an automatic quarterly end
   of month (EOM) output product to the Career Enhancement Element within the first 10 days
   of the first processing month (i.e. Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct). The roster identifies all A1C’s who
   meet or exceed the TIS and TIG requirements, regardless of promotion ineligibility
   conditions (i.e. on the control roster, PAFSC skill level too low, undergoing Article 15
   suspended reduction, ect.), and whose grade status reason (GSR) does not equal code ―5Q‖
   (previously considered for SrA BTZ). This output product automatically updates the GSR to
   ―5Q‖ to prevent them from appearing on future SrA BTZ listings. Remove names of those
   exceeding TIG/TIS requirements and are ineligible for promotion. The output product
   produces an MPS alphabetical listing and a three-part unit listing:
      2.3.1.1. Part I: Identifies A1C’s with no quality indicators in their record.
      2.3.1.2. Part II: Lists ―questionable eligibles‖ (individuals with quality indicators) who
      may not be qualified for BTZ promotion.
      2.3.1.3. Part III: Lists A1C’s who meet the TIG and TIS requirements, but cannot be
      selected due to promotion ineligibility conditions listed in Table 1.1.
      2.3.1.4. Distribute quotas based on 15 percent of eligible (eligibility is based on TIG/TIS
      alone, regardless of normal ineligible conditions) and obtain host wing commander
      approval. Host wing commander may delegate approval of quota distribution no lower
      than the MPS Commander.
      2.3.1.4. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Determine promotion quotas, based on population
      size of promotion eligible A1Cs and distribute quotas to units base-wide.
      2.3.1.5. Verify BTZ eligibility of all A1C departing PCS and prepare a BTZ selection
      folder for airmen departing prior to the 1st processing month for the BTZ quarter they are
      TIG/TIS eligible and whose RNLTD is the 1st day of the first processing month or later.
      2.3.1.6. Update SrA BTZ promotions immediately upon receipt of selections in PDS in
      accordance with AFCSM 36-699 Volume I.
      2.3.1.7. Forward fully documented supplemental requests to AFPC/DPSOE for airmen
      not previously considered during their normal quarter board.
   2.3.2. Nominations:
      2.3.2.1. Commanders must review any EPR(s) the Airman may have, his/her Personal
      Information File (PIF) if available, and discuss nominations with the member’s
      supervisors/rating chain prior to making a nomination decision, regardless if the Airman
      is meeting a large unit or a small unit/Central Base Board (CBB).
      2.3.2.2. AF form 1206, Nomination for Award, is now required for all A1C’s being
      nominated for BTZ consideration. NOTE: DBH reports are no longer required or
      authorized.
2.4. Central Base Board (CBB) Process:
   2.4.1. Units are notified if they are a large or small unit as soon as possible, but not later than
   the second week of the first processing month.
18                        AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


     2.4.1.1. Large units (7 or more eligibles) receive their own quotas and promote at unit
     level. Unless the host wing commander establishes written procedures, commanders of
     large units will establish written selection procedures that ensure the SrA BTZ program is
     fair, equitable, and provides timely promotion consideration. Once selections are made,
     large unit commanders underline the selectee(s) name, sign, date, and return the BTZ
     eligibility listing to the MPS not later than the last day of the selection month (i.e. 31
     Mar, 30 Jun, 30 Sep, 31 Dec).
     2.4.1.1. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Large units will receive quotas based on their
     population size, and make selections by convening a promotion board at unit-level.
     Provide minutes to 366 FSS/FSMPD (Career Development Flight).
     2.4.1.2. Small units (6 or less eligibles) are combined into one pool of eligibles to form
     the CBB population. The host wing commander will establish written BTZ selection
     procedures to include method of nominating, number of nominations, time table to
     complete required actions, board composition, areas to be considered, scoring scale,
     announcing selections and any other required actions necessary to ensure the SrA BTZ
     program is fair, equitable, and provides timely promotion consideration. The MPS,
     Career Enhancement Element, will ensure they have received all nomination packages
     from units with eligibles; if a unit is not going to nominate, ensure negative reply is
     received.
     2.4.1.2. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Commanders will forward small unit nomination
     packages to 366 FSS/FSMP (Military Personnel Flight) for consideration by the Central
     Base Board (CBB).
 2.4.2. Units cannot aggregate above the unit level. If a unit commander (not group) is the
 commander having promotion authority for more than one organization, the eligibles are
 combined at the unit level and the unit remains a small unit or becomes a large unit (7 or
 more eligibles).
  2.4.3. Host wing commander may require all units under their command (not tenant units) to
  nominate to the CBB. Tenant units remain large units unless host wing commander allows
  them to compete at the CBB.
  2.4.4. If it’s discovered an airman was not considered during the eligible quarter board and
  the error is discovered before BTZ selections are announced large unit commanders will
  consider the airman and adjust selections accordingly, the CBB will reconvene to consider
  small unit eligibles, and selections are adjusted accordingly. If discovered after selections are
  announced, request supplemental BTZ considerations according to paragraph 2.5.
 2.4.5. Alternates may be promoted in the event a selectee is removed before the effective
 date. Do not withhold SrA BTZ promotions. Remove the projected promotion for any quality
 indicators listed in Table 1.2 (including under investigation, use GSR 3C). If extenuating
 circumstances exist, request reinstatement in accordance with paragraph 4.3. If the first
 alternate's SrA BTZ DOR has already passed, they will receive the original BTZ DOR and an
 effective date of unit commander approval. MPS assists the airman in applying for a
 retroactive promotion effective date according to paragraph 1.13.
  2.4.6. After selections are made, unit commanders provide a written promotion
  recommendation prior to the promotion effective date.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                            19


2.5. Supplemental BTZ Consideration:
   2.5.1. Unit Commanders may request supplemental BTZ consideration for individuals who
   should have been considered by a previous board and the error is not discovered until after
   promotions are announced. Unit commanders provide justification for members not receiving
   a fair consideration and forwards fully documented supplemental request to the MPS for
   consideration.
   2.5.2. Supplemental consideration will not be given for the following reasons:
      2.5.2.1. Incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP.
      2.5.2.2. Denied BTZ nomination due to incorrect data reflected on the BTZ output
      products or in the UPRG.
      2.5.2.3. BTZ eligibility listing not returned to the MPS or individuals was ―overlooked‖
      on the listing.
      2.5.2.4. Nomination packages or decoration not completed/turned in/approved in time to
      meet the board.
   2.5.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Nomination Procedures:
      2.5.3.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Unit commanders will perform a quality
      force review prior to nominating individuals for promotion to SrA BTZ. Only the highest
      quality personnel will be nominated.
      2.5.3.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Nomination packages, including those
      being considered by unit-level promotion boards, will consist of the following
      documents:
          2.5.3.2.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) BTZ Nomination Fact Sheet
          (Attachment 3 (Added), Sample BTZ Nomination Fact Sheet (AF Form 1206,
          Nomination for Award)), front side only.
              2.5.3.2.1.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 15-line max limit on Fact
              Sheet.        Line   dissemination will be predicated on overall
              achievements/performance.
          2.5.3.2.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Suspense date for nomination
          packages being sent to CBB is established by the 366th Fighter Wing Command
          Chief Master Sergeant (366 FW/CCC).
   2.5.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) CBB Procedures:
      2.5.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366 FW/CCC                       will    notify   group
      superintendents (CCC) of date when CBB will convene.
      2.5.4.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) CBB will consist of 366 FW/CCC or
      designated representative, and SNCO group representatives.
      2.5.4.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) CBB will convene on the scheduled date,
      at which time a 366 FSS/FSMP representative will instruct board members on the
      selection procedures using Attachment 4 (Added), Nomination/Selection Process. The
 20                         AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


         366 FSS/FSMP representative will serve as the board recorder and remain available
         throughout the entire board.
   2.5.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Post Board Procedures:
         2.5.5.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Board president of unit-level boards will
         forward results to the unit commander and 366 FSS/FSMPD (Attachment 5 (Added),
         Sample SrA BTZ Promotion Board Letter For Large Unit Promotion Board). Board
         president of CBB will forward board results to 366 FSS/FSMPD (Attachment 6
         (Added), SrA BTZ Promotion Board Letter for Central Base Board). Forward
         Attachment 7 (Added), 366th Fighter Wing SrA Below-the-Zone Promotion Score Fact
         Sheet, along with Attachments 5 and 6.
         2.5.5.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366 FSS/FSMPD will forward a complete
         listing of central base and large unit board promotees to 366 FW/CC for
         approval/disapproval.
         2.5.5.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Following approval of CBB results, 366
         FW/CC will authorize release of SrA BTZ promotees, including those selected by unit-
         level boards. 366 FSS/FSMPD will compile all wing promotees’ information, and update
         the PDS.
2.6. SSgt, TSgt, and MSgt Promotions (see Table 1.3). Airmen compete and test under the
Weighted Airmen Promotion System (WAPS) in the Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC)
held on the PECD. Table 2.2 outlines WAPS factors and formulas.
      2.6.1. AFPC/DPSOE:
         2.6.1.1. Makes promotion selections using WAPS (promotion file) and data in MilPDS.
         EPRs covering the last 5 years (maximum of 10 reports) are used to compute the EPR
         time-weighted factor score. All eligibles are required to have an EPR that closes out
         within 5 years of the PECD on file to compete for promotion. If a member does not have
         an EPR on file, they cannot be considered for promotion until their next projected EPR
         closes out or until a directed by HAF EPR is completed for promotion consideration. At
         that time, the member will be considered supplementally.
         2.6.1.2. Considers Airmen automatically eligible (see Table 2.3, Rule 3, Note 4) if they
         are in a retraining status without a PAFSC skill level (Table 2.3) in their current grade.
         2.6.1.3. Applies the quota to each promotion Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), with the
         highest scores in each AFSC selected.
         2.6.1.4. Promotes Airmen in chronic critical shortage (CCS) skills at a higher selection
         rate than those of non-CCS skills.
         2.6.1.5. Considers Airmen with SKT exemptions in one of two promotion AFSCs
         (00XXXX CCS or 00XXX for non-CCS). (See Table 2.4, Note 1.) EXCEPTION:
         Retrainees in AFSCs without SKTs compete along with all other Airmen in that AFSC.
            2.6.1.5.1. After serving in an awarded AFSC for at least 1 year, Airmen are SKT-
            EXEMPT for 24 months once they return to an awarded AFSC for which they are no
            longer fully qualified. Update a DIERT (date initially entered retraining) date equal
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                              21


         to the date the Airman returned to the previous AFSC. For periods of less than 1
         year, ensure the Airman takes the SKT.
     2.6.1.6. Accomplishes an order of merit list in each promotion AFSC from the highest
     score to lowest score and applies the promotion quota. Selects all Airmen with tied scores
     at the cutoff for their AFSC.
     2.6.1.7. Conducts data verification on selects NLT 10 days after virtual promotion
     release and notifies MPS when errors are identified.
  2.6.2. The MPS:
     2.6.2.1. MPS will instruct eligible Airmen to review their records in ARMS, and
     obtain/review their DVR/score notices on vMPF to verify the data used in the promotion
     selection process.
     2.6.2.2. Schedules and tests Airmen using the CAFSC held on the PECD. IAW AFI 36-
     2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing Program, Attachment 9, Airmen who fail to
     show for scheduled promotion testing without a valid reason are ineligible for promotion
     consideration during that particular promotion cycle (Table 1.1, Rule 10). Ensure the
     Airman signs a statement in accordance with paragraph 1.11, or the AF Form 1566,
     WAPS Test Verification, used to administer tests, to document declination.
     2.6.2.3. Notifies Airmen in writing when a data error is found during data verification
     that could result in nonselection, and direct individuals to not assume the new grade until
     AFPC/DPSOE confirms the selection status.
  2.6.3. Unit Commanders:
     2.6.3.1. Advise selects that promotions are tentative pending verification by
     AFPC/DPSOE as outlined in paragraph 2.6.1.7.
     2.6.3.2. Advise Airmen not to assume the next higher grade if data verification discovers
     missing or erroneous data.
     2.6.3.3. Recommend promotion in writing prior to assuming the higher grade, and
     initiate nonrecommendation and removal action when necessary.
     2.6.3.4. May request rescheduling from the MSS Commander for Airmen who did not
     report for testing as specified on the AF Form 1566 or RIP 1566 if convinced the Airman
     did everything within his or her control to make the appointment. If rescheduling is
     disapproved for first time no-shows, MPS updates the PES code to ―P.‖
  2.6.4. To be eligible for promotion consideration, an Airman must:
     2.6.4.1. Meet all requirements in Table 2.1.
     2.6.4.2. Review records in ARMS, obtain/review DVR on the vMPF and report any
     errors to the appropriate MPS workcenter or agency for correction of errors.
     2.6.4.3. Test for promotion as outlined in AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel
     Testing System. Failure to report for scheduled testing (which includes both tests, if
     applicable) renders an Airman ineligible for promotion consideration unless rescheduling
     is approved. A second no-show automatically renders an Airman ineligible for
     promotion.
 22                         AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


   2.6.5. Airman prepares for promotion testing (includes obtaining testing material, knowing
   testing window and date, knowing promotion AFSC), which is solely an individual
   responsibility and should not be considered an item for enlisted professional development.
   Group study in any forum or format is prohibited.
   2.6.6. Airman retrieves his/her WAPS score notice after promotions are announced. WAPS
   score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the promotion
   consideration process and must never be provided to, or used by, anyone other than the
   individual and his/her commander. Commanders may request an airman’s scores from the
   airman or the MPS. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and
   advisory counseling on the airman’s behalf and must not allow further dissemination of
   scores or their use for purposes other than advisory counseling.
2.7. SMSgt and CMSgt Promotions (see Table 1.3). Airmen compete, and are selected for
promotion, in the superintendent level (for SMSgt) or the chief enlisted manager (CEM) code
(for CMSgt) of their CAFSC. Individuals with a reporting identifier (RI) or special duty
identifier (SDI) designated as their CAFSC on the PECD will compete within that RI or SDI.
Promotion selection for SMSgt and CMSgt is a two-phase process consisting of WAPS factors
and a central evaluation board. See Table 2.5 for WAPS factors and formulas.
   2.7.1. AF/A1:
         2.7.1.1. Appointed as the approval authority for the enlisted evaluation board formal
         charge and promotion policy associated with convening of all enlisted evaluation boards.
         2.7.1.2. Prior to the convening of each enlisted evaluation board review and approve the
         formal board charge and other essential policy guidance for managing evaluation boards
         and feedback from the Board President.
      2.7.2. HQ AFPC/CC:
         2.7.2.1. Appoints board members for the SNCO evaluation board.
         2.7.2.2. Convenes SNCO evaluation board.
         2.7.2.3. Approves evaluation board results.
         2.7.2.4. Notifies parent MAJCOM of eligibles rendered not fully qualified (NFQ) for
         promotion by the central evaluation board. ―NFQ‖ may be used when a record does not
         reflect potential for advancement to the next higher grade.
         2.7.2.5. The Executive Director assumes these responsibilities in the commander's
         absence.
      2.7.3. HQ AFPC/DPSOE:
         2.7.3.1. Announces eligibility cutoff and board convening dates annually. Sends NFQ
         memorandums to servicing MPS’s for chain of command notifications.
         2.7.3.2. Uses the promotion master file to rank Airmen in order of merit within AFSC or
         CEM code using the combined evaluation board score (270 to 450 points) and the
         weighted factor score (345 points maximum).
         2.7.3.3. Applies the quota to each promotion AFSC or CEM, with the highest scores in
         each AFSC or CEM selected.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                              23


       2.7.3.4. Promotes Airmen in chronic critical shortage (CCS) skills at a higher selection
       rate (determined annually by USAF/A1PP) than non-CCS skills.
       2.7.3.5. Makes promotion selections using WAPS and the Central Evaluation Board
       results.
       2.7.3.6. Prepares select lists for virtual release.
       2.7.3.7. Prepares and forwards written NFQ notifications to AFPC/CC and member’s
       chain of command when the board renders an Airman NFQ. For those AFSCs with only
       one Airman eligible and that eligible Airman is rendered NFQ, the AFSC will be
       deactivated from the promotion cycle.
       2.7.3.8. AFPC/DPSOE conducts data verification on selects prior to virtual promotion
       release. When a data error is found that could result in nonselection, the Airman is
       notified of the error, in writing and directed not to assume the new grade until
       AFPC/DPSOE confirms the selection status.
   2.7.4. HQ AFPC/PB:
       2.7.4.1. Conducts the Central Evaluation Board in accordance with Chapter 3.
   2.7.5. The MPS:
       2.7.5.1. Schedules and tests Airmen using the CAFSC held on the PECD to determine
       test requirements. IAW AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System,
       Attachment 9, Airmen who fail to show for scheduled         promotion testing without a
       valid reason may be ineligible for promotion consideration during that particular
       promotion cycle (Table 1.1, Rule 10). MPSs notify AFPC/DPSOE by message of
       Airmen who already tested, but later desire to decline promotion consideration. Ensures
       the Airman signs a statement in accordance with paragraph 1.11 or the AF Form 1566
       used to administer tests     to document their declination.
       2.7.5.2. Notifies unit commanders of each eligible individual's promotion status.
       2.7.5.3. Instructs Airmen to review their record in ARMS, obtain and review their DVR
       along with their score notice on the vMPF to verify the data used in the promotion
       process.
   2.7.6. Airmen:
       2.7.6.1. Must meet the eligibility criteria outlined in paragraph 2.6.4, Table 1.2, Rules
       5 & 6 and have an EPR closing out within the last 12 months prior to the PECD.
       2.7.6.2. Obtain and review DVRs along with score notices on the vMPF, review
       electronic record in ARMS and senior NCO selection folder to ensure data is correct, and
       notify the appropriate MPS workcenter or agency for correction of any errors. Senior
       NCO selection folder contents can be obtained/reviewed by contacting the Selection
       Board Secretariat at DSN 665-2353; Fax 665-6242; HQ AFPC/PBR-2, 550 C Street
       West, Suite 5, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4707; or records.review@randolph.af.mil.
2.8. Supplemental Promotions for SSgt Through CMSgt. AFPC/DPSOE conducts in-system
supplemental promotion consideration monthly after initial promotion selection and announces
supplemental selection board dates for eligible Airmen. See paragraph 1.13 for DOR and
 24                        AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


effective date corrections. Supplemental promotion consideration will not be granted if the error
or omission appeared on/in the Airman’s DVR, ARMS record, or senior NCO selection folder
and no corrective or follow-up action was taken by the Airman prior to the promotion selection
date for SSgt through MSgt and prior to the original evaluation board for SMSgt and CMSgt.
Fully documented supplemental consideration requests will be submitted in writing, to include
the Airman’s unit commander’s recommendation to the MPS. MPSs will review and forward
requests to AFPC/DPSOE.
   2.8.1. If an Airman missed one or more testing cycles (due to deployment or hospitalization,
   etc.), he/she is considered retroactively. This is done using scores from the first available
   WAPS tests upon return. If selected for previous cycles, the Airman will receive a retroactive
   date of rank and back pay.
   2.8.2. A separate written request is not required when an individual has indicated his or her
   desire to apply for supplemental consideration in conjunction with the EPR appeal process.
   NOTE: Ensure Blocks 9 and 10, on the AF Form 948, Application for Correction/Removal of
   Evaluation Reports, are completed.
       2.8.3. Supplemental promotion may be granted for those individuals who are
       recommended by their unit commander and are nonweighable, had a change to the
       weighted data elements (see Table 2.2) (must be effective prior to PECD), or had wrong
       or missing data for a specific cycle.
       2.8.3.1. A supplemental request based on a missing decoration must have a closeout date
       on or before PECD, and the commander’s recommendation date on the DECOR 6 must
       be before the date AFPC makes the selections for promotion. Resubmitted decorations
       (downgraded, lost, amended, etc.), to verify the original submission was placed into
       official channels prior to the selection date. If the date of the special order is prior to the
       month promotion selections are made, the decoration will automatically update the
       promotion master file. If the date of the special order is the month selections are made or
       later, send the following documents to AFPC/DPSOE: Written request with unit
       commander’s recommendation, citation, DECOR 6 (both pages), amendments (if any),
       documentation verifying when decoration was placed into official channels, and
       documentation of corrective/follow-up action taken by the Airman.
   2.8.4. SNCO Supplemental procedures: There are no automatic approvals for supplemental
   promotion consideration. Table 2.5 is used to determine whether or not a request for
   supplemental promotion consideration is authorized, and if so, whether or not mandatory
   scoring is required. Final decisions for approval of supplemental consideration requests rest
   with the AFBCMR or AFPC/DPSOE.
       2.8.4.1. MSgts and SMSgt meeting one of the reasons in Table 2.5 may be considered
       supplementally. These individuals will receive supplemental selection board
       consideration, if approved in accordance with Chapter 3.
       2.8.4.2. Supplemental board consideration is not provided when corrected data increases
       an Airman’s weighted factor score so that the total revised promotion score is at or above
       the cutoff needed for selection. In such cases, Airmen become selects without
       supplemental board evaluation.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                               25


       2.8.4.3. Those personnel requiring a board score greater than the maximum allowable
       board score (450 points) will not be granted supplemental promotion consideration.
   2.8.5. Score notices are not provided for Airmen who receive supplemental board
   consideration to SMSgt and CMSgt, unless they were not considered by the original board.
   Then weighted scores are provided (not a board score).
   2.8.6. Supplemental Processing Instructions:
       2.8.6.1. Individuals supplementally selected for promotion to grades SSgt through
       CMSgt receive PSNs of .9 (on increments previously announced) or .5 (unannounced
       future increment).
       2.8.6.2. Individuals selected and assigned a .9 PSN are automatically projected for
       promotion the first day of the month following the month they were considered/selected
       in. This is to ensure data verification is completed and the commander recommends
       promotion prior to the promotion automatically consummating.
       2.8.6.3. The MPS:
          2.8.6.3.1. Ensures selects assigned a .9 PSN obtain the required 2 years retainability
          for promotion to MSgt or SMSgt, and 3 years retainability for promotion to CMSgt
          from effective date of promotion, and may apply for a change to their ETS once the
          retroactive effective date is processed.
          2.8.6.3.2. Instructs commanders to make a written promotion recommendation.
       2.8.6.4. The Unit Commander:
          2.8.6.4.1. Instructs selects with a .9 PSN that they are not to assume the higher grade
          until they obtain retainability (if required).
          2.8.6.4.2. Notifies selects with a .9 PSN they may assume the next higher grade on
          the date of written approval, if data verification is complete and they have required
          retainability.
          2.8.6.4.3. AFPC/DPSOE will grant a retroactive effective date correction to match an
          Airman’s DOR in accordance with paragraph 1.13.
2.9. Promoting Airmen in Missing Status. For Airmen declared ―missing in action‖ (MIA) or
―prisoner of war‖ (POW), the MPS forwards the unit commander's promotion recommendation
or nonrecommendation to ARMS for inclusion in member’s electronic record, forwards a copy to
AFPC/DPSOE, determines promotion eligibility using Table 2.1, and waives all other
requirements. The AFPC Commander (Executive Director in the Commander's absence)
determines promotion for these Airmen. AF/A1PP determines promotion for other categories of
Airmen declared in a missing status.
   2.9.1. AFPC/DPSOE:
       2.9.1.1. Promotes recommended Airmen in the grades of A1C and below when they
       meet TIG and TIS requirements in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2.
       2.9.1.2. Considers SrA through SMSgt for promotion during the first or next normally
       scheduled cycle based on the TIG and TIS eligibility requirements. The Airman's TIG
       and TIS must meet or exceed the average TIG and TIS phase points for those selected in
 26                          AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


         their AFSC or CEM code. Selects those meeting or exceeding TIG and TIS for
         promotion, if recommended by the unit commander, and assigns a PSN.
2.10. Promoting Under Stripes for Exceptional Performers (STEP). This program
supplements existing Airman Promotion programs and is designed to accommodate unique
circumstances that, in the commander’s judgment, clearly warrant promotion. It is intended to
provide a means to promote Airmen for compelling, although perhaps not quantifiable, reasons.
Isolated heroic acts or specific achievements should not be the sole basis for promotion under
this program. Commanders should guard against using STEP as an enlisted below-the-
promotion-zone (BPZ) program. Commanders should give WAPS the opportunity to promote
our top performers and incline toward promoting deserving hard chargers with average time in
service compared to their peers. STEP promotions are authorized to grades SSgt, TSgt, and
MSgt. Airmen are not supplementally considered for STEP. DOR and effective date are the date
the selection authority announces the promotion.
      2.10.1. Eligibility requirements:
         2.10.1.1. Airmen must complete Airman Leadership School before being considered for
         STEP promotion to SSgt, or the resident NCO Academy before being considered for
         STEP promotion to MSgt (this requirement cannot be waived).
         2.10.1.2. A minimum of 12 months TIG is required for STEP promotion to TSgt and
         MSgt; promotions to SSgt must have a minimum of 6 months TIG.
         2.10.1.3. Commanders may waive other promotion eligibility requirements in Table 2.1.
   2.10.2. Selections should be based on recommendations from subordinate commanders or
   personal knowledge of the individual. Time consuming administrative boards are
   discouraged. Only one STEP promotion per career is allowed.
   2.10.3. AFPC/DPSOE:
         2.10.3.1. Distributes STEP quotas to MAJCOMS, FOAs, DRUs and Air Force elements
         with 300 or more SrA through TSgts assigned.
         2.10.3.2. HQ AFPC considers MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs without a quota (less than
         300 SrA through TSgt) and announces procedures via annual STEP message.
         2.10.3.3. Updates all STEP promotions into MilPDS. The effective date and DOR are the
         date the promotion authority announces the selections.
      2.10.4. The MPS:
         2.10.4.1. Completes P-series orders and notifies AFPC/DPSOE by message of STEP
         selections within 72 hours. Include name, SSN, grade promoted to, effective date,
         CAFSC, assignment unit, special order number, and date.
         2.10.4.2. Notifies AFPC/DPSOE by message of STEP selections within 72 hours.
         Include name, SSN, grade promoted to, effective date, CAFSC, assignment unit,
         special order number, and date.
2.11. Promoting Medal of Honor Recipients. AFPC/DPSOE automatically promotes Medal
of Honor recipients one grade unless they currently serve in the grade of CMSgt. The effective
date is the 1st day of the month following the date of the order. If the Airman is on a promotion
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                  27


selection list, the effective date of the additional promotion is the 1st day of the month following
the normal selection list promotion.
2.12. Promoting Prior-Service Airmen and Former Officers. HQ AFPC/DPSOA (Skills
Management Branch) initially classifies Airmen and identifies their skill-level on entry to active
duty. NOTE: Initial classification and later skill-level upgrade are the only basis for satisfying
the skill level requirement in Table 2.1. However, those personnel in the grades of SrA through
TSgt returned to duty in an AFSC skill level that does not make them eligible to test for
promotion (SrA = 5 level, SSgt = 5 level, and TSgt = 7 level) are authorized a DIERT date equal
to their EAD. The DIERT date will expire 24 months from their EAD.
2.13. Promoting Airmen During Declared National Emergency or War. The Air Force uses
Title 37, U.S.C., Section 201; DoDD 1304.20; War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1),
Annex G; Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Personnel (DCS/P) Emergency Actions
Book (EAB) to determine enlisted promotions under emergency or war conditions.
   2.13.1. The Air Force Combat Operations Staff/Contingency Support Staff, Military
   Personnel Readiness Center (AFCOS/CSS MPRC), with AFPC Personnel Readiness Center
   (PRC), implement instructions by priority message. Use the staff guidance and preformatted
   messages outlined in the DCS/P EAB whenever possible.
   2.13.2. HQ USAF/A1PP may:
       2.13.2.1. Suspend existing promotion programs and accelerate existing promotion
       increments to meet emergency wartime grade requirements.
       2.13.2.2. Initiate a decentralized system of temporary promotions. The selection
       authority is the MAJCOM commander, who may further delegate this authority. See
       Table 2.1 for minimum TIG and TIS at the time of promotion to determine eligibility.
       NOTE: Title 10 U.S.C., Chapter 31, Para 5.17, limits CMSgt end strength to one percent
       of the enlisted force and SMSgt end strength to 2.5 percent of the enlisted force.
       2.13.2.3. Select Airmen on a best-qualified basis subject to limitations or requirements
       specified by the MAJCOM commander. HQ USAF specifies any changes from current
       eligibility requirements. Make promotions to fill vacancies (unit, wing commander, or
       MAJCOM, depending on the level promotion authority delegated) in approved wartime
       grade requirements. Reservists mobilized from the inactive status list and recalled retirees
       must serve a minimum of 6 months continuous active duty following recall to be eligible
       for promotion. The DOR for promotion will equal the effective date.
2.14. Air Force Wounded Warrior (AFW2) Program.
   2.14.1. Promotion to SSgt, TSgt and MSgt will use the following procedures:
       2.14.1.1. Once awarded RI 9W200, AFPC/DPSOE will consider the AFW2 for
       promotion if the AFW2 is promotion eligible and tests. AFW2s will compete for
       promotion with other Air Force-wide Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT) exempt Airmen
       in a promotion Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC); taking only the Promotion Fitness
       Examination (PFE). At anytime during this process, AFW2 personnel will be given the
       option to test SKT. If desired, they will compete in their Control Air Force Specialty
       Code (CAFSC) at the time of their injury.
28                          AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


        2.14.1.2. AFW2 Airmen remain SKT exempt indefinitely or until they are returned to
        their previously awarded AFSC(s) or reclassified. AFW2 personnel who are reclassified
        or returned to a previously award AFSC will be SKT exempt for 2 years.
        2.14.1.3. AFPC/DPSOE will assist the AFW2’s nearest MPS to schedule testing and
        help meet the AFW2’s testing needs, IE., if physically incapable of WAPS testing alone,
        yet desiring to test. MPS will contact AFPC/DPSOE for additional guidance and
        approval.
        2.14.1.4. Active Duty Service Commitment requirements for promotion of an AFW2 are
        automatically waived.
     2.14.2. Special promotion considerations to SSgt, TSgt and MSgt:
        2.14.2.1. To ensure AFW2s are considered for promotion and are promoted along with
        their peers, the following promotion procedures will apply in rare cases. If an AFW2 is
        promotion eligible, but cannot WAPS test as documented by a medical authority due to
        catastrophic injuries; they will be considered for promotion based on a 5-year look back
        formula. A catastrophic injury is defined as a permanent, severely disabling injury,
        disorder, or disease that compromises the ability to carry out the activities of daily living
        to such a degree that a Service Member or Veteran (SM/V) requires personal or
        mechanical assistance to leave home, bed, or requires constant supervision to avoid
        physical harm to self or others.
            2.14.2.1.1. AFPC/DPSOE automatically considers each AFW2 (if unable to test as
            documented by competent medical authority) for promotion based on RI 9W200 and
            select them for promotion upon reaching the average TIG of selectees in their
            CAFSC. The AFW2 must be eligible for promotion and meet minimum eligibility
            requirements as outlined in Table 2.1 to be considered for promotion.
            2.14.2.1.2. AFPC/DPSOE verifies AFW2 promotion eligibility and computes
            average TIG for selectees (last 5 cycles) in their CAFSC. If TIG as of the current
            PECD meets or exceeds the 5-cycle average, obtain AF/A1 approval of the
            promotion. The promotion DOR and effective date is the first day of the last month
            promotions would have increment for the specific cycle (previous cycles). For current
            cycle, the promotion DOR and effective date is the date the assigned PSN increments
            or the date AF/A1 approves promotion, whichever occurs first. In addition, AFW2
            promotion DOR and effective date will not include previous cycles where members
            were ineligible or non-selected for promotion. AFW2 promotion packages in this
            category require the wing commander’s recommendation and will be routed to AF/A1
            for approval. If promotions are approved by AF/A1, AFPC/DPSOE will make
            promotion notification to the AFW2’s wing and unit commander.
     2.14.3. Promotion to SMSgt and CMSgt will use the following procedures:
        2.14.3.1. Once awarded RI 9W200, AFPC/DPSOE will consider the AFW2 for
        promotion if the member is promotion eligible and tests. The member’s selection record
        will meet the promotion board and compete for promotion among other AFW2 personnel
        in their respective grade using WAPS eligibility factors. If the member is the only
        eligible AFW2, and is considered fully qualified by the promotion board, they will
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                               29


       receive a PSN and be promoted. AF/A1 and CMSAF, through AF/A1PPP, will be
       provided promotion results for AFW2 SMSgt and CMSgt selects prior to public release.
   2.14.4. Special consideration for promotion to SMSgt and CMSgt:
       2.14.4.1. The following promotion procedures will apply in rare cases where an AFW2
       Airmen is promotion eligible, but cannot WAPS test as documented by a competent
       medical authority due to catastrophic injuries. A catastrophic injury is defined as a
       permanent, severely disabling injury, disorder, or disease that compromises the ability to
       carry out the activities of daily living to such a degree that a Service Member or Veteran
       (SM/V) requires personal or mechanical assistance to leave home, bed, or requires
       constant supervision to avoid physical harm to self or others.
       2.14.4.2. An AFW2 who is unable to test as documented by competent medical authority
       will meet the promotion board and compete for promotion among other AFW2 personnel
       in their respective grade using WAPS eligibility factors who are unable to test. If the
       member is the only eligible AFW2, and is fully qualified by the promotion board, they
       will receive a PSN and be promoted. AF/A1 and CMSAF through AF/A1PPP, will be
       provided promotion results for AFW2 SMSgt and CMSgt selects prior to public release.
   2.14.5. Rare and exceptional cases may be considered as an exception to this policy by
   AF/A1 with CMSAF coordination.
2.15. Posthumous Promotions. Airmen due for promotion to grades Amn through SrA who
die within 30 days of their originally projected promotion date are eligible for posthumous
promotion. Airmen selected for promotion to grades SSgt through CMSgt who die before their
projected promotion date, are eligible for posthumous promotion. Such promotion is authorized
only if it is known the Airman would have been promoted under normal circumstances. The
MPS will publish special orders and email to: afpc.casdlist@randolph.af.mil immediately upon
notification. The actual date the Airman is declared deceased becomes the effective date cited in
the promotion order. No financial benefits accrue as a result of a posthumous promotion.
   2.15.1. WAPS tests will not be scored for Airmen in the grades of SrA through SMSgt who
   die prior to promotion release. WAPS scores are only releasable once considered a matter

AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                    31


1. Use this Table to determine standard minimum eligibility requirements for promotion
consideration. HQ USAF may announce additional eligibility requirements. The individual must
serve on enlisted AD and have continuous active duty as of PECD.
2. The high year of tenure (HYT) policy applicable as of PECD may affect promotion eligibility
in grades SrA and above.
3. Use years of satisfactory service for retirement in place of TAFMSD to determine promotion
eligibility for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Airmen ordered to active duty
EXCEPTION: Active Guard Reserve (AGR or Statutory tours). Reserve or Guard Airmen are
eligible for promotion if EAD is on or after PECD. ROTC disenrollees ordered to active duty in
the grade of A1C are required to serve a minimum of 12 months from EAD prior to pinning on
SrA.
4. A1Cs must meet skill level requirements by the effective date of promotion for SrA. However,
an A1C in lengthy tech school training, or in a hardship situation, who doesn’t possess the
minimum required PAFSC can be granted an exception to policy skill level waiver (SLW) to pin
on SrA. The technical training squadron commander or for Airmen in a hardship/medical
situation, the unit commander may submit a request for SLW stating the extenuating
circumstances (i.e., awaiting training, medical delays, etc.) to AFPC/DPSOE.
5. SrA must meet skill level requirements by the PECD for SSgt, except for those individuals in
PES ―Q.‖ SSgts test and compete for promotion to TSgt if they have a 5-skill level as of PECD;
however, they must have a 7-skill level before promotion. Commanders may waive the 7-skill
level requirement for TSgt selects (at the time when PSN is announced for promotion) when the
Airman has completed upgrade requirements and is waiting to attend, or is currently enrolled in,
the 7-level school. TSgts without the appropriate skill level are ineligible to test unless they have
a valid DIERT date. MSgts and SMSgt must meet minimum skill-level requirements listed
above. MSgt and SMSgt skill levels may be waived according to Table 2.3. to allow them to
compete for promotion. Demote Airmen promoted with a PAFSC waiver who fail to obtain or
maintain grade skill relationship as outlined in Chapter 6.
6. Airmen demoted to SrA who are past their HYT for that grade will have their HYT adjusted
based on TIG requirements only (reference AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen).
The HYT is adjusted regardless of whether or not they are eligible to compete for promotion.
The HYT date will be the 4th month after selections are made for the first SSgt promotion cycle
the Airman is TIG eligible. Airman will not be considered for promotion if ineligible according
to Table 1.1.
7. Service in a commissioned, warrant, or flight officer status is creditable for pay. Such service
does not count for this requirement (38 Comptroller General 598). Airmen may be considered for
promotion who meet this requirement on the 1st day of the last month promotions are normally
made in the cycle. Actual promotion does not occur earlier than the 1st day of the month
following the month the Airman completes the required enlisted service. This applies if the select
had a sequence number in an earlier promotion increment; however, if the Airman meets the
required enlisted service on the first day of the month, the DOR and effective date is that date.
8. If a TDY student meets the requirements of this table but does not maintain satisfactory
proficiency, the MPS that services the Airman's TDY unit informs the MPS servicing the
Airman's unit of assignment.

                                        time weighted factor for that specific report. The time
                                        weighting factor begins with 50 for the most recent
                                        report and decreases in increments of 5 (50-45-40-35-30-
                                        25-20-15-10-5) for each report on file. Periods of

                                        4B, 5B. Multiply that product by the Enlisted
                                        Performance Report conversion factor of 27 for each
                                        report. Repeat this step for each report. After calculating
                                        each report, add the total value of each report for a sum.
                                        Divide that sum by the sum of the time weighted factors
                                        added together for the promotion performance factor.

    AFSC, to another AFSC
NOTES:
1. Do not allow prior service enlistees and former officers skill level waivers except as indicated
in paragraph 2.12.
2. Process PAFSC skill-level waivers as outlined in AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Military
Personnel Flight (MPF) Management and Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) User
Guidelines.
3. Airmen in these RIs as of the PECD must meet skill levels established by the Air Force
Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). Airmen who fail to meet the requirements imposed by
the unit commander are ineligible for a skill-level waiver. Airmen with these RIs as their PAFSC
must meet the skill-level criteria indicated on the certificate from AFTAC. An Airman must have
the certificate before promotion to MSgt.
4. Since the majority of Airmen are in a retraining status (SSgt through MSgt) and promotion to
SMSgt and CMSgt are routinely approved for a PAFSC skill-level waiver, the promotion record
is built as "eligible" during the promotion file build. The promotion authority may still deny the
Airman promotion consideration by disapproving a PAFSC skill-level waiver.
5. Normally, do not permit Airmen in normal upgrade training a skill-level waiver. Grant PAFSC
skill level-waivers before PECD for significant documented interruptions (beyond the Airman’s
control) in current training that prevents the Airman from upgrading.

      qualified (see Para 2.6.1.5.)

NOTES:
1. Consider Airmen who are SKT exempt for promotion in one of two promotion AFSCs, one for
non-chronic critical skills (non-CCS) and another for CCS. When there is not an SKT for the
specialty, then all Airmen in that AFSC compete for promotion together, regardless of their
training status (i.e., retrainees, etc.). All Airmen who are SKT exempt and are in an AFSC where
an SKT exists can take the SKT by signing a statement. Once signed, do not reverse the decision
without unit commander and MPS commander concurrence. Once the promotion test is
administered, do not reverse the decision. Refer to TCO memorandums for other SKT
exemptions.
2. Airmen must fulfill PAFSC skill-level requirements according to Table 2.3.
3. Allow Airmen who return to a previously awarded AFSC for which they are not assigned
within the last year and do not have the required skill level (SrA = 5 level, SSgt = 7 level, &
TSgt = 7 level) a 24-month SKT exemption. Update a DIERT date equal to the date the Airman
returned to the previous AFSC. Approve a PAFSC skill-level waiver according to Table 2.3.
4. Allow SKT exemptions for 24 months regardless of training status. Airmen can elect to take
the SKT by signing a statement. Do not reverse the Airman's decision to take, or not to take, the
SKT without unit commander and MPS commander concurrence. Do not reverse the decision
once the promotion test is administered.
5. MPS updates MilPDS Training Status Code (TSC) "I" with a Date Initially Entered Retraining
(DIERT) equal to the date of return into the previous awarded AFSC (ref AFI 36-2101,
Classifying Military Personnel [Officers and Enlisted]) if within 6 months of PECD. Airmen
may elect to take the SKT. Do not place prior service Airmen or former officers in TSC "I".

1. Do not allow supplemental consideration for Airmen needing more than the maximum board
score (450 points) for selection.
2. Credit is given if the Airman takes the end of course (EOC) examination on or before the
PECD and successfully completes the course, even if it is not scored until after the PECD (HAF
files will not change, only the promotion and WAPS Information Retrieval [WIRE] files). PME
was last used for CMSgt during cycle 94E9 and for SMSgt during cycle 96E8.
3. Mandatory scoring eliminates the need for optional review; the record goes directly to a
supplemental panel to score the record.
4. Prior to rescoring the record, the panel considers the type of error, the degree of impact on the
promotion score, and the number of points needed for selection. Those records the panel
considers but chooses not to rescore are rendered nonselects.

                                           Chapter 3

SENIOR NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER EVALUATION/SUPPLEMENTAL BOARD
                         PROCEDURES

3.1. General. This chapter provides guidance and outlines operating procedures to be used in
the administration and conduct of central senior noncommissioned officer evaluation and
supplemental boards for the United States Air Force at the Headquarters Air Force Personnel
Center, USAF Selection Board Secretariat. Selection Board Secretariat personnel are
responsible for conducting central evaluation and supplemental boards for promotions to both
Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant on the active duty list.
3.2. Responsibilities. Board members and alternate board members should familiarize
themselves with applicable portions of this instruction. Board members will be provided a link to
the site that contains this AFI in their board member notification letter. Alternate board members
will remain on stand-by for the duration of the board.
3.3. Board Membership. Board membership will reflect the eligible population in terms of
minority and women, MAJCOM of assignment, and career area. Career areas are broken into
four categories: Support, Operations, Maintenance, and Medical. The largest AFSCs within each
career area garner a board member.
3.4. Board Organization. Boards will be constructed with a Board President (at least a
Brigadier General) and at least one panel. Panels will consist of one colonel (current or
―graduated‖ group commander) and two chief master sergeants from the same career area
(defined in paragraph 3.3). AFSCs and CEM codes will be scored by panels with
representatives from the AFSCs or CEM codes under consideration or from the same career area
as those being evaluated. All members of an AFSC or CEM code will be evaluated by the same
three board members.
3.5. Board Member Preparation. The Selection Board Secretariat will pre-brief the Board
President (BP) on the board agenda, Formal Charge, BP responsibilities, and the trial run
exercise (practice scoring session). Board recorders will conduct the first day administrative
briefing to the board. The BP will then read the Formal Charge verbatim to the board and a copy
will be provided to each board member. Each board member will initial a copy of the Formal
Charge to be maintained in the permanent record. Oaths are administered to board members and
to the recorders and administrative staff. A trial run exercise will then be conducted to
familiarize board members with the selection records and situations the board may encounter
during actual scoring.
3.6. Scoring Records. Board scores are based upon the material in each SNCO’s
Noncommissioned Officer Selection Record (NSR). Board members will not have access to
objective WAPS data to include USAFSE scores.
   3.6.1. Board members will assign each eligible SNCO a board score reflecting their
   assessment of relative leadership potential. Select/Non-Select decisions are made based upon
   the totality of the eligible’s scores in WAPS, not just their board score. (See AFI 36-2502,
   Table 2.2).
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                     39


   3.6.2. Scoring is by secret ballot and without benefit of discussion, unless a significant
   disagreement (a "split") occurs in the scores on a particular record.
       3.6.2.1. If a board member identifies a record-based matter that causes concern, he/she
       will surface the matter to the Board Recorder who will discuss it with the BP. The BP
       may approve bringing that matter to the attention of the board members. Such records
       may be rescored after discussion.
       3.6.2.2. Board members may discuss their own personal knowledge and evaluation of the
       professional qualifications of eligible SNCOs as long as they discuss only matters
       documented in the NSR.
       3.6.2.3. Board members may not discuss or disclose the opinion of any person not a
       member of the board concerning the member.
3.7. Scoring Scale. Boards will use the following scale:

                      Score                             Potential
                      10.0                              Absolutely superior
                      9.5                               Outstanding
                      9.0                               Few could be better
                      8.5                               Strong
                      8.0                               Slightly above average
                      7.5                               Average
                      7.0                               Slightly below average
                      6.5                               Well below average
                      6.0                               Lowest

3.8. Defining "Splits". A "split" is a significant disagreement between board members about
the score of a record. A "split" is considered a difference in a score of 1.5 or more points between
any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 7.5, or 8 and 9.5).
3.9. Resolving "Splits". All scoring stops and all voting panel members must be present and
may discuss the records involved in a "split." Only panel members with split scores may change
their scores in the process of resolving a split. A "split" is resolved when there is a difference in a
score of 1.0 or less points between any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 7.0, or 8 and 8.5).
3.10. New Documents. If new information (e.g., decoration citation, enlisted performance
report, updated SNCO evaluation brief) concerning individual records is acquired during scoring,
the affected records will be brought back to the panel for rescoring. New documents will not be
accepted after the panel has adjourned.
3.11. Not Fully Qualified (NFQ) for Promotion. Board members are charged to identify any
SNCO who, in their opinion, is not fully qualified for advancement to the next higher grade.
Board members, when assessing the Airman’s record, may recommend to the board president the
Airman be rendered NFQ for promotion if, in their evaluation, they do not believe the Airman
has demonstrated the potential for advancement. NFQ is a mechanism designed to preclude
promotion by default in small career fields; however, it should not normally be used to supplant
 40                       AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


the 6 to 10 scoring methodology with a pass-fail methodology. It should not be used to ―send‖ a
message to the eligible or the eligible’s chain of command.
   3.11.1. The board president will review the record of any Airman a panel renders NFQ. If
   the board president believes the record has been inconsistently scored, the board president
   may send the record back to the panel for verification. Although a board member’s rationale
   for determining an eligible to be NFQ is not releasable, he/she should be prepared to explain
   the logic behind the decision to the BP. Those individuals which a majority of the panel
   believes are NFQ are identified as such in the board report and are not considered for
   promotion.
   3.11.2. For those AFSCs with only one Airman eligible and that Airman is rendered NFQ,
   the AFSC will be deactivated from the promotion cycle.
   3.11.3. AFPC/PB provides a list of Airmen rendered NFQ by the board to AFPC/DPSOE. If
   the board determines an Airman is NFQ based on an evaluation of the record, the Airman is
   rendered ineligible for the promotion cycle.
3.12. BP Quality Review. In order to assure consistency of scoring, the Board President
reviews records from each AFSC or CEM code under consideration. To do this, the Board
Secretariat takes the following actions:
   3.12.1. Prior to the board, the staff works with the Enlisted Promotion & Military Testing
   Branch and the Air Staff to determine (as closely as possible) the number of projected
   promotions, as well as those AFSCs and CEM codes on the Chronic Critical Shortage Skills
   Listing for that promotion cycle.
   3.12.2. After the panel finishes scoring each AFSC or CEM code, the Board Secretariat staff
   will produce the board score relative order of merit listing for the specialty. They will then
   identify the area on the order of merit corresponding to the projected promotion quota for
   that specialty by:
       3.12.2.1. Drawing a line at the score category that comes closest to fulfilling the
       projected quota without exceeding it.
       3.12.2.2. Drawing another line one score category lower on the order of merit.
       3.12.2.3. The Board President will then receive the following: a representative sampling
       of records directly above, below, and in the identified area; the highest scoring record in
       the specialty; and any records found to be NFQ by the panel.
       3.12.2.4. During his/her review, if the Board President believes one or more records
       from this sampling were scored inconsistently, he/she then reviews all records from the
       affected score categories involved and may direct rescore of any record he/she deems fit.
       The BP will review the resulting scores and determine whether the first score or the
       rescore shall be the final score for the record (the BP may only direct one rescore for a
       particular considered).
3.13. Board Report. AFPC/PB prepares board proceeding reports and handles as FOR
OFFICIAL USE ONLY, under provisions of DoD Regulation 5400.7-R/AF Supplement, DoD
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program, and retains them for the period specified in the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule, available on-line at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                   41


   3.13.1. Provides a board report to AFPC/DPSOE, Enlisted Promotion and Military Testing
   Branch, which will discuss the proceedings of the board and identify those SNCOs found to
   be not fully qualified for promotion. Board scores will flow electronically into WAPS from
   the boardroom. All board members, recorders, and administrative assistants/support
   personnel will sign the board report.
3.14. Outbrief Board Members. Recorders outbrief board members on the rules of disclosure
of board proceedings, providing some cautions about what can and cannot be discussed as well
as collecting all notes. It is important that personal observations not jeopardize the credibility of
the board process and that Airmen receive a consistent Air Force message.
   3.14.1. The Selection Board Secretariat staff will inform board members and administrative
   assistants that all involved with the board process are prohibited from ever sharing their
   observations of board proceedings i.e., how many members voted, discussions about
   members’ records, lists or statistics of results, who served on which panel.
   3.14.2. Board members and administrative assistants are encouraged to use the briefing
   slides provided by the Board Secretariat Staff to brief the board process and structure i.e.,
   numbers considered, board organization, steps followed.
3.15. Board Anomalies. Procedural anomalies occurring during a board that may require
variation from established procedures require BP resolution. During the board, the BP may bring
any matter to the attention of the CSAF or AFPC/CC, if he or she determines that such decision
is required. The need for an alternate board member being called to replace a primary board
member will be treated as an anomaly and will follow guidelines specified in this paragraph. The
Board President will make determinations on availability of a primary board member and an
alternate board member and is the authorizing official for directing that an AFPC/CC-approved
alternate replace a board member.
3.16. Supplemental Boards. The following differences in procedure apply to supplemental
boards:
   3.16.1. Board Organization. Boards will be constructed with a Board President (at least a
   Brigadier General) and at least one panel. Each panel will be composed of a board member
   from one of the four career areas. For example, one panel could have a maintenance group
   commander, a personnel chief master sergeant, and a supply chief master sergeant. Panels
   will not be confined to scoring specific AFSCs or CEMs. Similarly, one panel will not
   necessarily see all the records from a specific AFSC or CEM.
   3.16.2. Determining Select/Non-Select Status. HQ AFPC/DPSOE determines what board
   score an eligible would have needed in order to beat the promotion cutoff from the original
   board. See paragraph 2.7.
       3.16.3.1. An eligible SNCOs record is compared to benchmark records. Benchmark
       records are: three records with the same required score as identified in paragraph 3.16.3
       (―plus‖ benchmark) and three records a half point below (―minus‖ benchmark). All
       records are ―aged‖ to appear as they would have on the original board, and all records are
       scored together.
       3.16.3.2. The panel compares the supplemental record against the benchmarked records
       to determine selection status.

       3.16.3.3. An eligible is a ―Select‖ if he/she outscores all ―minus‖ benchmarks and ties or
       outscores at least one of the ―plus‖ benchmarks. Unlike evaluation boards, there is no
       quota on supplemental boards. The decision tree at Figure 1 will be used to determine
       select/non-select status.
   3.16.4. Differentials. When benchmark records are not available at the required ―minus‖
   scores, HQ AFPC/DPSOE will go to the next available lower score categories for ―minus‖
   benchmarks. When this occurs, the point differential (difference between the required
   benchmark score and the actual benchmarks used) must be accounted for when applying the
   decision tree. The differential will not exceed ± 3 points.
   3.16.5. Inversion. Some degree of inversion is to be expected. Only the most extreme cases
   warrant a potential rescore of the records. The enlisted supplemental decision tree outlines
   those cases and directs when a rescore is allowed, subject to BP approval.
   3.16.6. New Documents. New documents are not applicable in the supplemental process.

Figure 3.1. SNCO Supplemental Decision Tree.




3.17. Disclosure of Board Proceedings. The list of board members will be released in
conjunction with the release of the board results (approximately 3-4 weeks following board
adjournment). At that time, board members may discuss the board process and procedures,
board organization, and the number of eligibles considered. Board members may never disclose
how board members voted, who sat on each panel, or what AFSCs they scored. In addition, they
may not keep lists or statistics from the board. Board members are also prohibited from
discussing their personal observations about the strengths and weaknesses in the records. .
3.18. Summary. These selection board procedures were developed to give all eligible SNCOs
fair and equitable consideration, not for ease of administration. While it in many ways mirrors
the officer selection board process, SNCO evaluation boards are not governed by law and are not
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                               43


the sole determinant of promotion and as such bear significant differences. These procedures will
remain in effect until otherwise modified in writing.

                                           Chapter 4

                   ACTIVE DUTY AIRMAN PROMOTION ACTIONS

4.1. Officer Training Candidates:
   4.1.1. MPS:
   4.1.2. Notify Airmen they are ineligible for promotion consideration when entering Air
   Force commissioning programs on or before PECD. If Airmen enter an Air Force
   commissioning program after PECD but before selections are made, they will not be
   considered for promotion.
   4.1.3. Promote Airmen entering the Airman Education and Commissioning Program
   (AECP), Officer Training School (OTS), Nurse Enlisted Commissioning Program (NECP),
   Physician Assistant (PA) or Academy of Military Science (AMS) programs as follows:
      4.1.3.1. Promote Airmen in grades SrA and below to SSgt effective 1 day before their
      scheduled PCS or TDY departure.
      4.1.3.2. Airmen entering AECP, OTS or NECP with a projected promotion to TSgt or
      above will retain PSN and be promoted when incremented regardless of whether it occurs
      before or after the Airman enters the commissioning program.
   4.1.4. Promote Airmen selected for the Air Force Academy with a PSN before entry. Do not
   promote Airmen with PSNs after program entry; place memorandums in their records to
   show selected grade, cycle, and PSN. Prior service disenrolled Airmen receive their former
   grade and DOR with the effective date as the disenrolled date; second year disenrolled
   Airmen receive the grade determined by AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank.
      4.1.5. Demote eliminated Airmen to their former grades per Chapter 6, and then
      promote them to the highest grades entitled effective the day following demotions. The
      DOR of the higher grades are the original DORs (AFI 36-2014, Commissioning
      Education).
   4.1.6. Notify Airmen promotion eligibility may be reinstated (see paragraph 4.3) if they are
   eliminated from training through no fault of their own. The training facility commander must
   make a recommendation for reinstatement.
   4.1.7. Discharge Airmen selected for the Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program
   (ASCP) and enlist them into the AF Reserves. Airmen with PSNs that increment prior to
   entry into ASCP will be authorized to assume the grade. Place memos with PSNs in the
   records of Airmen who have PSNs that will increment after entry (listing grade and cycle).
   For those who do not complete ASCP, see AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank, to
   determine active duty grade and DOR.
   4.1.8. Airmen selected for the Technical Degree Scholarship Program (TDSP) will enlist in
   the Regular Air Force for a period of 48 months, serve in the grade of A1C while completing
   the degree requirement, and receive basic pay and privileges of that grade. These Airmen are
   not entitled to promotion to SrA or SrA BTZ while completing the TDSP academic phase.
   After completion of the degree requirement, Airmen will attend OTS and will be promoted to
   SSgt effective 1 day before departure, but no earlier than 11th day before report no later than
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                45


   date. On graduation from OTS, Airmen will be discharged from enlisted status and tendered
   a commission as a Regular officer in the United States Air Force in the grade of second
   lieutenant.
      4.1.8.1. Eliminees from the TDSP academic phase will choose a 4-year commission or a
      2-year enlistment. 2-year enlistees entitled to a grade higher than A1C due to prior
      service will require grade and service date verification to determine the appropriate grade
      and DOR the Airman is entitled to. 2-year enlistees with no prior service will be
      promoted to A1C with a DOR equal to the Basic Military Training start date.
   4.1.9. ROTC disenrollees will serve a 2-year enlistment and will be accessed to the
   appropriate grade prior to entering active duty. Airmen will receive a DOR equal to date of
   entry into the ROTC program and an effective date equal to the date of entry to active duty
   (EAD).
      4.1.9.1. After accessed, Airmen are authorized one promotion to Amn or A1C base on
      the TIG requirements in paragraph 2.1. Consecutive promotions based on the accessed
      grade and DOR prior to EAD are not authorized (Airmen cannot be promoted from AB to
      A1C). Accessed A1Cs are required to serve a minimum of 12 months from EAD prior to
      pinning on SrA.
4.2. Nonrecommending, Deferring, and Withholding Promotions. The action may be
initiated and approved by the unit commander for Airman in the grades AB - TSgt. The
nonrecommendation, deferral, or withhold can be initiated by the unit commander, but is
approved by the promotion authority for Airmen in grades MSgt and SMSgt (see paragraph
1.4).
   4.2.1. Unit Commanders:
      4.2.1.1. Inform Airmen of adverse actions in writing or verbally before promotion
      effective date (confirm verbal notification in writing within 5 duty days). The notification
      memorandum must include reasons, dates, occurrences, and duration of the action. If the
      Airman is notified verbally prior to effective date, and written notification is followed up
      after effective date of promotion, include a statement confirming the Airman was
      verbally notified not to assume the higher grade prior to the effective date of promotion.
      For actions on those in grades SrA through SMSgt, include the affected promotion cycle.
      4.2.1.2. Obtain the Airmen’s written acknowledgment.
      4.2.1.3. Forward the written notification to the MPS to send for file in the Airman’s
      ARMS record and updates MilPDS.
   4.2.2. Nonrecommending Promotion. Nonrecommendation for promotion should be used
   when an Airman’s behavior does not adhere to established standards. Promotion
   reinstatement is not authorized. For promotion nonrecommendation actions/ineligibility
   conditions:
      4.2.2.1. Separate written nonrecommendations are not required for Airmen otherwise
      ineligible according to Table 1.1 (except for Rule 9, where the ineligibility condition is
      specifically ―nonrecommendation for promotion‖).
46                       AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


     4.2.2.2. A1Cs and below, ineligible for promotion under Table 1.1 (except for Rule 9),
     will become eligible for promotion upon completion of the ineligibility condition if
     otherwise eligible and recommended by the commander.
     4.2.2.3. Promotion DOR will be the date the Airman became eligible and the effective
     date will be the date of written recommendation by the commander for those exceeding
     TIG/TIS requirements. A retroactive promotion effective date may be requested
     according to paragraph 1.13.
     4.2.2.4. Nonrecommend A1Cs and below in monthly increments up to 6 months (Table
     1.1, Rule 9).
         4.2.2.4.1. Promotion DOR and effective date will be the anniversary day of the
         original promotion date, but only if the anniversary day falls after the date the
         commander recommends promotion in writing. EXAMPLE: If DOR to Amn is 9 Mar
         06 and commander recommends promotion in writing 10 Mar 07 or later, then DOR
         to A1C is 9 Apr 07; if commander recommends promotion in writing 8 Mar 07 or
         earlier, then DOR to A1C is 9 Mar 07.
         4.2.2.4.2. Six-year enlistees with a contract guaranteeing A1C upon completion of
         Basic Military Training and Technical Training who are nonrecommended for
         promotion will have their contract voided.
         4.2.2.4.3. Remove BTZ selects from a selection list and inform them they remain
         ineligible until fully qualified (see paragraph 2.2).
     4.2.2.5. Nonrecommendation for Airmen in grades SrA and above (for pin-on or testing)
     only applies for one promotion cycle at a time.
         4.2.2.5.1. MPS must send a copy of the nonrecommendation to HQ AFPC/DPSOE
         when the promotion authority (see paragraph 1.4) approves the nonrecommendation
         for promotion (to include testing) for a MSgt or SMSgt.
  4.2.3. Deferring Promotion. Deferring a promotion delays the promotion and pay past the
  original effective date to allow the commander to determine if the Airman meets acceptable
  behavior or performance standards. For deferring promotion to SSgt through CMSgt:
     4.2.3.1. The deferral duration is for 1 to 3 months.
     4.2.3.2. Wing or equivalent level commanders may approve deferring promotion beyond
     3 months for SSgt through MSgt. Equivalent level commander is the first senior rater in
     a commander’s position in the Airman’s reporting chain.
     4.2.3.3. The promotion authority (see paragraph 1.4) approves deferring promotions to
     SMSgt and CMSgt beyond 3 months.
     4.2.3.4. The promotion authority must make a promotion decision, in writing, upon
     completion of the deferral period. DOR and effective date is the 1st day of the month
     after the deferral period ends and cannot be retroactive.
  4.2.4. Withholding Promotion. Commanders must be advised withholding a promotion is not
  used as a punishment or inducement for an Airman to conform to acceptable standards of
  performance. Withholding action is taken after promotion selection but before the effective
  date of promotion. For withholding promotions:
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                              47


       4.2.4.1. The promotion of any Airman is withheld when he or she possesses any of the
       conditions listed in Table 1.2. Written commander notifications are required for all
       conditions listed in Table 1.2. Commanders will clearly state specific reasons for all
       withholding actions. MPS will return memorandums not stating the specific reasons for
       withholding actions to commanders and reference this paragraph.
       4.2.4.2. Wing or equivalent level commanders may approve withholding promotions
       longer than 1 year. Equivalent level commander is the first senior rater in a commander’s
       position in the Airman’s reporting chain.
       4.2.4.3. The unit commander may initiate, approve, and terminate withhold action for
       periods of less than 1 year for promotion to A1C through CMSgt. The promotion
       authority (see paragraph 1.4) approves withholding promotions to SMSgt and CMSgt
       for periods longer than 1 year.
       4.2.4.4. Airmen receive their original DOR; the effective date is the date the commander
       terminates the withhold action and recommends promotion. See paragraph 1.13 for
       corrections to effective dates.
       4.2.4.5. Airmen whose promotions were withheld, and later changed to a deferral, will
       receive a DOR no later than the 1st day of the third month after the original promotion
       effective date. NOTE: Wing/CC or equivalent must approve deferring promotion beyond
       3 months.
4.3. Promotion Reinstatement. This procedure only applies to Airmen removed from the
control roster or who completed Article 15 suspended reduction. Reinstatement includes
promotion testing, consideration for promotion if tests are on file, or for previous selects who
become ineligible.
   4.3.1. Wing or equivalent level commander (equivalent level commander is the first senior
   rater in a commander’s position in the Airman’s reporting chain) may approve:
   (EXCEPTION: Reinstatement to the grades of SMSgt and CMSgt must be forwarded to the
   promotion authority (see paragraph 1.4).
       4.3.1.1. For reinstatement requests for Airmen who were found ineligible because their
       records had incomplete or wrong data, the DOR is the date of original increment and
       effective date is date of reinstatement approval. Individuals may request a retroactive
       promotion effective date according to paragraph 1.13.
   4.3.2. Commanders:
       4.3.2.1. Should initiate reinstatement requests for Airmen ineligible for promotion to
       grades SSgt through CMSgt for only the most deserving cases (including Airmen who
       were selects), and send reinstatement requests through the MPS for processing.
       4.3.2.2. Requests for reinstatement should not be approved solely because commanders
       reverse decisions that originally rendered Airmen ineligible.
   4.3.3. DOR and effective date for approved promotion sequence number (PSN)
   reinstatements to grades SSgt through CMSgt are the 1st day of the month following the
   month the commander initiated reinstatement action if promotion increment has passed. MPS
   send a copy of the reinstatement to HQ AFPC/DPSOE providing the Airman’s name, SSN,
   cycle, date commander initiated reinstatement, date reinstatement was approved, and
 48                       AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


   circumstances surrounding the reinstatement. HQ AFPC/DPSOE will provide testing
   instructions if tests were not previously administered supplemental consideration if tests are
   on file, or update grade data in MilPDS if the Airman was a previous select.
   4.3.4. An Airman or the Airman’s unit commander may request reinstatement for reasons
   not covered above as an exception to policy. This exception is not intended for use as a
   rehabilitative tool for improved behavior. Exception to policy requests should be limited to
   those extreme cases that warrant reinstatement. MPS forward fully documented exception to
   policy requests through the Airman’s wing commander, or the promotion authority for
   SMSgt and CMSgt, to HQ AFPC/DPSOE for final decision. All levels of command may
   disapprove these requests and discontinue further processing. The DOR and effective date for
   approved exception to policy reinstatements to grades SSgt through CMSgt are the 1st day of
   the month following the month the commander initiated reinstatement action.
4.4. Applying for Correction of Records. Airmen who believe they have suffered injustice in
their promotion consideration are encouraged to exhaust all administrative remedies prior to
applying to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) under the
provisions of AFI 36-2603, AFBCMR. The application for correction of military records should
be filed within 3 years after discovering the alleged error or injustice; however, the AFBCMR
may waive untimely filing in the interest of justice.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                49

 PREMIER BAND ENLISTED PROMOTION AND PROPRIETY REVIEW PROCESS

5.1. Premier Bands. The United States Air Force Band (The USAF Band), Bolling AFB, DC,
and The United States Air Force Academy Band (The USAFA Band), Peterson AFB, CO.
5.2. Background. To support CONUS and worldwide mission requirements, Premier Bands
access fully qualified professional musicians. Premier Band members are by-pass specialists
who do not enter into formal upgrade training to attain craftsman (7-skill level) designation. Air
Force Premier Bands compete with the other services' premier bands and the civilian sector in
recruiting fully qualified professional musicians. While assigned to an Air Force Premier Band,
members are deferred from rotational PCS moves. Special enlisted promotion authority is
granted only for band members assigned to Premier Bands because:
   5.2.1. Recruiting fully qualified professional musicians saves training costs and time.
   5.2.2. Recruiting and retaining fully qualified professional musicians to Premier Bands
   requires an incentive.
   5.2.3. Members are deferred from rotational PCS moves and must compete for promotion to
   internal vacancies rather than external quotas.
5.3. Promotion Authority. The AFDW/CC and the USAFA/CC are the USAF Band and
USAFA Band promotion authority, respectively.
5.4. Promotion Objective. The objective of the Premier Band promotion process is to fill
existing and forecasted vacancies based on authorized unit manning with the best-qualified
candidates. All assigned members who have shown potential for increased responsibility and
meet the minimum eligibility requirements will be considered for promotion.
   5.4.1. Due to the highly specialized nature of positions in the Premier Bands, The USAF
   Band and The USAFA Band conduct separate promotion processes based on internal unit
   vacancies. Promotion to TSgt is effective upon the day the member first reports for duty
   with a Premier Band and requires the approval of the promotion authority or their designated
   representative. There are no TIS or TIG requirements.
   5.4.2. Promotion to the grades of Master Sergeant (MSgt), Senior Master Sergeant (SMSgt),
   and Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt) are made one grade at a time to an existing vacancy. The
   number of personnel selected for promotion is based on existing and forecasted vacancies for
   each unit during the promotion cycle under consideration. All selects not promoted prior to
   the end of the promotion cycle will be promoted the first day of the following month.
5.5. Premier Band Promotion Cycle. The promotion eligibility cutoff date (PECD) for all
cycles is 31 March. Promotion testing for Premier Band members will be conducted during
normal scheduled Air Force promotion testing cycles. Promotion boards will meet in the month
of June and evaluate the selection records for all eligible members for MSgt, SMSgt and CMSgt.
Promotion dates begin on 1 August and end on 31 July of the following year. AFDW/A1 and
USAFA/DP will provide their respective eligible members a copy of the promotion fact sheet.
5.6. Promotion Quotas. Promotion quotas for each grade are determined for each Premier
Band by AFDW/A1 and USAFA/DP respectively, based on existing and forecasted vacancies
 50                        AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


during the promotion cycle as of 31 May. A vacancy is defined as an existing unfilled
authorization. A forecasted vacancy is defined as an authorization which will become unfilled as
a result of retirement, separation, PCS, etc., during the promotion cycle. Unforecasted vacancies
which occur after 31 May are not added to the promotion quota.
5.7. Eligibility Requirements. To be eligible for promotion under this authority, members
must possess Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC) and Duty Air Force Specialty Code
(DAFSC) 3N2X1. To be eligible for the next higher grade, members of Premier Bands must
meet minimum time in service and time in grade requirements (see Table 5.1).
   5.7.1. Eligibility for PFE/USAFSE Testing. Due to the variation between Air Force PECDs
   and Premier Band PECDs, different criteria must be used to determine eligibility to test. To
   be eligible to test for the next higher grade, members of Premier Bands must meet the
   eligibility requirements in Table 5.1 and must not be declared ineligible on the basis of
   Table 5.2.
5.8. Deferring, Withhold and NonRecommending Promotions. Band members must be
recommended for promotion by their respective Premier Band Commander. The commander will
forward the eligibility/ineligibility roster to the command A1 or DP staff no later than 15 April.
See paragraph 3.2 for nonrecommending, deferring, and withholding promotions.
5.9. Data Collection and Verification. Upon PECD, the command A1 or DP staffs will initiate
actions to begin the promotion consideration process.
   5.9.1. By 15 April, each eligible member should verify their Promotion Data Verification
   Brief (DVB) by logging into vMPF on the HQ AFPC web page. Members must identify any
   discrepancies on the DVB to their respective servicing Military Personnel Flight or Base
   Education Office.
5.10. The Promotion Board. The promotion board is an essential element in the Premier Band
promotion process. Selection records are evaluated based on the whole person concept with a
450 points maximum board score. All eligible members will have their selection record reviewed
and scored by the promotion board.
   5.10.1. The promotion board will be chaired by a General Officer or Brigadier General
   Select (if a General Officer is unavailable, a colonel may chair the promotion board). The
   three voting members of the promotion board will be a colonel from a non band AFSC, a
   CMSgt from a non band AFSC and a CMSgt band manager who is not and has not been
   assigned as a member of the respective Premier Band. The promotion board members will be
   nominated by the respective command A1 or DP staff and appointed by the promotion
   authority. No board members will serve on consecutive boards and no member assigned to
   The USAF Band or The USAFA Band will be appointed to their respective promotion board.
5.11. Determining Selects, Promotion Sequence Numbers and Establishing Dates of
Rank. Promotion selections are based on the promotion quota (see paragraph 5.6). AFDW/A1
and USAFA/DP will release promotion sequence numbers. Selects are promoted in sequence to
the first available vacancies at the appropriate grade until all selects are promoted. Unfilled
vacancies are carried over to the next promotion cycle.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                             51


   5.11.1. Promotion Dates of Rank. When vacancies occur on the first day of the month,
   promotions are made on that day. When vacancies occur after the first day of the month,
   promotions are made on the first day of the following month.
5.12. Selection List. The promotion selection list is prepared by the respective command A1 or
DP staff and routed to the promotion authority for final approval.
5.13. Supplemental Promotions. Current Air Force policy will be used when determining
supplemental consideration. Each individual must submit a request for supplemental
consideration in writing to their command A1or DP.
   5.13.1. The three voting members of the supplemental promotion board will consist of the
   Chief of Air Force Enlisted Evaluations and Promotion Policy (HQ USAF/A1PPP), a
   Colonel and another CMSgt. The respective command A1 or DP will appoint and convene
   the panel.
5.14. Promotion Propriety Review. As stated in paragraph 5.2, members of Premier Bands
are fully qualified professional musicians and are granted the privilege of promotion under the
authority of this instruction while assigned to a Premier Band. In order to be assigned to a
Premier Band, each member underwent an extensive audition and interview process. Should the
member fail to continue to meet these high standards, they may be involuntarily removed from
the organization. Any member determined by the commander to have failed to maintain Premier
Band standards can voluntarily apply for retraining into a different Air Force Specialty. Any
member may also request a voluntary reassignment. A grade determination will be conducted
through the Promotion Propriety Review Board (see paragraph 5.14.2) for members being
reassigned voluntarily or involuntarily from a Premier Band. Members voluntarily or
involuntarily released from the band will be reclassified in accordance with AFI 36-2101,
Classifying Military Personnel (Officers and Enlisted).
   5.14.1. Statement of Understanding. Members will be required to sign the Statement of
   Understanding (see Attachment 2) as part of their in-processing when first assigned to a
   Premier Band. This will be filed in the member's Personnel Information File (PIF).
   5.14.2. Promotion Propriety Review Board. The function of the Promotion Propriety Review
   Board is to perform a grade propriety review (GPR) on enlisted members of a Premier Band
   who will be reassigned to a new career field or to a non-Premier band. Members assigned to
   a new career field will be assigned in accordance with AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
   Personnel (Officers and Enlisted). The assessment process seeks to determine the grade
   and/or date of rank (DOR) appropriate to the member upon entry into the new career field or
   change of assignment.
       5.14.2.1. Promotion Propriety Review Board Members. For The USAF Band, the HQ
       AFDW/CV (or their appointed colonel designate), The USAF Band Commander and HQ
       AFDW/CCC (or their appointed CMSgt designate) will comprise the Promotion
       Propriety Review Board. For The USAFA Band, the HQ USAFA/DP, USAFA/DPX and
       The USAFA Band Commander will comprise the Promotion Propriety Review Board. A
       representative from the respective command A1or DP staff will serve as the facilitator
       and a member from the respective Premier Band will serve as the technical
       representative.
52                      AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


     5.14.2.2. Review Package. The respective command A1 or DP staff will prepare a
     review package, to be used by the Promotion Propriety Review Board, as the basis for its
     assessment. As a minimum, the review package should contain data comparing the
     member under review to the USAF at large and the new career field (average Air Force
     time-in-grade and time-in-service phase points), Individual Data Review RIP, Security
     Clearance Eligibility Record, Assignment Notification, PCS orders to the Premier Band,
     copies of all performance reports, copies of all award citations and a copy of the signed
     ―Statement of Understanding.‖ NOTE: The member under review may submit, in
     writing, their own assessment to their respective command A1 or DP staff for inclusion in
     the review package. This written assessment should address the factors in the board’s
     decision.
     5.14.2.3. The senior board member will forward the board’s recommendation to the
     command A1 or DP, who will forward it to the Band Career Field manager (SAF/PAR)
     for coordination no later than 90 days prior to the member’s departure for the new
     assignment. In turn, SAF/PAR will forward the board’s recommendation to HQ
     USAF/A1PPP for final determination and approval. HQ USAF/A1PPP will inform the
     command A1 or DP of its decision. The Premier Band Commander may verbally inform
     the member of the board’s recommendation upon completion of the propriety review.
  5.14.3. Each respective command A1 or DP will notify the Premier Band Commander of the
  final determination made by HQ USAF/A1PPP. The commander will immediately notify the
  member in writing of the GPR determination by memorandum. The commander will
  forward a copy of the notification memorandum to the command A1 or DP staff for inclusion
  in the member’s UPRG. The command A1 or DP staff will ensure demotion/date of rank
  adjustment orders are completed and distributed appropriately (i.e., gaining MPE, member,
  HQ AFPC/DPSOE). Grade and DOR changes take effect on the day the member arrives at
  their new duty station (Date Arrived Station).
  5.14.4. GPR Objective. The GPR will be based on the whole person concept. As a
  minimum, the Promotion Propriety Review Board should consider the following factors:
     5.14.4.1. Has the member received the proper training to serve in the new career field at
     the rank which they presently hold?
     5.14.4.2. Does the member have the kinds of duty experiences at the grade level
     commensurate with the new career field position?
     5.14.4.3. Has the member demonstrated the leadership and management skills required
     in the new career field?
     5.14.4.4. Has the member achieved the average TIS and TIG, both in the new career
     field and in the Air Force at large, to avoid creating an unfair promotion competition
     advantage over their new career field peers? NOTE: Members being assigned to a new
     career field will not retain any grade for which they do not meet the minimum Air Force
     TIS requirements in Table 2.1, or be given DOR earlier than possible under those TIS
     requirements.
 5.14.5. GPR Board Recommendations. The Promotion Propriety Review Board may make
 any of the following recommendations:
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                              53


      5.14.5.1. Allow the member to retain their current rank and time in grade.
      5.14.5.2. Allow the member to retain their current rank, but have their DOR adjusted in
      accordance with determinations made with respect to paragraph 5.14.4. NOTE: A
      member’s downward-adjusted DOR may extend to any period including present date of
      rank.
      5.14.5.3. Demote to a rank and DOR commensurate to members with similar TIS in the
      new career field or the Air Force at large. The DOR for the grade to which demoted may
      be either the average date of rank held by other Airmen in that grade in the new career
      field or the DOR actually held if previously promoted to the grade under other Air Force
      promotion systems. NOTE: A member cannot be demoted below a grade previously
      earned under the Air Force promotion system governing the gaining career field.
   5.14.6. GPR Resulting Administrative Actions. The respective command A1 or DP staff
   notifies the local MSS to publish any required demotion/DOR adjustment guidance for the
   gaining MPE, and HQ AFPC/DPSOE to project DOR.

                                         Chapter 6

                     ADMINISTRATIVE DEMOTION OF AIRMEN

6.1. Demotions. Don’t use administrative demotions when it is more appropriate to take actions
specified by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
   6.1.1. The home station unit commander is the demotion authority. Deployed commanders
   must send demotion actions to the home station unit commander for action. The home station
   unit commander will complete coordination with the appropriate demotion authority.
   6.1.2. Do not demote Airmen who have separated.
   6.1.3. Begin administrative demotion for action during the term of enlistment when the
   reason for the action occurred, except when the commander is not aware of the facts and
   circumstances until after that term of enlistment expires.
   6.1.4. If the commander has sufficient reason to initiate demotion action, use the entire
   military record in deciding whether demotion is appropriate.
   6.1.5. When appropriate, give Airmen an opportunity to overcome their deficiencies before
   demotion action is initiated. Commanders should maintain supporting documentation of all
   rehabilitation and probationary actions.
   6.1.6. Do not suspend administrative demotions. The demotion authority, with
   administrative jurisdiction, can restore the individual’s original grade. If the demotion
   authority restores the Airman’s original grade following the demotion, he or she must do so
   sometime between 3 months and 6 months after the effective date of the demotion.
       6.1.6.1. Restoring grade should be an uncommon occurrence. The effective date and the
       date of rank (DOR) are the date on which the demotion authority approves restoration in
       writing.
   6.1.7. Do not revoke demotion orders. File a source document such as AF Form 2096,
   Classification/On-The-Job Training Action, in the Airman’s ARMS record with the
   memorandum approving the restoration. Notify HQ AFPC/DPSOE by message of the
   restored grade per AFMAN 36-2622, Base Level Military Personnel System (formerly AFM
   30-130, Volume 1).
6.2. Who Can Demote.
   6.2.1. The group commander, or equivalent level commander, may demote MSgts and
   below. Equivalent level commander is defined as a senior Air Force officer in the grade of
   colonel. EXAMPLE: An Air Force officer in charge of an Air Force Element or a
   commander above the squadron level. NOTE: Higher levels of command may also demote,
   but group commander is the lowest level of authority.
   6.2.2. The major command (MAJCOM) commander, field operating agency (FOA)
   commander, or direct reporting unit (DRU) commander may demote those in the grades of
   SMSgt and CMSgt. This demotion authority may be delegated to the MAJCOM vice
   commander, Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Personnel, Numbered Air Force
   (NAF), or equivalent level commanders, but may not be further delegated.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                55


   6.2.3. The appellate authority is the next higher level commander and handles demotion
   appeals.
   6.2.4. The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) may demote to significantly reduce strength,
   grade levels, or both.
6.3. Reasons to Demote.
   6.3.1. Student Status Termination. Airmen are demoted to their former grade when their
   student status ends if they were promoted in anticipation of completing additional training, or
   to obtain a commission.
      6.3.1.1. Demote officer trainees or pipeline students to their former grade if they are
      eliminated from training.
      6.3.1.2. Delay the demotion when an Airman would lose authorization to ship household
      goods, move dependents, or both, until he or she arrives at the new duty location
      (permanent change of station [PCS]). The gaining commander completes demotion
      action using the effective date as the date when the Airman arrives at the new duty
      location.
      6.3.1.3. Demote Airmen attending temporary duty (TDY) Air Force schools to their
      former grade when the school commandant informs the base that their student status is
      terminated.
   6.3.2. If a member is promoted to SSgt, MSgt, or SMSgt with an approved EPME waiver
   and later is dismissed from PME for cause, demote the Airman to former grade.
   6.3.3. Demotion Based on Skill Levels. Demote Airmen, when appropriate, to a grade that
   corresponds to their skill level.
      6.3.3.1. Demote Airmen, including Airmen promoted with a Primary Air Force Specialty
      Code (PAFSC) waiver, if they cannot achieve a skill level appropriate to their grade.
      6.3.3.2. Demote Airmen to the highest possible grade allowed for the skills they have if
      their Air Force specialty (AFS) is downgraded for substandard performance. Use the date
      their skill level was reduced as the effective date of demotion.
   6.3.4. Failure to fulfill Responsibilities. Airmen may be demoted who don’t fulfill Airman,
   noncommissioned officer (NCO), or SNCO responsibilities under AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted
   Force Structure, Chapters 3 through 5.
   6.3.5. Failure to Keep Fit. Airmen may be demoted for failing to maintain or demonstrate
   the ability and willingness to attain physical standards, according to AFI 10-248, Fitness
       Program.
   6.3.6. Failure to Perform. Demote Airmen under the policies of HQ AFDW/A1P, and this
   instruction, if they do not perform at USAF or USAF Space Command bands standards
   (applies to AFSC 3N2X1).
   6.3.7. Voluntary Reassignment or Reclassification. Demote Airmen under the policies and
   procedures established by HQ AFDW/A1P if they volunteer for reassignment or
   reclassification out of AFSC 3N2X1.
6.4. How to Process a Demotion.
56                      AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


  6.4.1. The Unit Commander:
     6.4.1.1. Signs the notification memorandum informing the Airman of intent to demote.
     6.4.1.2. Cites this instruction, the specific paragraph, demotion authority if other than
     initiating commander, the recommended grade for demotion, the specific reasons for
     demotion, and provides a summary of the facts.
     6.4.1.3. Ensures the following information is included in the notification memorandum:
         6.4.1.3.1. ―I (concur)(do not concur) with the proposed demotion; I (will or have)
         (will not or have not) (submit or submitted) written materials on my behalf. I
         (request)(waive) a personal hearing before the initiating commander. I (have)(have
         not) consulted with counsel.‖
     6.4.1.4. Advises the Airman that he or she may seek legal counsel. The unit commander
     provides the name and number of the local Area Defense Counsel who can assist with
     written and oral statements.
     6.4.1.5. Informs the Airman (if eligible) of the right to apply for retirement in lieu of a
     demotion, effective no later than the 1st day of the 4th month following the initial
     notification of demotion, as follows:
         6.4.1.5.1. Within 3 working days of Airman’s acknowledgement of demotion
         memorandum, if eligible to retire, indicate the member understands the option to
         apply for retirement in lieu of demotion. Also indicate whether Airman is applying
         for retirement in lieu of demotion.
         6.4.1.5.2. Member must have completed at least 20 years of active duty service by
         the 1st day of the 4th month after the initial notification date of demotion.
         6.4.1.5.3. Member must apply within 3 working days, or the demotion will make
         effect as the date the demotion authority approved the demotion. See paragraph
         5.6 for additional instructions on applying for retirement in lieu of demotion.
     6.4.1.6. Makes sure the Airman endorses the demotion when he or she receives it. The
     Airman must agree or disagree within 3 working days.
     6.4.1.7. Informs the Airman that if he or she does not agree, statements may be
     presented, orally or written, within 3 work days after receiving this. The unit commander
     may approve extensions, in writing.
  6.4.2. The Initiating Commander. After receiving the Airman's acknowledgment, the
  commander decides whether or not to terminate the demotion action or continue processing
  it.
     6.4.2.1. If the commander terminates the demotion process, he or she needs only to
     inform the Airman.
     6.4.2.2. If the commander decides to continue processing the demotion action, he or she
     notifies the affected Airman of the decision in writing. The commander summarizes the
     written or oral statements, and sends the entire case file to the servicing MPS for
     processing.
AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                 57


   6.4.3. Demotion Authority. The demotion authority can take additional grade reductions
   other than the initiating commander's recommendation. Request a written legal review from
   the servicing staff judge advocate (SJA) before deciding the demotion. Return the entire case
   file to the Airman's servicing MPS.
   6.4.4. MPS. The MPS informs the Airman's unit commander, in writing, of the demotion
   decision and gets the Airman's written acknowledgment.
   6.4.5. The commander:
       6.4.5.1. Informs the Airman that his or her current grade is retained if the demotion is not
       approved.
       6.4.5.2. Informs the Airman of the grade to which he or she is demoted, including the
       DOR and the effective date.

       working days.
       6.4.5.4. Informs the Airman that he or she can appeal the demotion to the appellate
       authority within 3 working days.

6.5. How to Process an Appeal. The MPS forwards the case to the demotion authority for
review. The demotion authority can reverse the previous decision and restore the Airman’s
original grade, or forward the case to the appellate authority without comment. If the appellate
authority approves the appeal, the appellate authority directs the MPS to restore the Airman’s
previous grade and revoke demotion orders.
6.6. How to Apply for Retirement. An Airman eligible for voluntary retirement can elect to
―retire in lieu of demotion.‖ The effective date of retirement will be no later than the 1st day of
the 4th month following the date the Airman received the initial demotion notification.
   6.6.1. When an Airman submits an application in vMPF to retire in lieu of demotion, all
   demotion action stops until the authorities act on the retirement application.
   6.6.2. The demotion process terminates if the authorities approve the retirement application
   and continues if the application is disapproved.

 58                       AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010


   6.7.4. Demote by three or more grades only when no reasonable hope exists that the Airman
   will ever show the proficiency, leadership, or fitness that earned the initial promotion.
6.8. How to Determine the DOR.
   6.8.1. DOR for Airmen demoted under paragraph 6.3.1 is the first date served in reduced
   grade (i.e., original date of rank).
   6.8.2. DOR for Airmen demoted under paragraphs 6.3.3 through 6.3.7 is the effective date
   of the demotion action (i.e., the date the demotion authority approves the demotion).
   6.8.3. HQ AFDW/A1P determines the DOR for Airmen demoted under paragraphs 6.3.5
   and 6.3.6.
6.9. When to Announce and Revoke Demotions.
   6.9.1. Publishing Orders. The MPS publishes orders after the demotion authority (not the
   appellate authority) approves the demotion, but not earlier than 4 working days after the
   Airman acknowledges it. Forward one copy of each demotion order under this instruction to
   HQ AFPC/DPSOE.
   6.9.2. What To Do If the Airman Is Eligible to Retire in Lieu of Demotion. Publish orders
   only if the Airman does not submit an application for retirement within 3 working days
   following acknowledgment (not including the date of acknowledgment).
      6.9.2.1. Stop demotion proceedings for an Airman who applies for retirement pending
      the outcome of the application.
      6.9.2.2. If authority turns down the application for retirement in lieu of demotion,
      publish the demotion orders. The effective date and DOR of the demotion are the
      approval date of the demotion.
   6.9.3. Revoking Demotion Orders. Revoke demotion orders and restore the Airman’s grade
   if the demotion authority determines that the order was published without basis of authority.
6.10. How to Publish Demotion Orders. The special order series is ―AA‖ for administrative
demotions.
   6.10.1. The MPS:
      6.10.1.1. Gets written confirmation of verbal order as soon as possible.
      6.10.1.2. Publishes the administrative demotion special order. Include:
          6.10.1.2.1. Grade, name, SSN, unit, major command, and address of unit.

AFI36-2502_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 28 OCTOBER 2010                                            59


          permanent grade of SrA effective and with date of rank 15 August 1992. Authority:
          AFI 36-2502, paragraph 6.3. (Reference sub-paragraph referring to specific
          demotion reason).
          6.10.1.2.6. Why orders were not requested in advance. EXAMPLE: The verbal
          orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented written
          orders in advance.
       6.10.1.3. Distributes the demotion order to the individuals and organizations on the
       order.
       6.10.1.4. Forwards one copy of the demotion order to HQ AFPC/DPSSR, 550 C Street
       West, Suite 21, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4723 for the Military Personnel Records
       Group (MPerRGp).
6.11. The Demotion Authority:
   6.11.1. Directs revoked demotion orders published under this instruction if the appellate
   authority determines that demotion action is inappropriate.
   6.11.2. Retains demotion orders if the Airman’s grade is restored according to paragraph
   6.1.6. EXAMPLE: Paragraph 4.10. of Special Order AA-141, this HQ, 10 August 1992,
   purporting to demote SSGT EARL TRAVER, 123-45-6789, this HQ, to grade of SrA, which
   has been determined by Commander, AETC, to be without original basis and null and void,
   is revoked. Authority: AFI 36-2502, paragraph 5.3.__. (reference sub-paragraph referring to
   specific demotion reason).
6.12. Documenting Demotion Actions. The MPS:

   36-699, Volume 1, Military Personnel Flight (MPS) Management and Military Personnel
   Data System (MilPDS) User Guidelines, immediately after the demotion authority (not
   appellate authority) approves the demotion. EXCEPTION: The Airman applies for
   retirement in lieu of demotion.
   6.12.2. Sends a copy of the entire case file to HQ AFPC/DPSSRP, 550 C Street West Ste 21,
   Randolph AFB TX 78150-4723 to have documents scanned into ARMS (Automated Records
   Management System).
6.13. Dual Status Airmen. Airmen can also hold a commission as an officer in the Air Force
Reserves. If demoted, the MPS forwards the completed demotion report with the commander’s
recommendation regarding termination of appointment (AFI 36-3209, Separation and
Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members), directly to HQ
ARPC, Separations Branch (DPPS), 6760 East Irvington Place, Denver CO 80280-5000.

               STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING – PREMIER BANDS

1. Because my rank upon entry into [The United States Air Force Band or The United States Air
Force Academy Band] is governed by AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs, I
understand that if I no longer meet the performance standards of [The USAF Band or The
USAFA Band] or if I voluntarily request transfer from AFSC 3N2X1 (3N200), I will be
considered for administrative demotion or date of rank (DOR) adjustment.

2. If demoted, I may be demoted to the average grade held by other Airmen with similar time-in-
service (TIS) in the new AFSC, but not below an enlisted grade previously earned under regular
promotion programs. If demoted, my DOR in the grade to which demoted will be determined by
the recommendation of the Promotion Propriety Review Board with the concurrence of HQ
USAF/A1PPP.

3. I understand that I may not be permitted to retain any grade for which I do not meet the
minimum Air Force TIS requirements for consideration under general promotion programs.
These TIS requirements (contained in AFI 36-2502, Table 2.1) are Total Active Federal Military
Service of 1 year for SrA, 3 years for SSgt, 5 years for TSgt, 8 years for MSgt, 11 years for
SMSgt, and 14 years for CMSgt.

                          NOMINATION/SELECTION PROCESS


Units will consider all A1Cs identified by 366 FSS/FSMP as being eligible for promotion
consideration to SrA BTZ. 366 FSS/FSMP will provide unit commanders with a list of eligible
A1Cs and suspense for submitting packages for the Airmen being considered by the CBB.
Commanders may convene a unit nomination board. If so desired, the board should be
composed of at least three SNCOs. The board president will establish time and place for the
board to convene, and inform the unit commander of their nomination(s) to CBB. Board
members will evaluate each eligible Airman using the same criteria as the CBB. There is no
requirement for units to use the entire quota.
Boards will ensure fair and timely consideration of each nominee. Since the objective of the
BTZ program is to select only outstanding personnel for early advancement, the promotion board
is not obligated to select the full quota. Each nominee’s BTZ Nomination Fact Sheet is
evaluated for leadership and job performance in primary duties, significant self-improvement,
leadership qualities, and other accomplishments, and scored against the other nominees.
Selection is based on the "whole person" concept. Definitions of each category are identified on
the sample fact sheet (refer to Attachment 8).
Category points are awarded as follows:
Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duties: 0-60
Significant Self-Improvement: 0-20
Base or Community Involvement: 0-20
