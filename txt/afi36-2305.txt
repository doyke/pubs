3. Education Level Update Criteria:
     3.1. Accreditation. The system of regional and national accreditation recognizes educational
     institutions and professional programs affiliated with those institutions for a level of
     performance, integrity, and quality which entitles them to the confidence of the educational
     community and the public they serve. The Air Force recognizes schools with regional or
     national accreditation and candidacy for education level updates. Other schools require
     additional recognition as outlined in this AFI.
AFI36-2305 6 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                        5


       3.1.1. The Department of Education provides a directory of accredited programs and
       institutions at a website (http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.html). The
       Council on Higher Education Accreditation published website with accreditation
       information is http://www.chea.org/. The office accomplishing education level update
       uses one of these publications to verify accredited institutions and candidates for
       accreditation. Contact the appropriate accrediting body to verify additions to the guide
       since its last publication. Address any further questions concerning the accreditation
       status of institutions to AFIT/ACB.
       3.1.2. Universities, colleges, or training schools not meeting any of the criteria
       mentioned in 3.1., must submit request to the appropriate accrediting agency/association
       for inclusion in the Department of Education guides. It is the school’s responsibility to
       provide AFIT/ACB with necessary documentation to prove accreditation, candidacy, or
       federal degree granting authority.
       3.1.3. Non-accredited Institutions. Accept documentation for education level update only
       if the Airman pays for and obtains it from an accredited institution stating it will accept
       education credits from that school on the same basis as it would from accredited schools.
       3.1.4. International Institutions. Accept documentation for education level update of
       courses completed when the Airman obtains an external (commercial) evaluation of
       course work taken at foreign institutions. Foreign institutions that issue acceptable
       transcripts are listed in the Accredited Institutions of Postsecondary Education, published
       by the American Council on Education (ACE). Enter educational achievement obtained
       at international institutions in official records if properly evaluated. An accredited school
       (other than AFIT) or a private evaluation agency, such as the National Association of
       Credential Education Services (NACES), must accomplish the evaluation.
   3.2. Documentation. Official transcripts are required for new accessions. For degrees earned
   after accession, documentation may include official transcripts and/or official letter on
   institution letterhead stationery signed by the university registrar’s office and sent directly
   from the institution to AFIT or Education and Training Section (ETS) accomplishing the
   education level update. For a 90 day temporary update, the institution letter must include the
   student’s name, degree (or major area of study), degree or program level (i.e., certificate)
   number of hours completed or date of completion of degree requirements, date of
   graduation/degree award if different from degree completion requirements. AFIT may use
   the earlier date for education level update for graduation. The officer/airman will need to
   ensure an official degree posted transcript is provided to AFIT/ACB within the 90 day period
   to permanently update the record.‖
NOTE: Letters will not be accepted if they contain pending actions by the university to include
financial, academic or other audits.
       3.2.1. High School. Accept high school diploma from accredited institution or high
       school equivalency certificate. Certification of the General Educational Development
       Test, academic education level B, may be entered when the individual achieves a
       standard score of 35 on each test and an average standard score of 45 on all five parts.
       For prior service members enlisting in the Air Force Reserve, DD Form 214 is an
       acceptable source document for verifying high school completion.
 6                                                              AFI36-2305 6 FEBRUARY 2013


        3.2.2. Associate Degree. Accept official transcript from an accredited institution. For a
        CCAF degree an automated process updates the member’s education level based on
        CCAF credit hours recorded and graduation status. A CCAF degree progress report from
        the on-line system may be used to verify education levels E through H (Attachment 4).
        3.2.3. Less than Bachelor’s Degree. Accept education credit from accredited institutions
        as shown on an official transcript or other official documentation directly from the
        institution. NOTE: Degree levels below the bachelor level are not updated for AF officers
        unless specifically required, i.e., ANG Nurse Corps personnel. Technical/ Occupational
        certificates are not updated for AF officers.
        3.2.4. Bachelor’s Degree and above. Accept official transcript from an accredited
        institution or when the institution has federal degree-granting authority and is identified
        as offering the appropriate degree level (masters, doctorate, etc.)
        3.2.5. Certificate. Professional certificates are a designation earned by members to
        certify that they are qualified to perform a job. For example, a person with a degree in
        general education could qualify for an education specialty code in secondary teaching
        based on possession of a teaching certificate (Code 7 only). The MilPDS also will accept
        certain certificates for inclusion in an enlisted Airman’s military record.
4. Education Level Update Process:
     4.1. Officer Updates. Officers are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their education
     records annually. It is the officer’s responsibility to contact the issuing institution and fund
     the cost of any requested transcript/documentation (see paragraph 3.2.) for update and/or
     correction of military records. Transcript fees are not reimbursable by the Air Force.
     Transcripts/documentation must be mailed or sent electronically from the issuing institution
     directly to AFIT/ACB. NOTE: Transcripts issued to students will be accepted if they are in
     an originally sealed unopened envelope from the issuing institution or the ETS can verify the
     transcript as official, not maintained by student, and signs/dates copy of transcript with
     statement verifying its official nature in the ETS office.
        4.1.1. Initial Accession. AFIT/ACB will accomplish education level update into MilPDS
        and input source documents into OETR for audit purposes after receipt of official
        transcript as outline in Table A2.1 and details in paragraph 2.5.
        4.1.2. After Initial Entry and Initial Education Level Update. See paragraph 3.2.
        AFIT/ACB will accomplish education level update into MilPDS and input source
        documents into OETR after receipt of appropriate documentation.
        4.1.3. For AFIT-sponsored programs (Civilian Institution), AFIT/ACB updates the
        Airman’s record upon receipt of official transcripts and AFIT/ENEL (Civilian Institution)
        source document reflecting the academic specialty code (ASC) for which the Airman was
        sponsored to receive. Airmen requesting an ASC change must first obtain approval from
        AFIT/ENEL who will forward appropriate source document change to AFIT/ACB.
        4.1.4. For medical service officers attending AFIT-sponsored graduate programs, AFIT
        /ACB updates records of AFIT sponsored graduate students once the student has
        completed the graduate program and upon receipt of source documentation from
        AFIT/ENEL. HQ AFPC/DPAMD (for AFSC 47XX), DPAMN (for AFSC 46XX),
AFI36-2305 6 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      7


     DPAMP (for AFSCs 44XX, 45XX, and 48XX), DPAMS (for AFSC 41AX), DPAMW
     (for AFSCs 42XX and 43XX) must approve exceptions to this procedure.
     4.1.5. If an officer is meeting a promotion, assignment, or other selection board and
     official transcripts are not immediately available, AFIT will accept an official letter, on
     school letterhead stationery, signed by the university registrar verifying degree conferral.
     The letter must include the student's name, name of the board, name of degree/program,
     major area of study date of graduation. This update is for officers who have graduated
     from a university and official transcripts are not immediately available via electronic
     delivery means. NOTE: The respective boards establish final cutoff dates; consequently,
     inclusion of last minute updates in the consideration process cannot be ensured. Upon
     receipt of official letter, AFIT will update the record and notify the board indicated, if
     requested by the Airman. These updates are valid for a 90 day temporary update.
     Officers will need to ensure an official degree posted transcript is provided to AFIT/ACB
     within the 90 day period to permanently update the record. NOTE: Letters will not be
     accepted if they contain pending actions by the university to include financial, academic
     or other audits.
  4.2. Enlisted Updates. Enlisted Airmen are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their
  education records annually. It is the Airman’s responsibility to contact the issuing institution
  and fund the cost of any requested transcript/documentation for update and/or correction of
  military records. Transcript fees are not reimbursable by the Air Force.
  Transcripts/documentation must be mailed or sent electronically from the issuing institution
  directly to the base ETS. ETS will accomplish education level update into AFAEMS/MilPDS
  and input source documents into AFAEMS for audit purposes. NOTE: Transcripts issued to
  students will be accepted if they are in an originally sealed unopened envelope from the
  issuing institution or the ETS can verify the transcript as official, not maintained by student,
  and signs/dates copy of transcript with statement verifying its official nature in the ETS
  office.
     4.2.1. Initial Enlistment. DD Form 1966-2, with transcript attached, substantiates
     education data for those accessed into the Air Force. The 737 TRSS staff files the forms
     in the unit personnel records group. NOTE: For ARC members, official transcripts must
     be sent to the servicing Reserve military personnel flight/education and training function.
     4.2.2. After Initial Enlistment. The base ETS evaluates education achievements for
     enlisted personnel and updates records as described in para 4.2. The base ETS inputs data
     in MilPDS/AFAEMS.
     4.2.3. Senior Noncommissioned Officers (SNCO) (Master Sergeants and Senior Master
     Sergeants) Eligible for Promotion. If a senior NCO is meeting a promotion, or up for
     assignment, or other selection board and official transcripts are not immediately
     available, the base ETS will accept an official letter, on school letterhead stationery,
     signed by the institution’s registrar verifying education accomplishment. The letter must
     include the following information: student’s name, name of the board, name of
     degree/program, major area of study, number of hours completed or date of completion
     of degree requirements, and the date of graduation/degree award if different from degree
     completion requirements. The base ETS may use the earlier date of degree completion for
     education level update. The respective boards establish final cutoff dates for records
 8                                                             AFI36-2305 6 FEBRUARY 2013


        update; consequently, inclusion of last minute updates in the consideration process cannot
        be assured. Upon receipt of information on official letterhead, the ETS can notify the
        board indicated, if requested by Airman. These updates are valid for a 90 day temporary
        update. Officers will need to ensure an official degree posted transcript is provided to
        AFIT/ACB within the 90 day period to permanently update the record. NOTE: Letters
        will not be accepted if they contain pending actions by the university to include financial,
        academic, or other audits.
5. Education Classification and Codes. Education data entries in the MilPDS/AFAEMS
consist of three sets. One set is for coding academic education specialty (classification), another
for coding the education level, and a third for the method/resource used to obtain the education
level. Entries of letters X, Y, and Z in the education coding process indicate ―other‖, ―not
applicable‖, and ―unknown‖, respectively. The letters X and Y are most often entered in the last
two positions of the specialty code to identify no specialization or specialization in an area for
which no precise identifier exists. The letter Z in the education level high position will prompt
periodic output of an action-due notice at base level, instructing individuals to provide proof of
education accomplishment.
     5.1. Coding of Academic Specialty. Terms used to define an education specialty
     (classification) conform generally to civilian usage. The education specialties consist of a
     four-character alphanumeric code to identify (in order) general area of study, major
     education field, specialization, and subspecialization. Together they form an individual’s
     education specialty code. Review of the school’s catalog, discussions with the school, and
     student consultation may be necessary to determine education specialty (Attachment 3).
        5.1.1. General Area of Study. There are 10 groupings of education areas of study
        (Attachment 3). A person coded 4YYY, for example, would be identified as having, or
        working toward, a general engineering degree with no major education field,
        specialization, or subspecialization.
        5.1.2. Major. This character identifies a related specialization within the general area of
        study and consists of 18 or more semester hours. This term usually identifies the
        education degree title awarded by a college or university and is considered a person’s
        major. Building on the preceding example, a person coded 4AYY would be identified as
        having, or working toward, a degree in aeronautical engineering with no specialization or
        subspecialization.
        5.1.3. Specialization. Persons who have a concentration, reflected on the official
        transcript, in a particular education area may qualify for identification of specialization.
        Again building on the preceding example, 4AAY would identify a person with a degree
        in aeronautical engineering with specialization in aerodynamics. Specificity to this level
        is reserved for those who have completed advanced undergraduate or graduate work (a
        CCAF associate degree is an exception).
        5.1.4. Subspecialization. This character identifies a group of courses or on-the-job
        professional experience associated with a given specialization. Graduate study with
        specific research is an example of readily identifiable subspecialization.
        Subspecialization also may be identified on the basis of professional competency gained
        by experience on the job or documented self-initiated study. In the preceding 4AAY
        example, subspecialization in aerodynamic loads would be identified by the code 4AAA.

  5.2. Coding of Education Level.
     5.2.1. Each education level has a one alpha or numeric character code in MilPDS. (See
     attachment 4)
     5.2.2. Education Levels within MilPDS. The standard measures for determining
     education levels are semester hours and degrees. Quarter hours are converted to semester
     hours. One quarter hour equals two-thirds of one semester hour. MilPDS (HAF Table
     0228) and Attachment 2 of this instruction show the various education levels and
     corresponding codes.
         5.2.2.1. A maximum of five education levels may be assigned and coded for each
         officer and enlisted person.
         5.2.2.2. Two education levels are assigned to a person who presents official
         transcripts showing completion of at least 15 semester hours of graduate work beyond
         the bachelor’s degree.
         5.2.2.3. A person with two degrees at the same education level is coded first with the
         degree earned most recently.
         5.2.2.4. Individuals receiving dual majors will only be updated as having one degree
         level as they are considered one degree. In order to receive credit for both, the
         university will need to assign individual graduation dates for each major.
  5.3. Coding of Method/Resource Used to Obtain Education.
     5.3.1. This code is a one alpha or numeric character code to show major source of
     funding used to obtain a particular education level.
     5.3.2. Even though the MilPDS data field is labeled ―method‖ this code must reflect
     funding source before consideration of the program. The most common codes are T—
     tuition assistance, V—VA sponsorship, and Y—not sponsored by the military. Examples
     of funding as primary method is the choice of ―T‖ for Tuition Assistance (TA) Program
     or ―J‖ for Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) if TA is not used for CCAF
     degree. (See PDS, HAF Table 0102 and Attachment 5 of this instruction).
