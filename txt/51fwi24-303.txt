This instruction implements AFPD 24-3, Management, Operation and Use of Transportation
Vehicles, and complements AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management. It establishes policies and
procedures for implementing and managing the wing’s vehicle accident and abuse program. It
includes specific guidance and addresses the definitions, authority, disposition, reporting
procedures, and reimbursement of funds for repairs of military vehicle abuse and accidents. It
applies to all units that operate government owned or leased vehicles managed by the 51st
Fighter Wing (51 FW). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through Major Command (MAJCOM)
publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed
in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It supersedes
51FWI 23-102, 2 April 2010. Updates include adding the classification of a vehicle incident
(paragraph 6.4) and including the authorization for units to front load funds for accident/abuse
repairs (paragraph 7.3.1).
1. Goal. To reduce mishaps, this in turn, will reduce the risk of personal injury or death and
reduce the cost of vehicle accidents and abuse repairs.
 2                                                        51FWI24-303 27 NOVEMBER 2012


2. Objective. To establish an effective mishap prevention program by placing responsibility
and charging the operator and the operator's commander with maintaining high standards of
vehicle operator training and discipline. Consequently, when using procedures set forth in
paragraph 7 of this instruction, units will pay for the actual cost of materials and labor (except
Korean national employee civilian labor costs) used to repair accident and abuse damage caused
to vehicles operated by their personnel. This policy will help foster better operator care and
condition of Osan’s vehicle fleet.
3. Responsibilities. In some cases, the using organization may not necessarily be the owning
organization, i.e., a U-Drive-It (UDI) vehicle from the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) or a
loaned vehicle from another organization. Reimbursement for repairs resulting from accidents or
abuse will be made regardless of determinations of individual liability resulting from a Report of
Survey. All vehicle management Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds expended for
vehicle accident and abuse repair costs, including contract cost, will be reimbursed to vehicle
management by the owning organization, or the organization responsible for the damage, if not
the owner. In cases where multiple Government-Owned Vehicles (GOV) are involved and an
investigation cannot determine fault, repair costs will be the responsibility of the
organization/squadron to which the operator is assigned.
4. Key Personnel/Organization Duties.
     4.1. The 51 LRS/CC will:
        4.1.1. Provide accident or abuse estimate and notification memorandum or electronic
        notification (Attachment 3) and photos to the using organization’s squadron commander.
        This responsibility can be delegated to the Vehicle Fleet Manager or Vehicle
        Management Flight Commander by the 51 LRS/CC.
        4.1.2. Send an accident/abuse notification memorandum to the following: 51 FW/SE, 51
        CPTS/FM and 51 FW/JA.
           4.1.2.1. Direct accident/abuse repair within 3 days after accident/abuse notification,
           if using organization commander does not indicate to 51 LRS/LGRV a Report of
           Survey investigation has been or will be initiated.
        4.1.3. Not provide UDI replacements to organizations with vehicles involved in
        accidents or identified as abuse, unless it will impede "installation security, force
        protection", sortie generation or sustainment.
        4.1.4. Not authorize accident or abuse repairs until responsible organization commanders
        acknowledge they will reimburse LRS for the cost of the repair or 3 days after the
        responsible organization commander is notified of the accident or abuse.
     4.2. The 51 LRS/LGRV Vehicle Fleet Manager or Vehicle Management Superintendent
     (VFM/VMS) will:
        4.2.1. Identify suspected accidents and abuses.     Evaluate and validate each alleged
        vehicle accident and abuse case.
        4.2.2. Consider the facts and determine whether the vehicle should be processed as an
        accident or suspected abuse, due to damages not attributed to fair wear and tear
        (unreported accidents are treated as vehicle abuse).
51FWI24-303 27 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   3


   4.3. Vehicle Management and Analysis Section (VM&A) will:
      4.3.1. Document and track vehicle accident and abuse repairs.
      4.3.2. Provide an AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement, when it has
      been determined that liability is to be assessed or voluntary payment is to be made, as a
      result of a Report of Survey (ROS).
   4.4. Using organization commander will:
      4.4.1. When deemed appropriate, appoint an investigating officer to conduct a
      preliminary investigation IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force
      Property, Chapter 18.
      4.4.2. Ensure the investigation is completed and processed IAW AFMAN 23-220,
      Chapter 18.
   4.5. Assigned or using organization will:
      4.5.1. Reimburse the 51 LRS for all vehicle parts and/or contract repair costs of vehicles
      damaged by personnel assigned to their organization. Turn vehicles into Vehicle
      Management immediately after being released from the accident scene, if it can be driven
      safely. If the vehicle cannot be delivered to Vehicle Management immediately following
      an accident, it must be reported via telephone (DSN 784-3059 / 4310) within 24 hours.
      The initial responsibility to identify and report accidents rests with the vehicle operator
      and the using organization.
   4.6. Vehicle Control Officer (VCO) / Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Officer will:
      4.6.1. Maintain an accident/abuse case file containing at least, but not limited to, the
      following: SF 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report (not applicable for abuse), copy of
      investigation, accident/abuse notification memorandum. This file will be maintained
      IAW AF RIMS. These files will be inspected as part of the annual VCO program
      assessment.
   4.7. The 51 MSG/CC will:
      4.7.1. Resolve all conflicts concerning the vehicle accident and abuse program and serve
      as the final decision authority. If an organization commander determines the government
      owned vehicle or equipment accident/abuse case is not justified, written justification must
      be forwarded to the 51 LRS/CC. If the 51 LRS/CC agrees, the abuse case will be
      dropped. If the 51 LRS/CC does not agree, the 51 MSG/CC becomes the arbitrary
      authority.
5. Additional Guidance.
   5.1. Accidents involving Privately Owned Vehicles (POV) and Government Owned
   Vehicles/Equipment (GOV/E): The assigned or using organization will provide the 51
   FW/JA with sufficient information about the accident to determine if the POV or GOV driver
   was at fault. If the POV was at fault, the 51 FW/JA will pursue repairs through the POV
   insurance company, with all repairs being accomplished through contractors to facilitate
   reimbursement of costs.
 4                                                          51FWI24-303 27 NOVEMBER 2012


     5.2. Multiple-Unit Accidents: Each unit will conduct an investigation. The commanders of
     the units involved will jointly determine liability. If a decision cannot be made the 51
     MSG/CC will have final decision authority.
     5.3. Pecuniary Liability: For GOVs, reimbursement to the 51 LRS for repairs due to
     accidents or abuse will be made regardless of individual pecuniary liability as assessed
     through a Report of Survey.
6. Definitions.
     6.1. Accident: Any situation where a government owned or leased vehicle/equipment strikes
     or is struck under conditions indicating that the situation occurred due to the negligence or
     unintentional act of a vehicle operator.
     6.2. Abuse: A willful or negligent act of improper operation or care, or an omission that has
     caused damage that cannot be attributed to fair wear and tear under normal circumstances.
     Vehicle abuses may result in early failure of components or immediately detectable damage.
     Some examples of vehicle abuse are listed in Attachment 2.
     6.3. Fair wear and tear: The normal expected deterioration of a vehicle or equipment based
     on its age, usage, and life expectancy.
     6.4. Incidents are classified as damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters, mechanical
     failures or other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided by safe operation or
     adequate vehicle care during non-use. The VFM/VMS is the fleet management functional
     expert with the authority to determine what is/is not classified as an incident. Using
     organizations are not required to reimburse for damage caused by incidents. Note: Wind
     damage to vehicle doors is not an act of nature.
7. Procedures. Upon determination of vehicle damage, as a result of an accident or abuse:
     7.1. Vehicle Management will initiate a work order to estimate repair costs. The notification
     will include details of the accident or abuse damage, photos of damage, copy of the work
     order or contractor estimate, AF Form 1800 Operators Inspection Guide and Trouble Report,
     SF 91 (if applicable), contract estimate (if applicable), and will be sent by the 51 LRS/CC or
     delegated appointee to the responsible organization's commander (see Attachment 3). Note:
     The 51 LRS/LGRV will make all payments for Defense Working Capital Fund reimbursable
     to the organization’s registered Air Force vehicles.
     7.2. As determined by the VFM/VMS, accident and abuse repairs estimated below the GPC
     micro-purchase threshold of $3,000 will generally be completed utilizing contracted
     maintenance. In-shop repairs will be accomplished at the discretion of the VFM/VMS in
     order to minimize the backlog of maintenance repairs for mission critical assets. Vehicle
     Management will source vendors to complete repairs, track repairs with contract work orders
     and make GPC payment when repairs are complete.
     7.3. By releasing the government-owned vehicles for repair, the using organization
     commander is accepting financial liability and will reprogram funds to the 51 LRS to the
     nearest hundredth dollar for reimbursement. (Example: If the bill is $3,549 reimbursement
     equals $3,500. If it is $3,551 reimbursement equals $3,600).
        7.3.1. When LRS funds are not available to initiate vehicle accident and abuse repairs,
        using organizations have the option to front-load these funds to LRS. Unit RAs must
51FWI24-303 27 NOVEMBER 2012                                                             5


     coordinate these transactions with the LRS RA. Vehicle Management can only initiate
     repairs when funds are available. In some cases, when accident/abuse repairs are
     contracted, unit RAs may be able to make their own GPC payment upon repair
     completion. In these cases, Vehicle Management will make arrangements to inspect the
     vehicle for quality control before payment is made.
     7.3.2. For those organizations not in the same Budget Authorization and/or Program
     Element Code, and are not part of the normal reimbursement program, the using
     organizations responsible for accident/abuse damage will provide an OF 1017-G, Journal
     Voucher, to the 51 LRS/RA for the amount of the accident/abuse cost. The exact cost of
     repairs is computed using an AF Form 20, in accordance with AFMAN 23-220.
     7.3.3. After all repairs are completed, the 51 LRS/LGRV will submit a copy of the AF
     Form 20 to the 51 LRS Resource Advisor, who in turn will forward to the 51 CPTS/FMA
     along with a target load/change/delete form for reprogramming of funds.
