This publication provides guidance on a base-wide response to respiratory related illnesses to include
influenza (flu) and pandemic influenza (PI). It may also serve as guidance for other communicable respi-
ratory diseases such as mumps and pertussis. It is consistent with the Department of Defense (DoD) Pan-
demic Preparation and Response Health Policy by the Assistant Secretary of Defense. In an effort to
adequately inform the base populace on the appropriate measures to be taken, this instruction will outline
those precautions and actions to take. The concept of a flu condition (FLUCON) will also be introduced.
Each FLUCON level will be determined by the installation commander after receiving recommendations
from the 460th Medical Group Public Health Emergency Officer (460 MDG/PHEO). This instruction
applies to all Department of Defense employees, Air Force and civilian personnel assigned, attached or
associated with the 460th Space Wing to include Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Center per-
sonnel. Modifications to the FLUCON actions may be made as needed. See Attachment 1 for glossary of
references and supporting information. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication

1. Overview.
   1.1. Influenza is a viral respiratory disease that affects humans and certain animal species. Clinical
   manifestations range from a mild, nonspecific illness with fever, cough, or sore throat to life-threaten-
   ing respiratory distress and even death. Most new strains typically break out at various times across
   the world in a well-established pattern originating in Asia along a slow regional migration. Annual
   vaccinations administered to the military and civilian populations are based on strains that have been
   documented and isolated from previous outbreaks. A unique strain of influenza commonly called
   avian influenza (H5N1) or bird flu is currently circulating around the bird population across Asia and
   now into Europe, usually found in migratory fowl or domestic poultry. The cause for greatest concern
   is the virus’ potential to mutate into a virus with human-to-human communicability.
   1.2. Although H5N1 certainly is a looming threat, other respiratory illnesses including the standard
   influenza A and B are more likely to hit the base population each year. As a result, it is imperative that
   the base be ready to respond not only to PI but also to a strain that may not be covered by that year’s
   vaccine due to a more dramatic antigenic drift from the time of the vaccine’s production. Of note, a
   vaccine for PI is not expected to be developed and released until 3 to 6 months into the worldwide
   spread of disease. As a result, references to vaccine in this document are simply for the standard influ-
   enza immunizations that are typically given in the fall of each year.
   1.3. The FLUCON system has been designed to establish this base’s posture from one level to the
   next based on the virulence and clinical manifestations of a respiratory illness, disease surveillance
   and detection, and basic operational risk management. (See Attachment 2 for FLUCON and World
   Health Organization (WHO) phase explanations)

        4.5.4. Maintain supplies IAW with current guidelines. (Attachment 4)

5. Summary. Public Health emergencies, i.e. pandemic illnesses, can dramatically impair mission effec-
tiveness and success rates. Education of all personnel is critical to preventing the spread of disease. Com-
manders must provide for constant monitoring of the health of their assigned personnel. The importance
of hand washing, adherence to social standards during increased threats, and taking care of each other
cannot be overemphasized. Cleaning contact areas such as countertops and door handles are important
measures in preventing the spread of infection. Aircraft that have had collisions with birds in areas where
Avian Influenza is suspected must also be cleaned and disinfected appropriately in accordance with Air
Force guidance (Attachment 10). Limiting the impact of a disease pandemic must be an integral part of
the on-going mission for our base population.

Address each item with caller. Once covered, check off.

Treatment of influenza:
____ Drink plenty of fluids
____ Eat small quantities of food (often)
____ Consider using a humidifier while sleeping (if one is available)
____ Take medications as directed (medications will be provided to you)
____ Avoid using alcohol and tobacco

To avoid spreading influenza to someone else:
____ Wash your hands frequently, scrubbing all of hands (e.g., between fingers, under fingernails) with
soap for at least 30 seconds and repeating, then use a paper towel to open the door out of a public
restroom, especially after sneezing or coughing and before touching other
people or items other people might touch - germs can stay alive on surfaces for almost a day
____ Cough and sneeze into a disposable tissue (not a handkerchief) and discard immediately
after one use
____ Don't share drinking containers and eating utensils
____ Avoid public places for prolonged periods, e.g., work, chow hall, Rec tent, Gyms, etc. while you're
contagious
____ Use alcohol based sanitizers

ORAL REHYDRATION INSTRUCTIONS (if required)

1. Sports Drinks.

       a. Sports drinks may be indicated for mild dehydration.

        b. The carbohydrate content should not exceed 15% prior to dilution. Sports drinks should be
diluted to half strength (1 part water: 1 part beverage or 2 parts water: 1 part beverage powder) for optimal
fluid replacement.

        c. The half-strength sports drink should be kept cool (60-70° F) or shaded if possible. The bever-
age must be discarded after 8 hours if refrigerated, or within 4 hours if allowed to warm. Sports drinks
should not be added directly to canteens or bulk water storage (i.e., water buffaloes or tanks); they should
be added to personal drinking cups or larger washable containers for group access. Wash and sanitize
re-usable containers at the end of each work shift, as the sugar content can provide a good growth medium
for bacteria. Unless in powder form, refrigerate undiluted portions of open sports drink containers.

2. Oral Re-hydration Powder.

       a. Powder may be reconstituted with potable water.

       b. Treat reconstituted re-hydration drink like the sports drink above.

   A6.1.1. Operational Antiviral Ground Testing Form is a two-part form. Both parts need to be com-
   pleted and signed for the patient to be certified to fly. Contact 460 MDG/SGMP for copies of the
   Ground Testing Operation Antiviral_460 MDG Overprint_106.
       A6.1.1.1. Part 1 records all pertinent information pertaining to an aircrew member prior to com-
       mencement of Operational Antiviral ground testing. It acts as a checklist and must be completed
       prior to the issue of the antiviral. Focused history should center on current medications and any
       diseases of illnesses that would preclude a safe or valid ground test.
           A6.1.1.1.1. Controllers and aircrew will not control/fly and will be suspended from Personal
           Reliability Program status (if applicable) for 12 hours following ingestion of these medica-
           tions.
           A6.1.1.1.2. Controllers and aircrew should be advised to return on the next duty day, or sooner
           if unusual symptoms are experienced.
   A6.1.2. Part 2 Documents the results of ground testing of Operational Antivirals and must be com-
   pleted following each ground test. Authorized medication and dosage should be noted and the patient
   cleared to fly for that specific medication and dosage (e.g. oseltamavir 75 mg) provided no adverse or
   operationally significant side effects occur. Contact 460 MDG/SGMP for copies of the Ground Test-
   ing Operation Antiviral_460 MDG Overprint_107.
   A6.1.3. Flight Surgeons should specifically question personnel on any occurrence of dizziness, nau-
   sea, or vomiting while taking oseltamavir.
   A6.1.4. If the aircrew member experiences any significant adverse effects during operational antibi-
   otic ground testing, an FDA Form 3500 – MedWatch should be completed and forwarded as directed.
   A copy of this form should also be forwarded to MAJCOM SG.
   A6.1.5. Each form should only be used for one medication and dosage (e.g. oseltamavir 75 mg). If
   new dosages or medications are to be tested, a new operational antiviral ground testing form should be
   completed.
   A6.1.6. In addition to Parts 1 and 2 of the operational antiviral ground testing form, the following
   forms must also be completed prior to final authorization of Operational Antiviral usage, and before
   the individual is returned to flying duties following ground testing:

WHO GUIDELINES FOR THE COLLECTION OF HUMAN SPECIMENS FOR LABORATORY
                     DIAGNOSIS OF AVIAN INFLUENZA

A7.1. General Information. Respiratory virus diagnosis depends on the collection of high-quality spec-
imens, their rapid transport to the laboratory and appropriate storage before laboratory testing. Virus is
best detected in specimens containing infected cells and secretions. Specimens for the direct detection of
viral antigens or nucleic acids and virus isolation in cell cultures should be taken preferably during the
first 3 days after onset of clinical symptoms.

A7.2. Type of Specimens. A variety of specimens are suitable for the diagnosis of virus infections of the
upper respiratory tract:

Nasal swab
Nasopharyngeal swab
Nasopharyngeal aspirate
Nasal wash
Throat swab

     A7.2.1. In addition to swabs from the upper respiratory tract, invasive procedures can be performed
     for the diagnosis of virus infections of the lower respiratory tract where clinically indicated:

     Transtracheal aspirate
     Bronchoalveolar lavage
     Lung biopsy
     Post-mortem lung or tracheal tissue

     A7.2.2. Specimens for the laboratory diagnosis of avian influenza A should be collected in the fol-
     lowing order of priority:

     Nasopharyngeal aspirate
     Acute serum
     Convalescent serum

     A7.2.3. Specimens for direct detection of viral antigens by immunofluorescence staining of infected
     cells should be refrigerated and processed within 1–2 hours. Specimens for use with commercial
     near-patient tests should be stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Specimens for
     virus isolation should be refrigerated immediately after collection and inoculated into susceptible cell

   cultures as soon as possible. If specimens cannot be processed within 48–72 hours, they should be
   kept frozen at or below –70° C.
   A7.2.4. Respiratory specimens should be collected and transported in virus transport media. A num-
   ber of media that are satisfactory for the recovery of a wide variety of viruses are commercially avail-
   able.

A7.3. Procedures for Specimen Collection.
   A7.3.1. Materials required.

   Sputum and mucus trap
   Polyester fibre-tipped applicator
   Plastic vials
   Tongue depressor
   15-ml conical centrifuge tubes
   Specimen collection cup or Petri dishes
   Transfer pipettes

   A7.3.2. Virus transport medium.
       A7.3.2.1. Virus transportation medium for use in collecting throat and nasal swabs.
           A7.3.2.1.1. Add 10 g veal infusion broth and 2 g bovine albumin fraction V to sterile distilled
           water (to 400 ml).
           A7.3.2.1.2. Add 0.8 ml gentamicin sulfate solution (50 mg/ml) and 3.2 ml amphotericin B
           (250 µg/ml) Sterilize by filtration.
       A7.3.2.2. Nasal wash medium. Sterile saline (0.85% NaCl).

A7.4. Preparing to Collect Specimens.
   A7.4.1. Clinical specimens should be collected as described below and added to transport medium.
   Nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs can be combined in the same vial of virus transport medium. When
   possible, the following information should be recorded on a form that lists general patient informa-
   tion, type of specimens, date of collection, and contact information of person completing the form,
   etc.
   A7.4.2. Standard precautions should always be followed, and barrier protections applied whenever
   samples are obtained from patients.
       A7.4.2.1. Nasal swab. A dry polyester swab is inserted into the nostril, parallel to the palate, and
       left in place for a few seconds. It is then slowly withdrawn with a rotating motion. Specimens from
       both nostrils are obtained with the same swab. The tip of the swab is put into a plastic vial contain-
       ing 2–3 ml of virus transport medium and the applicator stick is broken off.
28                                                                          460SWI48-7 13 MARCH 2007


        A7.4.2.2. Nasopharyngeal swab. A flexible, fine-shafted polyester swab is inserted into the nostril
        and back to the nasopharynx and left in place for a few seconds. It is then slowly withdrawn with
        a rotating motion. A second swab should be used for the second nostril. The tip of the swab is put
        into a vial containing 2–3 ml of virus transport medium and the shaft cut.
        A7.4.2.3. Nasopharyngeal aspirate. Nasopharyngeal secretions are aspirated through a catheter
        connected to a mucus trap and fitted to a vacuum source. The catheter is inserted into the nostril
        parallel to the palate. The vacuum is applied and the catheter is slowly withdrawn with a rotating
        motion. Mucus from the other nostril is collected with the same catheter in a similar manner. After
        mucus has been collected from both nostrils, the catheter is flushed with 3 ml of transport medium.
        A7.4.2.4. Nasal wash. The patient sits in a comfortable position with the head slightly tilted back-
        ward and is advised to keep the pharynx closed by saying "K" while the washing fluid (usually
        physiological saline) is applied to the nostril. With a transfer pipette, 1–1.5 ml of washing fluid is
        instilled into one nostril at a time. The patient then tilts the head forward and lets the washing fluid
        flow into a specimen cup or a Petri dish. The process is repeated with alternate nostrils until a total
        of 10–15 ml of washing fluid has been used. Dilute approximately 3 ml of washing fluid 1:2 in
        transport medium.
        A7.4.2.5. Throat swab. Both tonsils and the posterior pharynx are swabbed vigorously, and the
        swab is placed in transport medium as described above.

A7.5. Sera Collection for Influenza Diagnosis.
     A7.5.1. An acute-phase serum specimen (3–5 ml of whole blood) should be taken soon after onset of
     clinical symptoms and not later than 7 days after onset. A convalescent-phase serum specimen should
     be collected 14 days after the onset of symptoms. Where patients are near death, a second ante-mor-
     tem specimen should be collected.
     A7.5.2. Although single serum specimens may not provide conclusive evidence in support of an indi-
     vidual diagnosis, when taken more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms they can be useful for
     detecting antibodies against avian influenza viruses in a neutralization test.

GUIDANCE FOR CLEANING AIRCRAFT EXTERIOR AFTER COLLISIONS WITH BIRDS IN
           AREAS WHERE AVIAN INFLUENZA A (H5N1) IS OCCURING

A10.1. Airplanes occasionally collide with birds in the air or during take-off or landing resulting in visi-
ble residue that must be cleaned from the exterior of the plane after landing. In areas where H5N1 infec-
tions are occurring in bird populations such a collision might occur with an infected bird, posing a
theoretical risk of contaminating the exterior surface of the plane with blood, feces or other contaminated
material (such as feathers). Influenza viruses are unlikely to survive the low humidity and low oxygen
environment encountered during flight, but following standard cleaning recommendations (http://
www.iata.org/whatwedo/health_safety/aviation_communicable_diseases.htm) and precautions for
handling dead poultry in H5N1-affected areas (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/outbreaks/embargo.htm)
may reduce any potential risk.

A10.2. The following recommendations are prudent measures to reduce potential exposure to H5N1 and
are based on professional judgment, routes of transmission, and perceived level of risk. Because migra-
tory birds could spread H5N1 to new areas prior to lab detection and reporting, these precautions should
be considered any time bird products are cleaned from the exterior of an aircraft:
   A10.2.1. Wear non-sterile disposable gloves and, depending on the quantity of bird-related material
   needing to be cleaned, consider protective eyewear (goggles) (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/
   eye-infectious.html) and a surgical mask while cleaning. A surgical mask and goggles will help
   reduce potential exposure to large particulate that could be spattered during cleaning or handling of
   bird-related materials.
   A10.2.2. Place any bird carcasses or parts removed during cleaning in a bag or container and inciner-
   ate; do not dispose of in the trash.
   A10.2.3. Use an agent equivalent to household cleaner or detergent to clean the surface and allow to
   air dry in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
   A10.2.4. Keep hands away from mouth and face until washed thoroughly. A mask and goggles will
   reduce the potential for accidental contact between the hands and face.
   A10.2.5. Avoid washing surfaces with pressurized water or cleaner (i.e., pressure washing). Pressure
   washing could theoretically aerosolize H5N1 viral particles that could then be inhaled, even if wear-
   ing a surgical mask.
   A10.2.6. Remove and discard gloves and wash hands after cleaning is done. Avoid touching your face
   with gloved or unwashed hands. Do not remove goggles or surgical mask until after gloves have been
   removed and hands have been washed.
   A10.2.7. Remove eye protection and place in a designated receptacle for subsequent cleaning and dis-
   infection. Remove and discard surgical mask as contaminated material.
   A10.2.8. Clean hands with soap and water a second time (or an alcohol-based hand gel when soap and
   water are not available) immediately after personal protective equipment is removed.
