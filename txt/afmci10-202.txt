      PCS/PCA, separation, or retirement.
4.4. Weapons and Ammunition Requirements. One weapon will be available for each
manpower requirement reflected in deployable force packages. The supported Combatant
Commander makes the decision to deploy with or without weapons, and this information will be
passed to each unit via deployment order or deployment equipment guidance.
      4.4.1. If weapons are required, each individual assigned to a position is issued an M-16 rifle
      upon deployment. Couriers are issued M-9 pistols in addition to an M-16 due to individual
      weapons requirements at deployed location.
      4.4.2. Team chiefs may be issued and carry an M-9 pistol at the Group/Squadron
      Commander's discretion.

                     NON-CONTINGENCY UTILIZATION POLICY

6.1. General. ABDR Forces work with the ALC production organizations and weapon system
support managers, or equivalent counterparts, in support of ALC workloads. The use of ABDR
personnel in depot work centers provides valuable working experience, which contributes to
their increased expertise in aircraft maintenance. Every effort must be made to ensure support
provides ABDR personnel with quality training versus an emphasis on manpower augmentation.
   6.1.1. ABDR personnel shall only be tasked with workloads that enhance training,
   proficiency of core task, or contingency/wartime capability.
   6.1.2. ABDR personnel will participate in the Wing/Group detail program. Long-term
   details will be minimized due to the unpredictable nature of ABDR deployments.
   6.1.3. ABDR personnel will not replace any existing or future civilian manpower
   authorizations or supervisory positions. Nothing in this instruction will be interpreted to
   preclude the combining of military and civilian personnel to perform mission tasks.
   6.1.4. ABDR personnel will be organized into DFTs that provide technical assistance or
   perform specified maintenance and modification tasks on aircraft or aerospace equipment.
   Team sizes and personnel skills are determined on a case-by-case basis to support TO 00-25-
   107 and AMXG-generated workload requests.
6.2. AMXG Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. Ensure ABDR personnel are utilized as an integral part of the production workforce
   for on- and off-base workloads, as long as the work is in support of primary training for
   wartime skills; i.e., weapon system hands-on experience.
       6.2.1.1. ABDR wartime mission readiness requirements will take priority over
       production workload requirements and details. Be prepared to assume workload being
       performed by ABDR personnel when a higher priority (contingency) tasking is received.
       This workload may include, but is not limited to, DFTs, ABDR, or a home station
       tasking.
       6.2.1.2. ABDR personnel detailed to production areas must be assigned duties that
       commensurate with their grade and skill level.
   6.2.2. Ensure ABDR unit is given full consideration for TO 00-25-107 requests. Use the
   ABDR unit to the maximum extent, commensurate with available skills for off-base
   workloads, with special emphasis on the value of Temporary Duty (TDY) for enhancement
   of their mission.
   6.2.3. Provide training, funding, equipment, facilities, tools, and supplies to upgrade and
   enhance the skills of ABDR personnel in support of their mission.

                        TOOL AND MATERIAL TRAILERS AND KITS

7.1. General. ABDR tool and material trailers, tool kits, and PMEL/assessor kits are an integral
part of the ABDR mission. Tool and material trailers are deployed as separate UTCs while tool
kits and PMEL/assessor kits will be deployed as on-hand equipment and supplies.
7.2. ABDR Tool and Material Trailers.
      7.2.1. ABDR tool and material trailers are designed as generic assets to support multiple
      weapon systems, with the exception of the F-22 trailers, which are weapon system specific.
      7.2.2. Trailers for each force package supporting contingency/wartime operations will be
      pre-positioned in the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and United States Air Forces in Europe
      (USAFE) theaters as WRM. Trailers will be stored inside at the bases of intended use in the
      PACAF theater and at USAFE’s central WRM storage facility for the USAFE and U.S. Air
      Forces Central (USAFCENT) theaters.
      7.2.3. Tool and material quantities will match the approved core trailer requirements as
      listed in the UTC Logistics Detail (LOGDET). The ABDR TSO will maintain status of and
      develop upgrade requirements for future additions, as well as identify items for deletion.
      Submit recommended changes to the ABDR TSO for approval and update to the LOGDET.
      7.2.4. Inspect WRM trailers annually to include the following:
      7.2.4.1.   All WRM trailer external areas, trailer and housing, will be managed and
      maintained by WRM contract maintenance/Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) personnel.
             7.2.4.1.1. Use TO 36A11-18-22-1, Operation and Maintenance Instruction with IPB,

             munitions trailer configuration.
             7.2.4.1.3. Trailers are not required to submit to the Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI)
             requirements.
         7.2.4.2. All WRM trailer internal contents, tools, and material will be inspected,
         managed, and maintained by the ABDR TSO. All tools will be vacuum-sealed for long-
         term storage.
             7.2.4.2.1. Accomplish 100% tool and material inventory on 25% of trailers; ensuring
             100% tool accountability every 4 years.
             7.2.4.2.2. Tools without plating (c-clamps, screw drivers, cutting tools), to include all
             air driven tools, will be inspected, oiled, and operationally checked annually.
AFMCI10-202 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  23


          7.2.4.2.3. Any drawer barrier paper that is opened for inspection, or found to have a
          loss of vacuum, will be resealed using new sealing material. Using tape to cover torn
          or punctured sealing material is not an acceptable repair.
      7.2.4.3. The ABDR TSO will maintain a WRM trailer inspection tracking method to
      show completion of each inspection, dates, drawers inspected, findings, and corrective
      actions.
   7.2.5. Training trailers will be inspected annually by the user in addition to normal tool
   control and accountability procedures. Inspection and maintenance requirements can be
   accomplished by other maintenance activities (e.g., AGE) if an agreement is established.
   7.2.6. Each ABDR unit is responsible to budget for the maintenance and reconstitution of
   training trailers assigned at their location.
   7.2.7. Reconstitution of WRM trailers used for contingencies will be accomplished using
   guidance provided for that particular operation, and typically involves reimbursement using
   an Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code. If specific guidance is not provided for an
   operation, HQ AFMC/A4DE will pursue and execute funding received for reconstitution of
   the WRM ABDR tool and material trailers.
7.3. ABDR Tool and PMEL/Assessor Kits.
   7.3.1. ABDR personnel will maintain one CTK for each maintenance technician and
   assessor, excluding team chiefs, for deployments. Kits will move with teams when they
   deploy. Kits are SORTS reportable.
      7.3.1.1. ABDR CTKs will match, as a minimum, requirements approved by the ABDR
      TSO. Each ABDR unit will maintain master inventory lists for the kits maintained and
      forward applicable copies to the TSO as changes occur. Submit recommended changes
      to the TSO for approval. The TSO, in-turn, will notify the applicable ABDR units to
      update the affected master inventory list.
   7.3.2. Unit personnel will maintain two each PMEL/assessor kits for each ABDR team. Kits
   will match, as a minimum, the requirements outlined in TO 1-1H-39, Table 11-1, and will
   deploy with teams as required. Kits are not SORTS reportable.
7.4. Tool Control.
   7.4.1. Training trailers, CTKs, and PMEL/assessor kits will meet tool control requirements
   in accordance with AFI 21-101 AFMCSUP 1.

                                             Chapter 8

                                     TRAINING AIRCRAFT

8.1. General.
      8.1.1. This instruction represents minimum requirements for maintaining ABDR training
      aircraft. ABDR training aircraft will not be used for purposes other than ABDR or related
      maintenance weapons load, crash recovery, or fire rescue training without approval of HQ
      AFMC/A4DE through the ABDR TSO.
      8.1.2. Each unit should possess weapon systems trainers, which are specific to the UTCs
      assigned at their units. In addition to weapons system specific aircraft, each unit is
      encouraged to acquire other aircraft to expand their knowledge and increase the experience
      of working on non-UTC tasked aircraft. Where problems exist in the non-availability of
      airframes for ABDR training, units will work through the ABDR TSO to obtain removable
      aircraft components in order to meet training requirements.
      8.1.3. The management of ABDR training aircraft is assigned to the ABDR TSO.
8.2. ABDR TSO Responsibilities.
      8.2.1. Maintain a database of all assigned training aircraft, and maintain all necessary
      documentation to manage the program.
      8.2.2. Manage cannibalization requests.
      8.2.3. Coordinate with AF/A8PL to acquire replacement training aircraft.
      8.2.4. Screen aircraft through General Services Administration (GSA) in accordance with
      DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, prior to releasing aircraft for turn in
      to Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO).
8.3. Unit Responsibilities.
      8.3.1. Upon receipt of training aircraft, the gaining organization will accomplish, to the
      maximum extent possible, save list actions using an item recovery list provided by the
      weapon specific SPO. Only those items that will not impact system integrity and are not
      needed for ABDR training will be removed. As a minimum, this requires the removal of all
      explosive or propellant actuated items, weapons, classified items, survival equipment,
      hazardous systems or materials, and Air Force critical items. All remaining items may be
      retained for ABDR training.
         8.3.1.1. Removed items will be processed through base supply according to appropriate
         supply and security instructions.
         8.3.1.2. Units will develop a local checklist by weapon system to ensure all explosive
         and propellant items are removed, document compliance with SPO-directed save list, and
         document compliance with paragraph 8.3.4.
         8.3.1.3. Forward completed checklist to the ABDR TSO.
      8.3.2. ABDR training aircraft are coded for test and evaluation use. Parts contained on these
      aircraft are to be considered unsatisfactory and will not be cannibalized for use on
AFMCI10-202 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   25


  operational aircraft. If a shortage of a particular component is identified, the ABDR TSO, in
  conjunction with the applicable weapon system program office and HQ AFMC/A4DE, will
  determine if parts can be removed from ABDR training aircraft.
  8.3.3. Approval authority for removing parts from ABDR training aircraft is HQ
  AFMC/A4DE through the ABDR TSO. Request will be conducted as follows:
     8.3.3.1. The unit requesting the part will originate the request in memorandum format.
     The memorandum will be addressed to the EDMX Flight Superintendent, and will
     include at a minimum, the Model/Design/Series (MDS), aircraft serial number, part
     nomenclature, part number, stock number, TO figure number, and index.
     8.3.3.2. The EDMX Flight Superintendent will then forward the cannibalization request
     memorandum, along with a memorandum stating approval or disapproval of the request,
     to the ABDR TSO. A memorandum of approval must state ―the removal of the part or
     parts will not affect ABDR training or the safety of the aircraft‖.
  8.3.3.3. The ABDR TSO will then review the two memorandums and provide approval or
  disapproval to the requesting unit and the EDMX Flight Superintendent. HQ AFMC/A4DE
  will have final approval authority.
  8.3.4. The unit will ensure that ABDR training aircraft or training components (where
  applicable) are:
     8.3.4.1. Drained, de-puddled, and purged of fuel per TO 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of
     Aircraft Integral Tanks and Fuel Cells. A write-up will be placed in the AFTO Form
     781-series stating the current fuel configuration.
     8.3.4.2. The unit may remove the fuel cell instead of purging them. If cells are removed,
     all components must be reinstalled in the cavity areas so power may be applied to the
     aircraft.
     8.3.4.3. Maintained in a satisfactory condition so safety standards are not violated.
     8.3.4.4. All safety precautions such as grounding, safety pins, and locks will be installed
     per applicable TOs.
     8.3.4.5. Aircraft or components are not required to be kept in a flyable condition and are
     exempt from recurring inspections and Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs).
     8.3.4.6. Electrical and hydraulic systems are maintained so that power can be applied and
     essential system repairs can be operationally checked, as long as economically feasible.
     8.3.4.7. Aircraft tires will be poly-filled the moment it is economically feasible. Once
     completed, tire pressure checks are no longer required during maintenance procedures;
     however, visual inspections will be required per AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight
     Line – Ground Operations and Activities.
     8.3.4.8. Ensure gun systems are removed.
     8.3.4.9. Ensure all egress explosive system items are removed.
     8.3.4.10. Ensure liquid oxygen and gaseous oxygen converters and storage tanks are
     removed.
26                                                             AFMCI10-202 30 AUGUST 2011


     8.3.5. Maintain applicable TOs necessary for basic system servicing and general
     maintenance systems upkeep.
        8.3.5.1. Obtain TOs from the losing organization when possible. If applicable TOs are
        no longer available from the losing organization, they should be requested through the
        normal TO distribution system.
        8.3.5.2. TOs will be maintained and marked for ―TRAINING USE ONLY‖ per
        procedures contained in TO 00-5-1.
        8.3.5.3. If movement of an aircraft into a hangar is required, local procedures will be
        developed in accordance with AFOSHSTD 91-100.
        8.3.5.4. If towing of aircraft is required and all TO requirements cannot be met, detailed
        local procedures will be prepared and coordinated with installation ground safety, fire
        department, and chief of quality assurance.
     8.3.6. General and applicable weapon system -39 TOs will be maintained.
     8.3.7. AFTO Forms 97- and 781-series will be maintained for each assigned ABDR training
     aircraft or component. These forms will be used to provide status of system serviceability,
     maintenance, parts removed, and to document ABDR training actions that are accomplished.
     The forms review process, as outlined in AFI 21-101, is not required; however, local
     procedures will be created to meet the intent.
     8.3.8. The unit may use explosives to inflict simulated battle damage to training aircraft as
     this provides the most realistic-type damage. Procedures for inflicting explosive damage are
     contained in TO 1-1H-39. Units will use information on actual battle damages (when
     available) from SURVIAC databases to inflict damages on aircraft in an attempt to gain the
     most realistic scenarios possible.
     8.3.9. The unit will ensure that all explosives safety requirements are complied with prior to
     inflicting simulated battle damage in accordance with AFMAN 91-201.
     8.3.10. The unit will measure the lower explosive limit, per applicable TO, of all fuel tanks
     or cells immediately prior to inflicting any explosive damage.
     8.3.11. To extend the training life of aircraft, explosive charges must be carefully placed to
     prevent damaging non-ABDR repairable, major structural parts, and system components.
        8.3.11.1. Items within the direct line of fire such as actuators, electronics, line
        replaceable units, control boxes, etc., will be removed or protected prior to inflicting
        simulated battle damage with explosive devices.
     8.3.12. After damage has been inflicted, the above units will be reinstalled prior to
     assessment and repair of damage.
     8.3.13. Aircraft components damaged beyond a unit’s battle damage repair capability will
     not be ordered. If a component is unserviceable, it will be by-passed, disconnected, or
     removed to allow continued limited system operation.
     8.3.14. When training aircraft is no longer considered satisfactory for ABDR training, the
     EDMX Flight Superintendant will provide a memorandum to the ABDR TSO requesting
     approval for disposal.
AFMCI10-202 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                     27


     8.3.14.1. The request will contain the MDS, serial number, and reason for disposition.
     8.3.14.2. Once approved, disposal will be coordinated through the local DRMO.
     8.3.14.3. The aircraft will be demilitarized according to DoD 4160.21-M, and DoD
     4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual, prior to disposal.
     8.3.14.4. Once disposal occurs, the unit will forward all documentation signed by the
     local DRMO to the ABDR TSO so that records can be annotated.
  8.3.15. The EDMX Flight Superintendent will ensure ABDR training aircraft requirements
  are submitted as part of their fiscal year program and budgeting projections. Include costs to
  maintain existing aircraft, and costs associated with replacing or acquiring new aircraft (i.e.,
  transportation, travel, per diem, and disposal costs).

Terms
Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR)—The capability to quickly assess and restore a
damaged aircraft to a useful level of combat capability within a tactically reasonable time period
with the resources reasonably available in theater. These repairs may be temporary or permanent
in nature, and may restore full or partial capability. ABDR capability may be used to allow
extensively damaged aircraft to make a one-time flight to its home station, rear base, or major
repair facility.
Composite Tool Kit (CTK)—A controlled area or container used to store tools or equipment,
and maintain order, positive control, and ease of inventory. CTKs are assembled as a kit, and are
designed to provide quick, easy visual inventory and accountability of all tools and equipment.
CTKs may be in the form of a toolbox, a shadow board, shelves, system of drawers (Stanley
Vidmar, Lista, etc.), cabinets, or other similar areas or containers. The CTK contains tools and
equipment necessary to accomplish maintenance tasks, troubleshooting, and repair.
Cross Utilization Training (CUT)—Qualifies personnel to perform duties outside their AFSC,
and should be used to help local managers meet mission requirements. Normally, CUT
programs should be limited to those airmen who are fully qualified in their primary AFSC.
ABDR Forces—AFMC active duty forces of specially trained personnel who provide peacetime
or wartime technical assessment and repair of damaged aircraft. It consists primarily of the
ABDR unit and the ALCs’ tasked aircraft engineers. If required, it can include civilian and/or
contractor resources to meet specific requirements.
Designed Operational Capability (DOC)—A summary of the unit’s mission and resources for
which it has been organized, designed, and equipped.
Exercise—A military maneuver, or simulated wartime operation, involving planning,
preparation, and execution. It is carried out for the purpose of training and evaluation. It may be
a combined, joint, or single service exercise, depending on the participating organizations.
Functional Manager—The OPR for a particular Air Force unit, function, or specialty.
 34                                                          AFMCI10-202 30 AUGUST 2011


OPLANs—An operation plan for the conduct of joint operations. An OPLAN identifies the
forces and supplies required to execute the strategic concept and movement schedule of the
resources to the theater of operations.
Readiness—The ability of forces, units, weapons, or equipment to deliver the output for which
they were designated. This includes the ability to deploy without unacceptable delays. It
includes the totality of proficiency and sufficiency in forces, units, air bases, weapons systems,
and equipment; prepared or available for service or action.
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS)—The system used to report the status of a
unit’s resources and training measured against that required to undertake the mission for which
the unit was organized or designed.
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A five character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each force
package.
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)—Provides Air Force Commanders with the current
policies and planning factors for conducting and supporting wartime operations. It establishes
requirements for developing mobilization and planning programs to support sustained
contingency operations of the programmed forces.
Weapon Familiarization Training—Conducted by personnel within the unit, and as a
minimum, consists of familiarization with weapon safety, loading and clearing procedures,
clearing barrel procedures, disassembly and assembly, function check, care and cleaning, and
visual inspection. The objective is to ensure all weapons-qualified personnel can handle
weapons responsibly at home station and in a deployed environment. This training is in addition
to weapons qualification training provided by Combat Arms Training and Maintenance.
