SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates Interim Change 2009-1, which establishes credit for events performed
in the Mi-17 aircraft (paragraph 5.2.4.1.5 (Added)). A star (*) indicates changes to the previous
version.
1.1. Process waivers for the basic AFI through stan/eval channels to HQ AETC/A2/3/10. Waiver
authority for this supplement is HQ AETC/A3F unless otherwise stated. Waivers to unit-level
supplemental guidance will be handled by the operations group (OG) or training group (TRG)
commander (CC) of the unit generating the supplement.
1.2.2.3.3. Units may supplement this supplement to document the process by which they
implement the requirements of the basic and this supplement. However, the supplemental
information may not duplicate or be less restrictive than the higher headquarters information.
Forward unit supplements through stan/eval channels to HQ AETC/A3FV for review before
publication. HQ AETC/A3Z is the approval authority. Forward one copy each of the published
supplement to 19 AF/A3S and HQ AETC/A3FV.
1.2.3.2.1. Syllabus waivers and syllabus deviations will be processed and approved according to
the applicable syllabus guidance.
1.2.3.2.2. For nonexistent formal school courseware applicable to only one unit, the unit training
officer will develop local courseware to forward to 19 AF/A3 for approval. For any events listed
as requiring “MAJCOM or Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF) approved courseware,” the 19 AF/A3
will be the approval authority for unit-developed training programs.
1.2.3.3. Forward training shortfall reports through 19 AF/A3 to HQ AETC/A3F.
1.6. A qualified and certified instructor flight engineer will conduct duty familiarization training
for medical technicians.
1.8.2. 19 AF crewmembers will be trained to the appropriate status as determined by the 19
AF/A3. All others below the 19 AF level will be trained to the appropriate status as determined
by the OG (TRG)/CC to which the individual is assigned and/or attached for flying.
1.8.3. Individuals will be trained to the appropriate status as determined by the OG (TRG)/CC to
which the individual is attached for flying. An individual must meet or exceed all initial and
recurring training requirements for the unit to which he or she is attached.
1.9. Acceptance of aircrew mission qualifications and/or certifications is the decision of the OG
(TRG)/CC.
1.10. 1. (Added) Qualified UH-1N crewmembers from other MAJCOMs may perform basic
crew duties on AETC UH-1N aircraft with the OG (TRG)/CC’s approval.
1.10.2. (Added) Qualified UH-1N instructor crewmembers from the 336th Training Group (336
TRG) or other MAJCOMs may perform formal school instruction at the 58th Special Operations
Wing (58 SOW) only on a case-by-case basis. The 58 SOW OG/CC must ensure each instructor
possesses the qualifications and/or certifications required for the maneuvers or sorties to be
flown. Additionally, the instructor will complete a duty familiarization sortie, a briefing on
common student errors, and an observation sortie with a 58 SOW instructor in a like crew
position instructing a student. The duty familiarization sortie and student observation sortie may
be combined at the discretion of the 58 SOW OG/CC.

the applicable syllabus or AETC guidance.
3.2. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/AETC Sup, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, is the
source reference for certification of AETC aircrew members to flight examiner status.
3.5.2. Send notification of training in excess of 120 days through 19 AF/A3 to HQ AETC/A3F.
3.5.5. NVG training is normally conducted at the formal school. Training will consist of
academic and practical use of current night vision devices. As a minimum, the course will
include eye physiology, illumination, night vision device components and performance factors,
testing procedures, and mission planning factors. Crewmembers approved for in-unit initial
mission qualification training with no prior NVG qualification are required to attend a night
vision device lab prior to entering the NVG phase of flight training. The OG (TRG)/CC will not
waive the requirement to have 50 hours of NVG time prior to performing in-flight instruction.”
4.1. H-1 personnel transferring to the Air Force from other services and USAF pilots returning
