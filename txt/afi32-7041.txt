                                                 Chapter 2

    WASTEWATER AND STORM WATER COLLECTION, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL
                            COMPLIANCE

2.1. Water Quality Compliance Program. A water quality compliance program must be established at
all Air Force installations to assess, attain, and sustain compliance with applicable Federal, state and local
water quality regulations and permits. All references to NPDES permits in this AFI include wastewater
permits issued by Federal, state and local regulatory agencies. For overseas installations, all references to
“NPDES permits” refer to wastewater discharge permits issued by recognized HN local governments or
authorities in accordance with standards set by the FGS, or if no FGS exists, the OEBGD. See Attach-
ment 2 for brief descriptions of the applicable Federal regulations.

2.2. NPDES Permits. For overseas installations, water quality-like permits may be found under the
OEBGD (Chapter 4), FGS (Chapter 4), and/or HN operating permit.
   2.2.1. Installations must comply with all NPDES permit requirements. Failure to comply may result
   in legal enforcement actions.*
   2.2.2. Storm Water Discharges.
       2.2.2.1. Industrial activities. Unless exempted, coverage under an NPDES permit is required for
       discharge of storm water associated with industrial activities into waters of the United States.
       Storm water discharges associated with industrial activities are listed in Title 40, Code of Federal
       Regulations (CFR), section 122.26(b)(14).*
           2.2.2.1.1. For stateside locations, NPDES storm water discharge permittees must develop and
           implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) within Federal and state regula-
           tory time limits (40 CFR 122.26 and 123.25). For overseas locations, the FGS or OEBGD also
           require the development and implementation of a SWPPP. Develop and implement Best Man-
           agement Practices (BMPs) to eliminate and reduce pollutants. Pursue non-structural BMPs
           before considering structural BMPs. Ensure BMPs are achievable and cost effective. The
           BMPs and other requirements written into the SWPPP are enforceable.
           2.2.2.1.2. Each regulated installation shall establish a cross-functional Storm Water Pollution
           Prevention Program team to develop and implement storm water management programs that
           effectively reduce or prevent the discharge of pollutants into receiving waters and manage the
           installation’s Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program. The SWPPP team should include, at
           a minimum, CE, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), JA, and Public Affairs (PA). Based on
           installation-specific needs, additional organizations that have an impact on storm water should
           also be included in the SWPPP team.*
           2.2.2.1.3. The SWPPP must identify potential sources of pollutants in runoff from industrial
           activities that could affect the quality of storm water that an installation discharges.
           2.2.2.1.4. Permittees shall perform and document annual storm water site compliance evalua-
           tions.
       2.2.2.2. Regulated Construction Activities. Construction activities disturbing one (1) or more
       acres in aggregate require a completed SWPPP and the timely submission of a Notice of Intent
       (NOI). The project manager should review the construction activities to determine whether
8                                                                    AFI32-7041 10 DECEMBER 2003


       exemptions to submitting an NOI are available. Attention should be given to permitting author-
       ity-specific requirements such as: parties required to submit a NOI, signatory authority, keeping a
       copy of the plan on-site, and statutory waiting period after submission of the NOI before construc-
       tion can begin. For overseas locations, coordinate with your construction agent to comply with
       any FGS requirements.
           2.2.2.2.1. Upon final stabilization of construction site, permittee shall submit a Notice of Ter-
           mination (NOT) to the permitting agency.*
       2.2.2.3. Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4). Installations are automatically
       regulated as Small MS4s if they are located within an Urbanized Area (UA), designated by the
       Bureau of the Census. Installations should consult with JA to determine whether the installation is
       required to comply with MS4 requirements. Under some conditions, the regulatory agency may
       designate installations not located in a UA for MS4 permit coverage.*
           2.2.2.3.1. Regulated small MS4s must submit an NOI and a 5-year storm water management
           plan (SWMP) to obtain coverage under a small MS4 NPDES storm water permit. The SWMPs
           must address minimum control measures, along with measurable goals, as stated in the current
           EPA Phase II Rule (64 Federal Register (FR) 68722, December 8, 1999) or applicable state or
           local MS4 permit requirements. The development, implementation and management of the
           SWMP are the responsibility of the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Team (See paragraph
           2.2.2.1.2.).
           2.2.2.3.2. Regulated installations must submit an annual program status report to the appropri-
           ate regulatory agency, as stated in the current EPA Phase II Rule or applicable state or local
           MS4 permit requirements.
    2.2.3. Wastewater Discharges.
       2.2.3.1. Discharges from Federally Owned Treatment Works (FOTWs). Wastewater point source
       discharges into waters of the U.S. require NPDES permits. Permitted discharges must comply
       with wastewater permit conditions, including sampling, analysis, record keeping, and timely sub-
       mission of Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMR) to the regulatory authority. Overseas wastewater
       treatment plants (WWTP) under U.S. control must follow local wastewater discharge permit
       requirements, if issued, or applicable FGS or OEBGD discharge standards.
       2.2.3.2. Discharges to Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) and HN Treatment Facilities.
       Installations that discharge to permitted POTWs are considered as secondary dischargers and are
       regulated by the POTW authority. They must comply with applicable POTW regulations, permits,
       and contractual agreements. Overseas installations discharging to local or regional treatment
       plants must comply with applicable standards in the FGS or OEBGD.
       2.2.3.3. Permits. When first applying for or renewing a permit, installations will review the draft
       permit requirements proposed by the regulatory agency to ensure they are reasonable and achiev-
       able. If conditions in a draft permit could be amended to better suit Air Force needs, or are unac-
       ceptable or unachievable, negotiate these issues in close coordination between installation JA and
       CE. Overseas locations coordinate with your MAJCOM for consultation with the DoD EEA.
       2.2.3.4. Water Treatment Residuals Disposal. A NPDES permit must cover direct discharges from
       swimming pool filter backwash water and water treatment residuals, including sludge and process
       wastewater from drinking water treatment plants, into waters of the United States.*
AFI32-7041 10 DECEMBER 2003                                                                              9


   2.2.4. Report water quality enforcement actions in accordance with AFI 32-7047. Resolve all NPDES
   or HN permit violations within the regulatory agency’s time frame. Maintain records of written corre-
   spondence and oral communication with the regulators in accordance with AFI 32-7047. Develop a
   management action plan, coordinate it with the regulatory agency, and resolve outstanding deficien-
   cies in a timely manner.

2.3. Federal Facility Compliance Agreements (FFCA).*
   2.3.1. The installation JA will negotiate realistic interim discharge standards and an achievable sched-
   ule for short-term corrective measures and long-term compliance, in close coordination with CE.
   2.3.2. An executed FFCA does not eliminate current noncompliance; it only temporarily allows dis-
   charges to exceed certain permit conditions.
   2.3.3. Failure to comply with FFCAs may lead to additional enforcement actions.

2.4. Air Force Owned and Operated Domestic Wastewater Treatment Systems.
   2.4.1. Plan, program, and execute routine operations and maintenance through the installations Sus-
   tainment, Repair and Modernization (SRM) program to prevent failure and noncompliance of waste-
   water systems.
   2.4.2. Installations should develop pretreatment standards, if required, for wastewater discharges to
   satisfy pretreatment requirements. See 40 CFR 403 through 471.
   2.4.3. Projects to upgrade, modify or replace wastewater systems must obtain applicable construction,
   wetlands, and NPDES permits. Required permits must be obtained from appropriate regulatory agen-
   cies prior to commencing construction and before starting plant operations.
       2.4.3.1. Installations should consider performing an Operations, Maintenance, Training, and
       Assistance Program (OMTAP) engineering analysis before programming wastewater system
       upgrades. For further detail on the OMTAP, see AFCESA A-GRAM 0-25, OMTAP Program for
       Drinking Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants, October 2001.
       2.4.3.2. Projects to upgrade, modify or replace wastewater plants must include on-the-job opera-
       tor training and development of new or revised operations and maintenance manuals.
   2.4.4. Wastewater treatment plant and collection system operators must be certified in accordance
   with state and local requirements (see AFI 32-1067, Water Systems). Overseas requirements are spec-
   ified by applicable FGS or OEBGD requirements.
   2.4.5. Connect to a regional wastewater treatment system if connection costs will not be more than 25
   percent above the life-cycle cost of the alternatives.

2.5. Wastewater Lift Stations. Lift stations must continue to operate during power failures and have
redundant pumps to provide adequate pumping capacity for handling the maximum wastewater flow
when one pump is out of service.
   2.5.1. Major lift stations require two independent power sources at each station such as standby or
   portable power generators. Provide standby power in accordance with Military Handbook
   (MIL-HDBK) 1005/16, Wastewater Treatment System Design Augmenting Handbook, 31 October
10                                                                      AFI32-7041 10 DECEMBER 2003


     1997, which refers to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering Instructions (EI) 11C201, Waste-
     water Collection and Pumping, 1 March 1997, Chapter 9-7, titled “Standby Power.”
     2.5.2. For lift stations located in low lying areas, or in areas remote from a treatment plant, provide
     standby power connection point capability to prevent flooding of lift station, overflows at sewer man-
     holes, backup of wastes into buildings, or any unauthorized discharges of untreated wastewater.
     2.5.3. For lift stations located at or in conjunction with treatment facilities, such as those required for
     influent pumping, recycling or bypassing of flows, and pumping of effluent, provide standby power
     capability if the pumping is essential to critical treatment processes, plant flow control, or is necessary
     to maintain compliance with the discharge permit.
     2.5.4. Lift stations must have audible and visual alarms at each pump station to alert maintenance
     staff of pump failures. Include equipment to transmit alarm signals to a central monitoring point, if
     possible. Install backup batteries or other emergency power sources to retain alarm data during power
     failures.
     2.5.5. Repair or replace failed pumps expeditiously to maintain redundancy.

2.6. Prohibition of Bypasses. Federal and some FGS regulations prohibit piped connections, overflow
devices and intentional bypasses that directly discharge untreated wastewater into waters of the United
States or the host nation, except under limited circumstances (see 40 CFR 122.41(m)(4) and (m)(2)).
Wastewater collection systems and pumping stations must not bypass nor allow overflow into storm sew-
ers or surface water. Notify regulatory authorities of an overflow event within 24 hours of discovery or in
accordance with local, state, or other reporting requirements (see AFI 10-2501). For overseas locations,
comply with applicable FGS or OEBGD requirements.
     2.6.1. Unpermitted combined sewer overflows are prohibited and shall be eliminated. Air Force
     installations must program to eliminate combined sewer systems.

2.7. Cross-Connections and Illicit Discharges. Discharges of non-storm waters into storm sewer sys-
tems are prohibited under the general storm water discharge permit, except under specific circumstances.
Eliminate cross-connections between wastewater and storm sewer systems and illicit connections of floor
drains and oil/water separators to the storm sewer system to prevent prohibited discharges.

2.8. Inflow/Infiltration. Minimize infiltration and inflow to wastewater collection systems.

2.9. Industrial Wastewater. Strictly control the discharge of industrial wastewater and other prohibited
waste from entering into domestic wastewater or other non-industrial sewer systems and storm sewer sys-
tems. Minimize or eliminate industrial wastewater generation through implementation of BMPs and pol-
lution prevention principles.
     2.9.1. Unauthorized discharges of certain types of industrial wastewaters through drains to domestic
     wastewater collection systems are prohibited. For discharges to POTWs, contact the facility manager
     for clarification.
     2.9.2. Flammable or explosive materials or wastes shall not be discharged into domestic wastewater
     collection systems.
     2.9.3. Pretreat regulated industrial wastewater to acceptable levels before discharge to a domestic
     wastewater or other non-industrial sewer systems. Pretreat other industrial wastewater, such as toxic,
AFI32-7041 10 DECEMBER 2003                                                                             11


   flammable, and corrosive wastes to remove these characteristics before discharge into a domestic
   wastewater system. See 40 CFR 403, General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources
   of Pollution. For overseas installations, comply with applicable FGS or OEBGD requirements. Pre-
   treat regulated industrial wastewater discharges to FOTWs or HN wastewater systems per applicable
   permit requirements.
   2.9.4. Collect and manage industrial wastewater as a hazardous waste per AFI 32-7042, Solid and
   Hazardous Waste Compliance, if regulations prohibit discharging such wastewater into domestic
   wastewater or other non-industrial sewer systems and pretreatment is not practical.

   2.10.1. Do not install any new OWSs until all alternatives have been evaluated (see Multiservice Oil/
   Water Separator Guidance Document, SFIM-AEC-EQ-CR-200010).
   2.10.2. Perform an OWS survey to locate all existing OWSs, evaluate their necessity, and identify
   opportunities to consolidate or eliminate OWSs. Implement pollution prevention principles and use
   BMPs to minimize the requirement for OWSs.
   2.10.3. Eliminate unauthorized waste discharges. Plug floor drains, where feasible, to eliminate
   potential illicit discharge points. Do not intentionally discharge or dispose of fuel, oil, grease, oily
   waste, solvents, cleaning compounds, corrosion-control facility waste, or other contaminants into
   OWSs. An OWS shall not be used as a containment device.
   2.10.4. New in-ground separators, including associated oil recovery tanks, must be installed over a
   double liner or have double walls and be equipped with a leak detection system. Separate oil recovery
   tanks may be regulated as underground storage tanks and must comply with applicable local, state,
   and federal underground storage tank regulations. Note also that some states regulate oil water separa-
   tors.
   2.10.5. Perform regular scheduled inspections and maintenance of all OWSs.
   2.10.6. Obtain an appropriate NPDES or HN wastewater discharge permit if a non-storm water dis-
   charge from an OWS to a wastewater treatment plant is not possible.

2.11. Aircraft Maintenance. Many routine aircraft maintenance operations produce hazardous wastes
classified as such under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (see AFI 32-7042, Solid and Haz-
ardous Waste Compliance). For overseas installations, comply with FGS or OEBGD criteria for Solid
Waste (Chapter 7) and Hazardous Waste (Chapter 6). Minimize the generation of hazardous wastes
through pollution prevention techniques. Either:
   2.11.1. Pretreat wastewater from these operations before discharging them to wastewater treatment
   plants according to Federal, state, and local pretreatment requirements (see paragraph 2.9.3.), or
   2.11.2. Manage these substances as hazardous waste (see AFI 32-7042).

2.12. Spill Plans (see 40 CFR 112.3). Implement SPCC plan requirements including release reporting
according to AFI 10-2501 and AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Programs. Develop and implement
Facility Response Plans (FRP), if required. Overseas installations, also comply with FGS or OEBGD cri-
teria for overseas spill compliance (Chapter 18).

tion. This paragraph describes the major components of the Clean Water Act. Pertinent Clean Water Act
requirements include: (1) Section 301 of the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1311),
which prohibits discharging pollutants into the waters of the United States; (2) The National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System, section 402 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1342) which requires per-
mits to discharge point source wastewater and storm water; and (3) The Clean Water Act requirements for
discharges into publicly owned treatment works, disposal of sewage sludge, construction in wetlands
areas, and control of pollution from non-point sources.
     A2.1.1. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Program. National Pollut-
     ant Discharge Elimination System permitting controls point source discharges, including storm water
     (see 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 122).

A2.5. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4715.5. DoDI 4715.5, Management of Environmen-
tal Compliance at Overseas Installations, establishes the framework for the overseas environmental
“laws” that all permanent U.S. overseas installations must comply with. The OEBGD provides the mini-
mum environmental compliance standards for DoD installations overseas where there are no published
nation specific FGS. FGSs use the OEBGD as a baseline that is further modified by incorporation of more
protective host nation standards as determined to be applicable and appropriate in accordance with inter-
national agreements (e.g., Status of Forces Agreement).
