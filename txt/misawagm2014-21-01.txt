with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force
publications; the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms

Misawa AB Publications and Forms Managers have the authority to send requests to Air Force
Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO) to request an extension of overdue Misawa AB publications and
forms. This memorandum will be included in the record set to justify this extension.

accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW
