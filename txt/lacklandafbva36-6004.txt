DON’T ASSUME.




       1 out of 5 females, 1 out of 8 males. Sexual assault affects us
  all. Don’t assume it won’t happen to you or to someone you know.
  Sexual assault survivors need our support, not our ignorance.


                      Support the survivor.
                                                        We can help.
         If you have been sexually assaulted, please call our confidential hotline at 671-SARC.
