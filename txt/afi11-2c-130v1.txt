                                           GENERAL

1.1. Training Objective. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training
United States Air Force Combat Delivery C-130H crewmembers according to AFI 11-202v1,
Aircrew Training.
     1.1.1. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop and maintain a
     high state of mission readiness for the immediate and effective employment in exercises,
     peacekeeping operations, contingencies, and war in any environment. Mission readiness and
     effective employment are achieved through the development and mastery of core
     competencies for C-130H crewmembers. These core competencies include tactical ingress,
     tactical egress, airdrop, formation, assault landings, NVG operations during all phases of
     flight, instrument procedures, mission planning, landing zone (LZ) ground operations, crew
     management, and C4/AOC integration. This AFI is a basic directive. Each MAJCOM or
     operational theater may supplement this AFI IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
     Management. MAJCOM supplements may be more, but not less restrictive than this
     instruction. MAJCOMs may set training requirements lower than specified in this instruction
     when the statement ―or as specified in MAJCOM supplement‖ is indicated as applicable to
     that item or event. MAJCOM supplements will be coordinated through AMC/A3T and
     approved by HQ AF/A3O-AT before publication. Air National Guard (ANG) is considered a
     MAJCOM and NGB/A3O is considered the equivalent of MAJCOM/A3T for purposes of
     this instruction.
     1.1.2. Link AFTTP 3-3.C-130H, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—C-130H requirements into
     mission and continuation training tables while retaining a combat culture, leading edge
     technologies, pushing capabilities while anticipating the warfighter needs.
     1.1.3. The secondary objective is to standardize C-130H training requirements into a single
     document to meet requirements for a basic document in AFI 11-200.
1.2. Key Words Explained.
     1.2.1. ―Will‖ and ―shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. ―Should‖ is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.2.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.2.4. ―Note‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
     to emphasize.
1.3. Administration.
     1.3.1. Recommendation for Change. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
     publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), AMC/A3TA, using the AF IMT
     847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through
     the appropriate functional’s chain of command. The OPR address is AMC/A3T, 402 Scott
     Drive, Unit 3A1, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5302.

   1.3.2. Local Training Procedures. Wings or groups may publish local training guidance;
   however, units may not change AFI guidance except where noted. Units will send one copy
   of their local training procedures to the parent MAJCOM Training OPR.
   1.3.3. This document refers to ancillary training requirements controlled by other AFI's and
   provides guidance derived from those AFI's. The governing AFI may be updated after the
   publication of this document, so it is necessary to refer to the source document AFI for
   current guidance. If a conflict is identified for an ancillary training requirement, comply with
   the source document that establishes the training requirement.
       1.3.4. All references to ―days‖ in this instruction refer to calendar days.

         and maintain minutes for a period of two years (commanders may increase this
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                             11


        frequency as required). Squadrons and detachments not collocated with their OG
        may conduct their own panel or provide representation to the unit's TRP. Panel
        minutes from non-collocated squadron and detachment TRPs will be forwarded to
        their OG training office for inclusion in their OG TRP.
        1.4.5.1.2. TRP Format. The TRP should review staff and crewmember management
        actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs.
        Suggested TRP topics include, but are not limited to current and forecast Flight
        Training Levels (FTL), upgrade and Continuation Training (CT) status, semi-annual
        requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft Commander,
        Instructor and Evaluator upgrades. Units should also review all unit-defined training
        ―X‖ events for relevancy.
     1.4.5.2. The OG/CC will develop and maintain procedures with their local servicing
     Military Personnel Flight (MPF) for individual crewmember counseling and personnel
     system updates affecting an Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) incurred from
     training described in this AFI. See AFI 11-202v1, AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
     Commitments, and course listing in ETCA for more information.
     1.4.5.3. The OG/CC may develop additional training requirements and/or programs as
     necessary to meet unit mission requirements. Units may include these requirements in
     local training procedures.
     1.4.5.4. The OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the academic
     training program for non-ATS courses (may be delegated to squadron level).
     AMC/A3TA is the POC for determining ATS vs. non-ATS Courses. The OG (or
     squadron OPR) will:
        1.4.5.4.1. Appoint primary and alternate instructors for each non-ATS course to be
        taught.
        1.4.5.4.2. Publish a ground training schedule to include date, time, location,
        instructor and designated crewmembers for each course. OG/CC may specify extra
        training periods as required.
        1.4.5.4.3. Use MAJCOM, ATS, or unit-developed training products and/or syllabus
        for all courses, as applicable. Units will reproduce non-ATS developed courseware as
        applicable.
        1.4.5.4.4. Develop a procedure to monitor the academic training program for course
        content, currency of materials, instructor availability, and status of training aids.
        Squadrons should recommend to the commander changes to existing courses or
        additional academic training courses required, based on crewmember feedback.
        1.4.5.4.5. Send recommendations for changes, additions, and deletions of courses
        through appropriate channels to appropriate MAJCOM with an information copy to
        AMC/A3T.
     1.4.5.5. Instructor Selection and Training. The OG/CC will select course instructors for
     non-ATS courses on the basis of professional qualifications and aptitude to teach. Local
     Academics instructor program will follow guidance in AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for
12                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


     Air Force Instructors. An individual who instructs a class will receive credit for that
     academic training requirement.
  1.4.6. Squadrons. Sq/CC or designated representative will:
     1.4.6.1. Select DOT Chiefs from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors.
     Previous Evaluator or FTU experience is highly desired. ARC units with a single Sq may
     use the OST Chief for this purpose.
     1.4.6.2. Ensure Sq/DOT is manned with a minimum of one instructor for each crew
     position. Instructors should be selected based on experience, availability, and time on
     station (to ensure continuity of operations for each crew position in DOT). ARC units
     with a single Sq may use the OST for this purpose.
     1.4.6.3. Convene a Squadron Training Review Panel (STRP) to be chaired by the Sq/CC
     and/or Sq/DO. Panel members should include representatives from squadron training,
     squadron stan/eval, ADOs, and the chief from each crew position. Sq/CCs should utilize
     the STRP to focus training objectives, ensure standards are being met, select upgrade
     candidates, and ensure completion of required continuation training.
         1.4.6.3.1. STRP Requirements. Squadrons will convene a STRP monthly (quarterly
         for AFRC and ANG) and maintain minutes for a period of two years. STRP minutes
         will be approved by the Sq/CC or DO and may be produced/distributed/stored
         electronically by the Sq/DOT. They will be maintained and disposed of in
         accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule referenced in the
         introduction.‖
         1.4.6.3.2. STRP Format. The squadron TRP should review staff and crewmember
         management actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training
         programs. The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that
         current training objectives are being met and that those individuals selected for
         upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency
         level, and retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include but
         are not limited to: crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification training
         (i.e. crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training (including
         performance during training and current certification status), future training
         (individuals already approved via STRP), upgrade candidates, current waivers,
         projected waivers, and continuation training status.
     1.4.6.4. Ensure crewmembers complete in-unit mission, ground, and continuation
     training programs. Failure to reasonably progress may require action for removal.
     1.4.6.5. Before each semi-annual training period, assign Flying Training Levels (FTL) to
     assigned and attached crewmembers (see Chapter 4).

1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training will not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 4515.13R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, and AFI 11-202v1.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at every level prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing training
       missions.
       1.6.1.2. See AFI 11-2C-130v3 for off-station training flight requirements.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification or special
   qualification training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of
   training resources, 618 TACC and tasked units will jointly identify and take maximum
   advantage of opportunities to conduct appropriate continuation training items which may be
   conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments. Examples include low-
   levels, assault landings, EROs, and circling approaches. If necessary 618th TACC and
   tasked-units will coordinate training mission numbers for the specific mission segment.
   Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the
 16                                                        AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


   crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
   Comply with passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 3.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2
Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to qualification (or requalification)
will be dedicated to that training program on a full-time basis (OG/CC will approve any
exceptions).
   1.7.1. Training time start date is the date when the first significant training event (a training
   event directly contributing to qualification, certification, or upgrade) has begun, e.g.,
   Computer-Based Training (CBT) lesson, Part Task Trainer (PTT), Weapon System Trainer
   (WST), ground training, flight, etc.; or 45-days (90-days ARC) after being attached or
   assigned to the unit after completion of the formal school; whichever occurs first. Training
   time ends with the syllabus completion.
   1.7.2. Units will notify the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) in writing before the
   crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits in Table 1.2. Sq/CC may extend listed
   training times up to 60 days (120 days ARC) provided appropriate documentation is included
   in the training folder. In such cases, notification to MAJCOM/A3T is not required.
        1.7.2.1. Extensions exceeding 60 days (120 days ARC) require MAJCOM/A3T (or
        equivalent) approval.
        1.7.2.2. Use the waiver request format specified in paragraph 1.5.8. Include training
        difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and estimated
        completion date.

        NOTES:
        1. Mission Certification time limit for cross-flow pilots is 120-days (240 days
           ARC).
        2. Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System. Normally accomplished in conjunction
           with lead or element lead training (see paragraph 5.6), but may also be
           accomplished separately or as part of Unit /Theater Indoctrination. If part of
           Unit/Theater Indoctrination, units may use the longest time period to complete the
           training.
1.8. Training Documentation. Units will use the AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew
Qualification Worksheet, to update aircrew certifications in ARMS. Section 2 will be used to
document award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers. Specifically, block 22 will contain the
―Q‖ code (i.e. QXXX) and Certification Name (i.e. Phoenix Banner). See Chapter 7 for specific
―Q‖ codes. See Attachment 2 for additional training documentation requirements.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight examiners as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. If a flight examiner is an individual’s primary or
recommending instructor, the same flight examiner should not administer the associated
evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below).
   1.10.2. When performing crewmember duties, the following personnel will be under direct
   supervision of an instructor of like specialty:
       1.10.2.1. All NMR crewmembers while performing the specific event(s) for which they
       are NMR (See paragraph 4.9).
       1.10.2.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training, unless
       syllabus states direct supervision is not required. Upgrade students may fly without an
       instructor when performing duties not related to the upgrade, unless otherwise restricted.
       Note: For students completing AWADS airdrop upgrade who are MR in Station Keeping
       Equipment (SKE) formation and SKE airdrop, an instructor pilot does not have to be in
       the seat. For pilots upgrading to NVG airdrop, formation lead or element lead who are
       MR in formation and airdrop events required by the appropriate syllabus, the instructor
       pilot does not have to be in the seat.
       1.10.2.3. For SKE or Visual formation (as required) and visual airdrop MR pilots who
       are NMR for NVG airdrop, SKE airdrop or AWADS airdrop and are trying to regain MR
       status, the instructor pilot does not have to occupy one of the pilot seats.
       1.10.2.4. Senior officers who have completed only the Senior Officer Course (SOC) A
       and/or B courses. (See paragraph 2.7.1).
       1.10.2.5. Any other personnel designated by the Wg/CC, OG/CC, or Sq/CC.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish distribution requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews.
 18                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


   1.12.1. Validated training completed prior to transfer will be honored by the gaining
   organization and will be used to determine the appropriate training phase and training level
   where the newly assigned crewmember is placed. Aircrew personnel qualified in the same
   mission-design-series (MDS) are considered qualified in that equipment throughout the force
   when used for the same mission. Difference training is required for a change in aircraft series
   between C-130E and C-130H (to include H, H1, H2 and H3) aircraft. For intracommand and
   intercommand transfers and exchange officers, instructor training and qualifications may be
   accepted at the discretion of the gaining Sq/CC.
      1.12.1.1. Foreign exchange officers should arrive at the duty station qualified in the C-
      130 with a current physical and current physiological training. Mission qualification
      training should also have been completed. Exchange officers arriving from the formal
      school will complete local proficiency flying, unit indoctrination and the following
      ground training events: Aircrew Flight Equipment, Aeromedical Rigging, Combat
      Offload, Initial Crew Resource Management (CRM), and marshalling exam. Those who
      arrive qualified from their country will complete the instrument refresher course (IRC),
      instrument written examination, simulator refresher, qualification open and closed-book
      examinations, flight evaluations, difference training, local proficiency and unit
      indoctrination. They will also complete physiological training, ground egress training,
      local area survival, and a flight physical if proper documentation cannot be produced.
      1.12.1.2. Requirements for foreign exchange officers to complete training that
      incorporates classified information, including G060 Tactics, G070 Aircrew Intelligence
      Training, G080 Communications Procedures, VT01/VT03 VTRAT Initial/Advanced, and
      M060 Theater Indoctrination Training will vary by country, security clearance, need to
      know, and specific exchange agreement. Consult the base Foreign Disclosure Officer
      (FDO) to determine an individual's eligibility to receive classified training. For example,
      some countries' exchange officers are only eligible to complete these events if they will
      deploy with their host U.S. unit. Some exchange officers may not complete any, and
      others have no restrictions and may complete all of these events.
      1.12.1.3. Partially mission qualified crewmembers (e.g., visual formation but not SKE)
      may be fully qualified in-unit with appropriate ATS courseware. Request waiver from
      MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent).
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is "duty not involving
flying" (DNIF) may complete ground training events, including simulator training, if the
member’s physical condition allows. Consult the flight surgeon initiating the AF Form 1042,
Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, if the DNIF status includes
ground training limitations.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AETC/A3R manages the training command’s
   role IAW AFI 11-202 V1. A key product of this process is the PFT. The PFT balances
   available training quotas, ATS throughput, schoolhouse capacities and course requirements
   on a Fiscal Year basis. Annually, units will send projected PFT requirements to their
   respective MAJCOM training staff, who in turn forward projections to HQ AF/A3O-AI, for
   inclusion into the Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD). AETC/A3R will
   determine training capacity and report shortfall in the GPRD to AF/A3O-AI.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                  19


       1.14.1.1. AF/A3O-AI sponsors an annual PFT conference for attendees to balance
       training capacity, MAJCOM training requests, and pipeline UPT/CSO/BFE/BLM
       students against Formal Training Unit (FTU) capacity. AETC/A3R allocates approved
       quotas to lead and each user command, which in-turn allocate training quotas to each
       unit. AETC/A3R publishes the annual PFT quota workbook on web site:
       https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AETCPFT.
       1.14.1.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AETC PFT
       managers use assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into
       the C-130 formal schools. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made
       on quota management documents.
1.15. Information Management. MAJCOMs may establish a training website to facilitate
information flow with the units. See unit training office or MAJCOM Supplement (if published)
for additional information. AMC hosts lead command training information and courseware
applicable to all C-130 units on the AMC/A3T Community of Practice (CoP) at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AMC_A3T                  and      the   AMC/A3TA        CoP      at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AMC_A3TA.
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus or training requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a
Progress Review (PR) IAW AFI 11-202V1.
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA). CEA qualifications are not tied to AFI 36-2101,
Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), skill-level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew
qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When an AF Form 8,
Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that
crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of
skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct
from On-The-Job (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in Air Force Specialty
Code (AFSC) by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix (aircrew flight examiner).
1.18. HQ AMC Orientation Tour / Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC)
Active duty units will be given priority over AFRC and ANG units due to mandatory
upgrade requirements for AMC crews established in AFI 11-MDS Volume 1. Do not
submit more than two candidates per wing per class without the GRACC scheduler's approval.
Submit names NET 45 days and NLT 30 days prior to CSD. AMC/A3TF will release the class
roster 30 days prior to CSD for units to confirm the names and make any necessary corrections.
Unfilled quotas will be available 14 days prior to CSD and units will be notified. Cancellations
must be received NLT four duty days prior to CSD to avoid a no-show. AMC/A3TF will not
accept any additions 72 hours/3 days prior to CSD. Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to CSD
to avoid a no-show being charged to the unit. No-shows will be handled IAW this paragraph.
Questions regarding GRACC Scheduling can be referred to AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-7881.
1.19. Senior Officer Training Coordination. All Senior Officer training is directed by
AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices (except ANG and AFRC) in coordination with MAJCOM Senior
Leaders Management office and AMC/A3TF and AETC/A3R. ANG and AFRC will develop
procedures to validate Senior Officer training requests. After validation, ANG and AFRC will
coordinate training with AETC/A3R and inform AMC/A3TF. Questions regarding the Senior
Officer training course, availability and prerequisites can be forwarded to AMC/A3TF @ DSN
 20                                                     AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


779-3577. Except for ANG and AFRC, no formal actions to schedule training will be taken until

                                            Chapter 2

                          INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202v1 defines initial qualification training. This chapter
specifies minimum training requirements for initial qualification, requalification, senior officer
courses, conversion, transition and difference training. The primary method of initial
qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course in the ETCA. When
attendance is not practical or a quota is not available, units will request a waiver to conduct in-
unit qualification training using formal school courseware.
2.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT) Prerequisites: Complete initial qualification
training prerequisites in accordance with AFI 11-202v1, this publication, and the course syllabus.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete syllabus and ancillary ground training
requirements for initial qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202v1 and this instruction.
   2.3.1. Table 2 1 only includes ground training requirements that specifically apply to
   aircrew. This AFI is not the directive authority for all ground training. Individuals are
   responsible for completing additional ancillary ground training requirements as specified in
   AFI 36-2201 and other applicable instructions.
   2.3.2. Initial Qualification Ground Training Events. Students entered into formal
   undergraduate and graduate training programs leading to aircrew qualification should
   accomplish the events listed in Table 2.1 Students accomplish many of the events in Table
   2.1 during undergraduate training prior to starting graduate training in C-130 formal courses.
   The FTU will document events accomplished during formal school training in the
   individual’s training record prior to graduation from the C-130 initial qualification course.
   Gaining units will ensure all initial qualification events are completed prior to completing
   mission certification. If in-unit initial or requalification training is accomplished in lieu of
   formal school attendance, the unit is responsible for ensuring all requirements are completed.
       2.3.2.1. Ground training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
       completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
       currency and requirements. Completion of Initial Combat SERE Training (SS20), Initial
       Water Survival Training (SS31), and initial aircrew flight equipment training during
       formal school establishes the due date (based on date of first completed course) for
       recurring Combat SERE (SS02), Conduct After Capture (SS03), Water Survival (SS05)
       and Emergency Parachuting Training (SS06). Completion of Initial Combat SERE
       Training (SS20) establishes the due date for recurring Law of Armed Conflict (G100).
       2.3.2.2. Training missions may be flown before completing all items listed, provided
       physiological training, physical, egress training, flight equipment familiarization training
       and marshalling training are accomplished.

  NOTES:
  1. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until event is accomplished.
  2. Not required for BAQ crewmembers (includes staff officers maintaining BAQ).
  3. Not required for Senior Officer Course graduates.
  4. All crewmembers will complete VT01; however, only affects mission ready status for
  units co-located with a VTRAT device.
  5. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on each crewmember’s Individual
  Training Summary (ITS). There is no need to assign and track these training events in the
  training module of ARMS. If units want to track in ARMS, use G005 and G006 per Chapter
  7.
  6. For crewmembers requiring NVG certification.
  7. LL06 should be accomplished in conjunction with SS02, LL03, or SS05. See Chapter
  7.
  8. Active Duty only.
  9. G002 is required when reporting for duty following PCS (N/A if tested at a formal school
  with in previous 6 months) IAW AFI 11-218.
2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with the formal school syllabus, AFI 11-202v1, and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion, Transition and Difference Training.
   2.5.1. Conversion Training. Conversion training normally requires completion of a formal
   school initial qualification course.
       2.5.1.1. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to
       begin aircrew conversion. If converting an entire unit and adequate training quotas are
       not available, qualified personnel from other units will normally provide the initial cadre.
       See AFI 11-202v2 for additional guidance on instructor evaluations. Units will publish a
       letter identifying initial cadre of instructors and flight examiners by crew qualification.
       2.5.1.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held,
       e.g., C-17 mission pilot (MP) to C-130 evaluator pilot (EP) unless previously qualified in
       the new aircraft.
   2.5.2. Transition Training. Transition Training is a shortened version of initial qualification
   training that gives aircrew members cross-flowing from another military aircraft credit for
   acquired aviation proficiency. Transition between the C-130J, C-130 AMP and C-130H will
   be accomplished using MAJCOM-approved training syllabi.
   2.5.3. Difference Training. Units complete difference training to certify crewmembers in a
   different mission-design-series (MDS) C-130 aircraft. Difference training is completed with
   an instructor sign-off. Use difference training when changing between aircraft and the
   amount of basic qualification training needed does not warrant attendance at a formal
   qualification course (e.g., EC-130 to C-130H). Difference training for pilots and flight
   engineers focuses on basic aircraft events and systems. Difference training for pilots and
   flight engineers does not include mission events. When crewmembers need to complete
   difference training, there may be additional mission training depending on the crewmember’s
24                                                      AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


  experience and aircraft equipment. Sq/CC or designated representative will determine
  mission training required. Instructor and Flight Examiner crewmembers converting from one
  C-130 to another may remain instructors or flight evaluators at the discretion of the gaining
  unit commander (or appropriate ARC Air Operations Officer). Send recommendations
  through MAJCOM channels to AMC/A3T when additional difference training requirements
  are identified. Prior to flying, ensure the minimum ground training requirements in paragraph
  3.3.1 are met. If units have any question on the training required, they should discuss the
  unit training plan with MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent).
     2.5.3.1. Pilot and Flight Engineer Difference Requirements. Units may conduct flying
     training in an aircraft or Aircrew Training System simulator at the discretion of the unit
     commander. Specific Difference Training courseware is available from 714 TRS.
         2.5.3.1.1. Difference from any legacy C-130 to C-130H (Super E — see Attachment
         1). Complete academics and flying training.
         2.5.3.1.2. Difference from any legacy C-130 to C-130H1. Complete academics and
         flying training. If units have C-130H and C-130H1 aircraft, crewmembers currently
         qualified on C-130E aircraft need only complete C-130E to C-130H1 difference
         training.
         2.5.3.1.3. Difference from any legacy C-130 to C-130H2. Complete academics and
         flying training. Differences between C-130H2s due to technical order modifications
         will be comprehensively briefed, but no flying is required.
         2.5.3.1.4. Difference from any legacy C-130 to C-130H3. Complete academics and
         flying training.
     2.5.3.2. Navigator Requirements for Difference Training. The Sq/CC or designated
     representative determines academics and flight training requirements. The academic
     training will include performance data and navigation equipment as a minimum. Flying
     training may be conducted in a simulator or satellite navigation trainer.
     2.5.3.3. Loadmaster requirements for Difference Training. Training shall be determined
     on an individual basis by the Sq/CC or designated representative based upon the
     crewmember’s proficiency (hands-on desired). As a minimum, conduct training on
     emergency equipment location and operation. Airdrop-qualified loadmasters converting
     from MC-130P or HC-130H/P/N to C-130H will attend Loadmaster Refresher Training
     (G602) in addition to difference training.
     2.5.3.4. Multiple Series C-130 Certifications. Pilots and flight engineers having multiple
     certifications that only require difference training (i.e., C-130E and C-130H3) will have a
     quarterly sortie currency in each aircraft. Use appropriate ARMS codes in Chapter 7
     (M130, M131, M132, M133, M134). These codes are optional if maintaining a single
     certification. The total FTL requirements for their applicable qualification-level
     semiannual continuation flying training requirements may be accomplished in any C-
     130H they are certified to fly. Loss of the quarterly currency requires a sortie in the
     respective series aircraft with an instructor. EXCEPTIONS: For all crewmembers, C-
     130H and C-130H1 are considered the same series and only require initial difference
     training. Sq/CC or designated representative will determine currency requirements for
     navigators and loadmasters based on aircraft equipment. If there is little or no difference
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                     25


       between aircraft, Sq/CCs may allow navigators and loadmasters to maintain certification
       in both aircraft without quarterly currency sorties in each aircraft.
       2.5.3.5. Difference training between the C-130J, C-130 AMP and C-130H is not
       applicable. Training between the C-130J, C-130 AMP and C-130H is transition training.
       (Exception: Loadmasters going from legacy to AMP is difference.)
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one MDS
aircraft for crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission requirements
and is justifiable and in the best interests of the command. This authority cannot be delegated
below the MAJCOM level (see AFI 11-202v1). Crewmembers will attend a formal initial
qualification course for multiple qualifications in different MDS aircraft (e.g., C-130H and C-
17). Crewmembers will, at a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in the C-130
(N/A for senior officers). Crewmembers will refer to the MDS-specific AFIs for training
requirements in the other aircraft. For units changing MDS aircraft, MAJCOMS may adjust
training requirements to align with numbers of assigned aircraft until the transition is complete.
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Training Requirements. AFI 11-202v1 identifies senior
officer qualification requirements. See formal course syllabus for additional guidance.
   2.7.1. Senior officer qualification is reserved for senior rated officer positions requiring
   operational flying (Aircrew Position Indicator codes 6 and 8, see AFI 11-401). This includes
   O-6 selects and above, and in some cases, O-5s permanently filling an O-6 position. Senior
   officers will attend the Senior Officer Course (pilot or navigator). The SOC-A and SOC-B
   courses result in a supervised status and basic aircraft qualification; these senior officers will
   fly with an instructor and maintain FTL E continuation training requirements. Senior officers
   who need to fly unsupervised, as determined by the OG/CC, may also complete the SOC-C
   or an in-unit course of instruction leading to unsupervised qualification. The SOC-C provides
   unsupervised basic aircraft qualification and the option for mission qualification. The host
   OSS/OST office is responsible for recommending a formal training course for initial
   qualification and mission qualification based on the senior officer’s flying experience and
   familiarity with the weapon system. After OG/CC review, MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
   will approve the proposed training plan prior to execution.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. See paragraph 3.6 for training requirements. Flight Surgeons are allowed
to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log time in their primary MDS while in training for
initial (mission) qualification.
2.9. Requalification Training. AFI 11-202v1 specifies requalification training limits and
requirements. See Attachment 3 for formal Aircrew Training System courses. The secondary
method of requalification is applicable if the formal course is required, but not practical, or
quotas are not available. Units will request a waiver from their parent MAJCOM. Unless
specified otherwise in AFI 11-202v1, a crewmember is unqualified upon expiration of the
qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (EXCEPTION: When
authorized multiple qualifications).
   2.9.1. AFI 11-202v1 requalification training limits and requirements also apply to loss of
   mission qualification or certification as specified in paragraph 4.9.
26                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


  2.9.2. For those events requiring certification but no recurring training such as Phoenix
  Banner and HALO, loss of aircraft qualification due to expiration of the qualification
  evaluation results in loss of those certifications. The Sq/CC will determine if training is
  required to regain certification. The Sq/CC should consider items to include the amount of
  time since expiration of aircraft qualification, crewmember's experience level, and any
  changes to the event when determining what, if any, training is required. If training is
  required, options could range from only ground training to the full syllabus for the
  certification.
  2.9.3. If in-unit requalification training is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance,
  the unit is responsible for ensuring all requirements in Table 2.1 have been previously
  completed.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 27


                                          Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
mission qualification and certification training. All crewmembers will complete initial
qualification prior to mission qualification training (MQT) and mission certification. Primary
method of mission qualification training is by attending the formal school and completing the
appropriate formal course syllabus. Except where specifically stated, units conducting training
may arrange mission sequence or sequence training events as necessary to use flying training
hours effectively and accomplish the training mission.
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Qualification and Certification Training. See Table 1.2 A
crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground training and flying
training requirements and certification by Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R& C) Board for
aircraft commander (AC) according to AFI 11-2C-130v2, C-130 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   3.2.1. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) and Pilot Cross-Flow Graduates (see Attachment
   3 for course descriptions). Upon completion of all cross-flow training requirements and prior
   to the Operational Mission Certification (OMC) and Aircraft Commander Certification, a
   MPD or cross-flow graduate will be designated as a MR pilot (FPC/FPQ or FPL) for Status
   of Resources and Training System (SORTS) and TRP purposes and may fly as a qualified
   pilot on any crew including operational missions. MPD and pilot cross-flow graduates may
   not fly as a pilot-in-command until certified as an aircraft commander.
   3.2.2. Aircraft Commander Certification. After completing a MPD Pilot Check-Out Course
   (PCO), the maximum time period for pilots to be certified as an aircraft commander is 90
   days (120 days for PXA-C cross-flow graduates). ARC units use 180 days and 240 days. If
   individuals are unable to complete certification within these limits, their units will notify
   MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) with a description of the difficulty and expected certification
   date. The time period starts when the individual performs the first event leading to aircraft
   commander certification following their return from the FTU course or completion of the
   PCO Course if accomplished locally.
   3.2.3. ARMS Tracking. Pilots will initially be coded IAW Table 5.2 for ARMS tracking.
   Newly assigned crewmembers who are initially qualifying or requalifying in the unit mission
   will be counted as basic qualified (FP for pilots, FN for navigators, FF for flight engineers,
   FL for loadmasters) for ARMS and TRP purposes. This is for ARMS tracking only and does
   not affect the crewmember’s aircraft qualification on the AF Form 8. Upon completion of all
   ground and flying training requirements, units will certify the crewmembers as mission ready
   and change the ARMS codes to reflect mission qualified.
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all syllabus and ancillary ground training
events in Tables 2.1 and 3.1 before certification as mission ready. Training may be
accomplished concurrently with other training.
   3.3.1. Training missions may be flown before completing all items listed in Tables 2.1 and
   3.1, provided physiological training, flight physical, emergency egress training, local area
   survival, aircrew flight equipment familiarization training and marshalling training are
   accomplished.

   3.3.2. Ground training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful final evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
   currency and requirements. See paragraph 2.3.2.
   3.3.3. Formal School OG/CCs, the Commandant USAF Weapons School (USAFWS), and
   Commander Advanced Airlift Tactical Training Center (AATTC) may determine, obtain
   MAJCOM approval, and publish ground and flying training requirements for their units in
   local training procedures.

 NOTES:
 Previously certified and qualified mission ready crewmembers transferring between units or in
 a cross-flow program (between flying units) only need any applicable events in which they
 have lost currency.
 1. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station. See event description in
 Chapter 7.
 2. Required for theater-assigned or deployed crewmembers as determined by Sq/CC. See
 event description in Chapter 7 for additional details.

3.4. Flying Training Requirements.
   3.4.1. BAQ crewmembers pursuing MR status will be assigned a Flight Training Level and
   accomplish continuation training requirements IAW Chapter 4. Continuation training
   requirements will be prorated based on the training time start date as defined in paragraph
   1.7.1. Crewmembers will credit events accomplished during Mission Certification Training
   (MCT) IAW paragraph 4.4.1. Crewmembers pursuing MR status who fail to accomplish
   minimum aircrew requirements (currency and semi-annual) must fly in a supervised status
   when that event is required for a particular flight.
       3.4.1.1. Crewmembers in MCT who fail to accomplish all semi-annual training
       requirements must complete training IAW paragraph 4.9.2.2 prior to awarding MR
       status. On a case-by-case basis, the Sq/CC may review the crewmember's training
       accomplished and waive incomplete requirements as required. (Document the waiver in
       the crewmember’s training folder.) Crewmembers non-current for an event may be
       certified MR on a case-by-case basis, but the crewmember will remain NMR for that
       event and will be supervised on any flight requiring that event IAW paragraph 4.9.2.2.
       After arrival at duty station, all crewmembers will receive a local area briefing and a local
       orientation/mission ready (MR) flight. For pilots, the MR flight may be substituted by a
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                    29


     simulator sortie focused on events specific to the unit’s mission. If a simulator is used for
     the MR sortie, the local orientation flight remains a separate requirement (not applicable
     for in-unit, re-qualification or upgrade training). The lack of a local briefing and local
     flight does not preclude the crewmember from flying as MR.
     3.4.1.2. After arrival at duty station all crewmembers will receive a local area briefing
     and supervised local orientation flight (not applicable for in-unit initial, requalification or
     upgrade training). The lack of a local briefing and local flight does not preclude the
     crewmember from deploying as MR.
  3.4.2. Newly assigned crewmembers who are initially qualifying or requalifying in the unit
  mission will fly under the direct supervision of a like position instructor until completion of
  Unit Indoctrination and difference training (as required). After completing all flying training
  events and prior to completing all ground training events, Sq/CCs may allow crewmembers
  to fly unsupervised on training flights provided the remaining ground training items do not
  affect mission accomplishment for that flight.
  3.4.3. Navigators. High altitude low opening (HALO) and high altitude high opening
  (HAHO) aerial delivery are special certifications and are not required for MR status. See
  paragraph 5.13.
  3.4.4. Loadmasters. High winds or non-availability of parachutists may cause loadmasters
  to complete the FTU mission qualification course without obtaining actual personnel airdrop
  certification. In these cases, use standard airdrop training bundles (SATB) during flight
  training. Actual personnel airdrop certification will be accomplished in-unit. Document the
  substitution according to Attachment 2 and AFI 11-2C-130v2. Accomplish final
  certification for personnel airdrop in-unit under the supervision of an instructor loadmaster or
  flight examiner loadmaster on an actual static line personnel airdrop.
  3.4.5. Assault Landing Training. Conduct assault takeoff and landing initial qualification
  training on a landing zone (or painted landing zone) of 3,000 feet or longer. Maximum effort
  takeoffs should be performed from the main runway when it is available (i.e., safe and
  practical to taxi from an assault landing zone). See AFI 11-2C-130v3 for additional guidance
  on maximum effort takeoffs.
  3.4.6. Units North of the 60 Parallel. Crewmembers in units north of the 60 N parallel who
  are scheduled to complete secondary method (in-unit) mission qualification training during
  the period 1 April through 30 September, have until 30 September to complete the required
  night training events, even if this exceeds the training time limitations in Table 1.2. The
  mission qualification evaluation for these crewmembers may be administered before
  completing night training events.
  3.4.7. Joint Airborne and Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) Missions. When
  participating in JA/ATT missions, unqualified and non-current crewmembers may be utilized
  in their respective crew positions provided they are supervised by an instructor or flight
  examiner. Comply with direct supervision requirements of AFI 11-401 when carrying
  passengers (including paratroopers).
  3.4.8. AWADS Training. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130 and AFI 11-2C-130v3 for additional
  AWADS information. Accomplish training according to ATS courseware and local training
  guides.
 30                                                        AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


3.5. Aircraft Defensive Systems (ADS). ADS Training is not a separate certification, but all
aircrew will receive Aircraft Defensive System (ADS) training (applicable to the unit’s ADS
configuration) during Unit Indoctrination or difference training. Training will include ground and
flight training for all crewmembers. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130, Attachment 3 for unclassified
information on aircraft defensive systems. See AFTTP 3-1.C-130 for more in-depth classified
information on all C-130 defensive systems and defensive reactions. Training should be
conducted by a graduate of the USAF Weapons School, Mobility Electronic Combat Officers
Course (MECOC), or as designated by the unit commander.
   3.5.1. Ground Training. Academic training will cover as a minimum, basic principles of
   Infrared (IR) threats and flares, basic principles of radar and chaff (only applicable to unit’s
   with a Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) on their aircraft), how ADS work, how to operate the
   system, use of checklists, malfunctions, emergency procedures, and defensive maneuvers
   during takeoff, low-level, medium/high altitude, airdrop and landing.
   3.5.2. Flight Training. Flight training will cover preflight actions, aircraft walk-around,
   system turn-on, system test and a flight profile that should include defensive maneuvers from
   high/medium altitude, during a low-level, after slowdown and before a simulated airdrop,
   and a simulated approach to landing. Calls for in-flight reactions (simulated ADS inputs or
   simulated visual sightings) should come either directly from the instructor or as a result of
   the instructor’s input to an aircrew member.
3.6. Flight Surgeon Mission Qualification Requirements. Before deploying or acting as
aircrew in any aircraft, flight surgeons must fly at least two sorties in their primary aircraft,
complete all required ground training events listed in Table 4.3 (for the primary aircraft), and
accomplish flight surgeon testing on the AFDL website.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                  31


                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain an assigned aircrew training status. The unit commander will ensure
each crewmember receives sufficient training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. Squadron commanders will assign C-130 crewmembers an aircrew status
using the following criteria:
   4.2.1. Mission Ready.      For SORTS, operational tasking, and deployments, a MR
   crewmember is defined as one who is available and qualified in the unit’s mission
   (completed mission certification for the applicable crew position).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See
   paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in
   required continuation training.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A crewmember who has satisfactorily completed
   mission qualification training, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not
   maintain MR status. The crewmember maintains familiarization in the command or unit’s
   operational mission. Includes crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM, NAF and other line and
   non-line units.
       4.2.3.1. The crewmember shall be able to attain full unit mission certification to meet
       operational taskings within 45 days.
       4.2.3.2. The OG/CC may define a portion of the unit’s operational mission and declare
       an assigned or attached crewmember Mission Ready if all training requirements for that
       part of the operational mission are met. The crewmember does not need to attain full
       mission certification unless directed by the OG/CC.
       4.2.3.3. Formal School BMC crewmembers are qualified to conduct all aspects of the
       formal training mission. Formal school instructors will be qualified and certified in the
       training/unit mission before performing instructor duties. Formal school crewmembers
       may fly other than training missions, but they will comply with any MR requirements
       required for that mission.
       4.2.3.4. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the
       mission for which they are current and qualified. See AFI 11-401 for additional
       information on logging instructor time.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). Aircrew may be designated BAQ after
   completion of C-130 qualification training (initial or requalification).
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers will accomplish and/or maintain the requirements
   in AFI 11-202v1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground and
   semi-annual flying continuation tables in this AFI.
4.3. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
 32                                                         AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


   4.3.1. The Sq/CC determines the FTL before each semi-annual period. Assign new unit
   crewmembers a FTL during in-processing. Base FTL on experience and aircraft proficiency.
   Crewmembers may have a different FTL for different flying qualifications, (i.e. a
   crewmember may be a FTL A basic proficiency aircraft commander but a FTL C airdrop
   pilot).
       4.3.1.1. FTL A Highly Experienced Crewmembers. Sq/CC may assign highly
       experienced MR line crewmembers to this level. In addition, this may include MR or
       NMR MAJCOM headquarters, 618 TACC personnel, AETC instructors, NAF personnel,
       USAF Expeditionary Center (EC) instructors, USAFWS instructors, AATTC instructors,
       wing, OG, and Sq/CCs, Sq/DOs, personnel assigned to OG evaluation positions, and any
       instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. NOTE: NMR crewmembers assigned to
       MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, Expeditionary Mobility Task Force (EMTF), 618 TACC,
       USAF Expeditionary Center (EC), Contingency Response Group (CRG), Air Mobility
       Operations Group (AMOG), FTU, or direct reporting unit may be categorized as BMC
       and assigned to FTL A. These individuals may fly unsupervised on any mission provided
       they are current and qualified for that mission.
       4.3.1.2. FTL B Experienced MR Crewmember.
       4.3.1.3. FTL C MR Crewmember. Initially assign inexperienced crewmembers to FTL
       C.
       4.3.1.4. FTL D No longer used.
       4.3.1.5. FTL E—BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. May include senior officers,
       MAJCOM, NAF, EMTF and 618 TACC staff who are not maintaining MR or instructor
       status. FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status and crewmembers assigned to
       this FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times. For pilots, an instructor
       will be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight. In addition, FTL E pilots will
       be current in takeoffs, landings, and instrument approaches before carrying passengers.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. Prorate events upon changing training levels or training tables.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and description
are located in Chapter 7. Designate unit defined events as ―X‖ event (i.e. X020). Units will
include a description in their local training procedures.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit events accomplished on training, operational
   missions and satisfactory evaluations or certifications toward flying requirements and
   establish a subsequent due date. Use date of successful evaluation as the date of
   accomplishment for all ground training events that were trained during a formal course. For
   flying training events, a successful flight evaluation establishes a new current and qualified
   reference date for all flying events required during the semi-annual period. See AFI 11-2C-
   130v2 for specific evaluation details. For flying training during upgrade training, numbers of
   events accomplished prior to the evaluation are credited to the requirements for the current
   crew position. For flying training during initial qualification or requalification training,
   numbers of events accomplished prior to the evaluation are not credited to any crew position.
   In all cases, numbers of events successfully accomplished on the evaluation or certification
   are credited toward the new crew position.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 33


     4.4.1.1. Crewmembers pursuing in-unit MR status will be assigned a Flying Training
     Level (FTL) during in-processing and accomplish continuation training and unit MR
     requirements. Continuation training requirements will be prorated based on the training
     time start date as defined in paragraph 1.7.1. Crewmembers will credit events
     accomplished during unit MR training toward the new crew position with the exception
     of those events not trained during initial training (i.e.; AWADS) or those events restricted
     on the initial AF Form 8 (i.e.; personnel airdrop). Those events may be credited on the
     certification/qualification flight for that event. Crewmembers pursuing MR status who
     fail to accomplish minimum aircrew requirements (currency and semi-annual) must fly in
     a supervised status when that event is required for a particular flight.
     4.4.1.2. The failure to accomplish semi-annual training requirements during unit MR
     training must be rectified prior to awarding MR status. On a case-by-case basis, the
     Sq/CC may review the crewmember's semi-annual training accomplished during unit MR
     training and waive incomplete requirements as required. (Document the waiver in the
     crewmember’s training folder.) The goal is to ensure the new crewmember is ready to
     assume MR status in all areas of the unit mission. On a case-by-case basis, Sq/CC may
     declare crewmembers MR if still NMR for an event, but the crewmember will remain
     NMR for that event and will be supervised on any flight requiring that event IAW
     Paragraph 4.9.1.
     4.4.1.3. If the new crewmember is maintaining the same FTL or training table after
     attaining MR status, no additional proration is required or allowed.
     4.4.1.4. Units may develop local mission accomplishment reports and/or training
     accomplishment reports to document continuation training for processing into ARMS.
     See AFI 11-202v1 for additional guidance.
  4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not log continuation training requirements
  for those events graded Q-3 (according to AFI 11-2C-130v2) until re-qualified. The unit
  commander will determine which events will be allowed for credit based on AF Form 8
  evaluation description.
  4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
  4.4.4. Instructor and flight examiner training requirements and responsibilities. Instructors
  and flight examiners may credit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or
  evaluating. EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs or
  landings flown by another pilot.
  4.4.5. Crewmembers should see event descriptions in Chapter 7 for additional details on
  crediting specific events.
  4.4.6. Documenting Aircrew Training.
     4.4.6.1. All training events will be recorded in ARMS.
         4.4.6.1.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
         consolidated under one ARMS entry.
         4.4.6.1.2. Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry.
 34                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


             4.4.6.1.3. Input all one-time events and events required for permanent change-of-
             station (PCS) in the ARMS database. Units may maintain one-time events on the
             crewmember’s currency report.
   4.4.6.2. See Attachment 2 for additional requirements.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is ultimately the responsibility of the
   individual crewmember. Crewmembers should actively work with unit schedulers and
   training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this
   chapter.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Tables 4.1
   and 4.2.
       4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 or Table 4.3 leads to non-mission
       ready status. See paragraph 4.9 for regaining mission ready status.
       4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
       non-mission ready status but may restrict crewmember from certain missions.
       4.5.2.3. Crewmembers (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, USAF EC, etc.) attached to units may
       accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment. The
       crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of
       attachment (ARMS office).
       4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 24 hours) may
       accomplish ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission
       accomplishment. Specify additional requirements and or restrictions in MAJCOM
       supplement or local training procedures.
       4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3.

   NOTES:
   1. Mandatory grounding item on expiration date; individual will not fly until required
   training is accomplished. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous
   physical, and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF Form 1042, whichever
   occurs first. The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual
   physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455
   days. Flight physical and physiological training are independently tracked via the
   crewmember’s Individual Training Summary (ITS) and thus do not require an ARMS
   code. If units want to track in ARMS, use G005 and G006 per Chapter 7.
   2. Log IRC upon completion of the complete course to include instructor-led Hot Topics.
   Pilots on active flying status will complete the IRC every fourth quarter after completion
   IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Program.
   3. Wing level and below. G220 incorporates hostile environment repair and G602
   incorporates Loadmaster Aerial Delivery (LAD).
   4. Not required for Senior Officer Course graduates.
   5. Not required for BAQ or BMC crewmembers.
   6. Units should conduct tactics training semiannually with emphasis on current tactics
   changes and techniques. OG/CCs may specify an alternate frequency for Tactics
   Training, but not less than annual, provided unit crewmembers receive all G060 blocks of
   training annually.
   7. OG/CCs may approve an extension of up to six months for aircrews.
   8. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.9.3.4.

      9. Aircrew Flight Equipment Training (LL06) should be accomplished in conjunction
      with SS02, LL03 and SS05. See event description in Chapter 7.
      10. AFI 11-2C-130v1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event.
      11. Crewmembers completing refresher simulator can take credit for G230, CRM
      Refresher.
      12. For NVG certified crewmembers only. Crewmembers who are overdue NV03 may
      fly unsupervised on missions not requiring NVG use.
      13. Must be accomplished with at least one qualified Aircraft Commander on the crew.
      (ARC may substitute an FTL A FPQ for an AC, if needed).

NOTES:
1. Mandatory grounding item.
2. Flight surgeons without an aviation unit mobility requirement (e.g. non-operational staff or
leadership role in Aerospace Medicine, and flight surgeons undergoing training in the USAF
Residency in Aerospace Medicine) do not need to accomplish this training.
3. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.9.1.4. for
flight surgeon loss of currency.
4. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or change in MDS.
5. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the 455th
day or as indicated on the AF Form 1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may
vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by a flight
surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days.
6. AFI 11-2C-130v1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event.
7. S-V80-A and S-V80-B establish initial training completion dates for SS02, SS03 and SS06.
8. Flight surgeons must fly at least 50 percent of their annual requirements in primary unit
aircraft unless deployed away from their primary unit for more than 90 days.
9. Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one sortie per
single calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual sortie requirements.
10. A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight
duration or one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in AFI 11-401.


   4.5.3. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 list flying
   continuation training requirements. See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
       4.5.3.1. Dual-Seat Qualification. The following defines the allowed cockpit seat
       assignment depending on crew training and qualification. AFI 11-2C-130v3 further
       defines C-130 takeoff and landing policy for C-130 pilots.
           4.5.3.1.1. MPD Graduate (FPC or FPQ). See Paragraph 5.2.
           4.5.3.1.2. Aircraft Commander Course Graduates (FPL). Prior to certification,
           graduates of an aircraft commander course (aircraft commander upgrade or cross-
           flow from another weapon system) can only accomplish pilot-flying assault landings
           and takeoffs when under direct instructor supervision. These pilots may accomplish
           other pilot-flying/pilot-monitoring events in either seat with an aircraft commander in
           the other seat.
           4.5.3.1.3. Aircraft Commanders. Aircraft commanders may not accomplish right-
           seat pilot-flying assault events unless under direct IP supervision. Aircraft
           commanders may fly in the right seat and supervise MPD Phase II pilots for
           proficiency/basic events.
           4.5.3.1.4. IPs may accomplish pilot-flying events in either seat with any pilot in the
           other seat.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 39


        4.5.3.2. Simulator Credit for Training Requirements. Crewmembers may credit flight
        training events in the simulator per Table 4.4 and Table 4.5. For ARMS tracking,
        simulator events will be coded with a ―S‖ prefix, or within ARMS use the Restrictions
        tab under Profile Task Information.
        4.5.3.3. Continuation Training Flying. Each MAJCOM provides flying hours to each
        wing as training, test, and ferry hours or operations and maintenance (O & M) hours. The
        hours, based on Aircraft Commander FTL C, are designed to provide all crew positions
        with sufficient hours to accomplish all continuation flying training requirements.
        4.5.3.4. Mission profile simulators (G250, G240, G600) will be flown in the same
        manner as the aircraft, to include the wear and use of professional gear (headsets,
        helmets, etc.)
           4.5.3.4.1. Simulator sorties will be scheduled as ground events in GDSS (if able) and
           sortie cancellation authority will reside with the OG/CC (or designated
           representative.)
           4.5.3.4.2. Pre-requisites (if required) for simulator training must be completed prior
           to the sim start time or the training will be cancelled.
        4.5.3.5. Units North of the 60 Parallel. OG/CCs are authorized to waive all night
        continuation training events (including currency events) from 1 April through 31
        October. Training events will be prorated for each semi-annual period (see paragraph
        4.8).
           4.5.3.5.1. Any crewmember who is current for night training events as of 1 April will
           remain current through 31 October. Any crewmember non-current for these events
           prior to 1 April will remain non-current until accomplishing the event with an
           instructor.

 NOTES:
 1. MAJCOM and NAF engineers and loadmasters require one proficiency sortie every 90
 days. For all crewmembers, currency will expire at the end of the calendar month. Unqualified
 in the aircraft if non-current for M010 in excess of 6 months.
 2. One event due annually. OG/CC is waiver authority.
 3. ARC loadmasters require only one annually. For personnel airdrop, ARC loadmasters
 disregard Note 4.
 4. If FTL A block is blank, training requirement is one event due annually.
 5. Actual load required (not SATB). Loadmasters log AD05A for Personnel Airdrop.
 6. Flight Engineers may log 50% (Rounded up; 100% if requirement is 1) in any USAF-
 certified WST (does not have to be Level C or better). See paragraph 4.5.3.2 for ARMS
 tracking guidance. Flight Engineers can maintain and regain currency in the simulator.
 7. P280 is Triennial for FTL A, Biennial for FTL B, and Annual for FTL C.
 8. JPADS certified crewmembers only.
 9. Loadmasters unqualified in airdrop if non-current in excess of 6 months.
 10. Consecutive periods will alternate between static-line retriever and manual gate cut
 procedures to satisfy continuation requirements (i.e. if a manual gate cut is used to credit the
 requirement, a static-line retriever initiated airdrop must be accomplished for the next period).



4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Training Flying Requirements. Flight surgeons will
comply with the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202v1. Flight surgeons require one
sortie in any qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202v1 for flying continuation training
requirements. See Table 4.3 for flight surgeon continuation training requirements.
   4.6.1. Any flight surgeon logging time in the C-130 as a secondary airframe, or any AMC-
   assigned flight surgeon logging time in any DoD or foreign military aircraft in which they are
   granted authorization to fly by the local unit, must be on Aeronautical Orders assigning ASC
   8A status and be current in their periodic flight physical and physiological training. The AC
   or their designated representative must also give the flight surgeon a briefing on oxygen
   equipment and egress procedures prior to flight. NOTE: Initial Qualification requirements
   (in Chapters 2 and 3) only apply to the Flight Surgeon's primary aircraft.
       4.6.1.1. For contingency/AOR missions, Flight Surgeons must also be current in the
       following events (in their primary aircraft): SS02, SS03, SS06, and G120.
4.7. Additional Ancillary Training. Ancillary Training is any guidance or instruction that
contributes to mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or
occupational series. Some ancillary training does not impact mission ready status or mobility
status. AFI 11-2C-130v1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training
events. Individuals are responsible for completing additional ancillary ground training
requirements as specified in applicable instructions. In accordance with AFI 11-202v1, the
source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver has been
authorized. See Unit Deployment Manager to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew
specific training requirements.
 46                                                        AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202v1 describes proration of training requirements for
crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability due
to contingency alerts and contingency flying temporary duty (TDY) when the contingency
precludes training for certain mission events (for PACAF: includes contingency operations from
home station). This authority will be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same
crewmember for consecutive semi-annual training periods.
   4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: number of months available
   times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down
   to the nearest whole number, but not less than 1 (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5).
       4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.6 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
       absence is at least 15 cumulative days.
       4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
       to a unit flying the same MDS aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
       accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
       available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
       available) during the training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for
       Continental United States (CONUS) and 14-days after sign-in for Outside the Continental
       United States (OCONUS) or on the date of actual accomplishment of the first training
       event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated total
       to determine remaining requirements.
   4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels. If
   requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

Table 4.6. Individual Availability.
                   Days Available                         Months Available

4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation training requirements,
or fail to complete ground continuation training requirements. The following guidance applies:
   4.9.1. Loss of Currency. Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in the flying
   continuation training tables accomplished in a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly,
   semi-annual, or annual as listed in the ―CUR‖ column). Loss of currency prohibits an
   individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the non-current event(s).
       4.9.1.1. Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in a NMR training
       status and ensure they are supervised by an instructor when performing those events for
       which they are non-current.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                               47


     4.9.1.2. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires (i.e., a
     crewmember that accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 May becomes non-
     current on 1 July).
     4.9.1.3. Sq/CC will direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status or
     request an OG/CC waiver for the requirement. Base the decision to approve a waiver on
     the individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level. Do not approve a waiver
     request for the same flying training event deficiency affecting consecutive training
     periods (if a waiver is desired for consecutive training periods, forward request for
     MAJCOM approval).
     4.9.1.4. Flight surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM
     Command Surgeon of flight surgeons exceeding 60-days between sorties. Flight
     surgeons that exceed 60 days between sorties require a review of aircraft exits and
     oxygen systems conducted by a member of the flight crew designated by the aircraft
     commander prior to the flight to regain flying currency.
         4.9.1.4.1. The egress review will be signed off by the aircraft commander on an
         approved form (e.g., AF 1522, locally generated form/memo, etc.)               Note:
         documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable. The flight surgeon must submit this
         documentation to the local Squadron/Host Aviation Resource Manager
         (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or upon return to home station if the flight is in
         conjunction with a TDY. The HARM or SARM will place the documentation in the
         flight surgeon’s training folder.
         4.9.1.4.2. Failure to complete and document required training before the flight will
         result in the loss of ability to log primary flight surgeon time.
         4.9.1.4.3. Flight surgeons that exceed 6-months between sorties require completion
         of LL03, Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat, with an aircrew instructor
         prior to the next flight.
  4.9.2. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events. At the end of each training
  period, the Sq/CC will review ARMS products for crewmembers that fail to accomplish all
  flying continuation training requirements. Failure to complete semi-annual requirements
  prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the specific
  event(s).
     4.9.2.1. Place individuals delinquent in one or more events in a NMR training status and
     ensure they are supervised by an instructor when performing those events for which they
     are delinquent.
     4.9.2.2. Sq/CC will direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status using
     the same process as regaining currency or request an OG/CC waiver for the requirement.
     Base the decision to approve a waiver on the individual crewmember’s experience and
     proficiency level. Do not approve a waiver request for the same flying training event
     deficiency affecting consecutive training periods (if a waiver is desired for consecutive
     training periods, forward request for MAJCOM approval).
  4.9.3. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.
 48                                                      AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


       4.9.3.1. Failure to complete Ground Continuation training events in Table 4.1 and Table
       4.3 leads to NMR status. NMR status prohibits an individual from accomplishing
       unsupervised in-flight duties until the delinquent event is accomplished or waived.
       4.9.3.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
       NMR status but may restrict crewmember from certain missions.
       4.9.3.3. If a Flight Surgeon fails to complete Ground Continuation Training events in
       Table 4.3, the Sq/CC (or his designated representative) will determine the Flight
       Surgeon’s status based on mission requirements.
       4.9.3.4. The OG/CC may waive some ground continuation training events as identified
       in Tables 4.1 and 4.2. This waiver extends the due date and does not delete the
       requirement. This waiver authority will be used judiciously. The decision to grant a
       waiver will be based on the individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level.
       OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver. The make-up training
       should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This waiver is for unforeseen
       circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplishment.
       4.9.3.5. With the exception of mandatory grounding items, crewmembers NMR for
       events in Table 4.1 may fly unsupervised on CONUS and OCONUS missions as long as
       the crewmembers do not accomplish the specific event(s) that put them into NMR
       training status. OG/CC approval not required for local, routine, and non-contingency
       missions. The crewmember may serve as pilot-in-command. An individual NMR for
       failure to complete Hazardous Cargo Training (G182) may only fly unsupervised on local
       training missions not requiring the overdue event with Sq/CC (or their designated
       representative) approval.

AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                  49


NOTES:
1. Includes all Proficiency/Basic events listed in Tables 4.4 and 4.5. See NVG items for NVG
restrictions. (Example: NMR due to landing requires instructor supervision for any landing.
NMR due to NVG Landing restricts NVG landings but does not affect unaided landings). Only
includes Category 1 Navigation Sortie or Grid Navigation if planned for the mission. If not
planned, crewmembers are restricted from performing those events, but they may fly without
instructor supervision. Pilots NMR due to unaided night events may fly unsupervised on local
training day missions as long as they are MR for corresponding day events planned for the
mission. If a MPD pilot is NMR due to left-seat events, he/she may continue to perform right-
seat duties without restriction as long as he/she is current in required right-seat events. If a
flight engineer or loadmaster is NMR due to M050, Tactical Mission, the crewmember may
still fly a Proficiency Sortie as long as no mission events requiring a tactical checklist are
planned or flown.
2. Includes formation departure and recovery events. Does not include airdrop.
3. Unaided night VLL and night airdrop events are no longer required. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130
and/or AFI 11-2C-130v3.
4. Airdrop events may be divided into equipment, personnel, CDS or JPADS/I-CDS airdrop
events. For example, a navigator or loadmaster may be NMR due to a personnel drop, but that
does not affect equipment or CDS if not delinquent in those events. For pilots and navigators,
PADS Operator NMR status does not affect other airdrop events.


  4.9.4. Crewmembers NMR for Flying Training Events.
      4.9.4.1. NMR crewmembers may fly unsupervised with OG/CC approval on CONUS
      and OCONUS missions provided events in the delinquent category are not to be
      accomplished (OG/CC approval not required for local, routine, and non-contingency
      missions). E.g. A pilot crewmember may serve as a pilot in command. Use Table 4.7 as a
      guide. Note: An individual placed in NMR status for loss of currency in takeoffs (P020),
      landings (P190), or approaches (P070), will not fly unsupervised on any sortie.
      4.9.4.2. Regaining Currency or Mission-Ready Status.
          4.9.4.2.1. Non-current or NMR for up to 6 months. The crewmember will
          demonstrate proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as appropriate as defined in
          Tables 4.4, 4.5, 5.8 or 5.9) with an instructor in all delinquent items. If using a
          simulator, instruction may be provided by a like-position ATS instructor.
          Crewmembers non-current or NMR for less than 6 months will maintain their current
          training level (no training folder required).
          4.9.4.2.2. Non-current or NMR exceeding 6-months. For Proficiency/Basic events
          identified in Tables 4.4 and 4.5, the crewmember is unqualified in the aircraft and
          will complete Sq/CC-directed requalification training and an aircrew evaluation
          according to AFI 11-2C-130v2 (see Table 4.7, Note 1 for clarification and
          exceptions). If NMR due to Assault, Visual Low-Level, SKE, or Airdrop events
          exceeding six months, the aircrew member is unqualified in the appropriate mission
          event and will complete requalification as directed in paragraph 2.9 (Exception:
          Flight evaluation not required if event only requires certification). Use Table 4.7 as a
 50                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


           guide for grouping events. NMR due to NVG events does not affect the unaided event
           (e.g., NMR due to NVG airdrop does not affect airdrop). Crewmembers will regain
           NVG certification by flying with an instructor for the particular NVG event. NMR
           due to Miscellaneous Flying Training Events exceeding six months requires
           proficiency to be demonstrated in the aircraft, simulator or verbally debriefed (except
           for P280, Aircrew Chemical Defense Task Qualification Training (ACDTQT)) to the
           satisfaction of a like-position qualified instructor in all delinquent items.
4.10. Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Rated Members on Active Flying Status. AFI
11-202v1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
4.11. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying Status. AFI 11-202v1 specifies
requirements before removal from active flying.
4.12. Requirements While in Inactive Flying Status. AFI 11-202v1 specifies requirements
while in inactive flying status.
4.13. Retraining. AFI 11-202v1 specifies retraining restriction before separation, retirement, or
mandatory inactive flying status.
4.14. Aircrew Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force Units. AFI
11-202v1 addresses individuals flying in this status.
4.15. Training Period. Continuation training program is based on static 6-month periods (1
January – 30 June and 1 July – 31 December). MAJCOMs may adjust training periods based on
unique mission requirements (e.g. Antarctic ski mission).

                                  UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade.
   5.1.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the crewmember
   having gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit’s
   missions. Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas.

 NOTES:
 1. Cross-flow pilots will have 100 total C-130 hours prior to certification to aircraft
 commander (includes time at the formal school but does not include ―other‖ time).
 2. Refer all Rotary Wing pilots to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) for a training
 recommendation
 3. MF will have a X1A151 primary AFSC (or higher); X1A171 is desired.
 4. ML will have a X1A251 primary AFSC (or higher); X1A271 is desired.
 5. Airdrop qualified ML will have a minimum of 15 actual aerial delivery sorties of which a
 minimum of 10 will be some combination of actual equipment or CDS events.
 6. C-130 simulator time is creditable towards PAA Time. Simulator time is creditable
 towards total flying hours. Total flying hours must be in like crew position.
 7. Any qualified candidate may be trained using a cross-flow course for IQT/MQT at the
 gaining unit commander’s or appropriate AFRC/ANG supervisor’s discretion. Comply with
 course syllabus prerequisites.
 8. The prerequisites are defined by total flying time and C-130 time. For example, a C-130
 flight engineer upgrading to instructor would need 2000 total hours and 200 C-130 PAA hours
 or 400 PAA hours with any amount of total hours.
 9. For MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e., C-17, C-5, etc.), use TX2; MPD Phase II
 guide is not required. Pilots with dissimilar background (i.e., OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc.), use TX1;
 accomplish MPD Phase II guide in-unit.


5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). Mobility Pilot Development is the development
program leading to Aircraft Commander certification. The MPD program flows from Pilot
Initial Qualification (PIQ) or Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) formal training
courses through continuation training to upgrade selection and culminates in certification as an
Aircraft Commander. MPD continuation training is divided into three phases: MPD Phase I
(V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified
and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2C-130 Volume 2. MPD pilots are
not Aircraft Commanders. See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1.
   5.2.1. The success of this program depends on MPD pilots being mentored and provided
   with development opportunities. The upgrade training timeline to Aircraft Commander is
   based on performance and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, should be tailored to match an
   individual’s capabilities and experience level.
5.3. MPD Continuation Training thru Aircraft Commander Upgrade.
   5.3.1. Documentation. Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as
   V280 and V281 respectively; GRACC is documented in ARMS as V282. Document the
   completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and Sq/CC certification.
   5.3.2. Training Guides. MPD Phase I & II guides are available for download on the
   AMC/A3T CoP. Guides should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                   53


5.3.3. MPD Phase I (V280). After completion of the PIQ course, pilots enter Phase I of
continuation training. This first phase consists of completing the MPD Phase I guide, which
focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication, checklist discipline, systems
knowledge, and basic mission planning. A Phase I MPD should not have additional squadron
duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commander, yet they should observe and learn from
their aircrew leadership.
       5.3.3.1. During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the
       right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP. Phase I MPD pilots will
       train in the right seat during refresher sims and may occupy the left or right seats for
       proficiency sims (and available proficiency time at the end of a refresher sim). Phase I
       MPD pilots will complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180 days (365 days for ARC)
       after becoming mission ready.
       5.3.3.2. In order to advance beyond Phase I, the Phase I MPD pilot must be at least 6
       months from the training start date (as defined in 1.7.1), have a minimum of 200 PAA
       (aircraft) hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide. Once these requirements
       are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for Phase II via the STRP. (Note: MPD
       pilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI may continue under the
       previous GRACC workbook for up to 6 months beyond the release date of this AFI at
       Sq/CC discretion, but will comply with all other requirements in this paragraph). For
       FAIP/OSA or non-mobility weapon system pilots transitioning to MAF aircraft,
       completion of V280 is not required; however, V281 and V282 are required.
   5.3.4. MPD Phase II (V281). This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide,
   which focuses on the core tasks of flying skills, mission situational awareness, and crew
   management required for Aircraft Commander certification.
       5.3.4.1. Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats
       in the aircraft with an AC or above. Good judgment and Operational Risk Management
       (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy. As Phase II MPD
       pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management
       skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP. MPDs will not takeoff
       or land from the right seat when in formation. MPDs in the appropriate phase of the Pilot
       Development Guide may occupy the left seat on formation departures/ recoveries and
       assault or substandard airfield operations with an IP in the right seat.
       5.3.4.2. MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification. Phase II
       MPD pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD
       Phase II guide. Based upon performance, experience, and requisite flight hours, Phase II
       MPD pilots will be identified for upgrade by squadron leadership via the STRP. MPD
       pilots require a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready
       certification and prior to entry into Aircraft Commander upgrade (N/A for MAF
       crossflow, FAIP/OSA, or non- mobility weapon system pilots).
       5.3.4.3. AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC (V282). This event provides an in-depth
       look at selected AMC and 618 AOC (TACC) operations as well as an opportunity to
       interact with command senior staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by Aircraft
       Commander candidates after completing V281, but before beginning formal Aircraft
       Commander upgrade training (ACU or PCO). GRACC is mandatory for AMC pilots and
54                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


     highly encouraged for PACAF, USAFE, AFRC, and ANG mobility forces pilots
     upgrading to Aircraft Commander. GRACC is transferable between all mobility weapon
     systems. For AMC pilots, V282 will be completed prior to Aircraft Commander
     certification. If unable to complete V282 prior to certification, units may schedule
     attendance up to 90 days after certification; beyond 90 days requires OG/CC approval.
     See paragraph 1.18 for scheduling details. Additional information is available via
     ETCA: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.
  5.3.5. MPD Phase III. Aircraft Commander Upgrade (ACU) or Pilot Checkout (PCO).
  After the Sq/CC determines (via the STRP) an upgrade training start date, training time
  begins and the upgrade candidate will begin applicable ACU or PCO training events, as
  required (see Table 1.2 for in-unit training time limitations). Prior to starting training, the
  training office will open and maintain an AF Form 4022 until the upgrade candidate is
  certified as an Aircraft Commander. Units using multiple folders to document a pilots
  training progress may combine those into a single training folder at the unit’s discretion.
  Training guides are authorized.
     5.3.5.1. Current and qualified Aircraft Commander candidates accomplishing MPD
     Phase III training events require IP supervision during non-critical phases of flight and
     direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight. Two Aircraft Commander
     candidates may sit in the left and right seats under IP supervision in the simulator, as
     required.
     5.3.5.2. The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements
     prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board:
         5.3.5.2.1. In-Unit Upgrade. For MPD pilots, in-unit upgrade is the normal upgrade
         method. No waivers are required.
         5.3.5.2.2. Use approved ATS courseware.
         5.3.5.2.3. Aircraft Commander candidates must be current in applicable Mission
         Certification Training events listed in Table 3.1, prior to certification.
  5.3.6. Evaluation and Certification. Accomplish an Operational Mission Certification
  (OMC) according to AFI 11-2C-130 Volume 2, if required. ACU or PCO culminates with a
  Sq/CC’s R&C Board recommendation.
     5.3.6.1. Operational Mission Certification (OMC).             The Operational Mission
     Certification flight is intended to verify that Aircraft Commander Candidates possess the
     appropriate knowledge, decision making and flying skills (i.e. assault landings) required
     to operate within the worldwide mobility system. OMC profiles will be accomplished
     off-station and remain over night in conjunction with a JA/ATT, SAAM or locally
     generated off-station trainer. Additional requirements may be accomplished at the
     discretion of the OG/CC; however, they should reflect the unit’s mission.
     5.3.6.2. All MPD pilots and first-time C-130 Aircraft Commanders will accomplish an
     OMC to the satisfaction of an instructor prior to Aircraft Commander certification within
     the unit.
     5.3.6.3. If units can not comply with the off-station and over-night requirements, the
     OG/CC may approve an alternate scenario that meets the intent of the OMC.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                       55


        5.3.6.4. Items accomplished on a successful OMC may be counted toward requirements
        for the new crew position. See paragraph 4.4.1.
5.4. Pilot Designation Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes. Use the codes from

       recommending trainee for evaluation or certifying the student as qualified in a tactic or
       mission.
       5.5.6.4. Instructor Pilots. Instructor pilots shall be fully aware they are in command of
       the aircraft on training flights and are responsible at all times for flight conduct and
       aircraft safety. Should the trainee’s judgment or proficiency at the controls raise a
       question in the instructor’s mind as to the trainee’s ability to safely complete a prescribed
       maneuver at any time during the flight, the instructor will immediately assume aircraft
       control. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate proper tactics, techniques,
       and procedures for the maneuver prior to the trainee resuming control of the aircraft. All
       instructors will place special emphasis on procedures for positively identifying
       emergency conditions before initiating corrective action.

  5.7.1. Two-Ship Element Lead. This section prescribes the prerequisites, qualifications, and
  training requirements necessary for upgrade to two-ship element leader for aircraft
  commanders and navigators. This training program will provide aircrew members situational
  awareness and experience in preparation for formation lead upgrade. AWADS-capable units
  will normally accomplish two-ship element lead upgrade in conjunction with AWADS
  upgrade. Accomplish the upgrade training using the appropriate ATS courseware or locally
  produced training guide.
     5.7.1.1. Prerequisites. Commanders should select highly qualified mission ready aircraft
     commanders and navigators for two-ship element lead upgrade. Do not use flying hour
     totals alone as a measure of experience. Put significant weight on leadership abilities,
     knowledge of tactics, techniques, and procedures, ability to adapt to rapidly changing
     situations, and skill at operating in day visual, SKE, and NVG formations in the low-
     level, aerial delivery environment.
     5.7.1.2. Ground Training Requirements. Design two-ship element lead training to
     prepare an aircraft commander or navigator for the following responsibilities: two-ship
     formation and element lead, two-ship mission commander, application of C-130 tactics,
     techniques, and procedures, and combat mission planning and execution. See AFTTP 3-
     3.C-130 and/or AFI 11-2C-130v3
     5.7.1.3. Flying Training. The primary responsibility of a two-ship element leader is to
     lead two-ship formations and two-ship elements within a larger formation through a
     variety of situations to an objective. Place emphasis for in-flight training on wingman
     consideration, two-ship visual formation and element lead duties, SKE element lead
     duties, course and time control, communications, tactical formation maneuvering,
     formation departures and arrivals, and reaction to threats. As a minimum:
         5.7.1.3.1. Fly in the two-ship formation lead and element lead position for visual
         operations and fly in the element lead position for instrument (SKE) operations
         during airdrop missions. The instructor will ensure that the candidate has the
         opportunity to respond to a variety of in-flight changes such as threat avoidance,
         weather avoidance, and changing user requirements.
  5.7.2. Formation/Flight Lead.
     5.7.2.1. Prerequisites. Commanders should select highly qualified mission ready aircraft
     commanders and navigators for lead upgrade. Do not use flying hour totals alone as a
     measure of experience. Put more weight on leadership abilities, knowledge of tactics,
     techniques, and procedures, systems and procedural knowledge, ability to adapt to rapidly
     changing situations, and skill at operating in day visual, SKE, and NVG formations in the
     low-level, aerial delivery environment.
     5.7.2.2. Ground Training Requirements. Design lead training to prepare an aircraft
     commander or navigator for the following responsibilities: formation or flight lead,
     deputy flight lead, mission commander, and combat mission planning and execution.
     5.7.2.3. Flying Training. The primary responsibility of a formation lead is to lead the
     formation through a variety of situations to an objective. Place emphasis for in-flight
     training on course and time control, communications, formation requirements, wingman
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                59


       consideration, tactical formation maneuvering, formation departures and arrivals,
       adaptability to changing scenario, and reaction to threats. As a minimum:
          5.7.2.3.1. Fly in the formation lead position for both visual and instrument (SKE)
          operations during both airdrop and airland missions. The instructor will ensure that
          the candidate has the opportunity to respond to a variety of in-flight changes such as
          threat avoidance, weather avoidance, command-and-control directed-diverts,
          changing user requirements, loss of escort or drop zone support, and time slips. Use
          of all secure communications and electronic combat systems is essential in lead
          upgrade flying training. Emphasis should be on nuances of how to be a flight lead or
          element lead versus the number of run-ins.
5.8. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Training. NVGs are standard for night operations in the C-
130. Primary method for NVG training is during initial FTU qualification. This section outlines
the MAF NVG training programs for those crewmembers who did not receive NVG training at
the FTU during initial or requalification training. Units may complete NVG training in unit
without waivers using the MAF-approved syllabus located on the AMC/A3TA CoP.
   5.8.1. NVG Airdrop Certification. This training is designed for all crew positions to certify
   the crew to perform airdrop to overt and covert DZ's using NVGs. If accomplished in-unit,
   NVG airdrop training program may run concurrent with the MAF C-130 NVG airland, and
   unit indoctrination and vice-versa. See appropriate syllabus and AFTTP 3-3.C-130.
   5.8.2. NVG Airland Certification. This training is designed for all crew positions to certify
   the crew to land on overt or covert runways and conduct ground operations on blacked-out
   taxiways and ramps. Minimum required runway lighting is overt or covert, IAW AFI 13-217,
   Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations, or standard airfield lighting, to include
   expeditionary airfield lighting systems (EALS). If accomplished in-unit, NVG airland
   training program may run concurrent with the MAF C-130 NVG airdrop and unit
   indoctrination and vice-versa. See appropriate syllabus and AFTTP 3-3.C-130.
   5.8.3. NVG Assault Certification. This program is designed to certify the pilot, copilot,
   navigator, and engineer crew positions in C-130 NVG assault operations. NVG airland-
   certified loadmasters are considered NVG assault certified and do not require this training.
   Minimum required LZ lighting is overt or covert, IAW AFI 13-217 or standard airfield
   lighting, to include EALS. C-130 NVG Airland certification is a prerequisite to C-130 NVG
   Assault training. The MAF NVG Airdrop Training program may run concurrently with this
   training program and unit indoctrination. See appropriate syllabus and AFTTP 3-3.C-130.
   5.8.4. NVG Formation Takeoff and Landing. Formation qualified crewmembers who are
   certified in NVG Airland are certified for NVG formation takeoffs and landings.
5.9. Phoenix Banner Certification. Units will certify aircrew members for Phoenix Banner
missions IAW AFI 11-289, Phoenix Banner, Silver, and Copper Operations.
5.10. Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) Certification.
   5.10.1. The JPADS training program is designed for all crew positions. This program allows
   MAF combat delivery aircrews to improve airdrop accuracy during high altitude airdrop
   employment utilizing the PADS mission planner and JPADS. Improved CDS (I-CDS) and
   JPADS operations are conducted using the UHF Dropsonde Receiver, GPS-retransmission
 60                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


   link equipment and PADS Mission Planner (PADS-MP) laptop and CAT PADS software. I-
   CDS operations use standard-rigged CDS loads with non-steerable chutes; JPADS operations
   are conducted using steerable chutes with Airborne Guidance Units (AGU). For both types of
   airdrop, the PADS MP laptop will be used to determine a more precise airdrop release point
   or launch acceptability region (LAR). Crews will comply with all requirements of AFI 13-
   217.
   5.10.2. JPADS Airdrop: This training is designed to allow single/multiple ship I-CDS or
   JPADS operations using low, medium, or high altitude procedures. JPADS airdrop training
   is accomplished with the PADS mission planner and either normal ballistic loads or JPADS-
   guided loads depending on availability. When ballistic loads (i.e., I-CDS) are used in lieu of
   JPADS guided loads, an in-flight wireless update will be completed to a static AGU for
   training prior to the drop.
   5.10.3. I-CDS and JPADS certification and currency. I-CDS and JPADS certification will
   be completed in accordance with the JPADS training syllabus and guide. For JPADS
   operations, C-130H are considered the same MDS. Crewmembers who previously
   completed the interim JPADS training syllabus are considered JPADS certified. All
   crewmembers will complete Phase I training. Phase I Pilots and Flight Engineers will
   receive a JPADS certification, but will not require any continuation training. In addition,
   crewmembers performing PADS Operator (PO) or loadmaster (LM) duties will complete
   Phase II qualification training, and require continuation training. All navigators entered into
   JPADS training will complete Phase II training and be PO certified. Pilots may also
   complete Phase II training and be certified as PADS operators. PO certification includes I-
   CDS and JPADS drop operations. All simulated events must be verbally debriefed. For
   example, if a unit has Dropsondes but no AGU, consider the PO syllabus Wireless Transfer
   Event complete if the student imports Dropsonde data and simulates Wireless AGU Data
   Transfer. LM certification is split into I-CDS (Phase I) and JPADS operations (Phase II).
   LM’s that do not complete hands-on AGU training will be certified as Phase I only until
   JPADS Phase II training is complete.
   5.10.4. Upon completion of applicable training, crewmembers are considered JPADS/I-CDS
   certified or I-CDS-only certified as described in paragraph 5.9.3. Units may document
   Phase I training on AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report, for
   non-PO pilots and flight engineers. Use ARMS event identifiers Q502 ―JPADS/I-CDS
   certification‖ for non-PO certified pilots and flight engineers, Q521 ―JPADS Phase I‖ for I-
   CDS/non-guided certified loadmasters, and Q522 ―JPADS Phase II‖ for PADS Operator
   certified crewmembers and JPADS certified loadmasters.
   5.10.5. The PADS Operator (PO) is defined as any JPADS Phase II certified rated officer.
   Normally this consists of the navigator or an additional pilot, but may also be a PADS
   Operator from another airframe (e.g., C-130J, C-17). For the purposes of non-current PADS
   Operators who need an instructor, like specialty is not required (e.g., a pilot PADS Operator
   may instruct a navigator PADS Operator on events AD11 or AD12).
5.11. Unimproved Landing Certification. Pilots will be trained and certified by an instructor
on unimproved airfields using assault procedures. Unimproved airfields are airfields where
runway acquisition and ground operations are complicated by blowing snow, sand, or dirt;
undulating terrain, or minimum runway lighting or markings. Only affects MR status for
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                    61


missions requiring unimproved field landings. Units will record and track this training using
Q542.
5.12. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Certification. AFI 11-2C-130v3, outlines FCF
requirements. FCF pilots and flight engineers will be selected from highly qualified instructors.
The candidate will complete a review of applicable technical orders. The pilot candidate will fly
in the copilot position on a minimum of one FCF prior to unit commander certification.
5.13. Touch and Go Landing Certification. MPD pilots receive touch and go training and
certification as part of initial qualification at the FTU. See AFI11-2C-130v3 for touch-and-go
landing limitations.
   5.13.1. Aircraft commanders may be touch-and-go certified after completion of the aircraft
   commander initial qualification evaluation, having successfully demonstrated a touch-and-go
   as part of the landing criteria described in AFI 11-2C-130v2. Aircraft commanders will not
   fly touch-and-go landings until certified for the event by the Sq/CC.
       5.13.1.1. Training includes accomplishment of their own flight-idle touch-and-go
       landings and supervising the other pilot’s flight-idle touch-and-go landings.
   5.13.2. NVG Touch and Go Landing Certification.
       5.13.2.1. Sq/CC may certify a touch-and-go certified aircraft commander for NVG
       touch-and-go landings after completion of NVG Airland training.
5.14. Medium and High Altitude Aerial Delivery Certification. See paragraph 7.4.1 and
Attachment 1 for altitude definitions. Navigators will accomplish high-altitude airdrop using a
high-altitude release point (HARP) or computed air release point (CARP) depending on the type
airdrop accomplished. HARP airdrops require special certification. Navigators will accomplish
the first HARP airdrop under the direct supervision of a high-altitude certified instructor. Use the
ATS courseware for this training. CARP airdrops at high altitude do not require special
certification. High altitude airdrops may be credited as the appropriate type of airdrop (i.e.,
HALO or HAHO personnel count as a personnel airdrop). During continuation training,
crewmembers may simulate the actual airdrop but will comply with all procedures in AFTTP 3-
3.C-130 and/or AFI 11-2C-130v3. There is no certification required for other crewmembers.
5.15. Grid Navigation Certification. If required due to aircraft equipment or unit mission, this
section outlines the certification and continuation training requirements for a navigator to be
qualified to fly above 65 degrees north or below 70 degrees south.
   5.15.1. Prerequisites. Navigators will be basic aircraft qualified to begin grid training.
   5.15.2. Certification Training. Accomplish ground and flying training according to ATS
   courseware. A minimum of one flight will be accomplished in the aircraft. Certification is
   IAW AFI 11-2C-130v2.
   5.15.3. Flying Continuation Training. Accomplish according to Table 4.4.
   5.15.4. Grid profile (day or night). This event uses a grid reference system for aircraft
   steering and should continue for at least a 2-hour period. Instructor navigators may credit a
   grid event on a category I or II route. Grid profiles may also be logged as a navigational
   profile if requirements are met.

5.16. Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS). The MAFFS mission is a joint
mission performed by ANG, AFRC, and US Forest Service (USFS) personnel as a partnership
with USFS as the lead federal agency. The term MAFFS is used as a generic term which
includes both MAFFS (legacy) and MAFFS II. This section establishes the continuation training
requirements for a MAFFS-certified C-130 crewmember.            In addition, MAFFS Instructor
certification guidance is included. OG/CCs of MAFFS units may provide additional guidance or
clarification in local training procedures. MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) approval is required if
changing policy or guidance in paragraph 5.16 or its subparagraphs.
   5.16.1. Requirements.
       5.16.1.1. MAFFS syllabus changes and updates will be prepared by any MAJCOM/A3T
       (or equivalent) designated MAFFS unit and forwarded to NGB/A3O and AFRC/A3T for
       coordination. NGB/A3O and AFRC/A3T will coordinate on the MAFFS syllabus.
       NGB/A3O will maintain the master files and approve syllabus changes and updates upon
       receipt of coordination from AFRC/A3T. Final syllabus approval is NGB/A3 and
       AFRC/A3 with informational copies sent to AMC/A3T.
       5.16.1.2. Conduct MAFFS Certification for pilots, navigators, flight engineers, and
       loadmasters IAW the approved training syllabus. Upon completion of training, as
       detailed in this instruction and the syllabus, crewmembers will be certified for MAFFS
       missions. Flight evaluations are not required to certify MAFFS aircrew.
   5.16.2. Approval/Waiver for MAFFS Certification. The MAFFS unit’s Sq/CC, through the
   squadron TRP is the approval authority for MAFFS Certification. The MAFFS unit’s OG/CC
   is the waiver authority for MAFFS aircrew continuation training requirements.
   5.16.3. Time Period for Mission Certification Training. There is no specified training time
   limit due to the availability of the MAFFS training program conducted by the US Forest
   Service (USFS).
   5.16.4. MAFFS Training Prerequisites. For all crew positions, the crewmembers will be
   highly qualified C-130 Mission Ready crewmembers who are airdrop qualified. Pilots and
   Navigators will be formation and visual low level qualified. Crewmembers must have the
   availability to complete the required training and respond to mission tasking during the
   wildfire season. Aircrew will be designated by the OG/CC for course entry.
   5.16.5. MAFFS Initial Training. Accomplish ground and flight training under the
   supervision of a MAFFS instructor. All training will be conducted IAW the approved
   MAFFS Syllabus and training guides during the training session in coordination with the
   USFS, at a location determined by the USFS. A flight evaluation is not required. Upon
   successful completion of all required training items, instructors will nominate the
   crewmember for certification. Once certified, crewmembers will be allowed to perform
   MAFFS mission duties in their crew position.
       5.16.5.1. Instructors. MAFFS instructor candidates will be selected from among the most
       qualified instructors and will be experienced in all phases of MAFFS flying operations,
       including actual wild fire airdrops. Prior to certifying instructors to teach MAFFS, they
       will receive training that will include ground and flight certification requirements under
       the supervision of a MAFFS instructor. OG/CCs should provide additional guidance and
       specific requirements for instructor certification.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                    63


  5.16.6. Continuation Training. This section outlines ground and flying continuation training
  requirements for MAFFS-certified pilots and loadmasters. MAFFS continuation training will
  be accomplished during an annually scheduled training session conducted by the individual
  operational MAFFS unit or in coordination with USFS at their biennially provided training
  event. If a crewmember does not attend a training session, they are considered non-current
  and may regain currency on an actual fire under the direct supervision of a MAFFS
  instructor. If a crewmember loses airdrop qualification, they will also lose MAFFS
  certification until qualification is regained. In addition, if pilots or navigators lose formation
  or visual low level qualification, they will also lose MAFFS certification until qualification is
  regained.
     5.16.6.1. USFS Certification. A MAFFS Instructor will supervise all MAFFS ground and
     flying continuation training. MAFFS Sq/CCs or OG/CCs will certify individual
     crewmember qualifications to the USFS upon successful completion of all required
     training items.
     5.16.6.2. Continuation Training Requirements. MAFFS currency duration shall be based
     on the annual MAFFS training program. Due to the frequently changing available
     training opportunities throughout the training year, ARMS is not ideally suited to track
     ground or flying continuation training events. Units may develop X coded events for
     these purposes, but it is not required. Training accomplishment will be documented IAW
     paragraph 5.15.6.1.
     5.16.6.3. Ground Training. Accomplish ground training IAW Table 5.3.
     5.16.6.4. Flight Training. Accomplish annual flying training IAW Table 5.4.
     5.16.6.5. MAFFS Training is a one-time event for navigators and flight engineers. These
     crew positions have no MAFFS continuation training or currency requirements, but it is
     recommended that they attend ground training sessions to the maximum extent possible.

   Chapter 5 and will be considered aerial spray instructor certified without any further training
   or evaluation. Aircraft commanders who are highly experience aerial spray certified copilots
   and MPD pilots will upgrade to aerial spray aircraft commander according to Chapter 5 and
   upon completion of ASCT syllabus.
   5.17.9. Aerial Spray Orientation Flying Program. Any mission ready crewmember selected
   for initial or recertification training for aerial spray may participate in the aerial spray
   orientation program. This is an optional program that allows an individual to fly with their
   respective crew position in order to observe aircrew preflight and in-flight duties and log
   other time. An instructor will accompany each individual. The individual’s supervisor may
   approve more than one flight. Participation in the aerial spray orientation program will be
   terminated upon entry into initial or recertification training.
5.18. LC-130 Ski Mission Qualification Training. Ski Mission training will qualify and
maintain aircrew qualification for LC-130 Ski Mission polar operations in the Arctic and
Antarctic.   This section establishes the minimum training requirements for LC-130
crewmembers. OG/CCs of Ski units may provide additional guidance or clarification in local
training procedures (MAJCOM approval is required if changing policy or guidance in
paragraph 5.18 or its subparagraphs).
   5.18.1. General.
        5.18.1.1. The 109 AW, Stratton ANGB, NY has sole responsibility for LC-130 Ski
        Mission operations within the Department of Defense and is the FTU for the Ski Mission
        and Celestial and Grid Navigation Training. Training folder reviews for these courses
        will be IAW paragraph A2.3.7.2.
        5.18.1.2. Waiver Authority. The 109 OG/CC is the waiver authority for Ski Mission
        ground and flying continuation training requirements IAW paragraph 1.5.
        5.18.1.3. Ski Mission syllabi development, changes, and updates will be prepared by 109
        OSF/OST for NGB/A3O approval. NGB/A3O will maintain the master files IAW
        paragraph 1.4.
           5.18.1.3.1. Operations Group. 109 OG/CC, through the TRP, is the approval
           authority for Ski Mission upgrade.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                  69


     5.18.1.4. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. There are no specified LC-130 difference
     time limitations due to limited availability of LC-130s at home station during the unit's
     annual 5-month deployment to Antarctica. There are no specified Ski Mission
     qualification time limitations due to the seasonal nature of the Ski Mission and
     availability of crewmembers to go OCONUS.             Ski Mission flying training and
     operational flying is accomplished OCONUS only.
     5.18.1.5. LC-130 upgrade training will be conducted IAW this chapter and 109 AW
     courseware. It is preferred for 109 AW Ski Mission pilots and navigators to complete
     operational mission qualification before entering special mission (e.g. polar airdrop or
     tactical) qualification or upgrade training. Exceptions require 109 OG/CC or 109
     AW/AOO approval. Flight engineers and loadmasters may complete special training in
     conjunction with operational mission qualification.
  5.18.2. Initial Qualification Training (Phase I)
     5.18.2.1. General Requirements.          This section establishes minimum training
     requirements to qualify as an LC-130 crewmember. Crewmembers will complete C-130
     initial qualification ground training requirements IAW paragraph 2.3 of this instruction.
     All newly assigned crewmembers will complete LL01 Aircrew Flight Equipment
     Familiarization Training and SS01 Local Area Survival prior to their first flight and G002
     Aircraft Marshalling Training and Examination IAW Chapter 7.
     5.18.2.2. Local 109 AW Initial Qualification Training. All 109 AW crewmembers will
     complete training per this AFI and local training procedures.
         5.18.2.2.1. 109 AW pilots and navigators normally complete C-130 FTU Phase 1 and
         Phase 2 (single ship, visual, low-level airdrop) training. If Phase 2 is not
         accomplished at the FTU, pilots will complete assault training and polar airdrop
         training by secondary method. Aircrew completing airdrop training at the FTU will
         complete a local familiarization program emphasizing polar airdrop differences to
         complete polar airdrop certification. Due to the nature of the Ski Mission, 109 AW
         Ski Mission navigators are not required to perform ARAs (N120). 109 AW Ski
         Mission navigators will be trained and evaluated for Ski ARAs (XC30).
     5.18.2.3. Difference Training. All Difference Training will be completed IAW 109 AW
     courseware.
         5.18.2.3.1. 109 AW Pilot C-130H2 Difference Training. An instructor pilot will sign
         off the student after completion of the syllabus. Crewmembers completing initial C-
         130H2 qualification training at the FTU will only require local area familiarization.
         If initial C-130H2 flying training is accomplished in-unit, C-130H2 and LC-130
         Difference Training may be accomplished concurrently.
         5.18.2.3.2. 109 AW Pilot C-130H2 to LC-130 Difference Training. Pilots will
         complete a local academic LC-130 difference ground training course. Simulator
         training will be accomplished prior to the LC-130 difference flight evaluation. LC-
         130 flying training is designed to obtain proficiency in the operation of the aircraft on
         normal, hard surface runways. Accomplish LC-130 Difference Training in the L-1
         (LC-130H2), L-1A (LC-130H2.5) and L-2 (LC-130H3) aircraft. It is recommended
         that approximately half of the flights (minimum of two) are flown in each respective
70                                                        AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


         model (L-1 and L-1A are treated as same model). Pilots require satisfactory
         completion of a written difference examination, difference Emergency Procedure
         Evaluation (EPE) and a difference SPOT flight evaluation. If initial C-130H2 flying
         training is accomplished in-unit, C-130H2 and LC-130 Difference Training may be
         accomplished concurrently.         Note: Because of the unpredictable and limited
         availability of specific model LC aircraft during the unit’s annual Antarctic
         deployment, it is allowable for pilots to complete LC-130 Difference Training in
         either the L-1 and L-1A or the L-2 aircraft; in this case, after successful completion of
         the difference SPOT flight evaluation, pilots will fly supervised in the other LC-130
         model until the two-sortie minimum is completed with all syllabus maneuvers
         performed to the satisfaction of an instructor pilot. No additional difference
         evaluation is required; the IP sign-off will certify completion of the remaining
         difference training requirements. These sorties will be documented in the LC-130
         Difference Training grade folder.
         5.18.2.3.3. 109 AW Navigator/Flight Engineer/Loadmaster Difference Training. An
         Instructor of the same crew position will sign off the student after completion of the
         syllabus. Crewmembers will complete a local 109 AW academic difference ground
         training course and flying syllabus. If initial C-130H2 flying training is accomplished
         in-unit, C-130H2 and LC-130 differences training may be accomplished concurrently.
  5.18.3. Mission Qualification Training (Phase II)
     5.18.3.1. Ski Mission Ground Training Requirements. Crewmembers will accomplish
     ground training under the supervision of a qualified instructor of the same crew position.
     All training will be conducted IAW approved Ski Mission syllabi, training guides, and
     109 AW instructions.
         5.18.3.1.1. 109 AW flight crew are required to complete initial ski combat offload
         training, initial buddy air start training, initial assisted takeoff training, and initial
         remote fueling training. Continuation training of these requirements is accomplished
         during Ski Tactics (G060S).
             5.18.3.1.1.1. 109 AW Remote Fueling Training consists of three phases as
             specified in 109 AW courseware. All flight crew will complete Phase I and Phase
             II training. Flight engineers, loadmasters, and navigators complete Phase III.
             Successful completion of mission qualification certifies completion of training.
             5.18.3.1.1.2. 109 AW Assisted Take Off (ATO) training consists of three phases
             as specified in 109 AW courseware. Unsupervised ATO operations will not be
             conducted until completion of this training. All crewmembers will complete
             Phase I training. Aircraft commander, flight engineer, and loadmaster upgrades
             will complete Phase II. Aircraft commander and flight engineer upgrades
             complete Phase III training, which consists of actual or simulated ATO firing.
             The preferred method for completion of Phase III training for aircraft commander
             and flight engineer upgrades is for the student to perform an actual firing of ATO
             during mission qualification training. However, due to the cost and dwindling
             supply of ATO, 109 OSF/OST has created ATO simulation training that fulfills
             this requirement if circumstances preclude actual ATO firing during training.
             Successful completion of mission qualification certifies completion of this
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                               71


            training.
        5.18.3.1.2. Theater Indoctrination Training. 109 OSF/OST will maintain theater
        indoctrination training materials to ensure aircrews are trained for specific theater
        flight operations in Antarctica and Greenland.
        5.18.3.1.3. 109 AW Flight Crew will complete CBRNE Defense Training (G010),
        Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (LL04), and Aircrew Chemical Defense Task
        Qualification Training (P280) in accordance with Chapter 7 and Table 2.1 of this
        AFI.
     5.18.3.2. Ski Mission Flying Training Requirements: Ski Mission flight training is
     completed in Greenland or Antarctica; mission considerations make Greenland preferable
     for training. All Ski Mission training will be conducted IAW approved Ski Mission
     syllabi, training guides, and instructions. Crewmembers will accomplish flight training
     under the supervision of a Ski Mission Instructor of the same position. Crewmembers
     will normally complete Ski Mission qualification, initial Ski Combat Offload training,
     initial Assisted Takeoff training, and initial Remote Fueling training simultaneously.
     Grid and Celestial navigation mission qualification (navigators) may also be completed
     concurrently with Ski Mission training. Upon successful completion of all required
     training items, instructors will recommend the crewmember for a Ski Mission evaluation.
        5.18.3.2.1. 109 AW Ski Mission Pilots and MPDs: All pilots will initially qualify as
        Ski Mission Copilots. Prerequisites for initial Ski Mission evaluation are a Ski EPE,
        a C-130H2 FTU (or secondary method) qualification or difference IP sign-off, a LC-
        130 difference flight evaluation, and an assault flight evaluation (FTU evaluation
        meets this requirement). Unless accomplished in the simulator IAW the LC-130 Ski
        Mission Copilot Syllabus, a minimum of two ARA approaches will be accomplished
        in weather conditions of 1,000 foot ceiling and 3 miles visibility or lower to complete
        Ski Mission qualification.
            5.18.3.2.1.1. Ski Mission copilot candidates are not required to perform pilot
            flying duties for ski landings or ski takeoffs, but will demonstrate proficiency in
            Ski Mission Copilot (pilot monitoring) duties and will complete a Ski Copilot
            Mission evaluation.
            5.18.3.2.1.2. Candidates qualifying for Ski Mission Aircraft Commander will
            receive instruction while performing pilot flying duties in the left seat and will
            complete a Ski Aircraft Commander Mission evaluation in the left seat.
        5.18.3.2.2. 109 AW Ski Mission Navigators: Normally, conduct flight training in
        conjunction with Ski Missions. Ski ARAs (XC30) for 109 AW navigators are a
        mission requirement and will be evaluated accordingly. Accomplish a minimum of
        10 Ski ARAs prior to receiving an initial Ski Mission flight evaluation. A
        qualification evaluation on Grid and Celestial navigation procedures will be
        accomplished prior to an initial Ski Mission evaluation.
            5.18.3.2.2.1. Celestial Navigation Qualification Training. Accomplish ground
            and flying training according to 109 AW courseware. Complete Celestial
            navigation ground training prior to mission qualification training. A minimum of
            two Celestial sorties will be flown prior to qualification. One of these training
72                                                      AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


            legs may be accomplished on a Celestial Training Device.
            5.18.3.2.2.2. Grid Navigation Qualification Training. Accomplish ground and
            flying training according to 109 AW courseware. Complete Grid navigation
            ground training prior to mission qualification training. A minimum of one flight
            using Grid navigation procedures will be accomplished in the aircraft.
        5.18.3.2.3. 109 AW Ski Mission Flight Engineers: Complete flight training in
        conjunction with Ski Missions and according to 109AW courseware to include actual
        ski takeoff and landing operations.
        5.18.3.2.4. 109 AW Ski Mission Loadmasters: Complete flight training in
        conjunction with Ski Missions and according to 109 AW courseware to include a
        demonstration directing on/off loading operations on a snow surface with the aircraft
        on skis.
        5.18.3.2.5. 109 AW Ski Mission Instructors/Evaluators. Ski Mission Instructor Pilot
        candidates will be selected from among qualified instructor/evaluator pilots and will
        be experienced in all phases of Ski Mission operations. Prior to certifying
        instructor/evaluator pilots in the Ski Mission, instructor and evaluator candidates will
        receive training that includes ground and flight qualification requirements. Ground
        training will emphasize emergency procedures, hazards of polar flying, required crew
        coordination, and CRM and ORM principles. All other crew positions may be
        certified as Ski Mission Instructors/Evaluators following initial Instructor/Evaluator
        qualification.
        5.18.3.2.6. Polar Airdrop. 109 AW flight crewmembers will be selected through the
        TRP process for Polar Airdrop training. In-unit training will be IAW formal school
        and 109 AW courseware. New 109 AW pilots and navigators currently airdrop
        qualified require one day and one night local orientation flight as a minimum prior to
        instructor sign-off.
     5.18.3.3. Tactical Mission Qualification Training. When not completed at the FTU,
     tactical training normally begins after Ski Mission Qualification Training for selected 109
     AW pilots and navigators. 109 AW flight crewmembers will be selected through the TRP
     process for tactical training which includes day and NVG single-ship, visual low-level
     CDS airdrop. In-unit ground and flying training will be via secondary method IAW
     formal school and 109 AW courseware. Newly assigned 109 AW pilots and navigators
     who are day and NVG single-ship, visual low-level airdrop qualified require one day
     visual low-level orientation flight to an airdrop and one NVG visual low-level sortie to an
     NVG airdrop as a minimum prior to instructor sign-off.
     5.18.3.4. Assault Qualification Training: When not completed at the FTU, assault
     training begins after C-130H2 Difference Training. Assault qualified, newly assigned
     109 AW pilots require a minimum of one day and one night local orientation flight in a
     C-130H2 aircraft, with an IP sign off, prior to aircraft commander certification. Pilots
     require an assault flight evaluation, if not already qualified, prior to aircraft commander
     certification.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                              73


  5.18.4. Continuation Training. This section outlines continuation ground and flying training
  requirements for Ski Mission qualified crewmembers. 109 OSF/OST maintains definitions
  of all ―X‖ events and ―S‖ suffix courses listed in Tables 5.7, 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10.
     5.18.4.1. Flying and ground training events for the 109 AW will be tracked in the ARMS
     database IAW Tables 5.7, 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10. OG/CC may publish in local training
     procedures any MAJCOM-approved changes to these tables.
     5.18.4.2. Ski Mission qualified crewmembers of the 109 AW will maintain the
     requirements of Tables 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, and 5.10 with the exception of Tactical Events.
     5.18.4.3. Tactical qualified crewmembers of the 109 AW will maintain all requirements
     of Tables 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, and 5.10 Failure to complete Tactical ground or flying training
     requirements does not impact MR status for the Ski Mission.
     5.18.4.4. Ski Mission items cannot be credited in the simulator. For other events see
     paragraph 4.5.3.2 (referencing Tables 5.9 and 5.10) for crediting events in a simulator.
     5.18.4.5. Grid Profile. This event uses a Grid reference system for aircraft steering and
     should continue for at least a 2-hour period. Navigators may credit a Grid event on a
     Category I or II route. Grid profiles may also be logged as a navigational profile if
     requirements are met.
     5.18.4.6. Due to the Antarctic season, 109 AW training year is defined as follows:
         5.18.4.6.1. Flying and Ground Training Annual Period: 1 Apr – 31 Mar
         5.18.4.6.2. Flying Semi-Annual Training Periods: 1 Apr – 30 Sep and 1 Oct – 31
         Mar.
     5.18.4.7. Multiple Qualifications. C-130H2 and LC-130s only require initial Difference
     Training (no difference currency).
     5.18.4.8. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.
         5.18.4.8.1. Comply with restrictions and requirements described in paragraph 4.9.3
         by referencing LC-130 events listed in Tables 5.7 (for Table 4.1 references) and
         Table 5.8 for (Table 4.2 references).
         5.18.4.8.2. OG/CC waivers for events in Tables 5.7 and 5.8 will comply with
         paragraph 4.9.3.4.
     5.18.4.9. Crewmembers NMR for Flying Training Events.
         5.18.4.9.1. NMR crewmembers will comply with restrictions and requirements
         described in paragraph 4.9.4 by referencing LC-130 events listed in Tables 5.9 and
         5.10.
         5.18.4.9.2. NMR for Ski Mission events does not affect other missions. Overdue
         flying training requirements in Tactical, Polar Airdrop, NVG or Assault requirements
         do not restrict crewmembers from flying the Ski Mission. Conversely, due to the
         seasonal nature of the Ski Mission, overdue flying training requirements in the Ski
         Mission do not restrict crewmembers from flying other missions and do not restrict
         crewmembers from going OCONUS. Ski Mission flying can only be accomplished
         OCONUS.

5.19. ILS Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) Certification Training.
   5.19.1. AFI 11-202 Volume 3 requires aircrews operating aircraft equipped with dual VHF
   radios and TCAS to receive one-time training for operations at airports with ILS PRM
   approaches. The Sq/CC or designated representative will certify pilots upon completion of
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                              81


   one-time training. Document certification as ILS PRM-Certified, ARMS event identifier is
   Q017, ILS PRM. Before operations at an airport with ILS PRM approaches capabilities,
   pilots will complete the following training and certification. See AFI 11-2C-130v3 for more
   information.
   5.19.2. Training Program. Review ILS PRM requirements according to the Airman's
   Information Manual, Part 5-4-15. Complete appropriate training including viewing of the
   video.     The      most     current    information      can      be     viewed      at:
   http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/prm.
   5.19.3. View FAA video, "ILS PRM Approach Information for Air Carrier Pilots" available
   for down load. The large-file video is also available on the AMC/A3T CoP at:
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AM-81.
5.20. Low Cost/Low Altitude (LCLA) Certification.
   5.20.1. The LCLA training program is designed for all crew positions. This program
   certifies MAF combat delivery aircrews to conduct DZ operations using LCLA airdrop
   procedures. During training, crews will comply with CDS drop zone size requirements in
   AFI 13-217.
   5.20.2. Training Program. AATTC at St. Joseph, MO, is the MAF LCLA training lead.
   Units tasked to deploy LCLA-trained crews will schedule a Mobile Training Team (MTT)
   through AATTC to establish an initial cadre. If an MTT cannot be scheduled prior to
   deployment, OG/CCs will select highly experienced instructors from each crew position to
   serve as the unit’s initial cadre. OG/CCs will gain approval from MAJCOM/A3T (or
   equivalent) IAW waiver procedures outlined in paragraph 1.5 when exercising the non-MTT
   training option. The selected individuals will complete a thorough review of all available
   LCLA guidance and perform all events listed in paragraph 7. 4 (with no events waived).
   Once certified, unit initial cadre will train remaining unit crewmembers.
      5.20.2.1. Prior Trained Crewmembers. Units with previously trained crewmembers
      (trained at AATTC, by a MTT, or utilizing the exception in paragraph 5.19.2) may be
      certified without any additional training. Crewmembers who are already instructor
      certified and LCLA certified may be used to train additional crewmembers.
   5.20.3. Certification. LCLA is one-time training for all crew positions. Units may document
   training on AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report, upon
   completion. Units will certify crewmembers and track in ARMS using code Q517 ―Low
   Cost/Low Altitude (LCLA) Certification‖. Semi-annual continuation training for LCLA
   airdrop is not required, but units will refresh crews on LCLA operations prior to AOR
   deployment. Log LCLA drops as AD04 (CDS Airdrop).

                                           Chapter 6

                          AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. The C-130 ATS is a contractor-provided aircrew training system. The ATS
contractor provides academic and simulator training. The Air Force conducts all flight training
and administers all evaluations. The ATS contract guarantees trained students meet government
standards.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202v1.
   6.2.1. Purpose: C-130 ATS is a system of academics, Aircrew Training Device (ATD)
   sessions, and ground and flight training phases. This system provides qualification, upgrade,
   and continuation training to attain and maintain appropriate qualification for C-130
   crewmembers and maintenance engine run technicians. The ATS contractor provides
   training courseware and all academic and ATD instruction. US Air Force provides all flight
   instruction.
   6.2.2. Goal. The goal of the ATS program is to optimize aircrew training through the
   integrated use of academics, ATD, and flightline C-130 aircraft instruction.           These
   objectives should be included within the statement of work for such support as well as means
   for evaluation and approval of course content, standards, and media.
6.3. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202v1.
   6.3.1. Applies to formal school and continuation training. It is imperative that students
   complete training in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Students will enroll on a full-time
   basis. Relieve students of duties not directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Senior
   Officer Course (SOC) students may continue their normal duties as time permits.
6.4. ATS Course Prerequisites. ATS course prerequisites are listed in Table 5.1 and the
appropriate syllabus. Each ATS course is designed and based on student prerequisites being met.
Prerequisites may include, but are not limited to, a minimum number of flying hours, squadron
operations officer recommendation, and completion of applicable courseware.
6.5. Lesson Objectives: Instructors and evaluators use lesson objectives as a reference
document to establish training and evaluation standards.
   6.5.1. Master Task List (MTL) and Standards of Evaluation (SOE) Purpose: MTL and SOE
   provide the basis for ATS courseware development, and are a principle source for evaluation
   criteria (validate C-130 crewmember performance).
       6.5.1.1. Courseware developers, flight examiners, and instructors who train C-130
       crewmembers should use criteria in these documents to help determine the ability of an
       individual to meet performance levels required to be mission-qualified. For evaluation,
       use AFI 11-2C-130v2 criteria.
       6.5.1.2. Conduct the Air Force evaluation to SOE standards, in a timely manner
       subsequent to the trainee’s completion of the ground-based or flight training (to guarantee
       standards).
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                  83


   6.5.2. The ATS contractor provides opportunities for Air Force flight instructors to observe
   trainee progress in ATDs. Likewise, ATS instructors may observe the trainee’s aircraft
   flights. In some cases, ATS courseware may state these specific occurrences. Every
   reasonable effort should be made to ensure this type of interface continues at each main
   operating base (MOB).
   6.5.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM) training. CRM trains crewmembers to cope with
   potential problems in human behavior affecting crew performance. CRM is presented on a
   recurring basis throughout the C-130 ATS. Introduction to CRM is presented during initial
   qualification training (IQT) and is imbedded in recurring phase training.
6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. If a student's training progress is unsatisfactory, the
contractor (per the contract) will notify the government representative (wing training, operations
officer, etc). Following review of the student's record, the government representative will
determine whether to continue or terminate training. See formal course syllabus or MAJCOM
policy for further guidance.
6.6.1. The contractor will provide written feedback to the training unit commander for students
who display substandard performance.
   6.6.2. Remediation Procedures. Notify ATS contractor and COR within 24 hours of a failed
   flight evaluation following an ATS course. Remediation subsequent to a failed flight
   evaluation may be the ATS contractor’s responsibility, Air Force’s responsibility, or a joint
   responsibility, depending on the nature of failure. In every case, close coordination is
   required to achieve maximum trainee progress. Direct contact with appropriate ATS
   instructor supervisor is encouraged.
       6.6.2.1. Remediation Scheduling:
           6.6.2.1.1. When a trainee is required to return for remediation regarding deficient
           areas, the trainee’s unit, appropriate wing or group training office, and ATS training
           manager will coordinate training start and completion dates.
           6.6.2.1.2. The ATS contractor will notify the government (per the contract) when
           identifying a trainee who requires remediation or additional training. Air Force will
           review ATS contractor documentation and recommendations regarding trainee
           performance. Air Force will determine whether or not to continue any further
           training for that trainee, using ATS instruction, or otherwise terminate all training.
6.7. Courseware Changes. Changes to ATS courseware, including MTL and SOE, may be
proposed by any C-130 crewmember. Complete recommended change on ATS contractor’s
change proposal form and submit to the local PO/COR. Change proposals will be sent through
wing or group training and ATS PO/COR offices to 714 TRS at Little Rock AFB. The 714 TRS
will coordinate with the ATS contractor and the originator and will provide feedback to reflect
action taken. Change proposal forms are available from the ATS contractor training manager at
each site.
6.8. Scheduling:
   6.8.1. General. Local procedures will be developed at each main operating base (MOB) for
   scheduling ATS trainees. MOB wing or group training offices will ensure procedures
   minimize schedule changes and turbulence.
84                                                      AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


  6.8.2. Enrollment. Enrollment for all ATS courses (upgrade and continuation) will be
  accomplished through the wing or group training office (appropriate ARC chain-of-command
  for ARC upgrades). Names and other personal data required by ATS contractor will be
  passed to the ATS scheduler not later than the time established by host wing or group
  training office.
  6.8.3. Class Surging. Class surging will be coordinated between MAJCOMs due to
  relationships of the many ATS resources. Refer to the ATS contract class capacity
  allowances.
  6.8.4. Class Size. Annual throughput for specific ATS courses is established in the ATS
  contract. The AETC PFT document reflects formal school throughput based on Air Force
  requirements and what is authorized by contract. If the contract throughput for any MOB
  (formal school or otherwise) will be exceeded, AMC/A3T will coordinate those requirements
  through appropriate Air Force and ATS contractor channels. In conjunction with their PO or
  COR office, wing or group training offices will monitor annual throughput (current or
  projected) according to their MOB ATS authorized throughput and notify AMC/A3T of
  differences either above or below what is authorized in the contract.
     6.8.4.1. Every attempt will be made by MOB wing or group training office to ensure all
     classes are filled before requesting secondary method.
     6.8.4.2. ATS training at alternate sites. The ATS contractor determines the required
     number of ATS instructors and resources needed to accommodate annual throughput.
     Projected annual throughput is based on Air Force manpower data, which includes
     assigned, on-loan, and attached active duty as well as designated ARC and other units
     specified to be trained at that MOB. Trainee scheduling at a particular MOB should be
     kept within the units designated for that MOB. If a unit is unable to complete their
     requirements at a designated site, units may receive training at another site with prior
     coordination between the unit and the site.
  6.8.5. Cancellations. Deletions from the ATS schedule will vary at each training site
  because of training courses offered and the impact to scheduling. Continued cancellations
  will greatly impact the overall annual training plan, and the contractor may be unable to
  accommodate the original, planned throughput.
     6.8.5.1. Cancellation procedures will be developed at each MOB between contractor and
     wing training.
     6.8.5.2. Cancellation for ATS formal school courses. According to ETCA, HQ
     AETC/A3R must be notified 45-days before a formal school start date if a course
     allocation cancellation or no-fill is pending. This suspense should enable the class quota
     to be reallocated. Formal school cancellations will be made not later than 30-days before
     class start date, due to the impact of scheduling changes on the PFT. EXCEPTION:
     Emergency leave. HQ AETC/A3R will remove quotas and either reallocate or cancel
     affected quota or class.
  6.8.6. Wing Option Time. ATS contractor is required to provide Air Force use of training
  equipment at each site. Amount of time varies by site. Use of this time is prioritized within
  the contract.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                   85


   6.8.7. ATS Course Prerequisites. ATS courses may require trainee preparation before class
   start. If required, the prerequisites are an integral portion of the course and will be
   accomplished to receive course completion credit. Prerequisites may consist of reviewing
   study references, quizzes, performance data preparation, workbooks, etc. Required
   prerequisites are described in the appropriate student training guide or syllabus. Failure to
   complete the prerequisites will disrupt the scheduled training and, in some cases, may result
   in dismissal from the course.
   6.8.8. Late or No-Show. Course completion credit may be withheld when trainee tardiness
   interferes with class training. While ATS contractor personnel are not required to substitute
   for missing or late crewmembers, contractor personnel may fill a crew position per existing
   contractor / government agreements.
   6.8.9. Crew Complement for Refresher Training. Units will normally schedule a qualified
   crew (aircraft commander, copilot, flight engineer, and navigator) to attend refresher training.
   On a case-by-case basis, units may schedule other than a normal crew complement subject to
   advance coordination with the contractor. Advance coordination is very important since the
   contractor is not required to provide training unless the crew composition complies with the
   contract or current agreements. In most cases, the contractor will provide training but does
   not have to issue completion certificates for other than normal crew complement. In that
   case, units will determine if training received met training requirements for annual refresher
   training and allow the crew to credit the event.
6.9. Administration:
   6.9.1. ATS Feedback
      6.9.1.1. The COR is the liaison between the Administrative Contracting
      Officer/Procuring Contracting Officer (ACO/PCO) and the ATS contractor. CORs are
      the only Air Force personnel empowered to evaluate any component of contract
      compliance. These individuals are entrusted with quality assurance, are the only
      appropriate office (unit-level) to direct contractor to perform or stop work via the ACO/
      PCO’s direction, and are accountable for these actions. Each wing or group commander
      will establish ATS COR positions and enforce directives, requirements, and procedures
      established by Department of Defense (DoD) and MAJCOM directives and publications.
      ATS CORs will maintain a current copy of the ATS contract(s), designated quality
      assurance regulations and directives, and quality assurance procedures.
      6.9.1.2. Operational Evaluation. The ATS contractor is required to evaluate the ATS
      program and its graduates’ on-the-job performance as stated in the contract.
      6.9.1.3. Feedback includes inputs from graduates, flight commanders (or designated
      representatives), and evaluators. Analysis of actual performance (Air Force evaluation)
      and trainee critique data help to determine if graduates’ on-the-job performance meets
      MTL and established performance standards. The importance of this on-the-job
      performance feedback from graduates, flight commanders, and evaluators cannot be
      overemphasized. This data is vital to establishing a database to identify trends and
      support revisions to the ATS.
   6.9.2. ATS Data Collection. Internal and external data will be collected, reported, and
   corrective actions taken according to approved operation evaluation plan.
 86                                                       AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012


6.10. Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors.
   6.10.1. Air Force Flight Instructor Observations. The MATS contractor may provide
   opportunities for Air Force flight instructors to observe trainee progress in ATDs (if provided
   within the contract). Likewise, MATS instructors may observe the trainee's aircraft flights, if
   in the contract. Every reasonable effort should be made to ensure this type of interface
   continues at each training site.
   6.10.2. Contractor Personnel Flight Operations. If contract specifies, MATS instructors may
   observe USAF flights IAW AFI 11-401 and contract requirements.
6.11. C-130 ATS Facility Tours.
   6.11.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for C-130 ATS facility tours with
   the contractor as soon as possible, but in no case later than 24-hours before the planned
   event. This may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. Air Force
   option time may be used at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-available
   basis and will not displace scheduled training events.
   6.11.2. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
   conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.
   The contractor is responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.
AFI11-2C-130V1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                   87

7.4. Airdrop (AD) Events. Log an airdrop event when a successful airdrop is accomplished
(see Attachment 4). Pilots and flight engineers may log actual loads or training bundles. If a
no-drop condition occurs after the slowdown checklist is completed, aircraft commanders will
determine if enough training was accomplished to credit the airdrop for any crew position. See
event descriptions for further guidance. Both pilots may credit the airdrop event.
   7.4.1. Employment Altitudes. These definitions are separate from the altitude definitions in
   AFTTP 3-1.GP, which are not applicable to C-130 training. In the event of overlap (e.g.,
   more than 10,000' MSL, but less than 2500' AGL due to mountainous terrain), use the most
   logical category for the type of airdrop being flown, and procedures being used. See AFI 11-
   2C-130v3, AFTTP 3-3.C-130, and AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, for
   additional information on employment altitudes. Use the following altitude definitions:
       7.4.1.1. Very Low Altitude. Surface to 999' above ground level (AGL). Used for many
       drops.
       7.4.1.2. Low Altitude. 1000' AGL to 2499' AGL. Used for many drops.
       7.4.1.3. Medium Altitude. 2500' AGL to 9,999' MSL. Typically used for I-
       CDS/JPADS, HALO, HAHO, and other types of drops but has no special oxygen
       requirements. See AFI 11-231 for minimum HALO/HAHO altitudes.
       7.4.1.4. High Altitude. 10,000' MSL to 17,999' MSL. Airdrops conducted at these
       altitudes have special oxygen requirements. See AFI 11-202v3, General Flight Rules,
       and AFI 11-2C-130v3.
       7.4.1.5. Very High Altitude. 18,000' MSL and above. Airdrops conducted at these
       altitudes have special oxygen requirements, including pre-breathing. See AFI 11-202v3
       and AFI 11-2C-130v3.
          7.4.1.5.1. AD01 Basic Airdrop Event

           7.4.1.5.1.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
           7.4.1.5.1.6. Additional Information: Flight engineers may log this event when all
           enroute and airdrop checklist are accomplished. In the event of a planned or
           unplanned no-drop condition, the aircraft commander will determine if sufficient
           events were accomplished to credit this event. Loadmasters may log this event
           with any airdrop to include SATBs.
        7.4.1.5.2. AD03 Equipment/SATB-H
           7.4.1.5.2.1. Purpose: Continuation training for mission ready crewmembers.

           7.4.1.5.2.6. Additional Information: Loadmasters log this event when an actual
           heavy equipment load is loaded, rigged, all checklists through the slowdown
           checklist are accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition due to either
           loadmaster. Navigators will log this event when an actual heavy equipment
           airdrop is successfully completed. If a planned or unplanned no-drop condition
           occurs after the slow-down checklist is completed, aircraft commanders will
           determine if enough training was accomplished for pilots to credit the event.
        7.4.1.5.3. AD04 Containerized Delivery System / SATB-C

           CDS bundle is loaded, rigged, all checklists through the slowdown checklist are
           accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition due to either loadmaster.
           Navigators will log this event when an actual CDS bundle is successfully
           airdropped. If a planned or unplanned no-drop condition occurs after the slow-
           down checklist is completed, aircraft commanders will determine if enough
           training was accomplished for pilots to credit the event.
        7.4.1.5.4. AD05 Personnel / SATB-P Airdrop

        7.4.1.5.4.6. Additional Information: Loadmasters log this event only when actual
        personnel are loaded, rigged, all checklists through the slowdown checklist are
        accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition due to either loadmaster. Use
        AD05A for actual airdrops. Navigators will log successful actual personnel or
        training bundle drops (see Table 4.4). If a planned or unplanned no-drop
        condition occurs after the slow-down checklist is completed, aircraft commanders
        will determine if enough training was accomplished for navigators (when
        dropping a training bundle) and pilots to credit the event.
     7.4.1.5.5. AD06 Visual Airdrop
        7.4.1.5.5.1. Purpose: Continuation training for mission ready crewmembers.

        7.4.1.5.6.6. Additional Information: AWADS airdrop certified crewmembers are
        not required to fly or track AD07, SKE Airdrop. If AWADS crews fly a SKE-
        only airplane or equipment problems require a SKE airdrop, AWADS units may
        elect to credit AD07 to accurately reflect training accomplished. Do not credit
        AD07 and AD08 on the same airdrop.
     7.4.1.5.7. AD08 AWADS Airdrop
        7.4.1.5.7.1. Purpose: Continuation training for AWADS airdrop certified

           7.4.1.5.7.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
           7.4.1.5.7.6. Additional Information: AWADS airdrop certified crewmembers are
           not required to fly or track AD07, SKE Airdrop. If AWADS crews fly a SKE-
           only airplane or equipment problems require a SKE airdrop, AWADS units may
           elect to credit AD07 to accurately reflect training accomplished. Do not credit
           AD07 and AD08 on the same airdrop.
        7.4.1.5.8. AD09 JPADS Medium/High Altitude Airdrop
           7.4.1.5.8.1. Purpose: Continuation training for mission-ready crewmembers.
           7.4.1.5.8.2. Description: JPADS (guided or unguided) airdrop at medium or high
           altitude. See paragraph 7.4.1 and Attachment 1 for airdrop altitude definitions.
           Crewmembers should attempt to practice this event at the highest practical
           altitude commensurate with DZ size and airspace restrictions. See AFTTP 3-3.C-
           130, AFI 11-2C-130V3, AFI 11-231, and AFI 13-217 for medium/high-altitude
           airdrop procedures and restrictions.
           7.4.1.5.8.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
           7.4.1.5.8.4. Training Media: Aircraft or USAF-certified WST.
           7.4.1.5.8.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
           7.4.1.5.8.6. Additional Information: Crewmembers will perform their airdrop
           duties while on oxygen in order to credit the event, regardless of airdrop altitude
           flown. If DZ size does not permit dropping at or above the minimum for medium
           altitude, actual airdrop may be simulated at medium / high altitude as long as all
           checklists are completed. If local airspace or other restrictions preclude flying the
           airdrop at medium/high altitudes, units may credit this event in the simulator, or
           accomplish the event at low altitude if no other alternative is available. However,
           the intent is to fly an actual JPADS (guided or unguided) airdrop in the aircraft at
           or above 10,000' MSL, whenever practical.
        7.4.1.5.9. AD10 JPADS (guided) Airdrop
           7.4.1.5.9.1. Purpose: Continuation training for JPADS certified loadmasters.
           7.4.1.5.9.2. Description: JPADS (guided) airdrop to include flight station and
           cargo compartment configuration JPADS checklists, and JPADS (guided) airdrop
           to an appropriate DZ. Certified loadmasters will drop an actual JPADS (guided)
           bundle. If DZ requirements prevent actual drop, simulate a guided bundle drop
           through completion of the JPADS (guided) airdrop slowdown checklist.

        7.4.1.5.9.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
        7.4.1.5.9.6. Additional Information: If dropping an actual JPADS guided bundle
        is not practical, loadmasters still require an AGU rigged on a bundle aboard the
        aircraft to simulate all necessary checklist steps. Loadmasters may credit the
        event if all checklists through slowdown are complete.
     7.4.1.5.10. AD11 PADS Operator Unguided Airdrop.
        7.4.1.5.10.1. Purpose:    Continuation training for PO certified mission-ready
        pilots.
        7.4.1.5.10.2. Description: I-CDS (JPADS unguided) airdrop to include mission
        planning, JPADS computer preflight and in-flight actions, flight station and cargo
        compartment configuration, JPADS checklists, dropsonde release/monitoring,
        airdrop damage estimate, and I-CDS airdrop to an appropriate DZ. Crews will
        comply with all requirements of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone
        Operations. The I-CDS airdrop is considered complete with successful
        deployment of the dropsonde(s), update of the release point via PADS computer
        and airdrop of the bundle. There is no minimum altitude for this event when
        accomplished in the aircraft, other than the minimum altitude to release a
        dropsonde, though realistic AFTTP 3-3.C-130J altitudes should be used to the
        maximum extent possible based on airspace and DZ restrictions.
        7.4.1.5.10.3. In the event that the dropsonde(s) was (were) deployed but
        insufficient dropsonde data was gathered to update the release point with the
        PADS computer, the crew will make all reasonable attempts to troubleshoot the
        problem, to include completion of the I-CDS/JPADS troubleshooting guide. If
        these procedures fail to correct the problem, then at the discretion of the aircraft
        commander, the event can still be considered complete if the crew successfully
        airdrops the bundle by completing the I-CDS/JPADS to Conventional Quick
        Transition Checklist, and performing a racetrack/re-attack using conventional
        ballistic CDS procedures.
        7.4.1.5.10.4. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D

        7.4.1.5.10.7. Additional Information: Must perform all PO duties to credit the
        event. POs may credit this event in any MDS. POs may not log this event while
        occupying either pilot's seat. May dual log with AD04, AD09 and AD12 (in any
        combination) if all requirements of each of the respective events are met. If
        performing PO duties in a different MDS, POs will only log AD11.

              airdrop. Crews will comply with all requirements of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and
              Landing Zone Operations. The guided system airdrop is considered complete with
              update of the release point and launch acceptability region (LAR) using the
              JPADS computer (with or without sonde data), wireless transfer to the AGU, and
              completion of all checklists through the slowdown checklist. If equipment and
              DZs are available, 50% of AD12 events must end in actual guided airdrop.
              Minimum altitudes for actual guided airdrops are IAW specific requirements of
              each guided system and AFI 13-217.

7.21. Visual Threat Recognition and Avoidance Trainer (VTRAT) Training (VT)
Events. VTRAT is a training device designed to introduce or refresh scanners on their duties
during an anti-aircraft threat engagement. The visual simulation displays realistic visual
characteristics of anti-aircraft weaponry such as missile fly-out and AAA rate-of-fire, as seen
from the scanner’s viewpoint in the aircraft. Instruction in VTRAT is delivered in the context of
flight over a simulated threat environment. The student views this environment on a high-
resolution display system, from the perspective of his/her duty position. The student hears the
instructional text through a headset, and interacts with the trainer via a voice recognition system,
as well as the communication and flares countermeasures controls available on the real-world
aircraft. VTRAT diagnoses weak areas of student performance and emphasizes training in these
areas until mastery of the specific threat protocol is achieved. OG/CC is waiver authority for
VTRAT training.
   7.21.1. VT01 VTRAT Initial Training
       7.21.1.1. Purpose: Initial training for crewmembers.

     maneuver is graded ―U‖ after having achieved ―P‖ in the same task. Regression from a
     ―P‖ to a ―U‖ requires an explanation in the student’s training folder. The overall grade is
     at the instructor’s discretion. For regression, the student will re-obtain proficiency prior
     to the end of the block of training in order to be recommended for a flight evaluation
     (when applicable) or certification (when applicable).

                                    AIRDROP SCORING

A4.1. Airdrop Scoring. Crewmembers may credit an airdrop event if the load exits the aircraft
and is scored as a successful drop. See specific event description in Chapter 7 for additional
guidance.
   A4.1.1. In order to be considered successful, the adjusted drop score must fall within the
   basic allowable circular error. For personnel and equipment airdrops use 300 meters. For
   Containerized Delivery System (CDS) use 200 meters. To determine the adjusted drop score,
   first make distance adjustments then, if applicable, adjust for wingman position. NOTE:
   HALO / HAHO airdrops are graded satisfactory if personnel land on the drop zone, or
   unsatisfactory if they do not.
   A4.1.2. Distance Adjustments. There are two distance adjustments that may apply: altitude
   corrections and night VFR corrections.
       A4.1.2.1. Altitude corrections. For personnel and equipment airdrops above 800' AGL,
       add 15 meters for each 100' above 800' to a maximum total CE of 600 meters. For CDS
       airdrops above 600' AGL, add 20 meters for each 100' above 600' to a maximum total CE
       of 400 meters. NOTE: Do not interpolate, just add 15 or 20 meters for every 100-foot
       increment above the minimum drop altitude.
       A4.1.2.2. Night VFR corrections. For night visual airdrops, add 50 meters to allowable
       CE not to exceed the above maximums. NOTE: This correction applies to night visual
       drops (including visual wingmen) and SKE lead drops using visual procedures at night
       (but never SKE wingmen).
       A4.1.2.3. Add the altitude corrections to the basic allowable CE to get the adjusted CE.
       NOTE: If a day VFR drop is made within 100 feet of the minimum drop altitude, the
       adjusted CE is equal to the basic allowable CE.
       A4.1.2.4. Take the drop score distance, multiply by the basic allowable CE and divide by
       the adjusted CE to get the adjusted drop score.
       A4.1.2.5. Example: A night visual HE airdrop made 150 feet above minimum drop
       altitude with a basic drop score of 50 meters at 12 o’clock. The basic allowable CE is
       300 meters plus 15 meters (altitude correction) plus 50 meters (night VFR correction)
       results in an adjusted CE of 365 meters. The adjusted drop score would then be the
       product of 50 meters multiplied by 300 meters divided by 365 meters, or 41.1 meters.
   A4.1.3. Wingman Adjustments.
   A4.1.3.1. VFR Wingmen Adjustments. This drop score will be in relation to an adjusted
   point of impact (PI), referred to as the reference PI. The reference PI is an adjustment to
   element lead’s drop score along the 12/6 o’clock axis such that it intersects the 3/9 o’clock
   axis (if required). When the drift is less than three degrees, right wingmen will move
   reference PI 50 yards right, and measure their load’s impact point from this adjusted

   A4.1.2 apply to adjust circular error.
   A4.1.3.2. SKE Wingman Adjustments. This drop score will be in relation to the reference PI
   when the drift correction setting is two degrees or less in the SKE secondary control panel.
   Lead’s (or element lead’s) drop will be adjusted along the 3/9 o’clock axis and offset as
   indicated in table A4.1. Drift more than 3 degrees is not adjusted from Lead’s PI. Distance
   adjustments as described in A4.1.2 apply to adjust circular error. Note: Night VFR Wingman
   Adjustments do not apply to SKE drops. Exception: Non-AWADS units using visual
   procedures.
