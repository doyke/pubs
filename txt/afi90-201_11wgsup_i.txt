   1.7.1. AFIA/IO, in coordination with SAF/IGI, provides oversight assessments to MAJCOM/CCs
   and The Inspector General (TIG) on the consistency of MAJCOM nuclear surety inspections. Con-
   ducts in-depth trend analysis, assesses the sufficiency of corrective actions to inspection findings, and
   provides finding status and metrics to personnel in the AF nuclear surety arena.
   1.7.2. As AF clearinghouse for MAJCOM responses to DTRA Nuclear Weapon Technical Inspection
   findings, reviews critical and major nuclear surety deficiencies identified in DTRA inspection reports.
   Requests clarification of deficiencies. Reviews MAJCOM actions taken to correct these deficiencies
   and endorses them to DTRA. In cases where AFIA or DTRA non-concurs, AFIA/IO returns correc-
   tive action responses to MAJCOM for clarification. Seeks consultative assistance from AFSC/SEW
   as needed.

       1.7.2.1. Provides nuclear surety-related oversight of NSIs, Limited Nuclear Surety Inspections
       (LNSIs) and Initial Nuclear Surety Inspections (INSIs) by overseeing 25 percent of the total
       annual MAJCOM-conducted NSIs. Additionally, provides observer(s) when DTRA/CSTI
       inspects Air Force units under the auspices of TO 11N-25-1. AFIA will coordinate each NSI visit
       with the respective MAJCOM IG Gatekeeper and will honor the IG trusted agent system to protect
       the minimum or no-notice aspect of the inspection. In the course of directly observing MAJCOM
       inspectors conducting their activities, AFIA/IO team members will not intervene in the inspection
       process unless the safety, security, or reliability of a weapon is in jeopardy and the MAJCOM
       inspectors fail to take appropriate actions to correct the situation. At the conclusion of each
       inspection visit, the AFIA team chief will provide SAF/IGI a brief, unrated, written account of
       observations identifying areas for improving the NSI process. Specific areas to be addressed in
       each report include:
           a. Whether the MAJCOM inspectors were qualified and trained.
           b. Whether current MAJCOM IG checklists and inspection guides were used.
           c. Whether there were any contentious issues in the conduct of the inspection.
           d. Whether policy and guidance was clear and being implemented as intended.
           e. Whether the MAJCOM IG validation process with the inspected unit and staff was suffi-
              cient and effective.
           f. Whether the inspection team sufficiently documented the inspection results.
           g. An overall assessment of the inspection results.
           h. A review of the MAJCOM team's deliberate process from inspection work-up to publica-
              tion of the final report.
       As a final note, AFIA concurrence with MAJCOM IG team findings is not required.
    1.7.3. Coordinates the proposed DTRA NSI inspection schedule for AF units.

                       AIR FORCE INSPECTION PROGRAM ELEMENTS

2.1. General Guidelines . Independent inspections are conducted by MAJCOM IGs, AFIA, and func-
tional staffs to provide the SECAF, CSAF, and MAJCOM/CCs status reports on unit efficiency, effective-
ness, combat readiness, and nuclear surety. In this regard, MAJCOMs will establish inspection programs
consistent with MAJCOM mission requirements to inspect unit readiness, compliance, nuclear surety and
other inspection program elements outlined in this chapter. They will develop applicable guidelines, pro-
cedures, and criteria for conducting these inspections.
   2.1.1. Inspection Footprint. It is Air Force policy to minimize the inspection footprint to the maxi-
   mum extent practical. The use of sampling techniques (using standard mathematically valid statistical
   models), combined inspections, credit for unit activity in conjunction with exercises and contingen-
   cies, and other measures of sustained performance may be accomplished as deemed appropriate by
   individual MAJCOMs. Whenever practical, IG teams may deploy to forward locations and headquar-
   ters during exercises and contingency operations to evaluate processes and performance. Inspectors
   may observe, but will not interfere with real world activities, unless a serious situation dictates or
   when input has been thoroughly coordinated with host base and affected unit commanders.
   2.1.2. Inspection Alignment with AEF Rhythm. In order to ensure inspection programs adapt to the
   current AEF environment, MAJCOMs will, when possible, align inspection schedules with the AEF
   flow. Inspection schedules will be coordinated/deconflicted with known major AEF deployments
   (more than 20 percent of a wing's assigned personnel deployed). Unless requested by the commander,
   units will not be inspected within 30 days of a major AEF deployment or within 30 days after their
   return. MAJCOMs will submit a Quarterly AEF Alignment Report when unit inspections are con-
   ducted during a unit’s AEF window. Reporting of inspection alignment need only be done by excep-
   tion. Additionally, if a MAJCOM must conduct a "non-aligned" inspection, notify SAF/IGI by email
   with a brief explanation of why the inspection was performed during a unit's AEF window encom-
   passing an AEF deployment.
   2.1.3. Inspection Guides. MAJCOM functional staffs will develop inspection checklist items (with
   references) for use by command IG teams and installation exercise evaluation teams (EET). MAJ-
   COM IGs will ensure critical items requiring direct IG evaluation are clearly annotated. Inspection
   guides may be published to a web site or included in a formal MAJCOM Sup to this AFI. Whatever
   the choice of publication, guides will be current within 90 days of the publication of the last AFI or
   MAJCOM supplement--whichever comes later. The MAJCOM IG will coordinate with staff func-
   tionals and post the location of the current guide with its effective date.
   2.1.4. Grading System. Inspection team chiefs may assign ratings that accurately reflect observed
   performance regardless of statistical outcomes. Specific criteria are designed as a guide and are not a
   substitute for the judgment of the inspector. However, when ratings differ significantly from estab-
   lished criteria, the rationale should be explained.
   2.1.5. Validation. Each MAJCOM will establish a validation process and ensure all inspectors are
   aware of MAJCOM procedures and expectations regarding validation. Confirming initial observa-
   tions, deficiencies, and conclusions gives the inspected unit an opportunity to clarify and/or rebut
   those observations, thereby avoiding misunderstandings and improving accuracy. Validation is most
10                                                               AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


     effective when initiated at the inspector level. Policy interpretation will be resolved by the appropriate
     MAJCOM functional OPR. Once deficiencies are validated, they become “findings.”
     2.1.6. Installation Exercise Program Office.
        2.1.6.1. Organization. The wing/installation commander determines whether the exercise pro-
        gram falls under the CV, XP or IG. Manpower authorizations are not earned for the installation
        exercise program and staffing must be obtained from within organizational resources. SAF/IG
        recommends using the guidelines in paragraph 2.1.6.2. to staff the office. These numbers are over
        and above the wing/installation IG and senior enlisted assistant for matters relating to complaints
        and fraud, waste and abuse.
        2.1.6.2. Staffing. Staff the office with one officer (O-4 or civilian equivalent) and one enlisted
        (E-7 or civilian equivalent) position. Provide one additional person for each 1,500-wing/installa-
        tion personnel increment above 1,000. Staff the first increment position with an enlisted person
        (E-7 with information management background preferred) and the second position with an officer
        (O-3). Staff all subsequent positions with an enlisted person (E-7). Add one additional enlisted
        position (E-7) if unit has a nuclear mission. All positions may be filled using higher-grade level,
        equivalent grade civil service civilian, or by contract personnel with skills and experience equiva-
        lent to the core position.
        2.1.6.3. Training. Prior to evaluating wing/installation activities, EET members will complete the
        core training outlined in AFI 10-2501. Additional training may be required when directed by the
        EET Chief or to enable EET members to meet specialized team, functional area, host-nation, or
        local requirements or standards. EET members may attend the Air Force Inspectors Course as
        outlined in Para 2.8."

2.2. Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI).
     2.2.1. Execution. ORIs are conducted to evaluate and measure the ability of units with a wartime,
     contingency, or force sustainment mission to perform assigned operational missions (e.g., Designed
     Operational Capability (DOC), Air Force Worldwide Unit Type Code System (AFWUS), Mission
     Essential Task List (METL), and/or mission statement associated taskings and assigned OPLAN task-
     ings, etc.). For scheduling purposes, MAJCOMs may conduct ORIs in two phases. Phase I will eval-
     uate the unit’s transition from peacetime readiness into a wartime posture and the unit's ability to
     maintain and sustain essential home station missions during and after the deployment of mobility
     forces. Phase II will evaluate the unit’s ability to meet wartime taskings. USAFE may substitute a
     unit’s NATO Tactical Evaluations (TACEVAL) for ORI credit.
        2.2.1.1. Scenarios. IG teams should attempt to create a realistic environment for evaluation while
        ensuring safety is not compromised. ORI scenarios should evaluate both sustained performance
        and contingency response. Since units must be ready to meet the full range of potential assigned
        taskings, IGs should periodically assess these units against robust OPLAN taskings. Whenever
        practical, scenarios may be combined with those of other MAJCOMs, exercises, and contingency
        events.
        2.2.1.2. Major Graded Areas. Units with a wartime or contingency mission will be evaluated in
        four major areas: initial response, employment, mission support, and the ability to survive and
        operate (ATSO) in a hostile environment. These four areas are presented in Attachment 5 along
        with applicable subareas. MAJCOMs may modify major graded areas to account for the variety of
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                     11


     wartime or contingency missions that exist. IGs will apply the common core readiness criteria
     (described in paragraph 2.2.4.) to each of the applicable major graded areas and sub-areas and sup-
     plement them, as required, to develop comprehensive inspections.
     2.2.1.3. Performance. IG teams should focus on mission performance. Academic testing should
     not be used as a primary measure of readiness unless it serves a specific inspection objective, or
     hands-on performance cannot be observed.
  2.2.2. ORI Frequency. Although optimum frequency for readiness inspections varies among MAJ-
  COMs, an outer boundary of no more than 60 months (i.e., 3 AEF Cycles) between Operational
  Readiness Inspections is required. MAJCOM commander approval is required to exceed this time
  period. Inspections scheduled within 120 days of the 60-month interval do not require a waiver. For
  Air Reserve Component (ARC) units, advance notice will be approximately one year.
  2.2.3. ORI Grading. The five-tier rating system (consisting of Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory,
  Marginal, and Unsatisfactory as defined in Attachment 1) will be used for major graded areas and
  overall wing performance.
  2.2.4. Common Core Readiness Criteria (CCRC). CCRC represent seven basic, over-arching readi-
  ness criteria that all MAJCOM IGs will apply to each area of their respective ORIs. Each CCRC has
  one or more associated questions to facilitate its use by inspectors.
     2.2.4.1. Threat. Is the unit able to implement and sustain appropriate measures to meet changing
     force protection condition, alarm, information, air defense, and homeland security threat advisory
     conditions, as appropriate for the threat and unit location?
     2.2.4.2. Safety. Does the unit safety program facilitate unit readiness?
     2.2.4.3. Security. Were appropriate physical security measures employed throughout the exer-
     cise? Were OPSEC procedures incorporated into plans and followed throughout the exercise?
     Were proper COMSEC materials available, as specified in tasked operations plans, to ensure mis-
     sion accomplishment? Were INFOSEC, COMPUSEC, and OPSEC employed to deny the enemy
     information?
     2.2.4.4. Communications and Information. Were these operations effective?
     2.2.4.5. Training. Were units properly trained and equipped to perform wartime duties?
     2.2.4.6. Operational Risk Management (ORM). Were units applying ORM principles and con-
     cepts to assess the risks associated with their daily mission?
     2.2.4.7. Emergency Management (EM). Did the installation establish a single integrated EM Pro-
     gram to coordinate and organize unit efforts to manage, prepare for, respond to, and recover from
     the direct and indirect consequences of CBRNE and conventional weapon attacks, major accidents
     and natural disasters?
  2.2.5. Contracted Functions. As a minimum, identify those contracts that are critical for the unit to
  accomplish its mission, sample the contractor’s performance (through the Quality Assurance Person-
  nel) as compared to the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements and evaluate the adequacy
  of PWS as written to satisfy mission requirements. Ensure the Quality Assurance Program and Perfor-
  mance Plan provide effective oversight of the contract and PWS. Refer to Attachment 5 for the appli-
  cable major graded areas and subareas and apply the CCRCs to determine which contracts to assess
  during the readiness inspection to ensure unit capability to accomplish the unit mission.
12                                                              AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


        2.2.5.1. Grading and Report. Contracted support activities grades will be five-tier and results inte-
        grated into the overall unit ORI report. MAJCOMs are encouraged to focus on the results of the
        contracted activity in support of the unit mission and to identify strengths and weaknesses. The
        report is not releasable to the individual contractors; however, Contracting Officers may provide
        contractors with the findings annotated that relate directly to the contractor’s performance per the
        specific contract.
        2.2.5.2. Findings. The Contracting Officer, Quality Assurance Program Coordinator, and Quality
        Assurance Personnel will review findings associated with contractor performance prior to inclu-
        sion in the Readiness Inspection report. If feasible, the Contracting Officer or Quality Assurance
        Personnel should accompany the IG during inspections. Findings will be tracked per applicable
        MAJCOM guidance until closeout.
        2.2.5.3. Inspector Training. Prior to inspecting contracted support activities, inspectors and aug-
        mentees will complete Phase I (Basic Contract Oversight) training IAW AFI 63-124. Additional
        MAJCOM or Phase II contract specific training needed to facilitate the inspection is highly rec-
        ommended.
        2.2.5.4. Contractor Relations. Only the contracting officer can take formal action against the con-
        tractor for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during inspec-
        tions. Develop and implement safeguards to prevent unnecessary contractor claims resulting from
        contracted activities inspections.
        2.2.5.5. Quality Assurance Personnel and the Performance Plan. Evaluate the effectiveness of the
        Quality Assurance Program on satisfying mission requirements. Ensure quality assurance person-
        nel training, contract management, and assessment of contractor performance in accordance with
        the performance plan.
     2.2.6. Nuclear ORI (NORI). While conducting a NORI, applicable areas of nuclear surety will be
     inspected as a subset of the overall readiness inspection. Where applicable, nuclear surety criteria will
     be applied IAW Chapter 3 and reported in a separate area of the ORI report or as a separate report.
     The MAJCOM IG team chief is responsible for determining the impact of nuclear surety deficiencies
     on the overall rating for the ORI. For units assigned to USAFE, NATO Strike Evaluations (STRIKE
     EVALS) may be substituted for NORI credit.
     2.2.7. Air and Space Operations Center ORI (AOC ORI). While conducting an AOC ORI, inspect
     CCRCs and applicable areas in Attachment 9.

2.3. Compliance Inspection (CI).
     2.3.1. Execution. CIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well as mission areas identi-
     fied by senior Air Force and MAJCOM leadership as critical or important to assess/assure the health
     and performance of organizations. Unit failure to comply with the established directives in these areas
     could result in significant legal liabilities, penalties, or significant mission impact.
     2.3.2. CI Frequency. Historical data has shown that excessive periods between major inspections can
     result in conditions that significantly degrade effective and efficient mission accomplishment.
     Although optimum frequency for compliance inspections varies among MAJCOMs, an outer bound-
     ary of no more than 60 months (i.e., 3 AEF Cycles) between unit compliance inspections is required.
     MAJCOM commander approval is required to exceed this time period. Inspections scheduled within
     120 days of the 60-month interval do not require a waiver.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                        13


   2.3.3. CI Grading. Three-tier grading (e.g., in compliance / in compliance with comments / not in
   compliance) is usually sufficient to assure adequate oversight of each common core compliance area.
   However, each MAJCOM will determine its own grading scale.
   2.3.4. Common Core Compliance Areas. During CIs, MAJCOM IGs will evaluate each common
   core compliance area (CCCA) based on by-law requirements, executive orders, DOD directives,
   Combatant Commands, Air Force, MAJCOM, and applicable Air National Guard Instructions. Func-
   tional Area Manager (FAM) evaluations may suffice in lieu of IG inspections provided the FAM eval-
   uations meet or exceed the requirements of the CCCAs contained in this directive. In addition, if the
   IG elects to incorporate FAM evaluations into the inspection process, the MAJCOM IG staff will
   coordinate with the FAM on the evaluation checklists prior to the evaluation and will review the
   results following the evaluation. The MAJCOM IG will also publish the results of FAM evaluations in
   the next MAJCOM IG inspection report for that unit. Minimum Air Force-level CCCAs are outlined
   in Attachment 6. MAJCOM/ DRUs should supplement this general guidance as required.
   2.3.5. Contracted Functions. Sample the contractor’s performance (through the Quality Assurance
   Personnel) as compared to the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements and evaluate the
   Quality Assurance Program to ensure effective oversight of the contract. MAJCOM functional check-
   lists will be tailored to address differences between Air Force checklists and PWS requirements. As a
   minimum, evaluate the Quality Assurance Personnel and Performance Plan for contracts servicing Air
   Force-level CCCAs outlined in Attachment 6. Inspection of contracted functions not outlined in
   Attachment 6 may be added at MAJCOM discretion.
       2.3.5.1. Grading and Report. The Quality Assurance Program will be inspected and the contracted
       function will be graded; however, individual contractors will not be graded. An adequate sampling
       of contracted activity, coordinated through the Quality Assurance Personnel, will be observed to
       sufficiently evaluate the Quality Assurance Program. Findings generated during the inspection
       will be annotated in the overall report. The report is not releasable to the individual contractors;
       however, Contracting Officers may provide contractors with the findings annotated that relate
       directly to the contractor’s performance per the specific contract.
       2.3.5.2. Findings. The Contracting Officer, Quality Assurance Program Coordinator, or Quality
       Assurance Personnel will review findings associated with contractor performance prior to inclu-
       sion in the Compliance Inspection report. The Contracting Officer and/or Quality Assurance Per-
       sonnel should accompany the IG during inspections. Findings will be tracked per applicable
       MAJCOM guidance until closeout.
       2.3.5.3. Inspector Training. Prior to inspecting contracted support activities, inspectors and aug-
       mentees will complete Phase I and Phase II training. Additional MAJCOM contract specific train-
       ing needed to facilitate the inspection is highly recommended.
       2.3.5.4. Contractor Relations. Only the contracting officer can take formal action against the con-
       tractor for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during inspec-
       tions. Develop and implement safeguards to prevent unnecessary contractor claims resulting from
       contracted activities inspections.

2.4. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). Refer to guidance in Chapter 3.
14                                                               AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


2.5. Other Inspections. The following are examples of additional inspection requirements MAJCOM/
CCs may establish to evaluate various mission elements. These should be kept to the minimum necessary
consistent with mission requirements.
     2.5.1. Unit Self-Inspection. MAJCOMs should establish self-inspection program guidelines for sub-
     ordinate units. The intent is to provide commanders with a tool for internal assessment of unit health
     and to complement external inspections and assessments.
        2.5.1.1. Self-inspection programs should be tailored to each unit’s structure and mission, and con-
        tain mechanisms that ensure adequate coverage of the organization’s mission, resources, training,
        and people programs. Mechanisms may consist of periodically administered checklists, quality
        control reviews, internal audits, functional inspections, management information systems, numer-
        ical summaries, analysis programs, etc.
            2.5.1.1.1. (Added-11WG) Compliance Inspection Process
                2.5.1.1.1.1. (Added-11WG) Concept: The objective of the compliance and self-inspec-
                tion programs are to validate a unit’s adherence to requirements derived from Federal,
                DoD, Higher Headquarters (HHQ) Directives and compliance items identified in Compli-
                ance Inspection Checklists. The Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA) will certify 11th
                Wing compliance and identify best practices for wing-wide adoption and validate deficien-
                cies that may represent a program or process failure. Individual checklist items are
                assessed as either comply, comply with comments, or does not comply.
                2.5.1.1.1.2. (Added-11WG) Program Objective : The 11th Wing’s self-inspection pro-
                gram is a wing commander initiative that focuses on high-priority items of interest within
                each functional staff area of responsibility. The purpose of self-inspections is to provide
                commanders with a tool for internal assessment of unit health, proficiency, effectiveness,
                and compliance; and to complement external inspections and assessments. Unit failure to
                comply with the established directives in these areas could result in significant legal liabil-
                ities, penalties, or significant mission impact. Self-inspections are to occur every 6 months,
                February and August, and within 6 months of a new wing commander taking command.
                Self-inspections are essential in helping wings and units prepare for their Unit Compliance
                Inspections (UCIs).
                2.5.1.1.1.3. (Added-11WG) Goals: Well developed checklists and regular unit
                self-inspections are invaluable management tools to maintain internal quality control of
                the unit’s effectiveness. Inspections using validated checklists ensure unit compliance with
                changing regulations and policies. The Wing CIP has five main goals, which all levels
                should meet: (1) provide early detection of deviation from required standards of perfor-
                mance, (2) identify weaknesses, problems, and trends for management action, (3) provide
                a process to effectively implement and track corrective actions, (4) ensure Wing-wide
                review, implementation of corrective actions, and reporting as required for SAF/IG SIIs,
                and (5) identify, disseminate, and act on lessons learned and best practices from all
                sources.
            2.5.1.1.2. (Added-11WG) Responsibilities
                2.5.1.1.2.1. (Added-11WG) It is the responsibility of all commanders and directors to
                ensure compliance and implementation of the provisions of this instruction.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                        15


           2.5.1.1.2.2. (Added-11WG) Director of Staff, Group and Squadron Commanders will
           appoint, in writing, responsible personnel to execute the respective units CIP. Respective
           commanders will conduct a semi-annual review of the unit inspection program and ensure
           timely and thorough completion of all required inspections by qualified inspectors.
              2.5.1.1.2.2.1. (Added-11WG) Director of Staff, Group and Squadron Commanders
              will certify any unit developed self-inspection checklist to ensure it provides an accu-
              rate measure of required unit performance, correct and evaluate all discrepancies iden-
              tified by unit or subordinate unit’s inspections, and conduct monthly reviews of open
              discrepancies for corrective actions.
              2.5.1.1.2.2.2. (Added-11WG) Director of Staff and Group and Squadron Command-
              ers will provide status updates on critical findings and progress of corresponding cor-
              rective actions to the 11 WG/IGI and ensure updates are entered into the Wing
              Automated Checklist System (WACS). They must also encourage the discovery,
              review, and implementation of cross-tell information (i.e., lessons learned and best
              practices) from other units.
           2.5.1.1.2.3. (Added-11WG) The CIP Manager’s Responsibilities are to administer the
           Wing’s CIP to include providing guidance beyond the scope of this instruction. Ensure all
           functional areas are inspected during the semi-annual inspection. They will direct wing
           units to complete semi-annual inspections during the months of February and August and
           within six months of receiving a new Wing Commander. CIP Manager will direct all units
           to conduct inspections according to Air Force Instructions, 11th Wing Instructions and Air
           Force Special Interest Items (SII). Validate, consolidate, and report SII findings through
           squadron, group, 11 WG/IGI and wing leadership.
              2.5.1.1.2.3.1. (Added-11WG) The CIP Manager will ensure all internal and external
              inspection discrepancies are tracked in WACS until closure. Evaluate and track dis-
              crepancies that require HHQ involvement for resolution. Use the WACS database for
              tracking all CIP information, conducting trend analysis and producing reports and brief
              the Wing Commander as a minimum, on a quarterly basis, the inspection results and
              corrective actions status.
              2.5.1.1.2.3.2. (Added-11WG) The CIP Manager will assign self-inspection check-
              lists that can serve as a starting point for any unit that does not have a checklist. Include
              areas such as information management, personnel, safety, security, supply, and com-
              puter management. Coordinate the distribution of general checklists that apply to mul-
              tiple units through WACS.
           2.5.1.1.2.4. (Added-11WG) Staff/Group CIP Managers (GCIPMs) are responsible for
           the CIP at the group or staff agency level and conduct group or staff level inspections as
           required. GCIPMs will ensure units use the most current unit tailored checklist or
           unit-developed checklist maintained in WACS and will brief their Group Commanders/
           Director of Staff monthly on open discrepancies, corrective actions, and results of any
           recent SAVs. If a unit has any open (non-compliant) items, they will provide monthly
           updated status reports to the CIP Manager with detailed actions taken to correct discrepan-
           cies. It is not necessary to provide monthly updated status reports if a unit does not have
           any open (non-compliant) item.

        2.5.1.1.2.4.1. (Added-11WG) The GCIPMs will document and report the total num-
        ber of open and closed discrepancies broken out into each of the three categories of dis-
        crepancies: Compliance, Not in Compliance, and Comply w/ Comments for each
        subordinate unit. They must fully explain all critical findings and the associated correc-
        tive action plans and include trend analysis results whenever possible. Following each
        inspection, generate a Summary Report and forward, through the Group Commanders,
        11 WG/IGI, Director of Staff, and Wing Commander.
        2.5.1.1.2.4.2. (Added-11WG) The GCIPMs will track all discrepancies resulting
        from internal or external inspections until closed. Ensure units take aggressive action
        to correct discrepancies and report the status of corrective actions to their respective
        Group Commander and CIP Manager. Maintain accurate history of all discrepancies
        and corrective actions in WACS and maintain a GCIPM continuity binder IAW this
        supplement.
     2.5.1.1.2.5. (Added-11WG) Unit CIP Monitors (UCIPM) will conduct inspections as
     directed. All discrepancies identified during the inspection are required to be documented
     except those corrected on-the-spot. UCIPMs will maintain the unit’s CIP database
     (WACS) of all discrepancies and corrective actions. Track corrective action for all discrep-
     ancies following each inspection. Brief the GCIPM/unit commanders regularly on correc-
     tive action status. Ensure discrepancies are validated by the commander or his designated
     representative. Request external verification when appropriate, i.e., exercise event, exter-
     nal expert review, or SAVs.
        2.5.1.1.2.5.1. (Added-11WG) The UCIPMs will generate and forward a Summary
        Report to the unit commander through the GCIPM. The Summary Report will include
        the inspection completion date and total number of open and closed discrepancies bro-
        ken out into each of the three categories of discrepancies: Compliance, Not in Compli-
        ance, and Comply w/ Comments. Also, include in the report all Recommended
        Improvement Areas and provide a corrective action plan for all critical findings. The
        Summary Reports for semi-annual self-inspections are due to 11 WG/IGI by Close of
        Business (COB) 15 March/ 15 September respectively. Reports must be coordinated
        through respective GCIPM and commanders/directors before submitting to
        11 WG/IGI.
        2.5.1.1.2.5.2. (Added-11WG) The UCIPMs will ensure HHQ inspection checklists
        are available before a pending HHQ inspection, i.e. Unit Compliance Inspection
        Checklists. Develop a continuity binder that contains references for all materials that
        substantiate unit assessment of compliance or the corrective actions for each item that
        is not in compliance.
        2.5.1.1.2.5.3. (Added-11WG) The UCIPMs will distribute appropriate inspection
        material, crosstells, lessons learned, and best practices to appropriate Functional Area
        Managers (FAMs) and WCMs. These reports identify noteworthy management
        actions, laudatory comments, as well as significant process deficiencies. UCIPMs
        should find and apply these resources as appropriate to their unit.
     2.5.1.1.2.6. (Added-11WG) The FAMs will develop/tailor checklists and conduct
     inspections with the UCIPMs, as needed. FAMs will provide a report to the UCIPM of all
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                     17


              discrepancies, date of discovery, recommended corrective actions, and estimated comple-
              tion date. Discrepancies that can be corrected on the spot need not be reported.
                  2.5.1.1.2.6.1. (Added-11WG) As a minimum, FAMs will maintain the following for
                  review by the UCIPM, supervisor or unit commander: continuity binder IAW this sup-
                  plement, an up-to-date self-inspection checklist, information on open inspection dis-
                  crepancies and corrective actions, and any external inspection reports (or portions of
                  reports) applicable to the subject matter area of the work center.
                  2.5.1.1.2.6.2. (Added-11WG) The FAMs will serve as the OPR for SIIs as desig-
                  nated by Group or Squadron Commanders or Director of Staff. Validate unit responses,
                  accomplish the wing-level SII report, coordinate through appropriate leadership, and
                  submit to 11 WG/IGI no later than the suspense date set by the SII.
           2.5.1.1.3. (Added-11WG) Continuity Binder
              2.5.1.1.3.1. (Added-11WG) Continuity Binders will require, as a minimum, the follow-
              ing sections and documentation:
SECTION 1 - Appointment Memorandums will be available for the manager/monitor and immediate sub-
ordinates, GCIPM has appointment memorandums for self and their UCIPMs.


SECTION 2 - Unit/Group/Wing Commander’s Policy Letters.


SECTION 3 - Directives (AFI 90-201) Inspector General Activities, WGSI 90-201Compliance Inspection
Program.

SECTION 5 - All inspection results to include SII inspections and inspections preparing for HHQ inspec-
tions.


SECTION 6 – Summary/Status Reports of discrepancies, corrective action plans and critical findings
briefed to the Wing Commander.


SECTION 7 - Trend Analysis. Trend analysis information will be extracted for the WACS program.


SECTION 8 - Training Records. Training records should be available for the unit manager/monitors at all
times.


SECTION 9 - Reports from audits, SAVs, or inspections of the unit conducted by external organizations,
i.e. ORI, UCI, and SAV.
18                                                             AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008



SECTION 10 - Miscellaneous. HQ USAF Inspection Guides, TIG Brief extracts, Crosstells, local inspec-
tions, and inspection reports and trend analysis from other units.
              2.5.1.1.3.2. (Added-11WG) Due to the volume of documentation required, documents
              required in Sections 5, 8, 9, and 10 can be stored in external files. Cross-reference the loca-
              tion in the continuity binder.
              2.5.1.1.3.3. (Added-11WG) Disposition Guidance. Retain continuity binder files and
              documentation in accordance with AFI 90-201 and 11th Wing Supplements.
                 2.5.1.1.3.3.1. (Added-11WG) HQ USAF inspection guides, TIG Brief extracts,
                 crosstells, and other miscellaneous information. Purge six months after own compara-
                 ble inspection report or when no longer needed, whichever is sooner.
                 2.5.1.1.3.3.2. (Added-11WG) Local Wing Inspections. Purge after completion of
                 trend analysis or when corrective actions are completed.
                 2.5.1.1.3.3.3. (Added-11WG) HHQ Inspections (ORI, UCI, SAV, etc.). Purge one
                 year after all corrective actions have been completed or after completion of trend anal-
                 ysis with next inspection, whichever is later.
                 2.5.1.1.3.3.4. (Added-11WG) Audit Reports. Purge after two years of report date,
                 provided corrective actions are completed.
                 2.5.1.1.3.3.5. (Added-11WG) Self-Inspection Reports. Keep all reports for previous
                 12 months.
                 2.5.1.1.3.3.6. (Added-11WG) SII Inspection Reports. Keep one year after SII
                 becomes inactive.
                 2.5.1.1.3.3.7. (Added-11WG) Trend Analysis Information. Keep current version.
          2.5.1.1.4. (Added-11WG) Self-Inspection Checklists
              2.5.1.1.4.1. (Added-11WG) Self-Inspection checklists are provided per AFIs, other
              appropriate HHQ checklists, or unit tailored checklists. Functional area checklists can be
              downloaded from AETC or AFIA to be included in the WACS data base. Tailor checklists
              as appropriate to wing function. Include critical and non- critical inspection items. Add,
              delete or modify checklists items as required to meet mission requirements. Commander
              should certify that the checklist(s) will provide an accurate measure of required unit per-
              formance.
              2.5.1.1.4.2. (Added-11WG) If checklists are not available or cannot be tailored for unit
              or work centers, FAMs must query similar units at other bases. If there are no checklists for
              your unit, develop checklists as required. Divide checklist questions into two categories –
              critical and non-critical – using definitions of “critical findings” and “non-critical find-
              ings” provided in Attachment 1 to this instruction. Critical questions should be bolded.
          2.5.1.1.5. (Added-11WG) Self-Inspection Process.
              2.5.1.1.5.1. (Added-11WG) In preparation for each self-inspection, refer to appropriate
              AFIs for guidance in answering inspection checklists. Mark each checklist question with a
              check in either the “In Compliance, In Compliance w/ Comments, Not in Compliance, or
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                   19


           N/A”. If the answer to the checklist question is “In Compliance”, the written explanation
           and/or documentation should be sufficient to convince the reviewer that the unit is in com-
           pliance. If the answer to the checklist question is N/A there should be sufficient written
           justification that this question does not apply. If the answer to the checklist question is
           “Not in Compliance” or “In Compliance w/ Comments”, then fully document the discrep-
           ancy. The problem should be explained as well as what corrective action is being taken or
           identify the discrepancy as a LIMFAC to be forwarded to HHQ for resolution.
           2.5.1.1.5.2. (Added-11WG) Checklist items answered “In Compliance” will be consid-
           ered CLOSED; items answered “Not in Compliance” or “In Compliance w/ Comments”
           will be considered OPEN and called a discrepancy. In the situation where there is a
           two-part question on the checklist, if either part is Not in Compliance then the overall
           checklist item is considered OPEN.
        2.5.1.1.6. (Added-11WG) OPSEC.
           2.5.1.1.6.1. (Added-11WG) Consider the wing, squadron, and functional area Critical
           Information List (located in each squadron’s OPSEC binder) in the development, marking,
           and coordination of all wing inspection documentation. Ensure effective control of sensi-
           tive information at all levels of the inspection and review process. Document disposal must
           be made in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. Prevent unautho-
           rized disclosure of critical information by shredding all 11 WG inspection documents, and
           sensitive inspection documentation from other units when no longer needed.
        2.5.1.1.7. (Added-11WG) WING AUTOMATED CHECKLIST SYSTEM (WACS). The
        Wing Automated Checklist System has been implemented to assist the 11th Wing to fulfill the
        requirements of the Compliance Inspection Program (CIP). WACS provides a mechanism to
        track the status of all wing CIP checklist items through a web based program. Inspection
        checklists are broken down into four different categories: Comply, Non-Comply, Comply w/
        Comments and Non-Applicable (N/A).
           2.5.1.1.7.1. (Added-11WG) WACS Database. Read the entire question as it appears in
           WACS and ensure ALL elements are correctly answered. If uncertain about the described
           requirements/tasking, refer to the published guidance, i.e., AF Instructions, Policies or
           DoD Directives for clarification.
               2.5.1.1.7.1.1. (Added-11WG) Determine the compliance status, e.g., Comply,
               Non-Comply, or Comply with Comments. Apply the WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN
               and WHY rule when answering checklist questions. Ask yourself, WHO performed the
               task; WHAT actions were taken to correct the deficiency; WHERE is the supporting
               documentation: HOW does this process ensure compliance is maintained. Overall,
               comments should either prove compliance or explain actions taken to correct deficien-
               cies.
               2.5.1.1.7.1.2. (Added-11WG) Assign an Estimated Completion Date (ECD) to
               “Non-Comply” or “Comply w/ Comment” questions. ECDs should reflect “BEST”
               estimate for completion.
               2.5.1.1.7.1.3. (Added-11WG) Date and initial ALL actions/status changes to the
               “RESPONSE” block in WACS. This is a record of actions taken to ensure compliance.
20                                                               AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


                    In addition, it will help serve to identify future CIP Monitors of information to track
                    compliance issues. System will only track the latest date and author.
            2.5.1.1.8. (Added-11WG) WACS TRAINING
                2.5.1.1.8.1. (Added-11WG) Training slides are located on the 11 WG intranet homep-
                age. Click on the following hyperlinks in this order: Organizations, Wing Staff, Inspector
                General, Services, and Inspections.
            2.5.1.1.9. (Added-11WG) Gatekeeper Program
                2.5.1.1.9.1. (Added-11WG) 11th Wing Gatekeeper Program responsibilities have been
                delegated to the CIP. The CIP will monitor and de-conflict, to the extent practical, the type
                and amount of evaluation and assessment activity in the 11th Wing.
                2.5.1.1.9.2. (Added-11WG) Gatekeeper Responsibilities: Serve as the wing focal point
                for notification of Air Force level and non-Air Force evaluations, and assist the 11th Wing
                and Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) in deconflicting schedules as necessary.
                Gatekeeper will also relay visit notification to appropriate units. If attempts at de-conflict-
                ing fail, SAF/IGI may be requested to assist with external de-confliction.
     2.5.2. Weapons Safety Inspection (WSI). A WSI may be conducted as a subset of an ORI, CI, or NSI.
     Assess how the organization adheres to safety guidelines and procedures to include Occupational
     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and explosives safety standards (AFMAN 91-201, Explo-
     sives Safety Standards and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program and the instal-
     lation Comprehensive Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2).
        2.5.2.1. Inspect a statistically valid sampling of Air Force munitions/weapons facilities (e.g., stor-
        age, maintenance, flight line) and work areas. As a minimum include: Program Management
        (evaluate effectiveness and completeness of unit inspection documentation, staff training, com-
        mander involvement with risk assessment, security, safety violations and projected corrective
        actions), Task Proficiency (evaluate technical operations based on unit mission requirements,
        Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) taskings, emergency management, and support functions as
        applicable), and Explosive Safety (review explosive safety site plans to ensure explosives storage
        and maintenance facilities are properly sited; review waivers exemptions, and deviations IAW
        AFMAN 91-201).
     2.5.3. Federal Recognition Inspection (FRI). The gaining MAJCOM must make a federal recognition
     inspection of a state unit when the unit is being considered for federal recognition or when asked to do
     so by the National Guard Bureau (NGB). Conduct the FRI according to ANGI 90-201, Chapter 5. A
     FRI of a detachment is not needed if the parent unit is federally recognized. The FRI should include
     the unit and the detachment, if the detachment is part of a state unit to be federally recognized. As
     soon as a satisfactory FRI is complete on a unit, the gaining command assumes the responsibility
     assigned in AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of the Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces.

2.6. Inspection Scoring and Reporting. For NSIs, see Chapter 3. For ORIs, UCIs, and NORIs, use the
following guidelines for scoring and reporting inspection performance:
     2.6.1. Findings. Findings are validated deficiencies and will be tracked until closed out and assigned
     a cause code (see paragraph 2.6.3. below). In addition, assign one of the following deficiency levels
     to each finding:
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                                   21


                2.6.1.1. Critical Finding. Any deficiency that results or could result in widespread mission impact
                or failure. Critical deficiencies usually result in an “Unsatisfactory” or “Not in Compliance” rat-
                ing for the specific area and could result in an overall unit “Marginal,” “Unsatisfactory,” or “Not
                in Compliance” rating (for NSIs, see 3.5.1.2.1.1. for additional guidance). Critical findings will
                be closed out at MAJCOM level.
                2.6.1.2. Major Finding. Any deficiency that has or could have significant mission impact. The
                deficiency may cause a unit to be rated “Unsatisfactory” or “Not in Compliance” in one or more
                inspection areas (for NSIs, see 3.5.1.2.1.2. for additional guidance). Major findings will be closed
                out at MAJCOM level.
                2.6.1.3. Minor Finding. Any deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but has only modest mission
                impact. Minor deficiencies are tracked and closed out at the installation level.
   2.6.2. Recommended Improvement Area (RIA). An identified process, product, or capability which
   could be improved by a suggested course of action. An RIA is not a finding.
   2.6.3. Cause Codes. For SAF/IG data tracking purposes, all findings will be assigned a cause code in
   the inspection report. See Table 2.1. below for cause codes and explanations.

Table 2.1. Cause Codes and Explanations
 Category                                                         Root Cause

     via a separate memo with courtesy copy to both the tenant and host base units. Once notified, the own-
     ing MAJCOM IG will be responsible for status tracking and notifying the inspecting MAJCOM IG
     when corrective action is complete/finding resolved. (See para 3.8. for reporting, tracking and closure
     reporting of DTRA-identified NSI findings).
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                         23


2.7. Special Interest Item (SII) Program.
   2.7.1. Purpose. Air Force-level SIIs provide a means to focus management attention, gather data,
   and/ or evaluate the status of specific programs and conditions in the field. SIIs also provide feedback
   from the field that functional staffs use to enhance decision-making and policy adjustments. Active
   Air Force-level SIIs should not exceed more than five at any given time.
   2.7.2. Responsibilities.
       2.7.2.1. SAF/IGI: Manage the SII program, coordinate SII topic proposals, and obtain SAF/IG
       approval. Following approval, distribute to MAJCOM IGs and AFIA, correlate returned data, pre-
       pare SII reports (RCS: SAF-IG(AR)0008) as required, and forward these reports through SAF/IG
       to the sponsoring agency.
       2.7.2.2. SII Sponsors: Identify potential Air Force-wide SII topics and submit topic proposals to
       SAF/IGI at safigi@pentagon.af.mil or DSN 225-1531. Proposals may be submitted by sponsors
       at any level, however, MAJCOM or HQ DCS coordination is required prior to formal submission.
       See paragraph 2.7.3. for SII format.
       2.7.2.3. MAJCOM/NGB IGs and AFIA: Ensure that MAJCOM-level SIIs do not conflict with
       Air Force-level SIIs. Upon request from SAF/IGI, provide feedback on the perceived value, need,
       and inspectability of SII topic proposals. In lieu of specific instructions to the contrary, comply
       with the following general guidance:
          2.7.2.3.1. SII Inspections: MAJCOM IGs and AFIA should inspect all active SIIs during each
          formal inspection. IG remarks are important to the SII process and should be annotated IAW
          specific instructions attached to each SII.
          2.7.2.3.2. SII Reports: MAJCOM IGs and AFIA will document the results of SII inspections
          as a separate section of the evaluation/inspection report or as a stand-alone report. MAJCOM
          IGs and AFIA will forward consolidated quarterly and final reports to SAF/IGI at safigi@pen-
          tagon.af.mil. These consolidated reports should include unit inspected, location, date of
          inspection, a copy of the inspection checklist results for each inspected unit, and an extract of
          the SII portion of each inspected unit’s inspection report. SAF/IGI will then consolidate these
          MAJCOM inputs and forward to the SII Sponsor.
       2.7.2.4. Wing/unit personnel: Obtain SII information via MAJCOM IG or SAF/IGI at http://
       www.ig.hq.af.mil/igi/index.htm, or safigi@pentagon.af.mil, as needed. Wings/units not
       inspected during the active period of this SII will conduct a one-time self-inspection and report
       results to their MAJCOM IG for their fourth quarterfinal report. FOA/DRU units not scheduled
       for an inspection during the active period of an SII will report their results to AFIA.
   2.7.3. Format. Upon request, SAF/IGI will provide potential sponsors with additional information on
   the purposes and uses of Air Force-level SIIs, an initial assessment of each topic proposal’s applicabil-
   ity, and assistance crafting and coordinating the formal proposal. Submit SII topic proposals in the fol-
   lowing format:
       2.7.3.1. Subject and POCs. Specify the proposed title of the SII and include the name, rank,
       office, and DSN phone number for each of the SII’s sponsors.
       2.7.3.2. Purpose. Provide a clear, concise statement of the SII’s goals and objectives.
24                                                             AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


        2.7.3.3. SII Category. Identify the category requested (i.e., long-term or short-term). A long-term
        SII is normally active for one year (may be extended on a case-by-case basis). Long-term SIIs are
        used when an issue is pervasive and is of major importance Air Force-wide or when evaluating
        compliance in a specific area. A short-term SII is normally active less than one year. Short-term
        SIIs are used when an issue has a limited scope. In some cases, these issues may be analyzed from
        past inspection data or from results of a one-time survey or unit self-assessment. In the case of a
        one-time unit self-assessment, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU IGs should validate unit results during each
        inspection that occurs while the SII is active.
        2.7.3.4. Background and Rationale. Provide sufficient background information to give inspectors
        an insight into the problem and include the rationale (i.e., the reason the SII is needed) behind the
        SII.
        2.7.3.5. Inspection Guidance. Identify a start date and end date to frame the time the SII will be
        active. Specify grading criteria. Normally, a simplified grading scale (e.g., SATISFACTORY/
        UNSATISFACTORY) is appropriate. Include precise criteria inspectors will use to determine
        grades, based on the sponsor-provided inspection guide. Clearly identify any critical criteria (fail-
        ure of criteria is an overall UNSATISFACTORY).
        2.7.3.6. Reporting Guidance. SAF/IGI will establish the specific instructions for the MAJCOM/
        FOA/DRU IG SII reports.
        2.7.3.7. SII Inspection Guides. Include a comprehensive inspection guide for units to apply in
        self-inspections and MAJCOM/FOA/DRU IGs to inspect the SII topic. This guide should include
        specific questions and procedures for evaluating the topic. Ensure that compliance-oriented ques-
        tions are solidly grounded in specific regulatory guidance (e.g., DoDI, AFI, etc.) and include the
        applicable reference with each question.

2.8. Air Force Inspector’s Course. SAF/IGI is responsible for the content of and conducting the Air
Force Inspector’s Course. The Inspectors Course provides the SAF/IG perspective on the inspection pro-
cess. The course is designed primarily for newly assigned MAJCOM IG team members, but other MAJ-
COM-level inspectors and unit-level Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) members can attend on a
space-available basis. Additional information regarding the Inspectors Course may be obtained at DSN
225-1531, safigi@pentagon.af.mil, or http://www.ig.hq.af.mil/igi/index.htm.
     2.8.1. MAJCOM IGs are responsible for the content and conducting their command specific (or
     inspection-specific) training that addresses unique aspects of their mission, with an emphasis on
     safety. MAJCOM IG team members should receive the Air Force Inspectors Course (and any special-
     ized team, functional area, host-nation or MAJCOM-specific training, if applicable) prior to conduct-
     ing an inspection.

2.9. Inspection Report Handling.
     2.9.1. Classification. Inspectors must mark unclassified reports and portions of reports "For Official
     Use Only" (FOUO) if they contain FOUO information (AF Supplement to DOD Regulation
     5400.7-R, DOD Freedom of Information Act Program). Mark reports containing classified informa-
     tion as prescribed by DOD Regulation 5200.1-R, DOD Information Security Program, and AFI
     31-401, Information Security Program Management.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                        25


   2.9.2. Releasability. Reports of inspection are privileged documents and the Air Force controls their
   distribution. The following statement must appear on the cover and in the body of each report: “For
   Official Use Only. This report/electronic transmission contains internal matters that are deliberative
   in nature, are part of the agency decision-making process, and/or are otherwise legally privileged,
   each of which are protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552. Do
   not release in whole or part to persons or agencies outside of the Air Force, nor can it be republished
   in whole or part in any publication not containing this statement, including Air Force magazines and
   general use pamphlets, without express approval of the Director, SAF/IGI. If you received this mes-
   sage/document in error, please notify the sender by reply e-mail and delete all copies of this message.”
   Include similar statements on reports of inspections conducted jointly with inspection teams from
   DoD agencies. Requests from outside DoD should be accomplished through the FOIA process.
      2.9.2.1. Reports may be released in whole or part within DoD at MAJCOM/IG discretion. Sum-
      mary inspection results may be released for inclusion in base and local newspapers. Contact SAF/
      IGI for approval to release reports in whole or part outside DoD.
      2.9.2.2. MAJCOM IGs will maintain a record of official requests for inspection reports. All
      inspection reports marked in accordance with paragraph 2.9.2. will be maintained IAW the
      AFRIMS, Records Disposition Schedule (https://afrims.amc.af.mil/). Records should be
      destroyed IAW DoD Regulation 5400.7-R for FOUO material and IAW AFI 31-401 for classified
      material.
      2.9.2.3. Commanders will ensure the privileged status of inspection reports is protected.
      2.9.2.4. See paragraph 4.7. for additional guidance concerning AFIA reports.
   2.9.3. Distribution: Within two weeks of the completion of all inspection reports, send an electronic
   version to either the UNCLAS e-mail safigi@pentagon.af.mil or CLASSIFIED (up to SECRET)
   e-mail to safigi@af.pentagon.smil.mil. In cases where electronic distribution is inappropriate, mail
   a hard copy to SAF/IGI at 1500 Wilson Blvd, Suite 110, Rosslyn, VA 22209-2404. Availability of
   reports on internet sites does not satisfy this requirement.

2.10. Inspection Scheduling and Coordination.
   2.10.1. Inspectors General will identify a trusted agent authorized to release close hold, no-notice
   inspection schedules to AFIA/CC. AFIA/CC publishes the combined inspection schedule quarterly.
   Personnel assigned to the SAF/IGI, AFIA, and AFSC/SEW staffs are designated as trusted agents.
   Trusted agents will not divulge information to unauthorized personnel. Commanders at all levels must
   ensure the integrity of the trusted agent system.
   2.10.2. MAJCOM IG teams coordinate with MAJCOM Gatekeepers, headquarters staffs, AFIA, and
   the Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) to ensure staff assistance visits (SAVs), audit schedules, and top-
   ics do not duplicate or conflict with inspection schedules or topics. AFIA and AFAA will coordinate
   centrally directed audits and inspection topics to avoid duplication of effort. For ARC units, MAJ-
   COM IGs will coordinate their inspection schedule, frequency, etc. with ARC IGs.
   2.10.3. Commanders and staffs notify IG teams of schedule conflicts based on operational or exercise
   taskings.
   2.10.4. Commanders ensure key management personnel are on duty and available to DOD IG, AFIA,
   or other established IG team inspectors.

2.11. Gatekeeper Functions.
     2.11.1. SAF/IGI, MAJCOM, and NGB Gatekeepers monitor and deconflict, to the extent practical,
     the type and amount of evaluation activity in Air Force units.
     2.11.2. SAF/IGI Gatekeeper Responsibilities. Serve as the Air Force focal point for notification of
     Air Force-level and non-Air Force evaluations and assist MAJCOM/NGB Gatekeepers in deconflict-
     ing schedules, as necessary. Relay visit notifications to appropriate MAJCOM/NGB Gatekeepers and
     publish AF Gatekeeper guidance.
     2.11.3. MAJCOM and NGB Gatekeeper Responsibilities. Establish a Gatekeeper program.
        2.11.3.1. Monitor all evaluation visits to installations to deconflict schedules and minimize
        impact on field units. MAJCOM Gatekeepers do not have authority to deny access to inspectors/
        auditors from agencies outside their MAJCOM. If attempts at deconfliction fail, SAF/IGI may
        assist with external deconfliction. Through authority delegated by the Director, Air National
        Guard, NGB IG is the OPR for deconflicting gaining-MAJCOM inspection activity with other
        ANG taskings.
        2.11.3.2. Evaluate inspection visit requests to determine if visits are duplicative to on-going or
        recent efforts of other agencies.

2.12. Best Practices. MAJCOM IGs and AFIA inspectors will record observed Best Practices as an
unclassified addendum to all inspection reports. Best Practices are designated by the inspection team chief
based on coordination with appropriate MAJCOM functional experts. Do not include the privileged doc-
ument statement on these records, as they will be releasable both within and outside the Air Force unless
otherwise directed. Upon validation, send Best Practices to Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) IAW

               AIR FORCE NUCLEAR SURETY INSPECTION (NSI) PROGRAM

3.1. NSI Program Guidance . Nuclear weapon systems require special consideration because of their
political and military importance, their destructive power, and the potential consequences of an accident
or unauthorized act. When inspecting a nuclear-capable unit, inspection teams follow the inspection pro-
cedures in this instruction, in addition to guidance contained in TO 11N-25-1. Each unit's management of
nuclear resources will be evaluated against approved safety, security, and reliability standards. To provide
a single source of consolidated inspection guidance, this paragraph combines USAF inspection require-
ments with DoD guidance extracted from TO 11N-25-1. An annotation [USAF] is included at the end of
each subparagraph containing DoD guidance that has been amplified or modified to meet specific USAF
requirements.
   3.1.1. Final ratings will be based on the guidance in TO 11N-25-1, Section 3.
   3.1.2. Evaluate logistics airlift units with nuclear weapons transport missions by observing loading,
   transporting, unloading, and custody transfer procedures of representative types of weapons. The team
   should conduct the inspection (other than an Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection) during missions
   involving war reserve (WR) weapons when available. The inspection team will not require the unit to
   perform additional weapon handling operations if a WR mission is evaluated and rated at least “Satis-
   factory.”
   3.1.3. During an inspection, do not use an inspector as part of a unit's Two-Person Concept team (see
   AFI 91-104, Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs). During airlift missions and
   when unescorted entry to restricted areas is authorized, two properly cleared inspectors certified under
   the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) may form their own Two-Person Concept team.
   3.1.4. Whenever possible, evaluate a unit's technical proficiency by using WR weapons due at the
   time of the inspection for normal maintenance, loading, unloading, or logistics movement. Training
   weapons or weapon system simulators will be used for inspections when WR assets are not available,
   when WR weapons are specifically forbidden by Weapon System Safety Rules, DoD, CJCS, or MAJ-
   COM directives, or when reinspection is required following unit decertification. In cases where train-
   ing weapons or weapon system simulators are used for inspection purposes, they will be treated as
   WR while under evaluation.
   3.1.5. Include in the NSI report all deficiencies that directly affect the safety, security, or reliability of
   a nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon system.

3.2. Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI). The INSI is designed to evaluate a unit's readiness to
assume or resume a nuclear mission. It is used to evaluate and certify new or significantly modified main-
tenance and storage facilities, physical security systems or equipment to include lethal and non-lethal
denial systems or to evaluate a unit’s readiness following significant changes to weapons systems or por-
tions thereof (see Attachment 2). In all cases, the MAJCOM/SEW office working with concerned func-
tionals and in coordination with AFSC/SEW will determine if an INSI is required and document that
decision in a memo to the unit(s) to be inspected, the MAJCOM IG and affected staff functionals. The
memo will list the specific areas subject to evaluation during the INSI. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
will be certified in accordance with the AF Supplement to DoD S-5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security
Manual. MAJCOMs determine who, within the MAJCOM staff organization (SF or IG), performs recer-
28                                                               AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


tification tests required by DoD 5210.41M. In every case, use training weapons to conduct an INSI before
WR weapons are placed at the unit or facility. An INSI will be rated “Ready” or “Not Ready.”
     3.2.1. The inspection team evaluates a unit's capability to safely and reliably receive, store, transport,
     secure, maintain, load, mate, lock/unlock, and render safe nuclear weapons or reentry systems. Air-
     crews, command post controllers, release teams, and missile launch crews must demonstrate their
     knowledge of weapon acceptance procedures, nuclear weapon system safety rules, and nuclear
     weapon control order handling and authentication procedures. The inspection team also examines
     plans and resources for implementing an advanced readiness posture.
     3.2.2. Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams and nuclear logistics airlift units must receive an
     INSI “Ready” rating before being considered capable of supporting a nuclear mission.
     3.2.3. Phased INSIs may be conducted for large-scale, time-consuming efforts. If phased INSIs are
     conducted, the responsible MAJCOM prepares an inspection plan to make sure all required areas are
     initially inspected and sends it to HQ AFSC/SEW for approval. A “Ready” rating must be achieved
     for the phase of the INSI under evaluation before evaluating the next phase. All phases must be rated
     “Ready” prior to assuming nuclear operations. If a phased INSI is conducted and each phase is rated
     “Ready,” the required maximum 18-month period between NSIs starts on the completion date of the
     first phase.

3.3. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). The NSI is designed to evaluate a unit's capability to manage
nuclear resources while complying with all nuclear surety standards (see applicable areas listed in para-
graph 3.5.2.). An NSI may be combined with other MAJCOM inspections to reduce the number of unit
inspections. Where two or more MAJCOMs share nuclear surety responsibilities at one base, multi-MAJ-
COM NSIs (MMNSI) are encouraged to ensure host-tenant responsibilities are fully assessed and prop-
erly integrated. Either the host or tenant MAJCOM may perform these inspections with the concurrence
of, and augmentation from, the other MAJCOM. Additionally, DTRA, IAW TO 11N-25-1, conducts Joint
Nuclear Surety Inspections (JNSIs) on AF units with MAJCOM IG teams.
     3.3.1. Frequency of MAJCOM NSIs.
        3.3.1.1. Conduct an NSI of each nuclear-capable unit at least every 18 months. Complete all
        inspection requirements within 18 months after completing the last NSI. Complete all phases
        within a 120-calendar-day period. Provide the NSI rating when all phases are completed.
            3.3.1.1.1. If a unit does not meet the 18-month inspection requirement and is not granted a
            waiver, they will be decertified. MAJCOM commanders will ensure nuclear weapons are
            maintained in a safe, secure, and reliable environment until the unit is recertified. Recertifica-
            tion will be accomplished by conducting an INSI.
            3.3.1.1.2. Units may be selected at the discretion of the MAJCOM IG to receive a mini-
            mum-notice inspection that will key on a unit’s ability to perform its nuclear surety mission.
            Notice will be sent by message to units with information copies to SAF/IG, HQ AFIA/IO, HQ
            AFSC/SEW, HQ USAF/SEI, HQ USAF/A3SN, HQ USAF/A7S, and HQ USAF/A4M.
        3.3.1.2. Conduct a follow-up NSI 90 to 180 calendar days after a new unit successfully completes
        an INSI and receives nuclear weapons. EOD teams, nuclear airlift units, and certification of new
        or modified facilities do not require this follow-up NSI.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                          29


       3.3.1.3. Waiver. Waivers should be the last resort after all other avenues have been exhausted; i.e.
       conduct NSI earlier than planned or combine with another inspection when applicable. Waiver
       requests will originate from the responsible MAJCOM/CV to SAF/IG. If SAF/IG concurs, the
       waiver request will be appropriately staffed and forwarded for CJCS approval.

3.4. Limited Nuclear Surety Inspection (LNSI). The LNSI is limited in scope and does not evaluate all
NSI areas applicable to the unit. It is conducted for a variety of reasons and does not alter the 18-month
NSI requirement.
   3.4.1. MAJCOMs conduct LNSIs to:
       3.4.1.1. Inspect one or more areas designated by the MAJCOM CC or IG.
       3.4.1.2. Reinspect a unit in any area that was rated “UNSATISFACTORY” or “SUPPORT
       UNSATISFACTORY” during an NSI. Note: The rating for a reinspected area cannot exceed
       “SATISFACTORY.”
       3.4.1.3. Contingency Nuclear Mission Units. Certify a unit with a nuclear contingency mission
       before deployment IAW Attachment 2.

3.5. Nuclear Inspection Criteria and Areas. Nuclear inspection criteria and areas are designed to
address all functional areas or operations related to the unit’s nuclear mission. During LNSIs and INSIs,
selected areas may be inspected.
   3.5.1. Pass/Fail Criteria. Consider carefully all NSI pass/fail criteria when assessing any deficiency
   (see TO 11N-25-1, Section 3). In general, deficiencies resulting in an “UNSATISFACTORY” must be
   directly related to an existing condition that creates the credible possibility of compromising safety,
   security, or reliability of nuclear system.
       3.5.1.1. Areas rated “UNSATISFACTORY” under pass/fail criteria may be reinspected prior to
       inspection team departure. If the area is not reinspected to at least a “MARGINAL” level, the
       inspected unit must discontinue that portion of the operation until reinspected or corrective mea-
       sures are implemented and approved by the MAJCOM commander pending reinspection. [USAF]
       3.5.1.2. Inspection Scoring and Reporting. Use the following guidelines for scoring and reporting
       NSI performance:
           3.5.1.2.1. Findings. Assign one of the following deficiency levels to each finding:
               3.5.1.2.1.1. Critical Deficiency. Any deficiency resulting in, or meeting the criteria for, an
               “UNSATISFACTORY” condition as defined in TO 11N-25-1, Section 3-2.2.
               3.5.1.2.1.2. Major Deficiency. A deficiency that requires immediate, answerable action by
               the unit or higher agency to prevent an unreliable weapon, or unsafe or insecure environ-
               ment. The deficiency may cause a unit to be rated “Unsatisfactory” in one or more inspec-
               tion areas not defined as critical under overall unit pass/fail criteria.
               3.5.1.2.1.3. Minor Deficiency. Any deficiency that does not meet the definition of a criti-
               cal or major deficiency.
           3.5.1.2.2. Recommended Improvement Area (RIA). An identified process, product, or capa-
           bility that could be improved by a suggested course of action. A RIA is not a finding.
30                                                             AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


        3.5.1.3. Cause Codes. For SAF/IG, AFIA/IO, and AFSC/SEW data tracking purposes, all find-
        ings will be assigned a cause code in the inspection report. See Table 2.1. for cause codes and
        explanations.
            3.5.1.3.1. Oversight. Errors in leadership or supervision at any level.
            3.5.1.3.2. Experience. Errors committed despite adequate training, oversight, and guidance.
            3.5.1.3.3. Guidance. Inadequate, confusing, or specific written direction that is contradictory
            or prevents adequate accomplishment of the task.
            3.5.1.3.4. Training. Individuals inadequately trained/prepared to accomplish the task.
            3.5.1.3.5. Equipment. Support equipment unavailable, inadequate, or inoperable due to cir-
            cumstances beyond the unit’s control. Problems within the unit’s control would fall under one
            of the other areas.
            3.5.1.3.6. Other. Isolated events involving deficient actions of individuals not attributable to
            any of the previous causes.
     3.5.2. Nuclear Inspection Areas. An “UNSATISFACTORY” rating in one of the following areas
     does not automatically result in an overall unit rating of “UNSATISFACTORY” unless it violates the
     pass/fail criteria.
        3.5.2.1. MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.
            3.5.2.1.1. Management. Evaluate leadership, guidance, communication, and attitude of unit
            commander and key supervisors. Determine whether deficiencies are the result of individual
            error or reflect management or supervisory shortcomings. [USAF]
            3.5.2.1.2. Administration. Evaluate:
               3.5.2.1.2.1. Required up-to-date directives and technical publications applicable to the
               scope of the NSI in accordance with this manual. A check shall be made to ensure that
               changes are being received and posted, and the unit is not in receipt of unauthorized publi-
               cations pertaining to nuclear weapons.
               3.5.2.1.2.2. Unit Standard Operating Procedures/Plans/Instructions implementing DOD
               and USAF requirements in the areas of security, safety, nuclear accident/incident response,
               non-violent disablement, emergency evacuation, supply support, and logistic movement,
               as required.
               3.5.2.1.2.3. An organizational listing of personnel assigned nuclear weapons duties,
               including security forces. This listing will be used in conjunction with inspection of the
               unit to ensure that the unit can safely and securely carry out the assigned nuclear weapons
               mission.
               3.5.2.1.2.4. The control and handling of classified plans, manuals, records, reports, and
               components directly associated with the scope of the NSI, to include verifiable control pro-
               cedures (VCP) for permissive action link and other designated coding equipment.
               3.5.2.1.2.5. Required records properly maintained and evidence of timely submission of
               reports pertaining to nuclear weapons.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                      31


           3.5.2.1.2.6. Accountability and/or custody records, to include courier receipts, shipping
           documents and records of audit. Designation in writing of accountable and/or custodial
           officers and verifying officers. Stockpile reporting to include Weapon Status Reports
           (WSRs), Semi-annual Inventory Reports (SIRs), etc.
           3.5.2.1.2.7. Existing host-tenant agreements to determine their adequacy and to ensure
           they support the efficient execution of the unit’s nuclear weapons mission, including the
           Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS) liaison officer. [USAF]
           3.5.2.1.2.8. Unit training to be based upon the performance of the unit in the areas of tech-
           nical operations, storage, maintenance, safety, security, and logistic movement. If deficien-
           cies exist, a detailed inspection may be made to determine the extent to which training
           contributes to the deficiency(ies). This inspection point shall not be construed as a require-
           ment for the generation of records not already required by pertinent Service or major com-
           mand regulations.
           3.5.2.1.2.9. Key and Lock Control to include designation in writing, key inventory, audit
           and transfer procedures, maintenance, and disposition.
           3.5.2.1.2.10. Status of approved waivers, exemptions, deviations, and exceptions. [USAF]
           3.5.2.1.2.11. Loading and management to include loading standardization, certification,
           training programs and schedules, adequacy of maintenance plans, and, for certain non-US
           delivery aircraft, status, certification procedures and records. [USAF]
           3.5.2.1.2.12. Reentry system mating management to include standardization, training and
           certification programs, and maintenance plans as required. [USAF]
     3.5.2.2. TECHNICAL OPERATIONS. Evaluate each type of assigned weapon to assess safety,
     reliability and technical performance.
        3.5.2.2.1. The unit or activity shall be prepared to demonstrate each technical operation
        required to accomplish its nuclear weapons mission. Table 2-3 of TO11N-25-1 lists areas sub-
        ject to inspection during the technical operations portions of NSIs and shall be used by NSI
        teams to ensure sufficient functional area coverage of technical operations and the readiness of
        war reserve nuclear weapons. A limited number of operations specified in Table 2-3 may be
        omitted at the discretion of the team chief or chief inspector when essential; for example, due
        to operational requirements, area or facility limitations, or other managerial considerations.
        When units are unable to demonstrate areas to be inspected and operational commitments
        afford the opportunity, the unit to be inspected shall notify the inspecting organization of the
        problem or problems through the USAF organization responsible for scheduling the inspec-
        tion. This notification will be made as soon as the problem is known to permit rescheduling of
        the inspection if necessary. A notation of the omission or omissions will be included in the
        inspection report.
        3.5.2.2.2. Units having a multiple weapon capability may not be required to demonstrate a
        complete operation for each area listed in the tables if some of the operations are comparable.
        3.5.2.2.3. If training weapons are used, operations must be performed in a safe and secure
        environment in the same manner as on war reserve weapons. Because of differences between
        some war reserve weapons and corresponding training items, units using training weapons
        during NSIs often must perform procedures not required with war reserve weapons. Inspectors
32                                                          AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


        must ensure deficiencies noted during the operations with training items would have occurred
        if the unit had been working with war reserve weapons. When a trainer is simulated to be war
        reserve, for the purpose of the inspection, it is war reserve. If the trainer does not meet war
        reserve standards and in fact is in reject condition, the inspected team shall so identify it; the
        inspector may then simulate that the deficiency has been corrected and the inspection may
        continue.
        3.5.2.2.4. The operations shall be clearly divided between those conducted under peacetime
        conditions and those conducted under wartime conditions, and shall be organized so there will
        be no confusion on the part of the inspected unit when the transition from one phase to the
        other occurs.
        3.5.2.2.5. Certain operations listed individually in Table 2-3 of TO 11N-25-1 may be com-
        bined with or be an integral part of other operations. For example, receipt inspections or veri-
        fication inspections do not always require starting from or ending with a specific
        configuration. Inspectors approve the starting/ending configuration before the task starts.
        3.5.2.2.6. Loading and Mating. Evaluate:
            3.5.2.2.6.1. Ability to safely and reliably load aircraft, to include loading and mating,
            weapons transfer, upload operations, post upload procedures, trailer to weapons mate (if
            certified) and single weapon exchange. [USAF]
            3.5.2.2.6.2. Weapon release system. For custodial units supporting non-US delivery orga-
            nizations, include the US technical load monitor activity. [USAF]
        3.5.2.2.7. Reentry System Mating in Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Units. Evaluate team
        adherence to technical data and overall safety and reliability of each assigned weapon system
        type. [USAF]
     3.5.2.3. TOOLS, TEST, TIEDOWN AND HANDLING EQUIPMENT. Tools, test, tiedown, and
     handling equipment shall be inspected for adequacy, condition, nuclear certification, proper mark-
     ing, calibration status, and load test, as applicable. [USAF]
     3.5.2.4. STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE FACILITIES AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK-
     PILE. The following areas will be inspected.
        3.5.2.4.1. Examine at least 50 percent of the assets in igloo storage and at least 25 percent of
        assets in depot and weapon storage vaults. Conduct spot inspections of weapons coded for
        retirement to ensure they are stored in a safe condition and are properly identified as being
        retired assets. [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.2. Weapons, Components, and Ancillary Equipment out of Containers. Inspection
        shall consist of questioning personnel and examining items in storage. Items shall not be
        moved or disassembled for the inspection except to the extent allowed for authorized mainte-
        nance.
        3.5.2.4.3. Weapons, Components, and Ancillary Equipment in Containers. Containers shall
        not be opened for the purpose of the inspection; however, when the state of maintenance of
        items or the condition or accuracy of records is suspect, the container shall be opened and a
        visual inspection of the item and records made. The determination to open containers shall be
        made by the team chief/senior technical inspector. The opening and resealing of containers
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                          33


        must be within the inspected unit’s capability or assistance must be requested from a support
        unit that has the capability. All seals shall be properly replaced if containers are opened. Con-
        dition and marking of containers shall be inspected whether or not they are opened.
        3.5.2.4.4. Weapons stored in a weapon storage and security system. The vault shall be opened
        to allow a full inspection of the weapons.
        3.5.2.4.5. Records associated with weapons, components, and ancillary equipment main-
        tained by the inspected unit.
        3.5.2.4.6. Compatibility of items stored or maintained.
        3.5.2.4.7. Observance of explosives and active material limits of items during storage, main-
        tenance, and transportation. [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.8. Adequacy of interior lighting.
        3.5.2.4.9. Adequacy of storage and maintenance structures.
        3.5.2.4.10. Condition of storage and maintenance structures and loading or launch facilities.
        [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.11. Roads in storage areas and between storage and loading or missile launch areas.
        [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.12. Ground support equipment. [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.13. Communications-computer systems. [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.14. Utilities. [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.15. Number and type of safety and explosive exceptions, waivers/deviations
        approved, and actions taken to eliminate conditions requiring exceptions or waivers/devia-
        tions.
        3.5.2.4.16. Nuclear certified hoists that are an integral part of the facility. Critical deficiencies
        include using lifting, handling, or tiedown equipment which is unserviceable, unauthorized, or
        has not received mandatory load testing or safety related inspections. [USAF]
        3.5.2.4.17. Lightning protection system, records, and demonstration of required system tests.
     3.5.2.5. Security. Primary emphasis during this portion of the inspection shall be to evaluate the
     unit’s ability to meet the Nuclear Weapons Security Standard (NWSS) outlined in DoD
     S-5210.41-M, as supplemented. Attachment 4 provides USAF guidance for NWSS evaluation to
     meet these requirements. Secondary inspection emphasis will focus on unit compliance with tech-
     nical criteria outlined in DoD S-5210.41-M, as supplemented. A sampling of areas and sub-areas
     in Attachment 4 shall be examined for compliance with applicable directives and by performance
     testing referencing Integrated Base Defense (IBD) activities and security standards outlined in the
     AF Supplement to DoD S-5210.41-M. Inspectors will use Attachment 4 as their sampling tool
     and guide in identifying areas for performance testing, compliance validation, and security exer-
     cises. Nuclear Weapon Security Exercise Evaluations. MAJCOMs perform a variety of inspec-
     tions to include NSIs, Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspections (NORI) etc, to evaluate a unit’s
     ability to meet the Nuclear Weapons Security Standard (NWSS). In applying the NWSS, this sec-
     tion pulls together requirements from DoD S-5210.41-M, Chapter 9 (including AF Supplement)
     and TO 11N-25-1, to provide a construct for such an evaluation. MAJCOMs will supplement this
34                                                          AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


     section to ensure their specific operating environments and elements of the published Defense
     Intelligence Agency (DIA) Nuclear Security Threat Capabilities Assessment (NSTCA)
     (2005-2015) are addressed while ensuring safe exercise conditions to meet exercise objectives.
        3.5.2.5.1. NWSS Exercise Inspection Methodology.
            3.5.2.5.1.1. MAJCOM IGs working with their staff functional counterparts will develop
            realistic nuclear weapon security exercise scenarios to determine a units' ability to meet the
            NWSS. These scenarios must be congruent with the localized threat environment as artic-
            ulated by the DIA NSTCA.
            3.5.2.5.1.2. Exercise Planning and Execution. For those inspections where a
            force-on-force (FoF) exercises is planned, MAJCOMs are responsible for sourcing suffi-
            cient Opposing Force (OPFOR) members and exercise controllers to conduct the exercise.
            The MAJCOM IG will determine the exercise scenario, and during a JNSI, will coordinate
            the scenario with DTRA/CSTI. Scenarios will specify the OPFOR size and capabilities
            and the IG will inform units of exercise requirements in writing at least 90 days prior to the
            inspection. OPFOR size and capabilities will not exceed the localized baseline scenarios
            outlined in the published DIA NSTCA, as it pertains to that installation. All OPFOR, exer-
            cise controllers, and IG trusted agents will be under the operational control of the inspect-
            ing IG.
            3.5.2.5.1.3. Exercise Scenarios. Where applicable, exercise scenarios will use an OPFOR
            that replicates adversaries identified in the published DIA NSTCA. Likewise, OPFOR
            capabilities will be matched as best as possible IAW this document to evaluate the unit’s
            integrated effort to meet the NWSS. Use of a simulated engagement system (e.g. MILES),
            while highly desired in the conduct of these exercises is optional. The following are min-
            imum expectations for security exercises:
               3.5.2.5.1.3.1. Operational risk management and safety procedures will be used in
               planning and execution of security exercises at all levels of command. Ensure distinct
               separation of exercise play area from real world mission areas using visual identifica-
               tion tools such as safety vest/belts, exercise controllers, safety briefings for trusted
               agents and normal exercise command and control communication announcements.
               When exercises are collocated within operational areas, be very careful not to use sce-
               narios that could be interpreted as an actual hostile situation that might cause acciden-
               tal injury to personnel or jeopardize the security of nuclear resources.
               3.5.2.5.1.3.2. Use areas in Attachment 4 as a guide to accomplish compliance valida-
               tion and to evaluate performance aspects of security exercises. Use of credible inspec-
               tion sampling techniques is recommended, as not all areas indicated need to be
               observed.
               3.5.2.5.1.3.3. At IG discretion, exercise scenarios resulting in the OPFOR gaining
               unauthorized access to nuclear weapons automatically triggers a recapture or recovery
               exercise, as applicable. Inspectors will ensure both the OPFOR and exercise control-
               lers know the “adversary intentions” for the planned attack (e.g. sabotage weapon,
               destruction, theft, etc).
               3.5.2.5.1.3.4. Participants will apply appropriate INFOSEC and OPSEC measures to
               safeguard exercise information, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Likewise,

               the results of exercises conducted in the context of NSIs, or other like inspections
               under the auspices of the IG will be appropriately classified, graded, critiqued, and
               reported for cross-tell purposes within the nuclear community.

        3.5.2.5.3. Performance-based Assessment Methodology. When measuring performance to
        determine whether a unit meets the NWSS, inspectors shall apply the following methodology
        during their observation:
           3.5.2.5.3.1. Observe and evaluate the integrated execution of security actions and
           responses (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable. Provide
           performance-based (SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY) grades for exercises by fac-
           toring:
               3.5.2.5.3.1.1. The timeliness/quality/strength of security/support force responses.
               (Did the unit meet the tenets of the NWSS (i.e. Deny access or regain custody)?
               3.5.2.5.3.1.2. Execution of applicable plans and TTPs. (Did the unit make sufficient
               effort to immediately deny access or regain custody?)
               3.5.2.5.3.1.3. Effect of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems, and
               other technology. (Did the unit use available options to prevent the loss of/deny access
               to nuclear weapons to the adversary to include destruction of the weapon?)
               3.5.2.5.3.1.4. Unit application of integrated base defense activities in the overall effort
               to meet the NWSS. (Did the unit bring available resources to bear on the event; e.g.,
               technology, TTPs, EOD, etc?)
36                                                      AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


        3.5.2.5.3.2. Determine the effect (outcome) of executed security action(s) and response
        (performance), in conjunction with the impact of unit compliance with technical criteria
        and contribution of supporting security systems, as applicable, (see Attachment 4) to
        determine if the NWSS was met. For example:
           3.5.2.5.3.2.1. Did the unit effectively execute applicable plans and employ sufficient
           forces in their effort to meet the NWSS?
           3.5.2.5.3.2.2. Was unit command and control effective?
           3.5.2.5.3.2.3. Did the unit up-channel information in sufficient detail and on time to
           appropriate higher headquarters agencies?
           3.5.2.5.3.2.4. Were unit TTPs and applied security technology effective in meeting the
           objective?
           3.5.2.5.3.2.5. Was unauthorized access denied or weapons custody regained.
        3.5.2.5.3.3. Exercise Grading Criteria. This area is rated using pass/fail criteria--see para-
        graph 3.5.1. A SATISFACTORY grade must be based on either successful denial or effec-
        tive and timely recapture/recovery of affected nuclear weapon(s). Failure of a unit to
        initially deny unauthorized access or subsequent loss of custody of nuclear weapons does
        not automatically result in a failing grade for exercises. In these cases, IGs must consider
        specific nuclear weapon type, site-specific physical delay/denial mechanisms, site topog-
        raphy, climate, location, and adversary objective, as well as the effort of the security/sup-
        port force to disrupt/delay an adversary’s task and cause duress to the adversary as the
        exercise scenario plays out. Finally, when initial denial fails and the unit is not capable of
        regaining custody in a timely manner, the unit will be graded UNSATISFACTORY.
        3.5.2.5.3.4. Modeling and Simulation. As available and applicable, the inspector may use
        computer modeling and simulation tools as enablers in determining security effectiveness
        and as a viable measuring tool for developing and refining response force scenarios based
        on the published DIA NSTCA.

        for the generation of additional records not already required by the DoD Directive or USAF
        Supplement. [USAF]
        3.5.2.8.6. DELETED.
     3.5.2.9. Logistics Movement. All units supporting or having responsibility for logistics move-
     ment of nuclear weapons are subject to NSIs. Wartime emergency re-supply movements will not
     be evaluated during NSIs. However, noncustodial units will be required to demonstrate an
     approved procedure for nuclear weapon tiedown of each weapon system for which the units have
     a stated mission.
        3.5.2.9.1. Applicability. For an organization whose sole nuclear weapons responsibility is the
        transportation of nuclear weapons, only that capability is subject to inspection. For an organi-
        zation whose sole nuclear weapons responsibility is in the area of providing support (direct or
        indirect), only those support functions are subject to inspection, and only insofar as they per-
        tain to the execution of nuclear weapons logistic movement during the inspection of a sup-
        ported unit. For an organization whose logistic movement capability is an inherent part of its
        overall nuclear capability, the logistic movement functions shall be inspected in conjunction
        with the NSI of the unit’s overall nuclear capability. The following are general categories of
        logistic movements subject to NSIs and examples of support organizations that may become
        involved in each category:
            3.5.2.9.1.1. Military Airlift Operations. Air Mobility Command (AMC) and supporting
            commands, as applicable. [USAF]
            3.5.2.9.1.2. Convoy operations. Includes operational movements to or from launch facili-
            ties and weapon movement activities. Logistics airlift units must demonstrate the ability to
            provide effective command and control (C2) as well as safely and properly load, transport,
            unload, and transfer custody of weapons. For ICBM units, the capability to transfer/trans-
            port, load/unload, tie-down and transfer custody of weapons for payload transfer missions
            may be evaluated as a logistics movement. [USAF]
            3.5.2.9.1.3. Observance of explosives and active material limits and compatibility of
            items during transportation. [USAF]
        3.5.2.9.2. Scope. All organizations supporting or having responsibility for logistic movement
        of nuclear weapons shall be required to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas, as
        applicable, insofar as it pertains to logistic movement and is included in the inspected unit’s
        mission:
            3.5.2.9.2.1. Security (see paragraph 3.5.2.5. and Attachment 4.).

        ons and associated material. The unit, as tasked by higher headquarters, must demonstrate the
        ability to effectively and safely perform and report emergency evacuation operations in accor-
        dance with higher headquarters directives.
        3.5.2.12.2. Command Disablement. Evaluate unit plans and procedures used to meet the pri-
        mary objective to render weapons tactically useless and for the removal, storage, and destruc-
        tion of specified WR components according to command directives. The unit must
        demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report, in accordance with higher
        headquarters directives, command disablement actions whether tasked by higher headquarters
        or to prevent the unauthorized use of WR weapons should hostile forces threaten to seize
        them.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                          41


           3.5.2.12.3. Emergency Response: Evaluate the wing/installation's response to a peacetime
           overt attack to determine how effectively base resources are used to defend against overt
           attacks on areas where WR weapons or weapon systems may be located (e.g., in storage, in
           maintenance, in convoy). Use realistic scenarios that are based on the NWSS per para 3.5.2.5.
           Note: WR weapons will not be used in exercise
               3.5.2.12.3.1. Evaluate the response of tasked agencies including initial-response teams,
               disaster response force (DRF), munitions/maintenance, wing safety, civil engineers, medi-
               cal, command and control, and follow-on recovery operations (IAW applicable DOD and
               USAF guidance, the installation security plan, and other documents specific to denial/
               recapture/recovery operations). The evaluation will also consider: 1). The wing/installa-
               tion's assessment of the threat and immediacy of actions taken during response/recapture/
               recovery. 2). The effectiveness of the planning, training, and exercising of tasked agencies
               and/or activities to counter an overt attack or preparations for an overt attack. 3). The use
               of available wing/installation resources to counter or recover from an overt attack. 4). The
               command, control, and communications of all forces involved. 5). The implementation of
               the installation force protection plans. 6). Timeliness and accuracy of required reports.
               3.5.2.12.3.2. Although the results of this exercise may affect ratings in other nuclear
               inspection areas (e.g., MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION, SECURITY, EOD,
               etc.), the intent is to have the Emergency Response results reflected in the wing/installa-
               tion’s rating for EMERGENCY EXERCISES. Like the other major graded areas, the rat-
               ing for EMERGENCY EXERCISES directly affects the wing/installation’s overall rating
               for the inspection.
               3.5.2.12.3.3. This paragraph establishes pass/fail criteria (in addition to those presented in
               TO 11N-25-1, Section 3) for the Emergency Response exercise. An UNSATISFACTORY
               rating will be assigned for any of the following: 1). Failure of required response forces to
               respond within the time limits specified in DOD C-5210.41-M, as supplemented. 2). Fail-
               ure of response forces to conduct recapture/recovery operations as specified in DOD
               C-5210.41-M, as supplemented, and CJCSI 3261.02. 3). Failure to re-establish adequate
               security and access control for a WR weapon or weapon system. 4). If post recovery
               actions, weapon RSP, or RSP continuation procedures by EOD result in an unsafe or unre-
               liable weapon.
       3.5.2.13. USE CONTROL. Evaluate Permissive Action Link, Command Disablement System,
       and Active Protection System operations per CJCSI 3260.01A, Joint Policy Governing Positive
       Control Material and Devices, and other applicable higher headquarters directives. [USAF]

3.6. Nuclear Inspection Rating System. Assign ratings of “Satisfactory,” “Satisfactory (Support Unsat-
isfactory)” (for deficiencies attributed to outside agencies or higher headquarters), or “Unsatisfactory” for
the overall inspection. Base the final rating on the nature, severity, and number of findings noted during
the inspection. Use the 5-level rating system described in paragraph 2.2.3. for each applicable evaluated
area. For phased NSIs and LNSIs, an overall rating will be assigned upon completing the inspection.
Assign “Ready” or “Not Ready” ratings for INSIs.

3.7. Reinspection of Deficient Areas. MAJCOMs use the following guidance to determine reinspection
policy:
42                                                              AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


     3.7.1. If the overall inspection rating is “Unsatisfactory,” reinspect the deficient areas that caused or
     contributed to an “Unsatisfactory” rating.
        3.7.1.1. Conduct a reinspection (NSI or LNSI) within 90 calendar days for units rated “Unsatis-
        factory” that do not achieve an overall “Satisfactory” rating on an on-the-spot reinspection.
     3.7.2. Before terminating the inspection, the team chief may conduct an on-the-spot reinspection of
     the deficient areas that caused or contributed to an “Unsatisfactory” rating. If a reinspection is con-
     ducted, the message report and the formal report must reflect both the original and reinspection ratings
     for the overall grade and the deficient areas that caused or contributed to an “Unsatisfactory” rating.
     An immediate reinspection that yields a minimum rating of “Marginal” in the previously deficient
     area indicates that the deficiency is sufficiently corrected to permit operations, and a 90-calendar-day
     follow-up inspection is not required. The following apply when determining if an on-the-spot rein-
     spection is appropriate:
        3.7.2.1. Do not reinspect if the failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of profi-
        ciency within the unit.
        3.7.2.2. Do not reinspect if suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of
        nuclear safety, security, or reliability.
        3.7.2.3. Reinspect if the “Unsatisfactory” rating was caused by an individual's error and training
        was adequate.
        3.7.2.4. Consider reinspection if the “Unsatisfactory” rating was caused by an administrative
        error that can be resolved quickly and easily; for example, improper guidance or procedure in a
        unit instruction, operations plan, or operations order.
     3.7.3. For a unit rated “Unsatisfactory” that does not achieve a “Satisfactory” on a reinspection, the
     MAJCOM commander must approve the unit’s use of nuclear weapons. MAJCOMs ensure nuclear
     weapons are maintained reliably and afforded a safe and secure environment until restrictions are
     removed by a reinspection.

3.8. Actions on Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Inspection Reports.
     3.8.1. Units coordinate replies to DTRA (JNSI) and Surveillance Inspection (SI) reports through the
     appropriate MAJCOM functional manager. Critical/major deficiencies require a description of the
     unit’s corrective action. Minor deficiencies simply require a statement that the corrective action is
     completed. The MAJCOM CARS program monitor will coordinate the MAJCOM response and for-
     ward to the AFIA/IO. An initial response is required 90 days after the date of the final report. If the
     report is not closed within 180 days of the date of the final report, the MAJCOM CARS program mon-
     itor will provide an update every 30 days on open deficiencies until the report is closed. Take correc-
     tive action based on the field report provided by the DTRA team at the time of the inspection.
        3.8.1.1. If all deficiencies are corrected within 12 months of the final report, provide a letter from
        the MAJCOM/CV designated representative that the MAJCOM concurs with all corrective
        actions and requests closure of the DTRA inspection report. If all deficiencies are not corrected
        within 12 months, provide the closure request letter directly from the MAJCOM/CV.
     3.8.2. With an overall “Unsatisfactory” DNSI/JNSI rating, the MAJCOM must evaluate the results
     and the unit's status to determine if the procedures of paragraph 3.5.1.1. should be invoked. The MAJ-
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                         43


   COM must notify HQ AFSC/SEW and SAF/IG of the evaluation results within 24 hours (by priority
   message) after the DTRA inspection is completed.

3.9. Nuclear Inspection Reports . Provide the results of NSIs in message and formal report formats.
Carefully consider classification of the report using classification guides such as AFI 31-407, Air Force
Nuclear Weapons Security Classification Policy and/or the Joint Nuclear Weapons Classification Guide,
CG-W-5 to make an appropriate decision. Include a paragraph reference from the applicable DOD or Air
Force instruction or technical order for all deficiencies cited. LNSIs and INSIs are normally reported only
by message.
   3.9.1. Message Report (RCS: SAF-IG(AR)0006). Inspection teams report the results of an NSI,
   LNSI, and INSI in the formats shown in Attachment 3. Do not combine NSI, LNSI, and INSI mes-
   sage reports with other inspection message reports.
       3.9.1.1. Use priority precedence when reporting “Unsatisfactory” (NSI and LNSI) or “Not
       Ready” (INSI) ratings. Even during MINIMIZE, submit an inspection message if the unit is found
       “Not Ready,” “Unsatisfactory,” or has critical/major deficiencies. Include a description of all crit-
       ical/major deficiencies (see Attachment 3 and Attachment 4).
   3.9.2. Extract Message Report (RCS: SAF-IG(AR)0007). Inspecting teams extract LIMFACs and
   critical/major deficiencies that are the responsibility of a support activity outside the MAJCOM. Send
   an Extract Message Report (see Attachment 4) as follows:
       3.9.2.1. An action copy to the responsible MAJCOM IG and applicable staff agency.
       3.9.2.2. Information copies to the responsible organization, its intermediate headquarters, and
       basic report addressees.
   3.9.3. Procedural Responsibility. MAJCOMs establish procedures for processing, tracking, and cor-
   recting identified critical/major/minor deficiencies. Deficiencies that are corrected before the inspec-
   tion is completed do not require processing.
   3.9.4. Formal NSI Report (RCS: SAF-IG(AR)0005). The MAJCOM inspection team will:
       3.9.4.1. If the formal NSI report will be prepared after the inspection team departs, provide the
       unit commander enough information to allow corrective action to be taken. List all deficiencies
       under one of the 13 areas in paragraph 3.5.2. Deficiencies identified against a Higher Headquar-
       ters or other support agency should be put in a separate section (e.g., Tab B) unless the unit shares
       some of the responsibility for the deficiency.
       3.9.4.2. Prepare the formal NSI report according to MAJCOM directives. If applicable, send the
       entire report, or those parts that report on the supporting unit's functions, to the MAJCOM that
       provided support. In addition to addressees specified by the MAJCOM, send copies of this report
       to each of the addressees listed in Table 3.1.

             AIR FORCE INSPECTION AGENCY (AFIA) PROGRAM ELEMENTS

4.1. Eagle Look Management Reviews. An Eagle Look is an independent and objective management
review of key Air Force-wide processes requested by senior leadership. Each Eagle Look culminates with
a written report and executive briefing, which includes recommendations, results, and follow-up, intended
to improve operations, support, and acquisition functions.
   4.1.1. Topic Sponsors. Eagle Look topics are provided and sponsored by the Secretariat, HQ USAF
   Deputy Chiefs of Staff, MAJCOMs and other Air Force senior leadership. SAF/IG may sponsor a
   topic independently.
   4.1.2. Topic Selection and Approval. Air Force personnel may forward proposed topics, including
   background and rationale. Secretariat and HQ USAF offices forward topics directly to AFIA/CC.
   MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs forward topics that cross MAJCOM lines or apply Air Force-wide to
   AFIA/CC, who will ensure proposed topics/studies are not redundant. AFIA/CC and SAF/IGI will
   coordinate with DOD/IG, Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA), and other oversight agencies as applica-
   ble. SAF/IG approves the topics. Submit Eagle Look topic proposals IAW Attachment 8.
   4.1.3. Methodology. Eagle Looks by nature highlight the most significant issues and provide timely
   feedback (80% solution) for senior leadership action. They are conducted in accordance with, and
   conform to, the Quality Standards for Inspections published by the President’s Council on Integrity
   and Efficiency, Mar 93. The Eagle Look process seeks out a representative cross section of Air Force
   personnel providing policy, leadership and execution of a particular Air Force-wide process or pro-
   gram. These personnel are interviewed to determine how process(es) are or are not working, and how
   they can be improved. The interview population is carefully selected and interviewed using data col-
   lection methods that are unbiased, tailored to the interview population, and tested for validity. After a
   thorough and objective analysis of the interview data, teams write a draft report that includes findings,
   recommendations, and observations. The reports undergo multiple internal and external review cycles
   to ensure they accurately portray the data. A policy of strict non-attribution is followed so that inter-
   viewees will feel free to be candid in their responses. As a result, all responses in the report cannot be
   attributed or traced to any individual. Information is portrayed and discussed in terms of prevalent or
   significant trends across the Air Force. Prior to publishing the Eagle Look report, findings, observa-
   tions, and recommendations are briefed to the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Chief of Staff equiva-
   lent with opportunity offered for management comments, which are included verbatim in the final
   report.
   4.1.4. Report Follow-up. The purpose of follow-up is to ascertain and compile a historical record of
   actions taken to address the issues identified in Eagle Look reports. AFIA will conduct follow-up on
   Eagle Look findings with organizations identified as OPRs for associated recommendations. Fol-
   low-up will be conducted at 9 and 18 months after Eagle Look report publication, and will culminate
   with a letter from TIG back to the OPRs delineating the status of actions taken to address the issues
   identified in the findings.

4.2. Compliance Inspection (CI). AFIA conducts compliance inspections of Air Force-level DRUs and
FOAs. These inspections focus on the applicable CCCAs listed in paragraph A6.2. as a minimum, and any
46                                                            AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


additional CCCAs listed in paragraph A6.3. that are mutually agreed upon by AFIA and the DRU/FOA
commander.
     4.2.1. AFIA evaluates SIIs during AFIA-conducted compliance inspections and provides results to
     SAF/IGI.

4.3. Health Services Inspection (HSI). HSIs assess the functioning and execution of Air Force Medical
Service (AFMS) programs and processes at the local level in order to provide senior leadership with accu-
rate data upon which to base policy decisions. HSIs also assess the ability of Air Force medical units to
fulfill their peacetime and wartime missions, including provision of medical care, success in training and
equipping deployable personnel, and support of the host wing mission.
     4.3.1. Criteria and Inspection Guides. HQ AFIA/SG derives criteria from health care policies of the
     Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the office of the Air Force Surgeon
     General (HQ USAF/SG), various civilian medical oversight agencies [such as the Joint Commission
     and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC)], the NGB, and the AFRC.
     AFIA/SG, based on changes in health care policies, regulatory guidance and coordination with MAJ-
     COM/SG staffs, annually updates the next year’s inspection guide and posts to the AFIA website.
     Inspectors assess sustained performance by reviewing substantiating documents created since the last
     inspection.
     4.3.2. Ratings. Each medical unit receives an overall score with a corresponding rating of Out-stand-
     ing, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory as defined in Attachment 1.
     4.3.3. HSI Frequency.
        4.3.3.1. Active Duty (AD) medical treatment facilities are inspected with an overall AFMS aver-
        age of 36 months. An HSI is normally conducted simultaneously with a survey by the Joint Com-
        mission for bedded medical units and AAAHC for non-bedded medical units. AD units are
        selected for inspection based upon criteria jointly agreed upon by AFIA, AAAHC and the Joint
        Commission.
            4.3.3.1.1. AD medical units update their AFIA held demographics whenever they become
            aware of an event that may affect the scheduling process. AD bedded medical units must
            update their electronic Joint Commission application annually. The Joint Commission also
            requires a formal self-inspection report using their proprietary format between 15-18 months
            from the previous survey. AD non-bedded medical units must submit a new application with
            AAAHC which must be received no later than 90 days prior to their reaccreditation survey
            date. During the term of accreditation, AAAHC also requires written notification within 30
            days of any significant organizational, operational or financial changes that can occur.
            4.3.3.1.2. AFIA contacts the MAJCOM IG gatekeeper approximately 90 days prior to a
            scheduled HSI to ascertain any unannounced MAJCOM planned activities that may interfere
            with the HSI process.
            4.3.3.1.3. MTFs requesting postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled active duty inspection
            must be forwarded to AFIA/SG for approval following Wing CC (or equivalent), MAJCOM/
            SG coordination and AF/SG concurrence. MTFs should allow sufficient time to process and
            coordinate postponement requests ensuring AFIA/SG has appropriate information to make a
            decision to approve/disapprove the request. Refer to paragraph 4.3.3.3. for postponement/
            re-schedule criteria.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                      47


     4.3.3.2. ARC units are inspected on average every 48 months not to exceed 60 months from the
     date of the last HSI. AFIA/SG publishes a calendar year ARC HSI schedule in coordination with
     AFRC/IG/SG and NGB/IG/SG. In keeping with AF policy regarding inspection footprint, AFIA/
     SG will, to the greatest extent possible, schedule medical unit HSIs simultaneously with other
     scheduled wing inspections and assessments (e.g., UCI, ASEV). Note: For purposes of this
     instruction, NGB/SG is a MAJCOM equivalent.
         4.3.3.2.1. Unit requests for postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled ARC or AES HSI must
         be forwarded to AFIA/SG following MAJCOM coordination and policies. Units should allow
         sufficient time to process and coordinate postponement requests ensuring AFIA/SG has the
         time and appropriate information to make a decision to approve/disapprove the request. Refer
         to paragraph 4.3.3.3. for postponement/re-schedule criteria.
     4.3.3.3. Certain events or circumstances may affect inspection scheduling for AD and ARC units.
     The following are criteria and guidelines units will use to determine if a request for postponement/
     re-schedule is justified. Any request to postpone an AD inspection exceeding 36 months and an
     ARC inspection exceeding 60 months requires a waiver from the AFIA/SG.
         4.3.3.3.1. A medical unit deploying 20 percent or more of its assigned medical personnel for
         greater than 90 days will not be inspected 30 days (AD) or 90 days (ARC) following an AEF
         deployment.
         4.3.3.3.2. An ARC unit undergoing a wing-level weapon system conversion (resulting in a
         significant impact of the medical unit) will be inspected within 6 months after such a conver-
         sion.
         4.3.3.3.3. A unit change resulting in 50 percent or greater change in personnel authorizations.
         4.3.3.3.4. A real-world disaster or contingency operation resulting in the unit relocating or
         suspending operations.
         4.3.3.3.5. A unit participating in a MAJCOM-level inspection (e.g., ORI) involving 40 per-
         cent or more of the unit’s personnel occurring simultaneously with the scheduled HSI.
     4.3.3.4. Follow-up inspections.
         4.3.3.4.1. All units receiving an overall rating of “Unsatisfactory” or “Marginal” during an
         HSI will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 18 months.
            4.3.3.4.1.1. The MAJCOM/SG or equivalent will conduct a staff assistance visit within
            six months to assess status. This report will be forwarded to AFIA/SG.
         4.3.3.4.2. For ARC and ARC AE units, the next scheduled HSI will be conducted in conjunc-
         tion with the next scheduled UCI not to exceed 60 months from the date of the initial unsatis-
         factory/marginal HSI.
  4.3.4. Reports and Follow-up Responses. Reports and Follow-up Responses. An electronic/paper
  copy HSI report is published and left with the unit and wing commander at the conclusion of the
  inspection. A final copy is distributed to AF/SG, MAJCOM/SG and other interested staff agencies
  after review at AFIA.
     4.3.4.1. “Programmatic Failure” and “Critical” (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for all units

        ments are expected to be completely resolved within 12 months. Units are required to provide fol-
        low-up replies, including estimated completion dates, every 90 days until closure to their
        respective MAJCOM/SGs (or equivalent) IAW instructions outlined in the HSI final report.
        4.3.4.2. “Programmatic Failure” and “Critical” (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for ARC units
        and AESs require a response (close-out or interim update) within 6 months of the inspection. Units
        are required to provide follow-up replies, including estimated completion dates, every 3 months
        until closure to their respective MAJ-COM/SGs IAW instructions outlined in the HSI final report.
        These assessments are expected to be completely resolved within 12 months.
     4.3.5. Special Emphasis Items (SEI). SEIs are limited studies, performed during HSIs, whose purpose
     is to gather information on specific issues. Topics to be researched are submitted by field or headquar-
     ters personnel to AFIA/SG for approval/disapproval. SEIs are normally terminated within 6-12
     months and the results are briefed at the annual IG/SG Summit.
     4.3.6. Consultative Visits. AFIA/SG provides Consultative Team Visits to medical treatment facilities
     prioritized by the MAJCOMS. Individual consultant visits may be requested through the AFIA/SG
     Support and Consultation Division based on inspection schedule and resource availability.

4.4. Field Inspection. As applicable, these inspections provide SAF/IG credible, independent assess-
ments of Air Force operational readiness, efficiency, discipline, morale, economy, and effectiveness, as
well as assist in oversight of the Air Force inspection system.
     4.4.1. IG Team Augmentation. On request, AFIA inspectors may augment MAJCOM IG teams dur-
     ing inspections of field units. AFIA augmentees do not write a separate report. Rated inspectors with
     current medical and physiological training prerequisites may fly as observers in unit aircraft when
     appropriate to their inspection role.
     4.4.2. Contingencies and Combat. AFIA inspectors may deploy to forward locations and field head-
     quarters during contingency and/or combat operations to observe processes and recommend solutions
     to readiness problems beyond the control of the local Air Force field commander. These visits require
     approval by the appropriate unified command. This is not an inspection, but is an opportunity for an
     independent and impartial Air Force-level team to analyze systemic readiness problems that may need
     HQ USAF or higher-level attention. Refer also to War Mobilization Plan, Volume 1, Annex O.

4.5. Inspector General Directed Investigation (IGDI). An IGDI is a high-priority investigation
directed by the Inspector General. These investigations are usually time sensitive and findings and recom-
mendations are of significant interest to the Air Force, members of Congress, or the general public. The
Inspector General approves all requests for IGDIs.

4.6. TIG Brief Magazine . AFIA publishes TIG Brief (AFRP 90-1) which provides authoritative guid-
ance and information to commanders, inspectors general, inspectors, and Air Force supervisors and lead-
ers at all levels of command. Anyone may submit articles to AFIA public affairs. Articles should relate
anticipated or actual problems, recommendations to improve management, safety, security, inspection or
operational techniques, crosstell of lessons learned, best practices, or contemporary issues of interest to
the Air Force.

   offices at AFIA/CC discretion while ensuring the privileged status of the reports is protected. AFIA/
   MSO will maintain a record of the official requests for Eagle Look Management Reviews whether
   they are processed by AFIA/CC or SAF/IGI. Summary reports of the management reviews may be
   published in TIG Brief Magazine or other publications if approved by SAF/IG.
   4.7.2. Compliance Inspections and Health Services Inspections are privileged documents and may be
   released in whole or in part only within DOD with the express approval of AFIA/CC while ensuring
   the privileged status of the reports is protected. Compliance Inspections and Health Services Inspec-
   tions are routinely released to the unit, their MAJCOM and the Air Staff. Summary reports of Health
   Services Inspections may be published within the Air Force if approved by AFIA/CC. AFIA/CC will
   maintain a record of the official requests for CIs and HSIs.
   4.7.3. Inspector General Directed Investigations are privileged documents and may be released in
   whole or in part by SAF/IG in accordance with AFI 90-301.

can respond, employ forces, provide mission support, and survive and operate in a combat environment.
Outstanding—The grade given to indicate performance or operation far exceeds mission requirements.
Procedures and activities are carried out in a far superior manner. Resources and programs are very
efficiently managed and are of exceptional merit. Minimal deficiencies exist.
Oversight—The watchful management or supervision of the implementation of policy performed by the
agency responsible for development of that policy.
Readiness—The ability of US military forces to fight and meet the demands of the national military
strategy. Readiness is the synthesis of two distinct but interrelated levels:
   a. Unit Readiness—The ability to provide capabilities required by the combatant commanders to
      execute their assigned missions. This is derived from the ability of each unit to deliver the outputs
      for which it was designed.
   b. Joint Readiness—The combatant commander’s ability to integrate and synchronize ready com-
      bat and support forces to execute his assigned missions.
Recommended Improvement Area—An identified process, product, or capability that could be
improved by a suggested course of action.
Resource Availability—Includes personnel, equipment, or authorized repair parts. Failure results from
shortages within the unit's control, preventing required nuclear weapon technical operations.
Satisfactory—The grade given to indicate performance or operation meets mission requirements.
Procedures and activities are carried out in an effective and competent manner. Resources and programs
are efficiently managed. Minor deficiencies may exist but do not impede or limit mission
accomplishment.

Terms
Checklist:—An inspection guide used as a management tool. Checklists are available on the WACS, and
can be developed using applicable AF regulations and policies. Unit CIP Monitors and Functional Area
Managers use checklists to determine whether the unit or work center is performing to standards.
Corrective Action:—Actions taken to correct a discrepancy. Once accomplished, corrective actions must
be validated by a qualified individual and reviewed by the commander before the discrepancy is closed.
Critical Finding:—These findings identify a serious breech of public law; safety, security, or fiscal
responsibility regulations; or a significant impact or a high probability of significant impact to mission
accomplishment.
AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008                                                                            59


Cross tells:—Lessons learned or best practices from other units that may help other Units improve
combat readiness and/or mission effectiveness. Crosstells are documented in inspection reports, TIG
Brief magazine, on websites, or shared directly.
Discrepancy:—Any non-compliance with regulation or policy or directives. There are four categories of
discrepancies: Limiting Factor, Critical Finding, Non-Critical Finding, and Improvement Item.
Finding:—A discrepancy, which does not comply with policy or other regulatory guidance and limits or
impedes the unit’s ability to perform its mission, but correction is within the unit’s capability. Findings are
divided into two categories: Critical and Non-Critical.
Improvement Item:—A discrepancy, which does not comply with policy or other guidance, but does not
affect the unit’s ability to accomplish the mission nor violate public law, safety, security, or fiscal
responsibility regulations.
Limiting Factor (LIMFAC):—A discrepancy that limits or impedes the unit’s ability to accomplish its
mission and is normally beyond the unit’s ability to correct.
Non-Critical Finding:—Other findings which, if not corrected, could impact the economy, efficiency,
and effectiveness of the unit being inspected but would not result in serious impact to mission
accomplishment or have a very low probability of significant impact on the mission.
Special Interest Items:—SIIs are issued at AF and Major Command levels, and inspected by AFIA and
11 WG/IGI. The purpose of an SII is to determine the extent and impact of known or suspected problems,
identify specific deficiencies, or to confirm that a previously identified problem has been corrected.

NOTES:


         1. An INSI may be conducted on one or more facilities that are typical of new construction at a base.
            If no other similar structures or facilities are modified after the INSI of typical structures, an
            inspection of other structures or facilities is not required. If new structures or facilities are located
            in a specific area (alert area or weapons storage area) and all of the area is affected, inspect the
            entire area after construction is completed.
         2. An INSI of new security intrusion detection systems is required after satisfactory completion of
            the Phase III testing. Significantly modified intrusion detection systems must be recertified by an
            INSI or MAJCOM A7S staff. Significant modifications include added, removed, or modified
            sensors not part of the original certified system, change to source code on computer based intru-
            sion detection system, or installation of new software (this does not include upgrades to existing
            software that have been properly certified). The responsible MAJCOM must certify the system
            for operational use.
         3. An INSI is required if the unit is being certified for the first time for its contingency nuclear mis-
            sion or if the 18-month certification is expired. An LNSI may be conducted (in lieu of an NSI) if
            the unit had an NSI within 18 months, but a subordinate unit requires certification. (EXAMPLE:
            A wing with two combat delivery squadrons tasked for a contingency nuclear capability receives
            an INSI, but only one of its two squadrons is certified. An LNSI may be accomplished if the sec-
            ond combat delivery squadron is subsequently tasked to demonstrate capability and the required
62                                                            AFI90-201_11WGSUP_I 25 JUNE 2008


        certification inspection occurs within 18 months of the wing's last inspection. Under these circum-
        stances, the MAJCOM inspection team must decide whether to accomplish an LNSI or NSI.)
     4. An INSI is required if the unit has not had an NSI within the 18-month requirement unless a
        waiver was approved by SAF/IG. The unit will be decertified and cease all nuclear critical tasks
        until the INSI is complete. The MAJCOM CC is responsible for insuring the safety and security
        of all nuclear assets during the interim period between decertification and recertification.
     5. Significance of modification will be determined by the responsible MAJCOM functional(s) in
        coordination with AFSC/SEW and documented IAW paragraph 3.2.

Utilization. The inspection areas and items in this guide identify minimum-security standards and capa-
bilities outlined in DOD S-5210.41-M, as supplemented. When assessing whether a unit complies with
applicable technical criteria, inspectors use this guide as a sampling tool to identify areas/items to conduct
performance test(s), compliance validation, or security exercises. Inspectors also use this guide during
security exercises to assess how applicable areas/items contribute to a unit’s ability to meet the NWSS and
provide effective response to emergencies. Inspectors will use the published Integrated Base Defense
Security System (IBDSS) Capability Development Document (CDD) to inspect applicable technology
listed in this guide.

                                      READINESS INSPECTIONS

A5.1. Major Graded Areas and Subareas. Units with a wartime or contingency mission will be evalu-
ated in four major areas: initial response, employment, mission support, and the ability to survive and
operate in a hostile environment. IGs will apply the common core readiness criteria (described in para-
graph 2.2.4.) to each of the applicable major graded areas and subareas. Major graded areas can be evalu-
ated at either home-station or a deployed location. If evaluated at home station, the IG will provide the
simulated wartime scenario.

A5.2. Initial Response.
     A5.2.1. Command and Control. (C2). Evaluate the effectiveness of those initial response actions
     performed by the Wing Battle Staff, the Wing Command Post, the Maintenance Operations Center and
     other wing C2 agencies which affect the entire unit’s ability to respond to initial deployment tasking.
        A5.2.1.1. Determine if the Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS) and Air
        Expeditionary Force Reporting Tool (ART) reporting is timely, accurate, and properly classified.
        A5.2.1.2. Evaluate Unit Manning Document and Deployed Requirements Manning Document for
        accuracy.
     A5.2.2. Employment Readiness
        A5.2.2.1. Evaluate aircraft generation, deployment, and regeneration

A9.5. Ability To Survive And Operate. Evaluate the AOC ability to survive and operate from deploy-
ment to full wartime contingency operations. Events may range from evaluation of INFOCON/FPCON
change response actions to direct attack. All situations are evaluated, but consideration is given for
actions taken at AOC level to resolve or work around existing shortfalls when full response control is not
within AOC purview. Inspection focus is based on doctrinal location and combat situation of the AOC as
the contingency develops. Command and Control, Passive Defense Measures, Passive Defense
Response, Casualty Care, Force Protection, and Defensive Counterinformation; will be rated:
   A9.5.1. Command and Control. Evaluate actions taken by command and leadership to sustain,
   defend, survive, and recover.
   A9.5.2. Passive Defense Measures. Evaluate the ability of the AOC facility to run on alternative
   power source.
   A9.5.3. Casualty Care (Self-Aid/Buddy Care) SABC. Personnel shall demonstrate planning for
   post-attack casualty searches, administration of SA/BC treatment, and transportation of victims to a
   deployed medical facility (DMF) or other designated location. Evaluations will be conducted IAW
   guidance described in AFI 36-2238, Self-Aid and Buddy Care Training; AFH 36-2218V1, Self-Aid
   and Buddy Care Instructor Handbook.
   A9.5.4. Force Protection. Evaluate AOC measures to mitigate risks and to protect personnel and
   resources during contingency operations. AOC personnel must be prepared to identify, report, and
   counter any threat activity that occurs within their area of operations, support, or control centers.
   A9.5.5. Defensive Counterinformation. Evaluate the IW element coordination with NOSC-D to
   ensure protection of coalition forces’ information infrastructure from attacks (i.e. introduction of com-
   puter viruses to computer networks, attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to systems, OPSEC
   violations, counterintelligence threats, etc).
   A9.5.6. Evaluate coordination of OPSEC activities including telephone, cell phone, internet, and
   e-mail monitoring.
