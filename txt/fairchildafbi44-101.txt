     (Lt Col Eleanor T. Foreman)                                                            Pages: 5

This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 44-1, Medical Operations. This Fair-
child Air Force Base Instruction (FAFBI) establishes the wing’s Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) pro-
gram. The program provides guidance for Automated External Defibrillators (AED) in strategic
locations. The AEDs allow access by trained individuals to use in attempts to revive personnel during
certain cardiac crises prior to arrival of emergency medical personnel or basic life support (BLS) trained
personnel. This instruction identifies responsibilities, maintenance, quality assurance, and documentation
requirements. This instruction does apply to the Guard and Reserves if they are on Active Duty status.


1. Responsibilities:
   1.1. 92d Air Refueling Wing Commander (92 ARW/CC). The 92 ARW/CC has the overall
   responsibility for the PAD program. The 92 ARW/CC directs the Commander, 92d Medical Group
   (92 MDG/CC), to ensure proper medical objectives are maintained for the PAD program.
   1.2. 92d Medical Group Commander (92 MDG/CC). The 92 MDG/CC is responsible to the 92
   ARW/CC for implementation of the PAD program. The 92 MDG/CC will ensure all medical objec-
   tives are maintained and provide professional guidance on program administration. The 92 MDG/CC
   will appoint in writing, a Medical Director and Program Coordinator for the PAD program.
   1.3. Medical Director. The Medical Director will be a physician proficient in emergency medical
   protocols, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of AEDs in accordance with Federal
   guidance (FTCA, 28 V.S.C. sections 1346(b), 2671-80). The Medical Director is responsible for pro-
   viding oversight of training, coordination of emergency medical services, clinical protocols and for-
   mulation of AED deployment strategies. The Medical Director will develop quality assurance and
   guidelines for use of the AED and will review or have a designated representative review all event
   summary sheets within 48 hours of occurrence.

    1.4. Program Coordinator. The Program Coordinator will normally be appointed from the staff of
    the 92 MDG, Education and Training Flight. As a minimum, the Program Coordinator will be a BLS/
    CPR Instructor Trainer.
       1.4.1. The Program Coordinator will:
           1.4.1.1. Oversee all training processes for adult CPR/AED training.
           1.4.1.2. Arrange annual inspections of site AEDs and maintain documentation of those
           inspections.
           1.4.1.3. Maintain a master list of the location (Building and Room Number) of all AEDs on
           Fairchild AFB and all Site Coordinators’ names and phone numbers.
    1.5. Site Coordinators. The Site Coordinators will be approved by the Program Coordinator and
    must be trained in BLS/AED and appointed, in writing, by the unit commander. Additional Site Coor-
    dinator responsibilities are to:
       1.5.1. Ensure all required inspections and maintenance actions are accomplished in accordance
       with the manufacturer’s manual and maintained in the Site Coordinator’s Files.
       1.5.2. Designate target responders.
       1.5.3. Ensure proper user AED training is conducted and documented in the Training Record.
       1.5.4. Inform the Program Coordinator in writing prior to relocating any AED.
       1.5.5. Obtain written approval from the 92 MDG/CC prior to installation, replacement or change
       in location of any AED.
    1.6. Target Responders. A core group of personnel most likely to be called upon to use the AED will
    be identified as targeted responders within their facility based upon staffing, type of facility, continu-
    ity and risk. It is not necessary that all military members or civilian employees of a work center be
    specifically trained in the use of the AED. EXAMPLE: At a permanently staffed front-desk, as in a
    service organization, it may be appropriate to train only front desk personnel in the vicinity of the
    AED. In areas with multiple work centers in a large building with a centrally located AED, it may be
    appropriate to train one or more persons in each work center.
       1.6.1. The AED equipment is labeled for use by a “new user” and includes automated voice
       prompts. Those individuals identified by site coordinators as targeted responders must be trained
       in an approved adult CPR/AED course. Targeted responders must contact the unit BLS/AED
       instructor to schedule BLS/AED training.
    1.7. Events Summary Sheet. An Events Summary Sheet (See Attachment 2) will be completed by
    the individual using an AED on a victim. Blank copies of the summary sheet will be maintained in the
    Site Coordinators AED binder. The summary sheet must be forwarded to the 92 MDG/SGH or desig-
    nee within 24 duty hours.

2. Maintenance. The 92d Medical Support Squadron, Biomedical Equipment Repair Element (92
MDSS/SGSLM) will serve as the point of contact for both Site Coordinators. 92 MDSS/SGSLM is
responsible for inspections or maintenance beyond the Site Coordinator’s ability to accomplish using the
manufacturer owner’s manual. Any issues which must be addressed with the manufacturer will be fun-
neled through 92 MDSS/SGSLM. Any cost associated with repairs (i.e., replacement parts, batteries) will

be the responsibility of the owning unit. Generally, AEDs are stand-alone, maintenance-free equipment
with a battery life of roughly 5 years. Units are generally replaced when they approach their 5 year life
expectancy. Initial installation of AEDs must be coordinated through 92d Civil Engineer Squadron and
the Site Coordinator after approval by 92 MDG/CC.

3. Quality Assurance. The Medical Director or designee will review all Event Summary Sheets to
assess quality of care within 48 hours of occurrence. The Medical Director will report to Executive Com-
mittee of the Medical Staff any completed Event Summary Sheets at next scheduled meeting.

4. Use. Use of AEDs will be in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions on the AED. The AED
itself detects electrical activity of the victim’s heart and will instruct when an AED shock should be
administered. The “911 Response” must be activated as soon as possible upon discovery of a victim.
   4.1. General electrical safety procedures include:
       4.1.1. Do not use the AED when the rescuer or victim is soaking wet or is in water.
       4.1.2. Do not use the AED in areas of high concentration of volatile gas or combustible fumes.
       4.1.3. Do not attempt to use the AED if the patient is still in contact with “live voltage” electrical
       wiring that caused the heart stoppage.

5. Requests for New AEDs. Any work center desiring a new or additional AED must submit an equip-
ment request through unit channels for funding. All purchases must be made by the 92 MDSS Medical
Logistics Flight (92 MDSS/SGSL) using the requesting unit’s funds. 92 MDSS/SGSL will ensure all 92
ARW AEDs are standardized for the sake of continuity and safety.
