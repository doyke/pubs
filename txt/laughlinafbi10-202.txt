Section B—47 FTW Crisis Action Team

2. CAT Composition. The CAT is convened at the discretion of the Wing Commander in
response to crisis or contingency operations. CAT Senior Staff members include the Wing
Commander as chair, the Vice Commander, all Group Commanders, and the Command Chief.
Additional CAT personnel are summoned in accordance with the nature of the crisis. The XP
Director is the executive agent and is responsible for procedural training and support. The
composition of the CAT will vary depending on the nature of the situation.
3. CAT Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of each CAT member to ensure an alternate is
available when the primary member is on temporary duty (TDY) or away from home station
(TDY, leave, etc.). CAT members must possess at least a Secret security clearance and will be
familiar with all actions associated with varying stages of increased readiness or emergency
conditions. During an extended crisis situation, the CAT Director will determine minimum CAT
representation and establish work shifts to sustain operations.
4. Contingency Response Process. The 47 FTW CAT is tasked to coordinate all necessary
actions during contingency operations. The Wing Commander (47 FTW/CC) or a designated
representative will coordinate actions with the AETC Commander (AETC/CC) and senior staff.
     4.1. The XP Director is the OPR for training and coordination of the CAT operations, and
     serves as the primary CAT Director. At least two alternate directors will also be appointed
     and trained.
     4.2. Recall of the CAT and other necessary personnel will be at the direction of the Wing
     Commander.
     4.3. Command Post will maintain a 24-hour capability to recall the CAT and wing
     personnel.
     4.4. When a full response is determined to be inappropriate, the Wing Commander may use
     a tailored CAT, consisting of only those functional areas appropriate to the current situation
     (nonessential members are released), or watch team (WT) to respond to a given situation.
     4.5. The CAT Director will conduct briefings as required.         Items that may be briefed
     include:
        4.5.1. Situation. Summary of events leading to the current situation.
        4.5.2. Intelligence. Pertinent intelligence information that may affect the situation.
        4.5.3. Weather. Current or forecast weather that may affect LAFB operations.
        4.5.4. Required Action. Summary of contingency plans providing options and
        requirements for response. This includes pertinent contingency checklists used to initiate
        base response actions.
        4.5.5. Current Status. Completed or pending actions, delays and causes, and estimated
        completion times.
        4.5.6. Security Precautions. Physical, information assurance, communications security
        (COMSEC), and operations security (OPSEC) pertaining to the situation.
        4.5.7. Media Status. If media interest is involved.

Section D—Wing Recall

13. Wing Recall Procedures and Personnel Accountability.
   13.1. Unit Recall System. All wing or tenant units will develop a pyramid recall system to
   facilitate contact with all assigned military, civilian employees and contractors who may be
   subject to recall. This includes development of means to contact personnel in a
   communication-out (Comm-out) situation.
   13.2. Recall Rosters. All wing and tenant units will provide their respective recall rosters to
   the Wing Command Post for consolidation in the event a base-wide recall is directed by the
   Wing Commander. In order to insure maximum accuracy, unit recall rosters will be updated
   and submitted to the Command Post upon any personnel change or on a quarterly basis by
   the 1st of the month indicated (JAN, APR, JUL, OCT). The Command Post will initiate the
   recall utilizing standardized recall options as outlined below. Unit Commanders are
   responsible for compiling the results of their respective unit recall and reporting attainment
   and personnel accountability at directed intervals.
   13.3. Personnel accountability. This is the process for determining the physical location and
   status of all personnel under direct control of local military authority. This may include the
   status of family members and others who are eligible for direct/indirect military support and
   are affected by events related to completion of local military mission requirements.
      13.3.1. Personnel Categories. There are six categories of personnel covered under an
      accountability recall. These include Military, DoD Civilian, NAF Civilian, DoD
      Contractor, Active Duty Military family members, and all other family
      members/personnel eligible for direct/indirect support by military authorities as
      determined by local military authority or higher headquarters.
      13.3.2. Reasons for Personnel Accountability. A Personnel Accountability recall may be
      initiated for a number of reasons, to include determination of personnel available for duty
      (Military, Civilian, or Contractor), or determination of personnel eligible for
      direct/indirect support by local military authority and government contract management
      whose welfare contributes to the local mission. The recall may also be a result of a
      natural or man-made disaster somewhere in the world requiring the Air Force to
      determine accountability of all employees and dependents who could potentially be in the
      disaster area.
      13.3.3. Types of Personnel Accountability Recalls. There are two types of personnel
      accountability recalls that can be initiated.
          13.3.3.1. Wing Initiated Recall. These will be initiated by the Wing Commander and
          will be conducted by telephone or other means to account for all personnel and
          dependents assigned or attached to Laughlin AFB units. Results will be compiled in
          accordance with the recall option chosen.
8                                                     LAUGHLINAFBI10-202 14 MAY 2013


          13.3.3.2. HHQ Initiated Recall. This recall will be initiated by HHQ and involves
          every member logging on to the AFPAAS website (https://afpaas.af.mil) and
          accounting for themselves and their dependents. Results will be compiled by the AF
          Personnel Readiness Cell. Specific instructions should be included on all unit recall
          rosters under OPTION 6 Recall.
    13.4. Wing Recall Options
       13.4.1. OPTION 1: Commander’s Senior Staff (SS): “This is an Option 1 Senior Staff
       recall only. Senior Staff members (CC, CV, OG/CC, MSG/CC, MDG/CC, MX DIR,
       CCC, XP) report to Bldg. 344, Room 129D.” Additional personnel will be recalled as the
       situation dictates.
       13.4.2. OPTION 2: Crisis Action Team (CAT): “This is an Option 2 CAT recall. CAT
       members (SS, LRD, FSS, CES, CS, SFS, OSI, ATO, JA, SE, PA, CP, CPTS, WX,
       CONS, OSS, EOC DIR) report to Bldg. 344, Room 129D. Stand up GCCs and UCCs.”
       Additional personnel will be recalled as the situation dictates.
       13.4.3. OPTION 3: Emergency Operations Center (EOC): “This is an Option 3 EOC
       recall. EOC members report to Bldg. 344, Rooms 129B. Stand up GCCs and UCCs.”
       Units need only recall those personnel necessary to support this effort. ***Approval
       authority for this option is Incident Commander or MSG/CC or above.
       13.4.4. OPTION 4: Essential Military and Civilians Only: “This is an Option 4 recall.
       All essential military and government/ contractor civilians report to your duty station
       immediately. Stand up GCCs.” Group/Squadron Commanders, Directors and Agency
       Chiefs will determine who the essential military and civilians are within their respective
       organizations and recall as the circumstances dictate. Otherwise, complete your recall
       procedure responsibilities and remain at home on telephone standby. Each GCC will
       report recall status to the PRF (ext. 5809/4517) at Recall Initiation Time (RIT) +1 hour,
       RIT +2 hours, RIT +3 hours, and every 6 hours until 100% has been obtained.
       13.4.5. OPTION 4A: Base-Wide: “This is an Option 4A base-wide recall. All military,
       government civilian and contractor personnel report to your duty station immediately.
       Stand up GCCs.” Each GCC will report recall status to the PRF (ext. 5809/4517) at
       Recall Initiation Time (RIT) +1 hour, RIT +2 hours, RIT +3 hours until 100% has been
       obtained.
       13.4.6. OPTION 5: Base-Wide Accountability: “This is an Option 5 base-wide
       accountability recall. Complete your recall procedure responsibilities, but DO NOT
       report to your duty station.” Units will make telephone notifications to all assigned
       personnel, but will NOT recall them. Units will report results of the accountability recall
       to the appropriate Group Representative. Group Representatives will forward group
       results to the Command Post (ext. 5167) at Recall Initiation Time (RIT) +1 hour, RIT +2
       hours, RIT +3 hours until 100% has been obtained. If Higher Headquarters initiates
       accountability action via the Air Force Personnel Accountability and Assessment System
       (AFPAAS) for a specific Geographic Area of Interest (GAOI), which is not in the local
       area, individuals and their dependents determined to be in the GAOI must be added to the
       AFPAAS. Accountability will be complete only after all individuals and dependent’s
       whereabouts are confirmed. Squadron Representatives will contact unit members and
LAUGHLINAFBI10-202 14 MAY 2013                                                            9


     (or) family members to account for them and will update AFPAAS for the individuals
     accordingly. Once completed units will report results of AFPAAS to the appropriate
     Group Representative. Group Representatives will forward group results to the
     Command Post. In the event that Laughlin AFB is within the GAOI, members will log on
     to the AFPAAS system (https://afpaas.af.mil) and report their status (and that of their
     family members, if applicable) through the Airman/Civilian logon. If you do not have
     internet access, call your commander or supervisor or the Air Force Personnel Readiness
     Cell at 1-800-435-9941 or (210) 565-2020 or DSN 665-2020.
