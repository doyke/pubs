   Understanding (MOU) with their State agency responsible for environmental quality. For a
   sample MOU refer to DoDI 4000.19, Support Agreements.
   1.6.5. Prior to performing EOD procedures, response teams must positively identify and
   verify all ordnance in EOD technical data. (T-0) If no technical data exists for the item in
   question, use other means to identify ordnance. For EXAMPLE: X-rays can help identify
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                    17

Section 1C—Personnel

1.8. Administration of EOD Personnel:
   1.8.1. Qualifications. EOD Personnel must meet the requirements in the Officer
   Classification Directory and Enlisted Classification Directory as appropriate, and must be
   assigned to a valid EOD position on a Unit Manning Document (UMD) to perform EOD
   duties.
   1.8.2. Retrainee or Officer. For entry into this specialty as a retrainee or officer:
      1.8.2.1. Re-trainee and officer candidates must complete a 10-day EOD orientation visit
      with an operational Air Force EOD flight. If one is not located on station, the applicant's
      unit may fund a TDY to the nearest AF Base with an operational AF EOD Flight to
      complete the 10-day EOD orientation. If unit funds are not available a funding request to
      AFCEC/CXD may be accomplished. Because there is no guarantee that AFCEC/CXD
      will be able to fund the TDY, all efforts should be exhausted by the re-trainee or officer
      candidates unit prior to the request. The visit consists of 10 operational duty days to
      complete the EOD Orientation Checklist (Attachment 6) and submit with re-training
      application. Re-trainee and officer candidates must complete the EOD Retraining
      Volunteer Letter (Attachment 8) during the 10-day visit. The 10-day visit does not apply
      to AFRC personnel. All checklists will be sent to HQ AFPC or HQ ARPC once they are
      completed and signed by the unit. Prior to orientation visit, candidates must pass the
      Physical Ability and Stamina Test (PAST) to ensure minimum physical requirements can
      be met before allocating funding. (T-3)
      1.8.2.2. For Air National Guard personnel the following applies:
          1.8.2.2.1. Prior service individuals wishing to re-train upon entry into the ANG will
          complete the PAST test and the volunteer letter prior to their 10 day orientation. Both
          will be administered by the recruiter. (T-3)
20                                                             AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


         1.8.2.2.2. For ANG re-trainees, and prior-service re-trainees, the 10-day orientation
         will be performed with the gaining EOD flight over a consecutive number of days to
         include a drill weekend. (T-3)
         1.8.2.2.3. For officers wishing to cross-train into ANG EOD, they may be
         interviewed by a SNCO if no EOD-qualified officer is at the EOD flight or within the
         squadron where they are performing their 10-day orientation. A Letter of
         Recommendation or a Letter of Objection will be composed by the interviewer. (T-3)
         1.8.2.2.4. The completed package, to include the checklist and the interviewer’s
         letter, will be sent to the hiring CES/CC for final approval. If the re-trainee is hired,
         the CES/CC will send the completed package, along with a Letter of Approval to the
         HQ NGB/A7X, for final coordination. (T-3)
         1.8.2.2.5. The CES/CC will also send the completed package, their Letter of
         Approval, and the signed Volunteer letter to the Air Force Reserve Personnel Center.
         (T-3)
  1.8.3. Security Clearance. EOD Specialty requires access to Top Secret material or similar
  environment. For award and retention of AFSC 32E3H/K and 3E8XX, completion of a
  current Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) according to AFI 31-501, Personnel
  Security Program Management, is required.
  1.8.4. Volunteer. The EOD AFSC is high risk and as such, is a volunteer only career field.
  Members “MUST BE A VOLUNTEER” to enter the DoD Joint EOD Basic Common Core
  Course (Reference: Catalog of Navy Training Courses (CANTRAC): A-431-0134). All non-
  prior service Airmen, re-trainees, and officer candidates must complete the appropriate EOD
  volunteer letter (Attachment 7 or Attachment 8) prior to entering the EOD training pipeline.
  The signed volunteer letter must be held on file in the members Personal Information File.
  1.8.5. Withdrawal. If at any time an Airman feels he/she is incapable of performing the
  high risk duties related to the EOD mission, the member may withdraw their EOD volunteer
  letter. This will result in the member’s temporary disqualification from performing EOD
  duties and may result in the permanent removal from the EOD career field. Once withdrawn,
  at no time may the volunteer letter be reinstated. Individuals that request removal from the
  EOD Career Field for personal reasons, such as, incapability to perform EOD duties, will be
  permanently disqualified for EOD duties.
  1.8.6. Dress and Appearance. For award of the senior and master EOD badges to EOD-
  qualified CE Officers, the phrase "in the specialty" includes those jobs, which have
  responsibility for EOD in the areas of organize, train, and equip functions. Examples include
  CE or Emergency Services Squadron commander jobs in which individuals lead squadrons
  with EOD flights and MAJCOM CE Readiness Directorate/Division chiefs that have EOD
  under their leadership.
  1.8.7. Proficiency. EOD personnel must maintain competency in all aspects of the EOD
  mission. Completion of the minimum training requirements listed in the 3E8X1 Career Field
  Education Training Program (CFETP), Section G; AF EOD Standard Training Package, is
  required to maintain proficiency.
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                     21


   1.8.8. Suspension or Removal from EOD Duties and the EOD Flight. Because of the
   nature of EOD duties (working with live explosives, directly working on nuclear assets, and
   providing protective support to Presidential and DOS personnel), Airmen may be removed
   from EOD duties and the flight when they have documented negative quality force indicators
   or skill deficiencies that cause their reliability and judgment to be questionable. Airmen
   should be provided written notification and reason for removal. Removal from EOD duties
   by itself is neither an adverse personnel action nor the basis for disciplinary action and the
   suspension or removal from EOD duties is not a substitute for appropriate disciplinary or
   adverse personnel action. When making a removal determination, the issue is not an
   individual’s guilt or innocence of a particular offense, it is the safety of that individual and
   how that person may negatively affect himself, his fellow Airmen, or the mission. It is not
   necessary to complete an investigation, take disciplinary action, or to complete other
   personnel actions before determining to remove an individual from EOD duties.
      1.8.8.1. Removal may be appropriate based on a single serious incident or documented
      habitual minor incidents, reflecting behavior that is inconsistent with military standards,
      and raises questions about an individual’s reliability and judgment. The following
      examples may constitute grounds for suspension or removal from the flight:
          1.8.8.1.1. Any alcohol-related incident, alcohol abuse, alcohol dependency, misuse of
          prescription/controlled medications, or use of illegal substances.
          1.8.8.1.2. Significant delinquent financial obligations without cause.
          1.8.8.1.3. Negligence or delinquency in performing duties that reveals a lack of
          dependability, flexibility, good attitude, or good judgment.
          1.8.8.1.4. Arrest for, or conviction by a military or civilian court of, a serious
          offense; a series or arrests or court convictions for misdemeanor offenses; or more
          than one Article 15, which would indicate a pattern of conduct contrary to the
          standards required of EOD personnel.
          1.8.8.1.5. Any significant personal, physical, or medical condition determined to be
          prejudicial to reliable performance of EOD duties.
          1.8.8.1.6. Poor attitude or lack of motivation as evidenced by aberrant or irrational
          behavior, inappropriate behavior, or mood.
          1.8.8.1.7. Failure to maintain a proper grade/skill relationship.
          1.8.8.1.8. Failure to maintain fitness standards within AF regulations to a level
          required to conduct full spectrum EOD operations within CONUS, OCONUS, and
          contingency environments.
      1.8.8.2. Establishment of a Security Information File or suspension of access to
      classified information will result in temporary removal from EOD duties and the flight.
      Revocation of security clearance eligibility will result in disqualification from EOD
      duties and removal from the flight.
      1.8.8.3. When the conditions described in paragraph 1.8.8.1 occur, commanders may
      take the following actions:
    22                                                                AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


             1.8.8.3.1. Temporary suspension from duties and the EOD flight. Immediately
             suspend an individual for up to 180 days in order to determine whether, given the
             nature of the incident(s), the individual’s reliability and judgment meet the standards
             for reinstatement to EOD duties. This period of temporary suspensions may be
             extended as needed to determine suitability for reinstatement or permanent removal.
             1.8.8.3.2. Permanent disqualification of an individual from EOD duties. Situations
             such as, but not limited to, the following may warrant permanent disqualification:
             confirmed drug abuse, a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, a diagnosed psychiatric
             disorder that interferes with member’s ability to perform military duties, and
             imposition of more than one Article 15 within a short period of time. Commanders
             will seek legal advice before permanently removing an individual from EOD duties.1
             (T-1) Forward all requests for permanent disqualification to AFCEC/CXD. The
             request will include chain of command recommendations and all documentation that
             substantiates permanent disqualification.
             1.8.8.3.3. Reinstatement. A commander may request reinstatement of an individual’s
             qualification for EOD duties provided the reason or condition of the permanent
             disqualification no longer exists. Forward all requests for reinstatement to
             AFCEC/CXD. The request will include chain of command recommendations and all
             documentation that substantiated the permanent disqualification and documentation
             that supports the opinion that the condition or reason no longer exists.
         1.8.8.4. Appeal. An individual may appeal a permanent disqualification. Individuals
         must provide a written request for an appeal with rationale. Forward all appeal requests
         to AFCEC/CXD for AFCEC/CX approval or disapproval. The request will include chain
         of command recommendations and all documentation that substantiated the
         disqualification determination.
      1.8.9. Interruption in EOD duties. Enlisted EOD personnel must re-accomplish the basic
      EOD course when assigned 48 months or longer in a non-EOD position or if there is a 36-
      month or longer break in service. Under extenuating circumstances (i.e., if special EOD
      training or operations were accomplished during that time), this requirement may be fulfilled
      if the individual can be recertified on all CFETP Core Tasks (commensurate with grade/skill
      level).
         1.8.9.1. For RegAF forces, the AF EOD CFM, in consultation with the responsible
         MAJCOM, has waiver authority for this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
             1.8.9.1.1. The individual’s prior service EOD history will be evaluated to ensure the
             individual is qualified for EOD duties, meets criteria listed in Officer/Enlisted
             Classification Directory, and meets AF Quality Standards.
             1.8.9.1.2. Waiver authority for ARC forces is delegated to the ARC EOD Functional
             Managers.

             1.8.9.1.3. ARC EOD personnel who are excused from unit training assemblies [not
             constructively present] for six months or more will be recertified on all skill level
             tasks. As a minimum, a 623a entry into the member’s records would state the
             training was reviewed, and member is qualified to perform EOD duties.
    1.8.10. Re-training:
         1.8.10.1. Enlisted Airmen above the rank of SSgt are not accepted for retraining. EOD
         operations require experienced technical leadership.2
         1.8.10.2. ARC Airmen requesting entry into the EOD career field must be briefed by the
         local EOD team on career field mission, tools, equipment, physical requirements, and
         view the EOD recruiting video. This briefing must be documented on a memorandum for
         record.
    1.8.11. Incentive Pay. This section outlines service component requirements in compliance
    with DoD 7000-14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A, Military Pay
    Policy and Procedures – RegAF and Reserve Pay.
         1.8.11.1. EOD personnel in a valid EOD position receiving demolition pay must
         document monthly qualifications. (T-0)
         1.8.11.2. During periods of deployments and at locations where monthly qualification is
         not possible, MFM, or deployed EOD leadership may temporarily waive this requirement
         (see paragraph 3.11.1.2 through 3.11.1.2.2) by documenting dates, location, and either
         combat operations being performed, specific country restrictions, or other reasons why
         explosive operations may not be performed.
    1.8.12. HAZMAT Certification. EOD technicians will be certified as Hazardous Materials
    (HazMat) Awareness and Operations Core/Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) levels IAW
    29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120q by meeting the requirements provided in
    the National Fire Protection Association 472; Standard for Professional Competence of
    Responders to Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction Incidents (2013 Edition),
    Chapter 6, Competencies for Operations Level Responders Assigned Mission Specific
    Competencies, Section 6.9, Mission-Specific Competencies: Disablement/Disruption of
    IEDs, Improvised WMD Dispersal Devices, and Operations at Improvised Explosives
    Laboratories. (T-0)
    1.8.13. ANG Hazardous Duty Pay (HDP)- Demolition Duty. EOD members of the ANG
    Component who are in a pay status are entitled to incentive pay for HDP. Refer to DoD
    7000.14-R for specific compensation based on whether the member is on inactive duty
    training or activated on Title 10 orders.
    1.8.14. Dual Status Military Technician. Man-day orders (Title 10 status) are required for
    a dual status military technician (ANG/AFRC) for any activity that involves explosives,
    training with live explosives, any level 1 or 2 response off base, transporting hazardous or
    explosive materials on or off base, when required to provide response to emergencies (e.g.
    during duty hours and/or on EOD standby after normal duty hours), and VIPSSA; will be

   provided by the supporting MAJCOM or Directorate. EOD Flights will request enough days
   to cover the FY for Training, Operations, and conditions which require the dual status
   military technician (ANG/AFRC) to be on orders. (T-1)

Section 1D—Manning

1.9. Operational Manning Requirements.
   1.9.1. Deployment Coding (Unit Type Availability (UTA)). All EOD flight personnel will
   be coded DW except as noted below. The minimum Break-the-Flight positions at each
   RegAF EOD flight (6 at normal base, 8 at Custodial Units, 20 at Large Range base) will be
   coded DX. All AF EOD instructors (NAVSCOLEOD and Silver Flag) will be coded DX.
   EOD Staff positions at HQ USAF, AFCEC/CXD, MAJCOM and AFCEC/CXE will be
   coded DX. AFGSC flights will be coded DP to support OPLAN 8010 (BSART mission).
   ARC AGRs will be coded DX. HQ AFRC/A7CX and NGB/A7X will, in coordination with
   AF/A4CXR, HQ ACC/A7X (SuperFam), HQ AFPC/DPWS, and AFCEC/CXD, provide
   input for a posturing plan for the Active Guard Reserve (AGR) deployment schedule. All
   other EOD positions not addressed in this paragraph will be coded DX. This paragraph does
   not apply to EOD positions that are joint, owned by others, or classified. (T-1)
   1.9.2. Manpower Standard and Unit Personnel Management Roster (UPMR). The Air
   Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) for AF EOD is AFMS 44ED00 (This CMS is available
   electronically on the Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) website.). This CMS quantifies
   the Civil Engineer flight level manpower necessary to accomplish Air Force EOD tasks
   based upon the number and type of EOD UTC taskings.
      1.9.2.1. The Air Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) for ANG EOD is ANGMS 44ED00.
      This CMS quantifies the Civil Engineer flight level manpower necessary to accomplish
      fulltime Air National Guard EOD tasks.
   1.9.3. EOD Flight Posturing. Per the AF/A4C-approved EOD Optimization Plan, the EOD
   Air Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) structured EOD flights as large-range flights (54
   personnel), large force-projection flights (25 personnel), small force-projection flights (17
   personnel), and in-garrison flights (12 personnel). This manpower is a wartime structure and
   allows for enough EOD personnel at home station to support the ten mission areas and force
   protection. ARC EOD flights are structured as Homeland Defense flights (10-17 personnel).
      1.9.3.1. USAF EOD Minimum Sustainable Manpower. Ten personnel, 30 at large range
      flights, are required to meet all mission area requirements identified in AFPD 32-30.
      Minimum sustainable manpower provides a sufficient manpower structure to 1) maintain
      missions for an indefinite period of time; 2) provides the proper leadership & mentoring;
      3) and maintain required training proficiency. Up to three of these personnel (1 at
      Custodial Units) can be available to support VIPPSA and RST missions. The additional
      20 personnel at Large Range flights are required to maintain emergency response for
      range operations. Support for scheduled range clearances, as outlined in AFI 13-212,
      Range Planning and Operations, will require manning augmentation from other EOD
      flights. The numbers provided in this paragraph are not additive requirements and will
      not exceed the requirements provided in the CMS. If an EOD flight falls below
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                  25


      minimum sustainable manpower levels, a degraded capability exists and required
      proficiency training and certifications are difficult to maintain.
      1.9.3.2. AFRC Fulltime EOD Minimum Sustainable Manpower. Ten fulltime personnel
      are required to sustain all mission area requirements identified in AFPD 32-30, Explosive
      Ordnance Disposal and reflected in this AFI. A manpower structure of six personnel is
      only sufficient to provide limited mission areas support for a limited amount of time with
      only a single incident response capability. At no time will flight manning fall below six
      without MAJCOM concurrence. Reference para. 1.9.3.1. for manning requirements
      needed to support all mission areas identified within AFPD 32-30 and statement of
      conditions in AFMS 44ED.
      1.9.3.3. USAF EOD Minimum Break-the-Flight manpower.                        If, during
      contingency/wartime surge or emergency operations, an EOD flight falls below
      sustainable manpower, a degraded capability exists. The following applies to Break-the-
      Flight manpower:
         1.9.3.3.1. A manpower structure of 6-8 personnel is only sufficient to provide limited
         mission areas support and only a single incident response capability. At no time will
         flight manning fall below 6 (8 for Custodial Units, 20 at large range bases including
         manning or RST support) without MAJCOM concurrence. Custodial Units require 8
         personnel to ensure a minimum of 6 operational personnel for emergency response
         (accounts for temporary suspension from Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) due to
         medications or other reliability issues).
         1.9.3.3.2. Support for missions that are beyond emergency installation and force
         protection response (e.g., missions other than nuclear/strategic mission, force
         protection, and aircraft/munitions response) require risk management (RM)
         determination. At this level of manning, required training proficiency and
         certifications are difficult to maintain. Flights falling below minimum manning
         requirements for periods longer than 30 days should request manning assistance (term
         temp civilian/contractor support for program management support) through their
         respective MAJCOM functional manager.

Section 2C—Safety Programs

2.4. Weapons Safety. EOD requirements for Weapons Safety are covered in AFMAN 91-201,
Explosives Safety Standards and Technical Orders 60A-1-1-4, Protection of Personnel and
Property; 60A-1-1-22, EOD Disposal Procedures General EOD Safety Precautions; and other
applicable EOD publications relative to the operation to be conducted. When information
between these references conflict, always use the more stringent safety reference. Prior to the
start of all explosive operations on training, demolition, or bombing ranges the Team Leader
(TL) or a Team Member (TM) will complete the Standard Pre-Operation Safety Briefing located
in AFTTP 3-32.5, Volume 7, EOD Range Operations, and brief all individuals present during the
explosive operation using the completed form. (T-0)
   2.4.1. Proficiency Range Parameters. The authorized procedures on EOD ranges allow for
   reduced safe separation distances. Specifications for EOD proficiency ranges are listed in
   AFMAN 91-201. NEWQD calculations for training are only required when using explosives
   more powerful than Composition C-4. Ranges are sited for either 1.25, 2.5 or 5 lbs of C-4.
   2.4.2. Emergency Destruction on Established Ranges. In cases where the net explosive
   weight and fragmentation hazards exceed the established quantity-distance criteria for a
   range, obtain installation commander’s permission, perform RM, and use protective
   measures to ensure safe operations.
   2.4.3. EOD Training and Disposal Range Requirements. All EOD Proficiency Training
   Ranges will be cited IAW AFMAN 91-201 requirements. All Disposal Ranges will be cited
   IAW AFMAN 91-201 and AFTTP 3-32.5, Volume 7. (T-0)

   2.5.2. Respiratory Protection Program.
   2.5.3. Blood Borne Pathogen (BBP).
       2.5.3.1. With use of established control procedures (use of PPE and good hygiene);
       normal home-station EOD duties do not warrant participation in the BBP program.
       2.5.3.2. If local or deployed special EOD missions create a high potential for exposure to
       BBP, then EOD flights will coordinate with Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public
       Health flights to determine whether enrollment in this program is appropriate. (T-0)
       2.5.3.3. Refer to Title 29 CFR, Part 1910, subpart Z, Standard 1910-1030, Bloodborne
       Pathogens (29 CFR 1910-1030), for requirements on training and a written exposure

                              OPERATIONS AND TRAINING

Section 3A—Operational Parameters

3.1. General Response Actions
   3.1.1. Positive Identification. Responding EOD teams must positively identify all ordnance
   items prior to performing any EOD procedures. (T-0)
      3.1.1.1. All research and identification of ordnance items will be documented in EOD
      reports and verified as outlined in paragraph 3.7. (T-0) If unable to identify the ordnance
      item, the team must assume:
          3.1.1.1.1. It is the most hazardous type it could be.
          3.1.1.1.2. It has the most hazardous features/filler it could contain.
          3.1.1.1.3. It is in the most hazardous condition it could be in.
      3.1.1.2. EOD flights will put statements in their response guides that the team must
      positively identify ordnance using EOD technical data prior to performing any EOD
      procedures. If no technical data exists for the item in question, then other means will be
      used to identify ordnance. For EXAMPLE: x-rays could be used to help identify what
      type of filler is inside the ordnance and the type of fuzing or a request for information can
      be sent to the NSWC IHEODTD through AFCEC/CXE. The Joint EOD Technical
      Support Center is a resource available for assistance at 1-877-EOD INFO (1-877-363-
      4636). (T-0)
   3.1.2. EOD Technical Guidance. EOD procedures are conducted IAW Joint Service EOD
   60-series TOs. Supporting instructions such as 11-series TOs or DDESB Technical Papers
   (available at https://www.ddesb.pentagon.mil/documents/TechnicalPapers.aspx) may be
   used in absence of 60-series guidance. Additionally, basic EOD emergency response
   guidance is provided in Attachment 2, EOD Emergency Response Guidance. Local
   commanders have the authority and responsibility to make RM adjustment to established
   requirements so that mission requirements are met. (See AFI 90-802, Risk Management)
      3.1.2.1. Deviations from 60N series can be made with coordination and approval with
      MAJCOM and Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Nuclear
      Response/Planning Section, Military Liaison Branch. During accident response,
      deviations from 60N are obtained through the Nuclear Weapon Accident Response
      Procedures (NARP) weapon recovery process. By design, 60N series publications do not
      address all potential incident/accident scenarios. During an accident situation, EOD
      personnel in collaboration with DOE Accident Response Group (ARG) will develop a
      weapons recovery plan incorporating pertinent paragraphs from specific weapon 60N
      series tech order. (T-0)
   3.1.3. Medical Support. Medical support during high-explosives operations is a mandatory
   safety requirement per AFMAN 91-201. Medical support must remain in a designated safe
   area or outside of the hazard area unless required for injury/incident response. Medical
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                   31


   support may be military, civilian, or contracted as long as the qualifications are current and
   time criteria are met. (T-1)
      3.1.3.1. Medical personnel supporting explosive operations should receive
      familiarization training on the operation to be conducted. If onsite, medical support will
      be briefed on operations to be conducted and should assist in development of accident
      response plans.
      3.1.3.2. Explosive operations involving only demolition explosives (training) only
      requires medical support within a 30-minute response time. Trauma facilities should be
      available within 60 minutes via ground or air transportation.
      3.1.3.3. Explosives operations involving only practice munitions that include
      explosive/fire hazards (other than demolition explosives): An Emergency Medical
      Technician (EMT)-qualified technician must be available on-site or within a 30-minute
      response time. Trauma care should be available within 30 minutes and definitive care
      within 60 minutes via ground or air transportation. (T-0)
      3.1.3.4. Explosives operations involving live munitions (other than demolition
      explosives): An EMT-qualified technician should be available on-site during all
      operations. Trauma care should be available within 30 minutes and definitive care
      within 60 minutes via ground or air transportation. Additionally, flights should consider
      the need to bring an EMT during off-base emergency response. (T-0)
      3.1.3.5. EOD flights performing daily, multiple, simultaneous explosives operations
      involving live munitions should have an EMT-qualified technician dedicated/assigned to
      the EOD flight. EMT would be onsite or within 30-minute response time when
      simultaneous dislocated explosive operations are occurring. When simultaneous
      explosive operations occur, supplement the first EMT with an additional EMT-qualified
      technicians on-site at each operating site, e.g., one EMT is centrally located within 30-
      minutes with an EMT immediately available at each operating site. (T-0)
   3.1.4. Off-Installation Responses
      3.1.4.1. Military munitions and explosives response under Immediate Response
      Authority.
          3.1.4.1.1. The closest AF EOD flight is required to respond to accidents/incidents
          involving AF-owned EO on or off AF installations. The first service to discover an
          incident involving EO of another service or Federal agency must take immediate
          actions to prevent or limit damage or injury. Report any incidents occurring in
          another service's operational area according to the responsible service’s procedures.
          The closest EOD flight should respond immediately with the understanding that the
          responsible service retains operational control. After DoD arrives on scene, the
          various services can sort out responsibilities per AFJI 32-3002. (T-0)
          3.1.4.1.2. The first service to discover a transportation accident/incident involving
          federally owned or controlled EO must respond immediately, regardless of location.
          The EOD team should arrive on-scene as soon as possible (within 4 hours). Use the
    32                                                                     AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


             fastest mode of transportation available. The objective is to prevent or limit loss of
             life, injury, property damage, and minimize public inconvenience.3 (T-0)
         3.1.4.2. Non-military munitions and explosives.
             3.1.4.2.1. Civil authorities are primarily responsible for the safe handling and
             disposal of IED, non-military commercial explosives, or similarly dangerous articles
             located off DoD installations. See details for off-installation support in paragraphs
             7.2 and 7.3.
             3.1.4.2.2. Non-DoD toxic or hazardous materials are not taken to military
             installations for storage or disposal unless:
                 3.1.4.2.2.1. The situation is clearly an emergency or lifesaving operation.
                 3.1.4.2.2.2. Formal agreements exist with other Federal agencies.
         3.1.4.3. Reporting: EOD response, as well as Explosive Detector Dog response, is
         covered under DODI 3025.21, Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies,
         Enclosure 5. Under this section, it requires the National Joint Operations and
         Intelligence Center (NJOIC) and the FBI’s Strategic Information Operations Center be
         advised immediately of the recovery and disposition of military munitions, as well as
         responses to non-military munitions and explosives. DoD Components must report this
         response and submit a report to NJOIC within 72 hours.
             3.1.4.3.1. To meet this requirement, EOD flights will provide the Command Post the
             information in Figure 3.1. once the team returns to base. The Command Post
             processes this information IAW DSCA reporting requirements outlined in AFI 10-
             206, Operational Reporting, and DODD 3025.21. (T-0)

Figure 3.1. AF DSCA Template.

 NOTE: The first priority is an immediate response to the accident or incident. After DoD arrives on scene, the
various services can sort out responsibilities per AFJI 32-3002.
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                  33


          3.1.4.3.2. EOD must coordinate with their local Command Post to ensure the process
          is codified in local operational instructions and checklist. Attach report provided to
          Command Post in the EODIMS report. (T-2)
   3.1.5. Environmental Guidance. All AF EOD flights within the US and its territories must
   comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) EPA Military Munitions
   Rule, and other applicable state regulatory requirements. EOD Response Actions are
   conducted under authority of the “DoD Policy to implement the federal EPA Military
   Munitions Rule (MRIP),” 01 July 1998, Chapter 9, Emergency Response. The MRIP is very
   specific about the conduct of emergency response and EOD’s authority to conduct them. (T-
   0)
      3.1.5.1. In non-emergency situations, to ensure all legal requirements are met, EOD
      personnel must consult the Staff Judge Advocate and the installation CE environmental
      management function before destroying EO. (T-1) (See paragraph 3.2. for emergency
      response parameters.)
      3.1.5.2. The federal EPA has established definitions for when munitions become a waste
      and requirements for management of waste munitions.             These definitions and
      requirements are incorporated into RCRA’s implementing regulations. The federal
      program exempts EOD operations from some environmental management requirements
      during an EOD emergency response action for munitions and other explosive devices
      (military and non-military). The degree of exemption from federal RCRA regulations
      depends upon the level of response. However, states may have more stringent
      requirements than the federal regulations.
      3.1.5.3. The DoD has created two levels of EOD emergency response; immediate
      response (Level 1) and imminent and substantial endangerment (Level 2). The primary
      distinction between the two levels is that a Level 2 response can be delayed without
      compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
      environment.
          3.1.5.3.1. Treat all requests for EOD response as a Level 1 response until determined
          otherwise. From an explosives safety point of view, when EOD Teams are
          dispatched, the situation requires an immediate response.
          3.1.5.3.2. The on-scene EOD Team Leader determines if the situation requires a
          Level 1, Level 2, or no EOD emergency response. See Attachment 1 Terms for the
          definition of an EOD Team Leader.
          3.1.5.3.3. Only the senior on-scene EOD Team Leader can determine when the
          response action is complete. For a Level 2 response, temporary storage in a
          munitions storage facility should not terminate the emergency nature of the response
          – normally, wait for termination until final destruction or shipment to a destruction
          facility.
   3.1.6. EOD Response Time. EOD units will adhere to the following response time
   parameters when responding to all emergency incidents requiring EOD support. Exception:
   ANG EOD units will establish response time parameters with Wing leadership that will best
   support their Wing/local mission. (T-1)
    34                                                                  AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


         3.1.6.1. Normal duty hours: EOD teams will be en route to the incident site within 30-
         minutes of initial notification or within 30 minutes of approval from the Wing CC for
         “immediate response authority” support to DSCA. (T-1)
         3.1.6.2. Off duty hours: Unless required by Force Protection Condition, EOD flights are
         not manned for 24/7 operations and therefore provide standby teams for off-duty
         immediate response. The goal for any incident off-duty is to respond in the most
         expeditious manner while taking safety, road conditions and other factors into account.
         Taking these factors into account the goal for off-duty EOD team response is to be
         responding to the scene within 60 minutes after initial notification or within 60 minutes
         of approval from the Wing CC for "immediate response authority" support to DSCA.
3.2. Explosives or Munitions Emergency Response. Level 1 emergency response actions are
exempt from RCRA permitting, Department of Transportation (DOT) manifesting for movement
to a safe disposal area, and other substantive requirements under Title 40 CFR.4 However, Level
2 emergency response actions may be subject to emergency permitting and other requirements.
The installation environmental office will consider whether the following apply during an
emergency response: current permit requirements, applicable regulatory requirements, and
requirements in any applicable administrative agreement. The installation environmental office
should also consult with the installation SJA before contacting environmental regulators on the
need for an emergency permit or to comply with other applicable regulatory reguirements. (T-0)
      3.2.1. Level 1 Emergency Response (Immediate Response). A Level 1 Emergency could
      occur anywhere. A Level 1 Emergency requires immediate response activities to eliminate
      or address the actual or potential imminent threat to life, property, health, or the environment.
         3.2.1.1. A Level 1 Emergency exists if a delay in response activities would compromise
         safety or increase the risks posed to life, property, health, or the environment.5 A Level 1
         Emergency may exist if the risk associated with movement of the military munitions or
         other explosives involved is unknown or not acceptable. Or if the risk associated with the
         military munitions or other explosives temporary storage, or careful movement beyond a
         nearby, more isolated and protected location for immediate rendering-safe or destruction,
         is not acceptable.
         3.2.1.2. The lead on-site EOD Team Leader will, with regard to any explosive or
         chemical agent hazard presented: (a) determine whether a Level 1 Emergency exists, and
         (b) when to terminate a Level 1 Emergency response, or reclassify it to a Level 2
         response. Once the immediate hazards associated with military munitions or other
         explosives are eliminated, the supported installation or activity may have to perform
         other actions to address the impact of the response action. (T-0) (See paragraph 3.2.3.
         below.)

  NOTE: A reasonable delay in EOD's completion of an explosives or munitions emergency response that is caused
by necessary, unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstances does not automatically terminate a Level 1 Emergency.
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                   35


      3.2.1.3. EOD-conducted response actions during a Level 1 Emergency could involve
      defusing, detonation, or other actions to neutralize a munition “in-place,” or careful,
      limited movement to a nearby, more isolated and protected location, including to an
      operational range used by or limited to EOD operations, to defuse, detonate, or otherwise
      abate the immediate threat.
      3.2.1.4. Level 1 emergency response actions, where the response cannot be delayed
      without compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
      environment, are exempt from RCRA permitting, DOT manifesting for movement to a
      safe disposal area, and other substantive requirements.
          3.2.1.4.1. Level 1 EOD response actions are exempt from federal RCRA permitting
          requirements.
          3.2.1.4.2. Response may occur on-site or the item may be transported to a more
          secure location.
          3.2.1.4.3. No Hazardous Waste Manifest is required.
          3.2.1.4.4. Transporter of the item does not need a RCRA identification number.
          3.2.1.4.5. Item may be held in appropriate storage as a continuation of the response if
          a proper location for the response action is unavailable due to extenuating
          circumstances (e.g., adverse weather, nightfall, or other safety considerations).
          3.2.1.4.6. Storage location does not have to be a RCRA interim status or RCRA
          permitted facility or comply in any way with RCRA; however, it must comply with
          DDESB standards.
      3.2.1.5. Items such as UXOs, rendered-safe munitions, partial munitions, damaged, and
      broken munitions components will be destroyed by EOD under Level 1 response based
      on potential imminent threat at the earliest opportunity. (T-0) Only under rare exception
      would EOD turn-in munitions from a Level 1 response to munitions personnel. EOD
      team leaders who determine a Level 2 or non-emergency (turn-in for Designated
      Disposition Authorities (DDA) determination) approach to be more appropriate must
      document the reasons for their decision in the EODIMS report of the response.
   3.2.2. Level 2 Emergency Response (Imminent and Substantial Endangerment). A
   Level 2 Emergency also poses an actual or potential imminent threat to life, property, health,
   or the environment, but does not require immediate response activities to eliminate or address
   the actual or potential imminent threat. Level 2 Emergency response actions can generally
   be delayed for a reasonable period without adverse impact.
      3.2.2.1. A Level 2 Emergency exists if the response actions can be delayed without
      compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
      environment. A Level 2 Emergency may exist if:
          3.2.2.1.1. The risk associated with movement and temporary storage of the military
          munitions or other explosives involved is acceptable; and
          3.2.2.1.2. The military munitions or other explosives are positively identified, are
          safe for transport by explosives or munitions emergency response specialists, and can
          be stored (temporarily) within DoD munitions logistic management system pending
36                                                          AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


         appropriate response action (e.g., on-site destruction or movement to an appropriate
         destruction facility).
     3.2.2.2. The on-site EOD Team Leader will, with regard to the explosive or chemical
     agent hazard presented, determine: (1) whether a Level 2 Emergency exists; (2) when to
     terminate a Level 2 Emergency; and/or (3) when to re-classify a Level 2 Emergency (e.g.,
     risks become unacceptable) to a Level 1 Emergency. Once immediate hazards associated
     with military munitions or other explosives are eliminated, supported installation or
     activity may have to perform other actions to address impact of the response action. (T-
     0)
     3.2.2.3. The host installation's Environmental Office/Hazardous Waste Program
     Manager is responsible for consulting with the installation SJA and if appropriate
     environmental regulators to determine whether other regulatory requirements must be
     satisfied (e.g., a requirement to seek a RCRA emergency permit under section Title 40
     CFR Part 270.61) and to obtain requisite emergency transportation and/or treatment
     permits. (T-1) Emergency permits are usually granted orally with written follow-up.
         3.2.2.3.1. Off-base response permits. EOD flights should pre-coordinate local/state
         off-base permitting procedures with the installation environmental office. Under
         normal circumstances;
            3.2.2.3.1.1. If the EOD flight is responding to a military munition, then request
            the installation environmental office obtain necessary permits.
            3.2.2.3.1.2. If responding to other than a military munition, then the civil
            authorities requesting support are responsible for requesting the necessary
            permits.
         3.2.2.3.2. For items turned-in to the munitions storage area, the munitions activity
         will immediately request the installation environmental office obtain necessary
         permits and state notifications as required by local directives. (T-1)
     3.2.2.4. Items creating a Level 2 emergency normally include non-DoD (commercial or
     foreign) munitions found on base (FOB) or recovered from an emergency, and munitions
     that have been in the public domain and not been within the DoD logistics system (cannot
     track the type of environment and handling the item has been subjected to). These items
     are normally destroyed by EOD as a Level 2 response. They may be temporarily held in
     storage awaiting permits or other circumstantial requirements; but as a Level 2, DDA
     concurrence/ approval is not required for destruction. Coordinate with the base
     environmental function before conducting a level 2 response. Only under rare exception
     would EOD turn-in munitions from a Level 2 response to munitions personnel for DDA
     determination. EOD team leaders who determine a non-emergency (turn-in for DDA
     determination) approach to be more appropriate must document the reasons for their
     decision in the EODIMS report of the response and inform the local environmental
     and/or munitions storage functions as appropriate. (T-1)
  3.2.3. Site Remediation. EOD personnel do not conduct planned munitions responses;
  however, they will respond to explosives or munitions emergencies that occur during planned
  responses. (T-1) (See paragraphs 3.4.6.2.2., 3.4.6.2.3., 3.4.6.2.4., and 3.4.6.2.5.)
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                                       37


    3.2.4. Significant Disagreement. If, during an explosives or munitions emergency
    response, environmental regulators and safety officials have serious concerns about the
    potential impact of EOD proposed course of action on human health and environment, the
    following applies:
         3.2.4.1. By DoD policy, EOD personnel are not allowed to take any action inconsistent
         with approved EOD procedures or would place the EOD team at added risk.
         3.2.4.2. When a delay in conducting response activities will not compromise safety or
         increase risks, ensure protective measures are implemented until a mutually agreeable
         solution is reached.
         3.2.4.3. The environmental regulators or safety officials having serious concerns shall
         immediately elevate the concern to the next level of authority to attempt to achieve a
         mutually agreeable solution.
         3.2.4.4. Once an agreeable solution is attained, the appropriate DoD authority will
         coordinate EOD's support to resolve the emergency in a manner protective of human
         health and the environment, and that is consistent with EOD procedures.
    3.2.5. Response Records. Flights will ensure EOD response records and a copy of any
    supporting documentation such as an emergency permit (if issued) is entered into the
    EODIMS database.6 AFCEC/CXD manages the EODIMS per AFRIMS Table 33-49, Rule
    20.01. All requests for EODIMS data-pulls will be submitted directly to AFCEC/CXD.
    EODIMS report requests from United States Army Corps of Engineers representatives in
    support of remediation/recovery operations (Military Munitions Response Program
    (MMRP)) can come direct to AFCEC/CXD or through the units respective MAJCOM with
    the official USACE e-mail of the project representative requesting information. Requests

    Information Act (FOIA) request. (T-0)
3.3. Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) Support.
    3.3.1. EOD Capability.
         3.3.1.1. The four elements required to provide an EOD capability are:
             3.3.1.1.1. Transportation and specialized equipment sets.
             3.3.1.1.2. Explosives and demolition material.
             3.3.1.1.3. Joint-service technical data and viewing/communications set.
             3.3.1.1.4. EOD-qualified personnel/teams.
         3.3.1.2. EOD UTCs must have the capability to be fully mobile on initial deployment
         into any contingency. This requires vehicles to be part of EOD equipment UTCs so that
         all equipment and explosives can be loaded on a vehicle for transport. An EOD

  NOTE: Under 40 CFR §264.1(g)(8)(iv), the responding military emergency response specialists’ unit must retain
records for 3 years identifying the dates of the response, the responsible persons within the unit involved, the type
and description of material addressed, and its disposition. However, the DoD Military Munitions Response
Program requires retention of a permanent record of EOD responses for future land restoration and remediation
prior to release of DoD lands to the public.

     capability does not exist without the ability to respond with necessary vehicles,
     equipment, communications, and explosives.
  3.3.2. Core Unit Type Code (UTC). The AF uses EOD UTCs in peace and war to provide
  CCDR with an EOD capability. The WMP-1 provides details of required UTCs, support-
  levels, and structure for differing threat-levels. Flights should request current copies of the
  WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 (EOD) from their wing plans office (XP) or MAJCOM A5
  representative.
     3.3.2.1. Each UTC has MISCAPs that provide UTC limitations and capabilities
     (available on the Civil Engineer Center Expeditionary Engineering SharePoint® site at
     https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-

     3.3.2.2. Core UTCs are designated as Lead team and Base support (follow on). Two
     Lead UTC can support one lead flying squadron for 24-hour operations without
     augmentation. Base-support UTCs augment additional missions and other non-tactical or
     notional requirements.
  3.3.3. Joint EOD Operations.
     3.3.3.1. Refer to Joint service EOD Multi-service, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
     (MTTP), for the EOD Planning Checklist for Joint Operations
     3.3.3.2. A theater combat mission may best be supported by a joint EOD structure.
     Details for supporting joint EOD operations are in AF Tactics, Techniques, and
     Procedures (Interservice) (AFTTP(I)) 3-2.32, MTTP for EOD in a Joint Environment.
  3.3.4. Employing/Deploying Recently Graduated EOD Personnel.
     3.3.4.1. EOD Apprentices (AFSC 3E831) are not deployment-eligible unless they have
     completed all requirements below:
         3.3.4.1.1. Completed all volumes of their CDC and the end-of-course (EOC) test, and
         have been trained and certified on 100-percent of the core task items in the CFETP.
         3.3.4.1.2. EOD Journeymen and Craftsmen will not be tasked to train 3-skill level
         Airmen while directly supporting combat operations. To do so places junior Airmen
         and the entire EOD team at increased risk of injury/loss of life. (T-3)
     3.3.4.2. Under special circumstances, EOD Apprentices will be employed at locations
     with less risk where EOD persons with more developed experience and skills can train
     them prior to being assigned to locations of higher intensity. (T-3)
     3.3.4.3. After graduation from EOD basic school, an EOD Officer (AFSC 32EH) is not
     deployment-eligible until cleared by their MAJCOM MFM to deploy.

Section 3B—EOD Missions
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                     39


3.4. Mission Areas. To ensure an Air Force EOD capability is maintained, all EOD units will
organize, train, and equip to conduct or support the following ten (10) mission areas per AFPD
32-30, Explosive Ordnance Disposal. These mission areas are not listed in operational priority.
The priorities are relative to each base and will vary based on real-time situations and events.
Thus, EOD units must plan support for all mission areas with funding, manpower, equipment,
and training. Reference paragraph 3.1.6 through 3.1.6.2 for response time requirements. (T-0)
   3.4.1. Aerospace Systems/Vehicles and Conventional Munitions. This mission supports
   sortie generation and space operations by responding to airfield emergencies to render safe
   ordnance and aircraft during in-flight and ground emergencies or crash situations.
   Additionally EOD provides evaluation, diagnosis, render safe, recovery, and final disposal of
   conventional munitions involved in accident/incident.
       3.4.1.1. EOD personnel are not end-of-runway crews; however, they should be familiar
       with communicating with and operating around running fixed-wing and rotary-winged
       aircraft. Periodic (annual) training with these crews can be beneficial experience for EOD
       personnel.
       3.4.1.2. EOD teams respond when End-of-Runway crews or transient alert personnel are
       unavailable and/or when the aircraft/munitions system is in a hazardous condition.
       3.4.1.3. Refer to EOD Aerospace Vehicle CONOPS for more details.
       3.4.1.4. EOD teams are a critical and integral part of the initial response and accident
       investigation team. Until all ordnance has been rendered safe or cleared from the
       accident site, EOD personnel must be present during any entry to the crash site by all
       DoD agencies.
   3.4.2. Counter-IED (CIED). Eliminate or mitigate explosive hazards and terrorist/criminal
   devices, to include missions outside the base boundary or Base Security Zone (BSZ) to
   enable greater freedom of maneuver for air or surface operations. Perform IED defeat
   actions to include (but not limited to) the following: recover/destroy weapon caches;
   perform immediate actions to defeat emplaced IEDs; conduct post-blast analysis of IED
   events; provide military authorities with technical intelligence, analysis and exploitation; and
   provide key insights to enable development of CIED tactics, techniques and procedures to
   mitigate IED effectiveness.
       3.4.2.1. EOD teams do not perform searches in support of bomb-threats.
       3.4.2.2. Use diagnostics and remote procedures first: Hand-entry is a last resort.
       3.4.2.3. Use all available protective gear (e.g., bomb suit).
       3.4.2.4. Refer to the IED CONOPS for more details.
       3.4.2.5. EOD teams are not responsible for the custody of explosive material during
       criminal investigations.
   3.4.3. Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). During contingencies, EOD
   forces provide full-spectrum response capability to nuclear, biological, chemical,
   radiological, incendiary, conventional explosive ordnance and IEDs.
       3.4.3.1. Peacetime EOD force WMD response efforts are limited in scope to provide
       initial threat confirmation, risk mitigation, and situational awareness through passive
40                                                            AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


     diagnosis only. However, EOD forces may also provide additional technical support as
     required.
     3.4.3.2. Refer to the DoD CWMD CONOPS(S) and the EOD AFTTP for more details.
  3.4.4. Nuclear Weapon Response. All RegAF EOD flights, and ARC EOD units with
  primary installation response requirements, will provide immediate initial support to nuclear
  weapon accidents or incidents in order to mitigate risk, provide site stabilization and
  situational awareness. (T-0)
     3.4.4.1. All RegAF EOD flights, and ARC EOD units with primary installation response
     requirements, maintain certification to provide emergency nuclear support. Flight
     personnel maintain technical data and are trained to perform those actions necessary to
     support an Initial Response Force (IRF).
     3.4.4.2. Flights at Custodial Units maintain technical data and are qualified in all aspects
     of assigned weapon systems (see paragraph 3.12.5).
     3.4.4.3. Custodial Units certified on specific weapon systems and aerospace platforms
     form the core of weapons recovery teams and must respond in conjunction with the
     Tactical Response Force (TRF) to explosively defeat assault obstacles, conduct passive
     diagnostics and provide technical assessments. This is accomplished through secure
     communications with National Render Safe assets while supporting the National Military
     Command Center, Response Task Force (RTF), and/or the Lead Federal Agency during
     an incident/accident or recapture/recovery efforts.
  3.4.5. Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO) Recovery Operations. AF EOD Base
  Operating Support (BOS) units provide emergency response to neutralize hazards from
  incidents involving explosives that present a threat to operations, installations, personnel or
  materiel. This includes, but is not limited to, evaluation of individual ordnance items,
  support of developmental and operational ordnance/weapons system testing, and large-scale
  recovery of airbases denied by ordnance (RADBO) operations. See UXO-related mission
  details under paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2.
  3.4.6. Operational Range Clearance. EOD flights will clear active bombing and gunnery
  ranges of explosive hazards in support of range management offices to enhance safety of
  aircrew and ground forces training operations, as well as range maintenance activities. The
  following paragraphs outline policy and procedures for EOD support to operational ranges,
  other-than operational range support, and non-emergency requests for demolition support to
  MMRP operations: (T-0)
     3.4.6.1. Operational Range Clearance Support. EOD flights will work with range
     management offices and environmental agencies to clear operational ranges and test and
     evaluation ranges. This section outlines service component (EOD) requirements of DoDI
     3200.16, Operational Range Clearance, and DoDI 4140.62, Management and
     Disposition of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). Further
     implementing guidance is provided in AFI 13-212 and the EOD Range CONOPS/AFTTP
     on the AF EOD Program Management SharePoint® site https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-
     EN-CE-A6/21340/OO-EN-CE-49/SitePages/Home.aspx). (T-0)
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                  41


         3.4.6.1.1. UXO clearance procedures at operational ranges are different from those
         for environmental UXO remediation, and more closely mirror combat EOD duties
         and provide war skills experience for EOD operations. As in combat UXO area
         clearance, peacetime range clearance is usually only a surface clearance. At
         operational test and evaluation ranges, there are requirements for the sub-surface
         recovery of (sometimes deeply buried) experimental ordnance.
      3.4.6.2. Other-than Operational Range Support.
         3.4.6.2.1. EOD flights will not normally perform, nor are they responsible for,
         activities outside the scope of AFI 13-212 in relation to any range or other munitions
         response site. The AF EOD program is not equipped, trained, or manned for
         environmental requirements-based munitions response operations.
         3.4.6.2.2. Non-emergency or planned support on other than operational ranges is
         outside the scope of core competencies for EOD personnel. The below listed duties
         are examples of tasks EOD personnel should not be responsible for:
             3.4.6.2.2.1. Third-party quality assurance evaluations of contracts.
             3.4.6.2.2.2. Natural & cultural environmental escorts.
             3.4.6.2.2.3. Research and provision of ordnance information (other than
             emergency response).
             3.4.6.2.2.4. Construction support.
             3.4.6.2.2.5. Sub-surface UXO recovery (e.g., area remediation that is not in
             support of ordnance RDT&E/Operational Training and Exercise (OT&E)).
             3.4.6.2.2.6. Contract oversight.
             3.4.6.2.2.7. Lend-lease-grant final land clearance subsequent to land use by
             commercial ventures.
             3.4.6.2.2.8. Final land-surveys required prior to closure or re-characterization of
             operational ranges.
         3.4.6.2.3. MAJCOM EOD staffs may authorize performance of the above tasks for
         unique individual situations/operations when it provides a war skills benefit.
         Parameters should be established in a supplement to this AFI and in individual
         memorandums between the contract executing agent, flight involved, and MAJCOM
         EOD staff. Courtesy copy AFCEC/CXD on such memoranda.
         3.4.6.2.4. Emergency support to other than operational range activities is part of the
         core competencies for EOD personnel. Upon proper notification, EOD teams
         respond to any munitions emergency
             3.4.6.2.4.1. To ensure Public Safety.
             3.4.6.2.4.2. To identify unknown munitions.
             3.4.6.2.4.3. When there are possible chemical munitions involved (limited to
             emergency actions prior to arrival of specialized teams).
42                                                           AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


        3.4.6.2.5. EOD flights will provide a one-time response to first found munitions or
        other emergency support as outlined in a MAJCOM EOD staff-coordinated
        memorandum of agreement (MOA) or other coordinating document. The MOA will
        include as a minimum a request to provide full support and the required amount of
        resources (equipment, explosives, personnel, time). A copy of the completed MOA
        should be provided to AFCEC/CXD to ensure proper coordination and appropriate
        support is identified. (T-1) Also consider the following:
           3.4.6.2.5.1. Specific responsibilities provided (EPA permits, security, medical
           etc.).
           3.4.6.2.5.2. Specific responsibilities/duties military is to perform/conduct.
           3.4.6.2.5.3. Support provided under immediate response authority should be
           provided on a cost-reimbursable basis, where appropriate or legally required.
     3.4.6.3. Non-emergency Requests for Demolition Support to MMRP Operations. EOD
     flights will not support non-emergency MMRP operations unless they are pre-
     coordinated with the EOD flight and MAJCOM EOD functional manager as outlined
     below: (T-1)
        3.4.6.3.1. EOD Flights and MAJCOM EOD staffs will give consideration to MMRP
        demolition support that is within, or contiguous to, the installation. The decision to
        support these operations will be measured against current manning, upcoming
        deployments, operations, formal/core proficiency training, exercises, TDY schedules,
        and demolition explosives availability. (T-1)
        3.4.6.3.2. EOD support is limited only to the destruction by demolition of
        unexploded military ordnance located on the surface of the ground. EOD teams will
        not assist in the investigation of subsurface anomalies identified by geological
        equipment regardless of the number of anomalies at the munitions response site
        (MRS). (T-1)
        3.4.6.3.3. When installation EOD units are performing demolition support during
        MMRP projects on an “as needed” basis, coordination with the MMRP project lead is
        required to determine liability for damages should they occur based on EOD actions.
        (T-1)
        3.4.6.3.4. The MMRP project should reimburse installation EOD units for all assets
        consumed (explosives, equipment, etc.). Appropriate labor costs for EOD support to
        MMRP projects are reimbursable.
        3.4.6.3.5. If the EOD flight and MAJCOM determine that MMRP demolition support
        can be provided, an MOA between AFCEC/AZTQ and the installation will be
        developed to outline areas where the EOD unit can best support the customer and
        functional areas. AFCEC/CXD will assist with the development of the MOA. All
        MOAs regarding EOD demolition support to MMRP must be coordinated with
        AFCEC/CXD prior to implementation.
           3.4.6.3.5.1. Coordination will be documented within the MOA with the
           applicable authoritative parties, i.e. EOD Flight Management, owning unit
           commander, and MAJCOM EOD functional area manager and AFCEC/CXD.
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                  43


          3.4.6.3.5.2. A copy of the completed MOA should be provided to AFCEC/CXD to
          ensure proper coordination and appropriate support is identified.
   3.4.7. Mortuary Services. Removal and safing of ordnance left on or embedded in
   casualties. Refer to the Mortuary Support CONOP for details on the AF EOD Program
   Management SharePoint® site https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-A6/21340/OO-EN-
   CE-49/SitePages/Home.aspx. This mission area includes support to JPAC joint field
   activity mission.
   3.4.8. Defense Support to Civil Authorities. Assist Federal and civil authorities with
   terrorist or other criminal acts, accidents, found explosive items and other requests for
   support. This mission regards “Immediate Response Authority” operations as outlined in
   DoDD 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA); DODI 3025.21, AFPD 10-8,
   Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA), and AFI 10-801, Defense Support of Civil
   Authorities (DSCA). See Chapter 7 for detailed guidelines on general support to civil
   authorities.
   3.4.9. Irregular Warfare (IW). EOD teams will serve as combat enablers to General
   Purpose and Special Operations Forces in execution of various IW missions to include
   security force assistance, counterinsurgency (COIN), stability operations, and building
   partnership capacity. (T-0)
   3.4.10. VIP Protective Support. Support to the USSS and US DOS VIPPSA taskings.
   EOD flights will provide counter-explosive search teams in support of the U.S. Secret
   Service (USSS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State
   (DoS).    This section outlines service component requirements in DoDD 3025.13,
   Employment of DoD Capabilities in Support of the United States Secret Service, and DoDI
   3025.19, Procedures for Sharing Information With and Providing Support to the U.S. Secret
   Service (USSS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Detailed procedures of support
   are provided in the USSS Hazardous Device Counter-Measures Manual (HDCM). (T-0)
      3.4.10.1. Reimbursement for VIPPSA support. Public Law 94-524, Presidential
      Protection Act of 1976, establishes the authority for non-reimbursable DoD support to the
      USSS for protection of the President, Vice-President, or other officer immediately next in
      order of succession to the office of the President. Lack of funding is not a reason for
      non-support of Presidential and Vice- presidential protective mission taskings. All other
      VIPPSA taskings are reimbursable.
      3.4.10.2. If the personnel are available without impacting the flight’s ability to perform
      its primary mission, then a VIPPSA tasking must be supported. (T-0) (See paragraph
      1.9.3.2 to determine availability of personnel.)
      3.4.10.3. Coordinating Support. US Northern Command (US NORTHCOM) is
      designated as the executive agent for all routine (25 teams or less) VIPPSA taskings from
      the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), in support of the USSS and DOS. They
      task and coordinate all routine missions by DoD EOD personnel, regardless of service
      affiliation, through the USNORTHCOM JEODVIPPSA.
      3.4.10.4. NSSEs: The USSS requests assets via a Request for Assistance (RFA) to OSD
      EXECSEC, then it is sourced through the Request For Forces (RFF) process from
      NORTHCOM to the Joint Staff and finally published in an order.
    44                                                                      AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


               3.4.10.4.1. JEODVIPPSA provides AFCEC/CXD the AF fair share of joint tasking
               requirements.
               3.4.10.4.2. AFCEC/CXD establishes MAJCOM distribution of the requirement,
               coordinates the required support, consolidates the team information, and provides the
               consolidated roster to JEODVIPPSA, AF/A4CXR and AFCEC/CXD.
           3.4.10.5. Approval Authority. Approval authority rests with the MAJCOM EOD
           functional manager. Approval for ANG EOD support, before mobilization, rests with the
           individual state adjutant general.
           3.4.10.6. All MAJCOMs:
               3.4.10.6.1. Designate a 24/7 POC with contact information to AFCEC/CXD.
               3.4.10.6.2. Coordinate and facilitate VIPPSA support missions with flights.
               3.4.10.6.3. Ensure EOD personnel comply with mission requirements.
               3.4.10.6.4. Promptly send team composition back to AFCEC/CXD.
           3.4.10.7. EOD Personnel Requirements:
               3.4.10.7.1. Minimum Team Criteria.
                    3.4.10.7.1.1. Team Member: Officer/Enlisted – Six months in-place, assigned to
                    the flight, and (enlisted only) satisfactory progress in upgrade training.
                    3.4.10.7.1.2. Team Leader: Officer/Enlisted – Officer: Six months in-place,
                    assigned to the flight, has performed two missions as a Team Member; Enlisted:
                    60 days in place, has performed two missions as a team member, 7-Skill level or
                    satisfactory progress in 7-Skill level upgrade training, assigned to the flight.
           3.4.10.8. See paragraph 2.2. for security requirements.
           3.4.10.9. EOD personnel receive a civilian clothing allowance while supporting USSS or
           DoD missions. AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowance for Air Force Personnel, specifies
           authorized amounts, how to apply, and how to get reimbursement.                    Flight
           commanders/chiefs selecting personnel for support missions should first consider sending
           individuals already receiving a civilian clothing allowance.7
           3.4.10.10. EOD personnel supporting VIPPSA Presidential or Vice Presidential taskings
           do not fall under the Presidential Support Program, unless such support exceeds 180

                  the criteria in paragraph 1.8.1., the DD Form 2335 will be mailed back to
                  VIPPSA. The flight is not authorized to destroy credentials locally.8 (T-0)
              3.4.10.12.2. Keep complete records of receiving receipts for individuals’ credentials,
              pins, and HDCM manuals. (T-0)
              3.4.10.12.3. Flights will provide their MAJCOM with a complete inventory of pins,
              credentials, and official passports in their possession semiannually (Jan/July) by
              sending a signed letter to their MAJCOM individually accounting for all items.
              MAJCOMS will consolidate all letters and forward to JEODVIPPSA. (T-2)
              3.4.10.12.4. Due to the access a pin affords the bearer, do not use or carry them
              except while supporting a VIPPSA mission. During the mission, personnel will not
              leave credentials or pins unattended in hotel rooms and will keep them in possession

          3.4.10.13.3. Mission Support. Flights shall not cancel EOD support to scheduled
          missions (see paragraph 1.6.18.2 and 1.6.18.5). (T-1) [e.g., JPAC, operational range
          support, and/or flying missions]
          3.4.10.13.4. Formal EOD Training. Scheduled PME and formal EOD training
          classes (AIEDDs, JNEOD, ECAC, etc.) are not to be cancelled in order to accept
          additional VIPPSA missions. Flights shall forecast and fill SORTS requirements (e.g.,
          Range Support Tasking (RST) and Silver Flag) as well as other EOD qualification
          and proficiency training schedules prior to providing availability for VIPPSA White
          House Complex (WHC) Support missions (see paragraph 1.6.17.3). (T-1)
          3.4.10.13.5. Inspections, Exercises, and Local Requirements. MAJCOMs should
          provide guidance to their installations concerning the priority and/or RM of
          MAJCOM and Wing activities (e.g., local inspections, exercises, and other ancillary
          training) and personal leave with respect to VIPPSA taskings.
3.5. Command Unique Missions.
   3.5.1. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC).                 Refer to PACAF mission
   guidelines for details (HQ PACAF/A4/7ZS).
3.6. Incident Command System.
   3.6.1. AF Incident Management System (AFIMS).
      3.6.1.1. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 directed the implementation of the
      National Response Framework (NRF) through the NIMS. The AF chose to develop the
      AFIMS for implementation of the NRF and the NIMS. In the AFIMS structure, EOD
      falls under Emergency Support Function (ESF) 5 and Operations Section for down range
      activities. Within the FEMA NRF structure, explosive device operations support ESF 10
      and 13.
      3.6.1.2. The AFIMS is outlined in AFI 10-2501. All EOD managers and Team Leaders
      must be familiar with AFIMS. (T-1)
3.7. Incident Reporting.
   3.7.1. Service EODIMS Incident Reporting.
      3.7.1.1. Do not enter Restricted Data or Personal Identifiable Information (PII) into
      EODIMS. (T-0) Refer to TO. and paragraph numbers only.
      3.7.1.2. EOD flights will use the EODIMS Operations Module, Incident Reporting
      System to gather and report information regarding EOD operations to their respective
      MAJCOMs. Flights submit incident reports within 5 working days after response
      termination with the exception of DSCA and DSCLEA which requires finalization in 72
      hours (15 working days for EOD range clearance reports). The emergency status of the
      EODIMS report is category level two (C-2) and requires continued normal reporting
      during emergency conditions. (T-1)
      3.7.1.3. Responding EOD teams will list the individual who positively identified the
      ordnance in the EODIMS incident report. The Team Leader will validate the
      identification. This process is accomplished using the drop down menus provided in the
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                     47


      EODIMS. If the Team Leader is the one who identifies the ordnance, a different EOD
      Team Member will verify and be listed on the EOD report (see paragraph 3.1.1). (T-1)
      3.7.1.4. MAJCOM managers use EODIMS Incident Reports to analyze trends, identify
      deficiencies, plan training, and project future activities in all aspects of the EOD program.
      MAJCOMs will review and approve all EODIMS Incident Reports within 5 working
      days from date received from flights.
      3.7.1.5. Flights should avoid the use of “thermal treatment” and “disposal” (in relation to
      the emergency destruction of UXO and other hazardous explosive devices) in written
      EOD reports because the environmental interpretations of these terms have specific
      meaning and consequences under the RCRA that may impose additional requirements on
      the USAF.        The suitable language for EOD explosive operations includes:
      “destroy/destruction” or “detonate/detonation” or even “blown-in-place” (BIP). Consult
      with the installation SJA if questions exist as to the status of a munition under 40 CFR
      Part 266, Subpart M, or under an applicable state regulation.
      3.7.1.6. EODIMS shares response information (e.g., IED, post-blast, UXO, area
      clearance, etc.) with the Joint Digital Information Gathering System (JDIGS) Program.
      This is covered in the EODIMS CONOPS.
   3.7.2. EOD Significant Event/Response Reporting. At times there are EOD response
   incidents that are significant enough to warrant immediate notification to the EOD flights’
   MAJCOM and possibly the entire AF EOD community. Discovery of chemical ordnance
   will be reported IAW AFI 16-609, United States Air Force Implementation of and
   Compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, and AFI 10-206.
      3.7.2.1. To ensure reporting continuity, the following guidelines must be followed when
      any of the following significant EOD emergency events result in:
          3.7.2.1.1. An inadvertent release of munitions from aircraft.
          3.7.2.1.2. Loss of life or lost time injury due to an EOD related event.
          3.7.2.1.3. Injury to EOD personnel occurred during the emergency operation.
          3.7.2.1.4. Adverse public reaction.
          3.7.2.1.5. Mutual aid responses that require extensive use of personnel or equipment
          to render safe or dispose of hazardous explosive item, assist in mass injury or casualty
          recovery, or have significant public impact potential.
      3.7.2.2. Initial Notification Methods: Within 6 hours of the beginning of a significant
      EOD emergency event, provide notification to AF/A4CXR, AFCEC/CXD, and
      MAJCOM EOD staff by phone (after duty hours) or email (during duty hours).
          3.7.2.2.1. During normal duty hours (0730-1600 Eastern Standard Time), the
          MAJCOM, Field Operating Agency (FOA), or base EOD flight will up-channel
          information      by    email   (designate    as    high    importance)     to
          AFCEC.CXD.WorkFlow@Tyndall.AF.Mil. Attach the report generated by the
          EODIMS, if available. When email is not immediately available, summarize the
          report by phone to an AFCEC/CXD staff member at DSN or commercial number, and
48                                                          AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


        refer to the AF EOD Program Management SharePoint® for contact information
        using priority precedence. (T-3)
        3.7.2.2.2. After normal duty hours (1600-0730 Eastern Standard Time), the
        MAJCOM, FOA, or base EOD flight will send an email as indicated in 3.7.2.2. The
        individual will then summarize the EOD report to an AFCEC/CXD staff member
        telephonically, reference the contact information available on the AF EOD Program
        Management SharePoint®.
        3.7.2.2.3. AFCEC/CXD notifies AF/A4CX of significant EOD events.
     3.7.2.3. Interim Updates. The EOD Flight Chief ensures that the MAJCOM and an
     AFCEC/CXD staff member are simultaneously notified of significant events in progress
     for more than six hours, or when such events have not concluded within 12 hours.
     3.7.2.4. Final Notification by Email. Within 12 hours following a significant EOD
     event, the EOD Flight Chief coordinated through the Base Civil Engineer (BCE), will
     email the MAJCOM EOD office and AFCEC.CXD.WorkFlow@Tyndall.AF.Mil. If
     possible, attach the complete EOD report to this email. (T-3)
     3.7.2.5. Final Report. The EOD Flight Chief, will complete a report as stated in
     paragraph 3.7.1 through EODIMS. (T-0)
  3.7.3. SORTS Report. Reported IAW AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training
  System.
     3.7.3.1. It is the EOD flight management’s responsibility to ensure manpower,
     equipment and training status is updated in SORTS, normally on a monthly basis in
     coordination with the Emergency Management Flight, or whenever significant changes
     occur.
     3.7.3.2. Since the results of individual flight SORTS reports are visible at the Joint
     Service level, inputting data accurately is critical for high level decision making. EOD
     flights will have access to ACES Resource Management (ACES-RM) and work closely
     with squadron SORTS monitor to correct inaccurate information. (T-1)
     3.7.3.3. Descriptions should be detailed enough to identify what is missing/causing the
     rating, what needs to be done to fix or mitigate the problem, and a reasonable expected
     completion date.
  3.7.4. AEF Reporting Tool (ART).
     3.7.4.1. It is the EOD flight management’s responsibility to ensure ART accurately
     reflects status of UTCs. Review and make changes monthly or within 24 hours when
     status changes. AEF Center and MFM rely on the accuracy and currency of reporting to
     make critical AEF sourcing decisions.
        3.7.4.1.1. Code Green. Equipment – 100 percent of required equipment and vehicles
        are on hand. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient with no rank/skill

             accomplish its mission. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient using
             allowable rank/skill level substitutions.9
             3.7.4.1.3. Code Red. Equipment – some or all of equipment is missing and the UTC
             cannot perform its mission. Personnel – Any position is vacant or any personnel lack
             proficiency per paragraph 1.8.2.
        3.7.4.2. All UTCs coded Yellow or Red will have comments explaining why their status
        is downgraded. (T-1)
    3.7.5. All EOD flights will conduct a Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS)
    assessment in accordance with AFI 10-252, Defense Readiness Reporting System.

Section 3C—EOD Training

3.8. Training Overview. The AF EOD Training Program aims to produce professional, highly
qualified, technically proficient EOD teams capable of safely and efficiently performing
peacetime and wartime EOD missions. EOD proficiency training enables EOD teams to achieve
and maintain a level of competency to safely and effectively deal with explosive hazards.
    3.8.1. Qualification Level. EOD team members must be trained to a knowledge level
    sufficient to determine and observe correct safety requirements needed before and during
    reconnaissance, and obtain the information necessary to positively identify ordnance items,
    formulate an appropriate render safe or disposal plan, and effectively execute those plans.
    3.8.2. Need for Practical Training. Hands-on practical training is necessary for required
    proficiency. EOD team members meet acceptable performance standards, through the use of
    applicable publications and training aids by correctly performing EOD procedures without
    committing errors that degrade safety and risk injury.
        3.8.2.1. Live-Explosive Training. Monthly live-explosive training is a critical
        component of EOD proficiency. EOD personnel will participate in monthly training
        involving the use of cartridge-actuated tools, demolition explosives, or pyrotechnic
        devices used to perform render-safe procedures (RSP) or general demolition using live-
        explosives. Training should include practical (hands-on) training for all team members
        utilizing flight training explosive, tools and equipment inventories. (T-0)
    3.8.3. Need for Training Devices. Maintain sufficient US and Foreign Ordnance Training
    Devices to meet upgrade training and performance standards. Training aids should be of
    sufficient quantity and quality to perform technical evaluations. Training aids should have
    the ability to be monitored to indicate success or failure of employment of EOD procedures.
    (T-2)
3.9. Training Responsibilities:
    3.9.1. AFCEC/CXD:
        3.9.1.1. Submits MAJCOM inputs to the EOD Standard Training Package.

     3.9.1.2. Oversees the development, updating, and publishing of the CFETP and Specialty
     Training Standard.
     3.9.1.3. Consolidates MAJCOM inputs to establish “Road-to-War” training packages in
     response to wartime/contingent needs.
     3.9.1.4. Oversees the EOD portion of Silver Flag curriculum, and other functional
     contingency training programs; ensures the EOD program is prepared to present forces in
     compliance with CCDR, Non-Standard Forces Training Requirements (NSFTR) and
     Standard Forces Training Requirements (SFTR), and 2nd AF requirements for entry into
     combat theaters.
     3.9.1.5. Represents the EOD program at the Training Equipment Review Board (TERB)
     with 2nd AF, Air Forces Central (AFCENT), and other relative representatives.
  3.9.2. MAJCOMs:
     3.9.2.1. Recommend subject and task material in writing to AFCEC/CXD.
     3.9.2.2. Set up procedures to schedule, complete, and document training requirements.
     3.9.2.3. Request and manage quotas for EOD formal training courses.
     3.9.2.4. Monitor personnel attendance to ensure maximum course use and prevent lapses
     in individual certifications.
     3.9.2.5. Supplement the CFETP to include MAJCOM-unique requirements.
  3.9.3. EOD Flights:
     3.9.3.1. EOD Officers initial qualification training includes Initial Job Qualification
     Standard (IJQS) for standby, equipment issue and familiarization, EOD flight operations,
     all Home Station Training (HST), all ancillary training, and selected reading as deemed
     necessary by the MAJCOM and local unit commanders. EOD officer technical
     competency is required to facilitate equal partnership in Joint/Coalition arenas and in the
     execution of their daily duties. In order to garner an equal footing, USAF EOD qualified
     officers should complete all local IJQS tasks.
     3.9.3.2. Ensure that recently graduated 3-level Airmen dedicate daily study-time to
     complete CDCs during duty hours, when possible.
     3.9.3.3. Flight management must evaluate members returning from extended
     deployments (e.g., 179-day and longer) to ensure member’s proficiency on core tasks
     listed in the CFETP and IJQS are still current. If recertification on certain tasks is
     required, follow documentation procedures listed in the CFETP. Annotate AF IMT 623a,
     On the Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, in the AFTR that this review was
     accomplished. (T-1)
     3.9.3.4. Base Populace Training. EOD Flights will provide training as requested on
     ordnance hazards and recognition, mine awareness, terrorist bomb search procedures, and
     personnel protective measures. This includes an annual briefing to local Fire Fighters on
     ordnance hazards and precautions for munitions supported as requested. (T-2)
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                    51


           3.9.3.4.1. AF EOR is taught via web-based training. EOD flights may provide other
           methods to supplement the AF EOR course; however, the web-based training is the
           mandatory basic course.
           3.9.3.4.2. Flights will use AFCEC/CXD standardized informational training/briefings
           as a template for briefings on EOD mission capability, ordnance hazards and
           recognition, IED awareness, mine awareness, terrorist bomb search procedures, and
           personnel protective measures. (T-2) These briefings are available on the AF EOD
           Program Management SharePoint® site https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-
           A6/21340/OO-EN-CE-49/SitePages/Home.aspx.
           3.9.3.4.3. If EOD flights are requested to provide EOD-related briefings away from
           home station to national agencies (e.g., Bureau of Land Management (BLM), DTRA,
           EPA, TSWG, DoD, etc.), other military services, HQ USAF or Secretary of the AF
           agencies/offices, the briefings should be coordinated with MAJCOM EOD staffs,
           AFCEC/CXD, and AF/A4CXR prior to being briefed/released.
           3.9.3.4.4. EOD flights will support community outreach programs to educate both
           installation personnel and the surrounding public on the dangers of trespassing on
           ranges and the hazards associated with UXO. (T-2)
       3.9.3.5. Flight Management should attend the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)
       EOD Flight Management Course (or a MAJCOM orientation liaison) at the earliest
       opportunity after assuming the position.
3.10. Road to War (RTW) Training. Contingency operations during Operations ENDURING
FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM significantly changed the way EOD employed to support
ground tactical environments and highlighted the importance of a robust and comprehensive
predeployment training continuum for EOD operators. MAJCOM flight training programs will
institute a RTW training philosophy (30-60 days) that focuses the Airman’s attention on
contingency tasks and necessary skills to operate in the stressful and arduous environments of
deployed operations. The EOD Training Program at the flight, MAJCOM and AF level must
continue to reinforce the skills necessary to deploy to any environment, at any time, and with the
expectation of supporting US or Coalition general or special forces requiring an EOD capability.
(T-3)
   3.10.1. General.
       3.10.1.1. Upon deployment notification the member’s priority is to train for the deployed
       location. It is imperative that an EOD flight’s SIPRNET be active, current, and
       functional since much of the information needed will be posted on the SIPR. As a
       minimum, the EOD member will: (T-3)
           3.10.1.1.1. Review EODIMS, JEODTSC, and intelligence web sites for information
           as it relates to specific Area of Operations (AO) threats.
           3.10.1.1.2. Request theater specific EOD Intel products from local Intel
           organizations. (AFI 14-119)
       3.10.1.2. EOD Airmen should not volunteer for other taskings within a 60 day window

       exempt Airmen from downward directed MAJCOM taskings for VIPPSA or RST
       missions.
       3.10.1.3. Miscellaneous TDYs that do not contribute to upgrade training or PME, should
       not be supported within the 60 day predeployment window (PME and 7-Skill Level
       Craftsman Course must be accomplished if scheduled). Observer/Controller (OC)
       support to Silver Flag is an acceptable tasking during RTW training.
   3.10.2. Training Continuum. MAJCOM training programs need to include, as a minimum,
   the following:
       3.10.2.1. Troop Leading Procedures (Small Squad Tactics/FM 3-2.8, The Infantry Rifle

          explosives are used.
          3.11.1.1.2. Document HDIP monthly qualifications in the AFTR or similar product.
      3.11.1.2. Waivers.
          3.11.1.2.1. During periods of deployments and at locations where monthly
          qualification for Demolition Pay is not possible due to political, fiscal, or contingency
          reasons, personnel may be temporarily waived from this requirement (see paragraph
          1.8.11.2). Ensure deployed SNCO, NCO or officers provide documentation for
          inclusion in training records. (T-2)
          3.11.1.2.2. EOD flights must validate, through the deployed/installation commander
          or MAJCOM staff that no type of explosives operations may be performed (including
          explosive-operated tools) for the purpose of qualification proficiency training.
          Personnel will maintain a copy of the validated waiver with their individual training
          records. (T-0)
      3.11.1.3. EOD Flight management will ensure the finance office is notified when a
      member fails to perform the monthly demolition duty required for entitlement to HDIP.
      (T-0) (Unless waived per paragraph 3.11.1.2. through 3.11.1.2.2.)
   3.11.2. Group II – Semiannual Training Requirements. Conduct classroom instruction
   and practical (hands-on) training for team members. During classroom training, tools are

   3.12.2. Home Station Emergency Response (Stand-by). Flights will develop and use the
   IJQS to train and document home-station specific qualifications required to perform EOD
   standby duties. IJQS will include committed aerospace platforms and munitions, safety
   programs, protective equipment, and installation response plans as a minimum. (T-1)
54                                                           AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


  3.12.3. Unit-Committed Munitions Listing (UCML). Flights will use the UCML to build
  training requirements. Members must be locally trained on UCML items and the training
  documented using IJQS before performing EOD standby duties or responding to an actual
  incident. (T-1)
     3.12.3.1. UCML can be obtained from the installation Munitions Accountable Supply
     Officer (MASO).
     3.12.3.2. In addition to the UCML, use the Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMST) and

     MAJCOMs, Air Force Forces (AFFOR) CCDR’s, and other services to determine these
     requirements. Contingency type training is fluid and requirements are difficult to
     forecast. However, the intent is to maintain skills consistently to reduce future JIT
     requirements.
  3.12.5. Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) and Occupational Safety
  and Health Administration (OSHA) Training Requirements. (AF IMT 55, Employee
  Safety and Health Record)
     3.12.5.1. Document all ancillary training on the AF IMT 55. Flights will use the AF
     EOD standard AF IMT 55 as a template available on the EOD Management
     SharePoint®. AFRC and ANG units will develop and maintain a pre-deployment
     training IJQS which will be employed upon activation or mobilization. (T-1)
  3.12.6. Nuclear Weapons Training.
     3.12.6.1. All flights train on core nuclear tasks per 3E8X1 CFETP. Training consists of
     at least the following:
        3.12.6.1.1. Conduct annual classroom training on all active DoD systems (As a
        minimum using TO 60N-60-1and 60N-60-6).
        3.12.6.1.2. One annual Broken Arrow exercise. The exercise should be practical, but
        may be ‘table-top’ when necessary.
     3.12.6.2. At AF EOD flights that provide direct nuclear support, personnel are trained to
     perform all necessary EOD actions from weapon stabilization to weapon recovery. Upon
     arrival at a direct support base, newly assigned personnel should strive to be fully
     certified on the assigned weapon systems within 180 days. In remote locations that are a
     short tour length, it is imperative for flight manning level requirements to be maintained
     with fully certified members. (T-0)
        3.12.6.2.1. EOD personnel train on EOD nuclear procedures including, as a
        minimum, RSP, continuation procedures, and component recovery tasks (Identify and
        recover without violating warnings or safety precautions relating to all hazards).
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                  55


         3.12.6.2.2. EOD custodial unit training on systems consists of semi-annual classroom
         and annual practical training. Training on DoD systems not directly supported is per
         paragraph 3.12.6.1.1 above. One annual Broken Arrow exercise will involve at least
         one custodial unit weapon system. (T-1)
      3.12.6.3. Type 3A/C trainers used exclusively for EOD training will be maintained in a
      war reserve (WR) configuration but may deviate from WR standards with Unsatisfactory
      Report (UR) approval. For those trainers not on the weapons maintenance account, the
      MUNS/MOO and owning agency (EOD flight) will work out a periodic inspection and
      maintenance schedule to repair deficiencies in order to keep the trainers in WR
      configuration, IAW AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures. (T-1)
      3.12.6.4. AF EOD Nuclear Training Path:              Course requirements and reporting

          4.2.1.1.1. Flights will maintain an accurate status of all logistical requirements via
          ACES-RM. ACES-RM is the authoritative program of record for accountability of
          EOD equipment. ACES-RM provides capability to track and monitor Test,
          Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) and items for continuous
          recalibration and replacement. (T-1)
          4.2.1.1.2. For items that cannot be ordered due to a legitimate constraint (funding,
          procurement issues, etc.), every effort expended to resolve the issue will be
          documented and tracked through to completion IAW with MAJCOM or local
          procedures. (T-2)
          4.2.1.1.3. For common readily available shelf life items that have short expiration
          dates, flights may forgo procurement until a deployment tasking is received. Flights
          must ensure resources have funds, and locations are pre-identified where to purchase
          items in the local market to ensure item fills meet DOC timelines. (T-2)
      4.2.1.2. Maintenance. All ESL required equipment will be serviceable. If an item is
      unserviceable, every effort to resolve the issue will be documented and tracked through to
      completion IAW MAJCOM or local procedures. (T-1)

       4.2.1.5. Unit Supply Accounts. EOD flights must maintain equipment, munitions,
       supply, and weapons accounts IAW AF guidance and local directives. (T-1)
   4.2.2. Reporting Equipment Status. Flights must accurately report UTC/ESL equipment
   status using the Automated Civil Engineer Resource Module (ACES-RM). ACES-RM is the
   authoritative database for use in equipment accountability and for AFCEC use during
   strategic sourcing.
       4.2.2.1. SORTS/ART: Flights will report respective equipment status utilizing both the
       SORTS Report and the AEF Reporting Tool IAW paragraph 3.7.3 and 3.7.4. (T-1)
           4.2.2.2.1. Use. The ACES-RM will provide HAF, AFCEC/CXD, and MAJCOMs
           the capability to assess current capabilities, assist with AF audits, POM Build and
           Munitions Buy Budget process and conduct Program and Command Purchase of
           EOD equipment.
   4.2.3. UTC/ESL Updates. To ensure standardization of EOD equipment and supplies,
   recommended changes to any part of the ESL must be reviewed and refined by the EOD
   EWG and approved by EODP for presentation to the EESPG. All ESL changes (those that
   modify the capability of a UTC) shall be approved by the EESPG to include out-of-cycle if
   necessary. The EODP can request the EWG to readdress an ESL issue. Recommended ESL
   changes will be accomplished via an ESL Change Sheet and routed through the MAJCOM to
   AFCEC/CXD for discussion at the next EWG.
4.3. Contingency and Emergency Response Vehicle Maintenance Priorities. EOD teams are
designated as emergency responders and are an integral part of the installations “sortie
sustainment”. Per AFI 24-302, Vehicle Maintenance, EOD vehicles are designated as Priority II
Sortie Sustaining Vehicles and should receive a Priority II maintenance and repair priority. EOD
flights will coordinate with the installations Vehicle Maintenance Squadron to ensure that their
vehicles reflect the priority II rating in the installations Mission Essential Levels (MELS)
Listing. (T-1)

                      STRATEGIC PLANS AND REQUIREMENTS

5.1. AF Deliberate Planning.
   5.1.1. USAF War Mobilization Plan (WMP). The WMP is discussed in AFMAN 10-401,
   Operational Plan and Concept Plan Development and Implementation. The WMP is the
   principle AF document that feeds the joint-service planning system – specifically, the Joint
   Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The WMP is a five-volume AF document that provides
   Air Staff and USAF commanders with current policies, forces, and planning factors for
   conducting and supporting wartime operations. Volume 1 (WMP-1) is important for flights:
   WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 outlines EOD wartime posturing, capability, and deliberate
   planning for worst-case scenarios. Flight managers should be familiar with EOD capabilities
   and the deliberate planning factors. Flights comply with paragraph 1.2.8 and 3.7.4 of this
   instruction to ensure correct UTC data is available for loading in the Time-Phased Force and
   Deployment Data (TPFDD) libraries.
   5.1.2. DOC-Taskings. DOC-Taskings outline which OPLAN flights are attached to, and
   the UTCs they are required to posture in addition to SORTS and ART reporting
   requirements.
5.2. Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans.
   5.2.1. Review Plans. Review Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans annually.
   These plans are normally available through Wing Plans (XP) office.
   5.2.2. Base Support Plans (BSP). Every base has a BSP. Ensure EOD requirements are
   listed in the plan. The BSP explains the Ready Augmentee Program requirements, vehicle
   needs, and other parameters of support.
   5.2.3. Emergency Management (EM) Planning. EM planning is covered in AFI 10-2501.
   EOD flights use EM planning in addition to the EOD mission CONOPS/AFTTPs to assist in
   developing Team Leader guides for emergency response.
5.3. Plan Sourcing Procedures.
   5.3.1. UTC Availability. EOD Flight Chief in conjunction with the Unit Deployment
   Manager (UDM) will update ART and SORTS IAW local procedures and applicable
   directives. (T-1)
   5.3.2. Deployed TOs. Deployed teams must coordinate with the theater EOD functional
   regarding the number of TO sets dispatched so TO distribution can be identified at the
   deployed base. (T-1) Gaining MAJCOMs will coordinate with AFCEC/CXE and
   AFCEC/CXD so that the deployed team can receive a new TODO account. AFCEC/CXD
   will establish a new flight within EODIMS.
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                               65

                               SIGNAL AND COMMUNICATIONS

6.1. Home station Land Mobile Radios (LMR) requirements. In addition to a dedicated
EOD net, EOD flights will have access to a minimum of the following radio nets: airfield control
tower, fire/crash, CE, Security Forces, and supported ranges. (T-1) (As applicable.)
6.2. Tactical communications. These requirements are listed in the EOD ESL.
6.3. Communication Security (COMSEC). EOD flights must have COMSEC accounts for
management of secure communications and navigational aids. (T-0)
6.4. Satellite Communications. Prior to acquisition, coordinate satellite communications
terminal purchases with MAJCOM EOD functional management, AFCEC/CXD, and the local
communications squadron to ensure equipment interoperability, frequency approval, downlink
support and satellite service access/availability.
6.5. Frequency Management. Flights and MAJCOMs must obtain radio frequency assignment
for EOD electronic tools (e.g., robots, remote firing devices, x-ray devices, etc.) from base level
spectrum manager or the Air Force Frequency Management Agency (AFFMA). (DoDI 4650.1,
Policy and Procedures for Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, and AFI 33-
580, Spectrum Management.)
     6.5.1. Coordination. Even if EOD electronic tools have prior joint-service or AF spectrum
     certification, flights shall coordinate local equipment spectrum certification prior to
     equipment being placed in operation using DD Form 1494, Application for Equipment
     Frequency Allocation.11 Be sure to plan for foreign frequency authorizations for potential
     forward deployed locations. (T-0)
     6.5.2. Use of Electronic Attack Equipment. Use of electronic attack equipment (e.g.,
     Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW))
     requires frequency assignment for training, testing, and exercises. Chairman Joint Chiefs of
     Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3212.02C, Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and
     Canada for Tests, Training, and Exercises and DoDD 5101.14, DoD Executive Agent and
     Single Manager for Military Ground-Based Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive
     Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) Technology is the official guidance for frequency
     clearance procedures for performing electronic attack.
        6.5.2.1. Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Policy on Activation: The EOD program
        has fielded several dismounted ECM platforms (examples include: AN/PLT 3, 4, and 5)
        for operations to counter the radio controlled IED (RCIED) threat. Within CONUS the
        FBI is the lead federal agency for all domestic RCIED ECM operations, to include
        Alaska and Hawaii. When AF EOD teams have determined an RCIED threat exists, and
        no other means of mitigation are possible to ensure the safety of their operations, AF
        EOD flights must follow the ECM Notification Card procedures and the RCIED
        CONOPS. (T-0)

  NOTE: The requirement and application instructions for spectrum supportability of CREW devices are in the
Joint IED Defeat Office (JIEDDO) Director’s Policy Letter #10, Submission of DD Form 1494, Application for
Equipment Frequency Allocation, 16 Oct 06, available through the installation spectrum manager from AFFMA/XP.

     6.5.2.2. Implementing the ECM Notification Card procedures and approval from FBI
     will cause Federal Aviation Administration to establish a Temporary Flight Restriction
     (TFR). Because most EOD flights are located near active airfields or airports a TFR will
     cause flight diversions, restrictions, cancelations and have potential for significant
     impacts on commerce. For this reason it’s essential for flights to only request ECM
     activation when needed based on personnel’s assessment of an RCIED threat at the scene.
     Personnel will immediately deactivate when no longer needed and follow up with
     notifications for termination.

                        INSTALLATIONS AND MISSION SUPPORT

Section 7A—Facilities

7.1. EOD Facilities Requirements. EOD Facility guidelines are provided in AFMAN 32-1084,
Facility Requirements, paragraph 2.4.2. Use the below design recommendations in conjunction
with AFMAN 32-1084.
   7.1.1. Functional Requirements.
      7.1.1.1. EOD facilities require an operations control center containing state of the art
      communications and visual aids to include base, local and state maps covering the flight’s
      AOR.
      7.1.1.2. The EOD training room is used to conduct in-house and outside agency training
      and must be certified for classified briefings, at the Secret level.
      7.1.1.3. The facility will have an industrial work area suitable to conduct general
      maintenance on assigned equipment and robotic platforms. Due to the storage of
      hazardous materials and high noise levels, this area should be physically separated from
      other administrative and inhabited areas. (T-2)
      7.1.1.4. Climate controlled equipment storage bay capable of providing secure storage of
      first responder equipment, mobility packages, base support, and personal protective
      equipment. Facilities will have enclosed storage for Base Support Emergency Response
      Vehicle (BSERV) and All-purpose Remote Transport System (ARTS) robotic platforms,
      if applicable. Climate control is required to prolong the shelf life of material and
      equipment sensitive to temperature extremes. (T-2)
      7.1.1.5. Facilities will have latrines for both male and female personnel with showers;
      secure storage for firearms and classified material/SIPRNET; printer for classified,
      washer and dryer; and a kitchenette suitable to sustain 24-hour operations. (T-2)
      7.1.1.6. EOD facilities will be sited at “inhabited building” distance from any explosives
      site IAW AFMAN 91-201. All inhabited and industrial work areas must be
      environmentally controlled. (T-2)
   7.1.2. Spatial Requirements. Spatial requirements are based on AFMS and the Capabilities
   Based Manpower Determinants (CBMD), amount of assigned base support and DOC tasked
   equipment and vehicles per AFMAN 32-1084.
   7.1.3. Criteria, Applicability and Justification. EOD personnel provide a 24-hr, including
   normal duty hours on base presence, and off-duty hours phone standby explosive hazard
   response capability to aircraft recovery operations, explosives-related incidents, and weapons
   of mass destruction or other terrorist-related events. EOD personnel conduct extensive in-
   house proficiency training and provide base-populace training on EOR, IED, canine, and
   vehicle search procedures, certification on use of pyrotechnics, explosives safety, and aircraft
   explosive hazard familiarization.
 68                                                              AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


   7.1.4. Special Features. The EOD facility must meet requirements for storage of hazardous
   and explosive materials, classified information, and firearms according to DoD 6055.9-M
   (Volume 1 through 8), DoD Explosives Safety Standards, AFMAN 91-201 and other federal,
   state, and local laws. (T-0)
       7.1.4.1. EOD facilities will maintain a SIPRNET/Secure Telephone Equipment (STE) or
       Secure Voice Over Internet (SVOIP), Secondary Crash Net, Fax, DSN/Commercial/Fax
       lines, and LMR (base stations). (T-1)
       7.1.4.2. Mobility and other flight general-purpose vehicles should be stored in a secure
       fenced in, covered, and lighted area. Equipment load out areas will also have sufficient
       lighting for safe load out of equipment. (T-2)
       7.1.4.3. The EOD Proficiency Training Range is required under category code 831-173.
       Explosives will be stored IAW DoD 6055.9-M, (Volume 1-8), and AFMAN 91-201. (T-
       0)

Section 7B—Federal and Civil Support

7.2. Installation Support to Off-Base EOD Response. As outlined in DoDD 2000.13, Civil
Affairs, this section provides EOD guidance to meet the life sustaining needs of the civilian
population and provide expertise to restore civilian sector functions. Installation Commanders
will evaluate and then commit as appropriate, available resources in response to requests from
civil authorities under circumstances requiring immediate response (AFI 10-801). (T-0)
   7.2.1. Support Staff.      The installation commander or designee, a Public Affairs
   representative, and a Judge Advocate representative should accompany the EOD team to the
   location of the incident. However, emergency responses to potentially life-threatening
   emergencies will not be delayed awaiting legal reviews or unified media responses. (T-1)
       7.2.1.1. The commander may designate the senior EOD team member as his
       representative pending determination of the need for additional support.
       7.2.1.2. The Public Affairs and Judge Advocate representatives may be in “on-call”
       status pending determination of the need for additional support. (T-2)
   7.2.2. Risk Category. An incident risk category is assigned per AFJI-32-3002.
   Commanders must limit exposure of EOD personnel to risk of injury or loss of life unless the
   critical nature of the threat to the civilian population clearly justifies the risk. Base the risk
   decision on a joint assessment of the incident by the senior EOD representative and the
   incident commander.
   7.2.3. Response Parameters. See details for responding to military ordnance and to non-
   military devices/explosives in paragraph 3.1.4.
   7.2.4. Munitions Inerting. EOD is authorized to inert munitions only if required to support
   an official mission objective when AFMC or the System Program Office (SPO) cannot
   provide the support. The MAJCOM EOD staff must first approve any request for an inerting
   operation. EOD units will use the guidance for locally written procedures in AFMAN 91-
   201. The procedures to be used by AF EOD units must be, as a minimum, coordinated with
   Wing Safety and approved by the squadron commander. Forward locally approved
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                      69


   procedures to the MAJCOM EOD staff, which in turn will obtain MAJCOM/SEW
   concurrence/approval prior to beginning inerting operations.
7.3. EOD Assistance to Civil Authorities.
   7.3.1. Directive Authority. This section provides guidance for emergency EOD response to
   hazardous explosives, or explosive devices, that threaten the civil populace, authorizing
   installation commanders, on request from civil authorities, to provide EOD assistance per the
   following conditions:
      7.3.1.1. All off-installation EOD emergency responses in support of civil authorities are
      initially treated as “immediate response authority” requests under DoDD 3025.18 and
      DoDI 3025.21 until an on-site EOD assessment of the situation determines otherwise.
      7.3.1.2. As soon as practical, the particulars of the support to civil authorities (see
      paragraph 3.1.4.) will be provided, through command post channels, to the National
      Military Command Center (NMCC) and National Joint Operations and Intelligence
      Center (NJOIC).
      7.3.1.3. All DSCA response activities will be conducted IAW AFPD 10-8 and AFI 10-
      801.
   7.3.2. Reimbursement of Civil EOD Support. Flights will coordinate with their
   installation legal office and financial management/comptroller to build a list of expenses that
   are eligible for reimbursement and clarify when reimbursement for EOD support should be
   billed to civil authorities (e.g., loss of military specialized equipment, travel/per-diem costs,
   and/or military man-hours). Reimbursement applies only for response actions to non-
   military munitions. Emergency EOD support will not be withheld due to lack of
   reimbursement. (T-3) Flights will also:
      7.3.2.1. Maintain logs of expenses incurred and resources expended when providing
      support to civil authorities. (T-2)
      7.3.2.2. Report all DSCA support to local Command Post and Comptroller. (T-3)
      7.3.2.3. Work with local Comptroller to develop procedures to seek reimbursement for
      EOD support provided to local and federal civil authorities. (T-3)
 70                                                                          AFI32-3001 20 November 2014

                           PROGRAMS AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

8.1. CE Financial Planning and Budgeting.
       8.1.1. Program Planning: AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded
       Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects, implements the planning, programming,
       and executing of operations and maintenance (O&M) funded projects for funded facilities
       operational requirements.
       8.1.2. Budget Forecasting. Flights will use available financial management tools to
       forecast budgets. Flights should use a three-year historical basis to average and track
       expenditures.12 (T-1)
8.2. Cost Center Management (Budgets). Flight managers must prepare flight budgets, ensure
requirements are incorporated into the parent flight budget, monitor funds expenditure
throughout the year, and request additional funds when needed. Close coordination with
squadron Resources Managers and owning MAJCOM EOD staff is critical to an effective
Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. Flight management must
prepare flight budgets and submit to the resource advisor. The flight budget must develop a
quarterly spend plan and ensure Office of the Secretary of Defense expenditure targets are met
throughout the year. The annual flight budget request must be posted in MICT that details
request by EEIC. (T-1)

                                         Chapter 9

               ASSESSMENTS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND EXERCISES

9.1. Lessons Learned (L2) Tracking. All levels of command may report lessons learned.
After Action Reports (AAR) are normally completed at deployed location or within 30 days after
the completion of an operation. See Attachment 5, EOD After Action Report Process, for details
concerning the AAR program.
   9.1.1. Submitting L2. A person or flight having L2 provides the issues in writing to the
   contingency theater headquarters staff and to the parent MAJCOM EOD Staff for review and
   consolidation, ensuring there is no redundancy in the Joint Universal Lessons Learned
   System (JULLS). MAJCOMs forward L2 to AFCEC/CXD for presentation to the EODP, or
   out-of-cycle EODP review if necessary. Units submitting AARs and L2 should use AF IMT
   Form 4329, 4329A or 4330 or 4330A respectively for both NIPR and SIPR submissions until
   EODIMS AAR/L2 module is fully incorporated into a future release. (T-1)
   9.1.2. EODP Actions. The EODP will discuss and determine if the L2 warrant the
   expenditure of resources. If the EODP accepts/approves the L2, they are linked to EODP
   Action Items for tracking and resolution.
   9.1.3. AFCEC/CXD Actions. AFCEC/CXD will use a database to track L2 until the
   EODIMS L2 Module is complete. Manage the EODIMS L2 IAW the EODIMS CONOPS
   and EODIMS User’s Manual.
9.2. EODP Action Item Process.
   9.2.1. Submitting Action Items.
       9.2.1.1. Any EOD personnel, flight, or agency having a proposal to bring before EODP
       must have MAJCOM EOD staff review and sponsor the proposal. (T-1)
       9.2.1.2. The EODP is the first level for issues and recommendations affecting the AF
       EOD career field. A proposal brought before the EODP must be accomplished in
       compliance with the EODP Charter. (T-1)
   9.2.2. Processing Action Items.
       9.2.2.1. The EODP will discuss and determine if the proposal warrants the expenditure
       of resources. The EODP will then vote on the proposal and take appropriate action as
       determined by the vote (e.g., create an action item).
       9.2.2.2. Each EODP action item is assigned an OPR, and actions toward completion are
       tracked in a AFCEC/CXD database. The data base is updated and managed throughout
       the year and scrubbed semi-annually during EODP meetings. Action Items are
       incorporated into the AF EOD Business Plan when appropriate.
       9.2.2.3. Action items involving CE policy or funding issues may require review and
       approval by the EESPG or the Civil Engineer Council (CEC).
9.3. Exercise Support and Planning.
   9.3.1. Home-Station Support. EOD flights should provide a qualified military EOD person
   to the installation wing inspection team.
 72                                                                     AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


     9.3.2. EOD Support to Deployed Exercises. All fighter/bomber deployments (exercise or
     real-world) incorporating any live munitions must have on-site EOD capability. On-site
     USAF EOD support is necessary to provide safe and timely support for aircraft and
     munitions operations.13 (T-1)
9.4. Quality Assurance (QA). All EOD flights will have a QA program. Smaller EOD flights
may choose to adopt the parent squadron/wing program but flights are encouraged to have a
program within the EOD flight with a dedicated QA person/section. Quality Assurance
evaluations will be performed by qualified military EOD personnel. (T-1)
     9.4.1. Flight Management Responsibilities.               Flight Management is responsible for
     oversight of the EOD program and will:
        9.4.1.1. Establish a flight QA program consisting of team evaluations and functional area
        inspections. (T-1)
        9.4.1.2. Designate a NCO as the flight QA focal point responsible for administration of
        the QA program. (T-1)
        9.4.1.3. Develop a method to track, monitor and close identified findings or
        discrepancies. (T-1)
        9.4.1.4. The Self-Assessment Checklist (SAC) is the official checklist used by
        MAJCOM Inspector General offices to focus on compliance and operational readiness
        through the Management Inspection (MI), Unit Effectiveness Inspection (UEI), and the
        Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP) under AFI 90-201 and is located on the
        Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) within the AF Inspection Agency website

   NOTE: EOD from other US service components may be employed after a commander’s multi-functional ORM
assessment and approval. In such cases, commanders should obtain, in advance, a documented MOA for dedicated
support to the AF exercise
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                  73


         9.4.2.6. Nuclear       Weapon  Response–Broken     Arrow    (Non-Custodial:
         Annual/Custodial: Semi-Annual) Non-custodial units may conduct the response
         exercise via table top.
         9.4.2.7. Chemical/ Biological Weapon (Contingency – including disposal).
         9.4.2.8. Demolition Operation.
   9.4.3. QA Division or Designated Individual.       The following guidance will be used to
   establish the QA program operations. (T-3)
      9.4.3.1. Design practical scenarios to assess how a team applies collective knowledge,
      experience, and efforts to arrive at decisions and pursue logical courses of action.
      Scenarios will be logical and of a type likely to be encountered in actual operations. All
      flight personnel will participate in some capacity in tactical and emergency response
      evaluations. Simulations should be kept to a minimum to enhance realism and quality of
      training. (T-1)
         9.4.3.1.1. Training operations will not be counted as a practical QA evaluation. QA
         evaluations will be conducted by a certified EOD 7-Skill level.
         9.4.3.1.2. An emergency EOD response may be counted as a QA evaluation if the
         team performed satisfactorily and the outcome of the operation was conducted in a
         safe and efficient manner. For example, a munition’s incident/accident where an
         actual RSP was performed; an IED operation that led to the RSP or safe disposal; an
         aircraft incident or crash where EOD actions were sufficient enough to demonstrate a
         practical knowledge and understanding of the weapon system. Document response
         using AF Form 2419, Routing and Review of Quality Control Reports, or other
         method approved by flight management.
      9.4.3.2. Team evaluations will be evaluated and rated by individuals trained and certified
      in the type of operation evaluated. (T-1) Evaluation ratings are as follows:
         9.4.3.2.1. Pass - Successful accomplishment with no equipment, technical data, or
         personnel deficiencies that precluded completion of the operation.
         9.4.3.2.2. Fail - Any of the following constitute a failed rating:
             9.4.3.2.2.1. The team commits a major safety error.
             9.4.3.2.2.2. The team demonstrates a lack of professional competence to such a
             degree that the specific operation being evaluated could not be completed.
      9.4.3.3. Re-evaluate individuals that receive a failed rating after necessary remedial
      training has been accomplished, preferably within 30 days for RegAF and 90 days for
      ARC.
      9.4.3.4. Functional Area reviews. Conduct the following functional area reviews at least
      once per calendar year. Self-reviews by personnel assigned to that particular functional
      area will not be used to fulfill this requirement. (T-1)
         9.4.3.4.1. Nuclear Surety (Custodial units only).
         9.4.3.4.2. Vehicles.

explosives or munitions emergency response may include in-place render-safe procedures,
treatment or destruction of the explosives or munitions, and/or transporting those items to
another location to be rendered safe, treated, or destroyed. Any reasonable delay in the
completion of an explosives or munitions emergency response caused by a necessary,
unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstance will not terminate the explosives or munitions
emergency. Explosives and munitions emergency responses can occur on either public or private
lands.
Improvised Explosive Device (IED)—A weapon that is fabricated or emplaced in an
unconventional manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary
chemicals designed to kill, destroy, incapacitate, harass, deny mobility, or distract. Also called

 EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD) SIGNIFICANT-INCIDENT ANALYSIS
                         REPORT (SAR)

Note: Safety Investigation Board (SIB), Ground Accident Investigation Board (GAIB), and
OSI investigations take priority over the SAR. If at anytime while conducting a SAR the
team comes across evidence of potential crimes the team must stop immediately and turn
the investigation over to the proper authorities. No confidentiality privileges apply during
conduct of the SAR.
A3.1. General. This provides policy guidance for Air Force (AF) EOD duty-related accidents
or incidents, including hostile actions, that result in loss of an EOD Operator’s life or traumatic
injury resulting in the loss of a limb, eye sight, or other permanent incapacitating injuries to an
EOD Operator.
   A3.1.1. Purpose of the SAR is to provide swift and accurate feedback so that forward-
   deployed and CONUS EOD managers can mitigate and prevent successive incidents and as a
   means to improve lessons learned. The SAR will provide timely insight to the tactics,
   techniques, and procedures (TTP) surrounding a significant incident without having to wait
   for other agency reports (e.g., especially when it involves other service agencies). The SAR
   will provide the functional community the ability to analyze our TTP and take expeditious
   corrective actions.
   A3.1.2. Per the promulgation information in the front of each Joint Service EOD 60-series
   Technical Order (TO), TTP involving EOD operations are at minimum controlled
   unclassified information (CUI) and will contain the appropriate classification marking when
   required. SARs should not be released outside the AF EOD functional community and
   related chain of command and will not be released to the public except as required by law.
   The SAR Directing Authority (paragraph A4.2.2.) may authorize distribution to joint service
   EOD units and their chains of command as necessary.
   A3.1.3. Waivers. Waiver approval authority is AFCEC/CC. The Directing Authority may
   request waivers to SAR reporting through the chain of command having administrative
   control (ADCON) and operational control (OPCON) authority.
A3.2. Responsibilities.
   A3.2.1. AF/A4C. AF EOD mishaps as a result of joint operations under a forward
   Geographic Combatant Commaders (GCC) authority, may require Air Staff CE involvement.
       A3.2.1.1. In the event an incident investigation was not directed in a GCC’s AO,
       AF/A4C may request the AF component to the CCDR direct a SAR of any serious
       incident involving AF EOD personnel.
       A3.2.1.2. If an incident investigation is directed by the CCDR, the AF component to the
       CCDR should ensure that an AF EOD-qualified representative be part of the team
       conducting the investigation and preparing the report. Otherwise, refer to A4.2.1.1.
       A3.2.1.3. AF/A4CXR should engage with its functional counterparts at AF component
       commands to use established AF direct liaison authority to develop a procedure or
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                     91


      agreement with joint service units in their AOR to expedite AF access to other service’s
      reports of investigation.
   A3.2.2. Directing Authority. Unit commanders at all levels of command have the inherent
   command authority to direct an investigation of any mishap affecting the personnel or
   missions under their command. Directing Authority for the SAR is normally the AF unit
   commander exercising ADCON/OPCON authority. The Directing Authority will:
      A3.2.2.1. Determine the scope and size of the SAR team, and designate one or more
      EOD personnel to research, analyze, and finalize all facets of the SAR.
          A3.2.2.1.1. The team lead must be EOD-qualified and a minimum grade of E7. (T-1)
          (E8 if applicable per paragraph A4.4.2.)
          A3.2.2.1.2. SAR team member(s) should not be assigned or attached to the unit the
          SAR is conducted on.
          A3.2.2.1.3. When SARs are conducted for incidents in deployed locations, at least
          one SAR team member should have EOD experience in the theater where the SAR is
          being conducted.
      A3.2.2.2. Ensure SARs cover all relevant factors.
      A3.2.2.3. Provide AF/A4CXR, AFCEC/CXD, and AF component EOD functional (if
      applicable) with updates and the final SAR as outlined in paragraph A4.4.
   A3.2.3. SAR Team Leader.
      A3.2.3.1. Conduct the SAR per paragraph A4.4. below with the emphasis of determining
      the necessary actions to fix a deficiency, not determining fault or blame.
      A3.2.3.2. Brief the SAR to the unit leadership and Directing Authority prior to release of
      data.
      A3.2.3.3. Brief the EOD Panel on final reports.
A3.3. Information Control.
   A3.3.1. Classified information, information from Joint Service 60-series TOs (normally
   limited to EOD Personnel only) or other CUI should be included via publication and
   paragraph references.
   A3.3.2. If they are not classified, SARs are at a minimum For Official Use Only (FOUO).
   However, not every document in the report must be FOUO.
A3.4. Completing a SAR.
   A3.4.1. The Team Leader submits SARs to the Directing Authority in three stages: Initial
   (ISAR), Preliminary (PSAR), and Final (SAR).
      A3.4.1.1. ISAR. Within 48 hours of the incident the owning EOD Flight leadership will
      submit an ISAR containing the following information as a minimum: 1) a clear narrative
      of the incident with all known details surrounding the incident; 2) a description of injuries
      or illness to personnel involved; and 3) any other information related to the incident that
      requires rapid dissemination to potentially prevent injury to other personnel (i.e. new
      enemy TTP). (T-1)
 92                                                                     AFI32-3001 20 November 2014


        A3.4.1.2. Preliminary Significant Incident Analysis Report (PSAR). The SAR team will
        submit a PSAR within 5 duty days. Include any updates to the information contained in
        the Initial Significant Incident Analysis Report (ISAR). If the SAR team has not had time
        to conduct a preliminary analysis, the EOD Flight leadership can submit the PSAR. In
        most cases, the Level 1 EOD report (Storyboard) entered into EODIMS can be used to
        satisfy this requirement.
            A3.4.1.2.1. Significant Incident Working Group (SIG). Within 48 hours of receipt,
            AFCEC/CXD will send the PSAR or EOD Storyboard to a working group comprised
            of members from HAF, AFCEC, AFCENT, ACC, CoBRA and a representative from
            the affected MAJCOM. Others may be invited as applicable (i.e. AFCEC/CXE, Det
            3, AFRL, etc.). If at least two of the SIG members have not recently deployed (12
            months), then two additional EOD personnel with recent deployment experience will
            be added to the SIG. This group will convene (either in person or via telecom/VTC),
            review the PSAR or Storyboard and develop areas of interest based on feedback from
            MAJCOM and EOD Senior Leadership. These questions or interest areas will be sent
            back to the SAR team within 7 days of receipt of the body convening for
            incorporation into the investigation and final report.
        A3.4.1.3. Complete the SAR within 20 duty-days of the incident. SAR can be in bullet
        or narrative format but must include the nine areas listed in paragraph A4.4.3. Place a
        greater priority on complete and accurate reports than on finishing in the 20 day timeline.
        Notify Directing Authority and AFCEC/CXD if the SAR timelines cannot be completed.
        Do not submit SARs for external staffing: SARs are internal EOD reporting tools used to
        correct operational TTPs.
        A3.4.1.4. If at any time during the analysis the SAR team recognizes a grave disregard
        for safety or operational procedures with no clear explanation, take immediate action to
        prevent further injury or loss of life. Report this to the commander.
     A3.4.2. AF Participation in Non-AF Investigations. In combat situations, if the joint HQ
     uses another report format (e.g., Army Regulation 15-6), the AF will provide a member to
     the joint team if the incident involves an AF member. AF member will provide final copies
     of the joint report per A4.2.1.5. The member must be an EOD-qualified E8 or higher rank.16
     A3.4.3. Final SAR Contents. All SARs will include following information:
        A3.4.3.1. A clear narrative of the incident with all known details surrounding the
        incident. Identify and document hazards that played a role in the incident sequence.
        A3.4.3.2. First-hand witness accounts.
        A3.4.3.3. Other formal reports (e.g., safety message reports concerning the incident).
        A3.4.3.4. Injury and illness facts.
        A3.4.3.5. Summary List of pertinent facts.
        A3.4.3.6. Analysis of the facts and conclusions.17

16
  NOTE: This instruction does not mandate AF participation if the incident did not involve an AF member.
17
  NOTE: SARs may include a clearly annotated “Statement of Opinion” on the causal factor when data cannot
provide determination.
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                    93


       A3.4.3.7. Incident cause and recommended preventative measures. Specifically note all
       causal factors relating to equipment and/or training.
       A3.4.3.8. Include the following paragraph: “The intent of this document is to provide
       insight into the incident, so that EOD techs benefit from the lessons learned and heighten
       their awareness to both EOD standard operating procedures (SOPs) and TTPs as well as
       continually, changing enemy TTPs [if applicable]. This document includes questions
       raised during, as well as a result of, the post-incident analysis process. These questions
       are to be used as a case study learning tool.”
       A3.4.3.9. Other findings and recommendations of significance, which do not relate
       directly to the causes of the incident, but can be of value in risk management and incident
       prevention.
   A3.4.4. Upon completion of the SAR or AR 15-6, the SIG will review the SAR or AR 15-6
   and provide final recommendations in a lessons-learned narrative to AFCEC/CXD.
       A3.4.4.1. AFCEC/CXD will send a final lessons learned SIG report to AF/A4CX for
       staffing to AF/A4C for approval and posting on a single, AFCEC-designated Casualty
       Lessons Learned SharePoint® site for use by all EOD flights during annual training.
       This folder will include all applicable documents to include initial SPOTREP, EOD
       Storyboards and final Lessons Learned Report. Due to the sensitive nature of AR 15-6
       documents, they will not be posted but will be available to Senior Leadership.
A3.5. SAR Distribution: The final SAR should be an “internal EOD work-product” until
AFCEC/CXD develops sanitized report for EOD flight distribution. This sanitized report should
focus on TTPs, lessons learned, training deficiencies to correct, etc.
A3.6. SAR Disposition. AFCEC/CXD is the EOD office of record and will maintain an
electronic copy of the SAR as permanent.

                    EOD AFTER ACTION REPORT (AAR) PROCESS

A5.1. Use the following guidance to process EOD AARs to ensure standard, valid routing and
effective feedback for lessons learned and trend analysis.
   A5.1.1. In the context of this attachment, AARs are limited to those reports resulting from
   deployments in contingency operations. AARs must focus on what was done right or wrong
   with regards to Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education,
   Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) issues. AARs are not meant to be sounding boards for
   personality conflicts, generalizations, or perceptions; rather, it is for capturing observations
   that are measurable, observable, and sustainable. The opening of the AAR should discuss
   what the unit or IA did during the tour, and who they supported and what was accomplished.
A5.2. CCDR AARs will be managed by respective Air Component EOD or Engineer staff.
   A5.2.1. To preserve integrity and transparency of the feedback process, the original AAR
   from the deployed leadership will be loaded onto the “EOD AFCENT Program Management
   SharePoint®” https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/22760/default.aspx in “After Action Reports
   (AAR)” exactly as written.
   A5.2.2. There are two subfolders under “After Action Reports (AAR);” “Original AARs”
   and “With Comments,” the distinctions are self-explanatory.
A5.3. AARs are mandatory for every flight and highly encouraged for all others when deploying
from home station. All EOD techs that have lessons learned or ideas on how to improve
operations at EOD deployed locations should submit an AAR.
A5.4. Air Component Engineer and EOD staffs will reinforce with Flight leaders the value and
importance of communicating their issues up the chain; and, will require feedback early in the
deployment, midway, and at the end. EOD flight leaders need to understand that their comments
will be available to a much wider audience, and they need to use their communications skills
effectively.
A5.5. Submission Process:
   A5.5.1. 30-days prior to Replacements In Place (RIP)/Transfer Of Authority (TOA), Air
   Component Engineer and EOD staffs will suspense the flights to send their AARs.
   A5.5.2. When AARs are written after-the-fact at home station, the AAR must be routed back
   to the respective Air Component Engineer and EOD staff.
   A5.5.3. The process will be transparent: it must remain unclassified to the highest extent
   possible. Classified AARs will be handled in the same manner via the SIPR net.
A5.6. Review Process:
   A5.6.1. When the Air Component Engineer and EOD staff receives an AAR, they will
   provide (within 15 work days) the original AAR and one with initial comments to the
   AFCEC/CXD EOD Trends Analyst.
   A5.6.2. Prior to sending the comments forward, the member’s observations will be
   scrutinized to determine if they are measurable, achievable, and sustainable. Therefore, some
AFI32-3001 20 November 2014                                                                       97


   observations that do not pass the test (personality conflicts, generalizations, perceptions, etc.)
   will be removed from the AAR going up for analysis.
   A5.6.3. The original comments will remain a matter of record for all CoP members to
   review.
   A5.6.4. Validated comments will be assessed to determine if it falls under Doctrine,
   Organization, Training and Education, Material, Leadership or Facilities (DOTMLF).
   A5.6.5. AFCEC/CXD Trends Analyst will use the AAR with Air Component Engineer and
   EOD staff comments to evaluate comments and dissect the AARs into tasks for (EOD)
   technical experts (e.g., AFCEC, A4CXR, NSWC IHEODTD , NAVSCOLEOD, AFCENT,
   AFNORTH, etc.).
   A5.6.6. AFCEC/CXD will provide lessons learned and appropriate feedback to
   AFCEC/CXX for inclusion in the CE Lessons Learned Program and Joint Lessons Learned
   Information System.
   A5.6.7. AFCEC/CXD Trends Analyst will post and track all comments on the AF EOD
   Program Management SharePoint® site; https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-
   A6/21340/OO-EN-CE-49/SitePages/Home.aspx.
   A5.6.8. The issues will then be worked by the EOD panel or responsible staff agencies.
   These members will then work their respective issues and report status back to AFCEC to
   close the loop.
   A5.6.9. AFCEC/CXD will maintain an AAR feedback folder on the EOD Program
   Management CoP.
 98                                                           AFI32-3001 20 November 2014
