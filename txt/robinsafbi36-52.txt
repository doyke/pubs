This instruction reflects Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)-unique changes to Air Force
Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-1, General Civilian Personnel Provisions and Authorities, and AFI
36-102, Basic Authority and Responsibility for Civilian Personnel Management and
Administration. This instruction resulted from the 6 April 2004, Secretary of the Air Force
approval of the waiver to retain Title V Civilian Appointing Authority with AFMC Center
Commanders in conjunction with designating AFMC Air Base Wing (ABW) Commanders as
Installation Commanders. Title V authority rests with the Center Commander on civilian
personnel policy within AFMC. That authority is further delegated to the Director of Personnel
as well as the authority to implement procedures and establish policy for civilian personnel
matters. Such authority may be further delegated by the Director of Personnel as deemed
necessary. This instruction applies to personnel assigned to WR-ALC & 78 ABW. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functionalâ€™s chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


1. Responsibilities: The responsibility for civilian resource management is assigned through
the Air Force chain of command from the Secretary of the Air Force to MAJCOM commanders,
to subordinate commanders and so forth down to first-level supervisors. The objective is to
manage and fully execute civilian human resources within budget while balancing: mission
needs, operational economy and efficiency, skills and career paths, employee development and
motivation, and recruitment and retention of a world-class workforce. This instruction provides
the implementation plan for the management of civilian manpower and funding resources for the
Operating Budget Account Numbers (OBANs) managed by WR-ALC and 78 ABW. It describes
procedures that affirm the roles of the Personnel and Training (P&T) Working Group and the
Force Management and Utilization Board (FMUB), and to have a Civilian Employment Cost
Management Committee (CECMC) for the 78 ABW, such that clear lines of fiscal responsibility,
accountability, and authority are identified.
2. Purpose: To review civilian resource management and budget execution at OBAN level,
periodically review employment plans and compare civilian pay expenditures against budgetary
targets, validate and approve overhire levels so that costs can be tracked and controlled, and
identify any areas of concern which may result in the under execution or over execution of
civilian workyears and funding.
3. Civilian Employment Plan (CEP): WR-ALC must submit a yearly CEP to HQ AFMC/A1K
for review, approval, and monitoring. Compilation and preparation of the CEP is the
responsibility of the Director of Personnel (WR-ALC/DP). The CEP will include separate inputs
from the Center and 78 ABW. WR-ALC/DPR will work closely with the respective financial
counterparts to project a plan which will ensure maximum usage of resources. Oversight and
monitoring of the CEP is performed by WR-ALC/DPR and presented to the FMUB (and Center
senior leadership as needed) typically on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as appropriate.
     3.1. Separate OBANs for the Center and ABW activity require the creation of separate
     CEPs. However, it is recognized that HQ AFMC looks to the Center to manage its
     workforce and the CEP to a bottom line, enterprise level. The CEPs are monitored on a
     monthly basis by the 78 ABW CECMC and the P&T working group prior to presentation at
     the corporate level via the FMUB, which provides Center-wide oversight of workyear and
     civilian pay (see attachment 2) execution. The Center and ABW Commanders each have the
     legal authority to execute funding for pay and non-pay accounts within their respective
     OBANs and each commander is held legally liable for that execution.
     3.2. Using the above referenced model, at attachment 2, the civilian pay and workyear
     execution for each OBAN is reviewed on a monthly basis. 78 ABW (OBAN 47U8 and other
     ABW OBANs) will be reviewed by the 78 ABW CECMC. The Center (OBAN 47E8, other
     Center OBANs to include OBAN 47U8) will be reviewed by the P&T working group. The
     P&T working group will not have authority to change/alter a decision of 78 ABW/CC.
     However, the degree to which such decisions have an impact beyond 78 ABW, the P&T
     working group would present to the FMUB for ratification/decision.
ROBINSAFBI36-52 18 AUGUST 2011                                                                  3


       3.2.1. The purpose of the P&T working group is to review and compare the CEP
       projection to actual workyear and payroll execution. In addition to reviewing execution
       status, the group will review vacancy status, over hire status, utilization of reimbursable
       authorizations, as well as issues associated with overtime, appraisals, awards, engineering
       recruitment/retention program, training program requirements, etc., as warranted. Also,
       this forum will provide recommendations to respective commanders in order to ensure
       maximum utilization of resources as well as a strategic prioritization within each OBAN.
       In addition, the P&T working group is to serve as the integrator regarding civilian pay
       and workyear execution (and build of enterprise recommendations and solutions) for
       presentation to the FMUB and/or Center senior leadership for decision.
       3.2.2. WR-ALC/DPR and 78 CPTS will serve as the executive agents for the monthly
       ABW CECMCs. The CECMC will be chaired by the 78 ABW Vice Commander, with
       representatives from each organization funded by ABW OBANs. Membership will
       include Group Commanders, functional managers and representatives from DP and 78
       CPTS.
       3.2.3. The P&T Working Group will be chaired by WR-ALC/DPR. Membership will
       include representatives from the Wings/Directorates, Center Staff Offices, 78 CPTS and
       WR-ALC/FM.
       3.2.4. The FMUB is chaired by WR-ALC/CA who will review CEP execution from an
       enterprise-wide perspective, with intended purpose to adjust course of action as necessary
       to ensure WR-ALC workyear and civilian pay execution, as well as attendant matters, are
       on course to achieve Center mission objectives. The Center senior leadership will be
       briefed as deemed necessary by the FMUB.
   3.3. Separate Center and ABW workyear targets are provided by HQ AFMC/A1K normally
   prior to the beginning of the fiscal year in the initial CEP guidance. Actual movement of
   funds and authorizations will be at the discretion of the Center Commander after approval by
   HQ AFMC; workyears may be shared in order to achieve balance of a combined workyear
   target. Integrated Center and ABW CEPs allow the two organizations to compensate for
   fluctuations in employment levels and fully utilize their allocated funds and workyears from
   an enterprise perspective.
       3.3.1. Both the Center and ABW CEPs must be coordinated through the appropriate
       channels prior to their release.
       3.3.2. Individual CEPs for the Center and ABW will be submitted to the Center
       Commander by WR-ALC/DP for final approval; this submission will include an analysis
       for corporate mission impact. Upon approval, the Director of Personnel (WR-ALC/DP)
       will submit the CEP to HQ AFMC/A1K.
4. Sub-allocation of the Manpower Program to AFMC Field Units: The Director of
Personnel acts as the primary POC for the Center manpower program. As such, WR-ALC/DPR
monitors total funded manpower authorizations across the enterprise by Program Element Code
(PEC) and category (officer, enlisted, civilian) ensuring monthly reconciliation to the official
manpower program allocation provided by AFMC/A1M. End strength changes, increases and/or
decreases, result from programmatic decisions disseminated by AFMC/A1M. In turn, WR-

ALC/DPR works with local resource managers within wing, directorate, and staff offices to
process authorization change requests (ACR) to the UMD as required.
     4.1. The Workforce and Resources Division, WR-ALC/DPR, manages the manpower
     program for the Center.
        4.1.1. Authorization Change Requests (ACR) affecting any PEC must be coordinated
        with WR-ALC/DPR and such adjustments will be captured in recurring updates to the 78
        ABW CECMC, P&T working group and FMUB.
        4.1.2. Manpower Program Adjustment (MPA) memos issued by HQ AFMC/A1M flow
        to WR-ALC/DPR for review and posting to the UMD. WR-ALC/DPR determines which
        missions/programs are impacted by the MPA and initiates contact with affected
        organizations to secure ACR documentation, e.g., position number, grade, series, etc. to
        implement the appropriate program change.
        4.1.3. When MPAs are received which have an impact on PECs that cross Center and 78
        ABW OBANs, or are non-PEC specific, WR-ALC/DPR will use the FMUB to allocate
        the new program.
        4.1.4. Manpower authorization changes requiring funding adjustments (within or
        between PECs) will be coordinated with the respective financial management
        organizations to ensure proper funding alignment.
     4.2. The Center Commander has flexibility to realign manpower authorizations without
     higher headquarters coordination to include internal PEC swaps that maintain the manpower
     programâ€™s current allocation. Higher headquarters coordination is required if the Center
     wishes to revise its existing PEC allocation which is typically done during the Program
     Objective Memorandum (POM) cycle. Manpower authorization realignments or PEC swaps
     between local units (including between the Center and ABW) requires HQ AFMC/A1M
     approval. This approval will be obtained by WR-ALC/DP for all WR-ALC units.
     4.3. WR-ALC/DPR will update Unit Manpower Documents (UMD) for supported
     organizations upon receipt of Manpower Program Adjustment memorandums from HQ
     AFMC/A1M, or upon receipt of a duly authorized ACR, (attachment 3).
