                                                Chapter 1

                        POLICES, PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this directive is to implement federal law which assigns NTSB and FAA
responsibility or interest in certain mishaps involving military aircraft.
    1.1.1. Because various agencies and departments have differing policies and procedures regarding
    witnesses, analysis and the release of information, a joint military-civil investigation with shared
    responsibility is not possible.
    1.1.2. This directive strives to foster cooperation during the investigations of aircraft mishaps involv-
    ing both civil and military aircraft, while adhering to the unique requirements of civil and military
    investigations.
    1.1.3. Since the common goal of safety investigations is mishap prevention, cooperation between mil-
    itary and civil agencies is both logical and desirable.

1.2. Responsibility. The Air Force Chief of Safety (HQ USAF/SE) is the executive agent for this
interservice publication. Each participant uses component-unique publications to implement this instruc-
tion. If a participant alters these policies or procedures because of unique operating procedures, it indi-
cates applicability to that service or agency only.
    1.2.1. Changes to this publication should be sent to HQ Air Force Safety Center (AFSC)/Plans and
    Programs Division (SEP), 9700 G Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670.

1.3. Types of Investigations. An aircraft mishap can precipitate multiple investigations for alternate pur-
poses and under separate authorities.
    1.3.1. Mishaps are investigated for two primary reasons; 1) to determine the cause (s) of the mishap
    to prevent the recurrence of like mishaps, and 2) to satisfy legal or administrative concerns.
       1.3.1.1. A safety investigation promotes aviation safety by identifying mishap circumstances (i.e.,
       hazards) which, if eliminated or reduced, could prevent the recurrence of the mishap. A safety
       investigation recommends corrective actions to reduce or eliminate hazards.
       1.3.1.2. Other investigations may be conducted by military authorities and others for a variety of
       purposes, such as providing a basis for administrative or judicial proceeding, claims or entitle-
       ments. An administrative investigation may conclude culpability and may recommend punitive
       action.
    1.3.2. Depending on the circumstances of the mishap, jurisdictions of both civil and military authori-
    ties may apply simultaneously.
       1.3.2.1. The military derives its authority to investigate mishaps from the statutory and inherent
       authority of the respective service secretary. Procedures for mishap reporting and investigation,
       and policies on the release of information are contained in respective service implementing direc-
       tives listed in Attachment 1.
       1.3.2.2. Title 49, U.S.C. Chapter 11 assigns the NTSB the responsibility to investigate civil air-
       craft mishaps within the United States, its territories and possessions, including those involving
       both a civil and military aircraft. The NTSB is a separate federal agency, independent of the
AFI91-206(I) 8 JULY 2004                                                                                   5


       Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Transportation (DOT) and Department of Home-
       land Security (DHS). A NTSB aircraft investigation has priority over any other investigation by
       another federal agency or department. Concurrent investigations are not joint with the NTSB and
       may not interfere with NTSB activities. The NTSB has subpoena power to compel a witness’
       statement or testimony. NTSB procedures for investigations and reporting are contained in Title
       49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter VIII, Parts 800 et seq., Parts 830 (Notification)
       and 831 (Investigation).
   1.3.3. This directive discusses three types of investigations; the NTSB accident investigation, the mil-
   itary mishap safety investigation, and the military mishap administrative investigation.
       1.3.3.1. The NTSB accident investigation is conducted in the public interest to promote aviation
       safety. NTSB proceedings differ from military investigations especially in the areas regarding wit-
       nesses and information release. In a NTSB investigation a witness can be subpoenaed to appear
       before the Board to provide a statement or testimony, but the witness cannot be compelled to
       incriminate themselves, the witness is entitled to representation or counsel, and the witness’ state-
       ment or testimony is not privileged and relevant portions become part of the NTSB’s public inves-
       tigation record. The NTSB’s report, cause determination and recommended corrective actions are
       public records, but are not admissible in court as evidence.
       1.3.3.2. The military mishap safety investigation is an internal inquiry by the respective service
       conducted solely for the purpose of mishap prevention. In soliciting information from personnel
       involved in the mishap, the investigative board may grant a promise of confidentiality to a witness
       to assure them that the information they provide will only be used to prevent further mishaps and
       will not be released for any other purpose. Portions of a military safety investigation report contain
       privileged information and documents, not releasable to the public.
       1.3.3.3. The military mishap administrative investigation is conducted apart from a military mis-
       hap safety investigation. Such investigations may take a variety of forms, and may involve witness
       testimony under oath. Witnesses may be represented by counsel and must be informed of their
       rights against self-incrimination if they are suspected of a criminal offense. Statements may gener-
       ally be admitted as evidence against the witness or used in any other manner. The military admin-
       istrative investigation and report satisfy the requirement for legal and administrative
       documentation of a mishap. The report meets the requirement for legal sufficiency and is releas-
       able to the NTSB, the FAA, and the public.

1.4. Security. Security matters are administered according to military service regulations.
   1.4.1. The commander of the unit to which the mishap aircraft was assigned, the commander of the
   nearest military installation, and the commander conducting the investigation are responsible for the
   security of any classified material associated with the mishap.
   1.4.2. The senior member of the military investigation board (i.e., the board president) is responsible
   for ensuring all board participants that have access to classified material have the appropriate security
   clearance.
   1.4.3. In a NTSB investigation, the military coordinator provides liaison for security matters between
   the NTSB Investigator-in-Charge (IIC) and the appropriate military authority.
6                                                                             AFI91-206(I) 8 JULY 2004


    1.4.4. In a mishap involving classified material, military authorities must identify an appropriate
    access level so the NTSB and FAA may assign personnel with the appropriate clearances. Not all
    NTSB and FAA personnel hold security clearances.
       1.4.4.1. Official notification from the NTSB and the FAA to military authorities of the clearances
       agency personnel hold and the presentation of agency credentials will constitute evidence of clear-
       ance.
    1.4.5. In a NTSB investigation not all participants may have security clearances. If classified material
    is involved, the military authority and the NTSB will determine if such material is central or incidental
    to the mishap, and take appropriate actions to limit access to the material to those personnel with the
    appropriate clearance and need to know.

                                                Chapter 2

                  NTSB INVESTIGATION WITH MILITARY PARTICIPATION

2.1. General. A mishap involving both civil and military aircraft will precipitate a NTSB investigation.
Military investigations for safety or legal purposes may proceed concurrently, but the NTSB may exercise
first claim on evidence. To assist these separate investigations, it is important that nonprivileged informa-
tion concerning the mishap be exchanged promptly and completely.
   2.1.1. NTSB proceedings differ from military investigations, however, the NTSB’s experience in
   investigations of general and commercial aviation accidents has established the validity of its method.

2.2. Organization. The NTSB IIC will organize the investigation in a manner considered expedient to
develop evidence. Organization is flexible and may be adjusted as lines of inquiry conclude or new topics
open.
   2.2.1. The IIC will usually form groups, each chaired by a NTSB investigator, to concentrate on spe-
   cific topics appropriate to the aircraft or mishap. Examples would be groups for operations, airframe,
   powerplants, weather, or human factors.

2.3. Participation. The NTSB will admit into its investigation individuals or representatives of govern-
ment agencies, corporations, or associations whose personnel, products or services were involved in the
mishap.
   2.3.1. By law, the FAA may exercise party status in NTSB aviation investigations, and a military ser-
   vice may also exercise party status in the NTSB investigation of a mishap involving that service’s air-
   craft.
   2.3.2. Additional parties may be admitted at the IIC’s discretion, as he determines a need for technical
   expertise or the unique knowledge a party can provide. Claimants’ or insurers’ representatives are not
   admitted to the investigation.
   2.3.3. Participation in the investigation does not include admission to NTSB analysis to determine
   cause and formulate corrective action.
   2.3.4. A party to an investigation is a company or agency with specific knowledge or skill needed by
   the NTSB to perform the investigation. Parties furnish a coordinator to work with the IIC, and special-
   ists to one or more specialized investigative groups at an accident scene.
   2.3.5. The IIC may relieve a party from participating in the investigation for nonperformance or con-
   duct prejudicial to the investigation.

2.4. Witnesses. The NTSB has subpoena power and can compel a witness to appear before its field
investigator, at a public hearing, or formal deposition, to provide a statement or testimony, but it cannot
compel the witness to provide incriminating statements or testimony.
   2.4.1. A witness providing a statement to a field investigator is not normally sworn, however a wit-
   ness at a public hearing or formal deposition testifies under oath. In either case the witness is advised
   of the investigation’s purpose.
   2.4.2. Any statement or testimony becomes part of the investigation record.
8                                                                            AFI91-206(I) 8 JULY 2004


    2.4.3. A witness may be accompanied or advised by counsel or a representative of his choice.
    2.4.4. Depending on the format used by the IIC or group chairman, parties may be allowed to attend
    interviews and questioning of witnesses.

2.5. Investigation Sequence. An NTSB investigation usually proceeds as follows.
    2.5.1. Field Investigation. The IIC, group chair, and parties gather at a location near the mishap site.
    A Member of the NTSB proper may also be present if the mishap is of national significance or wide
    pubic interest.
       2.5.1.1. The IIC will hold an organizational meeting, exclude any whom he does not wish to admit
       as parties to the investigation, summarize available information, appoint groups, and assign tasks.
       2.5.1.2. The field investigation encompasses wreckage examination, component disassembly,
       data or record retrieval, and witness interviews. Such activities may involve travel to other loca-
       tions as the IIC or group chair considers appropriate.
       2.5.1.3. The IIC will hold a daily progress meeting of all parties involved to hear group chair
       present evidence and to direct further activities.
       2.5.1.4. The field investigation will adjourn when the IIC is satisfied of its sufficiency. The chair
       of each group will assemble a factual report for the IIC’s inclusion in the investigation record.
    2.5.2. Research and Component Examination. The NTSB’s engineering staff and laboratory can per-
    form scientific examination of material exhibits and conduct performance research. Additionally,
    NTSB technical specialists can decipher and display various recorded data (i.e., radar, voice, and data
    recorders) for the investigators’ use.
       2.5.2.1. An engineering or technical project by the NTSB will be documented in a factual report
       which becomes part of the investigation record.
    2.5.3. Public Hearing. As appropriate, a hearing may be convened to conduct part of the inquiry in a
    public forum. Parties to the investigation are included in the hearing.
    2.5.4. Determining Cause. Analysis to determine the cause(s) of the mishap is conducted internally
    among NTSB personnel only (i.e., IIC, group chair, engineering and technical staffs). This process is
    closed to parties.
       2.5.4.1. Parties may submit written positions drawn from the evidence to propose findings, a
       probable cause or causes, and recommendations. These submissions become part of the investiga-
       tion record. The Board considers the body of evidence, its staff’s analysis and any submissions, to
       assign factor and probable cause.

2.6. Recommendations. When it finds an opportunity to promote aviation safety, the Board recommends
corrective action(s) to appropriate agencies, corporations or associations.
    2.6.1. Parties may make written submissions proposing corrective action(s).

2.7. Board Meeting. For an accident of national significance or wide public interest, a public Board
Meeting may be convened after the investigation has been concluded, but before the investigation report
is released.
AFI91-206(I) 8 JULY 2004                                                                                  9


   2.7.1. NTSB personnel summarize evidence and may present analysis.
   2.7.2. The Board will consider and vote upon findings, recommendations, and the probable cause(s).
   2.7.3. Parties, the press and the public may attend.
   2.7.4. A videotape of the Board Meeting is placed in the public docket for the investigation, along
   with the aircraft accident report (AAR).

2.8. Mishap Information.
   2.8.1. Press and Public Relations. The NTSB responds to press and public interest in its investigation
   with prepared releases or through a selected spokesman. Only the IIC, the Member present at the mis-
   hap scene, or the NTSB Office of Public Affairs may publicly release information concerning findings
   or the conduct of the investigation.
   2.8.2. Reports. The NTSB staff writes and assembles the AAR which may include factual reports by
