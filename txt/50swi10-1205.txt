This instruction implements provisions of Air Force Space Command Instruction (AFSPCI) 10-
1204, Satellite Operations, by establishing criteria to define mission degradation and System
Capabilities (SYSCAP) and Operational Capabilities (OPSCAP). This instruction is applicable
to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) personnel when on duty status. This publication does
not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG). Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records and disposed of IAW the Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate organizational chain of
command. This instruction will be updated as needed to reflect the most current roles and
responsibilities as future capabilities and concepts become operational. The use of the name or
mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this
publication does not imply endorsement by the AF. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of
references and supporting information.

1. SYSCAP: Is a continuous assessment of the capability of a system or program to perform its
mission. The use of SYSCAP will be left to the discretion of the group commander. OPSCAP is
a continuous assessment of the capability of the major components of a system or program to
perform the mission. SYSCAP and OPSCAP assessments support real-time planning and serve
as a measure of system capability.

    1.1. AFSPCI 10-1204, Satellite Operations, directs Space Wings (SW) to develop specific
    criteria to define mission degradation. The following conditions will be used to determine if
    a SYSCAP or OPSCAP change has taken place and to classify the type of change.
    1.2. Fully Mission Capable (FMC)/Green Condition: Equipment/systems are capable of
    performing required functions with no loss of mission capability.
       1.2.1. Partially Mission Capable (PMC)/Yellow Condition:            Units will define
       requirements for PMC based on one or both of the following definitions:
       1.2.1.1. Equipment/systems are capable of performing limited functions such that they
       can accomplish at least one, but not all mission requirements.
       1.2.1.2. Equipment/systems with redundant capabilities have lost sufficient redundancy
       resulting in loss of mission support
       1.2.2. Standby (SB)/White Condition: Equipment/systems are in standby mode,
       undergoing testing, or awaiting check out.
       1.2.3. Not Mission Capable (NMC)/Red Condition: Equipment/systems are unable to
       accomplish any mission requirements due to complete or nearly complete loss of
       functionality.
    1.3. Each 50 SW unit will utilize SYSCAP and/or OPSCAP guidelines approved by the 50
    Operations Group Commander (50 OG/CC) or 50 Network Operations Group Commander
    (50 NOG/CC), as appropriate, to report capability changes. Degradations will be assessed 30
    minutes from the initial indications of the problem or at the Squadron Commander or
    Director of Operations discretion.
