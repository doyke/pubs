This instruction implements AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection, AFI 40-201, Managing
Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force, AFMAN 48-125, Personnel Ionizing Radiation
Dosimetry, and AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medicine Program, and defines guidelines,
responsibilities, procedures and precautionary measures for the control of ionizing radiation
sources, consistent with Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards. It does
not apply to non-ionizing radiation, radio-frequency or laser radiation, and patient care or combat
related exposures. Air Force policy is to keep all ionizing radiation exposures As Low as
Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). This instruction implements the ALARA concept by
establishing a program that incorporates current radiation protection requirements and additional
management controls, outlining procedures for the control of ionizing radiation sources and
associated hazards to safeguard workers health, while permitting maximum benefits from
radiation sources. Compliance with this instruction is mandatory for all organizations and
persons covered by the 22 ARW Occupational Health Program. Section 12 of this instruction
applies to all organizations and persons, including contractors, conducting operations involving
ionizing radiation sources on 22 ARW properties. This instruction is derived from documents
listed as references, in the event of a conflict with an Air Force Instruction, defer to the higher
guidance. This instruction directs collecting and maintaining information subject to the Privacy
Act of 1974 in regards to F044 AF SG of the USAF Master Radiation Exposure Registry.

     EXPOSURE MONITORING (THERMOLUMINESCENT DOSIMETRY (TLD)
                            PROGRAM)

4.1. The Installation RSO will identify workplaces where radioactive material or radiation
producing device use has the potential to expose radiation workers above 10% of the annual dose
limit and direct Thermoluminescent Dosimetry (TLD) Program monitoring as a control for the
exposure group. The installation RSO will also direct TLD Program monitoring for pregnant
workers or workers under the age of 18 who are likely to exceed the limits identified in AFMAN
48-125.
4.2. The Installation RSO will define the type of TLD monitoring (whole body, collar, etc),
monitoring frequency, and Investigation Action Level for each exposure group (or individual)
and document the rationale for these decisions in the appropriate Defense Occupational
Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS) database risk assessment.
4.3. The Installation RSO will provide unit commanders, Unit RSOs (where applicable), and
workplace supervisors a written report outlining the TLD monitoring requirements for their
workplace, or “TLD Area”, including a definition of the areas and activities where TLD badges
need to be worn, identifying workers to enroll in the program, proper wear and storage of TLD
badges, and training requirements.
4.4. Supervisors will coordinate unit program requirements and execution (delivery/change
out procedures, etc) with the TLD Program Manager.
4.5. Supervisors will ensure badges are properly worn and handled per AFMAN 48-125,
Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry.
4.6. Workers in TLD Area workplaces will report to Bioenvironmental Engineering for
enrollment into the TLD Program prior to conducting any duties that involve ionizing radiation.
4.7. Workers in TLD Area workplaces that wear a TLD badge during non-Air Force
employment will ensure that the TLD Program Manager receives a copy of their TLD results.
The TLD Program Manager will forward the results to the USAF Master Radiation Exposure
Registry.
4.8. Workers in TLD Area workplaces who perform duties involving ionizing radiation at a
temporary duty (TDY)(or deployment) location will coordinate TLD monitoring continuity with
the TLD Program Manager at least 1 week prior to departing their home station.
   4.8.1. For TDY/deployments anticipated to be 90 days or less, the TLD Program Manager
   will issue a designated transit control dosimeter and advise the member on proper monitoring
   procedures while TDY.
   4.8.2. For TDY/deployments anticipated to be over 90 days, the TLD Program Manager will
   determine if the TDY/deployment location is supported by an Air Force TLD monitoring
   program, advise the member on how to arrange for the appropriate preventive medicine
   support, and inform the member on documentation requirements.
4.9. The Installation RSO will review TLD results for each TLD Area and direct an
investigation for lost badges or exposures above the Investigation Action Level (Attachment 2).

  4.9.1. The Installation RSO will review exposure limits and follow the procedures outlined
  in AFMAN 48-125, (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8) and AFI 48-148 for investigating and
  reporting abnormal or overexposure results.
  4.9.2. For lost badges or exposures above the Investigation Action Level, but below
  abnormal exposure levels, the TLD Program Manager will prepare a letter to the TLD Area
  Monitor requesting an explanation of the lost badge or excessive exposure(s). The
  Installation RSO will review the response and determine if additional control or education
  efforts are required to keep exposures ALARA.
  4.9.3. The Installation RSO will direct an investigation if a personnel dosimetry result
  indicates the exposure to the fetus will exceed 500 mrem (50 mrem on a monthly badge) if
  the dose rate continues for the course of a workers pregnancy, and advise the
  member/supervisor on actions needed to prevent fetal overexposure.

Abnormal Exposure—An exposure received in any monitoring period that, if continued at the
same rate would exceed the limits specified in 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
Determine an abnormal exposure dose equivalent by dividing the applicable (stochastic or
nonstochastic) annual limit by the number of monitoring periods during the year. For stochastic
exposures, an abnormal exposure is 417 millirem (mrem) [4.2 milliSievert (mSv)] for any
monthly monitoring period and 1250 mrem (12.5 mSv) for any quarterly monitoring period.
ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) Program—A set of management and
administrative actions taken to reduce personnel radiation exposures to as low as reasonably
achievable. The ALARA concept was developed in response to scientific evidence that suggests
that no level of ionizing radiation exposure is totally risk free.
ALARA Action Level—Locally established radiation exposure limits for personnel dosimetry
results that are less than the Air Force established criteria used to flag exposures that are above
normal, higher than expected or could potentially result in an abnormal exposure if trends
continue. Informal investigation is conducted by permit RSO to determine the specifics of the
exposure, such as change in workload, tasks, or position. Results are reported to the Radiation
Safety Committee.

Area TLD Monitor—Person assigned by the unit or section responsible for enforcing OI/STDs
of the TLD program for that unit or area.
TLD—Thermoluminescent Dosimeter—The personnel dosimeter is used to indicate a close
approximation of the exposure dose to ionizing radiation to ensure exposures are maintained
ALARA. The badge contains a thermoluminescent dosimetry packet. The packet is exchanged
monthly or quarterly depending on the area where an individual works.
Pregnant Worker Action Level—Personnel dosimetry result which, if continued for the term of
pregnancy, would exceed the 500 mrem/9 month’s exposure limit for the fetus. This equates to
approximately 55 mrem on a monthly TLD.

       NON-AIR FORCE ORGANIZATIONS/CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS

A3.1. Non-Air Force organizations/contractors performing services involving use of their own
RAM or ionizing RPD under the auspices of their own USNRC or Agreement State License shall
send a request to the Base RSO at least 30 calendar days, or as soon as notified/contracted if
less than 30 days, before bringing/conducting operations involving RAM or RPD on Air Force
installations. Per AFI 40-201 requests must be in writing and include:
   A3.1.1. A brief description of the proposed activities:
   A3.1.2. A copy of a current NRC or Agreement State license with current NRC Form 241,
   Report of Proposed Activities in Non-Agreement States, Areas of Exclusive Federal
   Jurisdiction, or Offshore Waters specifying specific use locations. The NRC Reciprocity
   Form (NRC Form 241) must accompany the Agreement State license. The license must
   either specifically list the installation or grant approval for work at temporary job sites
   anywhere in the United States where the NRC or Agreement State has jurisdiction.
NOTE: Operations on property that is not exclusive federal jurisdiction will need to pay
reciprocity. Likewise, State licensees may not work on Air Force or other installations where
exclusive federal jurisdiction exists unless pre-coordinated and reciprocity is paid to the NRC.


EXCEPTION: Contractors using generally licensed materials (e.g., certain NITON Lead Paint
Analyzers) and DoE or DoE prime contractors operating in accordance with 10 CFR Part 835 do
