                                           Chapter 1

                                         OVERVIEW

1.1. General. AFGSC conducts the ICBM OT&E program to provide accuracy and reliability
planning factors to the Commander, United States Strategic Command (CDRUSSTRATCOM),
and evaluate the operational effectiveness and suitability of system modifications or upgrades
prior to initial fielding. ICBM OT&E includes OTL, SELM, SOT, WST and other operational
testing.
   1.1.1. OTLs, designated GLORY TRIP, consist of flight tests of operational ICBMs in a
   peacetime environment in as near to the operational flight environment as possible from first
   stage ignition to impact.
   1.1.2. SELMs, designated GIANT PACE, provide the most complete test of the deployed
   ICBM force from crew commit actions through issuance of the Minuteman (MM) first stage
   ignition signal.
   1.1.3. SOTs consist of testing the Console Operating Program (COP) and Baseline Updates
   of the Higher Authority Communications/Rapid Message Processing Element (HAC/RMPE).
   AFGSC tests the COP and HAC/RMPE operational software to ensure each software change
   meets USSTRATCOM and AFGSC needs.
   1.1.4. WST verifies overall alert readiness of the deployed ICBM weapon system,
   independent of the SELM test environment, through the means of two tests:
       1.1.4.1. Monthly, operational unit-initiated weapon system tests designated OLYMPIC
       PLAY.
       1.1.4.2. Bi-weekly, Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio tests, designated GIANT BALL,
       performed by the Air Launch Control System (ALCS) on the alert force Launch Facilities
       (LFs)/Launch Control Centers (LCC).
   1.1.5. Other tests consist of testing modifications or upgrades to the operational weapon
   system and/or support equipment, to include the Launch Facility (LF), Missile Alert Facility
   (MAF) and associated support equipment.
1.2. Objectives:
   1.2.1. OTL objectives. Basic objectives of the OTL program are to establish accuracy and
   reliability planning factors under representative operational test conditions, detect trends or
   changes in weapon system accuracy and reliability, identify areas for weapon system
   modification/improvement, and verify operational effectiveness and suitability. Weapon
   system accuracy, reliability, and performance are primary test objectives on every OTL to
   include an assessment of Mk 12A and Mk 21 re-entry vehicles (RV) to meet Department of
   Energy (DOE) and AFGSC requirements. OTL task force (TF) objectives will include an
   assessment of technical data, procedures and adequacy of training in an operationally
   realistic environment from stockpile to target. Aging surveillance objectives will be
   considered at the request of AFNWC ICBM Systems Division (AFNWC/NWI). Special test
   objectives such as targeting at extended ranges or testing RV modifications will be
   accomplished as required. ALCS will be tested at a minimum of once per fiscal year during
6                                                             AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


    an OTL. To achieve these basic objectives, individual mission test objectives are identified
    as category (Cat) I, II or III.
       1.2.1.1. Cat I. Achievement of Cat I objectives is mandatory for a successful program,
       mission or test. Not achieving a category I objective would significantly impact program
       schedules, costs and verification of system performance. AFGSC/A3I or designated
       representative will have Cat I test objective waiver authority. If an associated operation
       is granted Cat I status, AFGSC/A3I or designated representative will have waiver
       authority for that associated operation.
       1.2.1.2. Cat II. Achievement of Cat II objectives is required to make the program,
       mission, or test a complete success. These objectives may be waived due to performance,
       cost, time, or other constraints. A launch will not be rescheduled to meet a Cat II
       objective. A launch countdown may be held to achieve a Cat II objective unless the hold
       would adversely affect achievement of a Cat I objective. Commander, 576th Flight Test
       Squadron (576 FLTS/CC) or designated representative will have waiver authority for Cat
       II test objectives. If an associated operation is granted category II status, 576 FLTS/CC
       or designated representative will have waiver authority for that associated operation.
       1.2.1.3. Cat III. Achievement of a Cat III objective is desired for design or
       environmental research, associated operations or a supporting engineering effort.
       Generally, these objectives would be beneficial to achieve if support can be provided
       within existing support agency capabilities. A launch countdown will not be rescheduled
       but may be held at the discretion of the Mission Director (MD) to achieve a Cat III OTL
       objective. The launch countdown will not be held if it adversely affects achievement of
       Cat I or II objectives. The MD will have waiver authority for Cat III objectives.
    1.2.2. SELM Objectives. The basic SELM objective is to assess reliability of ICBM weapon
    systems (including the ALCS) in their deployed environment. To achieve this basic
    objective, individual test objectives are identified as Cat I, Cat II, or special.
       1.2.2.1. Cat I. Achievement of Cat I objectives are mandatory for a successful program
       or test.
           1.2.2.1.1. Cat I objectives include:
               1.2.2.1.1.1. Verifying the capability of the LCC and the ALCS to process
               required launch commands.
               1.2.2.1.1.2. Verifying the capability of the LF ground system electronics and
               missile guidance ground program systems to process the launch sequence during
               the terminal countdown sequence.
               1.2.2.1.1.3. Providing reliability data for the ICBM weapon system to
               Headquarters Air Force Global Strike Command Force Employment Branch (HQ
               AFGSC/A3IN) and AFNWC/NWI.
           1.2.2.1.2. AFGSC/A3I or designated representative will have waiver authority for
           Cat I objectives.
       1.2.2.2. Cat II. Achievement of Cat II objectives are required to make the program or
       test a complete success. These objectives are developed by 576 FLTS and are
       coordinated with HQ AFGSC/A3IT and AFNWC/NWIEI ―System Engineering Level
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                      7


     Evaluation Correction Team (SELECT)‖ and approved as part of the Test Plan. The goal
     of Cat II objectives is to exercise the deployed weapon system to its design limits.
         1.2.2.2.1. These objectives may be waived due to performance, cost, time or other
         constraints. 576 FLTS/CC or designated representative will have waiver authority for
         Cat II objectives.
     1.2.2.3. Special. Achievement of special objectives can either be Cat I or Cat II for a
     successful program or test. Special objectives are test specific. AFGSC/A3I or
     designated representative in consultation with HQ AFGSC/A3IT/A3IN/Current
     Operations Branch (A3IA) and/or AFNWC/NWIEI ―SELECT‖ will have waiver
     authority for special objectives.
  1.2.3. SOT Objectives. The purpose of SOT is to validate each new revision of operational
  software and proper system operation within the Minuteman III command, control and
  communication (C3) system and to evaluate operational effectiveness and suitability of the
  software. As defined, SOT is only used for changes to the HAC/RMPE and COP software.
  Other types of software testing are addressed in paragraph 1.2.5. and Chapter 6 of this
  instruction.
     1.2.3.1. SOTs are conducted in as realistic an operational environment as possible. This
     focus on operational realism in both planning and execution is important to ensure all
     deficiencies are identified before the software is fielded. SOT provides an independent
     evaluation of modifications to the software and supporting systems. SOTs demonstrate
     and assess system software improvements, modifications and performance and ensure
     functionality is not adversely affected. To ensure adequate evaluation, operational testing
     is planned using operationally representative test assets and facilities at Vandenberg
     AFB, CA (VAFB) and/or Hill AFB, UT.
  1.2.4. WST Objectives. WSTs verify the readiness of the ICBM alert force and provide data
  for estimating launch reliability throughout the lifecycle of the deployed weapon system.
     1.2.4.1. OLYMPIC PLAY Testing. OLYMPIC PLAY tests contribute to both the
     development of planning factors and AFNWC/NWI’s Weapon System Aging
     Surveillance Program. OLYMPIC PLAY allows AFGSC to test the ICBM weapon
     system in its deployed environment without breaking operational configuration to install
     test equipment or instrumentation.
  1.2.5. Objectives of other operational testing. Other operational testing is used to provide an
  independent evaluation of a system, software and/or component in accordance with AFI 99-
  103, to measure operational effectiveness and suitability prior to production or fielding. The
  system, software and/or component under test will be referred to as ―system under test‖
  (SUT) from this point forward. Reporting supports production or operational fielding
  decisions for each SUT.
     1.2.5.1. Other operational testing will be conducted under as operationally realistic
     conditions as possible. This may at times require testing to be performed at facilities
     outside VAFB or Hill AFB, UT. In such cases, focus will be on conducting testing in as
     realistic operational conditions as possible for the SUT.
     1.2.5.2. Organizations requiring ICBM OT&E will ensure testers are involved early in
     the acquisition process in accordance with AFI 99-103, to include requirements-
     development, Integrated Test Teams and developmental test and evaluation. This will
 8                                                          AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


        allow a better understanding of the SUT’s operation and help to ensure OT&E is
        projected, funded and can be conducted with minimal impact to the projected fielding
        schedule.
1.3. Guidance. Operational realism is second only to safety when conducting ICBM OT&E.
Weapon systems tested as FDE must be, as much as possible, representative of the deployed
force and employed environment. This concept governs configuration of facilities, selection of
missiles, makeup and deployment of TFs, and use of technical data and flight profile/targeting
options. For an ICBM OTL and SELM, the selected missile(s) should normally be on
emergency war order (EWO) alert to be eligible for designation as a test asset. Selected
equipment will be flown "as is" unless damaged as a result of removal and emplacement or if a
problem may jeopardize the flight.
1.4. Security. In addition to safety and operational realism, security is an important
consideration for all ICBM OT&E. Refer to the ICBM Security Classification/Declassification
Guide (SCG) for further information regarding the classification of ICBM OT&E results.
1.5. ICBM OT&E Process. The ICBM OT&E process consists of three parts: test planning,
test execution and test reporting. All test reports (interim and final) will be handled at a
minimum as Unclassified//For Official Use Only. Figure 1.1. Illustrates the performance report
preparation process.

                    Figure 1.1. Performance Report Preparation Process.




     1.5.1. Effective Test Program. Requirements for an effective test program include clearly
     defined test objectives, defining elements to be measured and the means by which they are
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                      9


  measured, developing a means of comparing test results against established requirements,
  standards and goals, and accurately reporting to the customer(s). To fulfill these
  requirements, every test conducted under ICBM OT&E will include the following:
     1.5.1.1. Based on customer requirements, HQ AFGSC/A3IT will prepare a test order
     (TO) in accordance with paragraph 1.13.3.4. TOs will be valid for 2 years.
     1.5.1.2. For all AFGSC-conducted ICBM OT&E, 576 FLTS will be the operational test
     organization (OTO). 576 FLTS/CC or a designated representative will be the MD for all
     ICBM tests. The OTO will appoint a test manager (TM), prepare a test plan (TP), write
     detailed test procedures to properly execute the test and prepare a report providing
     detailed results after test execution.
         1.5.1.2.1. For each ICBM OT&E program OT, excluding OTL (e.g. SELM, SOT,
         other operational testing), 576 FLTS will coordinate an individual TP and/or TP
         updates to HQ AFGSC/A3IT no later than (NLT) 60 days prior to the Test Readiness
         Review Board (TRRB) and have AFGSC/A3 approval NLT 30 days prior to the
         TRRB. OTL TPs for recurring launches will be written bi-annually and cover all
         OTLs during the TP effective period. 576 FLTS will coordinate OTL TP renewal
         NLT 90 days prior to expiration of the previous TP. Supplemental OTL test
         objectives (e.g. extended range launches, RV fuze modifications, etc.) will require an
         amendment to the existing OTL TP to assess the specific objectives under test. These
         amended TPs will be coordinated through HQ AFGSC/A3IT no later than (NLT) 60
         days prior to the Test Readiness Review Board and have AFGSC/A3 approval NLT
         30 days prior to TRRB. Non-OTL approved TPs and OTL TP amendments are only
         valid for the duration of each OT. However, TPs may be utilized for a supplemental
         test under certain circumstances (e.g. urgent/emergency SOT following a scheduled
         Baseline Update, ―-1‖ tests, etc.).
     1.5.1.3. 576 FLTS/Standardization and Evaluation (OGV) will prepare a Test Execution
     Order (TEO) containing specific requirements that each participating unit must
     accomplish to ensure mission success. Amendments to the TEO will be published and
     distributed to participating units.
     1.5.1.4. Test Reports will be coordinated through HQ AFGSC/A3IT NLT 30 days prior
     to the supported decision (e.g. fielding decision, Milestone C decision, etc.) (see Chapters
     2 and 3 for OTL and SELM reporting requirements, which differ) in order to provide
     adequate time for review and approval. Delivery timelines may be tailored to
     accommodate accelerated test schedules for specific user needs (e.g. as outlined in the
     Concept for Software Support for HAC/RMPE and MMP Software) if coordinated with
     HQ AFGSC/A3 and included in the applicable TP. Reports must address each of the
     Critical Operational Issues (COIs), the system’s operational effectiveness and suitability,
     additional information on operational capabilities, and include an assessment of
     operational mission impacts. These reports must strike the proper balance between
     system capabilities and limitations while taking into account how well the system
     performed mission essential tasks. As needed, a production or fielding recommendation
     will be included for Operational Assessment (OA), Operational Utility Evaluation
     (OUE), and FDE final reports. All Category I Deficiency Reports (DR) and the top 10
     Category II DRs will be listed.
 10                                                            AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


1.6. ICBM Test Forecast. The annual ICBM Test Forecast includes the mission identifier,
effected unit, test remarks, test timelines and key test dates for all ICBM OT&E.

       June meeting. Units and test ranges will be given 20 days to coordinate and provide
       comment.
       1.6.2.2. Following the December scheduling meeting, HQ AFGSC/A3IT will distribute,
       if required, a revision to the 1 October fiscal year schedule. 576 FLTS will provide
       inputs for the revision. Units and test ranges will be given 20 days for coordination and
       comment following the December meeting. If additional revisions are required, HQ
       AFGSC/A3IT will provide inputs and 10 days will be given for coordination and
       comment.
   1.6.3. HQ AFGSC/A3I, in consultation with 576 FLTS/CC, may approve changes to the
   approved test schedule. The distribution of the changes will be identical to the original
   approved schedule.
   1.6.4. Failure to comment by the specified dates above indicates concurrence with the
   proposed test forecast/changes.
1.7. Test Team Training. Training will be accomplished for all operational testing.
   1.7.1. 576 FLTS develops a training program consisting of proficiency and certification
   training:
       1.7.1.1. Proficiency Training.     Proficiency training includes initial training and
       supplemental training. It is administered to all test team personnel.
       1.7.1.2. Certification Training. Certification training includes test team certification
       training and mission director/commander training.
       1.7.1.3. Test-specific training requirements will be tailored to meet test objectives as
       outlined by the test requestor.
1.8. Test Team Certification. Test teams will be certified prior to accomplishing any
operational test. Medical certification is not required. Furthermore, 576 FLTS test teams do not
maintain continual certification for test team positions; positional certification ceases upon test
completion or cancellation.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                      11


   1.8.1. 576 FLTS/OGV develops evaluation materials, conducts test team evaluations for all
   OT&E and recommends test team certification to the 576 FLTS/CC.
1.9. Mission Certification (MC). Mission certification processes must be developed and
employed to identify and mitigate risks associated with ICBM OT&E.
   1.9.1. AFGSC/A3I ensures a MC process is applied to all operational testing.
   1.9.2. 576 FLTS develops the MC process to identify associated risks and certifies readiness
   prior to test execution.
   1.9.3. The MC process culminates with certification statements at test readiness reviews.
1.10. Test Readiness Review Board. The TRRB is a meeting to determine the readiness to
conduct a particular test. TRRBs are conducted at the HQ level, as applicable. AFGSC/A3IT
facilitates all TRRBs, reviews briefings and coordinates required organizations' attendance for
the TRRB for all tests. With the exception of SELM, TRRBs will take place no less than 5 days,
but no sooner than 2 weeks prior to the start of the test. For SELM, TRRBs will occur 1 day
prior to test execution. HQ AFGSC/A3 schedule requests are due for coordination to
HQ AFGSC/A3IT NLT 30 days prior to the requested TRRB date. Final, read-ahead slides are
due to A3IT for coordination NLT 1 week prior to TRRB.
   1.10.1. TRRBs will be chaired as follows:
   1.10.1.1. HQ AFGSC/A3, or designated representative will chair all TRRBs for AFGSC-
   directed tests.
       1.10.1.2. A poll will be conducted at the end of the briefing. The following offices (or
       their designated representative) will give a ―Go/No-Go‖ recommendation to HQ
       AFGSC/A3 for applicable tests (in this order): 576 FLTS/CC, HQ AFGSC/SE, 20
       AF/CC, and AFNWC/CC. Additional offices may be added for participation as needed
       (e.g. Parent Wing/CC for SELM, TF Parent Wing/CC for OTL, 625 STOS/CC for tests
       involving the ALCS, etc.). Readiness recommendations are made in accordance with
       (IAW) Table 1.1. 576 FLTS/CC or designated representative will state overall readiness
       to HQ AFGSC/A3. HQ AFGSC/A3 (or the designated representative) will then make the
       final ―go/no-go‖ decision.
   1.10.2. Table 1.1 outlines the organizations who will certify readiness to HQ AFGSC/A3.
   Each organization certifies readiness on behalf of all applicable sub-organizations in the
   responsible chain of command that are participating in the OT&E.

          2.2.12.4.5. Provide a representative in the ILSC when available.‖
   2.2.13. HQ AFGSC/A4M will:
      2.2.13.1. Immediately review and track all CRRs for applicable actions regarding the
      deployed force. Consider fleet-wide inspections, technical data changes, waivers, etc.
      Interface with the AFNWC/NWI as appropriate to accomplish any and all actions deemed
      necessary. Ensure CRRs, waiver requests, or other actions involving ICBM components
      are tracked to closure.
2.3. OTL Selection Procedures:
   2.3.1. Selection Process. HQ AFGSC/A3 selects a missile and associated LF components
   from a representative sample of the deployed force. HQ AFGSC/A3IT will solicit inputs
   from HQ AFGSC/A3IN/A4MI/A4MW, 20 AF/A3N/A4, TF Parent Wing, AFNWC/NWIEI
   and USSTRATCOM/J38 and JFCC-GS prior to final sortie selection. Sortie selection will be
   accomplished based on a two-year review of all OTL test objectives taking into account the
   booster, propulsion system rocket engine (PSRE) configuration, RV configuration, wing
   rotation and other factors as deemed necessary by HQ AFGSC/A3.
      2.3.1.1. HQ AFGSC/A3 will select the sortie 45 days prior to the first day of the month
      in which the sortie is to be removed from alert. This normally translates to approximately
      180 days prior to launch. The applicable unit must have HQ AFGSC/A3 and
      USSTRATCOM/J38 approval prior to taking the sortie off alert for removal.
      2.3.1.2. HQ AFGSC/A3 will issue a Sortie Selection Letter identifying the LF containing
      the missile selected for the flight test.
      2.3.1.3. 576 FLTS will contact the MW from which the OTL missile was selected and
      determine:
26                                                          AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


         2.3.1.3.1. The selected sortie’s on-alert status has not changed since selection and
         that there are no issues such as weather, maintenance, impassable roads, inoperative
         primary access hatch, etc. that would prevent a successful missile removal.
  2.3.2. The operational wing will not perform maintenance solely to ensure a successful alert
  readiness test (ART). After completion of the ART, only normal LF weapon system
  maintenance (e.g., LF faults for which MMOC T.O. fault flow directs maintenance to be
  performed) will be accomplished. After the ART, 576 FLTS must review all scheduled
  maintenance actions prior to being performed. 576 FLTS will make the final determination
  regarding authorized maintenance at the selected sortie. Deviating from this procedure could
  invalidate the test results for the selected sortie and result in a new sortie selection.
  2.3.3. During disassembly, inspection, test and re-assembly, report any defects that exceed
  allowable criteria to AFNWC/NWIEI and forward copies of discrepancies to 576 FLTS,
  20 AF/A4 and OTL TM. If at any time from selection through launch a component is
  identified as non-representative or non-flight worthy, AFNWC/NWIEI will provide an
  accounting of similar configured components in the deployed force. Engineering managers
  will then provide the expected impact on flights and any plans currently underway to remove
  items in question from the deployed force. After 576 FLTS and 20AF/A4 have reviewed the
  information, 576 FLTS and 20AF/A4 will determine if the defect is non-representative or
  non-flight worthy.
     2.3.3.1. Operationally representative or non-representative. A component is considered
     operationally representative if it exemplifies or typifies other components in the deployed
     force. If a component is found to have a defect, 576 FLTS/CC in coordination with 20
     AF/A4 will determine if the component is representative. If the components are being
     removed from the deployed force on a priority basis and all such components will be
     removed from the field prior to the next projected planning factor update, HQ
     AFGSC/A3 must approve selection of another component. However, if the configuration
     will remain in the deployed force indefinitely, HQ AFGSC/A3 must consider the
     configuration representative and proceed with launch.
     2.3.3.2. Non-flight worthy. A component is considered non-flight worthy if that
     component is known or suspected to fail, thus preventing the missile from completing its
     OTL mission. If components are considered non-flight worthy and non-repairable,
     576 FLTS will coordinate with AFNWC/NWIEI, 20 AF/A4 and HQ AFGSC/A3 for
     disposition of the component and recommend another component for HQ AFGSC/A3
     approval. AFNWC/NWIEI will provide recommendations (e.g., ground testing or depot-
     level testing) to 576 FLTS concerning the non-flight worthy component. The following
     conditions shall be reported as described in the final performance report. If the
     component fails ground testing or evaluation indicates it would not have supported a
     successful flight, it will be declared a representative failure. If the component passes
     ground testing, or engineering evaluation indicates it would have supported a successful
     flight, it will be declared a no-test since a ground test or engineering evaluation cannot
     completely replicate flight conditions. When a component is scored a no-test, its
     replacement will be used to score the flight. If a component is deemed flight worthy but
     AFNWC/NWIEI wants to subject the component to depot-level testing, they will convey
     their request via letter to 576 FLTS. 576 FLTS will forward this request through 20 AF
     to HQ AFGSC/A3 for a decision regarding the component.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                       27


2.4. Flight Test Planning Meeting (FTPM). FTPM is normally conducted by
HQ AFGSC/A3IT and hosted by the OTO approximately 90 days before launch. The primary
purpose of the FTPM is to review the range sensor support plans to meet mission objectives. A
FTPM is required for each launch; however, a FTPM may not be required for a second launch
attempt unless there are numerous factors that have changed between the two launch dates.
2.5. Part I - Alert Readiness Test:
   2.5.1. This part verifies the alert readiness condition of a selected missile by exercising
   launch critical components through automatic weapon system tests. When notified of missile
   selection, the operational unit will not perform maintenance, modification or inspections to
   the selected missile before Part I tests. Accomplish Part I tests on the selected sortie as soon
   as possible after selection notification. If the selected missile fails any one of these tests,
   consider this portion of the exercise a failure and notify 576 FLTS and 20 AF. Every effort
   will be made to ensure there is no extended delay between Part I testing and removal from
   alert. If a delay is required for any reason, the operational unit will immediately notify 576
   FLTS.
       2.5.1.1. 576 FLTS will notify operational unit MMOC by telephone of the missile
       selected and give authority to begin Part I. Notification will allow the affected
       operational unit to perform Part I tests and dispatch maintenance personnel. The sortie
       will not be removed from alert until directed by a JPIC. 576 FLTS will notify
       USSTRATCOM/J38, 20 AF and the OTL TM of the missile selected. 576 FLTS will
       request a backup guidance set as required.
   2.5.2. The following Part I tests, combined with normal monitoring of "No-Go" parameters,
   check most functions which would prevent a launch if a malfunction occurred. These tests
   provide weapon system alert readiness, operational countdown reliability data, and provide
   the maximum possible launch evaluation of the selected launch facility and missile.
       2.5.2.1. Sensitive command network test (SCNT).
       2.5.2.2. Missile Test.
       2.5.2.3. Enable test.
   2.5.3. If a missile fails to successfully complete Part I and the failure was caused by
   operational ground equipment malfunctions, correct the malfunction and continue. If the
   missile performs satisfactorily, process it for shipment to VAFB. If the failure was caused by
   aerospace vehicle equipment malfunction, correct the malfunction and return the missile to
   alert. AFGSC/A3 will select another missile. In either case, report to 576 FLTS and OTL
   TM as a Part I failure.
   2.5.4. Perform the following guidance assessment calibrations (2 hours after completion of
   Part I tests).
       2.5.4.1. Phi Calibration.
       2.5.4.2. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Calibration, Segment 1.
       2.5.4.3. IMU Calibration, Segment 2.
       2.5.4.4. Perturbation self-alignment technique calibration (commonly known as SAT
       CAL).
 28                                                           AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


      2.5.5. If an on-alert backup guidance set is selected, conduct Part I tests on the missile
      immediately.
   2.5.6. Before removing the sortie from alert, obtain missile guidance set (MGS)-peculiar
   gyro data numbers by accomplishing GENERATE STACK for a target case assigned to the
   selected MGS and viewing the number on the Target/Execution Plan Case Generation
   Summary Report. Provide gyro data numbers to 576 FLTS and include in the OTL Sortie
   Status Report (see Attachment 2).
   2.5.7. If a deficiency is discovered during Part I that would have prevented launch,
   immediately notify 576 FLTS. If this deficiency was caused by personnel or procedural error
   and applicable components perform satisfactorily, continue the mission. If this deficiency
   was caused by a hardware malfunction, correct it and return the missile to alert. AFGSC/A3
   will select another missile. In either situation report a Part I failure to 576 FLTS and OTL
   TM.
   2.5.8. If a missile stage, missile stage component, or RS malfunctions or is damaged after
   Part I, notify 576 FLTS and OTL TM. Coordinate with 576 FLTS and OTL TM as necessary
   to determine if repairs can be made in a timely manner and where repairs must be made. If
   normal field-level repair can clear discrepancies, proceed with necessary repairs after 576
   FLTS coordination. If a discrepancy requires depot-level maintenance, AFGSC/A3 may
   terminate the mission and select another missile or missile component.
   2.5.9. Capture "Depot IMU data."
2.6. Part II - Missile Removal and Transfer:
   2.6.1. Part II consists of missile, guidance set, RS and certain other LF hardware removal,
   component processing at the operational unit, shipment, receipt at VAFB and installation and
   checkout of range safety equipment. 576 FLTS may direct replacement components in the
   TEO. After Part I has been successfully completed, the operational unit must:
   2.6.2. Remove the missile from alert. Ensure the JPIC is received from JFCC/GS-J515 (Air
   Room) for L-Cat status or 625 STOS/OSK for F-Cat status prior to removal from alert.
   2.6.3. Remove LF ordnance directed by the TEO for shipment to VAFB unless otherwise
   directed by the TEO.
   2.6.4. Remove the guidance set and RS. Inspect the MGS to determine if a plate cover has
   been installed in place of the MGS optical window. If a plate cover is installed, notify the
   OTL TM and include this in the GLORY TRIP Status Report. Personnel from 576 FLTS
   will replace the plate cover with an MGS window, if required.
   2.6.5. Conduct a visual inspection to determine overall condition of the RS. Conduct all
   Reentry System Test Set initial build tests and inspections in reverse order as RS disassembly
   is being conducted. Provide all test tapes and associate them with applicable components or
   hardware. Inspect and test all Electro Explosive Devices (documented resistance
   measurements are required). Exact reassembly of the RS as it was configured on-site is
   paramount. Record and catalog all hardware associated with each specific RV and
   configuration of the payload. Segregate attaching hardware into separate bags per RV or
   payload. Prepare components for shipment IAW procedures stated in applicable T.O.s and
   this instruction.
   2.6.6. Notify the OTL TM of component serial numbers within 48 hours of missile removal.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                   29


  2.6.7. Prepare the missile stages, RS components, guidance set, and LF ordnance for
  shipment to VAFB IAW procedures stated in applicable T.O.s and this instruction.
  2.6.8. Discrepancy Reporting.
     2.6.8.1. During RS/RV processing, immediately report all discrepancies noted during
     inspections or tests to 576 FLTS, 798 MUMG/CC, OTL TM, HQ AFGSC/A4MW, the
     ICBM Flight Test Engineer (AFNWC/NWIEI) and RS/RV Engineer (AFNWC/NWI).
     2.6.8.2. Report Joint Test Assembly (JTA) discrepancies in accordance with T.O. 11N-5-
     1, Unsatisfactory Reports, as applicable. Closing summary by Defense Threat Reduction
     Agency (DTRA) will constitute final closure action.
     2.6.8.3. Report other RS/RV discrepancies in accordance with AFI 91-204, Safety
     Investigations and Reports, as appropriate.       Additionally, report VAFB-specific
     component discrepancies (i.e. instrumentation, antennas, etc.) in accordance with T.O.
     00-35D-54, USAF Materiel Deficiency Reporting Investigation and Resolution, as
     appropriate. Closing summary by DTRA will constitute final closure action for DOE
     assets.
     2.6.8.4. Following assessment of the deficiency (scope, mission impact, etc.), additional
     actions may be necessary. Several options are: component replacement request, flight
     worthiness assessment, T.O. waiver, or reselection.
     2.6.8.5. Discrepancies which may have significant likelihood of causing mission failure
     require termination of the event and selection of another missile or RS.
     2.6.8.6. Less severe discrepancies could result in component replacement action and
     continuation of the exercise. In either case, AFNWC/NWIEI will provide the unit
     shipping instructions so suspect components can undergo additional testing and
     inspection.
     2.6.8.7. 576 FLTS will request a complete engineering evaluation (verification of failure,
     identification of the cause, and mission impact assessment) from AFNWC/NWIEI. The
     engineering manager will forward results under separate cover to:
     HQ AFGSC/A3IT/A3IN/A4MW, 20 AF/A4, 798 MUMG Det 1 (for munitions-related
     evaluations), and 576 FLTS.
     2.6.8.8. In certain other circumstances, suspect components may require T.O. waivers to
     allow these components to continue on the mission and facilitate accurate assessment
     under actual launch conditions. 576 FLTS/CC or designated representative, after
     coordination with HQ AFGSC/A3IT/A4MW, 20 AF/A4M and applicable engineering
     managers will make the decision to pursue this latter course of action.

   2.8.1. This part consists of alert readiness, countdown, launch, flight, and post-mission data
   evaluation.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                        31


  2.8.2. The MCC will accomplish weapon system tests and commands including calibrations
  IAW applicable T.O. procedures. 576 FLTS MMOC will provide directions to accomplish
  tests and commands IAW T.O. procedures. Except as needed in support of required
  Operations Directives or post maintenance, the Safety Control Switch (SCS) key and plug
  will remain installed in the main LF distribution box from startup until all LF final enable
  procedures are accomplished and the LF is ready to be secured for launch.
     2.8.2.1. 576 FLTS MMOC will provide the TF Parent Wing MMOC with a daily update
     on all status changes, commands/tests run, and maintenance actions taken at the LF.
  2.8.3. The TEO will specify the date to attain alert ready status. Alert readiness begins at the
  completion of start-up, targeting, and associated testing (missile test, enable test, and required
  remote data change actions).
  2.8.4. Unless directed by T.O. or other directive, once an OTL missile has achieved alert
  readiness, it will not be removed from alert status without prior coordination with
  576 FLTS MMOC and TM, and permission granted by 576 FLTS/CC.
  2.8.5. TF and 576 FLTS must coordinate LF close out for launch procedures. To evaluate
  LF/missile systems in a completely launch ready condition, 576 FLTS must perform system
  checks to verify operation of test unique equipment.
  2.8.6. For ALCS launches, 625 STOS will coordinate an airborne test to verify voice
  communications circuits and ensure the ability of the missile to process ALCS commands.
  This test is conducted prior to the launch date.
  2.8.7. Prior to the start of launch countdown, 576 FLTS Mission Director will conference
  with the LDA for permission to proceed with countdown and missile launch.
  2.8.8. Contingencies:
     2.8.8.1. If a missile (e.g. booster, MGS, post boost vehicle, RS/RV, etc.) fails during
     alert and requires field-level maintenance or depot-level maintenance that can be
     performed at VAFB, immediately notify the OTL TM, make necessary repairs by either
     TF or depot personnel as appropriate, and proceed with the test. Use a backup guidance
     set                         as                       directed                        by
     HQ AFGSC/A3, if required. 576 FLTS will notify HQ AFGSC/A3IT.
     2.8.8.2. If a missile fails during alert and requires depot-level maintenance that can only
     be done at depot, immediately notify the OTL TM and suspend mission activities. 576
     FLTS will coordinate with HQ AFGSC/A3IT/A4M and provide direction to accomplish
     repairs or request HQ AFGSC/A3 select another missile.
     2.8.8.3. If a missile or subsystem failure results in a countdown abort and requires
     normal field-level or depot-level maintenance that can be performed at VAFB, score it as
     a countdown failure, make repairs, and proceed with the mission.
     2.8.8.4. If a missile failure during countdown requires depot-level repairs at the depot,
     report on it in the final Performance Report as a countdown failure. 576 FLTS may
     terminate the mission and HQ AFGSC/A3 will select another missile.
     2.8.8.5. If test-specific support equipment failure during countdown results in an abort,
     document the failure, correct the malfunction, and proceed with OTL activities. The
     mission will be considered a success if the flight is nominal.
32                                                          AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


     2.8.8.6. If an instrumentation wafer malfunctions and requires removal, the replacement
     wafer will be mated to the primary MGS. MGS changes will not be made to facilitate
     instrumentation wafer changes without HQ AFGSC/A3 approval.
     2.8.8.7. When any of the following conditions exist, 576 FLTS or HQ AFGSC/A3IT
     may add a suffix to the GLORY TRIP identifier (e.g., GLORY TRIP 200GM-1) prior to
     continuing the mission:
        2.8.8.7.1. A failure or policy direction results in selection of another missile or major
        missile component (including using a backup guidance set after successful initial
        start-up).
        2.8.8.7.2. If a missile failure results in countdown failure/abort or launch
        failure/abort.
        2.8.8.7.3. The mission is postponed from the original date identified in the TEO.
  2.8.9. Launch Readiness Review:
     2.8.9.1. The LRR is conducted to ensure test success, launch timeliness and safety of
     operations for ICBM launches. This formal review is the decision forum to examine
     readiness to proceed.
     2.8.9.2. Launch Readiness Reviews are chaired by the LDA.
  2.8.10. Launch Analysis Group:
     2.8.10.1. The purpose of the LAG is to determine the root cause of a mission anomaly
     and interpret data. The LAG will be comprised of, but not limited to, the following:
     576 FLTS/TEMA, 30 SW/SE representative, AFNWC/NWI representative, Northrop
     Grumman/Vandenberg and Northrop Grumman/Space Park. The NNSA and its
     associated laboratories and the Western Range and its associated contractors may also be
     a part of the LAG composition. For anomalies, the LAG may obtain additional expertise
     as necessary for the investigation.
     2.8.10.2. In the case of a mishap, the LAG will provide and interpret the telemetry data
     and/or any other data to both the safety and accident investigation board President
     (Reference AFI 91 204_AFGSCSUP and AFMAN 91-221_AFGSCSUP for further
     guidance).
 2.8.11. Forming the LAG:
     2.8.11.1. Following an anomaly, HQ AFGSC/A3I/SEW will determine if a LAG is
     required. If a LAG is deemed necessary, 576 FLTS/CC will appoint, in writing, a LAG
     chairperson. At any time during the LAG investigation, if the anomaly is determined to
     have force-wide impact, then AFGSC/CC will appoint a new LAG chairperson. The
     chairperson will be appointed from a pool of officers with ICBM test experience. If at
     any point the anomaly is deemed a mishap, transition to AFI 91-204_AFGSCSUP and
     AFMAN 91-221_AFGSCSUP to determine mishap investigation and reporting
     requirements.
     2.8.11.2. LAG investigations include, but are not limited to, determination of launch
     hangfire causes, aborts, missile/instrumentation failures and other anomalies that occur
     after the first launch vote is issued. Throughout the LAG process, AFGSC/A3 and/or
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                   33


     HQ AFGSC/SE may provide additional guidance. AFGSC/CC will release the final
     LAG report for an anomaly.
     2.8.11.3. Classification for investigation data, data products and reports will be made in
     accordance with the ICBM SCG.
     2.8.11.4. 576 FLTS will manage and control investigations and/or correction of test-
     unique equipment or weapon system malfunctions occurring after acceptance of the
     second execute launch command.
     2.8.11.5. A Launch Anomaly Response Team (LART) will be formed in the event of an
     abort, hangfire, or premature termination to determine the circumstances surrounding the
     condition. The LART will perform the procedures required to return the LF to a safe
     condition.
     2.8.11.6. The LAG will use telemetry data products, weapon system status indications
     and printouts, missile combat crew logs, training records (576 FLTS only), weapon
     system build records, launch telemetry data, launcher environmental protective system
     and any other form of data product relevant to the investigation. The LAG can also
     utilize personnel interviews as long as there is not a Safety Investigation Board or
     Accident Investigation Board in progress.
     2.8.11.7. 2 ROPS/DOF will ―impound‖ or ―impound with caveat‖ all range data, as
     directed by the LAG chairperson. If impound with caveat is used, the range will produce
     and release data as directed by the LAG chairperson. 2 ROPS/DOF will maintain all
     original raw data and data products. Copies of data will be provided to the LAG, as
     required, to facilitate investigation. The LAG will coordinate range data requests with
     HQ AFGSC/A3IT. All data will be retained for a minimum of 2 years. HQ AFGSC/A3,
     in conjunction with HQ AFGSC/SE, will determine data disposition after 2 years.
     2.8.11.8. When a LAG investigation is convened, HQ AFGSC/A3I will determine
     whether or not the TF may depart from VAFB to their home unit. HQ AFGSC/A3I will
     coordinate the release of the TF with the LAG chairperson.
     2.8.11.9. The LAG Chairperson will provide status reports. AFI 91-204_AFGSCSUP
     may be used as the template.         Status reports will be provided to HQ
     AFGSC/A3/A3I/A3IT/A3IN/A4/ A4M/A4MW/SE/SEW with info copies to HQ
     AF/A10O, HQ AFGSC/A5M/A4MI and 576 FLTS/CC. Status reports will be published
     weekly. AFGSC/A3 will determine distribution to USSTRATCOM/J38 and JFCC
     GS/J3/J31, HQ AF/A10N/A10R and 20 AF/A3/A4/SE.
     2.8.11.10. At a minimum, the investigation will provide an engineering analysis report
     and summary that includes findings, causes, and recommended corrective actions.
     AFNWC/NWI and contractors may be required to provide technical expertise in
     investigating these incidents.     Send final status message and reports to
     HQ AFGSC/A3/A3I/A3IT/A3IN/A4M/A4MW, and 576 FLTS/CC with info copies to

       2.8.11.12. HQ AFGSC/A3IN will determine ICBM force impact and HQ AFGSC/SEW
       will determine high accident potential requirements.
       2.8.11.13. OTL LAG Report. A LAG Report is required whenever there is an identified
       missile anomaly. An initial message is required within 8-hours after mishap. Weekly
       LAG status messages will be provided to all required addresses for the final LAG Report.
       Use AFI 91-204, AFI 91-204_AFGSCSUP and AFMAN 91-221_AFGSCSUP as
       guidelines to accomplish reporting, as information becomes available. Transmit follow-
       up reports with a routine precedence. The LAG will prepare a final LAG Report when an
       investigation is complete.
   2.8.12. Test asset recovery actions:
       2.8.12.1. The Memorandum of Understanding between the National Nuclear Security
       Administration (NNSA) and the Department of the Air Force Regarding Joint Testing and
       Assessment of the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile will serve as the basis for recovery of test
       assets.
2.9. Maintenance Procedures: Credibility of the AFGSC flight test program depends largely
on the control and safe transfer of missile components from an operational unit LF to the VAFB
LF. The operational unit and 576 FLTS will augment these procedures, as required, to ensure
OTL components are properly documented, controlled, and handled during all phases of an OTL.
   2.9.1. Missile Wings (90 MW, 91 MW, and 341 MW) will:
       2.9.1.1. Expedite the shipment of all missile components, as identified or as amended by
       the TEO, to VAFB for OT. QA will inspect all OTL components prior to shipping. If
       damage is identified during inspections, QA will provide inputs to the unit for preparation
       of an OTL Component Damage Report on all damaged components found (See
       Attachment 4).
       2.9.1.2. Appoint an OTL maintenance Non Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC)
       to monitor all shipping procedures from the operational unit. The representative must
       ensure all missile and LF component part numbers and serial numbers agree with those
       taken from selected sortie/sites and they are properly marked for shipment. Maintain
       constant contact with OTL TM and OTL planner.
       2.9.1.3. Ensure no component of an OTL missile leaves a LF or maintenance facility
       without the OTL identifier prominently marked on it, and no component is released for
       packing and crating without specific guidance regarding how and where the container
       will be marked.
       2.9.1.4. Remove and obliterate old markings from container to avoid losing small
       components and simplify Traffic Management Office (TMO) monitoring.
       2.9.1.5. Ensure the proper VAFB FB or FV account is properly annotated on containers
       and fully documented.
       2.9.1.6. Mark pallets "DO NOT SEPARATE."
       2.9.1.7. Direct TMO to block space to final destination to ensure en-route stations do not
       separate or break up pallets.
       2.9.1.8. Mark all containers and documentation with Emergency and Special Program
       (ESP) Code 7V. ESP Code 7V is used to help identify a ballistic missile OTL conducted
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                     35


      IAW this instruction. Strict compliance with container markings and documentation with
      ESP CODE 7V ensures the wing is ultimately reimbursed for OTL movement charges.
      Wings are expected to budget for and ship components during OTL activities. Upon
      receipt, 576 FLTS will forward applicable information to HQ AFGSC/A5R for
      determination of unit reimbursement for OTL shipping charges, as required.
      2.9.1.9. Use signature service on each shipment of OTL components to provide positive
      control throughout the shipping process.
      2.9.1.10. Send shipping notification by priority message to all appropriate agencies.
      2.9.1.11. TMO will initiate a report of shipment (REPSHIP) to en-route and VAFB
      TMOs to ensure the shipment has been sent. Transmit REPSHIP by message within 2
      hours after the shipment departs the originating system.
   2.9.2. 576 FLTS will:
      2.9.2.1. Through TMO (scheduling), acknowledge receipt of shipment by message
      within 24 hours of arrival.
      2.9.2.2. Identify appropriate equipment storage areas by OTL mission designator.
      2.9.2.3. Upon receipt of unit shipping notifications, establish close coordination with
      VAFB Central Receiving and appropriate agencies to monitor arrival of components,
      suspense all inbound shipments and follow-up with TMO on shipments not received by
      the established due date to include the initiation of tracer actions.
      2.9.2.4. Process issue transactions for repair cycle assets to be expensed or consumed
      when the OTL mission concludes using demand code "K." This will preclude
      establishing due in for maintenance details and the need for initial issue authorization.
2.10. Movement Procedures: Strict compliance with the marking, handling, and notification
instructions are mandatory to protect the integrity of operational test concepts.
   2.10.1. Missile Stage(s) Movement Procedures:
      2.10.1.1. Based on established movement dates, AFNWC/NWI, in coordination with the
      local TMO, will arrange transportation between the operational unit and VAFB.
      20AF/A4M will assist as requested to ensure a coordinated effort between the operational
      unit and AFNWC/NWI for all missile movements.

flight through impact. Transmit all unclassified and classified messages for GLORY TRIP
missions via Defense Messaging Service and/or appropriate level email. For copies sent to email
addresses, send document in Acrobat PDF format.
   2.13.1. OTL Sortie Status Report (Attachment 2). The unit is responsible for reporting OTL
   status and schedule changes. The unit must prepare an initial report at the completion of Part
   I. Updates to the initial report are required after Part II and if schedule changes occur. Send
   report(s) to 576 FLTS OTL TM and 576 FLTS/TMOS within 5 days of completion of each
   part and immediately upon schedule changes.

   2.13.3. OTL Component Damage Report (Attachment 4). The unit will report any damaged
   or defective components discovered during the OTL process within 5 days of occurrence.
   This includes any components (e.g. RV body sections) damaged or defective but not sent to
   PANTEX or VAFB.
   2.13.4. OTL Mission and Preliminary Scoring Report (Attachment 5). This report is the first
   transmission of information on results of a GLORY TRIP operation. The OTO will issue the
   report using routine precedence, NLT 8 hours following the launch. If a mission results in an
   abort or a flight anomaly with no score provided by downrange sensors, issue the report
   within 6 hours of abort/anomaly and transmit using immediate precedence. The report will
   provide background information for nominal missions. For other than nominal missions,
   report the fact there was a failure and if destruct commands were/were not issued. Only
   addressees with a need-to-know will be informed of failure modes through applicable
   messages and reports. Required safety reports will be accomplished through the appropriate
   safety channels.
   2.13.5. OTL Final Scoring Report (Attachment 6). The OTO will issue final RV scores using
   this report for a nominal missile NLT launch +7 days for a KMISS only scored mission or
   radar only scored mission, or launch +14 days for a launch involving the LIDSS.

     at a minimum an executive summary, POC listing, and content consistent with guidance in
     AFI 99-103 and as tailored to the objectives of the test, and the decision makers' needs for
     information about system effectiveness and suitability.           Upon request from HQ
     AFGSC/A3I/A3IT, any required edits will be made and the updated report submitted back to
     HQ AFGSC/A3IT within 48 hours.
        2.13.6.1. TF/CC, 576 FLTS LD, AFNWC/NWI, and OTL contractor support personnel
        will provide inputs for each performance report to the OTL test manager.
  2.13.7. To be an effective measure of operational capabilities, OTL activities must be
  representative of the deployed force. Therefore, performance reports must contain comments
  on all events and actions during the entire mission that could affect operational realism for
  each test. This includes comments on procedures, personnel actions and missile system
  performance, as well as inputs from the operational unit TF.

      CDRUSSTRATCOM Emergency Action Procedures, Volume 12, Exercise Support
      Procedures.
   3.3.5. 14 weeks prior to test week, operations and maintenance training personnel should
   begin developing SELM operations and maintenance lesson plans based on WSSRs, SELM
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                      45


  T.O.s, the TEO, TP, TSD and this instruction. The TSM, TM, and AFNWC/NWI
  representative (maintenance only) will review and coordinate on the final lesson plans to
  ensure SELM test requirements are met.
  3.3.6. Approximately 8 weeks prior to test week, have an AFNWC/NWI representative and
  the SELM MTU, containing SELM test equipment arrive at the tasked wing. An
  AFNWC/NWI representative will provide an overview of SELM configuration and
  maintenance procedures to key unit training personnel. This overview in no way relieves
  unit personnel of their responsibility to develop and implement a training program based on
  appropriate technical data, safety rules and AFGSC directives. An AFNWC/NWI
  representative will also review maintenance lesson plans.
  3.3.7. Also approximately 8 weeks prior to test week, the TM will present a pretest briefing
  to the unit senior staff and SELM working group, outlining test objectives, dates and key
  personnel. 576 FLTS will accomplish a dry-run of the TSD at the SMIC prior to the pretest
  briefing.
  3.3.8. The TSM and appropriate members of the working group will develop a schedule for
  deposturing sorties for SELM testing, bringing them to SELM alert and returning them to
  alert after Part III. Six weeks prior to test week, the schedule will be sent to the TM and
  AFNWC/NWI. After TSM and TM approval of the deposture/reposture schedule,
  JFCC/GS515 (Air Room) will provide JPICs for L-Cat status sorties or 625 STOS/OSK will
  provide the necessary targeting materials for F-Cat status sorties before removing/returning
  sorties from/to alert. To minimize impact, USSTRATCOM may direct the sequence of sortie
  deposture/reposture. According to AFGSCI 10-901, Volume 1, Intercontinental Ballistic
  Missile (ICBM) Emergency War Order (EWO) Operations, sorties may not be depostured
  prior to the date set out in the JPIC. Sorties are also repostured according to information
  contained in the JPIC, usually NLT 19 calendar days after the final test day.
  3.3.9. The TM will arrive at the unit at least 4 weeks prior to test week and will have the
  TSD in final draft form upon arrival. The TSM and TM will finalize the TSD and distribute
  approved final copies at least 2 weeks prior to test week.
  3.3.10. Operational units will conduct training for all personnel involved in the SELM test.
  Training will include, but not be limited to, a thorough review of applicable provisions of this
  instruction, the SELM T.O., WSSRs, unit operations order, the TEO, special procedures for
  conducting the test, code component control requirements, test organization and
  management, missile procedures trainer orientation, and test complex configuration.
     3.3.10.1. Only certified MCCs will be selected and trained to support the SELM test.
     Lesson plans and training scripts will be developed based upon job performance
     requirements and tasks contained within the TSD. Units will coordinate training scripts
     with the TM and TC for proper presentation. Operations training will include
     supplemental lesson plans for SELM deposture and reposture. These lesson plans will be
     conducted daily at the unit pre-departure briefing during deposture and reposture phases.
     3.3.10.2. All maintenance personnel involved in the SELM test will meet AFI 21-202,
     Volumes 13, Missile Maintenance Management, training requirements. Maintenance
     teams performing special test procedures will be thoroughly trained and certified in test
     unique procedures.
46                                                          AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


     3.3.10.3. Specific training requirements for SELM personnel are outlined in this
     subsection.
         3.3.10.3.1. If possible, unit key personnel should observe a SELM test at another
         unit. This serves as familiarization and training on SELM test procedures. Personnel,
         if possible, may also observe a SELM test on board ALCS aircraft.
         3.3.10.3.2. Maintenance teams penetrating a SELM-configured LF for any reason
         except for emergency situations must be SELM trained.
         3.3.10.3.3. Train quick reaction maintenance (QRM) teams on site safing and
         emergency shutdown procedures. Place them on standby, in non-test squadrons,
         during Part III to ensure they are capable of responding to and safing any non-test LF
         exhibiting an unsafe condition.
         3.3.10.3.4. Train test evaluation teams (TET) on site safing and emergency shutdown
         procedures, quick look inspection procedures, SELM control monitor tape retrieval
         and proper site shutdown following simulated execution. Dispatch a TET on standby
         to each MAF in the test squadron and at ordnance sites during Part III.
         3.3.10.3.5. Train operations and maintenance personnel on duty in the test LCCs and
         LFs on test countdown operations, TSD use, reporting, anomaly procedures,
         emergency procedures, and code control requirements encountered during testing
         phases.
         3.3.10.3.6. Operations personnel on duty in non-test LCCs must be trained in test
         countdown operations, TSD use, reporting and emergency procedures.
         3.3.10.3.7. The AAT must receive training in anomaly investigation/analysis
         procedures prior to initiation of Part III activities.
  3.3.11. Units conducting a SELM test are AFGSC's "most knowledgeable resource" for
  identifying SELM T.O. deficiencies and ensuring SELM T.O.s are compatible with weapon
  system operations and maintenance technical data. In order to assure adequacy of SELM
  technical data, units will:
     3.3.11.1. Conduct a complete review of the SELM T.O. approximately 13 weeks prior to
     test week. Submit Urgent Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) 22s if changes are not
     needed until commencement of SELM posturing or Emergency AFTO 22s if changes are
     required prior to commencement of SELM posturing.
     3.3.11.2. Submit changes through normal channels. Provide information copies to
     20 AF/A3/A4, 576 FLTS, and AFNWC/NWIEI ―SELECT‖.
  3.3.12. Part I - Alert Readiness Test. Approximately 1 week prior to the start of scheduled
  SELM posture, the TM will verbally direct an ART to each test facility. These tests check
  most functions that would prevent launch if a malfunction occurred and provides a base-line
  evaluation of each facility and missile prior to maintenance activities for SELM posturing.
     3.3.12.1. Designated tests will be addressed to each test LF by the parent LCC and
     include:
     3.3.12.2. Sensitive Command Network Test.
     3.3.12.3. Missile Test.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                    47


     3.3.12.4. Enable Test.
     3.3.12.5. Inhibit Test and Computer Memory Verification Check.
     3.3.12.6. If a missile fails to successfully complete ART, correct malfunctions and re-
     accomplish ART.
     3.3.12.7. Retain a detailed record of each command and all system responses including
     appropriate printer tapes/crew logs for both normal and abnormal indications for
     inclusion in the final Performance Report.
     3.3.12.8. Within 24 hours of ART completion, submit a SELM Status Report
     (Attachment 10).
  3.3.13. Part II - SELM Posturing (Deposturing):
     3.3.13.1. SELM trained maintenance teams will configure test facilities for SELM as
     specified in the TEO, WSSRs and appropriate SELM T.O.s and TP by SELM trained
     maintenance teams. QA personnel must observe/verify all test LF/LCC deposture
     activities.
     3.3.13.2. Normal security procedures apply for all test facilities throughout the entire
     deposture, test and reposture period (reference AFGSCMAN 31-108GM331-108, ICBM
     Systems Security).
     3.3.13.3. Plans and Scheduling and MMOC must ensure all maintenance teams and team
     members dispatching to SELM LFs are SELM trained, SELM work orders are properly
     marked and maintenance discrepancies are not repaired just to ensure a successful test.
     3.3.13.4. The TSM and TM must review all scheduled maintenance actions prior to
     being performed at test LCCs and LFs. Deviating from this procedure could invalidate
     the test results for that LF or LCC. Wait until the test is complete to clear any LCC or LF
     discrepancies/deficiencies found during the test (clear during the reposture).
     3.3.13.5. Remove and return to base the RS at any LF where ordnance will be expended,
     only one LCC will be test-configured, or if a nuclear safety related anomaly occurs.
     3.3.13.6. Modify test LFs by installing SELM test equipment as required.            SELM
     qualified personnel will:
         3.3.13.6.1. Install RS/RV simulators.
         3.3.13.6.2. Accomplish isolation IAW the appropriate SELM T.O.
         3.3.13.6.3. Replace all critical component operational codes, except the secure data
         units and KS-60 cryptographic units, with test codes. LCCs, LFs, and ALCS are
         configured with EXCLUDED test codes.
         3.3.13.6.4. Install and configure Communication Equipment Interface Units (CEIU)
         to ensure Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) data is recorded from the
         test LFs as well as the operational LFs. Depending on where CEIUs are already
         installed and which LCCs are selected for test, it may be necessary to install a CEIU
         in an LCC supporting test LFs or an LCC supporting the operational LFs on the non-
         test side of the squadron. PADS settings must be adjusted prior to CEIU start up and
         shut down to allow for the configuration changes. Coordinate with the Boeing
48                                                           AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


        Guidance Representative to perform this function prior to any CEIU start up or shut
        down.
        3.3.13.6.5. Electrically isolate test LCCs and LFs from the remainder of the
        operational squadron.
        3.3.13.6.6. Verify electrical isolation using SELM T.O. and TSD isolation
        verification procedures.
        3.3.13.6.7. Install a lock pin assembly in the SCS after start-up in SELM
        configuration. Remove lock pin assembly in the SCS after Last Look Inspection is
        accomplished at each test LF. Install missile safing pins in the test missiles.
        3.3.13.6.8. Unit QA personnel will verify the proper configuration of each test site
        prior to MGS start-up.
        3.3.13.6.9. Target test missiles with normal target assignments/execution plans and
        bring to SELM alert.
     3.3.13.7. SELM test provides capabilities to activate or simulate activation of the
     following LF ordnance fired devices: launcher closure door, upper umbilical critical
     leads disconnect, guidance & control umbilical release and retract, MGS battery and
     missile suspension system articulating arms. Activation will occur at two sites each
     SELM. Simulate this event at all remaining test LFs.
     3.3.13.8. At least one launcher closure door every other year will be activated. When a
     launcher closure door is activated, the operational unit will construct an arresting barrier
     per SELM T.O. to restrain the launcher closure door at the activated LF. Simulate
     launcher closure door activation at all remaining test LFs.
     3.3.13.9. Critical leads disconnect, guidance and control umbilical release and retract and
     missile suspension articulating arms will normally be activated at two LFs per test and
     will be directed in the TEO. This event is simulated at all other test LFs.
     3.3.13.10. Do not expend MGS batteries on SELM tests unless special testing is
     required. Remove all MGS batteries. The portion of Terminal Countdown (TCD), which
     normally occurs on airborne power, will take place using a ground power source allowed
     by SELM MGS battery by-pass procedures. When actual activation of the MGS battery
     is directed by the TEO, remove expended MGS battery from the MGS, place it in an
     approved storage container, and await disposition instructions from 576 FLTS.
     3.3.13.11. Following MGS start-up in SELM configuration, secure each test facility.
     Conduct all maintenance at SELM alert test facilities by using appropriately trained
     SELM qualified maintenance teams. Teams dispatching to a SELM LF will pre-
     coordinate with the TSM or TM. If pre-coordination is not possible (e.g. a critical or
     emergency situation), notify the TSM or TM as soon as practical. If a non-SELM trained
     maintenance team dispatches to a SELM LF, then a SELM trained maintenance team
     must dispatch to the SELM LF to ensure proper completion of maintenance and proper
     SELM configuration.
     3.3.13.12. Submit a SELM Status Report (Attachment 10) within 24 hours after all test
     facilities are postured to SELM alert. An LF is on SELM alert when SELM equipment is
     installed, SELM codes are loaded, applicable post-maintenance is complete for the sortie
     to be called on alert, and a last look inspection is accomplished. An LCC is on SELM
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                    49


     alert when SELM codes are installed and Last Line Isolation and isolation verification are
     complete.
     3.3.13.13. Handle test LFs which are to operate on LF emergency power during SELM
     commit as follows:
        3.3.13.13.1. Place LFs designated in the TEO or TP in the LF emergency power
        mode IAW the appropriate SELM T.O.. Leave LFs on emergency power at least 15
        hours, but less than the T.O. 21M-LGM30F-102, Organizational Maintenance --
        Minuteman Operational Capabilities and Characteristics (Vandenberg AFB, Wing I-
        VI), system emergency survivability period. If T.O. 21M-LGM30F-102 emergency
        survivability period is less than 15 hours, immediately notify the unit TSM and TM.
        Do not allow LF to be left on emergency power in excess of the T.O. 21MLGM30F-
        102 system emergency survivability period for any reason. Do not test LFs on
        emergency power if previously on batteries for an extended period of time. During
        test activities, do not allow the batteries to discharge below T.O. limits.
        3.3.13.13.2. After the LF is placed on emergency power, accomplish an initial and
        then hourly storage battery output voltage check IAW appropriate SELM T.O.
        Additionally, accomplish a storage battery output voltage check just prior to
        execution and just after TCD. The TSD will contain necessary steps to verify the LF
        is on emergency power and for an on-site TET to report voltage readings at
        prescribed times.
     3.3.13.14. MCCs at test LCCs must continuously monitor the SELM ready status
     following Last Look Inspections through key-turn. Loss of SELM ready status requires
     immediate dispatch of SELM trained maintenance personnel to determine the cause.
     Loss of SELM ready status will be indicated by:
        3.3.13.14.1. Reset of Ground Maintenance Response (GMR) 15.
     3.3.13.15. Unit personnel will conduct a Last Look Inspection IAW applicable SELM
     T.O. and this instruction of each test LF (LCC will occur during Last Line Isolation) prior
     to the TRRB and Part III activities. A team composed of SELM qualified QA personnel,
     the SELM maintenance officer and/or other personnel designated by the unit commander
     will conduct this inspection.
        3.3.13.15.1. The purpose of this inspection is to verify:
            3.3.13.15.1.1. Proper connection of all SELM test equipment.
            3.3.13.15.1.2. Proper safing of applicable AVE.
            3.3.13.15.1.3. Proper installation of all SELM cables.
            3.3.13.15.1.4. Missile safing pins installed.
            3.3.13.15.1.5. Proper installation of isolators.
            3.3.13.15.1.6. Proper installation of RS/RVs (RS/RV removed or electrically
            disconnected from the MGS and mechanically mated to the SELM spacer) at the
            test LFs.
        3.3.13.15.2. The Last Look Inspection team will also verify command line removal at
        secondary test LCCs. If a maintenance team penetrates a test LF for any reason after
        Last Look Inspection, another Last Look Inspection must be accomplished.
50                                                           AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


     3.3.13.16. After a Last Look Inspection has been performed at a test LF, the Last Look
     Inspection team will seal the launch tube opening and I-Box with a signed/dated paper
     label. After a Last Look Inspection has been performed at a test LCC, the Last Look
     Inspection team will seal the I-Box with a signed/dated paper label. If a seal is not intact
     or has been tampered with, that portion of the Last Look Inspection will be re-
     accomplished.
     3.3.13.17. Upon completion of Part II and prior to Part III, the TSM will work with 576
     FLTS to conduct a TRRB IAW paragraph 1.10. This TRRB will serve as a certification
     to HQ AFGSC/A3 that all operational, logistical and safety requirements within
     instructions, TEO, SELM T.O., weapon system T.O.s and WSSRs have been complied
     with. After certifications, the unit commander and the TSM will sign a certification
     statement certifying the unit is ready to conduct the test. As a minimum, the following
     personnel or designated representative must verbally certify their respective actions are
     complete and are ready to conduct the test:
         3.3.13.17.1. TSM.
         3.3.13.17.2. TM.
         3.3.13.17.3. TC-A.
         3.3.13.17.4. Safety.
         3.3.13.17.5. Maintenance officer or person who actually accomplished Last Look
         Inspection.
         3.3.13.17.6. Weapons and Tactics Flight representative.
         3.3.13.17.7. Codes Flight representative.
         3.3.13.17.8. 576 FLTS/CC.
         3.3.13.17.9. Unit Operations Group/CC.
         3.3.13.17.10. Unit Maintenance Group/CC.
         3.3.13.17.11. 20 AF/A3 representative.
     3.3.13.18. Last Line Isolation and isolation verification are normally accomplished on
     the Friday prior to test week. Prior to Last Line Isolation, all SELM LCCs must be fully
     configured and LFs must be on SELM alert. After Last Line Isolation, ensure no test or
     non-test sorties in a test squadron (except as directed by the TSD) are in calibration
     (except for post-maintenance actions or TSD requirements).
  3.3.14. Part III - Launch Demonstration. Part III begins with the initiation of isolation
  verification on both airborne and ground days and ends with confirmation of successful
  terminal countdown by on-site maintenance TET using SELM equipment.
     3.3.14.1. Actual SELM testing is divided into separate airborne test and ground test
     phases.
         3.3.14.1.1. Typically, 50% of the test sorties will be incrementally simulated
         launched by MCCs from an ALCS on the first test day. On the second test day,
         MCCs in the LCCs will incrementally simulate the launch of remaining sorties. The
         third test day serves as a back-up for either airborne or ground test completion.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                   51


        3.3.14.1.2. All activities must be closely coordinated, timed, and controlled and will
        not be scheduled without prior coordination with the TM. Part III is designed to
        provide ground system reliability data points for planning. During SELM tests this
        process begins with the first critical command (hot time PLC, Enable, or Execute
        Launch command) and ends with TCD or last critical command for each test
        increment. Make maximum use of standard T.O.s and operating procedures to
        enhance operational realism. The TSD does not replace operational T.O.s.
     3.3.14.2. For SELM tests, sorties are scored only on the basis of launch reliability (LR).
     LR is a probability an ICBM will launch the first time directed. During SELM tests LR
     begins and ends with the first and last critical command (hot time PLC, Enable, or
     Execute Launch Command). This process begins with the first critical command and
     ends with TCD or last critical command for each test increment. SELM sorties will be
     scored using criteria in the SELM Reporting Section of this instruction.
     3.3.14.3. The TM will lead execution of the test countdown. The TSM, with
     concurrence from 576 FLTS and TM, has authority to delay and/or reschedule the test
     countdown when in their judgment:
        3.3.14.3.1. Nuclear, missile, or ground safety will be compromised.
        3.3.14.3.2. Test activities will interfere with the wing mission in support of
        Operational Plans (OPlan).
        3.3.14.3.3. The accomplishment of primary, secondary, or special test objectives is
        jeopardized.
     3.3.14.4. All decisions affecting a test countdown will come from the TSM, or will be
     passed to him/her from higher authority to be communicated to test elements concerned.
     TSMs will coordinate activities through the TM by means of the TSD. All actions having
     reference to the SELM T.O. will be mandatory, whether of a routine or emergency
     nature. Include in the TSD detailed instructions for emergency and/or "back out" actions
     to be performed in case certain contingencies other than those requiring specified
     mandatory responses are encountered.           The unit commander (or designated
     representative) and 576 FLTS/CC or designated representative, will confirm all decisions
     to hold, reschedule or continue the test.
     3.3.14.5. As specified in the TSD, safety, security forces, and other required personnel
     will be in position for immediate response to any contingency. Do not accomplish
     critical commands until all required teams are in their designated positions.
     3.3.14.6. At test LFs where ordnance activation is being simulated (all SELM Test Set
     Ordnance Activation switches in SIMULATE position), maintenance TET need not be
     present at the site during Part III. However, the unit must have sufficient TET teams on
     standby to retrieve SELM Test Set printouts from unmanned test LFs and conduct a
     Quick-Look inspection within 24 hours of TCD. Dispatch a TET on standby to each
     MAF in the test squadron. Place a TET at test LFs where ordnance is being activated
     (any SELM Test Set switches in the LIVE position). This team will be stationed topside
     or in the launcher equipment room at LFs where the launcher closure door is not being
     activated and maintain communication with the MCC. For LFs activating the launcher
     closure, TETs will ensure all personnel exit LF fenced areas and maintain site security
     from the LF access road. At ordnance sites, TETs will make a Quick-Look inspection of
52                                                           AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


     SELM test equipment and the test LF IAW SELM T.O.s to determine TCD success.
     Immediately report out of tolerance conditions either from SELM test set printouts or
     visual inspections of hardware (ordnance devices or weapon system hardware) to the
     TSM. Do not take further action, except in an emergency situation, until TSM direction
     is received.
     3.3.14.7. Dispatch one QRM team on standby to each non-test squadron on airborne test
     day. QRM teams must be trained on site safing and emergency shutdown procedures and
     capable of responding to and safing any non-test LF exhibiting an unsafe condition.
     3.3.14.8. Dispatch an Anomaly Analysis Management Team (AAMT), composed of a
     maintenance officer, technical engineer, and QA person to the primary test MAF. The
     AAMT must be trained on anomaly analysis procedures. Dispatch the AAMT to test
     facilities, as required, to assist in anomaly analysis.
     3.3.14.9. After isolation verification confirms that test missiles, all supporting personnel,
     equipment, and facilities are ready for execution, the TSM (with concurrence of the TM
     and 576 FLTS representative) will advise the unit commander and request permission to
     proceed with test activities.
     3.3.14.10. MCCs in the test LCC(s)/ALCS will accomplish enabling and commit as
     directed by the TM using the TSD.
     3.3.14.11. The TSM will remain in the Test Command Post to coordinate test activities,
     quick look analysis efforts, and direct various recovery activities. After simulated launch
     of an ordnance site, do not execute further increments until a quick look analysis for that
     ordnance site is complete. Additionally, quick look analysis will be accomplished at the
     end of each test day and any other time abnormal status indications warrant.
     3.3.14.12. During testing periods on airborne and ground test days, the following applies
     to facilities configured for SELM testing:
        3.3.14.12.1. Security forces will not conduct any security reaction exercises.
        3.3.14.12.2. Do not schedule any maintenance.
        3.3.14.12.3. Ensure no test or non-test sorties in a test squadron (except as directed
        by the TSD) are in calibration.
        3.3.14.12.4. Submit a SELM Terminal Countdown Report (Attachment 13) after
        airborne/ground test day is complete. This will serve as the test stop message for
        airborne/ground test days.
  3.3.15. Part IV – SELM Deposturing (Reposturing):
     3.3.15.1. Reposture test facilities to alert as specified in SELM and maintenance T.O.s.
     3.3.15.2. Return CEIUs to pre-test configurations. Coordinate with Boeing Guidance
     Representative to ensure correct CEIU and PADS settings prior to CEIU start up or shut
     down.
     3.3.15.3. Reposture test facilities to alert NLT date/time specified in TEO and JPICs.
     3.3.15.4. Return SELM test equipment to base where the unit will inspect and document
     equipment condition. Load SELM test equipment into the SELM MTU and ship as
     directed by AFNWC/NWIEI.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                 53


     3.3.15.5. After all test facilities are repostured to alert, submit a SELM Status Report
     (Attachment 10).
  3.3.16. Anomaly/Failure Analysis:
     3.3.16.1. Unless waived by the MW/CC or designated representative, immediately
     implement an anomaly/failure analysis for failure to achieve test objectives due to
     hardware/software anomalies, for countdown aborts or for significant anomalies
     occurring during Part III (SELM Launch Demonstration). 576 FLTS/CC and/or MW/CC
     may also implement an anomaly/failure analysis for significant anomalies occurring
     during Parts I, II and IV. SELM anomalies and the details of the investigation are
     classified IAW the ICBM SCG.
     3.3.16.2. The anomaly analysis required by this instruction will in no way infringe upon
     the requirements of or relieve responsibility for accident/incident investigation and
     reporting IAW AFI 91-204 and AFGSC alternate reporting guidelines.
     3.3.16.3. The MW/CC or designated representative is responsible for the investigation of
     any test objective failure, countdown abort, or significant anomaly. Assistance from the
     on-site AFNWC/NWIEI ―SELECT‖ is mandatory for investigation of Part III
     failures/anomalies. If required, request ―SELECT‖ assistance for Part I, II or IV
     anomalies.
     3.3.16.4. MW/CC or designated representative will chair an AAT conducting
     investigations. An AAT will consist of the following members or designated
     representatives plus any others MW/CC deems appropriate:
         3.3.16.4.1. SQ/CC.
         3.3.16.4.2. TSM.
         3.3.16.4.3. TM.
         3.3.16.4.4. Maintenance officer.
         3.3.16.4.5. ―SELECT‖ team.
         3.3.16.4.6. 576 FLTS/CC or designated representative.
         3.3.16.4.7. Wing missile safety officer.
         3.3.16.4.8. Chief, Technical Engineering Flight.
         3.3.16.4.9. Chief, Quality Assurance.
         3.3.16.4.10. Chief, Standardization/Evaluation.
         3.3.16.4.11. Chief, Operations Training.
         3.3.16.4.12. The AAMT (On-site maintenance officer and technical engineer).
     3.3.16.5. The anomaly analysis portion of SELM testing cannot be over emphasized.
     Integrity of the test site must be maintained and a thorough analysis/investigation made
     and reported. This is the only way deficiencies can be identified and corrected.
     3.3.16.6. Immediately report anomalies occurring during Part II to MW/CC. During the
     notification process, the TSM will also request permission to form the AAT.
54                                                            AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


     3.3.16.7. If the AAT is formed during Part III, the TSM and/or TM will ensure TET is
     standing by (manned LF) or will dispatch TET and AAMT to penetrate LF (unmanned
     LF). When an LF is penetrated, the TSM or TM will provide the team with preliminary
     instructions for emergency procedures, maintaining site integrity, and gathering status
     (Anomaly Analysis Section of TSD).
     3.3.16.8. Do not enter test LFs evacuated for safety reasons until approval for safe entry
     is declared according to provisions of the SELM T.O.s. Only personnel specifically
     assigned, approved, and trained to conduct failure analysis will be permitted entry into
     failed LFs.
     3.3.16.9. It is absolutely essential that all agencies make every effort to preserve integrity
     of the test LF or LCC configuration until such a time that disruptions will have minimal
     bearing on further investigation efforts. For example, if initial visual inspection of the LF
     and SELM equipment indicates any anomaly, do not safe the SCS to change any pre-
     launch configuration. Also, the SELM equipment will remain in the "on" condition and
     will not be reset.
     3.3.16.10. The AAT will form in the SELM test command post or some other location
     with access to the SELM countdown net and develop a preliminary investigation plan.
     This plan will include the following:
        3.3.16.10.1. Immediate actions required of the AAMT or TET.
        3.3.16.10.2. Guidance to SQ/CC and TSM as to whether the remaining portions of
        the test can be safely continued. Make every effort to process the remaining portions
        of Part III in a manner consistent with actions required for emergencies, personnel
        safety, WSSRs, and nuclear surety.
        3.3.16.10.3. A preliminary plan for maintaining/returning the site to a safe
        configuration and maintaining site integrity.
        3.3.16.10.4. An outline of on-site investigation actions and how the investigation will
        proceed.
        3.3.16.10.5. Should a significant anomaly occur which requires extensive depot
        analysis, the AAT investigation will proceed up to a point where a formal request for
        depot assistance is required. In this case, request AFNWC/NWI support.
        3.3.16.10.6. The AAT will prepare a SELM Anomaly Analysis Report (Attachment
        14) detailing results of its investigation. The report will cover all events, analysis
        results and recommendations resulting from the investigation. If further investigation
        by AFNWC/NWI is required, the AAT report will contain a statement that further
        analysis is being conducted by AFNWC/NWI.
        3.3.16.10.7. Fully document all anomalies experienced during any portion of the
        SELM test in the Performance Report. ‖SELECT‖ will provide a final report when
        their investigation is completed.
        3.3.16.10.8. 576 FLTS/CC or designated representative may impound hardware to
        formally evaluate anomaly indications or failures, as required. The fact that an
        anomaly occurred is UNCLASSIFIED; however, classify details of an anomaly or the
        results of an anomaly according to appropriate classification guides.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                      55


3.4. Logistics Procedures. This section covers maintenance actions required to prepare and test
SELM-configured LFs under conditions and configurations approximating an operational launch.
Instructions for a specific unit will be published in the TEOs, as required.
   3.4.1. Missile Wings (90 MW, 91 MW, and 341 MW):
       3.4.1.1. The unit will appoint a maintenance, operations, and security OIC to monitor all
       maintenance/operations/security actions associated with each SELM. Project officers
       will report directly to the TSM on maintenance/operations/security matters associated
       with each SELM test.
       3.4.1.2. Maintenance personnel at each test unit will accomplish test preparation and
       refurbishment. In addition to special test procedures, normal AFGSC maintenance
       procedures and policies will remain in effect. Any deviation from standard procedures
       will require specific approval from the TSM, TM, 576 FLTS representative and 20
       AF/A4.
       3.4.1.3. The operational unit will develop a detailed maintenance flow plan for all
       maintenance test requirements associated with SELM testing.
       3.4.1.4. Clear all unaccomplished TCTOs that would affect a SELM test prior to
       initiation of testing. Do not perform maintenance solely to ensure a successful test. After
       completion of Part I, (and subsequent start-up in SELM configuration), secure and treat
       each test LF as if it were an EWO facility. Perform normal weapon system maintenance.
       Conduct all maintenance at SELM alert test facilities by using appropriately trained
       SELM qualified maintenance teams. Teams dispatching to a SELM LF will pre-
       coordinate with the TSM and/or TM. If pre-coordination is not possible (e.g. a critical or
       emergency situation), notify the TSM and/or TM as soon as practical. If a non-SELM
       trained maintenance team dispatches to a SELM LF, then a SELM trained maintenance
       team must dispatch to the SELM LF to ensure proper completion of maintenance and
       proper SELM configuration. Deviating from this procedure could invalidate test results
       for that LF. Clear any discrepancies/deficiencies found after the test during reposture
       after the test is complete.
       3.4.1.5. All maintenance personnel involved in SELM testing must satisfy AFI 21-202
       training required/qualifications.
       3.4.1.6. All maintenance teams, to include all team members identified to perform
       maintenance in the test squadron, will receive special SELM training. MMOC will be
       provided a roster of personnel/teams identified, briefed, and qualified to perform
       maintenance at test configured LCCs and LFs. Plans and Scheduling, maintenance shop
       schedulers/supervisors, and/or MMOC (as applicable) must assure those maintenance
       teams dispatching to SELM test LFs/LCCs are SELM trained.
       3.4.1.7. Issue test unique Job Control numbers for all tasks associated with this test.
       Over-stamp SELM on work orders. If directed, retain SELM work orders until the
       SELM Performance Report is complete.
       3.4.1.8. Have maintenance teams available to respond to an emergency within the test
       unit on test days. This includes on-site TETs at LFs where ordnance is being expended
       and four QRM teams (one per each non-test flight MAF). Dispatch an additional QRM
       team within each non-test squadron on airborne test day.
56                                                              AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


        3.4.1.9. Meet the requirements for providing maintenance teams to respond to an
        emergency within the test unit on test days (including AAMT, TETs, and QRMs) as
        outlined in this directive.
        3.4.1.10. Use appropriate test designated codes and code components for all test LCCs
        and LFs. Control and handle these components IAW EAP-STRAT Volume 16, ICBM
        Code Component Control Policy and Procedures and AFGSCI 91-1005, Intercontinental
        Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Launch Control and Code Systems.
        3.4.1.11. Isolate interconnectivity and configure SELM test LFs IAW applicable SELM
        T.O. requirements, TEO, this instruction, WSSRs, and the TSD for successful testing
        procedures.
        3.4.1.12. Accomplish refurbishment as soon as possible after completion of the test.
        AFGSC maintenance teams will accomplish LF refurbishment. Support personnel may
        be provided by AFNWC/NWI if requested by the unit and approved by 20 AF/A4.
        3.4.1.13. Unit QA must actively participate in maintenance training and SELM
        configuration to include the following:
            3.4.1.13.1. Providing sufficient personnel to support the SELM test.
            3.4.1.13.2. Reviewing SELM maintenance lesson plans and monitoring initial
            training sessions.
            3.4.1.13.3. Reviewing SELM T.O.s and developing local checklists IAW AFI 21-202
            and T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System.
            3.4.1.13.4. Verifying SELM configuration procedures in the training LF prior to test
            facility deposture.
            3.4.1.13.5. Observing SELM configuration activities at test LFs/LCCs and verifying
            configuration prior to SELM start-up.
            3.4.1.13.6. Participating in ―final inspections‖.
     3.4.2. Equipment Processing:
        3.4.2.1. The MTU contains SELM equipment required for test conduct and is the vehicle
        used to transport SELM equipment between its various destinations. The MTUs
        minimize individual container handling and provide an easy means to inventory and store
        SELM equipment when not in use. At a test unit, the MTU will be transferred to AFGSC
        for duration of test activities. All equipment not in use will either remain locked in the
        MTU or in a secure storage area designated by the TSM.
        3.4.2.2. The MIF contains equipment required to monitor and evaluate ALCS critical and
        non-critical commands. AFNWC/NWI will transport the MIFs to test wings and operate
        them as directed by the TEO and TSD.
  3.4.3. SELM Equip Handling and Processing:
        3.4.3.1. Use DD Form 1149 and supporting documentation for transfer of equipment
        from one agency to another; (e.g., AFGSC to AFNWC/NWI, AFNWC/NWI to AFGSC,
        etc.). Mark Block 4 of DD Form 1149 (ACCOUNTABLE TO ALC ACCOUNT 525SE -
        DO NOT POST).
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                 57


     3.4.3.2. Ship MTUs in a locked/sealed container marked "For GIANT PACE" to the
     maintenance squadron equipment section at each test unit. A set of keys will accompany
     the shipping document (DD Form 1149). The TSM's representative will receive the MTU
     in a locked/sealed condition.
     3.4.3.3. An AFNWC/NWI representative, along with wing representatives, will jointly
     inventory contents of the loaded MTU to item levels. When satisfied inventories are
     correct, both the AFNWC/NWI representative and TSM's representative will sign a copy
     of the shipping document (DD Form 1149). These signatures certify the contents of each
     MTU shipment.
     3.4.3.4. An AFNWC/NWI representative is authorized joint usage of test wing precision
     measurement       electronics     lab     and    electronic  laboratory facilities  for
     repair/calibration/certification as required; however, an AFNWC/NWI representative will
     not impact mission essential work.
     3.4.3.5. Use standard work orders to accomplish installation/removal of SELM
     equipment issued by Plans and Scheduling. Conspicuously stamp these work orders on
     the face "SELM."
     3.4.3.6. Upon conclusion of test activities, remove SELM equipment from the facilities,
     place in their proper containers, and return to TSM's representative. Place equipment in
     the MTU or other secure storage area.
     3.4.3.7. An AFNWC/NWI representative and TSM's representative will jointly inventory
     all equipment when it is returned to the support base after test week. With a correct
     inventory, the TSM's representative will turn over MTU keys to an AFNWC/NWI
     representative. Both representatives will sign and date the DD Form 1149.
     3.4.3.8. An AFNWC/NWI representative will prepare a new DD Form 1149, for
     shipping the MTU to its next destination. The maintenance squadron equipment section,
     upon notification, will comply with shipping instructions from AFNWC/NWI.
     3.4.3.9. The test unit is responsible for lost/damaged equipment while being used for
     SELM. Use existing directives to seek relief from responsibility for property lost or
     damaged while under AFGSC control.
     3.4.3.10. An AFNWC/NWI representative will ensure that action is taken to repair or
     replace, calibrate, and certify the SELM equipment prior to subsequent use.
     3.4.3.11. The local base transportation officer will ship loaded MTUs after instructions
     for shipping are received from an AFNWC/NWI representative.
     3.4.3.12. The 576 FLTS will ensure the UHF radio box is delivered to the next unit
     conducting a SELM.
  3.4.4. Funding:
     3.4.4.1. Non-AFGSC organizations will determine the means of internal
     budgeting/funding required to support this program.      Expenditure of funds by
     AFNWC/NWI in support of SELM will be IAW provisions of applicable Minuteman
     program management directives. Provide on-site technical advice to HQ AFGSC and
     operational units during a SELM
 58                                                           AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


      3.4.4.2. The unit will submit funding requirements to the Program Element Monitor in
      support of the SELM program. ESP Code 7V will be used for all operation and
      maintenance funds obligated in support of the SELM program. The unit will fund all
      depot level reparable (DLR) cost incurred from SELM test from their unit DLR account.
      The TSM will submit a SELM Expense Report to HQ AFGSC/A5R listing all test
      expenses incurred by Element of Expense Investment Code (EEIC) within 90 days from
      completion of test.
3.5. Reporting:
   3.5.1. Reporting is essential for effective SELM program management as well as for
   accurate evaluation of weapon system performance. Reporting requirements encompass two
   primary areas: the status of program events and detailed information following completion
   of each event. 576 FLTS is responsible for ensuring SELM reports are accurate and
   completed IAW the timelines in this instruction.
   3.5.2. SELM Status Report (Attachment 10):
      3.5.2.1. These are used to report the results and completion of Part I (Alert Readiness
      Tests), Part II (SELM Posture), and Part IV (Reposture). The TSM will transmit this
      report within 24 hours of completion of Part I, II, or IV.
      3.5.2.2. Part I results will contain the ART results for each test sortie by test type (i.e.,
      Enable Test, Missile Test, SCNT). The TSM and TM will score test results using the
      following criteria:
          3.5.2.2.1. SUCCESSFUL (S). LF successfully completed designated weapon system
          test with no anomalies noted.
          3.5.2.2.2. SUCCESSFUL WITH ANOMALY (SA). LF successfully completed
          designated weapon system test with any anomaly noted which will not prevent
          launch.
          3.5.2.2.3. FAILURE (F). LF failed designated weapon system test with anomaly that
          would prevent launch.
          3.5.2.2.4. NO TEST (NT). LF was not tested due to it being off alert at time of test
          or T.O. restrictions prevented specific test.
      3.5.2.3. The Part II and IV reports will provide the Zulu date time group that each
      facility entered either SELM or EWO alert. Submit this report after the last sortie is
      postured to SELM alert and when the last sortie is repostured to EWO alert.
      3.5.2.4. The report will be UNCLASSIFIED and must not contain any data on causes of
      failures or failed components.     Provide a description of abnormal indications,
      hardware/software anomalies or test failures in a SECRET follow-up SELM Problem
      Report.
   3.5.3. SELM Problem Report (Attachment 12):
      3.5.3.1. This multipurpose report is used for resolving significant problems or reporting
      preliminary causes of Parts I and III anomalies and failures. The TSM will use this to
      report preliminary causes of failures. Classify it IAW the ICBM SCG.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                     59


     3.5.3.2. The SELM Problem Report will identify test, test unit, problem site, a
     description of problem, T.O. in use when problem was identified, when problem occurred
     or was discovered, probable cause, remarks, and POC.
  3.5.4. SELM Terminal Countdown Report (Attachment 13):
     3.5.4.1. This is used to report results of the Part III Launch Demonstration on each of the
     ground and airborne test days. The TSM will coordinate with the TM and transmit each
     report within 12 hours following ground and airborne tests.
     3.5.4.2. The report will identify commit time, method of commit, LF committed TCD
     time, results by increment, and POC. The TSM and TM will score test results using the
     following criteria:
        3.5.4.2.1. SUCCESSFUL (S). Sortie successfully completed all critical commands
        and TCD with no anomalies noted.
        3.5.4.2.2. SUCCESSFUL WITH ANOMALY (SA). LCC and LF successfully
        completed all critical commands and TCD with any anomaly noted that would not
        prevent launch or sortie successfully completed all critical commands and TCD with
        any anomaly noted during non-LR portion of test.
        3.5.4.2.3. FAILURE (F). LCC failed to correctly process and send critical
        commands to test LF with anomaly that would prevent launch. LF failed to correctly
        process a critical command or TCD with anomaly that would prevent launch
        (Exception: UHF Radio Drawer failures will be scored as SAs).
        3.5.4.2.4. NO TEST (NT). Sortie was not tested or test failure was caused by test
        equipment.
     3.5.4.3. Like the SELM Status Report, this report is UNCLASSIFIED and only indicates
     results for each test LCC and LF. Do not identify any causes of failure or failed
     components. Follow up with classified SELM Problem Report and/or SELM Anomaly
     Analysis Report, if required.
  3.5.5. SELM Anomaly Analysis Report (Attachment 14):
     3.5.5.1. The TSM with 576 FLTS, TM, and ―SELECT‖ coordination will submit this
     report to detail results of an AAT investigation. The report is mandatory for any
     countdown abort or any anomaly occurring during Part III. It is also required anytime the

                           SOFTWARE OPERATIONAL TESTING

4.1. General. The Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting program modified the Minuteman
III LCCs with the Weapon System Control Console (WSCC). The HAC/RMPE portion of the
WSCC provides the WSCC with message processing capability, while the Weapons System
Control Element and its associated COP controls all weapon system related functions.
HAC/RMPE and COP SOTs ensure each new release performs to expected standards. Many
factors influence the HAC/RMPE and COP software, including changes to plans, emergency
requirements changes, and routine upgrades of the operating programs. Of note, this chapter
specifically covers changes for HAC/RMPE and COP as required for an OPlan change, a routine
operating system upgrade or as a result of an identified deficiency in the system. SOT validates
these software modifications and improvements, identifies operational deficiencies, ensures
proper system operation following software modification and improvement, and opportunities
for enhancement.

         4.2.9.2. Coordinate the schedule and changes for all DT&E events with OTO.
4.3. Testing Procedures:
   4.3.1. The SOT process begins with a requirement for an OPlan change, a routine operating
   system upgrade or as a result of an identified deficiency in the system. The process ends
   with results being reported to HQ AFGSC/A3, who makes the final decision on whether the
   software is ready for field deployment. Normally two HAC/RMPE tests per year and one
   COP test per 18 months are conducted in support of modifications and implementation.
   4.3.2. 576 FLTS TD is directly responsible for test accuracy and the successful execution of
   the TSD, which serves as SOT’s detailed test procedures. For HAC/RMPE SOT, this
   document is separated into seven distinct parts: Live Communications testing, EAM
   Processing, EAM Permutations, Confidence Check procedures, Repeat Testing, New Test
   Requirements, and Anomaly Analysis. For COP SOT, this document is separated into five
   distinct parts: Critical Commands, LF Commands/Command Validity, Alarm Management
   and Notification, Display Functions and Anomaly Analysis. The TSD contains demand-
   response, step-by-step testing procedures to thoroughly test the entire software program and
   verify changes meet user requirements (IAW message specification matrices) without any
   adverse effects.

        means available. Test Initiation Messages may be addressed to wings, groups, squadrons,
        flights, individual missiles, or a combination thereof. The message will contain
        appropriate addressing, test identifier (OLYMPIC PLAY), a reference time and
        authentication.
        5.2.3.3. The OLYMPIC PLAY Test Initiation Message authorizes missile combat crews
        to conduct an OLYMPIC PLAY test.
        5.2.3.4. Only mission ready MCCMs may perform weapon system tests during an
        OLYMPIC PLAY test.
        5.2.3.5. The unit conducts an OLYMPIC PLAY test by performing weapon system tests,
        interrogations, and commands listed in Attachment 17. Unless required by T.O. or safety
        constraints, the sequence of testing may be determined locally. For scoring purposes, the
        test consists of only interrogations, commands, and responses and does not include any
        time between test segments.
        5.2.3.6. Initiate all required weapon system tests, interrogations, and commands to each
        LF on alert at test initiation. Conduct the OLYMPIC PLAY test with minimum delay
        consistent with existing operating priorities.
        5.2.3.7. Do not remove LFs from alert after test initiation unless the LF is exempted by

         5.2.4.1.1. Major modifications.
         5.2.4.1.2. Engineering change proposals.
         5.2.4.1.3. Time compliance T.O. changes.
         5.2.4.1.4. Master change log modifications affecting alert status.
     5.2.4.2. LFs identified for OTL, SELM, or special ground tests.
     5.2.4.3. LFs being reported as "F" or "L" category codes in the Missile Sortie Status
     Report at test initiation.
     5.2.4.4. LFs scheduled for retargeting if OLYMPIC PLAY testing will delay completion
     of retargeting actions until after effective time listed in the JPIC for each LF.
     5.2.4.5. LFs returned to alert after reference time specified in the Test Initiation
     Message.
  5.2.5. Reporting:
     5.2.5.1. OLYMPIC PLAY Results Report (Attachment 18).
         5.2.5.1.1. The operational unit OLYMPIC PLAY monitor submits this report to 576
         FLTS/TEMA with copies to HQ AFGSC/A3IT/A4M and 20 AF/A4M within three
         duty days of test completion.
         5.2.5.1.2. The report summarizes results of a single squadron's OLYMPIC PLAY
         test. The report will identify squadron tested, date time group test was started,
         number of LFs tested, the number of LFs scored successful, successful with
         anomalies, total successful, failures, and no-tests, identification and explanation of
         why LFs were scored successful with anomalies, failures and no-tests, and POC for
         the report.
         5.2.5.1.3. Consult technical engineering for technical opinion on LF effectiveness
         whenever an anomaly occurs during an OLYMPIC PLAY test. Scoring will only be
         accomplished for responses that can be attributed to OLYMPIC PLAY commands or
         interrogations. Unrelated responses that are coincidental in timing (a power transfer
         that causes a burnt motor generator, for example) will not result in sortie failure and
         will not be considered a part of OLYMPIC PLAY test. A sortie will be scored based
         on the initial response to a command or interrogation regardless of responses to
         subsequent fault flow actions. Any sortie that exhibits intermittent faults during
         OLYMPIC PLAY tests will be deemed intermittent and scored accordingly during
         each OLYMPIC PLAY test. Score each LF using the following criteria:
            5.2.5.1.3.1. SUCCESSFUL (S). LF successfully completed OLYMPIC PLAY
            with no anomalies noted.
            5.2.5.1.3.2. SUCCESSFUL WITH ANOMALY (SA).          LF successfully
            completed OLYMPIC PLAY with an anomaly noted which would not prevent
            launch.
            5.2.5.1.3.3. FAILURE (F). LF failed OLYMPIC PLAY with an anomaly that
            would prevent launch. (e.g., MCC actions caused LF to fail a portion of the test
            preventing the launch of a launch capable LF; such actions would include LFs
            with incorrect target verification response, computer memory verification check
 68                                                             AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


              for any target or current execution plan case.)
              5.2.5.1.3.4. NO TEST (NT). LF was not tested.

                            OTHER OPERATIONAL TESTING

6.1. General. Modifications and upgrades to the MM III weapon system and support equipment
help ensure the weapon system continues to meet warfighter requirements. IAW AFI 99-103
and AFI 99-103_AFGSC SUP, operational testing outside the scope of OTL, SELM, SOT and
WST is conducted to assess the operational effectiveness and suitability of the SUT and is used
to inform decision makers prior to production or fielding decisions. Ultimately, operational
testing ensures the Minuteman III weapon system maintains an extremely high degree of system
health as it progresses through its lifecycle.
6.2. Testing Procedures:
   6.2.1. All operational tests will be incorporated into the ICBM Test Forecast after the
   appropriate level of test effort is determined by HQ AFGSC/A3. This decision is based on
   system specifications and fielding requirements as outlined in AFI 99-103_AFGSC SUP.
   Once HQ AFGSC/A3 determines the appropriate level of test effort, a Test Screening
   Document will be sent from HQ AFGSC/A3IT to the OTO IAW AFI 99-103_AFGSC SUP
   to ascertain required resource support. The OTO will provide a rough order of magnitude
   that will route through HQ AFGSC/A3IT to the Program Office to ensure all test resource
   requirements are met. After testing concludes, the process ends with results being reported to
   HQ AFGSC/A3.
       6.2.1.1. OTOs may use one of the following assessment or evaluation methods to
       conduct operational testing: Force Development Evaluation (FDE), Tactics Development
       and Evaluation (TD&E), OUE, OA or Early Operational Assessment (EOA).
       Additionally, a Sufficiency of Operational Test Review (SOTR) may be used as outlined
       in AFI 99-103.
       6.2.1.2. All minor modification programs (i.e. Air Force Form 1067 modifications, etc.)
       require operational testing and are covered by this instruction and AFI 99-103. The
       overarching principles of integrated testing must be complied with.
   6.2.2. The OTO is directly responsible for test accuracy and the successful execution of the
   test. Test procedures will be based on the system’s capability document(s); ultimately
   supporting Measures of Effectiveness and Suitability to answer the COIs identified in the
   TP. Test procedures are used to thoroughly test the entire SUT and verify changes meet user
   requirements without any adverse effects to the SUT or system of systems.
6.3. Reporting.
   6.3.1. Quick Look Report. The OTO will provide initial reports following each OT. An
   initial test result notification message ("Quick Look") will be submitted within 12 hours of
   test completion (unless specified differently in the TP due to specific testing requirements).
   This report includes test activities, initial results and an explanation for test activities not
   conducted. Classify the report IAW the ICBM SCG. If an anomaly occurs/is confirmed, an
   anomaly analysis report (Attachment 21) is released in message format as soon as practical.
   6.3.2. Performance Report:
       6.3.2.1. As required by AFI 99-103, this report must address each of the COIs, the
       system’s operational effectiveness, suitability, additional information on operational
74                                                        AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


     capabilities, and include an assessment of operational mission impacts. These reports
     must strike the proper balance between system ca-pabilities and limitations while taking
     into account how well the system performed mission essential tasks. When appropriate, a
     production or fielding recommendation may be included for OUE and FDE final reports.
     All Category I DRs and the top 10 Category II DRs will be listed. Detailed technical
     information should be published in separate data documents. The OTO will submit this
     report to HQ AFGSC/A3 as detailed in Chapter 1 of this instruction.
     6.3.2.2. Classify the report IAW the ICBM SCG.                 Reports will be IAW
     HQ AFGSC/A3IT approved format and include an Executive Summary and cover test
     objectives, significant test issues, configuration, data, performance data, anomalies,
     suggestions for improvements and a fielding/production recommendation consistent with
     guidance in AFI 99-103. Upon request from HQ AFGSC/A3I/A3IT, any required edits
     will be made and the updated report submitted back to HQ AFGSC/A3IT within 48
     hours.

WSSR—Weapon System Safety Rule
WST—weapon system test

Terms
Accuracy—By definition, circular error probable (CEP) is the radius of a circle centered on the
target, where the probability of a score inside the circle is 50%. The radial miss should be no
more than 3 1/2 times the CEP; any impact score beyond this amount is considered a reliability
failure and is therefore not recorded in the accuracy database. The accuracy database is
cumulative and is maintained by HQ AFGSC/A3IN.
Anomaly Analysis Team (AAT) (SELM)—An interdisciplinary, ad hoc group convened to
investigate and determine the anomaly/failure for failure to achieve test objectives due to
hardware/software anomalies, for countdown aborts or for significant anomalies occurring
during Part III (SELM Launch Demonstration).
Component Replacement Request (CRR)—Used to obtain permission to replace selected
operational equipment items that do not meet T.O. requirements.
EWO Configured Missile—An alert missile and war reserve reentry system at an operational
LF.
Flight Worthiness Assessment (FWA)—Used to obtain engineering assessment of component's
ability to perform nominally for use during a test.
Launch Analysis Group (LAG)—An interdisciplinary, ad hoc group convened to investigate
and determine the cause of AFGSC OTL anomalies which do not fall under the missile mishap
criteria IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports and AFI 91-204_AFGSCSUP.
OTL Alert Readiness—Period after which the weapon system, except for VAFB-unique items
such as range safety systems, have been checked and determined ready for launch. Alert
readiness begins at the completion of startup testing (Missile Test and Enable Test) and required
Remote Data Change.
OTL Configured Missile—An operational missile with an OTL RS and the required range
instrumentation and safety equipment.
OTL Identifier—HQ AFGSC will use the unclassified nickname "GLORY TRIP" combined
with a sequential flight test number and weapon system identifier (for example "GLORY TRIP
XXX") to identify a specified OTL mission. OTL Weapon System Identifiers: Minuteman III
GM (WS-133A-M/LGM30G).
OTL Launch Director (LD)—Directs range user, instrumentation checkout, countdowns and
integrates receipt-through-launch operations and maintenance tasks; serves as the primary point
for coordination between the TMs, TF/CC and all VAFB agencies.
OTL Reentry Vehicle/Reentry System (RS/RV)—RS/RV components assembled with non-
nuclear devices as designated in the TEO. The RS includes the shroud, deployment module and
non-nuclear MK21, MK12, MK12A reentry vehicles.
OTL Test Manager (TM)—Manages and controls test activities at VAFB and serves as the
focal point for coordination between outside agencies; during launch countdown, controls the
overall test and ensures adequate sensor coverage to meet test objectives; the TM submits the
final Performance Report.
 84                                                              AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011


Reliability—Weapon system reliability (WSR) for ICBMs is a product of launch reliability,
powered flight reliability, missile guidance set reliability, reentry vehicle reliability, and warhead
(including impact) reliability. For a given ICBM weapon system, the established goal for WSR
is found in the applicable Operations Requirement Document. This report is published by
HQ AFGSC/A5R and is classified SECRET.                   The WSR estimate is cumulative and
HQ AFGSC/A3IN maintains the database.
SELM Test Manager (TM)—Advises and assists the SELM TSM for the following:
preparation of the TSD; approval of all unit SELM lesson plans; directing SELM isolation
verification and countdown activities. Submits the final Performance Report.
Squadron Data Simulator (SDS)—The SDS is an electronic duplication of an entire missile
squadron. It allows for maximum simulation of equipment and environment found in an
operational missile squadron.
Software Operational Test (SOT) Test Director (TD)—Produces the TSD for SOT activities;
responsible for programming of the Message Generator to support testing; senior member and
single point of contact for the test team.; manages and controls test execution; assists the
VIGILANT VANGUARD Test Manager in writing the preliminary and final test reports.
Software Operational Test (SOT) Test Manager—Manages and controls SOT test activities at
VAFB and serves as the single point of contact for coordination between involved parties;
interprets test results and writes preliminary and final test reports.
Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC)—The SMIC uses operationally configured LFs
that are connected to operationally configured LCCs and squadron data simulators. Testing can
be accomplished under operationally realistic conditions without disruption of alert forces or the
risk of nuclear surety issues.
Test Conductor—Airborne—A technical advisor provided by 625 STOS/OSO, aboard the test
aircraft, to coordinate ALCS activities.
Test Execution Order (TEO)—Test specific tasking notification issued by 576 FLTS. Each
TEO contains mission specific requirements and responsibilities, which must be accomplished to
ensure mission success.
Test Order (TO)—A formal tasking document issued by HQ AFGSC/A3I that outlines the
background and purpose of the test, its objective and scope, responsibilities, physical, material,
financial, personnel, priority and reporting requirements. Supplementing information may be
documented in a TO Annex.
Test Plan (TP)—A formal document produced by the OTO providing the complete detailed,
coordinated, and integrated plan for conducting a test to obtain answers to critical operational
issues. Supplementing information may be documented in a TP Annex, when applicable.
Test Screening Document—A formal tasking document issued by HQ AFGSC/A3I requesting
support of a system, software and/or component requiring operational testing prior to fielding.
Due to falling outside the normal OTL, SELM and SOT requirements, this request is commonly
referred to as an out-of-cycle test request. Additional details on out-of-cycle tests requests are
outlined in AFI 99-103, AFGSC Supplement.
Test Support Manager (TSM)—A Lieutenant Colonel designated by the MW/CC to manage
the unit SELM activities.
AFGSCI99-102 2 MARCH 2011                                                                    85


Test Team—For an OTL, consists of LD, TC, Countdown Control Officer (CCO), Launcher
environmental protective system Control Monitor Officer (LCMO), Assistant LCMO (ALCMO)
(if required), Monitor Control Operator (MCO) and Assistant MCO (AMCO). For SOT, consists
of TD, Senior TC (STC), TC. For SELM, consists of TM and TC.
Test Unique Tasks—Those tasks which are not required at the operational unit or which are
performed in a significantly different sequence and are unique to the operational test
environment.
Weapon System Reliability (WSR)—ICBM WSR is the probability that an available sortie will
successfully launch, deliver and detonate a warhead on target. System reliability is measured as
the product of the subsystem reliability.
