This instruction implements Air For Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-1, Command, Control,
Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems. This instruction establishes policy, responsibility and
procedures for assigning, controlling and maintaining local circuit/service restoration precedence for
all government-owned/serviced telephone, data, and special circuits/services and equipment requiring
a special restoration precedence throughout the Eglin AFB complex (this does not include unofficial
and non-mission-essential service). It also establishes a single restoration system to ensure
continuity between joint military/contractor maintained communications facilities/systems on the
Eglin AFB complex. It applies to all AFMC activities on Eglin AFB. This instruction also applies to
non-AFMC associate units to the extent they require services from the host or require interface to
host managed C4 systems. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained in accordance AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

1. Policy. Certain types of local communications circuits/services, due to their specific support
mission requirements, must be restored to service as quickly as possible during emergency
conditions as well as during day-to-day operations.          Circuit/service restorals will be
accomplished based on the restoration precedence assigned to the circuit/service at the time of
the outage as established by this instruction.
2                                                          AACI 33-106      9 FEBRUARY 2001


2. Qualifying Criteria/Restoration Actions. Qualifying criteria to be used to determine/justify
the restoration precedence for circuits/services and the associated restoration actions are listed
below. The 96 CG/CC may stop restoral action on lower precedence work and direct technicians
to higher precedence work. In the event of multiple outages of equal precedence, the 96 CG/CC,
in conjunction with the users, will determine the order of response. Parts will be ordered for all
precedence ratings using the highest priority authorized for the mission supported.
      2.1.     Immediate.       Command and control circuits/services primarily supporting
      emergency/contingency situations, war plans, combat operational forces, safety of flight or
      other safety communications and where no other means of communications are available or
      where loss of service will directly result in mission cancellation/abort. Restoral actions
      will be immediate and continuous until the service is restored, parts are on order or work is
      preempted by another immediate precedence outage or safety considerations.
      2.2. Priority 1. Circuits/services supporting direct mission support and other operational
      matters for which speed of handling is of paramount importance, where no other means of
      communications are available that can satisfy requirements on an interim basis and where a
      continuous high-level precedence is required. Restoral will be accomplished during normal
      duty hours, 7 days per week, and can be deferred to the next day, by higher precedence
      work or by safety considerations.
      2.3. Priority 2. Circuits/service supporting operational matters for which speed of
      handling is of importance, where no other means of communication are available that can
      satisfy requirements on an interim basis and where a precedence higher than routine is
      required. Restoral actions will be accomplished during normal duty hours and can be
      deferred to the next duty day, by higher precedence work, or by safety considerations.
      2.4. Routine. All other circuits/services which do not qualify as immediate or priority.
      Restoral actions will be accomplished as soon as workload permits on an as received basis
      and can be deferred by maintenance personnel.
      2.5. Precedence Exceptions. Circuit/service restorals will be accomplished based on the
      restoration precedence assigned to the circuit/service at the time of the outage as
      established by this instruction, except in cases of validated emergencies which threaten life
      or property and no other means of communications are available.
            2.5.1. The validation authority for these type of exceptions, as they arise, is the 96
            CG/CC or designated representative.
            2.5.2. Emergency precedence requests for circuits that do not have an established
            restoral priority will be submitted to 96 CG/CC, in the format shown in Attachment
            1, not later than the close of business of the first duty day following the reported
            emergency outage. This justification is required regardless of the status of the
            restoration.
3. Responsibilities.
      3.1. Chiefs of AAC organizations and associate units will:
            3.1.1. Ensure that all requirements for immediate or priority restoration of
            communication circuits/services are identified and restoration precedence requests
            qualify according to the criteria outlined in this instruction.
            3.1.2.      Provide communications maintenance personnel with access to
            facilities/buildings under their control during outages.
            3.1.3. Provide representatives to assist communications maintenance technicians
            during outages, as required.

    3.2. Operating/using agencies will:
         3.2.1. Report circuit/service outages (telephones, direct lines, STU-IIIs, etc) to the
         96th Communications Squadron (96 CS) Telephone Trouble Desk at 882-2666x3.
         Consult the base telephone directory for additional instructions on reporting
         circuit/service troubles.
         3.2.2. Report outages of ground radio, radar, cryptographic equipment, navigational
         aides, weather equipment, and other similar special services to the 96 CS
         Maintenance Control at 882-2666x5.
         3.2.3. Report network, e-mail, and small computer related outages to the 96 CG Help
         Desk at 882-2666x0.
         3.2.4. Obtain an outage tracking number for each outage reported to one of the
         functions above to ensure timely follow up actions from all parties involved.
         3.2.5. Provide maintenance agencies with telephone/circuit number, type and
         location of equipment, restoration precedence as established in this instruction and
         name and telephone number of the person to be contacted concerning the outage.
         3.2.6. Submit memorandums for immediate and priority restoration precedence
         requests and annual rejustifications to 96 CG/CC in the format shown in Attachment
         1.
    3.3. The 96 CG will:
         3.3.1. Maintain a listing of all circuits/services and equipment with an approved
         restoration precedence at maintenance control.
         3.3.2. Ensure internal maintenance and control procedures provide for the restoral
         actions prescribed in this instruction.
