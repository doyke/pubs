                                         GENERAL

1.1. Applicability. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield at Grissom ARB must be
familiar with local airfield driving procedures as outlined in this instruction, and must have a
valid Air Force Information Management Tool (AFIMT) 483, Certificate of Competency,
stamped Airfield Authorized and signed by airfield management personnel.
1.2. Environment. Vehicles are required on the airfield to support operations and maintenance.
Although Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs) provide the bulk of required vehicle support,
some situations require augmentation by non-government vehicles. Vehicle traffic greatly
amplifies the potential for collisions, injury, Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft, and
security incidents. Positive control of vehicles and vehicle operators is imperative.

                                             Chapter 2

                                       RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Wing Commander: Designates personnel and agencies to support the Airfield Driving
Program.
     2.1.1. The Wing Commander signs and certifies the Base Airfield Driving Instruction. This
     instruction applies to all host, tenants, transients, civilians, and contractor personnel
     operating a vehicle on the GRISSOM ARB airfield.
     2.1.2. The Wing Commander may waive a 30-day suspension of airfield driving privileges
     based on mission needs. This waiver must be in writing and may not be delegated below the
     Wing Commander.
2.2. Unit Commanders:
     2.2.1. Appoint a primary and alternate Unit Airfield Driving Program Manager (UADPM) in
     writing to conduct training for all their personnel where duties require operating a vehicle on
     the airfield. Forward a copy of the appointment letter to the Deputy Chief, Airfield
     Management (DCAM). NOTE: The UADPM does not have to be the Vehicle Control
     Officer (VCO) / Vehicle Control Non-Commissioned Officer (VCNCO).
        2.2.1.1. It is highly recommended the UADPM appoint trainers to assist with training
        unit personnel on airfield driving. If trainers are used, the Airfield Driving Program
        Manager (ADPM) will provide 434 Data Monitor System (DMS)/DCAM a list of
        authorized trainers.
     2.2.2. Certify personnel are qualified to drive on the airfield. Authority may be delegated to
     the UADPM. If authority is delegated, the DCAM must have a written letter on file from the
     unit commander.
     2.2.3. Ensure all base assigned personnel who operate a vehicle on the airfield complete all
     training and testing requirements. Airfield experience (e.g., operating vehicles or aircraft) is
     not a substitute for completion of airfield driving training and testing requirements.
     2.2.4. Limit the number of personnel authorized to drive on the airfield to the absolute
     minimum necessary to accomplish the mission and limit the number of runway crossings.
     2.2.5. Upon suspension/revocation of a unit member’s base driving privileges,
     suspend/revoke the member’s airfield driving authorization and notify the UADPM and 434
     DMS/DCAM in writing. Request for re-instatement must be processed according to
     paragraph 2.1.2.
2.3. Deputy Chief, Airfield Management (DCAM).
     2.3.1. Develops a local airfield driver’s familiarization program and provides it to the
     UADPMs. NOTE: Attachment 2 will be used as a guide for training. UADPMs may tailor
     this out-line as necessary; however, these are the minimum required training items/subjects.
     2.3.2. Trains all UADPMs on airfield driving requirements, and provides information needed
     to train personnel operating vehicles on the airfield.
434ARWI13-202 14 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     7


   2.3.3. Ensures all assigned Airfield Management personnel are trained and know how to
   operate a vehicle on runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas.
   2.3.4. Coordinates on development of the Airfield Driving Program Instruction to establish
   procedures for a Wing/Base local Flight Line Driver’s Familiarization Program.
   2.3.5. Conducts spot-checks of drivers on the airfield to ensure they have AFIMT 483
   endorsed for flight line driving. All Airfield Management personnel have the authority to
   conduct spot checks and suspend driving privilege of violators of this instruction.
   2.3.6. Conducts joint inspections with the Wing Safety office on all Unit Airfield Driving
   Programs annually. NOTE: The Chief, Airfield Management (CAM) will conduct
   inspections during the absence of the DCAM.
   2.3.7. Develops a system to track the issuance and control of Airfield passes.
2.4. Unit Airfield Driving Program Manager (UADPM):
   2.4.1. Must be trained and certified to drive on the airfield, and have an AFIMT 483.
   Administers the Unit Airfield Driving Program according to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 13-
   213, Chap 4, and this instruction. Provides control tower light gun signal recognition
   training, classroom training (as directed locally), practical airfield driving procedures for day
   (night as required) driving, an airfield driving test (check-ride), and an airfield written test
   (via Computer Base Training (CBT)). NOTE: UADPMs can train and appoint trainers to
   assist in unit airfield driving training. A list of the trainers must be provided to the DCAM.
   If the individual later requires nighttime authorization, the UADPM will ensure training is
   provided (night orientation) and documented. The DCAM (or designated Airfield
   Management representative) will update the AFIMT 483, as required.
   2.4.2. Ensures all trainees are licensed or certified to operate a private, government,
   contractor owned or leased vehicle.
   2.4.3. Ensures all trainees are qualified to drive the vehicle(s) they will operate on the
   airfield.
   2.4.4. Maintains records, associated forms (AFIMT483), and listing of all unit personnel
   authorized to drive on the airfield. Reviews and updates the listing at least quarterly, and
   forwards a copy to 434 DMS/DCAM .

                        FLIGHT LINE OPERATING PROCEDURES

4.1. General. Personnel with a valid AFIMT 483 will comply with the procedures, directions,
and limitations described in this instruction, AFMAN 24-306, and AFOSHSTD 91-100, AFI 13-
213, Chapter 4 and AFI 21-101, Chapter 2.
   4.1.1. All base assigned personnel required to drive on the airfield will receive training as
   outlined in this instruction. TDY personnel will receive a briefing from their sponsoring/host
   unit or will be escorted prior to airfield entry. Personnel acting as an escort must be qualified
   and certified to drive on the airfield.
   4.1.2. The operation of privately owned two or three-wheeled motorized or non-motorized
   vehicles (such as motorcycles, mopeds, scooters) are prohibited on the airfield.
   4.1.3. Speed Limits. No vehicle will be operated at a speed in excess of that deemed
   reasonable and prudent for existing traffic and weather conditions. Emergency vehicles will
   not automatically assume the right of way, and the following speed limits will be observed:

Table 4.1. Speed Limits.
        Speed Limits On Flight Line
        General Purpose Vehicle                                 15 MPH
        Special purpose Vehicles                                10 MPH
        Vehicles Towing Equipment/Explosives                    10 MPH
        Vehicles Towing Equipment in Tandem                     5 MPH
        Vehicle Towing Aircraft                                 5 MPH
        Vehicles Within 25 Feet of an Aircraft                  5 MPH
        Taxiway F (parallel taxiway, conditions permitting)     35 MPH

      4.1.3.1. Airfield Access Roads and Perimeter Roads—15 Miles Per Hour (MPH)
      maximum unless posted otherwise. It is expressly forbidden for any vehicle to use the
      airfield area as a shortcut to any point on or off the airfield that is accessible by roads
      outside the airfield environment. Perimeter roads provide vehicle access from one area of
      the airfield to another. Even though the travel distance and time may be longer, always
      use a perimeter road when it is available.
      4.1.3.2. Emergency response vehicles and designated alert vehicles may exceed 15 MPH
      only when responding to an emergency with emergency flashers on. However,
      emergency vehicles should not assume the right of way and must use the utmost safety
      and caution when responding to an emergency.
      4.1.3.3. Snow removal vehicles may exceed the 15 MPH speed limit while performing
      snow removal operations.
434ARWI13-202 14 OCTOBER 2011                                                                  13


       4.1.3.4. Follow-Me Vehicles. May be operated in excess of 15 MPH only to
       accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of aircraft and when safety is not
       compromised. Tugs will not be used as Follow-Me vehicles at any time.
       4.1.3.5. Driving on the runway will be at a safe speed. If at any time the tower informs
       the operator to expedite off the runway due to arriving/departing aircraft or other
       situation that requires the runway to be free of vehicles, the vehicle operator will depart
       the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway.
   4.1.4. Airfield Access Points: When motor vehicles are operated on unpaved surfaces, rocks
   may become lodged between dual wheels and gravel may stick in the tire treads. For this
   reason, paved access roads will be utilized for all vehicles transitioning to and from the
   airfield. Entry onto the airfield via a non-paved access point is prohibited. Security Forces
   vehicles responding to alert conditions are exempt; however, all-terrain vehicles will remain
   off of the airfield unless mission essential. Ground vehicle operators will stop and check
   tires for FOD prior to entering any portion of the airfield.
   4.1.5. Taxiways are used by aircraft to get to and from the parking ramp/apron and the
   runway. Attachment 13 depicts taxiway signs and markings.
       4.1.5.1. Ground vehicle operators will not drive on the taxiway centerline unless they are
       specifically checking the pavement condition or checking for FOD. Normally, the only
       vehicles that will drive on the centerline are Airfield Management vehicles, Follow-Me
       vehicles, and the sweeper.
       4.1.5.2. Vehicle operators will drive on the far right-hand side of the taxiway in the
       vehicles direction of travel (Attachment 8). Emergency response vehicles may travel on
       the near right-hand side, but safety and caution will be observed. NOTE: DO NOT drive
       on taxiway or runway shoulders.
4.2. Mass Parking Flow Plan.
   4.2.1. All airfield vehicle drivers will comply with the mass parking flow plan (Attachment
   9). NOTE: Snow Removal equipment may deviate from Mass Parking Area (MPA) flow
   plan while performing snow removal operations. The Airfield Management Vehicle may
   deviate from MPA flow plan while performing airfield inspections and/or checks.
       4.2.1.1. Airfield and MPA traffic flow plan deviations are also extended to: 434 Air
       Refueling Wing Commander (ARW/CC), 434 Air Refueling Wing Safety (ARW/SE),
       434 Operations Group Commander (OG/CC), and Operations Coordinator (OC), for all
       movement areas. This privilege is further extended to 434 Air Refueling Wing
       Maintenance Group (ARW/MXG) for respective parking areas only.
       4.2.1.2. All vehicle operators will drive in a clockwise direction while operating in the
       MPA.
       4.2.1.3. Parking in the MPA will be in authorized parking boxes only.
       4.2.1.4. Enter and exit restricted areas through the designated entry control points. All
       vehicles, except emergency and alert vehicles responding to an alert or emergency, will
       stop prior to entering.
4.3. Taxiing Aircraft:
14                                                      434ARWI13-202 14 OCTOBER 2011


  4.3.1. Except for Follow-Me vehicles, vehicles will not be parked in front of or driven into
  the path of taxiing aircraft. Vehicles will not be driven between a taxiing aircraft and its
  Follow-Me guide.
     4.3.1.1. During the hours of darkness (sunset to sunrise), headlights of a vehicle shining
     towards a moving aircraft will be turned OFF immediately so the pilot’s night vision is
     not affected. The vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so its
     position is known. Headlights will remain OFF until the aircraft is out of range and
     turned back on prior to putting the vehicle in motion. Vehicles equipped with daytime
     running lights operating on the airfield, when approaching any aircraft in movement will
     reverse direction and proceed to nearest exit point and will be positioned so that their
     lights will not affect the pilot’s vision.
     4.3.1.2. All vehicle drivers who operate on the parking ramp/apron and taxiways will
     give way to taxiing and towed aircraft. The responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with
     ground vehicle operators. Vehicle operators encountering an aircraft in front or behind
     will exit the taxiway by the shortest route and, if necessary, reverse course to quickly
     move out of the way. Only as a last resort should the vehicle be driven off solid surfaces
     to ensure adequate wingtip clearance for the aircraft. Adequate wingtip clearance is a
     minimum of 25 feet.
     4.3.1.3. Ground vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all aircraft and:
         4.3.1.3.1. Vehicle operators will not cross a taxiway in front of an approaching
         aircraft that is within 200’ or until the aircraft has passed their vehicle by at least
         200’.
         4.3.1.3.2. Vehicle operators will remain at least 100’ away from any helicopter with
         its rotors in motion.
         4.3.1.3.3. Vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to Emergency Response and
         alert vehicles with rotating lights/flasher in motion.
         4.3.1.3.4. Vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to any vehicle that is already
         operating on a taxiway that they wish to enter or cross.
         4.3.1.3.5. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents it operating under its own
         power, every means will be used by the operator to alert any taxiing aircraft in their
         vicinity. As a minimum, the vehicle operator will:
             4.3.1.3.5.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers ON if the
             malfunction occurs during the hours of darkness or reduced visibility.
             4.3.1.3.5.2. If the vehicle has a two-way radio, make the following transmission:
             “All parties BREAK, BREAK—This is (your call sign) with an emergency for
             Airfield Management, Tower, and/or Maintenance.” State the nature of the
             problem and report your position on the airfield.
             4.3.1.3.5.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (security forces, civil
             engineering, transportation, transient alert, etc.) should make every effort to assist
             getting the disabled vehicle off the airfield, especially the parking aprons,
             taxiways, or runway.
434ARWI13-202 14 OCTOBER 2011                                                               15


              4.3.1.3.5.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the
              vehicle and continue attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft in the vicinity.
4.4. Operating In or Across the Controlled Movement Area (CMA): The CMA is the
runway, overruns, and 100 feet either side of runway and overrun edges. Only vehicles with
direct two-way radio contact with the control tower are permitted in the CMA. Vehicle
operators must get permission from the control tower prior to entering or crossing the CMA.

Figure 4.1. Diagram 2.




   4.4.1. If radio contact is lost while operating in the CMA, operators will monitor the tower
   for light gun signals while immediately exiting the CMA. Repeated changes in intensity of
   runway lights signify a need to immediately exit the CMA. If radio failure is known or
   suspected, you must proceed to Airfield Management and brief them on the incident.
   4.4.2. To enter or cross the CMA, the following procedures will be followed:
      4.4.2.1. Contact the control tower and receive permission. Upon receiving permission,
      repeat the control tower’s instructions verbatim before proceeding. (See Attachment 3
      for additional guidance and proper phraseology.)
      4.4.2.2. If equipped, top-mounted rotating emergency lights/flashers must be in operation
      while in the CMA. Vehicles not equipped with top-mounted emergency lights may use
      flashing dash or grill mounted lighting; as a minimum, the hazard lights must be turned
      on.
      4.4.2.3. Personnel in the CMA must constantly monitor their two-way radio for
      instructions from the control tower.
      4.4.2.4. When finished operating in the CMA, contact the tower and report off. NOTE
      1: Personnel requiring access in the CMA that do not have two-way radio contact with
      the tower must be escorted by someone authorized to drive on the airfield, is familiar
      with CMA procedures, and has direct two-way radio contact with and approval from the
      control tower prior to entering the CMA. NOTE 2: The control tower is the only agency
      that permits ground vehicle operations in the CMA—permission may not be
      requested/granted from any other source. Three-way relayed messages to the control
      tower are prohibited. Security Forces (SFS) personnel operate the same as anyone else
      in the CMA except they put their lights on when responding to Bird Aircraft Strike
      Hazard (BASH) requests.
4.5. Runway Hold Lines: Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Hold Line and Instrument (INST) Hold
Line. See Attachment 18 for an explanation and visual reference of these terms.
4.6. Airfield Emergencies:

   4.6.1. Vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all emergency and fire/crash vehicles
   with emergency flashers/rotating lights in motion.
   4.6.2. Vehicles not in direct support of the emergency will remain off of taxiways, the
   runway, and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated.
   4.6.3. During emergency conditions, the control tower will advise aircraft to hold their
   positions so they won’t interfere with responding emergency vehicles. At the towers
   discretion, aircraft may be taxied to a more suitable parking place or holding area that is clear
   of ground vehicles.
4.7. Control Tower Light Gun Signals: ALL vehicles operating on the airfield will be
equipped with a tower light gun signal decal. These decals may be obtained from
http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety or http://www.e-publishing.af.mil Air Force Visual Aid
(AFVA) 11-240, Airport Signs and Markings. Tower light gun signal decals should be displayed
in plain view of the driver in all Air Force Motor Vehicles (AFMV). Vehicle operators will
know and comply with the following signals while operating in the CMA:
4.8. Light Signal Diagram:

Figure 4.2. Diagram 3.




4.9. Vehicle Parking and Operations Near Aircraft:
   4.9.1. Vehicles will not be backed or parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet in front, 200
   feet in back) of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading, unloading,
   servicing, or towing. A spotter will be posted when a vehicle is backed towards an aircraft.
   Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from being backed into aircraft.
   NOTE: Vehicles (maintenance, contractors, mowers, etc.) operating near obstacles on the
   airfield such as taxiway/runway guidance signs, instrument landing system equipment,
   approach lights, etc. will use extreme caution, and in the case of backing up towards these
   obstructions will use a spotter to avoid damage to the vehicle and/or equipment. The
   parking brake on all parked vehicles will be set.
   4.9.2. All unattended vehicles will be parked so they don’t interfere with aircraft being
   towed or taxied. GOV’s parked on the airfield, used by aircraft maintenance, will be parked
434ARWI13-202 14 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   17


   in the designated vehicle parking boxes. Ignition will be turned off, keys left in the ignition,
   and the gear lever put in reverse for vehicles with manual transmissions and in the “parked”
   position for vehicles with automatic transmissions.
   4.9.3. All vehicles parked and left unattended will have Brakes Set Or WILL HAVE wheel
   chocks placed in front of and behind one of the rear wheels. One chock will be placed
   between the tandem wheels of dual (tandem) axle vehicles. The only vehicles exempt from
   these requirements are alert and emergency vehicles responding to an alert or emergency.
      4.9.3.1. Park so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will not be

                                   TRAINING CRITERIA

5.1. The DCAM. The DCAM will develop procedures for issuing AFIMT 483, Certificate of
Competency. All base assigned personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield must be trained on
local procedures, complete the mandatory Airfield Driving CBT, and be licensed and certified to
operate any kind of vehicle, and must have an AFIMT 483, endorsed for airfield driving. The
DCAM or designated representative is the only approval authority for issuance of AFIMT 483.
Authority cannot be delegated outside Airfield Management. The DCAM will provide newly
assigned base personnel with training material on the entire airfield training program regardless
of previous assignments at other military installations. An AFIMT 483, issued at a previous
installation is no longer valid on any Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) bases. The DCAM
and the UADPM have the authority to confiscate previous AFIMT 483s, and restrict Airfield
Driving privileges until the individual receives an AFIMT 483 from Grissom ARB, IN.
   5.1.1. When the back of an AFIMT 483 is completely full, an individual must reaccomplish
   the whole training program before issuance of a new AFIMT 483.
5.2. Testing Requirements:
   5.2.1. The DCAM will outline local testing procedures and responsibilities. The DCAM will
   develop a minimum 25 question multiple-choice test that is updated at least once a year.
5.3. Unit Conducted Training: Base Lesson Plan: An Airfield Driving Training Plan
(Attachment 2) signifies the minimum required topics to be briefed to potential airfield drivers.
Additional and unique unit requirements may also be added to this outline. This instruction will
be used as a baseline to build the training program. Other sources are AFI 24-301, Vehicle
Operations, AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, Chapter 4, AFI 13-204, Functional Management
of Airfield Operations, 434 ARWI 13-201, and AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line -
Ground Operations and Activities. NOTE: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has
runway safety awareness material available to download and /or order for free. Flight Line
Driving Program Managers are highly encouraged to use this supplemental material to enhance
unit programs. Visit http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety/ for further information and a list of
available material.

                                           Chapter 6

           CERTIFICATE SUSPENSION, SURRENDER, REVOCATION AND
                            REINSTATEMENT

6.1. General. Gross or repeated violations of safety or airfield driving rules, or an overall
demonstrated lack of ability on the part of the certificate holder will result in a suspension of
airfield driving privileges, surrender or revocation of the certificate.
   6.1.1. The DCAM or designated representative is authorized to confiscate AFIMT 483,
   and/or airfield Temporary passes from any individual violating the provisions of this
   instruction.
   6.1.2. The DCAM or designated representative is authorized to revoke airfield-driving
   privileges of individuals violating the provisions of this instruction or performing unsafe acts
   on the airfield. A Controlled Movement Area/Airfield Violation Worksheet (Attachment 14)
   will be filled out by airfield management personnel and sent to the offender’s Unit
   Commander with a courtesy copy sent to 434 ARW/SE and 434 Operations Support
   Squadron Airfield Operations Manager (OSS/AOM). A completed copy of AFIMT 651,
   Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) or AFIMT 457, USAF Hazard Report will be
   filled out by the person who witnessed the violation; either form will be sent to
   HQ/AFRC/A3VA. NOTE: All suspended/surrendered/revoked certificates require a written
   letter from the unit commander requesting reinstatement.
6.2. Suspension: Any supervisor in the driver’s chain of command may suspend a driver’s
certificate. All suspensions will be reported to the UADPM and DCAM. Failure to complete
annual refresher training (or if there is no documentation of annual training) is cause for
competency card suspension.
6.3. Surrender: All certificate holders will surrender his/her AFIMT 483 upon request by the
UADPM and/or Airfield Management personnel. Surrendered certificates will be forwarded to
Airfield Management. Airfield drivers who PCS, separate, retire, or no longer need their
certificates should turn them in to the UADPM for disposal.
6.4. Revocation: AFIMT 483 may be revoked by the UADPM, DCAM, or designated
representative. Once revoked, another certificate will not be reissued without the explicit
approval of the DCAM.
6.5. Reporting, Enforcement, and Violation Consequence:
   6.5.1. The Installation Commander or his designee (OG/CC, AOM or DCAM) will
   determine an appropriate punishment for violations and airfield driving infractions. The
   consequences shall be determined based on the facts and circumstances of the violation
   and/or infraction.
   6.5.2. Unit Commanders, UADPMs, and Airfield Management personnel have the authority
   to revoke airfield driving privileges. Unit Commanders and UADPMs will establish
   procedures for reporting and documenting CMA violations and other airfield driving
   infractions. Airfield Management will be notified immediately of any CMA violations.
434ARWI13-202 14 OCTOBER 2011                                                            21


  6.5.3. The DCAM will develop procedures for revoking/suspending/reissuing AFIMT 483 to
  include notification of Unit Commander, and UADPM, when an individual’s airfield driving
  privileges have been revoked/suspended. A runway intrusion is the most serious CMA
  violation and action must be taken to eliminate the potential for reoccurrence. As a
  minimum, airfield driving privileges must be revoked until the individual is re-certified.
  6.5.4. As a minimum notify in writing, the Wing Commander of any person committing a
  runway intrusion, with a courtesy copy to the individual’s Unit/CC, OG/CC, Airfield
  Operations Manager (AOM) and DCAM.
  6.5.5. For runway intrusions that have an adverse impact on flight operations, an AFIMT
  651 must be submitted to 434 ARW/SE. For specific incidents of runway intrusions and
  other CMA violations that do not impact flight operations, the AFIMT 457 will be submitted
  to the DCAM to take immediate action to correct the problem or apply interim control
  measures. When circumstances surrounding the incident cannot be corrected immediately,
  report the incident to 434 ARW/SE. (See AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
  Program.) Ensure a completed AFIMT 651 or AFIMT 457 is sent to HQ/AFRC/A3VA
  6.5.6. All CMA violations including HATRs, regardless of impact on flight safety, must be
  documented in the Airfield Operations Board (AOB) meeting minutes. Units must provide
  specific information (Who, What, When, Where, and How) for trend analysis.

(MPA) is the restricted area at Grissom. The nose docks, 592 and 600 ramps are temporary
restricted areas depending on the type of aircraft in these areas (Attachment 12). Personnel
requiring entry into a restricted area must have an Air Force Entry Control Card, AF
Form1199C, issued by the 434th Security Forces Squadron.
Runway Intrusion—A controlled movement area violation that is the result of unauthorized
entry or erroneous occupation of a runway or other surface used for takeoff and landing or
aircraft regardless of impact on aircraft safety. Aircraft, vehicles, pedestrians, or communication
error between such can cause these incidents.
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)—A vehicle designed for special requirements; this includes
specially designed vehicles such as aircraft towing tractors, fuel trucks, forklifts, bomb lifts, etc.

                                  RADIO PHRASEOLOGY

A3.1. General: When driving on the CMA, proper communication is vital. Both you and the
air traffic controller must ensure that your communications are understood.
   A3.1.1. Never assume anything.
   A3.1.2. Always ask for assistance if you have any doubt about whether to proceed.
   A3.1.3. If the instructions you receive from the tower controller are unclear, ask that they be
   repeated by stating, “Say again.”
   A3.1.4. If there is anything about the instructions you do not understand, ask for further
   explanation.
   A3.1.5. Always repeat or “read-back” your instructions to the tower controller.
A3.2. Radio Communication Procedures:
   A3.2.1. Use a two-way radio capable of communicating with the tower.          Each vehicle
   operator must use an approved call sign identifying the individual, see Attachment 19 (i.e.,
   no two operators will have the same call sign).
   A3.2.2. Think about what you are going to say before calling the tower.
   A3.2.3. Know and use proper phraseology. (Refer to the Aviation Phraseology and Aviation
   Alphabet at the end of this section.) Never use Citizen’s Band (CB) lingo or law
   enforcement “ten” codes.
   A3.2.4. Use the proper sequence in calling the tower. Before you start talking, make sure no
   one else is already talking. Then key your microphone and do the following:
      A3.2.4.1. State whom you are calling and identify yourself by using your vehicle call
      sign. Example: “Grissom Tower, Airfield One.”
      A3.2.4.2. Wait for the tower controller to respond. Be patient, controllers may be busy.
      When the controller responds, “Airfield One, Grissom Tower,” state where you are and
      where you want to go. Example: “Airfield One on Taxiway Alpha. Request access onto
      the runway.” NOTE: The order in which you state where you are and where you want to
      go is unimportant. You can easily state where you want to go and where you are located
      instead. For example, “Airfield One requests access onto the runway from taxiway
      Alpha.” The important thing to remember is BOTH pieces of information are required—
      where you are and where you’re going.
      A3.2.4.3. Wait for the controller’s response. The controller will either approve or deny
      your request, or give you modified instructions. Example: “Airfield One, proceed onto
      the runway. Report when off.”
      A3.2.4.4. ALWAYS read back instructions from the tower. Example: “Airfield One
      proceeding onto the runway. Will report when off.”

      TDY BRIEFING FOR TDY FLIGHT LINE DRIVERS AND CONTRACTORS

A17.1. General: This briefing establishes policies and procedures for control of vehicle
operations on the airfield in accordance with 434 ARWI 13-202, Base Airfield Driving
Instruction. It authorizes TDY personnel qualified to drive on his/her home station airfield, and
in possession of AFIMT 483, Certificate of Competency, to operate on the Grissom ARB
airfield. Airfield vehicle operations are covered in AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 25, AFOSHSTD
91-100, and 434 ARWI 13-202, and must be strictly complied with. Airfield driving privileges
are good only for the duration of the TDY and/or contract. NOTE: These are the MINIMUM
briefing requirements for TDY and contractor personnel. UADPMs may add additional/unique
unit requirements as necessary.
A17.2. Precautions:
   A17.2.1. The Grissom airfield is a large and busy complex. Driving on taxiways and ramps
   will be kept to a minimum and in direct support of mission aircraft.
   A17.2.2. NEVER operate a vehicle within 100 feet of the runway edge or attempt to enter or
   cross the runway without prior permission from the control tower.
   A17.2.3. Vehicle operators will do FOD CHECKS prior to entering the airfield (taxiways,
   parking aprons, etc). FOD CHECKS will be accomplished when entering or crossing any
   taxiway, ramp, or runway from an access road/unpaved surface or when exiting a
   construction area.
   A17.2.4. Do not cross taxiways when an approaching aircraft is within 200 feet or until it
   has passed by at least 200 feet.
   A17.2.5. Always yield to taxiing aircraft and emergency response vehicles.
   A17.2.6. Vehicles stopped for aircraft holding on a taxiway will not cross the taxiway in
   front of the aircraft unless signaled to do so by the pilot.
   A17.2.7. Remain at least 100 feet from helicopters with rotors in motion.
   A17.2.8. Exercises or other priority maintenance missions are NOT an emergency. You
   must adhere to established speed limits.
   A17.2.9. Personal radios will not be used in vehicles operating on the airfield. This includes
   AM/FM radios, tape players, and personal stereos (walkmans, etc.).
   A17.2.10. Always drive on the FAR RIGHT side of a taxiway.
   A17.2.11. Do not pass a stopped or towed aircraft unless the aircrew or marshaller indicates
   that you may proceed. Maintain at least 25 foot lateral clearance.
   A17.2.12. If you encounter an aircraft coming towards you, do one of the following:
       A17.2.12.1. Turn around and exit the taxiway at the next paved surface.
       A17.2.12.2. As a last resort, drive into a grassy area and maintain at least a 25foot
