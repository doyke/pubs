SOW) personnel reporting units’ status of Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of

Summary of Changes

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include administrative corrections, an updated sample letter and new format.
2.7.3.1.1. (Added) Wing Level ART OPRs are delegated the authority by 919
SOW/Commander (CC) to manage and direct necessary actions to successfully implement and
2                                            AFI10-244_919SOWSUP 9 SEPTEMBER 2009


sustain the ART program at 919 SOW. They will keep 919 SOW/CC advised on wing readiness
status as reflected in the ART report, and local implementation status of current and subsequent
versions of ART. They are not responsible for making unit inputs to the ART.
2.7.3.4.1. (Added) Wing Level ART OPRs will develop local training that will supplement the
training and guidance provided in the ART 3.0 User’s Manual. All local training will be based
on higher headquarters guidance and intent. Local training will be required on an annual basis
for ART ‘Approvers’ and ‘Monitors’ in order to ensure trained personnel are updating ART data.
Local training requirements must be satisfied before initial requests for ART ‘Approver’ or
‘Monitor’ roles will be approved. Local training requirements must also be satisfied annually to
retain ART ‘Approver’ or ‘Monitor’ roles. ART ‘Approver’ or ‘Monitors’ who become non-
current without prior coordination with the Wing ART OPR will be removed from the ART
system and a new role requested when training requirement are satisfied. ART ‘Approvers’ or
‘Monitors’ who had approved accounts prior to release of this supplement will have 120 days
from the date of this supplement to complete local training.
2.7.3.4.2. (Added) Air Force or MAJCOM provided training for ART 3.0 is nonexistent as of
this publication. ART was implemented Air Force wide without a formal training program. The
application contains an excellent user’s manual. Units will use the ART 3.0 User’s Manual as a
guide for accomplishing the ART reports. Units will not use lack of training to justify inaction
or unnecessary delay in local implementation and reporting.
2.7.4.1.1. (Added) Units will establish ART Approver and Monitor roles. Approvers and
monitors lost due to personnel changes, etc. will be replaced immediately to ensure the unit
maintains its ART reporting capability.
2.7.4.1.1.1. (Added) Units will establish a minimum of one ART Approver role. Because the
squadron/unit commander is the authority for status of the unit’s UTC(s) as reported in ART, the
commander is the preferred person to hold the ART Approver role. The commander may
delegate approval authority to a competent authority within the same unit. The person to whom
authority is delegated must be considered carefully as commanders can delegate authority, but
not responsibility.
2.7.4.1.1.2. (Added) Units will establish sufficient ART Monitor roles to ensure that reporting
can be accomplished on time. Availability of reservists or lack thereof, is not an acceptable
reason for late or unreported UTCs. Unit commanders will manage their assets and assign or
delegate responsibility in a manner that ensures ART reporting is accomplished on time. This
includes, but is not limited to, rescheduling of UTA periods or placing personnel on annul tour
status to comply with ART reporting requirements.
2.7.4.2.1. (Added) Appointment letter will include name(s), rank, security clearance, office
symbol, role (Approver or Monitor), and duty phone. Example letter attached. Role
appointment should not be updated no sooner than every 18 months unless there is a change of
command, or person leaves Unit.
2.7.4.3.1. (Added) Reporting will be accomplished by units through use of the ART 3.0
application residing on the SIPRNET.
2.7.4.3.2. (Added) Units will, as a minimum, obtain access to the SIPRNET. The desired end
state is to have SIPRNET connectivity at the unit if fiscally possible. Units should plan and
budget toward this desired end state. If SIPRNET connectivity cannot be established at your unit

or work center, the unit will gain access via shared/borrowed resources, etc. Regardless of
means, SIPRNET access is a unit responsibility.
