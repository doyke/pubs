SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been revised and should be reviewed in its entirety. Renumbered
numerous paragraphs to align with the most current version of AFI 21-103; deleted all redundant
information requests; Office symbols and publication references were updated throughout. This
revision updates all applicable office symbols/publication references, and renumbers paragraphs
to align with new parent instruction. It also gives the option to request either a Ground
Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA) or a Training Aid Aircraft (TAA). Procedures will be the
same for either a GITA or a TAA request.     .
4.5.3. (Added) Requesting Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA) or Training Aid
Aircraft (TAA). To request a GITA or TAA, the following procedures apply:
4.5.3.1. (Added) Training wings prepare a justification package as outlined in Attachment 12
(Added).
4.5.3.2. (Added) Training wings prepare a cover memorandum for the wing commander's
signature with a summary of requirements which will include:
4.5.3.2.1. (Added) Type aircraft.
4.5.3.2.2. (Added) Number aircraft required.
4.5.3.2.3. (Added) Date required.
4.5.3.2.4. (Added) Title of course.
4.5.3.2.5. (Added) Weekly utilization.
4.5.3.2.6. (Added) Number students programmed by fiscal year (3 years).
4.5.3.2.7. (Added) Impact if aircraft cannot be provided.
4.5.4. (Added) Training wings will submit the package and cover memorandum to 2 AF/TTOC-
O and HQ AETC/A3T, IN TURN, with an info copy to HQ AETC/A4MAA-AVDO.
4.5.5. (Added) HQ AETC/A3T, in coordination with HQ AETC/A4MAA-AVDO, will review
the package and forward it to HQ USAF/A8PB, as applicable, for appropriate action.
4.5.6. (Added) Training wings will develop local procedures to ensure maximum cross
utilization of assigned GITA and TAA between courses. Additionally, training wings will collect
utilization data on each assigned GITA and TAA and annually review that data to determine if
GITA and TAA are still needed to support training. Projected student loads, future training
requirements, and other training wing requirements will be considered before GITA or TAA are
declared as excess.
4.5.7. (Added) Training wings will request aircraft save lists for each GITA or TAA except
those needed to support crew chief courses. AFI 21-101, Aircraft And Equipment Maintenance
Management , provides wide latitude in determining what save list parts need to be removed
from GITA and TAA. It also provides the ability to retain operational systems required to
support cross utilization of GITA or TAA to support future training. Wings will only remove and
turn into base supply save list components, engines, and parts whose removal will not cause any
training degradation or do not disfigure the external appearance of the aircraft. Additionally, do
not remove components, engines, or parts that will hinder the ability to cross utilize GITA or
AFI16-402_AETCSUP 5 OCTOBER 2011                                                               3


TAA to support more than one course or components needed to support future training
requirements. In AETC, GITA used in crew chief and mission ready technician courses will be
maintained in complete configuration and as close to operational configuration as possible.
Wings will only remove save list parts from these GITA and TAA not needed to facilitate
training.
4.5.8. (Added) Training wings will declare all GITA and TAA excess that are not required only
after determining there are no other current or anticipated requirements within the wing. Report
excess GITA or TAA to 2 AF/TTOC-O, HQ AETC/A3T, and HQ AETC/A4MAA-AVDO, IN
TURN. Include the following information:
4.5.8.1. (Added) Equipment designator.
4.5.8.2. (Added) Serial number.
4.5.8.3. (Added) Date aircraft will be excess.
4.5.8.4. (Added) Course supported.
4.5.8.5. (Added) Reason the aircraft is becoming excess.
4.5.8.6. (Added) Systems that are operational.
4.5.8.7. (Added) Statement of general condition.
4.5.8.8. (Added) Statement of suitability for display or donation.
NOTE: The requirements in paragraphs 4.5.2 and 4.5.5 are exempt from the reports control
symbol requirement under AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports Management
Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.
4.19.5. (Added) HQ AETC/A4MAA-AVDO will perform command AVDO duties.
4.20.7. (Added) Wings will appoint qualified individuals, primary and alternate to perform
AVDO duties and send a copy of the appointment memorandum to HQ AETC/A4MAA-AVDO.
