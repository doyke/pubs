PART I

Preface
1. The changing Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) and Air and
Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) environments require vision, preparation, and attention to ensure
people have the right skills and tools to deliver the C4I capabilities and the support required by the war
fighter in meeting the Air Force mission of today and the vision of the future. Declining resources,
expanding diversity of mission, and ever-changing technologies in the Air Force are impacting the
availability of our most valuable resource--people. These factors will continue to exist in the future, making
it essential for the work force to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level
of an Air Force Specialty (AFS). To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the Air Force must place a greater
emphasis on career field training. This Ground Radar Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP)
is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle training/education requirements,
support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 3D1X5 specialty. The plan is a "training
road map" for the career field. It provides personnel a clear career path to success and makes career field
training identifiable, measurable, and budget defensible.

2. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life cycle education and
training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.
The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts. Management uses both
parts in conjunction with the Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage, and control training within the
career field. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position
qualification training.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty
qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); and Section D indicates resource
constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition
training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes
duties, tasks, TRs to support training, AETC conducted training, wartime course and core tasks, and
correspondence course requirements. Section B: contains the Course Objectives List (COL) and training
standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C: identifies
available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package, which may be developed to
support proficiency training; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine
resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E
identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training
required for the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to
identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

3. Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training
for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers. This plan enables the Air Force
to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

established to develop, integrate, and deploy combat support information capabilities. The mission of
GCSS-AF is to provide timely, accurate, and trusted Agile Combat Support (ACS) information to Joint and
Air Force commanders, their staffs, and ACS personnel at all ranks and echelons with the appropriate level
of security needed to execute the Air Force mission throughout the spectrum of military operations. GCSS-
AF is the means by which ACS functional systems will be modernized and integrated to improve business
processes supported on a single robust network-centric infrastructure. In addition to integrating combat
support applications, GCSS-AF also provides core enterprise services such as a common user
presentation through the AF Portal, Enterprise Information Management (Workflow, Records Management,
Document Management, Knowledge Management, and Collaboration), and an enterprise data warehouse.
Global Command and Control System (GCCS). An automated information system designed to support
deliberate and crisis planning with the use of an integrated set of analytic tools and flexible data transfer

war fighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and
implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology, multiple radio types (e.g.
handheld, ground-mobile, airborne, maritime, etc.) are now allowed to communicate with one another. The
ultimate goal is to produce a family of interoperable, modular, software-defined radios that operate as
nodes in a network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for mobile and fixed
forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies, joint and coalition partners, and disaster response personnel.
Knowledge Based Operations (KBO). KBO is the Air Force approach for managing information and
intellectual capital assets, such as people, processes and tools. Having timely, accurate, and relevant
information is critical to build the Air Force’s information superiority.
Knowledge Management (KM). The handling, directing, governing, or controlling of natural knowledge
processes (acquire/validate, produce, transfer/integrate knowledge) within an organization in order to
achieve the goals and objectives of the organization. KM seeks to make the best use of the knowledge
available to an organization, creating new knowledge, and increasing awareness and understanding in the
process. KM can also be defined as the capturing, organizing, and storing of knowledge and experiences
of individual workers and groups within an organization and making this information available to others in
the organization. (AFPD 33-3)
Knowledge Training. Training used to provide a base of knowledge for task performance. It may also be
used in lieu of task performance when the training capability does not exist. Learning gained through
knowledge rather than hands-on experience (AFI 36-2201).

any CFETP changes or enlisted classification directory descriptions.
Specialty Training Standard (STS). An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force specialty in
terms of tasks and knowledge that an airman in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on
the job. Also identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level within an enlisted AFS. It
further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to show which of the overall training
requirements for an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) are taught in formal schools and correspondence
courses.
Standard. An exact value, a physical entity, or an abstract concept established and defined by authority,

security through a single AF Portal log on.
Training Capability. The capability of a training setting to provide training on specified requirements,
based on the availability of resources.
Training Planning Team (TPT). Comprised of the same personnel as a U&TW, TPTs are more intimately
involved in training development and the range of issues examined is greater than in the U&TW forum.
Training Requirements Analysis (TRA). A detailed analysis of tasks for a particular AFSC to be included
in the training decision process.
Training Setting. The type of forum in which training is provided (formal resident school, on-the-job, field
training, mobile training team, self-study, etc.).
Unit Type Code (UTC). A five-character alphanumeric code identifying a specific force package of
personnel and/or equipment. The UTC is the means for linking logistics and manpower details within a unit
type and is used to communicate force data. The UTC represents a wartime capability designed to fill a
valid contingency requirement.
Upgrade Training. Training that leads to the award of a higher skill level.
Utilization and Training Pattern. A depiction of the training provided to, and the jobs performed by,
personnel throughout their tenure within a career field or AFS. There are two types of patterns: 1) Current
pattern, which is based on the training provided to incumbents and the jobs to which they have been and
are assigned; and 2) Alternate pattern, which considers proposed changes in manpower, personnel, and
training policies.
Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW). A forum of the AFCFM, MAJCOM Functional Managers,
subject matter experts (SME), and AETC training personnel that determines career ladder training
requirements. This is an executive decision meeting following the Specialty Training Requirements Team
meeting.
Wartime Tasks. Those tasks which must be taught when courses are accelerated during a wartime
environment. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a
streamlined training environment. These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied
to their schoolhouse tasks.
Workflow. A series of steps necessary for the initiation, tracking, and delivery of services or outputs with
the capability to cut across existing or future organizational boundaries. Furthermore, web-based workflow
products allow electronic coordination, staffing, and task management of documents and files. They are
relational to an electronic version of the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and other AF/DoD forms used for
routing/collection of information. Automation provides the capability to suspense and track correspondence
through the workflow process and provides action officers and document originators status on their
packages. Provides users the capabilities to comply with structured electronic workflow processes and the
flexibility to create/develop ad hoc workflow courses of actions. Future use of standardized EIM tools will
enhance usability and eliminate legacy methods.

Section A - General Information
1. Purpose of the CFETP. This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM
Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop,
manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the initial
skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training those individuals in AFSC 3D1X5 should
receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers. Initial skills training is the AFS specific
training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the
3-skill level. This training is provided by the 338th Training Squadron (TRS) at Keesler AFB, MS.
Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development
Course (CDC) completion, and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It
is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is
formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-
residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to
increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several
purposes, some of which are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training
program. Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's
career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training
medium.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training
program.


2. Use of the CFETP. The CFETP is maintained by the 3D1XX Air Force Career Field Manager
(AFCFM), SAF/CIO A6OD. MAJCOM FMs and AETC review the plan annually to ensure currency and
accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM. Using the list of courses in Part II, they
determine whether duplicate training exists and take steps to eliminate/prevent duplicate efforts. Career
field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training
program is available for each individual in the career ladder.
2.1. AETC training personnel develop/revise formal resident and exportable training based upon
requirements established by the users and documented in the STS. They also develop procurement and
acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.
2.2. MAJCOM FMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP for mandatory initial skill and
upgrade requirements. They also identify the needed AFJQSs/AFQTPs to document unique upgrade and
continuation training requirements. Requirements are satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract
training, or exportable courseware/courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be
included in this plan.
2.3. 81st TRSS Qualification Training Flight (Q-Flight) personnel develop training packages
(AFJQSs/AFQTPs) based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities
assigned by the AFCFM.
2.4. Unit level training managers and supervisors manage and control progression through the career
field by ensuring individuals complete the mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified in this
plan and supplemented by their MAJCOM. The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference for
planning continuation or career enhancement training.
2.5. Submit recommended improvements/corrections to the 338th TRS/TRR Training Manager.




                                                      9
3. Coordination and Approval of the CFETP. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements. The
AETC training manager initiates an annual review of this document by AETC and MAJCOM functional
managers to ensure the CFETP’s currency and accuracy by using the list of courses in Part II to eliminate
duplicate training.

5. Skill/Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to
superintendent skill levels play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. It is
essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage and conduct an effective training
program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP and the 3D1X5 Education and Training Path
able will ensure individuals receive viable training at appropriate points in their careers.




6. Training Decisions. This CFETP was developed to encapsulate an entire spectrum of training
requirements for the Radar career field, using a building block approach (simple to complex). Included in
this spectrum was the strategy of when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy
must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to
training.
6.1. Proficiency Training. This training is job qualification for an assigned duty position. Additional
qualification training becomes necessary when personnel transfer to another duty position, the unit
mission changes, a new personnel program comes on board, or any time changes in techniques or
procedures occur.
6.1.1. The 81st TRSS/TSQ (Q-Flight) develops AFJQSs/AFQTPs to support tasks relating to
communications-electronics and communications-computer systems, functions and duties. Completion of
AFJQSs/AFQTPs is mandatory by duty position for personnel in upgrade or qualification training.
6.1.2. CDC development is restricted to six volumes, two hundred pages each. The first volumes will be
common to all 3D1XX AFSC, followed by the respective AFSC-specific volumes. The following table
outlines 5-level CDC contents.

2.4. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the tasks, knowledge and proficiency levels
referenced in paragraph 2. Columns are marked with a proficiency code to indicate subjects taught. An
X in the proficiency code column indicates a lack of student man years and instructor resources.
Trainees without prerequisites specified in Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) cannot
be expected to meet proficiency levels indicated.
2.5. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623,
Individual Training Record folder and used according to AFI 36-2201.
2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement
Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample
knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate
for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.
Individual responsibilities are listed in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing
System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.

3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC
training. A Training Feedback Hotline has been installed for the supervisors' convenience. For a quick
response to concerns, call our Training Feedback Hotline at DSN 597-4566, fax us at DSN 597-3790, or
e-mail us at 81trg-tget@keesler.af.mil. Reference this STS and identify the specific area of concern
(paragraph, training standard element, etc).

    NOTE 1: Dashed items in this CTS are not part of the original CTS created at the March 2009 IT
    Fundamentals conference however, they are the specific objectives taught in the IT Fundamentals course
    designed to meet the CTS requirements.
    NOTE 2: Unless otherwise stated, students may be allowed two assists from the instructor and still
    successfully achieve the proper level of proficiency. An instructor assist is anytime an instructor must
    intercede to provide guidance to a student which leads to a satisfactory completion of the objective or to
    prevent the student from continuing in a manner that will lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion, safety
    violation, or damage to equipment.
    NOTE 3: All 3-level tasks will be trained if a wartime surge is ordered.

*   A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
    task. (Example: b and 1b)
** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for
   a subject common to several tasks. This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in
   the course or CDC.
X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.
NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

NOTE 2: Knowledge and/or performance tasks are defined in the AFJQS. AFJQS items set the standard
for qualification and certification and are mandatory for use in conjunction with this STS when applicable
to the duty position.

NOTE 3: AFQTP 3DXXX-232A, Communications and Information Work Center Supervisor's Handbook is
mandatory for upgrade to the 7-skill level in all 3DXXX career fields.

NOTE 4: All objectives are trained during wartime.

NOTE 5: Commanders, supervisors and trainers will use TBA to track and manage training for all 3DXXX
personnel.

NOTE 6: When an AFJQS is loaded into TBA, AFJQS task numbering will vary from the STS. The
numbering scheme is defined by your work center specific master training plan.

NOTE 7: Third person certification is not required for all Cyber Support Specialist personnel. However,
members (to include civilians and contractors) assigned to crew positions are still required position
certification in accordance with AFI 33-115 Volume 1.

NOTE 8: In the event of data network or computer system failure, courses are authorized to use
alternative methods of instruction to fulfill this STS element.

NOTE 9: Unless otherwise stated in the objective, the student may be allowed two assists from the
instructor and still successfully achieve the proper level of proficiency. An instructor assist is defined as
anytime an instructor must intercede to provide guidance to a student which leads to a satisfactory
completion of the objective or to prevent a student from continuing in a manner which will lead to an
unsatisfactory conclusion, safety violation, or damage to the equipment. Successful students have
performed the task to the satisfaction of the course; however, they may not be capable of meeting the
field requirements for speed or accuracy.

NOTE 10: All equipment related objectives are performed by following procedures from technical orders,
technical manuals, or student instructional material developed by the training facility.

NOTE 11: MSgts in the 3DXXX AFSCs no longer require an Individual Training Plan (ITP) with the
following exceptions: personnel in upgrade training status. Unit Commanders can require MSgt's with
UTC tasks to have an ITP.

*      A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
       task. (Example: b and 1b)
**     A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for
       a subject common to several tasks. This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in
       the course or CDC.
X      This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.
NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.
(-)    When this code is used in the Core Task Column it indicates that the qualification is a local determination.

Section B - Course Objective List
4. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge, which
is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a
performance progress check and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and
performance elements using a written test and a progress check.

5. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement
are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is
provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the
behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the
student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially
proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.

7. Course Objectives. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Block of Instruction.
Because the communications career field is ever changing, we are providing the Course Training
Manager Office and phone number. As training managers also change the phone number will provide a
link to the course thereby a quicker avenue to answer any questions that may arise. This OPR/POC is
