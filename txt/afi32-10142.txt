                  FACILITIES BOARD ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Facilities Board (FB) Purpose. The Air Force will provide sustainable installations and
facilities to effectively perform its missions and support its people. Sustainable installations
provide required mission support in an economically efficient and compliant manner, leveraging
available resources for the long-term benefit of the Air Force. The FB acts as the installation’s
local decision-making body for the acquisition, construction, use, maintenance, modification,
consolidation, development, demolition, and disposal of built and natural infrastructure at Air
Force managed installations. The FB ensures an installation asset portfolio perspective is applied
in all decisions and advisory actions. The FB is chaired by the Installation Commander (CC) or
designated representative, and is supported by the Facilities Board Working Group (FBWG).
Additional working groups/sub-working groups may be directed by the Installation Commander.
The FB Chair has the authority to delegate responsibilities as appropriate. At overseas locations,
coordination with host nation liaison offices and/or host nation Forces/NATO representatives
may be required. This instruction does not delegate any authority to the Facilities Board which
only may be exercised by the Installation Commander. This instruction does not provide
authorities to the Facilities Board for specific project/transaction approvals where existing AF
policy mandates higher headquarters approvals.
1.2. FB Responsibilities. The FB validates requirements and proposes solutions seeking the
most effective and efficient course of action. The FB ensures the installation mission needs are
effectively met with the minimum number of real property assets at the lowest life-cycle cost by
implementing asset management principles.
     1.2.1. The FB oversees and ensures the development, modernization and sustainment of the
     installation’s built and natural infrastructure in accordance with the approved Installation
     Development Plan (IDP), the Base Comprehensive Asset Management Plan (BCAMP), and
     other plans as applicable (e.g. Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP), Air
     Installation Compatible Use Zone Study, Installation Complex Encroachment Management
     Action Plan (ICEMAP), etc.). This oversight includes, but is not limited to:
        1.2.1.1. Validates the IDP, prior to Installation Commander endorsement, to ensure it
        accurately reflects the installation’s current vision, goals, objectives and physical
        development as prescribed in AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning, and is
        consistent with enterprise strategic direction as described in the annual Defense Planning
        Guidance and Air Force supplements. (T-2)
        1.2.1.2. Approval of facility/project site requests as prescribed in AFI 32-7062. (T-2)

        1.2.1.4. Approval of installation facilities standards including the Architectural
        Compatibility Plan. (T-3)
     1.2.2. The FB provides installation wide oversight to maximize the AF value of existing
     built and natural infrastructure as defined in DoD Instruction 4165.14, Real Property
     Inventory and Forecasting and AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting;
AFI32-10142 14 MAY 2013                                                                             3

   of Real Property; and DoD Instruction 4165.72, Real Property Disposal and AFI 32-9004,
   Disposal of Real Property. This oversight includes, but is not limited to:
       1.2.2.1. Approval of the utilization of existing facility space in accordance with
       applicable space authorizations and standards (e.g. consolidation and demolition
       opportunities, new space requests, etc.), to include all tenants. (T-1)
       1.2.2.2. Review and approval of proposed real property transactions, to include, in-
