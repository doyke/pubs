     3.2. Each group commander will appoint a GAPM to ensure subordinate squadrons meet the
     intent of this directive. Forward appointment letters assigning the GAPM and an alternate to
     the MSG/CCC at least annually or when changes occur. AFOTEC Det 5/CC will appoint a
     GAPM for the Associate Units.
EDWARDSAFBI10-243 29 AUGUST 2013                                                            5


   3.3. Each squadron commander who has members assigned to the READY Program will
   appoint a SAC to track availability of assigned individuals unless the GAPM takes on SAC
   duties. When a member becomes unavailable, squadron commanders are responsible for
   replacing them from within their organization. Forward appointment letters assigning a
   coordinator and alternate to respective GAPM at least annually or when changes occur.
   3.4. Prior to presenting issues to the READY Review Board, they must be coordinated
   through the owning Group Commander and then submitted to the RPM for discussion at the
   READY Working Group meeting.
   3.5. The total number of augmentees trained should be enough to allow for leave, PCS, TDY
   and retirements. Prior to augmentees departing for leave, PCS, TDY, or retirement, the SAC
   must ensure replacements are identified and trained. Close coordination between RPM,
   GAPM and SAC must be established to ensure there are no shortfalls in providing augmentee
   replacements. The squadron commander is ultimately responsible to ensure there are no gaps
   in the augmentation service provided to the RPM.
4. Establishing and Implementing Augmentation Requirements.
   4.1. Squadron Commanders should appoint augmentees with at least 12 months remaining
   time on station (TOS). Once appointed, augmentees will remain in the duty until replaced by
   the squadron commander (one year after initial training is conducted is the expected
   minimum time in augmentation duty). Units must request training for and replace
   augmentees 60 days prior to removing them from augmentee duty due to PCS, extended
   TDY, retirement, pregnancy or any other reason that affects their availability.
   4.2. Augmentees may only be activated by the Crisis Action Team (CAT), Emergency
   Operations Center (EOC) Director, Command Chief, MSG/CCC (RPM) Mission Support
   Group Commander, Installation Vice Commander or Installation Commander. A CAT
   Directive (CATD) will be sent out to all Unit Control Centers outlining taskings to parent
   organizations. Group Commanders will ensure unit allocations have been released to the
   augmented unit.
5. READY Program Assumptions.
   5.1. The READY Program identifies functions that need to be trained in advance. It is up to
   each augmented unit to provide the necessary training.
   5.2. Basic eligibility is E-6 and below with at least 12 months remaining TOS. Commanders
   may use their discretion to utilize other ranks or civilians, when necessary. However,
   commanders should be cognizant of the training status of all members prior to appointment
   to the augmentation program.
   5.3. The two parent organizations at Edwards AFB are 412 TW and the Associate Units.
   AFOTEC Det 5/CC will act as the coordinating commander for all AF Associate Units
   assigned to Edwards AFB. This role will be limited to coordinating Associate Unit responses
   with TW requests for READY team augmentees in order to provide a single, unified
   response from these organizations to the READY Review Board. After READY taskings are
   established by the READY Review Board, individual Associate Units will coordinate
   directly with TW APMs to designate personnel and accomplish required training.

    5.4. RPM will distribute initial allocations to senior enlisted assigned to the two parent
    organizations, equivalent representatives and READY Review Board. These allocations will
    be based on a fair share percentage, which is determined by dividing the total number of
    assigned E-1 through E-6 in each parent organization, by the sum of all assigned E-1 through
    E-6 in the two parent organizations. This percentage is then multiplied by the number of
    validated requests to determine the overall allocations for each parent organization. See
    Attachment 7 for sample fair share chart.
    5.5. RPM will determine and distribute group allocations to TW GAPMs for further
    distribution to SACs. Associate Unit senior enlisted representative on behalf of AFOTEC
    Det 5 CC will determine and distribute allocations to Associate Unit GAPM for further
    distribution to SACs.
    5.6. Units will provide required Security Force READY Augmentee trained personnel to
    fulfill Security Force Real-World Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Charlie and Delta.
    These Security Force READY Augmentees will not be required during non-real world
    contingency tasks.
    5.7. Exemptions are noted as follows:
       5.7.1. Security Forces (AFMAN 31-201 Volume 3, Flight Operations)
       5.7.2. Honor Guard (AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program)
