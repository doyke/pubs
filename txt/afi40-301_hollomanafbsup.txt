     or representative, will notify the FAO at 572-7061 of all incidents concerning
     maltreatment. After hours, 49 SFS/CC, or representative, will contact the ARE, (575)

     1.10.5. Obtain necessary information for reporting suspected or known child or spouse
     maltreatment and document this as a desk blotter entry and a Security Forces
     Management and Information System (SFMIS), Incident Report. Provide a copy of the
     SFMIS report to the FAP and the sponsor’s unit commander. The 49 SFS/CC will ensure
     a copy of the blotter and incident reports are sent to the 49 MDG/CC.
     1.10.6. Investigate applicable cases of family maltreatment according to AFI 31-206,
     Security Forces Investigations Program.            Notify Air Force Office of Special
     Investigation (AFOSI) of incidents of serious bodily injury and all incidents of reported
     child sexual maltreatment. Ensure a photographer is utilized in cases where victim’s
     injuries should be depicted by photograph in order to complete SFS investigations.
     Notification of significant findings will be reported to FAP.
  1.14. AF Members and Civilian Employees Mandatory Reporting:
     1.14.1. (Added) All military personnel or individuals affiliated with HAFB, its
     organizations and associates, including those who live in the civilian community, will
     report all identified incidents of suspected or known child or spouse maltreatment to the
     FAP, 572-7061. New Mexico State law mandates all personnel to report suspicion of
     child abuse and neglect to Children Youth and Families Division at 1-800-797-3260.
  4.5. Intervention.
     4.5.5. When the potential for continued maltreatment exists, or severity of maltreatment
     is such that a child’s environment could contribute to further injury, illness or imminent
     danger, steps will be taken immediately to secure the child’s safety. Whenever possible,
     removal of the offender should be the first consideration. Action should be coordinated
     between the Family Advocacy Officer, SJA, SFS, CYFD, and sponsor’s commander in
     accordance with Air Force guidelines and the civil laws of the State of New Mexico. The
     focus should always be on the child’s safety, and involved parties should be sensitive to
     the traumatic nature of such actions. After hours, contact the CYFD (800) 797-3260 for
     assistance with outside-the-home emergency placement of children when the active duty
     member cannot be removed from the home. These procedures shall be outlined in the
     MOU between HAFB and CYFD.
  4.7. Domestic Abuse Reporting Options.
     4.7.1. SARC will refer victims of family violence or sexual assault to the FAP (to
     include spouses or unmarried intimates).
