This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-30, Military Entitlements, and defines
procedures for management and control of Air Force Reserve unit members determined to be in the line
of duty (LOD) due to injury, disease, or illness as prescribed in AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct)
Determination, which may result in entitlement to incapacitation pay. This instruction further defines pro-
cedures for management and control of unit members on active duty under orders for a specified period of
31 days or more, who are incapacitated beyond the original termination point of the orders. It explains
entitlement to incapacitation pay and payment procedures, and entitlement to be continued on active duty
for the duration of the incapacitation or final disposition of the case. This instruction requires collecting
and maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by 37 U.S.C., Pay and Allow-
ances of the Uniformed Services. System of records notice FO35 AF MPO, Unit Assigned Personnel
Information.
The objective of the Reserve benefit system is to compensate, to the extent permitted by law, members of
the Air Force Reserve who experience incapacitation or loss of civilian earnings as a result of an injury,
illness, or disease incurred, re-injured or aggravated in the line of duty, and provide the required medical
and dental care associated with the incapacitation.

    strate a loss of earned civilian income as a direct result of a finalized in line of duty determination.

   the wing commander.
   3.4.14. Forwarding all initial and extension requests through the appropriate legal office for review
   (AF Form 1971). NOTE: If, after due diligence and prior coordination with the unit SJA, a unit JA
   cannot be reached and the request is for the initial 6-month period, the legal review may be bypassed.
   Block IV of the AF Form 1971 should state that the SJA could not be reached.
   3.4.15. Assisting all Air Force Reserve personnel in processing requests for incapacitation pay. Inca-
   pacitation pay requests for individual mobilization augmentees (IMA)/individual ready reserve (IRR)
   members generated at unit career enhancement offices are forwarded to HQ ARPC/DRSP for process-
   ing.

   office with a copy of the completed briefing.
   3.5.2. Advises members they must report to the RMU every 15 or 30 days to initiate AF Form 1971,
   Certification for Incapacitation Pay, if applying for loss of military income. The member may
   choose to be paid either on a 15 or 30 day period.
   3.5.3. When the member requests an extension of the initial 6-month period provides the career
   enhancement office with the member’s current medical status AFRC Form 137, Medical Status, and
   AF Forms 422 and 1971 if member is unfit for military duty. Ensures all questions on the medical sta-
   tus form are answered completely and the form signed by either the treating physician or an RMU
   physician.
   3.5.4. Reviews the member’s medical status every 30 days to monitor member’s progress and recom-
   mend Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) action to the MTF as soon as it is determined such action is
   necessary. RMU physician review is documented on SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical
   Care, and filed in the member’s medical record.
   3.5.5. Provides the career enhancement office with a final AF Form 1971 and AF Form 422 when the
   member becomes fit for military duty.
   3.5.6. Ensures blocks I and II of AF Form 1971 are completed, if requested, every 15 or 30 days for

NOTES:

     1. Member must have earnings and AF Form 1971 recertified to receive pay for each preceding 15
        or 30 day incapacitation pay period. Applicable documents must be submitted to appropriate
        career enhancement office for submission to the RPO to ensure payments are continuous.
        Advance submissions are not permitted since entitlement keys on member’s status after their pay-
        ment period has passed.
     2. When submitting a request for extension for incapacitation pay prior to the expiration of current
        entitlement, earnings statements from member/employer must be estimated. Upon Secretary of
        the Air Force approval, current statement may be required by the RPO to compute pay entitle-
        ment.
     3. Members incapacitated as a result of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated on active
        duty or inactive duty training, may have an interim line of duty determination issued by the
        appointing authority if an informal or formal line of duty determination cannot be finalized within
        7 days of the injury, illness, or disease. An interim line of duty determination only applies to the
        initial request for incapacitation pay.
     4. HQ AFRC/DPMB may request other records not listed in this instruction to verify eligibility to
        incapacitation pay.
     5. AF Form 422 is not required if member is requesting only loss of earned civilian income.

                                     SAMPLE MEDICAL BRIEFING

     1. I may receive medical care and treatment, including hospitalization and rehospitalization, only for
        the specific LOD injury, illness, or disease.
     2. I must request approval for civilian health care from my supporting active duty medical treatment
        facility (MTF) before receiving such medical treatment. If I don’t receive prior approval, I will
        then be responsible for payment of all bills incurred and the government may no longer be respon-
        sible for my LOD injury, illness, or disease if complications arise from obtaining unauthorized
        civilian medical treatment.
     3. I must report any changes in residence to my supporting customer service office and supporting
        medical unit as soon as possible.
     4. To determine my eligibility for incapacitation pay, I must first make a request to my supporting
        RMU or MTF and a military physician will complete Block II of AF Form 1971, Certification for
        Incapacitation Pay, for the preceding 15 or 30 day period. I understand that an AF Form 1971
        cannot be initiated until after a line of duty determination has been rendered in my favor or an
        interim line of duty determination has been approved by my wing commander and HQ AFRC/
        DPMB.
     5. AF Form 1971 completed for more than 1 month will require approval by my wing commander
        with full detailed explanation of why the form was not completed monthly.
     6. I am not fit for military duty while I have a 4 in my physical profile and will not participate in any
        Reserve activity for pay and/or point credit. When my physical profile contains any combination
        of 1, 2, or 3 with or without physical restriction, I will be considered fit for military duty. The fact
        that I cannot perform my special operational duties, that is, flying duties, marine diving duties,
        etc., has no bearing on my fitness for military duty.
     7. I must personally report to my RMU/MTF once every 30 days, or more frequently if so directed,
        and provide written medical documentation from my treating physician, updated since approval
        of my last AF Form 1971.
     8. I am entitled to travel pay only for all medical appointments and I must contact my unit for prepa-
        ration of travel orders.

  7. Any payments I receive based upon an interim line of duty determination is subject to 100 percent
      recoupment if the final determination is not in the line of duty.
  8. A request for extension of the initial 6-month incapacitation pay period must be approved by the
      Secretary of the Air Force. I must make application through my career enhancement office for
      extension of the initial 6-month incapacitation pay period.

      pacitation pay is being processed.
  10. Incapacitation pay is taxable income.
  11. I also understand that if I am in receipt of incapacitation payments I may not be eligible for wel-
      fare payments. If I receive both incapacitation and welfare payments, I will be required to reim-
      burse welfare payments to the welfare agency.
