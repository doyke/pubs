                                                                            Pages: 3

This instruction supplements AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. It describes the Air Force
Operational Reporting System (AFOREPS) support from the Columbus Air Force Base
Command Post. This instruction also details the support responsibilities of the Command Post to
various base agencies and vice versa. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and are disposed of in accordance with the AFRIMS Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS).

1. Operational Reporting (OPREP-3) reports provide higher headquarters information necessary
for timely operational decisions. Reports are briefed as applicable to the Secretary of Defense,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force
and Commander, Air Education and Training Command. It is imperative that information is
passed to the Command Post (CP) as soon as possible.

2. The Columbus AFB Command Post (14 FTW/CP) is the primary agency responsible for
OPREP-3 reports. All CP controllers are trained and certified in operational reporting and are
available to assist 24 hours a day at extension 7020/7021. All plans and instructions that deal
with any Air Force Operational Reporting System (AFOREPS) report must be coordinated with
the command post to ensure compliance with requirements. CP controllers will provide
guidance to the wing commander for all reportable incidents or mishaps. Controllers will use the
OPREP-3 Reports Matrix in AFI 10-206 and AETC Supplement 1 along with his or her
experience to determine if an OPREP-3 report is required; however, the wing commander or
designated representative is the final releasing authority for all operational reports.

2.1. The CP will thoroughly brief the wing commander on all incidents and mishaps IAW the
OPREP-3 Reports Matrix and provide the wing commander with AFOREPS guidance and

detailed information concerning the reportable incident. The CP responsibility is to provide the
wing commander with AFOREPS guidance and detailed information concerning the reportable
incident and to ensure the commander is aware of AFI 10-206 requirements.

2.2. Procedures will be established in this local directive to ensure AFOREPS inputs are
promptly submitted to the CP for up-channel reporting. It is the CP controllers’ responsibility to
create OPREP-3 reports by receiving timely and accurate information from the applicable units.

3. The following agencies are highly encouraged to maintain a current copy of AFI 10-206 and
applicable supplements: 14 FTW/SE, 14 FTW/PA, 14 OG/CC, 14 MSG/CC, 14 MDG/CC,
14 FTW/MX, 14 MDG/CC, all 14 OG Duty Desks and UCCs, 14 OG/SOF, 14 OG GCC, 14
CS/CC, Emergency Communications Center (combined Security Forces and Fire Department
agency), and 14 CES/CEX. It is recommended all base agencies maintain a current copy of AFI
10-206. Agencies will establish procedures to ensure timely and accurate information is
provided to the command post for up-channel reporting.

4. Objective criteria for determining whether an event or incident is reportable are provided in
the OPREP-3 Reports Matrix located in AFI 10-206 and AFI 10-206, AETC Supplement 1. A
commander should not, however, restrict reporting to these categories. The CP will apply the
criteria and make a recommendation to the wing commander.

4.1. The CP will submit an initial voice report to the AETC Command Center or to the Air
Force Service Watch Cell (AFSWC) as applicable, within 15 minutes of the incident. The initial
voice report informs higher headquarters that an incident is in progress. Do not delay voice
reporting to gather additional information. The CP will inform the AETC Command
Center/AFSWC that further information will be submitted in the record copy report.

4.2. The CP will gather as much information as possible before submitting the OPREP-3 voice
report. The CP will coordinate the report with the appropriate group commander. The CP will
then brief the wing commander, or designated representative, and obtain approval to submit the
OPREP-3 voice report. Upon approval, the CP will immediately up-channel the voice report to
AETC Command Center. The AETC Command Center will contact the Air Force Service
Watch Cell (AFSWC) and National Military Command Center (NMCC) as applicable.

4.3. A record copy report is required within one hour of the voice report regardless if the
incident has been terminated or completed. It is imperative that affected base agencies provide
the CP with as much information as possible in order to submit a detailed record copy report.
The record copy report will not be a repeat of the voice report. To ensure integrity with the 15-
minute voice requirement, additional information not included in the voice report must be added
to the record copy.

4.3.1. Agencies contacted by the CP must provide the requested information for the OPREP-3
report as soon as possible. This information is normally requested by AETC Command Center
or AFSWC and must be submitted in the record copy report. Agencies witness to the situation or
incident will obtain the following information and provide to the CP. Do not delay reporting to
attain the following basic information.
16 July 2009                    AFI 10-206_AETCSUP_14FTWSUP                                   3

4.3.1.1. Who? Indicate the grade, age, marital status, number of dependents, unit of assignment
and status (student, permanent party, TDY).

4.3.1.2. What? Clearly state what happened and what military activities are affected. Include
other pertinent factors such as weather, casualties and expected mission or news media impact.

4.3.1.3. When? Give a specific or approximate time or time period in local or ZULU time.

4.3.1.4. Why? Include causes, if available.

4.3.1.5. Where? Give location of incident (on or off base, building number or address) and
include activities housed or conducted in the building.

5. The CP is responsible for training commanders on operational reporting requirements in the
basic AFI and this supplement. The CP will coordinate OPREP-3 reporting requirements and
criteria with base agencies to ensure all events and incidents are promptly brought to the CP
attention. The CP will not enter into agreements with lateral agencies that dictate reporting
criteria in violation of the basic AFI and this supplement.

5.1. Wing, group and unit commanders will be trained quarterly (February, May, August and
November) by the command post. Training will be documented on an approved locally
generated form or e-mail read receipt and maintained in the reports binder for the duration of the
commander’s assignment.

6. If only one report is required to fully explain an incident, the report will be up-channeled as a
final report. If further OPREP-3 reports are required, the first record report will be labeled as an
initial report with subsequent reports being labeled follow-up or final. Subsequent reports for the
same incidents will add a sequence letter to the basic report numbers.

7. The command post will protect all sensitive information IAW AFI 33-332, The Privacy Act
Program. The command post will provide sensitive information on a strict need-to-know-basis
and will not put names and SSNs in any OPREP-3 report, IAW AFI 10-206 and AFI 10-206,
AETC Supplement 1. However, when requested, the command post will provide names and
social security numbers, via separate addendum, to the AETC Command Center or AFWSC after
submission of the voice report, IAW AFI 10-206 and AFI 10-206, AETC Supplement 1.
