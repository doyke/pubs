A1.1. Preparation of material to be destroyed.
   A1.1.1. Remove all paper clips and large staples, or any other metal fasteners (e.g., prong fasteners,
   binder clips, etc.). Heavy-duty staples are particularly bad for the machine--they will chip and dull
   blades quickly. Note: Pulverizer is for paper products and transparencies only. Additionally, do not
   shred recyclable paper that has no informational value such as PA, FOUO or classified information.
   These papers need to be placed in your units recycle bins. Also, never feed wet or greasy materials
   into the machine.

   classified material.

   A1.2.1. Turn on all circuit breakers. CAUTION: Remove neckties, rings, bracelets, necklaces and
   other items of jewelry and secure loose clothing.
   A1.2.2. If machine is opened with screen and blades exposed, close down by releasing safety latch
   located on the right side of the pulverizer and pull down. Tighten both hold down bolts firmly, but, not
   too tight. WARNING: Put on ear protectors before proceeding to next step.

   A1.2.5. DO NOT PUT MORE THAN ONE HALF (1/2) INCH OR APPROXIMATELY 85
   PAGES (8 ½ x 11) INTO THE FRONT FEED DOOR AT A TIME. IT ALSO HELPS TO
   LOOSELY SPREAD THE SHEETS OF PAPER. WAIT APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS
   AFTER EACH FEED BEFORE INSERTING MORE INTO MACHINE. FOR LEGAL SIZE
   PA P E R ( 8 ½ X 1 4 ) F E E D AT A R AT E O F 1 / 4 I N C H AT A T I M E A N D WA I T
   APPROXI-MATELY 45 SECONDS IN BETWEEN EACH FEED. KEEP FRONT FEED
   DOOR SHUT WHILE MACHINE IS SHEARING.

A1.3. Upon termination of shredding.
   A1.3.1. Once you finish all your documents, let machine run for approximately five to 10 minutes
   while you vacuum and clean the facility.
   A1.3.2. Once you finished your cleanup/cool down period turn off machine and ensure the blades
   have come to a complete stop. Keep the evacuation system blower on while you loosen the two bolts
   and bring the upper half of the pulverizer to the upright position. CAUTION: Make sure the latch on
   the right side of the machine is in a locked position.
   A1.3.3. Clean the grill with the small broom provided and also clean around the grill housing area.
   CAUTION: Ensure the blades are not in your way, so you will not get cut. Simply rotate the
   blades out of your way.

    A1.3.4. Check hopper, screen, between soundproof cover, between and under machine and the inte-
    rior and exterior of building 90613 to be sure no classified remains.
NOTE: If material remains on screen, reactivate blower and machine for times shown above. REPEAT
