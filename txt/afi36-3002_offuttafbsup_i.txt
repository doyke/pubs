         2.1.1.2.1. Hostile.
         2.1.1.2.2. Non-Hostile.

      in action (MIA), detained, captured, etc., for reporting to DoD.
   2.1.2. The CAR:
      2.1.2.1. Immediately telephones AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048
      (CONUS bases only) upon learning of a casualty and continues to provide casualty data
      updates until information is confirmed and a casualty report is submitted through DCIPS.

      processing guide and report information.
   2.1.5. Initial and Supplemental Casualty Reports:
      2.1.5.1. Casualty Reports are transmitted in an unclassified format.

   Paragraph 2.1.4.
      2.4.1.1. If a GSU or PERSCO Team does not have DCIPS reporting capability, report
      the information by telephone to the servicing FSS/MSS, who then submits the required
      Casualty Report using DCIPS.
   2.4.2. The CAR at the member's servicing FSS/MSS submits a supplemental report

2.7. Reporting Casualties on Military Aircraft or AMC Comme rcially Contracted
Aircraft:
   2.7.1. Reporting Requirements:
      2.7.1.1. The Air Force requires reports on all casualties resulting from a military or CMA
      aircraft incident or disappearance.
      2.7.1.2. The CAR/PERSCO must account for all personnel aboard the aircraft
      2.7.1.3. The proper reporting method depends on the nature of the incide nt and the
      number of casualties. In all incidents, immediately contact AFPC/DPWCS by telephone
      (DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048), if possible, to determine which of these methods to
      use:
          2.7.1.3.1. If the casualties are all NSI, report them immediately by telephone
          followed           by           a         Hasty         Casualty        Report
          (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyInfo for examples).
          2.7.1.3.2. If there are multiple casualties, make an initial report by telephone and
          follow it with a Hasty Casualty Report or a standard report as AFPC/DPWCS directs.
          2.7.1.3.3. If there were no reportable casualties, list the casualty status as ―None‖ for
          each person onboard and submit a Hasty Casualty Report.
          2.7.1.3.4. If telephone contact with AFPC/DPWCS cannot be made, the FSS/MSS
          commander or PERSCO team chief determines whether to use a Hasty or standard
          Casualty Report for initial reporting.
   2.7.2. Determining onboard crew and passengers. These documents and sources can help
   you determine onboard personnel:
      2.7.2.1. Crew: Review DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan. It shows the name, grade,
      SSN, crew position, and home installation of each crewmember.
      2.7.2.2. Passengers:
          2.7.2.2.1. Review available passenger manifests and other documentation from flight
          origination and stops en route. These contain information such as passengers' names,
          grades, SSNs, passport numbers, emergency addresses, and units of assignment.
          2.7.2.2.2. Consult passenger service terminals, base operations, flight control centers
          at civilian airports, and AMC Aerial Port Operations offices for information on
          passengers aboard military aircraft.
          2.7.2.2.3. If difficulties are encountered in obtaining the information, immediately
          contact AFPC/DPWCS by telephone (DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048) and they
          will request assistance from HQ AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center, Aerial Port
          Control Center (HQ AMC TACC/XOGC) (DSN 576-1755).
   2.7.3. Release of Casualty Information:. Crew and passenger names, and any other
   releasable information that would assist commanders in making casualty determinations, will
   be immediately released to the CAR/PERSCO. Installation commanders must be able to
   determine casualty status of their personnel using the information. See the local SJA if there
   are any questions.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                       41

Section 2B—Reports on Deceased Persons

2.9. Obtaining Conclusive Evidence of Death.
   2.9.1. The installation commander or the incident manager must obtain conclusive evidence
   before reporting the death of an individual.
   2.9.2. If more than one commander or Service is involved, they must coordinate their
   investigations and agree on their casualty status determinations:
      2.9.2.1. Do not submit a Casualty Report until all involved commanders agree on their
      determinations.
      2.9.2.2. If the commanders cannot reach an agreement, consult AFPC/DPWCS (DSN
      665-3505) for instructions.
   2.9.3. The Air Force does not require recovery of remains for conclusive evidence of death
   because situations will arise where remains cannot be recovered, but where the chance of
   survival is deemed impossible. The important factor is whether or not the commanders
   determine that survival is possible.
      2.9.3.1. The Air Force considers the following situations to be conclusive evidence of
      death:
          2.9.3.1.1. The commander determines death is the only plausible explanation for the
          member’s absence.
          2.9.3.1.2. Available information indicates beyond any reasonable doubt that an
          individual could not have survived. Such informatio n includes:
             2.9.3.1.2.1. Statements of witnesses to the incident.
             2.9.3.1.2.2. Circumstances of the incident.
             2.9.3.1.2.3. Search results.
             2.9.3.1.2.4. Local conditions of terrain, climate, water temperature and currents,
             etc.
          2.9.3.1.3. The total number of individual remains recovered from an aircraft or group
          accident equals the total number of persons known to be on board the aircraft or in the
          group, unless there is reasonable doubt:

              2.9.3.1.3.1. As to whether the remains are from the aircraft or group in question.
              2.9.3.1.3.2. Regarding the validity of the aircraft clearance and passenger
              manifest records.
2.10. Local Laws Governing Brain Death. The CAR must be aware of local laws governing
brain death, as they differ among states and countries. Submit death reports in accordance with
the local legal definition of brain death.

Section 2C—Reports on Members Declared DUSTWUN or Persons Declared Missing (Non-
Hostile and Hostile)

2.11. Declaring a Member DUSTWUN.
   2.11.1. DUSTWUN is a transitory casualty status applicable only to military personnel.
   2.11.2. The responsible unit or TDY commander declares a member DUSTWUN when the
   commander:
       2.11.2.1. Suspects a member's absence is involuntary and that the member may be a
       casualty.
       2.11.2.2. Does not feel there is sufficient evidence to make a definitive determination of
       missing (non- hostile), recommendation of missing (hostile), or deceased. DUSTWUN
       allows the commander time to gather additional facts and statements from witnesses in
       order to make a definitive status determination (non- hostile), or recommendation of
       missing (hostile).
   2.11.3. Once a commander declares a military member DUSTWUN, the CAR submits an
   initial     DUSTWUN           Report       (see        Paragraph         2.14        and
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyInfo ) to the addressees in Table 2.1 or Table
   2.2.
   2.11.4. Generally, commanders may not keep a member in DUSTWUN status for more than
   10 days, unless extended by AFPC/DPWCS (DSN 665-2909). During this period, the
   commander:
       2.11.4.1. Closely monitors the case and makes every effort to determine the member's
       true status.
       2.11.4.2. Receives the results of any search and investigative efforts.
       2.11.4.3. Submits daily Search Progress Reports (see Paragraph 2.15) to the addressees
       in Table 2.1 or Table 2.2.
2.12. Factors Commanders Should Consider in Determining Whether a Membe r's
Absence is Voluntary or Involuntary.
   2.12.1. Member’s relationship with others both on and off duty:
       2.12.1.1. Marital discord.
       2.12.1.2. Problems with supervisors or coworkers.
   2.12.2. Financial activities prior to or subsequent to disappearance:
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                       43

      2.12.3.1. Luggage or personal belongings missing from the member's residence.
      2.12.3.2. Remarks made by the member to friends, relatives, or coworkers hinting at the
      possibility of a departure.
2.13. Examples of When it May be Appropriate to Declare a Membe r DUSTWUN.
   2.13.1. An aircraft is overdue and the responsible commander has made an initial
   investigation, to include the following, with negative results:
      2.13.1.1. Checks of scheduled stops along route.
      2.13.1.2. Possible emergency landing sites.
      2.13.1.3. Other places the aircraft may have landed.
   2.13.2. A member disappears while participating in a recreational activity such as hunting,
   fishing, hiking, or camping:
      2.13.2.1. The member's commander initiates a search for the absent member and
      investigates the circumstances surrounding the member’s disappearance.
          2.13.2.1.1. The search must be sufficiently extensive for the commander to determine
          whether the member could freely return.
          2.13.2.1.2. Include Security Forces, local police, Air Force Office of Special
          Investigations (AFOSI), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other
          investigative agencies.
   2.13.3. Initial attempts to find the member fail and the commander determines the member is
   not AWOL.
   2.13.4. A member observes a lead aircraft as it is hit b y enemy ground fire. Before the
   aircraft hits the ground, the member observes a flash, possibly from a seat ejection.
   Hostilities preclude launching a search and rescue attempt.
   2.13.5. A member disappears and there are no known circumstances:
      2.13.5.1. Personal belongings such as military ID card, wallet, car keys, checkbook,
      passport, camera, television set, savings bonds, etc., are still in member’s dormitory room
      or private residence.
      2.13.5.2. First sergeant, supervisor and co-workers believe voluntary absence would be
      out of character for the member.
2.14. CAR Responsibilities for Filing DUSTWUN and Subsequent Reports.
   2.14.1. Once a commander declares a military member DUSTWUN:
      2.14.1.1. Immediately telephone AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048
      (CONUS bases only) and advise them of the commander’s decision.

          and has determined that there is conclusive evidence of death.
          2.17.3.4.5. Submission of the report does not automatically change the person's
          casualty status from missing to deceased. The Missing Persons Act requires a formal
          status review:
          2.17.3.4.6. Only AFPC/DPWCM may officially change the casualty status to
          deceased.
          2.17.3.4.7. AFPC/DPWCM notifies the NOK if the casualty status is changed to

   2.22.1. This casualty status applies to military members, DoD civilian employees, or DoD
   contractor employees.
   2.22.2. In those circumstances where the reason for a member’s absence is uncertain and it is
   possible that the member is a casualty whose absence is involuntary, but there is not
   sufficient evidence to determine immediately that the member is missing or deceased, the
   member should be designated DUSTWUN (Paragraphs 2.11 through 2.15) and the
   commander shall:
       2.22.2.1. Make a preliminary assessment of the circumstances. In circumstances where it
       is questionable whether the involuntary absence is a result of hostile action (or under

   2.28.1. The HASTY Casualty Reports are used to expedite the flow of casualty information
   to AFPC/DPWCS when multiple casualties are involved and submitting standard Casualty
   Reports would delay notifying the NOK.
   2.28.2. The HASTY Casualty Reports are used to:
      2.28.2.1. Give AFPC/DPWCS information for casualty accountability purposes.
      2.28.2.2. Help AFPC/DPWCS expedite notification without news media interference.
      2.28.2.3. Provide immediate information about an incident with potential mass

      nature of the incident and the number of casualties.
   2.29.2. Multiple Reportable Casualties:
      2.29.2.1. When multiple casualties make it difficult to submit standard reports in a timely
      manner using assigned casualty services personnel or a CAST, use t he appropriate
      Casualty Report to initially report casualties in DCIPS.
      2.29.2.2. When an incident occurs, the CAR/PERSCO immediately contacts
      AFPC/DPWCS by telephone at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048 for approval of
      abbreviated reporting.

      using the DCIPS Hasty Report.
          2.29.2.3.1. If you cannot submit a complete Casualty Report immediately due to
          delayed or missing information, then as soon as additional information becomes
          available submit a supplemental Casualty Report for the remaining items using the
          DCIPS Hasty Report.
      2.29.2.4. Once conditions permit, submit standard initial Death Reports (see
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyInfo ) to the personnel listed in accordance
      with Table 1.1.
      2.29.2.5. You must submit these standard reports, however, as applicable:

       Reports.
       2.29.2.7. Report the casualties requiring personal notification to the NOK first to give
       AFPC/DPWCS time to spin up notification teams.
          2.29.2.7.1. Give reports on deceased and missing persons priority.

EXCEPTION: If a Primary NOK contacts the installation, either in person or telephonically,
regarding a member’s well being and the Commander or First Sergeant has confirmed the death
of the member, the Commander or First Sergeant has an obligation to inform the Primary NOK
immediately after verification of the NOK’s identity and relationship to the member of his/her
status.
   3.2.2. For personnel in a VSI, SI, or NSI casualty status, the member, the attending

at no charge. DFAS-IN/JFLTBA is required by Title 37, U.S.C., Section 403, to make this
payment to eligible beneficiaries. Eligible NOK occupying government housing on the date the
member dies may continue to occupy such housing without charge for a period of 365 days. If
the NOK vacate the government housing before the 365 days are up, the BAH is paid for the
 90                                        AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


remaining unused days. NOTE: When unpaid pay and allowances are paid to a person other than
the member’s spouse, the CAR should apply for the BAH on behalf of the spouse.
4.13. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force to the
surviving spouse or, in some cases, eligible children of a member who dies on active duty in the
line of duty (LOD). The annuity is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to which the member
would have been entitled as if retired for total disability on the date of death. The spouse’s
annuity is reduced by the amount of the monthly Dependency and Indemnity Compensation
payment awarded and paid to the surviving spouse by the VA. The annuity is paid until the
spouse dies, but is suspended upon remarriage before age 55. The annuity to a surviving spouse
may be reinstated if the subsequent marriage ends in death or divorce. The annuitant must send a
certified copy of the divorce decree or death certificate to DFAS-CL (Defense Finance and
Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P.O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131) to
reinstate the annuity. If a second SBP benefit resulted from the remarriage, the surviving spouse
must elect which of the two SBP benefits to receive. Should the surviving spouse remarry at age
55 or older, the annuitant will continue to receive the monthly annuity. The surviving spouse
must notify DFAS of any changes in marital status. See AFI 36-3006, Survivor Benefit Plan
(SBP) for additional information.
   4.13.1. The CAR will fax the claim forms and any supporting documentation, as listed in
   Table 4.2, to AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-2348, and DFAS-CL at DSN 580-6321.
   4.13.2. For active duty deaths when the member is survived by both a spouse and child(ren)
   contact AFPC/DPSIAR (SBP Branch) at DSN 665-2274 for guidance in processing steps to
   establish appropriate annuity.
       4.13.2.1. AFPC/DPSIAR will process the active duty claim when the surviving spouse
       requests the SAF waive spouse SBP in favor of the member’s children. All required SBP
       documentation/forms must be forwarded to AFPC/DPSIAR.
   4.13.3. Surviving spouse must request the SAF pay SBP to either the spouse or the
   child(ren). All required SBP documentation/forms must be forwarded to AFPC/DPSIAR.
       4.13.3.1. CAR must ensure surviving spouse is properly counseled on his or her options
       regarding the receipt of SBP annuity for both spouse and child only coverage .
   4.13.4. The CAR must ensure the claim is processed and the annuity established prior to
   closing out the case. In some cases, the VA DIC entitlement will totally offset the SBP
   annuity. However, an annuity must be established regardless of the amount. There is a 6- year
   statute of limitations on filing an SBP claim. If a claim is not established within 6 years, there
   is no legal basis for establishing the claim. This is particularly important in cases when the
   VA DIC completely offsets the SBP annuity and the surviving spouse remarries after age 55
   but before age 57 when he or she loses DIC entitlement, but the SBP annuity can be
   reinstated.
4.14. Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP). RCSBP is a monthly annuity
paid by the Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some cases, eligible children of an Air
Reserve Component member who dies and has completed the satisfactory years of service to
qualify the member for retired pay at age 60. The member must have made an election within 90
days of notification of eligibility to participate in the program. Members on an active
Guard/Reserve 10211 (officer) or 12310 (enlisted) tour, are eligible to participate in the plan.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                         91


Coverage is not automatic unless the member dies before the 90-day period established by law.
The initial annuity paid to a surviving spouse is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to which
the member would have been entitled at age 60, reduced by the Reserve Portion Cost. See AFI
36-3006 for additional information.
   4.14.1. If the member meets the eligibility requirements, fax the claim forms and supporting
   documentation, as listed in Table 4.2, to AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-2348 and DFAS-CL at
   1-800-982-8459.
   4.14.2. Contact the base FSO to check on the payment status of the RCSBP annuity prior to
   checking with DFAS.
4.15. Montgomery GI Bill Death Benefit. The VA will pay a special Montgomery GI Bill
death benefit to a designated survivor in the event of the service-connected death of an individual
while on active duty. Service connection is determined by the VA using an AF 348, Line of Duty
Determination. The deceased must either have been entitled to educational assistance under the
Montgomery GI Bill program or a participant in the program who would have been so entitled
but for the high school diploma or length-of-service requirement. The amount paid will be equal
to the participant’s actual military pay reduction less any education benefits paid. If the member
contributed to this program, the designated SGLI beneficiary may be entitled to the death benefit.
The death benefit is paid to whoever is designated to receive the member’s SGLI. To apply for
the death benefit, the CAR should submit a letter or a Support of Claim along with the member’s
SGLI certificate (SGLV 8286), and a copy of the DD Form 1300 and AF 348, as listed in Table
4.2 to the VARO, St. Louis Regional Processing Officer, ATTN: Chapter 30, Montgomery GI
Bill, PO Box 66830, 331/225, St. Louis MO 63103-6830. See VAP 80-XX-1 for additional
benefit information. Any changes in benefits due to the inception of the Post 9/11 GI Bill will be
posted at : https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyInfo .*NOTE: The second two digits
represent the year of publication.
4.16. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). DIC is payable by the VA to
surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18, disabled children, children between the ages
of 18 and 23 if attending a VA-approved school, and low-income parents of members who die
from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated while on active duty or active duty for training,
an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while on inactive duty for training, or a
disability otherwise compensable under laws administered by the VA. DIC is not paid if the VA
determines that the member’s own misconduct contributed to the death. DIC paid to a surviving
spouse is not based on the member’s military pay grade. The amount paid for a spouse with one
or more children of the deceased is increased for each child. The amount of the DIC payment for
parents varies according to the number of parents, the amount of their individual or combined
total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live with a spouse. DIC
payments to a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse does not remarry prior
to age 57. Should the surviving spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but may be restored if
the subsequent marriage ends in death, divorce or annulment. See VAP 80-XX-1, for additional
information. CARs are required apply for DIC benefits in ALL death cases. *NOTE: The second
two digits represent the year of publication.
   4.16.1. To apply for DIC, the CAR should complete the appropriate claim application as
   listed in Table 4.2.
 92                                        AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


   4.16.2. Fax the original claim application and copies of any supporting documentation to
   (215) 381-3084. the VA Regional Office, P. O. Box 8079, Philadelphia, PA 19101. DIC
   claims for retirees who die within 120 days of retirement are processed through the VARO in
   Cleveland Ohio.
4.17. Non-service-Connected Death Pension. If the VARO determines that the NOK is not
eligible for DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected death pension.
Surviving spouses of deceased members with wartime service and unmarried children under age
18, or age 23 if attending a VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet
income limitations prescribed by law. Qualifying children who become incapable of self- support
because of a disability before age 18 may be eligible for a pension as long as the condition exists
unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds the income limit. The rate of pension
depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or child receives from other sources. A
pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable to assume the
estate will maintain them financially. The VA will determine their eligibility. See VAP 80-XX-1,
for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.
   4.17.1. Eligible survivors should visit their local VA office to complete the appropriate
   claim application with the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.2.
4.18. Serviceme mbe rs’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI). The SGLI payment is the maximum
allowable by law, unless the member elected a lesser amount or declined coverage in writing.
Monthly premium payments for the level of coverage selected by the member were
automatically deducted from the member’s pay. The Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life
Insurance (OSGLI) under the jurisdiction of the Department of VA makes determination and
payment of proceeds. The claim form required to apply for this benefit is VA Form SGLV 8283.
Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is exempt from taxation. The insured member may have
designated as principal or contingent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation or legal entity,
including his/her estate, individually or as a trustee. If the member designated a trust, he/ she
indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary block. If the member designated a trust
through a will, he/she annotated ―Last Will and Testament‖ in the beneficiary block. If the
member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds be paid in the
order of precedence, the member selected the ―By Law‖ designation.
   4.18.1. When the ―By Law‖ designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the
   following order of precedence:
       4.18.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
       4.18.1.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares,
       with the shares of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that
       child.

       surviving parent.
       4.18.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s
       estate.

4.19. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a
divorced spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of
the decedent under age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A
divorced spouse must have been married to the servicemember at least 10 years. Monthly
payments are also paid to children until age 18, 19 if a full-time student at a primary or
secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age 18. Spouses who wait until age 65 to
apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits. However, they can receive reduced Social
Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent parents are eligible for benefits at age 62
if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased servicemember for their support.
The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Administration, which has a
record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian
employment under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, the CAR should
contact the Expedited Claims Processing Center in Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon
as they obtain sufficient NOK information to establish the claim. This office will explain the
benefit, determine their eligibility, the amount to be paid, and contact the NOK directly if
additional documentation is required. The Expedited Claims Processing Center will establis h the
claim immediately based on the information provided by the CAR.
4.20. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a
lump sum death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time
of death. Separation because of military service, is considered living together. If there is no
surviving spouse, it is paid to the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security
benefits during the month of the member’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit.
This benefit is paid even if burial, funeral, or memorial benefits were paid by the Air Force. To
apply for this benefit, the CAR should contact the Expedited Claims Processing Center in
Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon as they obtain sufficient NOK information to

Claims Processing Center will establish the claim immediately based on the information
provided by the CAR.
4.21. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal
employees. Congress established the TSP in the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of
1986. The purpose of the TSP is to provide retirement income. The TSP offers Federal
employees the same type of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their
employees under "401(k)" plans. TSP regulations are published in title 5 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Parts 1600–1690, and are periodically supplemented and amended in the Federal
Register. On October 30, 2000. The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act was
signed; it extends participation in the TSP to members of the uniformed services, including the
Ready Reserve. Participation can be confirmed through the base FSO or by calling TSP at 1-877-

designated beneficiary named by the member prior to retirement. Normally, this amounts to the
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                        101

4.33. SBP. SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force. This program allows personnel who
retired on or after 21 September 1972, to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide a
monthly annuity to their beneficiaries after the death of the retiree. The retiree designates the
beneficiaries. Participation in this program is voluntary. SBP provides an eligible surviving
spouse or former spouse or, in some cases, eligible children financial security similar to the
financial security a retiree had in retired pay—a cost-of- living-adjusted monthly income for life.
See AFI 36-3006, for additional benefit information.
   4.33.1. If the retiree participated in SBP, fax the required claim forms and copies of any
   supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3 to AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-2348, and
   DFAS at 1-800-982-8459.

retiree designates the beneficiaries. The beneficiary choices are the same as for SBP.

4.35. DIC. DIC is payable by the VA to surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18,
disabled children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if attending a VA-approved school,
and low- income parents of retirees who die from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated while
on active duty or active duty for training, an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty
while on inactive duty for training, or a disability otherwise compensable under laws
administered by the VA. DIC is not paid if the VA determines that the retiree’s own misconduct
contributed to the death. The monthly DIC rate paid to a surviving spouse of a retiree for deaths
occurring after 1 January 1993 is the same for all pay grades. The DIC amount paid for a spouse
with one or more children of the deceased retiree is increased for each child. The amount of the
DIC payment for parents varies according to the number of parents, the amount of their
individual or combined total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live
with a spouse. DIC payments to a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse
does not remarry prior to age 57. Should the surviving spouse remarry, payments are terminated,
but may be restored if the subsequent marriage ends in death, divorce or annulment. See VAP
80-XX-1 for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of
publication.

   4.35.3. Remember, even if no one is eligible for DIC you should submit the appropriate
   claim application so the VA can determine if the death is service connected before DFAS-CL
   will pay the death gratuity.
   4.35.4. When the VARO makes a determination of service connection, fax the signed VA
   Rating Decision to AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-2348.
       4.35.4.1. The rating should contain the signature of the VA rating specialist, and the
       statement that basic eligibility for death gratuity, under Title 38, U.S.C., Chapter 35, is
       established.

       4.35.5.1. When assisting the spouse of a retiree who is in receipt of VA disability
       compensation, the spouse can receive the member’s final month’s VA disability
       compensation through the DIC application only.
4.36. Non-Service-Connected Death Pension. If the VARO determines that the NOK is not
eligible for DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected death pension.
Surviving spouses of deceased members with wartime service and unmarried children under age
18, age 23 if attending a VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet
income limitations prescribed by law. Qualifying children who become incapable of self- support
because of a disability before age 18 may be eligible for a pension as long as the condition exists,
unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds the income limit. The rate of pension
depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or child receives from other sources. A
pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable to assume the
estate will maintain them financially. T he VA will determine their eligibility. See VAP 80-XX-1
for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.
   4.36.1. To apply for a non-service-connected death pension, eligible survivors should visit
   their local VA office to complete the appropriate claim application and provide supporting
   documentation as listed in Table 4.3.
4.37. SGLI. Retirees are covered for 120 days following retirement with no additional premium
during the 120-day period. Retirees rated totally disabled on the date of retirement retain SGLI
coverage until the disability ceases to be total in degree, but not for more than 2 years.
Determination and payment of proceeds are made by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the
VA. Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is exempt from taxation. The insured member may
have designated as principal or contingent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation or legal
entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a trustee. If the member designated a trust,
he/she indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary block. If the member designated
a trust through a will, he/she annotated ―Last Will and Testament‖ in the bene ficiary block. If the
member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds be paid in the
order of precedence, the member selected the ―By Law‖ designation.
   4.37.1. When the ―By Law‖ designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the
   following order of precedence:
       4.37.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.

       4.37.1.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares,
       with the shares of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that
       child.

       surviving parent.
       4.37.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s
       estate.
       4.37.1.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws

A member who had a service-connected disability but was otherwise in good health could apply
to the VA for up to $10,000 in SDVI life insurance coverage at standard rates. Members rated
totally disabled by the VA could apply for a waiver of premiums. For those members eligible for
this waiver, additional coverage of up to $20,000 is available, but the premiums cannot be
waived. See VAP 80-XX-1, for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent

death benefit to a designated survivor if the death is determined to be in the LOD or within 1
year after discharge or release. The deceased must either have been entitled to educational
assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill program or a participant in the program who would
have been so entitled but for the high school diploma or length-of-service requirement. The
amount paid will be equal to the participant’s actual military pay reduction less any educatio n
benefits paid. The death benefit is paid to the SGLI beneficiary. The CAR should submit a letter,
along with the member’s SGLV 8286 listing the beneficiary, and a copy of the DD Form 1300

4.40. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a
divorced spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of
the decedent under age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A
divorced spouse must have been married to the servicemember at least 10 years. Monthly
payments are also paid to children until age 18, or 19 if a full-time student at a primary or
secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age 18. Spouses who wait until age 65 to
apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits. However, they can receive reduced Social
Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent parents are eligible for benefits at age 62
if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased servicemember for their support.
The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Administration, which has a
record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian
employment under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, the CAR should
contact the ―Expedited Claims Processing Center‖ in Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as
soon as they obtain sufficient NOK information to establish the claim. This office will explain
the benefit, determine their eligibility, the amount to be paid, and contact the NOK directly is
additional documentation is required. The ―Expedited Claims Processing Center‖ will establish
the claim immediately based on the information provided by the CAR.
4.41. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a
lump sum death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time
of death. Separation because of military service, is considered living together. If there is no
surviving spouse, it is paid to the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security
benefits during the month of the member’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit.
This benefit is paid even if burial, funeral, or memorial benefits were paid by the Air Force. To
apply for this benefit, the CAR should contact the ―Expedited Claims Processing Center‖ in
Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon as they obtain sufficient NOK information to

Claims Processing Center‖ will establish the claim immediately based on the information
provided by the CAR.
4.42. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal
employees. Congress established the TSP in the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of
1986. The purpose of the TSP is to provide retirement income. The TSP offers Federal
employees the same type of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their
employees under "401(k)" plans. TSP regulations are published in title 5 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Parts 1600–1690, and are periodically supplemented and amended in the Federal
Register. On October 30, 2000. The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act was
signed; it extends participation in the TSP to members of the uniformed services, including the
Ready Reserve. Participation can be confirmed through the base FSO or by calling TSP at 1-877-

benefit will be paid to whoever is designated beneficiary. To apply for the death benefit the CAR

4.53. Unpaid Pay and Allowances for Retirees. The retirement pay of an Air Force member
stops on the day the retiree dies. Upon the death of a retired member, any pay and allowances
due but not paid to the member are paid to the designated beneficiary named by the member
prior to retirement. Normally, this amounts to the retirement pay from the first day of the month
of death through the date of death. Retirement pay electronically deposited into an account held
by a retiree will automatically be recouped by DFAS-CL and reissued to the beneficiary for the
correct amount.
   4.53.1. When the designated beneficiary is deceased, or if the member elected ―order of
   precedence,‖ any money due is paid to the first eligible recipient in the following order:
       4.53.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
       4.53.1.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares,
       with the share of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that
       child.
       4.53.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the
       surviving parent.

       Table 4.3, to DFAS-CL at 1 800-469-6559.
       4.53.2.2. When unpaid pay and allowances are divided, the base with primary assistance
       responsibility submits all claim forms in one package.
4.54. Retired Serviceman’s Family Protection Plan (RSFPP). The RSFPP program allowed
personnel who retired before 21 September 1972 to receive reduced retired pay in order to
provide an annuity for certain beneficiaries after the death of the retiree. Participation in this
program was voluntary. See AFI 36-3006, for additional information.
 112                                       AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011

   in Paragraph 4.55 or 4.56.
4.55. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force. This
program allows personnel who retired on or after 21 September 1972, or before if they enrolled
in the program during an open season, to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide a
monthly annuity to their beneficiaries after the death of the retiree. The retiree designates the
beneficiaries. Participation in this program is voluntary. SBP provides an eligible surviving
spouse or former spouse or, in some cases, eligible children, financial sec urity similar to the
financial security a retiree had in retired pay—a cost-of- living-adjusted monthly income for life.
See AFI 36-3006 for additional information.
   4.55.1. If the retiree elected to participate in SBP, follow the applicable instructions listed in
   Paragraph 4.55 or 4.56.
4.56. Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP). RCSBP is a monthly annuity
paid by the Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some cases, eligible children, of an Air
Reserve Component member who dies and has completed the satisfactory years of service to
qualify the member for retired pay at age 60. The retiree designates the beneficiaries. The
beneficiary choices are the same as for SBP. Participation in the program is voluntary. See AFI
36-3006 for additional benefit information.
   4.56.1. The three options that were available to the member at time of election are:
       4.56.1.1. Option A. Member declines to make an election until age 60. If death occurs
       prior to age 60, no annuity is payable.
       4.56.1.2. Option B. Coverage provides for an annuity to begin on the 60th anniversary of
       member’s birth, if death occurs before age 60, or to begin immediately when death occurs
       after age 60.
       4.56.1.3. Option C. Coverage provides for an annuity to begin immediately, whether
       death occurs before or after age 60.

   Paragraph 4.65 or 4.66.
   4.56.3. Fax the claim forms and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
   4.3, to DFAS-CL at 1 800 982-8459.
   4.56.4. Contact the base FSO to check on the payment status of the RCSBP annuity prior to
   checking with DFAS.
4.57. Processing RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP Annuities at Installations With Defense Retiree
and Annuitant Pay System (DRAPS) Access.
   4.57.1. Payment should begin within 30 days of the death notification date. The CAR and
   FSO must process the annuity in time to meet this goal.
   4.57.2. If the retiree participated in RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP, the CAR should:
       4.57.2.1. Inform the local FSO of a confirmed death.
       4.57.2.2. Give the FSO the retiree’s name, SSN, date of retirement, grade, and date of
       death.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                      113


   4.57.3. The FSO should give the CAR information on the deceased's retired pay and
   beneficiary’s annuitant pay.
   4.57.4. Within 10 workdays, the CAR should obtain from the NOK the required claim forms
   and supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3, and provide them to the base FSO for
   processing:
       4.57.4.1. When RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP is divided between more than one child, and
       they do not reside together, the assisting CARs send all documentation using overnight
       mail service, to the CAR with primary assistance responsibility who will then submit all
       claim applications in one package to the FSO.
       4.57.4.2. Fax all claim forms and supporting documentation directly to DFAS-CL at 1-
       800-982-8459.
   4.57.5. The local FSO:
       4.57.5.1. Determines the need for additional documents, depending on data already in
       DRAPS, and advises the CAR accordingly.
       4.57.5.2. Advises the CAR if security restrictions or questionable entitlements prevent
       DFAS from processing the annuity package.
4.58. Processing RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP Annuities at Installations Without DRAPS
Access.
   4.58.1. When the casualty assistance base does not have DRAPS access, claim applications
   for RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP, with supporting documentation, should be submitted directly to
   DFAS for processing.
   4.58.2. Payment should begin within 30 days of the death notification date. The CAR and
   DFAS should process the annuity in time to meet this goal.
   4.58.3. The CAR must inform DFAS by telephone at DSN 580-6153 or 1-800-321-1080 of a
   confirmed death on the same day the CAR is notified.
   4.58.4. When informed of the death, DFAS-CL/FRCAE immediately gives the CAR
   information relative to the retired pay account of the deceased, to include RSFPP or SBP
   election, allotments, net pay, VA and retirement pay, and beneficiary data.
   4.58.5. The CAR contacts the NOK to arrange a personal visit to complete the claim forms
   and obtain the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3 to establish the account.
       4.58.5.1. The CAR should consider the wishes of the NOK when arranging an assistance
       visit.
   4.58.6. Within 10 workdays of being notified of the death, the CAR Faxes the claim forms
   along with copies of any supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3, to DFAS-CL at 1
   800-982-8459.
4.59. DIC. DIC is payable by the VA to surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18,
disabled children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if attending a VA-approved school,
and low- income parents of retirees who die from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated while
on active duty or active duty for training, an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty
while on inactive duty for training, or a disability otherwise compensable under laws
 114                                       AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


administered by the VA. DIC payments may also be authorized for the survivor of a retiree who
had a service-connected total disability at the time of death but whose death was not the result of
his/her service-connected disability. The survivor qualifies if the retiree was continuously rated
totally disabled for a period of 10 or more years immediately preceding death, or the retiree was
so rated for a period of not less than 5 years from the date of discharge from military service.
Payments under this provision are subjected to offset by the amount received from judicial
proceedings brought on account of the retiree’s death. DIC is not paid if the VA determines that
the retiree’s own misconduct contributed to the death. The monthly DIC rate paid to a sur viving
spouse of a retiree for deaths occurring after 1 January 1993 is the same for all pay grades. The
DIC amount paid for a spouse with one or more children of the deceased retiree is increased for
each child. The amount of the DIC payment for parents varies according to the number of
parents, the amount of their individual or combined total annual income, and whether they live
together or, if remarried, live with a spouse. DIC payments to a surviving spouse are payable for
life, as long as the spouse does not remarry prior to age 57. Should the surviving spouse remarry,
payments are terminated, but may be restored if the subsequent marriage ends in death, divorce
or annulment. See VAP 80-XX-1* for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits
represent the year of publication.
   4.59.1. To apply for DIC complete the appropriate claim application as listed in Table 4.3.
   4.59.2. Mail the original claim application and copies of any supporting documentation, as
   listed in Table 4.3, to the VARO.
4.60. Non-Service-Connected Death Pension. If the VA Regional Office (VARO) determines
that the NOK is not eligible for DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected
death pension. Surviving spouses of deceased members with wartime service and unmarried
children under age 18, age 23 if attending a VA-approved school, may be eligible for this
pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law. Qualifying children who become
incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be eligible for a pension as
long as the disability exists, unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds the income
limit. The rate of pension depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or child
receives from other sources. A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is
reasonable to assume the estate will maintain them financially. The VA will determine their
eligibility. See VAP 80-XX-1* for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits
represent the year of publication.
   4.60.1. To apply for a non-service-connected death pension, eligible survivors should visit
   their local VA office to complete the appropriate claim application as listed in Table 4.3.
   4.60.2. Survivors will need to provide the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.
4.61. SGLI. Retirees rated totally disabled on the date of retirement retain SGLI covera ge until
the disability ceased to be total in degree, but not for more than 2 years. Determination and
payment of proceeds are made by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the VA. Payment of
proceeds to a beneficiary is exempt from taxation. The insured member may have designated as
principal or contingent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation or legal entity, including his/her
estate, individually or as a trustee. If the member designated a trust, he/she indicated the name
and date of the trust in the beneficiary block. If the member designated a trust through a will,
he/she annotated ―Last Will and Testament‖ in the beneficiary block. If the member chose not to
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                         115


designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds be paid in the order of precedenc e, the
member selected the ―By Law‖ designation.
   4.61.1. When the ―By Law‖ designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the
   following order of precedence:
       4.61.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
       4.61.1.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares,
       with the shares of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that
       child.
       4.61.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the
       surviving parent.
       4.61.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s
       estate.
       4.61.1.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws
       of the state in which the member was domiciled.
   4.61.2. For additional information on beneficiaries, see Paragraph 8.8 of this AFI and VA
   Handbook, for additional information.
   4.61.3. If the retiree was covered under SGLI, complete the claim form as listed in Table
   4.3.
   4.61.4. Fax the claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
   4.3, to OSGLI, at 1-877-832-4943.
4.62. Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI). This program allows retirees, upon
retirement, to convert their SGLI coverage during the first 120 days following retirement, or 1
year following retirement for totally disabled retirees. VGLI is a 5- year renewable term policy,
administered by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the VA. VGLI is issued up to the maximum
allowed by law for SGLI, but not for more than the amount of SGLI the retiree had in force at
the time of retirement.
   4.62.1. See the Servicemembers’ and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance Handbook , for
   additional information.
   4.62.2. If the retiree was covered under VGLI, complete the claim form as listed in Table
   4.3.
   4.62.3. Fax the claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
   4.3, to OSGLI, at 1 877 832-4943.
4.63. Service Disabled Veterans Insurance (SDVI). SDVI is life insurance limited to veterans
who left the Service after 24 April 1951. A member who had a service-connected disability but
was otherwise in good health could apply to the VA for up to $10,000 in SDVI life insurance
coverage at standard rates. Members rated totally disabled by the VA could apply for a waiver of
premiums. For those members eligible for this waiver, additional coverage of up to $20,000 is
available, but the premiums cannot be waived. See VAP 80-XX-1* for additional information.
*NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.

4.65. Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) and Montgome ry GI Bill
Refunds. The VA will pay a special death benefit to a designated survivor in the event of the
service-connected death of an individual within 1- year after discharge or release. The deceased
must either have been entitled to educational assistance under these programs or a participant in
the programs who would have been so entitled but for the high school diploma or length-of-
service requirement. The amount paid will be equal to the participant’s actual military pay
reduction less any education benefits paid. If the retiree contributed to these programs, the NOK
may be entitled to the death benefit. The death benefit is paid to the SGLI beneficiary. The CAR
should submit a letter, along with the SGLI Certificate (SGLV 8286) and a copy of the DD Form
1300 as listed in Table 4.3, to the appropriate VARO listed below. See VAP 80-XX-1*, for

4.66. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a
divorced spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of
the decedent under age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A
divorced spouse must have been married to the servicemember at least 10 years. Monthly
payments are also paid to children until age 18, 19 if a full-time student at a primary or
secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age 18. Spouses who wait until age 65 to
apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits. However, they can receive reduced Social
Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent parents are eligible for benefits at age 62
if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased servicemember for their support.
The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Administration, which has a
record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian
employment under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, eligible survivors
should make application through the nearest Social Security Office. This office will explain the
benefit, determine their eligibility, the amount to be paid, and help them complete the required
claim forms. Survivors should apply early, as the law generally permits retroactive payments of
only 12 months. Survivors will need to provide supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.
4.67. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a
lump sum death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time
of death. Separation because of military service, is considered living together. If there is no
surviving spouse, it is paid to the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security
benefits during the month of the member’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit.
This benefit is paid even if burial, funeral, or memorial benefits were paid by the Air Force. To
receive this benefit, eligible survivors must make application through the nearest Social Security
Office. This office will explain the benefit, determine their eligibility, the amount to be paid, and
help them complete the required claim forms. Survivors will need to provide supporting
documentation as listed in Table 4.3.
4.68. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal
employees.Congress established the TSP in the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of
1986. The purpose of the TSP is to provide retirement income. The TSP offers Federal
employees the same type of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their
employees under "401(k)" plans. TSP regulations are published in title 5 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Parts 1600–1690, and are periodically supplemented and amended in the Federal
Register. On October 30, 2000. The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act was
signed; it extends participation in the TSP to members of the uniformed services, including the
Ready Reserve. Participation can be confirmed through the base FSO or by ca lling TSP at 1-877-
968-3778 to report the death of the member. If the member contributed to this program, the death
benefit will be paid to whoever is designated beneficiary. To apply for the death benefit the CAR
should submit the TSP Form 17 (available at http://www.tsp.gov), civilian death certificate. and
fax to (703) 592-0170.
4.69. Other Assistance. The CAR addresses these other matters:

       Forces Agreements, they may have to live independently of the overseas installation.
       4.69.2.2. Summarize the relevant information on the AF Form 58.
   4.69.3. Fraudulent claims. The CAR should:
       4.69.3.1. Refer the NOK to the SJA when there are possible fraudulent claims against the
       deceased member's estate.
       4.69.3.2. Advise them to refer any suspicious requests for money to the executor of the
       deceased member's estate.

       4.69.5.1. Tell the NOK they might need copies of the civilian death certificate in the
       future.
       4.69.5.2. Explain that the Air Force is not authorized to purchase the death certificate for
       the NOK.
       4.69.5.3. Provide the cost of the document and the address of the State Vital Statistics
       Office or Health Department.
       4.69.5.4. Refer the NOK to the funeral director for assistance in obtaining copies of the
       death certificate.
4.70. Additional Casualty Assistance Visits or Contacts: The CAR should:
   4.70.1. Contact the NOK of a deceased retiree at least once every:
       4.70.1.1. Thirty days for the first 2 months after a retiree’s death.
       4.70.1.2. Sixty days thereafter until the NOK receives all benefits or the case is closed.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                         119


   4.70.2. Make contact via letter at the six, 12, 18, and 24 month anniversaries of the death in
   addition to other contact based on problems encountered and the NOK’s desires.
   4.70.3. Monitor the case for receipt of DIC, unpaid pay and allowances, RSFPP, SBP, or
   RCSBP and Social Security Administration entitlements.
   4.70.4. It is mandatory that CARs apply for DIC in each case. If local VA or service
   agencies are not available, it is your responsibility to ensure the NOK applies when
   appropriate.
   4.70.5. When making contact with the NOK:
      4.70.5.1. Give the NOK additional advice regarding benefits, if necessary, and help them
      file claims and applications.
      4.70.5.2. Ask about the status of benefit claims or applications already processed and
      offer to help expedite settlement, if applicable.
      4.70.5.3. Return one-of-a-kind documents (i.e., marriage or birth certificate, or divorce
      decree) to the NOK in person if possible or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
      4.70.5.4. Annotate each contact with the NOK, and summarize relevant information on
      the AF Form 58, using Attachment 9.
4.71. Administrative Closing of Casualty Assistance Cases.
   4.71.1. Closing casualty assistance cases is only an administrative action for control of
   records. It does not preclude further assistance to the NOK, such as appealing denials of
   benefits.
   4.71.2. The CAR follows these procedures:
      4.71.2.1. Close retiree cases, regardless of the installation’s DRAPS capability, 6 months
      after learning of the retiree’s death, on AF Form 58.
      4.71.2.2. If benefits applied for are denied or delayed by other than an Air Force agency,
      continue to monitor these applications until a final determination has been made.
      4.71.2.3. E- mail the error- free AF Form 58 to AFPC/DPDXIDL, within 5 workdays after
      learning the NOK has received all benefits and entitlements in blocks 10A through 10J as
      appropriate, or a final determination has been made (see Attachment 9). E-mail address
      is: afpc.dpdxidl@randolph.af.mil.
          4.71.2.3.1. The first page of the AF Form 58 is mandatory. The assista nce summary
          on the reverse is optional.
          4.71.2.3.2. Retain a copy of the entire form in the case file at least until the final 24-
          month letter is accomplished.
          4.71.2.3.3. Ensure all items on the form are properly completed and dates are
          recorded accurately.
          4.71.2.3.4. Ensure items 13 and 14 are signed and dated by the CAR.
          4.71.2.3.5. If more than one installation provided assistance, make sure other NOK
          or persons designated beneficiaries applied for and received the benefits.
 120                                       AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


          4.71.2.3.6. Keep proof of e- mail transmission to AFPC/DPDXIDL on file with the
          signed AF Form 58 in the case file.
4.72. Maintenance of Casualty Assistance Case Files:
   4.72.1. Maintain casualty assistance case files in accordance with AFI 33-364.
   4.72.2. Establish case files for each casualty and file them alphabetically.
   4.72.3. Case files must contain:
       4.72.3.1. A chronological record of contacts, listed on AF Form 58, in item 11, with:
          4.72.3.1.1. NOK.
          4.72.3.1.2. Other NOK and persons designated as beneficiaries, if applicable.
          4.72.3.1.3. Other government agencies.
          4.72.3.1.4. Civilian agencies.
       4.72.3.2. CAR’s actions on behalf of the NOK.
       4.72.3.3. Copies of all messages, memorandums, and claim forms sent to other agencies
       and the NOK.
       4.72.3.4. Any other relevant documents.
   4.72.4. Installations reporting casualties only. Installations reporting retiree deaths but
   having no assistance responsibilities should establish an interim case file for each casualty
   reported, and destroy the case file 6 months after the date of death (AF RDS, table 36-03,
   rule 02.00).
4.73. Disposition of Casualty Assistance Case Files. All Air Force records created are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363 and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Disposition located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims /.
4.74. Processing RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP Annuity Payment When a Retiree Is Missing. An
SBP beneficiary may apply for an annuity if the participa ting member’s retired pay has been
suspended because the member is missing.
   4.74.1. See Paragraph 4.52 through 4.54 for RSFPP and SBP information.
   4.74.2. DFAS-CL suspends a missing retiree's retired pay, but the CAR may begin
   processing annuity claims if the retiree is an RSFPP or SBP participant. NOTE: This
   procedure is not officially casualty assistance because there is no legal determination of
   death.
   4.74.3. Due to the unique circumstances of these cases, the CAR should immediately
   telephone AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048 for guidance on each case.
   4.74.4. Because it is not officially casualty assistance, do not start a case file or track annuity
   payment.
   4.74.5. If requested, the CAR helps the beneficiary collect and submit evidence that:
       4.74.5.1. The retiree has been missing for at least 30 days.
       4.74.5.2. A reasonable person would conclude that the retiree is dead.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                        121


      4.74.5.3. Such evidence must include:
          4.74.5.3.1. A statement signed by the applicant describing the circumstances of the
          retiree's disappearance.
          4.74.5.3.2. Supporting documents such as:
              4.74.5.3.2.1. A police missing person report.
              4.74.5.3.2.2. Signed statements from persons who last saw the retiree alive.
              4.74.5.3.2.3. A detailed description of the geographical location, local weather
              conditions, and the mental and physical condition of the retiree, with a statement
              regarding the retiree's chance of surviving—preferably prepared by a legal
              counsel or other qualified individual such as a forest ranger.
   4.74.6. DFAS/GC determines whether to start RSFPP or SBP annuity payments. A decision
   to begin payments does not constitute a legal determination of death.
   4.74.7. The date the Air Force suspended retired pay will be considered the date of death for
   payment purposes.
   4.74.8. If the retiree participated in RSFPP or SBP, the CAR:
      4.74.8.1. Completes the claim forms as listed in Table 4.3.
      4.74.8.2. Fax the claim forms, with copies of any supporting documentation as listed in
      Table 4.3, to DFAS-CL at 1-800-982-8459.
   4.74.9. Contacts the base FSO to check on the payment status of the RSFPP or SBP annuity
   prior to checking with DFAS.
   4.74.10. If the Air Force later declares the retiree deceased, the CAR performs the
   appropriate casualty reporting and assistance.

                                         Chapter 6

       AIR NATIONAL GUARD AND UNITED STATES AIR FORCE RESERVE

6.1. General Information. This chapter outlines the responsibilities and procedures for
reporting the deaths of ANG and USAFR members in a non-duty status, retired members
awaiting pay at age 60 and assisting their surviving NOK.
   6.1.1. Usually a surviving NOK notifies the member's assigned unit of the member's death.
   6.1.2. In the unusual case where the NOK is not aware of the member's death, the member's
   commander notifies the NOK in person.
6.2. Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. Commander of the unit notified of the member's death should:
       6.2.1.1. Determine the member's unit of assignment or other participation or
       nonparticipation status information. NOTE: HQ ARPC/DPPE will give you the member's
       unit of assignment if you provide the member's SSN. Call DSN 926-6438 or 1-800-525-
       0102 and ask for the Entitlements Branch.
       6.2.1.2. Notify AFPC/ DPWCS by telephone at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048 of
       ANG and USAFR casualties if the member was in a duty status (e.g., ADT, IDT, MPA,
       RPA, etc.).
       6.2.1.3. Prepare the initial Death Message. NOTE: All messages will be sent using the
       Defense Casualty Information Processing System (DCIPS).
   6.2.2. AFPC/DPWCS notifies the appropriate ANG state headquarters using contact lists
   provided by NGB/A1PS or HQ ARPC/DPPE.
   6.2.3. Member's unit commander should:
       6.2.3.1. Ensure that the FSS/MSS submits the initial Death Message (see
       https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyInfo ), within 24 hours of learning of the
       member’s death.
       6.2.3.2. Make every effort to notify the NOK in person, if they are not aware of the
       member's death.
       6.2.3.3. Help the NOK apply for benefits.
       6.2.3.4. Ensure the FSS/MSS prepares and distributes documentation (see Paragraphs
       5.17 through 5.24 on deaths from injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated while the
       member was in a duty status). FSS/MSS servicing the member's assigned unit should:
           6.2.3.4.1. Contact the Services Squadron Mortuary Officer or NCO in accordance
           with AFI 34-501, Mortuary Affairs Program, to determine eligibility for mortuary
           benefits.
           6.2.3.4.2. Help commanders with casualty services, including the preparation of
           initial and supplemental Death Reports.
           6.2.3.4.3. Forward documents in accordance with Table 6.1.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                       145


          6.2.3.4.4. Obtain a statement from the investigating authority if a beneficiary was or
          might have been involved in the member’s death and send it to HQ ARPC/DPSPE.
          6.2.3.4.5. Develop written casualty reporting instructions.
6.3. Reporting Casualties.
   6.3.1. Submit         an          initial          death            message                (see
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyInfo ), to addressees listed in Table 6.1.
      6.3.1.1. Within 24 hours (active duty status) or next duty day (non-duty status or retiree)
      of learning of the member’s death, the member's assigned unit at the time of death
      prepares the initial message.
          6.3.1.1.1. Guard unit representative immediately contacts the unit command post,
          which in turn will contact the ANG Readiness Center’s Operations Center
          (ANG/A3XC) at DSN 858-6001, or by fax at DSN 858-7505.
      6.3.1.2. For participating and nonparticipating Reserve members and Retired Reserve
      awaiting pay at age 60, the commander of the unit notified of the member’s death, or the
      unit nearest the place of death, prepares necessary messages, forwards appropriate
      documents, and provides casualty assistance.
      6.3.1.3. For Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), the commander of the
      member’s attached unit forwards appropriate documents to HQ AFRC /RMG and HQ
      AFRC/A1KP and provides casualty assistance.
      6.3.1.4. If you don’t have all the necessary data, the member’s commander asks the Air
      Force unit or installation nearest the place of death to verify the death and furnish all
      relevant data to unit or base Casualty Assistant Representative.
      6.3.1.5. Units and installations receiving requests for data must send it to the member's
      commander as soon as possible.
      6.3.1.6. Follow these steps to report the death of an ANG or USAFR general officer:
          6.3.1.6.1. Immediately telephone AFPC/ DPWCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-
          0048.
          6.3.1.6.2. For ANG, contact the ANG/A3XC at DSN 858-6001.
          6.3.1.6.3. For USAFR, contact HQ USAF/RESOMO at DSN 332-3245 and HQ
          ARPC/DPPE at DSN 926-6438.
          6.3.1.6.4. Follow up with a supplemental death message (RCS: DD P&R (AR) 1664
          (see https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyInfo).
6.4. Providing Casualty Assistance.
   6.4.1. The closest full- time civilian CAR should take the primary role with the
   Reserve/Guard CAR as back up. Together the team will help the NOK do the following :
      6.4.1.1. Complete and submit applications for monetary benefits and other privileges.
      6.4.1.2. Assist in locating resources to help resolve any problems in settling the
      deceased's estate and any complaints from the NOK.

8.3. Minimum Counseling Information for Membe rs Making SGLI Elections.
   8.3.1. Special counseling is required by Title 38, United States Code, Section 1967(d). This
   counseling is intended to inform members of their insurance benefits, the rationale behind
   those benefits, and the general availability of commercial alternatives. It is intended to
   stimulate consideration of personal insurance requirements in the context of overall estate
   planning. General, not detailed or comprehensive, information is required by this provision
   of law. The required counseling should be conducted at the time initial SGLI coverage is
   elected, even if the automatic maximum level of coverage is retained, and upon the occasion
   of any election to increase or decrease the level of SGLI coverage in effect. The following
   information will be provided as a minimum:
   8.3.2. Purpose and role of life insurance. Life insurance can serve a number of purposes, but
   the principal role is to ease the financial burden imposed on survivors when a member dies
   before achieving the financial strength needed to cover the expenses associated with death
   and any associated loss of income to those financially dependent on the member. Since
   everyone eventually dies, many people plan to become financially secure by a certain age.
   This is achieved through a savings or investment program. Generally, persons with a family
   require more insurance during the period of time their family is young. Extra money would
   be needed to meet childcare, education, and personal expenses for their dependent children.
   Thus, as their children reach adulthood, their future expenses begin to diminish while their
   financial strength has increased. As a result, they may need less insurance, having reached a
   point of long-term financial stability.
   8.3.3. Term insurance versus whole life insurance. There are several types of life insurance,
   but the two principal types are term and whole life. Term insurance covers a limited period of
   time while whole life covers an indefinite period, or the insured person’s whole life. While
   term insurance may be renewable past the established period of coverage, premiums for the
   new period will likely be increased to cover the higher risk of death as the insured person
   gets older. Thus, while people are young, premiums for term insurance are generally low, but
   can be expected to increase substantially for persons age 60 to 70. Many term policies stop at
   age 70 or thereabouts. Because the life expectancy for Americans is in the range of 70 to 80
   years of age, many people strive to achieve long-term financial stability by that age. They
   may stop their term policies and rely on their investments and permanent income to meet the
156                                       AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


  limited needs, which remain. Although SGLI and VGLI are considered to be term-type life
  insurance policies, they are "renewable for life" unlike many commercial term policies.
  Premiums for whole life insurance depend on the age at which the policy is purchased, but
  generally do not increase. However, the premiums are initially greater than term insurance
  premiums at the same age, but then in later years the premiums are less than term policies at
  that age. During the early years of a whole life policy, when higher premiums are being paid,
  the policy may carry a cash value because the premiums paid exceed the actual cost of
  coverage. At some point, the cash value may grow large enough that no more premiums need
  to be charged in order to assure a given "face value" of the policy for life. If the insured takes
  this option, the policy is paid up for their whole life.
  8.3.4. SGLI and VGLI. Another important benefit of SGLI insurance is the ability to convert
  to VGLI after leaving the military. VGLI can be taken in the amount of SGLI the member
  has at the time of separation or a lesser amount. It can be retained for life or converted to
  permanent commercial insurance with the extra costs underwritten by the SGLI program.
  Unless totally disabled, SGLI coverage will terminate at the end of the 120-day period
  following separation, but the SGLI level of coverage may be maintained through VGLI. If
  totally disabled, a member should write to the OSGLI and provide medical evidence of their
  disability to find out if they qualify for an extension of their SGLI coverage for 1 year from
  the date of separation or the date their disability ends, whichever comes first. VGLI can be
  applied for up to 1 year following the 120-day period, but evidence of good health will be
  required. The cost of VGLI increases with each new 5- year age group, becoming
  significantly more expensive after age 65. Thus, VGLI is similar to most other term
  insurance programs.
  8.3.5. Commercial insurance. Almost anyone on active duty or in the Ready Reserve should
  be qualified to buy a commercial life insurance policy at reasonable cost. It all depends on
  the company and type of policy desired. Many military associations provide term insurance
  at a group rate. Because they may screen applicants for health and high-risk practices like
  smoking, flying, parachute jumping, premiums can be fairly competitive, while allowing for
  some profit. Some associations offer the insurance more as a benefit than as a money- making
  proposition and this helps keep premiums down. However, the SGLI premiums are the same
  for everyone, regardless of the risk factors involved and there is no clause for wartime death.
  Some private policies may not pay in the event of a war casualty or if there is no war clause,
  the company may not have the financial resources to pay if war casualties are high
  8.3.6. Family Member Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance. Expands SGLI coverage to
  insurable spouses and children.
      8.3.6.1. If member is covered under SGLI, spouse and children (including step and
      adopted) coverage is automatic. Spouse coverage will add an additional cost to the
      monthly premium. Member may elect to decline or reduce FSGLI for their spouse in
      writing (SGLV 8286A), but children’s coverage is free and cannot be declined unless the
      member is not covered under SGLI.
      8.3.6.2. The amount of spouse coverage cannot exceed the amount of coverage held by
      the member or $100,000 whichever is less. The amount of coverage for children is
      $10,000 each.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                    157


      8.3.6.3. Military members married to other military members covered under SGLI are
      also automatically enrolled in FSGLI coverage.
      8.3.6.4. By law, the military member is the sole beneficiary for FSGLI coverage.
          8.3.6.4.1. Only one parent can receive insurance proceeds for a child.
          8.3.6.4.2. If there is a dispute over which military parent is the beneficiary of the
          child coverage, the spouse who first became eligible for SGLI will be beneficiary.
      8.3.6.5. The cost for spouse coverage is based on the age of the spouse. Refer to current
      cost charts provided by the VA for current cost information at www.insurance.va.gov or
      www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/casualty.
      8.3.6.6. Spouse and children’s coverage continues free for 120 days from the date of
      retirement, separation, or termination of coverage by the military member. Spouse
      coverage can be converted to a permanent civilian policy during the 120-day grace period
      following termination of coverage. Provisions for conversion to a civilian policy are the
      same as for SGLI coverage. Coverage for children cannot be converted to a civilian
      policy.
      8.3.6.7. When a covered family member dies, the CAR is responsible for completing and
      verifying the qualified family member information and completing the SGLV 8283A and
      SGLV 8700. The CAR will forward the completed forms, along with any required
      documentation to AFPC/DPWCS for certification prior to being sent to OSGLI for
      payment.
      8.3.6.8. Reserve and Guard units will report the death of a covered family member by
      sending completed SGLV 8283A and SGLV 8700 to HQ ARPC/DPSPE, 6170 E.
      Irvington Place, Denver CO 80280-4000, for certification prior to being forwarded to
      OSGLI for payment.
8.4. MPS/FSS Customer Se rvice Ele ment Actions.
   8.4.1. When an SGLV 8286 and SGLV 8286A are properly completed, three copies must be
   signed and dated by the member in the appropriate blocks.
      8.4.1.1. The date the forms are completed should be accurately recorded as it determines
      the effective date for the reduction or cancellation of insurance. NOTE: The spouse will
      sent a letter of advisory by the customer service element, when the member reduces,
      declines or elects someone other than the spouse to receive the full SGLI benefit. An
      example          of         the       letter        can        be      located        at:
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForceCasualtyinfo.

8.8. SGLI Beneficiaries.
   8.8.1. An insured member may designate as principal beneficiary or contingent beneficiary
   any person, firm, corporation or legal entity (including the member’s estate), individually or
   as a trustee.
   8.8.2. The following are guidelines to be used in the preparation of the SGLV 8286:
      8.8.2.1. A member should be encouraged to name a specific beneficiary.
          8.8.2.1.1. Use of the ―By Law‖ designation should be discouraged.
      8.8.2.2. If a member does not want to designate a specific beneficiary but prefers the
      proceeds to be paid in the order of precedence, the member should enter ―By Law‖ by his
      or her own hand (printed or cursive) in the appropriate space in part 2 of the form.
          8.8.2.2.1. The insurance proceeds will automatically be paid in the following order of
          precedence:
              8.8.2.2.1.1. Surviving spouse of member.
              8.8.2.2.1.2. Child or children of the member, in equal shares, with the share of
              any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
              8.8.2.2.1.3. Parents in equal shares, or all to the surviving parent. NOTE:
              Biological parents are not always who the member intended to receive the
              proceeds, and in cases of abandonment, they are not always recognized as legal
              parents. Claim disputes involving the recognition of ―rightful‖ parents can be
              avoided by discouraging the use of ―By Law‖ designations and listing the
              parent(s) by name.
              8.8.2.2.1.4. A duly appointed executor or administrator of the member’s estate.
              8.8.2.2.1.5. Other qualified family members.
   8.8.3. When a member is likely to be survived by a spouse, children, or parents and
   designates some other person or entity as beneficiary, an MPS customer service element
   should:
      8.8.3.1. Counsel the member to the fact that the SGLI law was specifica lly designed to
      provide some form of security for spouse, children or parents.
      8.8.3.2. Encourage the member to designate spouse, children, or parents as beneficiaries.
      8.8.3.3. If the unusual designation is to be continued, a memorandum indicating that this
      was discussed with the member should be placed sent to ARMS along with the forms and
      a paper copy should be kept until ARMS is updated as a matter of record.
      8.8.3.4. Under no circumstances should a member be compelled to designate any
      beneficiary other than one of their own choosing.
   8.8.4. When a member wishes to name minors as beneficiaries such as his or her own
   children, nephews, nieces, etc., the member should be advised that the proceeds of the
   insurance cannot be paid to a minor beneficiary, other than a minor surviving spouse, without
   a court-appointed guardian over the children’s financial estates.
 162                                      AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


       8.8.4.1. The appointment of a guardian is often time-consuming and costly and, for that
       reason, may delay the payment of proceeds.
       8.8.4.2. The amount of the proceeds can be materially reduced by the payment of court
       costs, attorney fees and expenses incurred by the guardian. One way to avoid such
       complications and expense is to designate a pre-appointed trustee of the minor
       beneficiary.
8.9. Terminally Ill Death Benefit. Section 302 of the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of
1998, Public Law 105-368, amended chapter 19 of Title 38, U.S.C. to allow terminally ill
members to receive Accelerated Benefits Option (ABO). Anyone who is insured by SGLI, or
VGLI and who is terminally ill is eligible for this benefit. Terminally ill means that a medical
doctor has certified that the insured has 9 months or less to live. Up to 50 percent of the face
value of a servicemembers’ or veterans’ SGLI or VGLI coverage may be paid as an accelerated
benefit, up to $100,000 during their lifetime. The accelerated benefits are paid in a lump sum
only and are exempt from taxation. If an insured wants less than 50 percent of the face value, it
will be paid in $5000 increments only.
   8.9.1. Servicemembers with FSGLI coverage have access to up to 50% of the face value of
   the spousal coverage through the ABO. The ABO is available in $5,000 increments. In order
   to qualify, the spouse must have a medical prognosis of life expe ctancy of 9 months or less.
   This benefit will be paid only to the servicemember.
   8.9.2. Personnel wanting to claim this benefit should provide a letter from their attending
   physician to the OSGLI stating the member or spouse is terminally ill, with prognosis of life
   expectancy of less than 9 months.
   8.9.3. If accelerated benefits are paid, the remaining SGLI/VGLI/FSGLI coverage will be
   reduced correspondingly with the amount of accelerated benefits paid and the insured must
   continue to pay premiums on the remaining coverage.
       8.9.3.1. When accelerated benefits are paid to an active duty member, they must visit the
       MPS customer support section and complete a new form SGLV 8286/SGLV 8286A for
       the remaining coverage.
8.10. Election of Method for Payment of Insurance Proceeds.
   8.10.1. An insured member may elect the proceeds of SGLI be paid to the beneficiary in a
   lump-sum payment or in 36 equal monthly installments.
       8.10.1.1. An insured may also change the method of settlement at any time without the
       consent of the beneficiary.
   8.10.2. If the insured member elects a lump-sum payment or makes no election, the
   beneficiary may choose either the lump-sum settlement or payment in 36 monthly
   installments.
   8.10.3. If the insured member elects 36 monthly installments, the beneficiary may not elect a
   lump-sum payment.

8.11. Payment of SGLI Proceeds.
   8.11.1. The Alliance Account. Effective 1 June 1999 a Prudential Alliance Account became
   the standard method of payment for all OSGLI claims except those listed below, which will
   be made via check:
      8.11.1.1. Installments.
      8.11.1.2. Payments to beneficiaries with non-U.S mailing addresses.
      8.11.1.3. Proceeds payable to multiple parties (i.e., co-executors, co-guardians).
      8.11.1.4. Guardianship claims:
          8.11.1.4.1. That are joint with the court.
          8.11.1.4.2. When the bank is the trustee.
          8.11.1.4.3. That require dual signatures.
          8.11.1.4.4. That require deposit into the court.
   8.11.2. How it works. The Prudential Alliance Account is a personalized interest-bearing
   checking account for beneficiaries of group life insurance proceeds . When a claim is
   approved by OSGLI for payment, life insurance benefits will automatically be placed in the
   Alliance Account in the name of the beneficiary. The beneficiary can withdraw all or part of
   the proceeds immediately or leave the funds in the account to earn interest from the date the
   Alliance Account is opened.
      8.11.2.1. When the account is opened, the beneficiaries are mailed an Alliance Account
      Kit. This information package includes:
          8.11.2.1.1. A cover letter.
          8.11.2.1.2. A claim settlement confirmation outlining the terms and conditions of the
          account, including amount deposited, initial interest rate and yield.
          8.11.2.1.3. A brochure explaining the Alliance Account.
          8.11.2.1.4. An information request to provide Alliance with following: account
          holder contact information, beneficiary for the account, Tax identification
          Number/W-9 Certification.
          8.11.2.1.5. 15 checks (additional checks may be ordered at no cost).
      8.11.2.2. When the kit is mailed, a representative will call the beneficiary to explain that
      it will be arriving in a few days. With permission from the beneficiary, the representative
      will call a second time, after the kit has been received, to verify informatio n and address
      any questions or concerns.
   8.11.3. Advantages for recipients. This account allows recipients more time to make
   financial decisions during a difficult period. Recipients will have immediate access to their
   funds through the checking account A draft can be written for any amount from the account.
   In addition, funds in the account earn interest from the date the account is opened. This
   interest is comparable to rates earned on 6- month certificates of deposit. The interest is
   compounded daily and credited monthly. Interest rates may change monthly but at no time
   will the interest fall below the guaranteed minimum rate of two percent.

   8.11.4. Customer service. Prudential has an Alliance Account Service Center exclusively
   dedicated to answering beneficiary questions about the account. The staff at the Center has
   on- line access information. The representatives are available at 1-877-255-4262, Monday
   through Friday, 0800-2000, Eastern Standard Time.
       8.11.4.1. Prudential’s Alliance Account is a registered trademark of The Prudential
       Insurance Company of America. Open Solutions BIS, Inc. is the Administrator of the
       Prudential Alliance Account Settlement Option, a contractual obligation of The
       Prudential Insurance Company of America, located at 751 Broad Street, Newark, NJ
       07102-3777. Check clearing is provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and processing
       support is provided by Integrated Payment Systems, Inc. Alliance Account balances are
       not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Open Solutions BIS,
       Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Integrated Payment Systems, Inc. are not
       Prudential Financial companies.
8.12. Processing Requests for SGLI Premium Reimbursement.
   8.12.1. When a member claims SGLI premium deductions exceed the level of coverage,
   review the member’s SGLV 8285 and/or SGLV 8286, and DFAS Military Leave and
   Earnings Statement (LES).
   8.12.2. If reimbursement of premiums is warranted, initiate Case Management System
   (CMS) AND SGLV 8286, LES, and system update verification and refer it to
   AFPC/DPWCS.
       8.12.2.1. Include the member’s name, rank, SSN, and an explanation of circumstances.
       8.12.2.2. EXAMPLE: Per SGLV 8286 on file in ARMS, he elected $100,000 coverage
       on 1 May 04. Member’s LES for the months of Jun and Jul 04 reflect a deduction for
       $250,000, and MilPDS reflects the correct level of coverage, which supports a
       reimbursement.
8.13. Application for Correction of Military Record.
   8.13.1. When a member requests reimbursement for overpayment of premium deductio ns for
   any reason other than the MPS erroneously updating the wrong election, and all other
   administrative remedies are exhausted, the member should:
       8.13.1.1. Complete DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record.
       8.13.1.2. Mail the DD Form 149 to the Secretary of the Air Force, Review Board Office
       (SAF/ MRBR), 550 C Street West, Suite 46, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4722.
8.14. Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI).
   8.14.1. Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI)
   provides traumatic injury coverage for members of the uniformed services who are paying
   for SGLI. TSGLI pays a predetermined monetary benefit for losses that are incurred by the
   member as a result of a traumatic injury (e.g. $50,000 for the loss of a leg or an arm).
       8.14.1.1. For the purpose of TSGLI, a traumatic event is defined as the application of
       external force, violence, chemical, biological, or radiological weapons, or accidental
       ingestion of a contaminated substance, or exposure to the elements that causes damage to
       a living being.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                  165


     8.14.1.2. Unlike SGLI which terminates 120 days after the separation, retirement, or
     discharge of the servicemember, TSGLI coverage automatically ends upon the member’s
     date of separation, retirement, or discharge from service.
     8.14.1.3. Spouses and children are not covered by TSGLI even if they are covered by
     FSGLI.
     8.14.1.4. TSGLI was implemented on 1 December 2005 and included a retroactive
     provision for OIF and OEF qualifying injuries back to 7 October 2001.
     8.14.1.5. Prior to 1 December 2005, members must have suffered the qualifying injury
     while deployed outside of CONUS in direct support of OEF or OIF. This part of the
     program is called retroactive TSGLI because it covers injuries which occurred prior to
     the enactment of the benefit.
        8.14.1.5.1. In order to qualify for a retroactive TSGLI payment for a loss that
        occurred between 7 October 2001 and 30 November 2005, an insured service member
        must meet all five of the requirements below.
            8.14.1.5.1.1. The servicemember must have suffered an injury/loss that was the
            direct result of a traumatic event (e.g. a mortar attack or a humvee accident).
            8.14.1.5.1.2. The member must have suffered the traumatic event before
            midnight of the day that the member separated from the uniformed services.
            8.14.1.5.1.3. The member must suffer the qualifying loss within 730 days (two
            years) of the traumatic event.
            8.14.1.5.1.4. The member must survive for a period of at least seven- full-days
            from the date of the traumatic event. The seven-day period begins on the date and
            time of the traumatic event, as measured by Zulu (Greenwich Meridian) time and
            ends 168 full hours later.
            8.14.1.5.1.5. Servicemembers must have suffered the qualifying loss as a direct
            result of injuries incurred in support of Operations OIF/OEF from October 7,
            2001 through and including November 30, 2005.
        8.14.1.5.2. In addition to all five of the above requirements, the servicemember must
        meet one of the two following requirements.
            8.14.1.5.2.1. The member must have been deployed outside the United States on
            orders in support of OEF or OIF at the time the traumatic event occurred.
            8.14.1.5.2.2. The member must have been serving in a geographic location that
            qualified the member for the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion under the Internal
            Revenue Service Code at the time the traumatic event occurred. Note: Coverage
            under SGLI is not a requirement for retroactive TSGLI payment.
166                                        AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


      8.14.1.6. Effective December 1, 2005, TSGLI coverage was implemented for members
      injured as the result of a traumatic event who are insured under SGLI no matter where the
      injury occurred.
  8.14.2. Members of the uniformed services who have full- time or part-time
  Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) are automatically covered by TSGLI while
  the member is in service.

         8.14.2.1.3. Full- time coverage includes members who are drilling for pay and
         members who are drilling for retirement points as long as one of the above
         requirements are met.
      8.14.2.2. Part-Time TSGLI only covers the days the servicemembers are traveling
      directly to and returning directly from their scheduled duty and their days of duty. In
      order to qualify for part-time TSGLI a servicemember must:
         8.14.2.2.1. Be a Ready Reservist who is under a call or order that specifies less than
         31 days of active duty or active duty for training.
         8.14.2.2.2. Be a Ready Reservist who is scheduled to drill less than 12 times during
         the year.
  8.14.3. Injuries excluded from TSGLI are as follows;
      8.14.3.1. A mental disorder.
      8.14.3.2. A mental or physical illness or disease, unless the illness or disease is caused
      by:

—NOTE: These definitions are for the purpose of this AFI only. See Joint Publication 102, DoD

word ―person‖ refers to either civilian or military personnel.
Active Air Force—Members of the Air Force, United States Air Force Academy Cadets, and
Air National Guard and United States Air Force Reserve members serving on extended active
duty (i.e., they are assigned to an active duty unit and their accountability is against active force
strength).
Active Duty (AD)—Full-time duty in the active Military Service of the United States. This
includes members of Reserve components serving on active duty or full- time training duty, but
does not include full- time National Guard duty. AD for Air National Guard is always performed
in a Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.) federal status. Active duty includes active duty for
training and active duty other than for training.
Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty which is used for training members of
Reserve components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed
 180                                       AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


Forces in time of war or national emergency and such other times as the national security
requires. The member is under orders that provide for return to non-active status when the period
of active duty for training is completed. It includes annual training, special tours of active duty
for training, school tours, and the initial duty for training performed by non-prior service
enlistees. ADT for Air National Guard is always performed in a Title 10, U.S.C. federal status
and may be referred to as annual training, special training, formal school training, and initial
active duty for training. Active duty for training can be training under Title 10, U.S.C., Section
12301(b). This duty may satisfy the requirement for an individual to perform 15 days of active
service for training per fiscal year.
Active Duty Other than for Training—A category of active duty used to provide Reserve
component support to either active component or Reserve component missions. It includes the
categories of active duty for special work, active Guard/Reserve duty in Title 10, U.S.C. status,
and involuntary active duty in accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 12301, 12302, and
12304. Training may occur in the conduct of active duty other than for training. Active duty
other than for training in support of the active component is usually supported by Military
Personnel Appropriation man-days.
Active Service—Service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty.
Annuity—The monthly or annual payment a beneficiary receives.
AGATE—A patient is making normal improvement.
Beneficiary—The individual who is entitled to receive certain benefits either by law or written
designation of the servicemember.
BROKE—A patient is evacuated from an overseas medical treatment facility (MTF) to a

Casualty—Any person who is lost to the organization by having been declared dead, duty
status— whereabouts unknown (DUSTWUN), missing, ill, or injured.
Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR)—The person at the Air Force installation
responsible for reporting deaths and assisting survivors.
Casualty Augmentation Support Team (CAST)—A group of individuals trained in casualty
reporting, notification, and assistance procedures that help the CAR and other casualty
personnel. The size of the team is at the FSS/MSS commander's discretion and depends on the
size and mission of the installation it serves.
Casualty Category—Used to specifically classify a casualty for reporting purposes.
AFPC/DPW bases the categories on casualty type and status. Casualty categories include
beleaguered, besieged, captured, detained, died of wounds received in action, interned, killed in
action, missing, missing in action, and wounded in action.
Community Readiness Consultant— A professional employee in the A&FRC that provides
social services related to non- medical counseling, financial assistance/counseling, employment
and transition counseling, readiness and relocation information/planning assistance, and can
provide referrals to agencies in the local community to assist with a multitude of family needs.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                       181


Casualty Status—Used to classify a casualty for reporting purposes. There are six casualty
statuses: deceased, DUSTWUN, missing, very seriously ill or injured (VSI), seriously ill or
injured (SI), or not seriously ill or injured (NSI).
Casualty Type—Used to identify a casualty for reporting purposes as either a hostile casualty or
a non-hostile casualty.
Civilian Employee—A civilian employee hired in the US and assigned overseas. The Air Force
pays civilian employees from Department of the Air Force or DoD appropriated or non-
appropriated funds. A civilian employee must be either a US citizen or a permanent resident
alien not a foreign national.
Continental United States (CONUS)—United States territory, including the adjacent territorial
waters, located within North America between Canada and Mexico. When used for ANG
casualties, the term applies to the geographical limits of the 50 states and the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.
CRIMP—A patient is not recovering satisfactorily.
Date of Death—Either the date a person died as determined by actual knowledge of the death, a
date the Air Force determines based on conclusive evidence, or the date the Air Force declares a
person dead based on a presumptive finding of death. Laws on brain death differ among states
and countries. The Air Force determines the date of death based on local law and on when
doctors declare a person brain dead or remove life support systems. When the Air Force
determines that a DUSTWUN member has died, the official date of death is the date the Air
Force declared the member DUSTWUN, unless conclusive evidence establishes a later date. The
date of death for missing persons depends on either conclusive evidence of death or a
presumptive finding of death. The Service secretary, an appointed designee, or a medical
authority determines the date of death based on conclusive evidence. The date of death based on
a presumptive finding of death is the date the Service secretary or an appointed designee signs
the change in casualty status from missing to deceased.
Death Certificate (Military)—The official DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, published by
Headquarters, United States Air Force. The DD Form 1300 is used to provide an official record
of the death of a military member. The form may be used in place of a civilian death certificate
when proof of death is necessary. Government agencies and most commercial life insurance
companies use the DD Form 1300 as the basis for paying benefits. It may be used to facilitate the
cashing of bonds or in the settlement of any other claim in which proof of death is required.
Deceased—A casualty status applicable to a person who is either known to have died,
determined to have died on the basis of conclusive evidence, or declared to be dead on the basis
of a presumptive finding of death. The recovery of remains is not a prerequisite to determining or
declaring a person deceased.
Defense Casualty Information Processing System (DCIPS)— DCIPS is an electronic system
used in the collection and management of Casualty data and to produce the ―Report of Casualty‖
DD Form 1300 and other documents and reports.
Defense Casualty Information Processing System- Casualty Reporting (DCIPS-CR)—The
web-based application that provides CARs the ability to record, store, and submit casualty
information.

MEMORANDUM FOR AFPC/DPWCM
FROM: (Organization Mailing Address)
SUBJECT: 9-Month Investigation Report on a Missing Person
This 9- month investigation report pertains to Major Roger C. Smith, 023-45-6789, missing from
Eglin AFB FL since 15 May 1997. I am forwarding it IAW AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services,
Chapter 2.
The initial circumstances surrounding the loss of Major Smith in an Eglin AFB Aero club Cessna
172 aircraft incident remain unchanged. We have maintained close contact with Air Force, state,
and federal investigative agencies in an attempt to establish Major Smith's true status. However,
all follow-up actions have been negative. The only supplemental information you haven't
received in subsequent reports is that on 14 December 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration
office in Pensacola FL thought a dredging machine had recovered the tail section of the missing
aircraft in a body of water adjacent to Eglin AFB. Further analysis revealed it was from a Piper
Cub rather than a Cessna.
I based my decision to place Major Smith in a missing status on my belief that he probably
encountered severe weather soon after his departure on a routine night training flight, and that
the aircraft crashed within 20 miles of Eglin AFB. Given his outstanding physical condition, I
felt it was possible for him to survive on one of the small islands in the area, even if injured, until
he could be located by search and rescue personnel or recreational boaters or fishermen.
Considering the passage of time without any information from or about Major Smith or a nything
whatsoever concerning the missing aircraft, it now appears that Major Smith did not survive the
crash of his aircraft, which apparently occurred over water. Accordingly, I recommend that the
Air Force change the status of Major Roger C. Smith from missing to deceased.

                  CASUALTY NOTIFICATION OFFICER CHECKLIST

A6.1. Purpose of Notification. To provide dignified, compassionate and humane notification
to NOK and other designated persons as promptly as possible after a member is placed in a
casualty status of deceased, Duty Status-Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN), or Missing.
A6.2. Background.
   A6.2.1. This checklist provides guidance for preparing and completing casualty
   notifications.
   A6.2.2. A casualty notification will probably be one of the hardest duties you will perform in
   your military career.
   A6.2.3. You must convey, in every action and deed, the sincere concern of the Air Force for
   the feelings of the NOK.
   A6.2.4. Your duty as a casualty notification officer is to ―soften the blow,‖ if possible, and to
   show that the Air Force is genuinely concerned about its members and their families.
   A6.2.5. Each notification is unique as a result of the individuals and circumstances
   surrounding the incident. We cannot cover all situations that you might encounter. We hope
   this checklist will provide enough information to assist you in preparing and completing a
   casualty notification and ease some of the anxiety often experienced by individuals when
   called upon to perform this sensitive task.
   A6.2.6. Remember, nothing can substitute for common sense, good judgment, and
   sensitivity in making a casualty notification.
A6.3. Casualty Notification Responsibility.
   A6.3.1. Air Force Personnel Center, Casualty Services Branch (AFPC/DPWCS) assigns the
   Air Force activity (active Air Force, Air National Guard, United States Air Force Reserve,
   and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps) nearest to the next of kin’s (NOK) residence
   to accomplish the casualty notification.
   A6.3.2. If the NOK live on or near the member’s home installation, the member’s wing,
   group, squadron commander, or other officer, as determined by the installation commander,
   effects personal notification to the NOK, provides circumstances surrounding the incident
   and expresses condolences.
       A6.3.2.1. The casualty notification duty:
       A6.3.2.2. Is on behalf of the Air Force Chief of Staff.
       A6.3.2.3. Has priority over all duties, except in emergencies.
       A6.3.2.4. Is accomplished in service dress uniform with the exception of the medical
       technician who can wear whites (he/she remains in the vehicle).
A6.4. Notification Team Composition.
   A6.4.1. Field grade officers, of equal or higher grade than the member about whom they are
   making notification, are assigned the responsibility for personal notification as directed by
 194                                     AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011


   the installation commander or AFPC, Chief, Casualty Services Branch (AFPC/DPWCS).
   EXCEPTION: AFPC/ DPWCS may assign other officers to notification duty.
       A6.4.1.1. Team composition will consist of a minimum of two military members.
          A6.4.1.1.1. Medical personnel (e.g., doctor, nurse, or medical technician) and an Air
          Force chaplain, if available, accompany the notification o fficer to attend to any
          reaction of the NOK.
          A6.4.1.1.2. Notification should not be delayed due to the inability to obtain a medical
          officer or chaplain. However, there must be two military members on the team and
          leadership should choose another team member.
   A6.4.2. The commander or notification officer may invite another person to accompany the
   notification team such as a friend, co-worker or clergy/leader from the member’s faith
   community, known by the member’s NOK whose presence may be comforting to t he NOK,
   if it does not delay the notification process.
   A6.4.3. On active duty installations, notification team members normally assemble in the
   casualty assistance representative’s (CAR) office within one hour after receiving the
   telephone call from the CAR.
       A6.4.3.1. In most instances, an error- free notification letter has already been prepared
       and is ready for the notification officer to deliver to the NOK.
       A6.4.3.2. A notification letter is not required when the member’s commander personally

          A6.8.2.2.3. The ―Notification Script Regarding Media Coverage at Dover AFB‖,
          ―Consent/ Non-consent Media Coverage Release,‖ and FAQs are used to help the
          PNOK make a decision in granting or denying the news media coverage. This
          includes, observing and photographing the PNOK’s loved one’s remains during the
          dignified transfer of his/her flag-draped transfer case and military or contract
          transport to ground transportation at the Port Mortuary, Dover AFB . This document
          is also used to record the PNOK’s desire to travel to Dover AFB, to observe the DT at
          government expense.
       A6.8.2.3. You will need to confirm the NOK’s name, relationship, and address, and note
       any special conditions (e.g., age, ill health, or precarious location of NOK) prior to
       leaving the base.
       A6.8.2.4. Instructions if problems occur.
       A6.8.2.5. Map of the area, if available.

   A6.8.3. Familiarize yourself with the location of the NOK, the circumstances of the incident,
   and the notification letter.
       A6.8.3.1. If you are unsure of the NOK's location, ask the CAR, AFPC/DPWCS, or local
       authorities for help.
       A6.8.3.2. If the NOK reside within an area where your safety may be threatened, req uest
       a police escort.
A6.9. Inability to Locate the NOK.
   A6.9.1. If it appears the NOK is not at home, you should contact neighbors, law enforcement
   agencies, or the local postmaster (not a postal clerk) for information regarding the NOK’s
   whereabouts.
   A6.9.2. If you or the team cannot locate the NOK, or the NOK has moved from the area, you
   should immediately telephone AFPC/DPWCS toll- free at 1-800-433-0048 for further
   guidance and provide the information concerning attempts to contact the NOK.
A6.10. Making the Notification.
   A6.10.1. If you are notifying the PNOK of a death that occurred in the theater of combat
   operations, and the remains are being processed through the Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, you
   will call AFPC/DPWCS toll- free at 1-800-433-0048 for updated arrival information of the
   remains to Dover AFB. This call will be done prior to arrival at the PNOK’s residence and is
   not to be conducted in front of or inside the PNOK’s residence. Again, AFPC/DPWCS will
   brief you on the proper procedures prior to your leaving the base. Ensure you are familiar
   with your portion of the briefing.
   A6.10.2. A representative of the Air Force notifies the NOK in person whenever possible.
AFI36-3002_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2011                                                     197


  A6.10.3. The Air Force honors the NOK’s wishes to notify other NOK. EXAMPLE: If the
  spouse wishes to notify adult children or the parents.
  A6.10.4. If the NOK calls to ask about a member’s status before they receive official
  notification, AFPC/DPWCS, the member’s commander or a designated representative, or the
  CAR, tells the caller the member’s status during the call. You will be notified by
  AFPC/DPWCS if the NOK is already aware of the death.
  A6.10.5. You must be alert to the needs of the NOK and represent the Air Force in a
  professional manner.
     A6.10.5.1. Being prepared, sincere, and alert to the needs of the NOK at time of
     notification will reduce some of the shock that is normal under these circumstances.
  A6.10.6. Stereotyped procedures are not appropriate.
  A6.10.7. As a minimum, you should:

     Support Squadron at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas."
     A6.10.7.2. After identifying yourself, make sure you are speaking to the correct
     person(s) by confirming the identity of the NOK. EXAMPLE: "Are you Mr. Thomas
     Brown, the father of Staff Sergeant Carl Thomas Brown?"
     A6.10.7.3. If at least one person to be notified is home, you should state that you have an
     important message to deliver and ask permission to enter the residence.
     A6.10.7.4. Verbally relate to the NOK, without reading from the notification letter, the
     information contained in the letter, if applicable. EXAMPLE: ―On behalf of the Chief of
     Staff, United States Air Force, I regret to inform you that your son, Staff Sergeant Carl
     Thomas Brown, died in Texas today as a result of injuries received in a motorcycle
     accident.‖ Then paraphrase any additional circumstances described in the notification
     letter.
     A6.10.7.5. Do not hurry the words; speak as naturally as possible.
     A6.10.7.6. Do not extend overly sympathetic gestures that may be taken the wrong way.
     A6.10.7.7. Do not physically touch the NOK in any manner other than to assist in an
     emergency. If necessary, summon the medical representative on the team or local
     emergency personnel.
     A6.10.7.8. Avoid making detailed statements about the incident.
     A6.10.7.9. Inform the NOK that the deceased member’s commander will send a letter
     explaining and confirming the circumstances surrounding the incident.
         A6.10.7.9.1. If you are the member’s commander or a designated representative and
         have first-hand knowledge of the circumstances, you may give the NOK additional
         information.

       A6.10.7.10. Inform the NOK eligible for casualty assistance that a casualty assistance
       representative will contact them within 24 hours to arrange for a casualty assistance visit
       at their convenience.
       A6.10.7.11. Inform the NOK that:
          A6.10.7.11.1. For CONUS casualties, a mortuary affairs representative will contact
          them regarding mortuary affairs.
          A6.10.7.11.2. For overseas casualties, HQ Air Force Mortuary Services, Dover AFB,
          Delaware, will contact them regarding mortuary affairs. (NOTE: OIF/OEF death
          cases See A6.10.6.)
       A6.10.7.12. Give the notification letter to the NOK, if applicable.
       A6.10.7.13. If the NOK have questions or need additional information, have them call
       HQ AFPC/DPWCS toll- free at 1-800-433-0048, and AFPC/DPWCS will put the NOK in
       touch with their (husband’s, wife’s, son’s, daughter’s, father’s, or mother’s) commander.

   A6.11.1. Questions about survivor benefits, burial, or similar matters.

   address these issues. NOTE: For deaths occurring in the theater of combat operations and
   being processed through the Port Mortuary at Dover AFB , a script and attached Questions
   and Answers will be provided to aid you in answering questions limited to the media
   coverage of their loved one’s dignified transfer and how to request government provided
   travel to observe the dignified transfer in person. However, you should allow AFMAO to
   answer these questions for the PNOK.
   A6.11.4. Questions relating to line of duty, negligence, errors in judgment or the
   responsibility of other personnel concerned with the incident.
   A6.11.5. Your prior experiences or personal conjectures.
   A6.11.6. In short, limit your discussion to the information contained in the notification letter
   and do not discuss matters that you are not qualified to discuss.
A6.12. After the Notification.
   A6.12.1. Confirm the NOK’s address is correct and obtain their telephone number for future
   contact.
   A6.12.2. Ask the PNOK if they wish to personally notify other immediate NOK or have

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith
I was very sorry to learn of the death of your son, Lieutenant Colonel Joe P. Smith.
My office assists the next of kin of Air Force members apply for government benefits they may
be entitled to as the result of a member's death. We have been helping your daughter- in- law,
Mrs. Jane M. Smith, apply for her benefits and privileges.
In certain circumstances, parents are also eligible for benefits from the Social Security
Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Based on your son’s earnings, for
you to be eligible for Social Security benefits you must be at least 62 years of age and you must
have been dependent on him for over one-half of your support at the time of his death. If you
believe you may be eligible, you should contact the nearest Social Security office.
Regardless of dependency, if your combined annual income is less than ______ (excluding any
income you are receiving from the VA), you may be eligible for VA Depende ncy and Indemnity
Compensation. This depends on the VA determining that Colonel Smith's d eath was service
related. The VA is currently deciding this issue on behalf of his widow. If you believe you may
be eligible, you should contact the nearest VA office.

Please accept my deepest condolences at the tragic death of your daughter, Sergeant Lori A.
Jones on 11 May 2009. Her loss saddened the members of this organization.
At the time of the accident, Lori was performing her duties as flight engineer on a C-130 aircraft.
The aircraft was scheduled to fly a navigational training mission, taking o ff from Hill Air Force
Base, Utah, with a scheduled landing at the same base 4 hours later. Shortly after takeoff, the
aircraft departed its controlled flight pattern and crashed in the Wasatch mountains, east of the
base.
Your daughter was a fine Air Force crewmember who was well liked by everyone here in the
wing. Her love of flying led to the establishment of many friendships and associations. We all
feel a personal loss in her untimely death.

San Antonio, Texas 78232


Dear Mrs. Hanes


It is with deep regret that I write to inform you that the status of your husband has been changed
from whereabouts unknown to missing. As I have explained, whereabouts unknown is a
transitory duty status which provides a commander with additional time to decide on the most
accurate status for a member. Since no additional information surfaced during our extensive
search for John's aircraft, and I remain unsure of his true status, I have declared him missing.


The Air Force continued the search efforts I previously described to you until yesterday, when
we concluded that no evidence remained that search aircraft or naval vessels could detect within
the range of John’s aircraft. We searched an area of approximately 80,000 square miles, with
concentrated efforts in the area that would most likely have contained wreckage. Both the US Air
Force and the US Navy dedicated many aircraft to the search. Some commercial airlines and
numerous Civil Air Patrol aircraft also participated in the search. Electronic surveillance of the
search area will continue for the next 2 weeks. Please be assured that if I receive any new
information concerning your husband's status, I will notify you immediately.


I am compiling a detailed report containing all known information concerning the incident. This
report should be complete within 5 days, at which time I will forward it to the Air Force Missing
Persons Branch. That office will provide you with additional information and will keep you
informed of all future developments concerning John's status.


If you wish to correspond with the Missing Persons Branch, you may write to AFPC/DPWCM,
550 C Street West, Suite 15, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4717, or call 1-800-531-5501.
On behalf of John's many friends in the 345th Tactical Fighter Wing, please accept my deepest
condolences during this time of anxiety. If I can be of personal assistance, please contact me at
any time at (210) 652-XXXX.

Please accept my deepest condolences at the tragic death of your son, First Lieutenant Henry A.
Jones, Jr., on 9 May 2009. His loss saddened the members of this organization. I want to explain
the circumstances that led to Henry’s death as we understand them.


Henry had walked to the bus stop with Stacey and Nicole to see them off to school. After they
were on their way, Henry began jogging and had run for about two blocks when he collapsed. He
went into convulsions and was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation by a passing motorist while
an ambulance was being summoned. Henry was transported to the Good Samaritan Hospital in
Tampa, Florida, where he was pronounced dead on arrival from an apparent heart attack.


You should be very proud of your son. He was a fine young man who was certainly well liked by
everyone. Henry's achievements were many. His dedication to duty led to the establishment of
many friendships and associations. We all feel a great personal loss in his untimely death.

Henry and his date were returning to Colorado Springs early Tuesday morning in Henry's car.
On the expressway, just outside the city limits, his car left the southbound lane, went over the
curb, and struck a bridge abutment. All available evidence indicates that both Henry and
passenger died instantly.

111 Pine Street

Dear Mrs. Smith


Please accept my heartfelt condolences on the death of your husband, Major John A. Smith. John
was highly respected by the members of the 111th Fighter Wing, both for his exceptional
leadership abilities and his skill as a pilot. I want to explain the circumstances surrounding
John’s death as we understand them at this time.


John departed Riyadh Air Base at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of March 30 to conduct a visual
reconnaissance mission in a heavily defended, hostile area. After completing a series of
reconnaissance runs and accomplishing an in- flight refueling, he returned to the target area to
continue his mission. During the flight, the aircraft encountered enemy gunfire, and the navigator
reported that he heard two loud explosions. Despite the navigator’s continued attempts to contact
him, no contact was made. The navigator flew the aircraft to a safe area and elected to eject both
himself and John rather than to attempt a landing. The ejection was successful; however, John
had already suffered fatal injuries. It was determined that he died instantly as a result of enemy
ground fire.


His gallantry on this mission was typical of the outstanding devotion he has demonstrated
throughout the past 8 months. I am proud to have been associated with John, and I join with the
rest of the wing in expressing our deepest condolences at his loss. Be assured that I stand ready
to help you in any way I can during this time of sorrow.

John was one of the finest airmen in the 100th Mission Support Squadron. I am personally aware
of the numerous accomplishments John made while assigned here. Additionally, John was very
active in the community, particularly with the church and physical fitness activities. He always
promoted teamwork and positive motivation. I never saw John without a smile!


John was definitely a topnotch performer. He was selected Airman of the Quarter for the period
1 October through 31 December 2008, at both the squadron and group level. This was a
remarkable achievement!


Please know we share in your pain and sorrow and offer final respects to one of our very best—
John will certainly be missed by all of us.
