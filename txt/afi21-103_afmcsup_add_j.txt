This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
Utilization Reporting. It establishes policy and assigns responsibility to provide AFMC Test
Fleet aircraft status changes/updates in accordance with (IAW) current maintenance conditions
and the developed MDS specific mission essential subsystem list (MESL). This instruction
applies to all AFMC organizations that manage or perform maintenance on AFMC
owned/possessed aircraft regardless of Air Force Specialty Code. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Send comments and
suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, to HQ AFMC/A4MM, 462 Chidlaw Road, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006.

These MESLs complement AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
They apply to maintenance activities supporting AFMC test missions across AFMC.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of assigned/possessed AFMC test fleet aircraft and equipment
 2                              AFI21-103_AFMCSUP_ADDENDUM_J 19 OCTOBER 2011


supporting AFMC test missions. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that
must work on test fleet aircraft to perform specifically assigned unit test, training or other
missions.
1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define system exceptions and help explain complex degraded
mission systems.
1.2. It is understood that any aircraft or support equipment system or subsystem may be
subjected to test or tested under a test scenario and/or are test dependent as directed by the test
mission director. If identified by test mission director, those systems or subsystems if not
already identified by qualifying notes must be operational to be considered FMC or PMC for that
mission.
2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC or UNS
column (column 2) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
(BSLs) across the page (DTE - Developmental Test and Evaluation, DTS - Developmental Test
Support, TNG - Training). Each unitâ€™s Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement
determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft or equipment MESLs incorporate all
AFMC assigned/possessed aircraft/equipment and therefore it is important to compare only the
columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the units assigned/possessed aircraft. For
example, units with training (TF) coded aircraft would determine report status using only the
FSL and TNG columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using
the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft/equipment assignment code or type
mission being flown.
