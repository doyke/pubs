1. DoD PPBE Process.
     1.1. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Process. The PPBE
     system is the DoD resource management process with four interrelated phases consistent
     with national security objectives, policies, and strategies. Its purpose is to identify capability
     requirements (Planning), and match them with resource requirements (Programming),
     translate them into budget proposals (Budgeting), and evaluate spending (Execution) to
     determine how well the desired capabilities will be achieved. The Secretary of Defense
     (SECDEF) provides centralized policy direction throughout the four phases, while delegating
     program development, execution authority, and responsibility to Services and DoD agencies.
        1.1.1. MID 913 directed a significant change to the existing PPBS process. Beginning
        with the FY04 Program Objective Memorandum, Office of the Secretary of Defense
        (OSD) Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) implemented a 4-year process
        comprised of two 2-year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution cycles. The
        table below describes the details of each of the four years dealt with in 2-year cycles.
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                                                 5

   1.2. Planning. The first phase of the PPBE process, planning, begins as a DoD function. It
   is a vision of the future with broad strategies and plans. The planning phase encompasses
   long-range guidance out to 20-years, long-range objectives out to 10-years, and mid-term
   planning out to 6-years. Long-range guidance and objectives are generated to define the
   major force modernization and investment requirements for each DoD component. The
   Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) and the Joint Programming Guidance (JPG) have
   replaced the Defense Planning Guidance and guide the mid-term planning period. Both
   documents are published every other year, but the SPG may be published annually at the
   discretion of the SECDEF.
       1.2.1. The SPG is designed to provide focused, timely, strategic direction to resource
       allocation decisions of the DoD. The priorities in the SPG help provide the common
       analytical and programmatic course to build the joint capabilities needed to overcome the
       diverse challenges of the future.
       1.2.2. The JPG conveys the SECDEF’s decisions on issues developed through the
       Enhanced Planning Process (EPP) and on other matters of high priority. The guidance is
       fiscally constrained, executable, and mandatory. Implementation must be consistent with
       strategic direction and priorities set forth in the SPG.
   1.3. Programming. The second phase of the PPBE process, programming, applies
   constraints to the OSD vision developed in the planning phase. Programming is primarily a
   military department/agency function. Programming translates DoD guidance into action,
   balances allocation of resources to plans (requirements), organizes requirements into
   packages (programs), and prioritizes programs based on capabilities/risks.
       1.3.1. The Services’ Program Objective Memorandum (POM) is developed within the
       fiscal constraints set forth by the administration. These fiscal constraints guide the
       Services to make choices to meet the requirements of the SPG and JPG. The POM
       covers the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). In even-numbered years, the FYDP
       covers six years, as opposed to five years in odd-numbered years. Services then submit
       their POM to the OSD for review and compliance with directives and guidance.

        1.3.2. OSD Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) is responsible for the Program
        Review cycle and ensures the programs and corresponding resources are consistent with
        the objectives of the SECDEF and the President. PA&E issues Program Decision
        Memorandums (PDMs) to the Services highlighting OSD changes to any of the
        programs.
     1.4. Budgeting. The third phase of the PPBE process, budgeting, involves the formulation
     and control of near-term resource requirements, allocation, and use, based on the results of
     the planning and programming efforts. The budget is developed from the POM, as modified
     by the PDMs. The budget phase takes the first two resource years of the POM and prepares
     the requirements for presentation to OSD and Congress.
        1.4.1. Budget Review is OSD’s opportunity to ensure programs are correctly costed and
        dollars are budgeted against them within fiscal management rules and policies.
        1.4.2. OSD Comptroller (OSD (C)) is responsible for the Budget Review cycle and
        issues Program Budget Decisions (PBDs) highlighting proposed changes to the Services’
        budgets.
        1.4.3. In this process there is some opportunity for the programs to be adjusted to better
        meet capability requirements before submittal to Congress. Services may provide
        reclamas to draft PBDs, and signed PBDs that contain unacceptable issues and may be
        appealed with OSD via negotiation or may be designated major budget issues.
     1.5. Management Initiative Decision (MID) 913. MID 913 makes the Program Review
     and Budget Review concurrent under what is now called the Program Budget Review (PBR).
     Under MID 913, the PDM and PBD cycles both enact changes to Service’s POMs. The
     Budget Estimate Submission (BES) phase is no longer independent.
     1.6. Execution. The final phase of the PPBE process is the execution of the program-
     budget. Execution is the process by which the performance of the planning, programming,
     and budgeting phases are translated into warfighter capability. IAW MID 910, the
     effectiveness of the PPBE must be measured and validated with metrics.
2. Air Force PPBE Process.
     2.1. Goal. The goal of the Air Force PPBE process is to provide the best implementation
     and execution of the defense objectives in support of our national goals established by the

3. Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS).
     3.1. Overview. The Air Force implements the PPBE process through the AFCS. The
     strength of the AFCS (see figure 1) is the consistency of reviews tied to successive
     evaluation by grade level and experience within the functional staff (i.e. SAF/FM, AF/A3,
     AF/A4, etc.). It is not intended to supplant the functional staff but to enhance it and provide
     balance when making resource allocation decisions. The functional staff continues to
     conduct its functional business and reviews. The AFCS increases overall management
     effectiveness by applying cross-functional judgment, experience, and analysis to program
     adjustments in a resource limited environment.
     3.1. (AFISRA) Overview. The AFISRA Corporate Structure exists to serve as a rapid and
     representative decision-making and information dissemination body capable of addressing
     any issue requiring a consolidated AFISRA position or an AFISRA Commander decision.
     The corporate structure is deliberately designed as an inclusive process for consolidating,
     prioritizing, and approving (including, but not limited to Planning, Programming, Budgeting,
     and Execution System (PPBES) products, Strategic Planning, Facilities, Military
     Construction, Research & Development, Manpower Review, Programmatic Reviews, Initial
     Distribution, Financial Plans, Budget Execution Reviews). At the discretion of the
     Commander, AFISRA or Vice Commander, the corporate structure may also provide general
     corporate guidance; serve as information venue, or as a coordination tool. The corporate
     structure must be responsive to National and Service priorities, vision, core competencies and
     critical factors affecting the conduct of AFISRA across the full spectrum of operations. It
     must also be consistent with every aspect of national agency and Service-level PPBE cycles.
     The Agency Director of Staff (AFISRA/DS) has overall responsibility for the AFISRA
     Corporate Structure and will be the approval authority for any deviation from the Group
     review, Board recommendation, and Council approval process.
        3.1.1. The AFCS enables Air Force transformation by supporting a capabilities-based
        resource allocation program. The AFCS presents the best courses of action to the
        Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) for
        making resource-based decisions. The top-down deliberative elements of the AFCS are
        the Air Force Council (AFC), the Air Force Board (AFB), the Air Force Group (AFG),
        and the 13 Mission and Mission Support Panels. The AFCS is guided by the Air Force
        Concepts of Operations (AF CONOPS) (Global Mobility, Global Persistent Attack,
        Global Strike, Homeland Security, Nuclear Response, Space and Command, Control,
        Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR),
        and Agile Combat Support) and the Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA)
        process informs investment decisions and the development of the Air Force POM.
        3.1.2. The ultimate goals of the AFCS are to: provide a multifunctional, cross-staff
        perspective on all key Air Force programs; enhance responsiveness to program issues;
        support corporate decision-making through interaction with Mission/Mission Support
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                             9


     Panels; and cut across organizational barriers to improve the corporate decision-making
     process.
     3.1.3. Process Timing is on a calendar year schedule. Refer to Air Force POM
     Preparation Instruction (PPI) and DoD Instruction 7045.7 for calendar of events.
     3.1.4. (Added-AFISRA) The AFISRA Corporate Structure has four levels: Council,
     Board, Group and Panels (see Figure 1). AFISRA/A5/8/9 will manage the Corporate
     Structure for the AFISRA/DS. The Commander, AFISRA is the final approving authority
     for all actions. Decisions requiring an official AFISRA position often have short
     suspenses but significant impact. In this regard, the AFISRA Corporate Structure may be
     required to convene and deliberate on very short notice. AFISRA Corporate Structure
     duties take precedence over routine staff functions. In those rare instances, where short
     suspenses preclude the convening of all levels of the corporate process construct, the
     sponsoring directorate will seek and obtain AFISRA/DS approval for any deviation.
     (Council/Board/Group/Panels).
        3.1.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) The ISR Corporate Structure participants are the
        AFISRA Directorates and Special Staff who will provide appropriate level Council,
        Board, Group and Panel representatives. Other supporting participating entities will
        provide membership at the appropriate level when required. Those with specific
        AFISRA Corporate Structure responsibilities are:
            3.1.4.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Director     of     Manpower          and     Personnel
            (AFISRA/A1) is responsible for manpower issues.
            3.1.4.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Director        of   Analysis      and     Applications
            (AFISRA/A2) is responsible for intelligence exploitation, analysis and production
            matters.
            3.1.4.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and
            Reconnaissance Operations (AFISRA/A3) is responsible for identification,
            validation, and prioritization of operations requirements upon entry to the
            AFISRA corporate process.
            3.1.4.1.4. (Added-AFISRA) Director of Logistics, Installations, and Mission
            Support (AFISRA/A4/7) is responsible for identifying, validating, and prioritizing
            logistics, mission system maintenance and civil engineering requirements.
            AFISRA/A4/7 also provides advice on contracting and support agreement policy
            and authorities.
            3.1.4.1.5. (Added-AFISRA) Director of Plans, Programs, Requirements, and
            Assessments (AFISRA/A5/8/9) is responsible for planning and programming
            matters. AFISRA/A5/8/9 will establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for
            meeting schedules and briefing/minutes formats for the AFISRA Corporate
            Structure. AFISRA/A5/8/9 will also establish and maintain the AFISRA
            Corporate Structure Sharepoint site.
            3.1.4.1.6. (Added-AFISRA) Director of Communications (AFISRA/A6), as the
            AFISRA Chief Information Officer (CIO), is responsible for management,
            oversight of communications and information policy, guidance and

            modernization, validation, Information Technology (IT) requirements; and
            providing IT investment recommendations to the corporate process.
            3.1.4.1.7. (Added-AFISRA) Director of Financial Management (AFISRA/FM),
            as the AFISRA Comptroller, is responsible for budgeting and funds execution.
            3.1.4.1.8. (Added-AFISRA) Staff Judge Advocate (AFISRA/JA) provides legal
            advice and expert opinion.
     3.1.5. (Added-480ISRW) The 480 ISR WG Corporate Structure has three levels:
     Council, Board, and Panel (See Figure 1.). 480 ISR WG/XP will manage the Corporate
     Structure for the 480 ISR WG/CC. The Commander, 480 ISR WG is the final approving
     authority for all PPBE actions forwarded to AFISRA. Decisions requiring an official
     Wing position often have short suspenses from higher headquarters. As a result, the
     Wing’s Corporate Structure may be required to convene and deliberate on very short
     notice. Wing Corporate Structure duties take precedence over routine staff functions. In
     those rare instances where short suspenses preclude the convening of all levels of the
     corporate process construct, the sponsoring directorate will seek and obtain 480 ISR
     WG/CV approval for any deviation from this three-level corporate process construct.
        3.1.5.1. (Added-480ISRW) 480 ISR WG Staff will provide appropriate level
        Council, Board, and Panel representatives as listed below:
            3.1.5.1.1. (Added-480ISRW) The Director of Operations (480 ISR WG/DO) is
            responsible for identification, validation, and the initial prioritization of
            operations and communications systems requirements upon entry to the 480 ISR
            WG corporate process. The final prioritization recommendation will be made
            corporately.
            3.1.5.1.2. (Added-480ISRW) The Chief of Financial Management (480 ISR
            WG/FM), as the 480 ISR WG Comptroller, is responsible for budgeting and
            budget execution.
            3.1.5.1.3. (Added-480ISRW) The Chief of Warfighting Integration (480 ISR
            WG/XC) is responsible for systems integration and communications issues.
            3.1.5.1.4. (Added-480ISRW) The Chief of Mission Support (480 ISR WG/MS)
            is responsible for manpower and personnel matters.
            3.1.5.1.5. (Added-480ISRW) The Chief of Plans, Programs and Exercises
            Division (480 ISR WG/XP) is responsible for planning and programming
            matters.       In addition, the Chief, Plans and Programs Branch (480 ISR
            WG/XPP) serves as the corporate process secretariat (CPS) responsible for the
            administration of corporate activities.    The 480 ISR WG/XPP will establish
            standard operating procedures (SOPs) for meeting schedules, briefing/minutes
            formats, and will be responsible for documenting decisions and tracking
            associated corporate process action items.
            3.1.5.1.6. (Added-480ISRW) The Chief of Civil Engineering (480 ISR WG/CE)
            is responsible for the Wing’s facilities planning and requirements.
            3.1.5.1.7. (Added-480ISRW) The Chief of Logistics (480 ISR WG/LG) is
            responsible for maintenance communication functions and supply management
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                                 11


              providing mission and system sustainment.
              3.1.5.1.8. (Added-480ISRW) The 497 ISR GP, 548 ISR GP, 692 ISR GP, 693
              ISR GP, 694 ISR GP, 27 IS commanders, or their appointed representatives, will
              represent the operational capabilities embodied in their unit at various corporate
              levels as appropriate.
   3.2. Air Force Council (AFC). The AFC is the senior forum for cross-functional
   consideration of the most critical Air Force issues. The AFC reviews and evaluates Air
   Force objectives, policies, plans, programs, budgets, and studies to make timely
   recommendations to the SECAF and CSAF. The AFC also provides expeditious Deputy
   Chiefs of Staff (DCS)-level coordination on significant, urgent, and complex issues to ensure
   that Air Force plans, polices, and programs comply with Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), OSD,
   and national objectives. The AFC returns issues to the Air Force Board (AFB) for further
   study. The AFC is chaired by the AF/CV, and membership consists of Air Staff and
   Secretariat Principals (3-star and civilian equivalent with some selected 2-star members).
   3.2. (AFISRA) Council. The AFISRA Council is the Senior-level, corporate advisory body
   to the Commander, AFISRA. No decision-level programming or budgetary actions should
   reach the Commander, AFISRA without thorough vetting through the corporate structure.
   Normal corporate decision processes, however, will consist of either the AFISRA/CV or
   AFISRA/CA presenting the Board recommendation for the Commander’s approval. When
   convened, the Council will have a designated sponsor (usually the Chair for the Group), the
   sponsor will, through the AFISRA/A5/8/9 Executive, schedule the Council meetings (which
   may be enabled for video teleconferencing). The sponsor will provide read-aheads in an
   established format no later than three working days prior to the Council meeting. During the
   meeting, the sponsor will provide a recorder to take meeting minutes (in established format)
   that will include Council decisions and actions. The sponsor will forward the minutes to the
   AFISRA/DS no later than three working days after the Council has met. Upon approval by
   the AFISRA/DS, the sponsor will post the approved minutes on the AFISRA Corporate
   Structure Sharepoint site. The Commander, AFISRA is the final approving authority for
   issues presented to the Council. The Commander, AFISRA may direct AFISRA/CV or
   AFISRA/CA to chair meetings and approve recommendations in his/her absence.
Council Advisors are as follows:

AFISRA: CV | CA | DS | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4/7 | A5/8/9 | A6 | FM | HC | HO | IG | JA | PA | SE |
SG | SO | CR

AF MAJCOMS as appropriate (Advisors for R&D investment issues: All MAJCOM/A2s)

Council Advisors may also consist of Board members, Group members, appropriate Panel
members, Wing/Center CCs, and others as invited.
   3.2. (480ISRW) Council. The Wing Council is the senior-level, corporate advisory body to
   the 480 ISR WG/CC. Although not required, the Council may be convened to deliberate on
   issues and advise the 480 ISR WG/CC. Board meetings/video teleconferencing (VTC) will
   be coordinated with the Corporate Process Secretariat (CPS), 480 ISR WG/XPP. No
   decision-level programming or budgetary actions should reach the 480 ISR WG/CC without

   thorough vetting through the corporate process. Normal corporate decision processes consist
   of 480 ISR WG/CV presenting to the Council the Board recommendation for 480 ISR
   WG/CC approval.         When deliberation is required, advisors will present their
   recommendations and the Commander will make the final decision.
480 ISR WG Council advisors are as follows:

Figure 1. (480ISRW) 480 ISR WG Corporate Structure.




      3.2.1. The Special Programs Oversight Committee (SPOC) is a separate and distinct
      decision making body from the AFC. It is the Senior Air Force review committee for
      oversight of resource allocation, management, security, and execution of all Air Force
      special access programs (SAPs), excluding the National Foreign Intelligence Program.
      The SPOC is chaired by the SECAF (see figure 1).
      3.2.1. (480ISRW) The 480ISR WG/CC is the final approving authority for
      programming and budgetary issues.
      3.2.2. (Added-480ISRW) When the Council is convened, each agenda item will have a
      designated issue or process sponsor. The sponsor will provide the CPS briefing slides
      and read-aheads in the established format no later than (NLT) three working days prior to
      the Council meeting. During the meeting, the sponsor will provide a recorder to take
      meeting minutes (in the established format) that will include Council decisions and
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                              15


       actions. Sponsors will forward the minutes to the CPS NLT three business days after the
       Council has met. The CPS will forward the minutes within one business day to the 480
       ISR WG/CV for validation and approval. The CPS will publish the approved minutes on
       the 480 ISR WG Corporate Process Sharepoint Folder.
   3.3. Air Force Board (AFB). The AFB provides flag-level (1-2 star and civilian
   equivalent) review, evaluation, and recommendations within the same broad categories as the
   AFC. Members are selected by their AFC counterpart and are responsible for preparing their
   principal for AFC meetings. Additional members of the AFB are advisory and represent
   programs with Air Force Total Obligation Authority (TOA) and a combination of unique
   functional expertise. Additionally, panel chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are present,
   each representing mission and functional areas of Air Force expertise. Topics should be
   limited to important matters requiring corporate consideration and resolution. Its ultimate
   strength lies in its broad representative span that allows thorough vetting of issues before
   elevating the most critical issues to the AFC. Additionally, the AFB directs the focus of the
   AFG in resolving issues, refines AFG developed recommendations for submission to the
   AFC, and expedites Directorate-level coordination on significant issues. The AFB is chaired
   by Director of Programs, HQ USAF/A8P, with the Associate Director as his back up, and co-
   chaired by Deputy Assistant Secretary (Financial Management) (SAF/FMB), on non-budget
   issues. During budget formulation and execution, and during the Budget Review cycle, it is
   chaired by SAF/FMB.
Board membership includes representatives from:
HQ USAF: A1 | A2 | A3/5 | A4/7 | A8 | A9 | HC | JA | RE | SG | TE

SAF: AA | AG | AQ | FM | GC | IA | IE | IG | LL | PA | XC | USA | ANG

Advisory members include: AF/A1M | AF/A7C | AF/A8X
   3.3. (AFISRA) Board. The AFISRA Board serves as the enterprise-level corporate body,
   and is responsible for developing decision recommendations and information issues for
   Council consideration. The Board can also provide direction/guidance to the Group. When
   convened, the Board will have a designated sponsor (usually the Chair for the Group); the
   sponsor will, through the AFISRA/A5/8/9 Executive, schedule the Board meetings via VTC
   or locally. The sponsor is responsible to provide read-aheads in the established format no
   later than three working days prior to the Board meeting. During the meeting, the sponsor
   will provide a recorder to take meeting minutes (in established format) that will include
   Board decisions and actions. The sponsor will forward the minutes to the AFISRA/DS no
   later than three working days after the Board has met. Upon approval by the AFISRA/DS,
   the sponsor will post the approved minutes on the AFISRA Corporate Structure Sharepoint
   site. The AFISRA/CV chairs the Board and may direct the AFISRA/CA to serve as chair in
   his/her absence.
Board membership includes representatives from:

(Advisors for R&D investment issues: AFISRA Wings/Centers and others as invited.)
   3.3. (480ISRW) Board. The 480 ISR WG Board serves as the enterprise-level corporate
   body, and is responsible for developing decision recommendations and information issues for
   the 480 ISR WG/CV to present to the Wing Council. Further, the Board provides
   direction/guidance to the Wing Panel. Finally, it oversees major POM exercises that shape
   the Future Years’ Defense Program (FYDP) for all National Intelligence Program (NIP) and
   Military Intelligence Program (MIP) activities. Meetings of the Board can also serve as a
   venue to discuss new technologies/capabilities, demonstrations/exercise results,
   programming initiatives, resource actions, and personnel issues. The CPS will schedule
   Board meetings (via VTC), as necessary.
480 ISR WG Board membership includes representatives from:

TD | DO | XP | FM | CE | XC | MS | LG | 27 IS | Groups
       3.3.1. The Investment Budget Review Committee (IBRC) chaired by SAF/FMBI
       (General Officer equivalent), assists the AFC/AFB in evaluating investment
       appropriations and accounts in the year of execution, while the Operating Budget Review
       Committee (OBRC) chaired by SAF/FMBO (General Officer equivalent) assists in
       evaluating the program budgeting and execution of the Operations and Maintenance
       (O&M) appropriation in the year of execution (see figure 1).
       3.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) The Board for research & development investment issues has
       slightly different membership; it consists of senior technical advisors within the
       development community and the staff. Air Force Research Laboratory – Information
       Directorate and other research laboratories may participate as advisors to present
       technologies that are under development. Representation from the MAJCOMs helps to
       ensure relevancy of proposed initiatives to operational requirements. The R&DIB makes
       ―go-no go‖ and prioritization recommendations on investment projects. The R&DIB
       validates project manager’s priorities as presented by the Research and Development
       Investment Group (R&DIG). The R&DIB makes recommendations to the AFISRA
       Council for R&D technology investment decisions.
       3.3.3. (Added-480ISRW) The 480 ISR WG/CV chairs the Board and may direct 480
       ISR WG/TD, XP or FM to serve as meeting chair in his/her absence.
       3.3.4. (Added-480ISRW) Each Board agenda item will have a designated sponsor from
       one of the Panels. The sponsor will provide the CPS briefing slides and read-aheads in
       the established format NLT three working days prior to the Board meeting. During the
       meeting, the office sponsoring the meeting will provide a recorder to take meeting
       minutes (in the established format) that will include Board decisions and actions. The
       CPS will compile the meeting minutes and forward them within one business day to the
       480 ISR WG/CV for validation and approval. The CPS will publish and post the
       approved minutes on the 480 ISR WG Corporate Process Sharepoint folder.
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                               17


   3.4. Air Force Group (AFG). The AFG provides the AFB and senior-level leadership (O-6
   and civilian equivalents) a forum for initial corporate review and evaluation on appropriate
   issues within the same broad categories as both the AFB and AFC. The AFG is the first level
   of the AFCS that integrates the Air Force mission, mission support areas, and capabilities
   into a balanced Air Force program. Members are selected by their AFB counterpart or two-
   letter sponsors and are responsible for preparing their principal for AFB or AFC meetings.
   Its ultimate strength lies in its broad representative span that allows thorough vetting of
   issues before being elevated to the AFB or AFC for review and deliberation. Like the AFB
   and AFC, the AFG provides a forum for expeditious Division-level coordination on
   significant issues.
   3.4. (AFISRA) Group. The AFISRA Group serves as the first point for an integrated
   priority, or course of action recommendation. The Group will submit their recommendations
   to the Board for follow-on action. Meetings are scheduled on an as needed basis and may be
   held via VTC to include all necessary participants. Any AFISRA Directorate may request to
   convene a Group meeting. The AFISRA Group chair is designated based on the issue or
   process that the Group is meeting for (example: Group Chair for POM process is A5/8/9; for
   a MILCON issue A4/7; for a budget execution issue FM; etc. etc.). When convened, the
   Group Chair will be the designated sponsor for the Group. The sponsor will schedule the
   Group meetings and is responsible to provide read-aheads in the established format no later
   than three working days prior to the Group meeting. During the meeting, the sponsor will
   provide a recorder to take meeting minutes (in established format) that will include Group
   decisions, actions and recommendations. The sponsor will post the signed minutes on the
   AFISRA Corporate Structure Sharepoint site no later than five business days after the Group
   has met. Representatives must be authorized to speak for their Commander/Director.
Group membership includes representatives from:

AFISRA: A1 | A2 | A3 | A4/7 | A5/8/9 | A6 | FM | HC | HO | IG | JA | PA | SE | SG | SO | CR
(Members for R&D investment issues: AFISRA A2 | A3 | A5R | A6 | FM|MAJCOM/A2s)

AF MAJCOMs as appropriate.

Group Advisors include:

AFISRA Wings/Centers and others as invited.
(Advisors for R&D investment issues: AFRL-Information Directorate and AFISRA/JA)

The Group chairman may also request subject matter experts (SME) to serve as group advisors.
       3.4.1. The AFG is chaired by AF/A8P Deputy except for purposes of budget formulation
       and execution to include the Budget Estimate Submission (BES), Budget Review (BR),
       and the President’s Budget (PB) when it is chaired by SAF/FMBP. Additionally, Panel
       Chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are present during AFG meetings. Panel briefs to
       the AFG require minimum of four briefer support chairs (POC + 3 AOs).
AFG include representatives from:
HQ USAF: A1 | A1M | A1S | A2 | A3/5 | A3O | A3S | A4P | A7C | A7S | A8F | A8P | A8X |

SAF: AA | AG | AQ | FM | FMC | GC | IA | IE | IG | LL | PA | USA | ANG | XC
       3.4.2. The five Mission and nine Mission Support Panels are the Air Force centers of
       expertise for their areas, and they are the first level of corporate deliberation in the AFCS.
       The Panels serve as the initial point of entry for issues arising from the Program Element
       Monitors (PEMs), Integrated Process Team (IPT), MAJCOMS, FOAs, or DRUs that
       require AFCS review. Panels review and develop options for presentation to the AFG.
       3.4.3. The Special Programs Review Group (SPRG) serves as the working-level advisory
       panel responsible for integration of requirements and allocation of resources across the
       SAP portfolio.      The SPRG matches resources to requirements and makes
       recommendations to the SPOC Executive Secretary for presentation to the SPOC. The
       SPRG is chaired by SAF/AQL and co-chaired by AF/A8PE (see figure 1).
       3.4.4. In addition to permanent SAF/FMB representation on each mission and mission
       support panel, the AFCS requires SAF/FMB appropriations manager coordination on
       each approved Disconnect (D), Initiative (I), or Offset (O). Appropriation manager
       cooperation at the panel level ensures proper budget level detail review and develops
       information requirements for the creation of J-Book submissions. An established
       working relationship between the panels and the appropriation managers ensures funding
       ramps are avoided when possible and explained to the proper level of fidelity, when
       required for mission needs. This relationship also protects AFCS intent when last
       minute, undistributed cuts emerge during the fall review. Appropriation managers, with
       the help of the panels, can assist in the distribution and programmatic assessment on non-
       programmatic cuts. Panel Chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are members of the IBRC
       and OBRC processes, as well.
       3.4.5. (Added-AFISRA) The Group for research & development investment issues has
       slightly different membership and convenes to consider future or planned projects, to
       review ongoing projects, spend plans and deliverables. AF organizations with intelligence
       R&D requirements will be invited to present those requirements to the R&DIG for
       funding consideration. AFISRA subordinate units will submit requirements to
       AFISRA/A2 for sponsorship within the R&DIG.
   3.5. AF Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Champions. The AF CONOPS Champions
   assess the portfolio of Air Force through the Integrated Capabilities Review and Risk
   Assessments (CRRA) process and evaluate the risk of Panel proposals and issues to the
   execution of the AF CONOPS. Together, the Panels and AF CONOPS Champions represent
   a body of highly qualified experts in program portfolios that align with capability
   requirements defined by the AF CONOPS and capability objectives identified through the
   CRRA process. The Panel structure and organizational chairmanship is as follows:

NOTE: Special Access Required (SAR) panel, AF/A8PE-SAR, serves as the SPRG
representative to the AF Board and Air Force Group (see figure 1).
       3.5.1. (Added-AFISRA) Panels. Panels address mid/long-term operational, support,
       resource, and legal requirements for specific programs. They develop and document
       capabilities shortfalls / sustainment / modernization resource requirements for address by
       the AFISRA Corporate Structure. The Panels also develop plans to integrate current and
       future capabilities into various AF, national intelligence agency, and AFISRA
       architectures.      The Panels will submit operational/resource initiatives and
       recommendations to the Group. The Group Chair may call upon the various Panels to
       support corporate process actions requiring subject matter expertise. These Panels’ POCs
       will forward their agenda item request to the Group Chair for inclusion in the corporate
       process. Finally, ad hoc Panels may be directed to address short-term actions for
       corporate review/action. Each Panel will have an AFISRA chairperson and a Director
       and AFISRA/DS approved charter. The charter will include each Panel’s purpose
       (deliverables), the directorate acting as Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR),
       membership requirement, and meeting schedule. AFISRA/DS will review/validate all
       charters on an annual basis. The Panel Chairs will maintain the charter on the AFISRA
       Corporate Structure Sharepoint site. See attachments 10 through 16 for Panel charters.

       3.5.1. (480ISRW) Panels. The 480 ISR Wing Panels address mid/long term operational
       support and resource requirements for Wing programs. They develop and document
       resource strategies for addressing Wing capability gaps and recommend prioritizations
       for requested program adjustments. Each panel is an action-officer-level forum and
       serves as the initial step in an integrated priority recommendation. The Panel is
       responsible for identifying, reviewing, validating, and prioritizing resource submissions,
       planning activities, programming initiatives and special project actions. Wing leadership
       may direct the standup of ad hoc Panels to address short-term actions for corporate
       review/action. Panels will submit their recommendation to the Board for action and, if
       approved, for final Council decision. Meetings are scheduled on an ―as needed basis‖
       and may be held via VTC to include all necessary participants. Each Panel will have a
       Wing chairperson and a 480 ISR WG/DS approved charter. Standing Panel charters are
       included in Attachments 17-22 to this supplement
          3.5.1.1. (Added-480ISRW) Facilities Panel: Chaired by 480IW/CE. Members

          representatives from the Wing two letters, Groups, civilian personnel, contracting,
          legal, and financial management offices. The Manpower Panel manages the
          unfunded manpower requirements process. It evaluates and validates all unfunded
          requirement submissions and groups/prioritizes them into established categories (i.e.
          Operations Mission, Direct Mission Support, Mission Support, Others). It assesses
          the impact of all submissions and associated manpower requirements on current and
          future force structure and ensures any contract requirements are legal and meet both
          Air Force and AFISRA restrictions (inherently governmental workload versus
          contractible workload).

         consideration.
  3.6. Program Element (PE). Each Air Force PE is assigned a single PEM to act as the
  focal point for that PE. A PEM is usually assigned from within the Secretariat or Air Staff,
  based on the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for that PE. HQ AF/A8PE is the
  approval authority and the AF point of contact for all PE actions. PE documentation is
  maintained in the AF FYDP Structure Management System (AF FSMS). PEMs establish
  accounts in this web based system and are the AF POC for all PE actions. PEMs are primary
  advocates for their PEs, addressing issues and coordinating functional concerns across
  various staffs. Air Staff PEMs are expected to be the subject matter expert at the Air Staff
  level on their PEs. In conjunction with the Mission/Mission Support Panels, they prepare
  and update various planning, programming, and budgeting documents within the PPBE
  process.
     3.6.1. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Capability Advocate (CA) Duties. Directors
     responsible for control of programs will assign a Capability Advocate to manage each
     program. CAs are responsible for monitoring resource allocation within their programs
     and for implementing AFISRA program controls. CAs serve as the focal point for all
 22                           AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010


      staff actions affecting their Programs: force structure and manpower; funding profiles for
      all appropriations; development, test, procurement, and deployment schedules; concepts
      of operations and technical performance requirements for all programs, elements and
      systems. CAs will prepare and coordinate PPBE actions associated with their assigned
      Program, including Program Change Requests, Program Change Proposals, initiatives,
      disconnects, and offsets. Particular attention must be paid to fund operations and
      sustainment of new or modified systems. CAs are responsible for preparing many of the
      products such as the Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System
      (RAPIDS) slides and bullet background papers (BBP) used by the AFISRA corporate
      structure during various PPBE processes. CAs will present a complete program review to
      the appropriate AFISRA Panel during the POM development cycle or when requested by
      the AFISRA Group. This review will be a comprehensive, objective briefing that includes
      detailed breakouts of all appropriations, requirements, production schedules, system or
      modification costs, capabilities and bed-down requirements, funding priorities, and
      content overlap with other programs. AFISRA CAs should advocate for their programs
      consistent with AFISRA corporate positions based on validated Air Force CONOPS,
      technical requirements, AFISRA priorities, and program guidance. AFISRA CAs will
      not present/submit to HHQ or AFISRA staff, wing or center an official ISR
      position/policy without coordinating through the appropriate Directorate. For example,
      HHQ financial taskings that impact a specific program should be submitted by FM vice
      the various CAs.
      3.6.2. (Added-AFISRA) Capability Advocate (CA) Training. HQ AFISRA/A8P
      provides PPBE training as part of AFISRA CA training. PPBE training includes an
      overview of DoD, USAF, and AFISRA PPBE processes with an emphasis on AFISRA
      CA duties and responsibilities. In addition, AFISRA/A8P can provide training on
      RAPIDS software. Prior to each major program exercise, AFISRA/A8P provides ―just-in-
      time‖ training to CAs--formats, timelines, and specific actions required for the exercise.
      NOTE: Directorates may provide or fund additional training in formal offsite courses.
      3.6.3. (Added-AFISRA) Program Folders. CAs will maintain folders on each
      assigned Program. Program folders should contain relevant USAF Force and Financial
      Plan (F&FP) and Program Documents (see AFI16-501, Para. 4), bullet background
      papers (BBP), briefing slides, and RAPIDS change control sheets from the latest
      President’s Budget (PB) or major program exercise (POM/BES, PCP/BCP). Maximize
      the use of electronic media. Classification of folders shall be governed by DoD 5200.1-
      PH, DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents; AFI 31-401, Information Security
      Program Management; USAF Force and Financial Plan Data Security Classification
      Guide; and the Air Force Planning and Programming Instruction (PPI).
      3.6.4. (Added-AFISRA) Capability Advocate (CA) Rosters. HQ AFISRA/A8P will
      maintain a roster of program elements and CAs/alternate CAs posted on the Air Force
      ISR Agency Corporate Structure Sharepoint site. Directors will provide periodic updates
      to AFISRA/A8P to ensure accuracy of the CA roster.
4. Documentation.
   4.1. Force and Financial Plan (F&FP). The USAF F&FP system fuses with the ABIDES
   database interactive tool to develop and submit the Air Force FYDP to OSD. It contains
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                            23


  information on resources such as military and civilian manpower, flying hours, aircraft
  authorizations, and inventory and procurement quantities, as well as dollars. The F&FP
  provides considerable expansion of details over the FYDP for Air Force programs.
  Modifications to the Air Force Program after submission to OSD require prior approval from
  OSD, and are implemented only with specific direction from HQ USAF. Requests to modify
  the Air Force Program should refer to the F&FP and its resources data.
  4.2. Program. The Air Force disseminates the Program through program documents. The
  principal program documents and the supplementary program documents list particular
  resource commodities of the overall programs and their OPRs (see Attachment 2).
  Responsible HQ USAF organizations publish the principal program documents after the PB
  submission. They may also publish these documents after a significant amended budget
  submission or any time OSD directs an additional update. These program documents are
  categorized by PE (where appropriate), consistent with the USAF F&FP, and are
  implemented only with specific and separate authority from HQ USAF.
  4.3. Program Change Requests (PCRs). PCRs are used to request an operational or fiscal
  change outside the normal PPBE cycle that is mission critical to accomplish in the execution
  or budget years. Changes to the Air Force Program after execution and budget years will be
  part of Program Agency initiatives or disconnects during the next POM programming phase.
  General guidelines for Air Force PCRs are outlined in Attachment 3.
     4.3.1. PCRs are submitted as fully funded or as no cost. Reprogramming is necessary if
     a PCR directs the transfer of funds between appropriations rather than absorbing the cost
     within an appropriation. If the cost of the PCR is absorbed within the appropriation,
     reprogramming is still required when moving funds between program elements.
     Examples are transferring Air Force O&M to Air National Guard O&M, or using
     procurement funds to pay an O&M bill. When this occurs in the current year, HQ USAF,
     OSD, and congressional approvals are required to support the reprogramming (use of
     funds in other than original appropriation submitted to and enacted by Congress). The
     effective implementation date of PCR actions will be delayed until approved by OSD and
     Congress. Failure to do so may result in an Anti-Deficiency Act Violation (DoD
     7000.14R, Vol. 14, Administrative Control of Appropriations and Anti-Deficiency Act
     Violations). When a PCR realigns funds between appropriations for the budget years,
     prior approval from HQ USAF and OSD is required.
     4.3.2. Requests for reprogramming/realignment to fund a PCR are not automatically
     approved. Reprogramming within or between appropriations, within or over dollar
     thresholds, or involving Congressional special interest line items all require special
     oversight. HQ USAF, OSD, or Congress can deny the reprogramming/realignment
     actions. MAJCOMs must weigh the risk associated with identifying sources to offset a
     program change with the benefit of implementing the PCR outside of the programming or
     budgeting cycle. There is less risk when the PCR is sourced within the same
     appropriation.
  4.4. DoD and USAF Program Document Processing and Distribution:
     4.4.1. Program Elements are primary data elements in the FYDP. They are organized
     into 11 Major Force Programs (MFP)--6 combat force oriented programs, and 5 support
     programs. The AFCS assigns PEs to IPTs and Panels according to their force structure or
24                           AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010


     support function. Since some PEs may affect more than one Panel, cross-Panel
     coordination is an absolute requirement. The functional DCS, or the Secretariat
     equivalent functional manager, will coordinate assignment changes to existing PEs for
     approval by SECAF. PE directives are located at Attachment 7.
     4.4.2. PPBE documents and supporting databases are not disclosed outside DoD or other
     governmental agencies (e.g., OMB) not directly involved in the defense planning and
     resource allocation process. The OSD office responsible for the PPBE phase to which
     the document or database pertains will consider requests for exceptions on a case-by-case
     basis. The responsible offices are as follows: Under Secretary of Defense (Policy) for
     the Planning phase, the Under Secretary of Defense, (Program Analysis and Evaluation)
     for the Programming phase, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) for the
     Budgeting phase [see DoD Instruction 7045.7]. The responsible OSD office coordinates
     and approves requests with the General Counsel.
     4.4.3. The Air Force, by request, distributes SECAF and CSAF approved PPBE
     documents and decisions to OSD and headquarters elements of the Departments of the
     Army and the Navy. Sub-elements of those departments that require information on Air
     Force programs should get it from their respective departmental headquarters. The Air
     Force distributes program documents internally on a strict "need-to-know" basis (see
     DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regulation, January 1997, and AFPD 31-
     4, Information Security, 1 September 1998).
     4.4.4. HQ USAF distributes program documents to directorates through Programming
     Agencies. With specific, fully justified requests from the Programming Agencies, HQ
     USAF may distribute documents directly to the subordinate commands immediately
     below MAJCOM level.
        4.4.4.1. HQ USAF/A8 controls the distribution for the principal program documents;
        the OPRs control supplementary documents (see Attachment 2).
        4.4.4.2. Send all requests for program documents through the Programming Agencies
        to the HQ USAF OPR. Do not use normal publications channels. Requests for new
        or increased distribution must:
            4.4.4.2.1. Be signed at the command’s directorate level.
            4.4.4.2.2. Identify the using agency.
            4.4.4.2.3. Justify the reason for the request.
            4.4.4.2.4. Identify the total number now being received in the command’s
            headquarters.
            4.4.4.2.5. Identify the Programming Agency’s focal point responsible for
            program document control.
            4.4.4.2.6. In determining total requirements, Programming Agencies should use
            focal points or classified libraries that can make copies available to several offices
            in order to minimize the number of copies needed.
            4.4.4.2.7. Using DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
            Management, Programming Agencies should reproduce parts of documents when
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                                25


             an individual office or subordinate command does not need the whole document.
  4.5. Education and Training (E&T) Requirements Determination Process. A key
  programming process is the E&T requirements determination process. E&T issues cut across
  all MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, with results that drive extensive programming actions and
  must follow certain timelines within the overarching PPBE process. It is important to
  establish a framework that Air Force agencies can work with to determine, document and
  fund E&T requirements. While the detailed sub-process guidance resides in other associated
  AFIs, Attachment 9 to this AFI provides the necessary overall framework for the E&T build.
  Air Force organizations are required to adhere to this framework and document those actions
  that drive programming actions.
  4.6. Limitations. Limit access to industrial firms under contract to the Air Force on a strict
  "need-to-know" basis as provided in DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 and DoD 5220.22-R,
  Industrial Security Regulation, December 1985 and AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program
  Management, 29 June 2005. Do not release entire documents. The USD(C) will consider
  requests on a case-by-case basis. The commander responsible for procuring material,
  supplies, or services from a contractor or bidder may release or disclose only the classified
  information required to perform the specific contract or to prepare a specific bid or quotation.

AFCS (Air Force Corporate Structure)—Embodies the corporate review process for HQ
USAF. It does not replace the functional staff but, rather, enhances it by allowing time critical or
time limited functional reviews at the appropriate levels. The deliberative components of the
Corporate Structure are the Air Force Council (AFC), the Air Force Board (AFB), the Air Force
Group (AFG), and the thirteen Mission and Mission Support Panels. This structure increases
management effectiveness and improves cross-functional decision-making by providing a forum
in which senior Air Force leadership can apply their collective judgment, experience, and
analysis to major programs, objectives, and issues. This process balances programs among
mission areas, between force structure and support, and between readiness, modernization, and
transformation. Additionally, this approach ensures the Air Force program is capabilities based
and supports the Joint warfighter. Only military or Department of Defense civilian personnel
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                                29


assigned to the Air Staff or Office of the Secretary of the Air Force may serve as members of the
corporate structure.
AFC (Air Force Council)—Advises and makes recommendations to the Chief of Staff and
Secretary on major matters, including the responsiveness of Air Force plans and programs to
national, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Air Force objectives. The
Vice Chief of Staff chairs the AFC. Membership is at the Deputy Chief of Staff (three-star)
level, corresponding Secretariat level, and selected Directorate (two-star) level (para 3.2).
AFB (Air Force Board)—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air Force Council
(AFC) on major programming and other staffing issues. In addition, the AFB conducts corporate
reviews of the resource allocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to
shape and refine proposals prior to presentation to the AFC. The AFB has decision authority for
issues submitted by the Air Force Group (AFG). The Director of Programs chairs the AFB,
except for purposes of budget formulation and execution to include the Program Budget Review
(PBR), Budget Review Cycle, and President’s Budget (PB), when the Deputy Assistant
Secretary (Budget) (SAF/FMB) chairs it. Membership is at the General officer/Senior Executive
Service level (para 3.3) but advisory members include the panel chairs, CONOPS Champions,
and those with special expertise.
AFG (Air Force Group)—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air Force Board
(AFB) on major programming and other staffing issues. Conducts corporate reviews of the
resource allocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to shape and
refine proposals prior to presentation to the AFB and the Air Force Council (AFC). The Deputy
Director of Programs chairs the AFG. Membership is at the Colonel/civilian equivalent level
(para 3.4), but advisory members include the panel chairs, CONOPS champions, and those with
special expertise. The AFG is the first level in the corporate structure that integrates the Air
Force mission, mission support areas, and capabilities into a balanced Air Force program.
Air Force Concept of Operation (AF CONOPS)— An Air Force Concept of Operations
delineates the highest service-level concept comprising a commander’s assumptions and intent to
achieve desired effects through the guided integration of capabilities and tasks that solve a
problem in an expected mission area.
AF CONOPS Champion— The Air Staff focal point for service-level CONOPS and the
capabilities described and required by that AF CONOPS. The Champion promotes the
attainment and sustainment of essential Air Force capabilities required to achieve the effects
needed by Joint Force Commanders (JFC) to fulfill their assigned missions. The Champion is
also responsible for leading the Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA) process,
advocating AF CONOPS, effects, and capabilities in all Department of Defense, Joint Staff, and
Air Staff capabilities-based planning processes, and informing the Air Force Corporate and the
Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System processes.
Air Force Mission/Mission Support Panel—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air
Force Group (AFG) on major programming and other issues. Conducts corporate reviews of the
resource allocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to shape and
refine proposals prior to the AFG. Serves as initial point of entry for all issues requiring
corporate review. Panels work closely with CONOPS Champions to ensure program capabilities
are consistent with Integrated Capabilities Review and Risk Assessments (CRRA). Chairs are
designated by appropriate Deputy Chief of Staff/Assistant Secretary (para 3.4.2).

Budget Year(s)—The year(s) following the current fiscal year, and for which the budget
estimate submission (BES) is prepared. For example, if the current fiscal year were FY 2005,
the budget year(s) would be FY 2006-07.
Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment— The Air Force process for identifying and
assessing the levels of capability needed to execute service-level concepts of operations,
determining the status of these capabilities to achieve desired effects, and recommending courses
of action to rectify overages, shortfalls, and gaps in the capability portfolio.
Disconnect—An approved program, which is unexecutable because of resource shortfalls.
Specific Air Force or Office of the Secretary of Defense Program Budget Decisions (PBDs) that
change the program content or pace in the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
cycle are not candidates for disconnects in the following year’s cycle.
D-22—Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Financial Management and
Comptroller, Directorate of Budget Operations (SAF/FMBO) Financial Plan exhibit used as a
vehicle to transfer Air Force Operations and Maintenance funds between commands to include
approved Program Change Request actions for the budget year but not included in the
President’s Budget submission.
EIAP (Environmental Impact Analysis Process)—The Air Force program that implements the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), and the requirements
for analysis of environmental effects abroad under Executive Order 12114. Specific procedures
are in AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, 12 March 2003.
Execution Year—The current fiscal year.
Fiscal Year (FY)—The 12-month period which begins 1 October of one year and ends 30
September of the next year.

Offsets—Resources that are offered to "pay" for a Program Change Request action, disconnect,
or initiative.
Out Years—The years of the Air Force Program not included in the execution or budget years.
Program Change Request (PCR)—Document used to request an out-of-cycle change to the
FYDP program structure (during the execution and budget years). Can be initiated by
Headquarters USAF, the MAJCOMs, or other programming agencies. Changes to the Air Force
Program that begin beyond the execution and budget years should be part of Program Agency
initiatives or disconnects during the next programming phase.
Prior Year (PY)—The fiscal year immediately preceding the current year (last completed fiscal
year). Also referred to as Past Year.
USAF F&FP (USAF Force and Financial Plan)—The database that describes the Future Years
Defense Plan. The Air Force portion of the DoD FYDP, consisting of a series of classified
volumes, which shows (by program element code), a projection of the forces, manpower, and
dollar resources approved for the Air Force. Interaction with the F&FP is accomplished using
the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) program. Changes to

                     PROGRAM CHANGE REQUEST GUIDANCE

A3.1. General Guidelines for Air Force PCRs.
   A3.1.1. Final approval authority is SECAF.
   A3.1.2. Use PCR actions to make off cycle corrections to programs. Each PCR must be a
   stand-alone action that zero-balances in all years of the FYDP, so the PCR does not drive a
   bill to the Air Force.
   A3.1.3. Gaining and losing MAJCOMs must agree to exact dollar amount of request before
   submitting it to HQ USAF. PCRs will not be accepted without appropriate offsets identified
   for the budget and execution years as well as throughout the FYDP. All costs, to include
   tails, must be considered. Coordination between MAJCOM/FMs and MAJCOM/A8s is
   expected and should be documented for reference.
   A3.1.4. Identify adjustments to total Air Force Officer and Enlisted end strength by fiscal
   year and display funding by fiscal year. Transfers of end strengths between agencies and
   commands do not result in a change to the Air Force Military Personnel Appropriation unless
   positions are being added to or deleted from the Air Force manpower file.
   A3.1.5. After coordinating within Programming Agencies, submit PCRs to HQ USAF/A8P
   with informational copies to SAF/FMB, other Programming Agencies, and HQ USAF
   Mission/Mission Support Panels, as required. Submit PCRs by message (Attachment 4) or as
   an e-mail attachment (Attachments 5 and 6). Organizations with Defense Messaging System
   (DMS) capability should submit the PCR as a text file (Attachment 6) attached to a DMS
   message prepared according to standards.
   A3.1.6. Coordinate all end strength adjustments with HQ USAF/A1M. SAF/FMBOP will
   provide budgetary figures for manpower requirements.
   A3.1.7. Include in each PCR a detailed explanation of the costs involved for all
   appropriations/fund sources and Foreign Military Sales (FMS)/Security Assistance impacts.
   For Procurement Accounts, in addition to the PE, include the Budget Program (BP). Include
   out year costs and BP for PCR actions affecting out years. Coordinate PCR cost estimates
   and savings with appropriate MAJCOM or equivalent Financial Management and
   Comptroller staff prior to submission to USAF/A8P.
   A3.1.8. Identify in each PCR the source of cost estimates in each appropriation fund source.
   Specify offsets within each appropriation/fund source for the execution and budget year and
   throughout the FYDP. Offsets generated by FMS or Security Assistance programs must also
   be identified. Each offset will contain funding information to the program element and cost
   element detail. For Procurement Accounts, in addition to the PE, include the BP. Each PCR
   will be a stand-alone action. HQ USAF will reject using offsets from prior or subsequent
   PCRs. HQ USAF will return PCRs without action that do not contain sufficient offsets.
   A3.1.9. To identify PCRs, include the initiating organization name (Air Combat Command,
   National Guard Bureau, etc.), current fiscal year, and a sequential two-digit number (e.g.,
   AMC 08-01 is the first PCR AMC submits in Fiscal Year 08). AF/A8PE, as the Office of
 34                           AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010


   Primary Responsibility, will assign PCR numbers for HQ USAF generated PCRs. The prefix
   will be HAF, followed by the current fiscal year and sequence number (e.g., HAF 08-01).
   A3.1.10. Coordinate all PCRs with Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A4) and identify
   potential support problems prior to sending them to HQ USAF. AFMC provides impacts
   then HQ USAF optimizes the bed down plan.
   A3.1.11. Each PCR will state that the requester has initiated an Environmental Impact
   Analysis Process (EIAP), as directed by AFI 32-7061, Environmental Impact Analysis
   Process, and as promulgated in AFPD 32-70, will identify which Program Agencies have
   coordinated on the PCR.
A3.2. PCR Request Message.
   A3.2.1. Programming agencies will submit PCRs as a message or as a text file attached to a
   DMS or e-mail message. See Attachment 4 for a sample request message. See Attachment 5
   for a sample e-mail or DMS attachment request. See Attachment 6 for sample e-mail. As a
   minimum, the message will contain the following elements:
   A3.2.2. Address to HQ USAF/A8P/A8PE. Send information copies to all interested
   MAJCOMs, the other PCR Programming Agencies, SAF/FMBP, HQ USAF Directorates, the
   National Guard Bureau, and the Air Force Reserve. HQ AFMC/A4 must be an addressee on
   all messages that affect force structure and flying hours.
   A3.2.3. The Programming Agency PCR number and title.
   A3.2.4. Brief summary of proposed changes and why it is mission critical to accomplish
   them in the budget/execution years versus waiting for the next POM.
   A3.2.5. Coordination obtained with other MAJCOMs, Combatant Commanders, etc.
   A3.2.6. Force structure, manpower, and flying hour displays of current program and of
   proposed changes by quarter of each fiscal year to include out years. When manpower slots
   are added, deleted, or transferred, display cost impact by fiscal year. Coordinate any
   manpower cost data with SAF/FMBOP and note that such data are only approximately
   correct.
   A3.2.7. The cost summary of proposed program should not include program element,
   appropriation/fund, cost element detail, and BP (for Procurement Accounts) including out
   years. As a minimum, identify Flying Hour, Base Operating Support (BOS), Operations and
   Maintenance (O&M), Support Equipment, Environmental Compliance, Real Property
   Maintenance (RPM), Military Family Housing (MFH), Communications, Military
   Construction (MILCON), and Permanent Change of Station (PCS) costs. If no impact, so
   state.
   A3.2.8. Summary of proposed offsets to include program element, appropriation and cost
   element detail including out years. Identify cost savings, over and above proposed offsets,
   resulting from proposed program.        Identify offsets generated by Foreign Military
   Sales/Security Assistance Programs.
   A3.2.9. Discussion of the proposed plan, including the pros and cons of such areas as
   operational effects, combat enhancements, supportability issues, manpower issues, and
   Congressional concerns.
AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010                                                35


   A3.2.10. Statement that EIAP actions have been initiated and a properly completed AF Form
   813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, is being forwarded under separate cover.
   A3.2.11. Identify any requirement for public announcement, host nation notification, and/or
   Congressional actions.
   A3.2.12. The action officer’s name, office symbol, and telephone number.
A3.3. Programming Agency Actions.
   A3.3.1. After SECAF/CSAF has reviewed each PCR, HQ USAF/A8P will notify SAF/FMB
   and the appropriate Programming Agency of approval or disapproval status and ensure that
   the appropriate database and Programming documents are updated during the next available
   budget exercise.
A3.4. PCR Approval or Disapproval Message.
   A3.4.1. Address the PCR approval or disapproval message to the submitting MAJCOM with
   information copies to all affected geographic Combatant Commanders, all interested
   MAJCOMs, the Secretariat and HQ USAF Directorates, the National Guard Bureau, and the
   Air Force Reserve (if required). HQ AFMC/A4 must be an addressee on all messages that
   affect force structure and flying hours so they can ensure the changes are incorporated into
   the buy, repair, and distribution decisions. PCR approval messages will contain the
   following:
   A3.4.2. Current Program. Force structure, manpower, and flying hour displays of current
   program by quarter of each fiscal year to include out years.
   A3.4.3. Approved Program. Force structure, manpower, and flying hour displays of the
   approved program by quarter of each year to include out years.

Subject:         ACC PCR 03-07

Attached is ACC PCR 03-07 concerning the proposed transfer of F-16 aircraft from Shaw to Luke. It was
released by HQ ACC/A8, Gen Smith.



Note: This is an example of an e-mail to which a PCR would be attached. Follow these guidelines when
using this method to submit a PCR:

1. Send the e-mail to exactly the same commands/offices that are on the addressee list on the message
itself (see next page). If the office has a Workflow or SCATS inbox, use that. If not, send it to the office’s
Executive Officer. The sender must determine which is appropriate for each addressee, and must
determine and verify the e-mail address for each addressee. All HAF Workflow and SCATS inboxes used
in this example are correct as of this writing. Other addresses shown are representative and only for
example purposes. Individual names are imaginary.

2. Do not put the PCR in the body of the e-mail itself, since text formatting is often lost when doing so.
Make the PCR an attachment instead (see Attachment 5).

3. Make the attachment a stand-alone PCR, to include all addressee information.

4. Do not submit an official PCR unless it has been released by the appropriate authority.

5. When e-mailing a "working draft" PCR to the HAF AO for coord, mark the PCR "DRAFT".

6. Note Classification – SEE CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE, para 13.

                                   PROGRAM ELEMENTS

A7.1. Creating or Changing Program Elements.
   A7.1.1. To create or change PEs, send requests to appropriate Air Staff Panel. The Air Staff
   Panel submits the request into the current/processing database and coordinates with HQ
   USAF/A8PE. HQ USAF/A8PE coordinates with the Secretariat, and then submits the
   request to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Director,
   Program Analysis and Evaluation, for approval. The Air Staff Panel will submit the Air
   Force Program (AFP) request via the current PE database. HQ USAF/A8PE will confirm
   AFP request with Panel Chair. Once the request is approved, HQ USAF/A8PE will notify
   Panel and ensure the AFP is added to appropriate databases. When submitting a request, be
   sure to include the following information:
   A7.1.2. State whether the request is to create a new PE, or to change an existing PE.
   A7.1.3. State the title of the PE.
   A7.1.4. State justification for why this PE is needed, or why it should be modified. Include
   a recommendation for panel assignment.
   A7.1.5. PE Description.
   A7.1.6. The action officer’s name, office, and telephone number.
   A7.1.7. State the AFP code. If the AFP does not exist submit an AFP Request Form
   (attachment 8) along with PE request to the Air Staff Panel.
A7.2. Air Force Programs (AFP).
   A7.2.1. AFP is a time phased set of resources that supports the activities that operate,
   modify, sustain or acquire weapon or support systems, or relate to the functions that supports
   the infrastructure needed to operate, maintain and acquire forces, and acquire and train
   personnel. The resources include dollars, forces and manpower.
NOTE: AFPs are only for internal AF deliberative processes.
   A7.2.2. An AFP consists of a six-digit program code, title, and description in the F&FP
   system of the ABIDES database tables and in the AF FSMS. The main purpose of the code
   is to provide programmatic insight into the F&FP database. In addition, the coding structure
   facilitates rapid viewing of groupings that cut across programs, program elements, and
   Panels. Examples of these cross-cutters are Depot Purchase Equipment Maintenance
   (DPEM), Aerospace Vehicle Petroleum (AVPOL), Military and Civilian Pay, and Military
   Construction. No program code will be created without identifying dollars to support it.
   A7.2.3. Administration of AFP: HQ USAF/A8PE shall review all AFP additions, deletions,
   and changes.
   A7.2.4. Process for Creating or Changing AFPs:
       A7.2.4.1. The Panel must receive authorization from Panel Chair before submitting AFP
       code within current database for approval.
46                           AFI16-501_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2010


     A7.2.4.2. The request should state the definition and justification for the AFP.
     A7.2.4.3. State the current program you are moving dollars from only when applicable.
     A7.2.4.4. State the PE and Appropriation (Appn) associated with the proposed program.
     A7.2.4.5. Coordinate with Appn Mgr(s), Program Element Monitor(s) and MAJCOM(s).
     A7.2.4.6. Panel must submit a Zero Balance Transfer (ZBT) with a temporary AFP code,
     when appropriate.
     A7.2.4.7. The Panel will propose an AFP Group and AFP Roll-up code when required.
  A7.2.5. AF/A8PE will confirm AFP request with Panel Chair. Once the request is approved,
  AF/A8PE will notify Panel and ensure the AFP is added to appropriate databases.
