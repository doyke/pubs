                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. The Royal Air Force (RAF) Lakenheath airfield consists of the runway, all taxiways
and parking aprons, and the North Perimeter road.
1.2. The goal of the airfield driving program is to create and maintain a safe airfield
environment. Safe operation of motor vehicles on the airfield is essential to aircraft operations
and maintenance. The presence of motor vehicles on the airfield is a clear and definite danger to
both aircraft and personnel. Carelessness, haste, and a disregard for established safety standards
are the primary sources of aircraft or vehicle collisions, incidents and personal injury with the
use of motor vehicles on the airfield.
1.3. Personnel assigned to duties that require airfield driving will be trained and tested
prior to driving on the airfield. Only vehicles and drivers required for official duties will be
trained, tested, and granted airfield access.
1.4. All personnel on the airfield are responsible for monitoring vehicle safety, detecting
unauthorized vehicles, and immediately reporting airfield driving violations to Airfield
Management (AM).

4.2. Runway Markings. The runway edge is marked with solid white lines running the length
of the runway. The centerline is marked with a dashed white line running down the middle of
the length of the runway. White numerals (“06” and “24”) at the ends of each runway mark the
designation.
4.3. Runway Edge Lights. The runway edge is marked with white and amber lights. These
high intensity lights run the length of the runway and identify the runway edge. See figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1. Runway Edge Lights.




4.4. Runway Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Hold Position Markings. Four parallel yellow
stripes that extend across the entire width of a taxiway, 150 feet from the edge of the runway.
The two lines closest to the runway are dashed and the other two are solid (see figure 4.2.) This
marking identifies the boundary of the CMA. No vehicle will pass this marking without Control
Tower approval. See Attachment 3.
4.5. Runway VFR Hold Position and Runway Guard (Wig-Wag) Lights. Runway guard
lights, commonly known as “Wig-Wag” lights, are pairs of elevated flashing amber lights
installed on either side of the VFR hold position marking. See figure 4.2.
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                         17


Figure 4.2. VFR Hold Position Markings.




The primary purpose of Wig-Wag lights is to enhance runway/taxiway intersections during low
visibility conditions. See Figure 4.3.

Figure 4.3. Runway Guard (Wig-Wag) Lights.




4.6. Runway VFR Hold Position Signs.
   4.6.1. VFR hold position signs have white inscriptions on a red background. They are
   located on the left side of a taxiway (or both sides if taxiway is wider than 150 feet), adjacent
   to the VFR runway hold position marking. See Figure 4.3. This sign indicates the boundary
   of the CMA and helps drivers identify the CMA at night or when the taxiway is covered with
   snow.
   4.6.2. Hold position signs are Mandatory Signs. Mandatory signs are provided when an
   aircraft or vehicles must follow an instruction. No vehicle will pass these signs without
   Control Tower approval. See Attachment 3.
4.7. Runway Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Hold Position Markings.
   4.7.1. Two horizontal lines with double vertical stripes spaced 2 feet apart with a 10 feet
   spacing between the pairs; lines are 1-foot wide. The designation for the instrument holding
   position “INST” is painted on the runway side of the line to be read facing the runway. See
   Figure 4.4.

Figure 4.4. Runway Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Hold Position Markings.




   4.7.2. This marking is used to prevent aircraft and vehicles from interfering with the ILS
   signal transmitted to an aircraft on final approach. IAW AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations
   Procedures and Programs, Paragraph 7.23.2., during inclement weather or when visibility is
   restricted, vehicle operators will not cross the instrument hold line without Control Tower
   approval. In addition to taxiways, portions of the perimeter road and access roads on the
   airfield fall within the ILS signal critical areas that must be protected from vehicle traffic
   when an aircraft is on an ILS approach. When the Control Tower activates the red lights,
   vehicles must stop at marked locations until the light returns to green.
   4.7.3. There are two IFR hold position markings. One is on Taxiway November located
   prior to Point 4 North and the other is located on Taxiway November prior to Point 1 North.
   See Attachment 3.
   4.7.4. Runway IFR Hold Position Stop/Go Wig-Wag lights. These lights are a Wig-Wag
   fixture that flash amber and controlled by the Control Tower. During inclement weather or
   low visibility contact Airfield Management to verify these lines are in effect. See Figure 4.3.
   4.7.5. Runway IFR Hold Position Signs. IFR hold position signs have the word “INST”
   inscribed in white letters on a red background. They are located on the left side of a taxiway,
   adjacent to the IFR runway hold position marking. Stop at these markings when IFR hold
   position lights are on. See Figures 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6.

Figure 4.5. IFR Hold Position Signs and Stop/Go Wig-Wag lights.
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                        19


Figure 4.6. IFR Hold Position Sign.




4.8. Perimeter Road Traffic Lights. In addition to taxiways, portions of the perimeter road
and access roads on the airfield fall within the ILS signal critical areas that must be protected
from vehicle traffic when an aircraft is on an ILS approach. When the Control Tower activates
the red lights, vehicles must stop at marked locations until the light returns to green. See Figure
4.7.

Figure 4.7. Perimeter Road Traffic Lights.




4.9. Taxiway, Taxilane and Apron Markings.
   4.9.1. Taxiway and taxilane (taxi path on an apron) centerlines are marked with a continuous
   yellow line. These centerlines are used to indicate the taxi path of an aircraft.
   4.9.2. Taxiway edges are marked with continuous double yellow lines. This marking
   indicates the edge of the useable taxiway surface from other surfaces not intended for use by
   aircraft.
   4.9.3. Taxilane edges are marked with 15 feet long double yellow lines with 25 feet gaps
   between them and are used to define the limits of a designated taxi route.
   4.9.4. Taxiway and Apron Lights. Taxiway and apron edges are marked with blue lights See
   figure 4.8.

Figure 4.8. Taxiway Edge Lights.




   4.9.5. Taxiway Signs. Taxiway signs are “information signs” that indicate either a current
   location or a direction of travel. Location signs have yellow inscriptions on a black
   background. Directional signs have black inscriptions normally accompanied with a
   directional arrow on yellow backgrounds.
4.10. Closed Pavement Markings. Airfield pavements previously used for aircraft operations
that are closed to aircraft traffic are marked with a yellow X. Some of these areas on the airfield
are degraded. Vehicles may still use these paved areas but will conduct FOD checks prior to
reentering operational airfield pavements.
4.11. Vehicle Lane Markings. Some areas of the airfield have vehicle lanes marked with white
lines. Airfield access roads within the airfield interior and barrier access roads leading to the
runway all have white stop-bar markings. The stopping distances ensure taxiways have required
wing tip clearance. The stop-bars on barrier access roads are in line with CMA hold positions.
4.12. FOD Check Point Signs and Markings. All access roads to the airfield have FOD check
signs and/or markings to remind personnel of mandatory FOD check requirements before
entering the airfield; refer to paragraph 5.10 for FOD check procedures.

   (on-foot) are prohibited from entering the CMA unless in performance of official duties and
   in direct contact with the Control Tower. See Chapter 6 for CMA procedures.
   5.1.6. Vehicles operating in the CMA must use high beams, rotating beams, rotating beacon
   lights and/or emergency flashers.
   5.1.7. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
   mounted in the vehicle. A hand-held radio should be used as a backup or when
   communication is required outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the
   radio used to communicate with the Tower before entering the CMA.
   5.1.8. Do not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when authorizing
   vehicles to enter the CMA for the purpose of an airfield inspection/check or other airfield
   operation.
   5.1.9. Maintain a current local airfield diagram provided by the wing ADPM.
   5.1.10. All vehicles will stop prior to entering the airfield or crossing a taxiway and
   determine visually that the way is clear before proceeding. Aircraft have the right of way at
   all times. Vehicles will never overtake or pass a taxiing aircraft.
   5.1.11. With the exception of a Transient Alert “FOLLOW ME” vehicle, no vehicle will be
   driven into the path of a taxiing aircraft. Never drive a vehicle between a “FOLLOW ME”
   vehicle and an aircraft, a marshaller and an aircraft, or a fire truck and an aircraft when the
   fire truck has its emergency lights on.
   5.1.12. When driving on the airfield, drivers will follow the basic rules of the road. Random
   travel on the airfield is not authorized. Vehicles traveling on taxiways and aprons will not
   drive on the center/taxi lines unless performing official duties. Vehicles will drive along
   taxiway or apron edge and turn 90 degrees to cross.
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                        23


   5.1.13. Vehicles and equipment will not be driven or towed over fuel pit lids located on
   Taxiway Hotel.
   5.1.14. Helicopters operate (hover and ground taxi) on taxiways. It is important that drivers
   look “up” as much as “out” when driving in helicopter operating areas. Drivers must be
   familiar with designated helicopter operating areas on RAF Lakenheath. See figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1. Helicopter Operating Areas.




   5.1.15. Any disabled vehicle on the airfield will be immediately reported to AM. If the
   vehicle is on an apron or taxiway the driver will remain with vehicle and use every means
   possible to alert taxiing aircraft. The driver will establish contact with an applicable control
   center and the owning unit must coordinate vehicle removal.
   5.1.16. Disabled vehicles will never be left unattended in the CMA. In addition to reporting
   the disabled vehicle to AM, vehicle operators will also contact the control tower
   immediately.
   5.1.17. Disabled vehicles are required to turn on parking lights or emergency flashers.
   5.1.18. Government vehicle tow service can be attained by contacting Vehicle Maintenance
   (226-1384) during normal duty hours. The after duty hours tow service contact is Vehicle
   Dispatch (226-4843). 48 SFS is the focal point for POV tow requests, but this service will
   only be provided if the vehicle poses a significant hazard.
   5.1.19. Cellular/mobile phones will not be used while driving on the airfield.
   Cellular/mobile phone usage while on the airfield should only be used as operationally
   necessary.
5.2. Taxiway Sierra Driving Lanes.
   5.2.1. Vehicle operators encountering taxiing aircraft operations will move to the far left
   hand side of the driving lane (or taxiway) and stop. On portions of the taxiway where you are
   not able to meet the 25 feet lateral clearance from the aircraft wingtip without exiting the
 24                                    LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014


   paved surface, ensure the minimum 10 foot wingtip clearance is maintained. Vehicle
   operators will hold their position until the aircraft is over 200 feet beyond their vehicle. Note:
   Vehicles must also yield to towing aircraft operations; operators will hold their position until
   the aircraft is over 50 feet beyond their vehicle. If following an aircraft being towed,
   maintain a distance of at least 50 feet.
   5.2.2. After moving to the left-hand edge of the driving lane, if the vehicle operator
   determines that the aircraft wingspan requires more clearance, drive onto the grass if no other
   paved surface is available.
   5.2.3. Upon returning to the paved surface, vehicle operators will stop and check the tires of
   the vehicle for FOD.
5.3. Airfield Authorized Vehicles.

       normal speed limits.
       5.5.7.6. Vehicles on the runway conducting mission essential functions.
5.6. Vehicle Lighting.
   5.6.1. All vehicles on the airfield will use headlights during the hours of darkness or reduced
   visibility. To preserve an aircrew’s night vision, vehicle headlights will never be shone
   towards a taxiing aircraft. When a taxiing aircraft is encountered, the vehicle will stop and
   headlights will be turned off. Parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on.
 26                                   LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014


   Headlights will remain off until the aircraft has cleared, then turned back on before the
   vehicle is put in motion.
   5.6.2. Golf-cart type vehicles not equipped with parking lights must be positioned to prevent
   headlights from being directed toward taxiing aircraft.
   5.6.3. Drivers of vehicles equipped with daytime running lights must be aware of the
   system’s operating procedure. Normally, to turn the headlights off, a vehicle must stop, shift
   transmission into park, and apply the parking brake to turn the lights off while other
   parking/emergency flashers lights function normally. If this procedure does not work,
   vehicles must be stopped in a direction that does not direct headlights towards a taxiing
   aircraft.
   5.6.4. All vehicles that operate daily within the CMA must use rotating beacon lights,
   regardless of the time of day. Vehicles that do not routinely operate within the CMA, and do
   not have beacon lights must use hazard lights while within the CMA. IAW TO 36-1-191,
   Technical and Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance the following are
   authorized beacon colors:
       5.6.4.1. Amber/Yellow: Sweeper and snowplows.

       safety, AM, mobile command post).
       5.6.4.3. Blue: Security forces, emergency arresting barrier vehicles.
5.7. Reduced Visibility.
   5.7.1. Avoid airfield driving in inclement weather or reduced visibility, unless absolutely
   essential.
   5.7.2. During inclement weather or reduced visibility, CMA vehicle access may be
   suspended, except for emergency response vehicles, at the discretion of AM or Control
   Tower IAW AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, paragraph
   26.2.13.
   5.7.3. When visibility is 300 feet or less, refueling and explosive laden vehicles will not be
   operated without authorization from the 48 Fighter Wing Commander (48 FW/CC). The
   airfield speed limit will be 10 MPH.
   5.7.4. When visibility is 100 feet or less, airfield speed limit will be 5 mph and no vehicles
   except emergency/alert vehicles will be operated on the airfield.
   5.7.5. When visibility is less than 50 feet, emergency response vehicles and alert vehicles
   operated on the airfield will be led by a walking guide equipped with a luminescent or
   flashing wand signaling movement to the vehicle.
   5.7.6. AM will relay reduced visibility driving restrictions to units listed in the base weather
   support plan and over the Ramp Net. Unit control centers must ensure that all their drivers
   are aware of the restrictions when in place.
5.8. Operating in the Vicinity of Aircraft.
   5.8.1. No vehicle or equipment will be driven within 25 feet of an aircraft (when not running
   engines) unless it is mission essential.
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                        27


   5.8.2. Vehicles must not operate within 200 feet behind a fighter-type aircraft with its
   engines running at idle speed, unless engaged in approved servicing/loading as directed by
   technical data. This is increased to 300 feet if the aircraft is taxiing.
   5.8.3. Vehicles must not operate within 400 feet behind a large frame aircraft with its
   engines running at idle speed, unless engaged in approved servicing/loading as directed by
   technical data. This is increased to 500 feet if the aircraft is taxiing.
   5.8.4. All vehicles approaching or operating within 25 feet of an aircraft will approach with
   the driver’s side of the vehicle closest to the aircraft. The only exception are special purpose
   vehicles or cargo loading equipment that require a different approach and maintenance
   vehicles removing AGE from an aircraft.
   5.8.5. No vehicle will be driven within 25 feet (circle of safety) of a parked aircraft, except
   when the aircraft is being serviced, loaded, or off-loaded as prescribed in an applicable
   directive. When operating within the circle of safety, a safety observer must be used and pre-
   positioned checks placed between the aircraft and approaching vehicles to prevent vehicles
   from striking the aircraft.
   5.8.6. Under no circumstance will vehicles be driven into the path of a taxiing/towed
   aircraft, nor around or between a "FOLLOW ME" vehicle escorting a taxiing/towed aircraft.
   5.8.7. No vehicle will be driven beneath any portion of an aircraft unless prescribed in an
   applicable directive.
5.9. Vehicle Parking.
   5.9.1. Vehicles will not be parked within the CMA, ILS critical area or on a taxiway. All

   criteria and be directly supporting aircraft operations. Vehicles must be removed from the
   airfield when not required.
   5.9.2. Vehicle operators must not be involved in any duties that may distract their attention
   away from monitoring their vehicle.
   5.9.3. When the driver’s seat is vacated, the ignition will be turned off, key left in the
   ignition, parking brake applied, and automatic gear shift placed in “Park”, manual in
   “Reverse”. If the vehicle is a standard diesel, it will be left in neutral and chocked.
   5.9.4. Vehicles will not be left unattended with the engine running, except aircraft servicing
   support vehicles that require vehicle engine to operate as power source for auxiliary
   components.
   5.9.5. When the driver’s seat is not occupied of aircraft servicing support vehicles; the
   parking brake will be set and rear wheels chocked.
   5.9.6. AGE towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the driver
   completes hookup operations. This facilitates movement of the vehicle by hand to align
   pintle and tongue. Extreme care must be taken on sloping surfaces. The vehicle must be
   shut off with parking brake applied if not required to move off with the AGE equipment
   immediately following hookup.
   5.9.7. Vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral braking system will have
   one rear wheel chocked, both front and back of the tire, while parked on an apron. Backing-

   up near a parked aircraft is prohibited; ensure vehicles are staged so this procedure can be
   avoided when departing the vicinity of an aircraft.
   5.9.8. Vehicles will be parked with the driver’s side towards the aircraft and never towards
   an aircraft. Vehicles parked at the sides of an aircraft must be parked clear of the wingtips
   and clearly visible from the cockpit.
   5.9.9. Vehicles shall not park within 25 feet of an aircraft, except as authorized for
   operations such as loading or unloading, servicing or towing.
   5.9.10. Vehicles shall not be parked within 25 feet in front of, or within 200 feet (fighter
   type aircraft) or 400 feet (large frame aircraft) behind an aircraft whose engines are being
   started or are running.
   5.9.11. Vehicle operators must remain in close proximity (within 25 feet) of the vehicle if
   temporarily parked in aircraft movement areas. Note: Security Forces responding to alarm
   activations can exceed the 25 feet distance, but must move their vehicles from aircraft
   movement areas as soon as alarm assessments are completed.
   5.9.12. Aircraft support vehicles, including fuel trucks, follow-me vehicles, etc., must be
   chocked at all times when parked in any aircraft movement area.
   5.9.13. Emergency response vehicles are exempt from these requirements while performing
   official duties, due to the operational necessity.
5.10. Airfield Obstructions.
   5.10.1. Vehicles, AGE, Materials Handling Equipment (MHE), etc., are all categorized as
   mobile obstructions. Vehicles will not be parked nor equipment left unattended or stored in
   aircraft movement areas such as taxiways, ramps, aprons, or parking areas that violates
   aircraft clearance requirements.
   5.10.2. Equipment required to support aircraft conducting local flying or transient aircraft
   operations may be staged on an aircraft parking spot(s) no earlier than two hours prior to
   departure/arrival and must be removed when no longer required. IAW United States Air
   Forces in Europe Instruction (USAFEI) 32-1007, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design,
   when such equipment is not in use, it must be removed from the aircraft parking areas and
   stored.
   5.10.3. Vehicles and equipment not directly supporting aircraft operations must be parked in
   areas that provide obstruction clearance requirements or removal from the airfield.
   Equipment, when not in use, will be stored in the approved AGE sub-pools identified on the
   Master Aircraft Parking Plan, TAB-E9, or in the non-aircraft movement areas or at a distance
   no less than 50 feet from the parking apron edge to ensure the safety of the aircraft and
   aircrew.
   5.10.4. USAFEI 32-1007, gives the lateral clearance distance criteria for aircraft movement
   areas to fixed or mobile obstacles:
   5.10.5. Fixed wing taxiways require 164 feet (50 meters) measured from the centerline of the
   taxiway.
   5.10.6. Rotary wing taxiways require 100 feet (30.48 meters) from the taxiway centerline.
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                        29


   5.10.7. Aircraft parking aprons used to park large-frame aircraft require 115 feet (35 meter)
   measured from the edge of the pavement or the apron boundary marking.

   clearance along the length of the access apron. Wingtip clearance at entrance to PASs may
   be reduced to 5 feet (1.52 meter).
   5.10.9. Taxitracks in restricted areas (including the green section) used solely by fighter
   aircraft require 49.2 feet (15 meter) measured from the centerline.
   5.10.10. Towways for F-15s require a horizontal and vertical clearance from the towway
   centerline to fixed or mobile obstacles. The horizontal clearance is 46.4 feet (14.1 meter).
   The vertical clearance is 29.2 feet (8.9 meters). Note: These distances are subject to change
   IAW USAFEI 32-1007.
   5.10.11. Deviations to the directives must be coordinated with the AFM and 48 FW/SE at
   least 72 hours prior to placement by the unit.
5.11. FOD Prevention and Control.
   5.11.1. All personnel using the airfield will comply with and enforce wing FOD policy.
   5.11.2. Vehicle Control Officer/Non-Commissioned Officer VCO/VCNCO will ensure all
   GOVs have a FOD pick and FOD receptacle in their vehicles IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
   Equipment Maintenance Management.
   5.11.3. All vehicles entering the airfield or crossing an airfield surface must stop and
   perform a rollover FOD check. Checks will include tires, wheel wells, fenders and truck
   beds. Each individual item being towed must also be checked thoroughly. Operators towing
   FOD magnets must also remove any debris from the collection face. During inclement
   weather, FOD checks will include removal of any snow and ice build ups from vehicle tops,
   bumpers, and wheel wells. FOD checks during the hours of darkness must be performed
   with a flashlight.
   5.11.4. A “Rollover FOD” check is defined as stopping the vehicle performing a check of
   tires, wheel wells, fenders and truck bed, then moving the vehicle forward a sufficient
   distance to ensure that the tire has rotated through half of its circumference. The vehicle will
   then be stopped and the tires checked again. Debris found in the tire surface or tread will be
   removed.
   5.11.5. FOD check exempt crossing points (See attachment 5) are:
      5.11.5.1. The industrial area when accessed by crossing Taxiway Sierra through the

Note: Operators will still perform a visual FOD check of the areas while driving. When FOD is
observed, stop and remove the FOD from the pavement surface if it is safe to do so.
   5.11.6. Vehicles will be operated on hard surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If
   operation on an unpaved surface is absolutely necessary, vehicle operators will perform a
   FOD check immediately after returning to a paved surface. If the pavement requires cleaning
   after returning to the paved surface (e.g. mud deposits fall from vehicle or tires) the vehicle
   operator will ensure a sweeper is requested through AM at the earliest opportunity. Vehicle
   operators should stay out of areas marked with hashed yellow or white lines; these are high
   FOD hazard areas.
   5.11.7. Vehicle operators encountering small amounts of FOD will stop and secure the FOD.
   Large amounts of debris will immediately be reported to AM, who will dispatch a sweeper.
   Provide a description and the exact location of the debris. For large amounts, remain at the
   location until an AM representative arrives to cone off the affected area, or a sweeper arrives.
   5.11.8. Headgear will not be worn on the airfield within aircraft hazard areas. If headgear is
   carried on the airfield it must be properly secured. Exceptions: Hardhats may be worn
   during airfield construction operations.
   5.11.9. Ensure pintle hook pins are properly installed and attached to the vehicle with a
   lanyard.
   5.11.10. Bring all suspected aircraft associated FOD to AM at building 1392. FOD such as

   Maintenance, Crash Recovery, Security Forces and Mobile Command Post. All other
   support vehicles are considered secondary response agencies.
   5.12.2. All emergency response vehicles responding to an emergency on or near the runway
   will standby at points 1, 2, 3, and/or 4 (see Attachment 3) and await Tower approval for
   runway access. Tower will authorize access to the runway from specific points for specific
   response agencies. Note: Secondary emergency vehicles will remain 200 feet behind the
   CMA hold lines and will not be permitted access to the runway unless Tower provides
   permission.
   5.12.3. During an emergency situation, either actual or simulated, vehicles/equipment will
   not be driven or parked in front of emergency response vehicles. All vehicles will remain at
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                    31


   least 100 feet to the rear of all emergency response vehicles, or when parking upwind of any
   emergency location.
   5.12.4. Permission to enter an emergency cordon site will be approved by the on-scene
   commander or senior fire chief.
   5.12.5. Emergency response vehicle operators will maintain situational awareness for
   taxiing/towed aircraft and will not obstruct aircraft movements unless warranted by the
   emergency.
5.13. Use of Vehicle Tire Chains. The use of tire chains must be approved by the AFM, 48
FW/SE and 48 CES.
5.14. Airfield Driving with Night Vision Devices (NVD). Driving on RAF Lakenheath
airfield is not permitted while using NVD. If units need to use NVD on the airfield they must
have an approved Local Operating Procedure (LOP) coordinated with AM, 48th Operations
Support Squadron Airfield Operations Flight (48 OSS/OSA), and approved by the 48 OSS
Commander (48 OSS/CC). AM will ensure the lesson plan meets AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving
and AFMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operator guidance. See also
LAKENHEATHI 13-201, Airfield Operations Procedures.
5.15. Driving during Exercises.
   5.15.1. Exercises are not justification for violating established procedures within this
   instruction.
   5.15.2. Normal day-to-day procedures will apply; emergency response vehicles have right-
   of-way.
5.16. Airfield Evacuation.
   5.16.1. When notified by a recognized authority, all vehicle operators and personnel will
   immediately evacuate the designated area, or the airfield.
   5.16.2. Should a vehicle operator or personnel become aware of any situation requiring an
   airfield evacuation they must immediately notify AM.
5.17. Smoking Areas. Smoking is prohibited on the airfield except in approved unit areas.
5.18. Jet Blast.
   5.18.1. Exhaust blast of jet engines can be hazardous to equipment and particularly

                                         Chapter 6

         CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREAS AND RADIO PROCEDURES

6.1. CMA.
  6.1.1. The CMA is defined as any portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and
  pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control approval for access. Runway, runway
  shoulders and overruns, all areas within 150 feet of the aforementioned items, and any area
  on the runway side of the instrument hold lines when the instrument vehicle control lights are
  illuminated red, are considered the CMA.
  6.1.2. Access to the CMA is limited to mission essential operations only.
  6.1.3. Operators requesting permission to enter the CMA will stop their vehicle
  approximately 30 feet prior to the VFR hold line (if vehicle control lights are illuminated
  green) or approximately 30 feet prior to the IFR hold line (if vehicle control lights are
  illuminated red). Access roads to barrier shacks have a stop bar indicating the CMA edge.
  Vehicles must stop at these points and request Control Tower approval before proceeding.
  Vehicles shall not proceed until Control Tower gives approval to enter the CMA. Vehicles or
  personnel working on the infield areas of the airfield will use the barrier shacks as a visual
  reference to determine the edge of the CMA. Note: Stopping 30 feet from the hold line
  allows a vehicle room to exit the area (without reversing) should an aircraft approach. Do
  not cross the hold lines while attempting to turn around.
  6.1.4. In certain circumstances, the Control Tower may grant access to the CMA but limit
  the areas that maybe accessed. For example, grass mowing equipment may be granted access
  to the CMA and told they are approved up to, but not on, the runway. Barrier Maintenance
  personnel may be approved in to the barrier shacks but told to hold short of the runway. In
  these situations, it is imperative that the drivers fully understand and acknowledge Control
  Tower’s instructions.
  6.1.5. Any time the Control Tower directs vehicles or personnel to exit the CMA, they will
  depart the CMA by the most direct route to a position outside of the CMA boundary.
  6.1.6. The Control Tower will advise AM of any vehicles observed operating in the CMA
  without their approval, or failure to comply with tower instructions. Failure to comply with
  Control Tower instructions will result in immediate withdrawal of all airfield driving
  privileges until AM completes a review of the violation. The results of a review will be
  forwarded to the violator’s unit commander, unit ADPM and 48 FW/SE.
  6.1.7. If vehicle operators are unsuccessful in contacting Control Tower for access into the
  CMA due to airfield closure, contact Eagle Operations, 48 FW Command Post (48 FW/CP)
  via Ramp Net for CMA access (see LAKENHEATHI 13-201, Airfield Operations
  Procedures).
     6.1.7.1. When TWR closes, TWR will broadcast on the RAMP and CRASH NETS:
     “ATTENTION ON THE NET, LAKENHEATH TOWER IS NOW CLOSED.” 6.1.7.2.
     All vehicles shall contact 48 FW/CP (call sign “EAGLE OPS”) when accessing and
     leaving the CMA.
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                       33


      6.1.7.2. All vehicles shall contact 48 FW/CP (call sign “EAGLE OPS”) when accessing
      and leaving the CMA.
      6.1.7.3. 48 FW/CP will monitor the RAMP and CRASH NETS and verify the airfield
      status for each vehicle, stating “(CALL SIGN), EAGLE OPS, AIRFIELD CLOSED,
      PROCEED AT YOUR DISCRETION, USE CAUTION, REPORT OFF.”
      6.1.7.4. When TWR opens, TWR will broadcast on the RAMP and CRASH NETS:
      “ATTENTION ON THE NET, LAKENHEATH TOWER IS NOW OPEN AND HAS
      CONTROL OF THE RUNWAY. ALL VEHICLES RESPOND WITH CALL SIGN
      AND POSITION IN THE CMA.”
   6.1.8. Taxiways (except for areas within the CMA) and parking aprons are not part of the
   CMA. Radio contact with the Control Tower is not required in these areas.
6.2. Convoy or Escort Procedures.
   6.2.1. Personnel acting as escorts must be authorized and certified to drive on the airfield
   and be fully aware of associated responsibilities. Escorts must brief all drivers on route,
   speed, and procedures.
   6.2.2. The number of vehicles in a convoy must be limited to the minimum required to
   accomplish the mission. The convoy must maintain close intervals when crossing the CMA.
   The convoy escort must be in the lead vehicle and is responsible for all communications with
   the Control Tower.
   6.2.3. The lead vehicle will contact the Control Tower and advise of how many vehicles are
   in the convoy; i.e., “…Airfield 3 convoy plus three…” means a total of four vehicles. The
   lead vehicle will not enter the CMA until the Control Tower approves and will not call off
   the CMA until the last vehicle has crossed the CMA boundary.
6.3. Radio Procedures.
   6.3.1. Personnel will contact the Control Tower via the base land mobile radio Ramp Net,
   call sign “Lakenheath Ground.” Personnel shall continuously monitor the Ramp Net the
   entire time they remain within the CMA. Note: All airfield call signs are available on
   Attachment 6.
   6.3.2. If radio contact is lost, the Control Tower will flash runway lights on and off, or use
   light gun signals to direct the vehicle to exit the CMA. If a vehicle has a radio failure, they
   will depart the CMA right away and then contact the Control Tower and Airfield
   Management immediately to report they are out of the CMA and to report the incident.
   6.3.3. Vehicles will only use approved call signs as described in Attachment 6. AM may
   approve temporary call signs in coordination with the Control Tower on a case-by-case basis.
   6.3.4. For runway access, delay radio communications with the tower until a thorough visual
   check for aircraft and other vehicles has been accomplished. After obtaining tower’s
   permission, proceed as directed and advise tower when departing the CMA. Note: Control
   Tower approval to enter the CMA does not guarantee that aircraft/vehicle conflicts will be
   avoided. Vehicle operators must be vigilant and maintain situational awareness of the
   environment.
   6.3.5. Non-essential radio communications are kept to an absolute minimum.
 34                                  LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014


6.4. Radio Phraseology.
   6.4.1. To eliminate miscommunication and possibly compromising safety, it is imperative
   that proper phraseology be adhered to. Radio transmissions are monitored (and recorded) by
   AM and the Control Tower at all times. Violating radio phraseology requirements can result
   in loss of driving privileges.
   6.4.2. All radio communications will be kept to the minimum required to accomplish the
   mission and IAW paragraph 6.4.6. Use the International Civil Aviation Organization
   (ICAO) pronunciation for individual letters and/or numbers included in the radio
   transmissions IAW Attachment 7.
   6.4.3. The words “CLEAR”, “CLEARED”, CLEARING or “CLEARANCE” will never be
   used by vehicles or personnel. These words are reserved for communication between
   Control Tower and aircraft only. You are authorized to use “LOUD and CLEAR” when
   conducting a radio check”.
   6.4.4. The only word that authorizes access to the CMA is “PROCEED.” “ON” is the proper
   term for entering the CMA. “OFF” is the proper term for exiting the CMA. “HOLD
   SHORT” means disapproval of a request and do not enter the CMA. “CROSS” or
   “ACROSS” only authorizes a vehicle to cross the CMA. If approved to cross, do not stop
   within the CMA without Control Tower permission.
   6.4.5. It is mandatory that all “HOLD SHORT” or “PROCEED” instructions issued by the
   Control Tower are acknowledged by reading back the instruction verbatim. A vehicle will
   not enter the CMA until instructions issued by the Control Tower are read back. Vehicle
   operators must listen carefully and repeat Control Tower instructions as they understand
   them. Note: If there is uncertainty or confusion about tower’s instructions, request tower to
   repeat the instructions, or explain clearly. If additional instructions are unclear, exit the
   CMA immediately and advise tower when out of the CMA.
   6.4.6. Always ensure radios are keyed prior to beginning the transmission to prevent parts of
   the communications being cut off. Also ensure that the radio mike does not have wind
   blowing into or across it while transmitting.
   6.4.7. Normal communication sequence:
      6.4.7.1. Callsign of station being called (who you are calling).
      6.4.7.2. Your call sign (who you are).
      6.4.7.3. Your location (where you are).
      6.4.7.4. Your request (what you want to do).
      6.4.7.5. Sample communication sequence:
          6.4.7.5.1. Airfield 3: “Lakenheath Ground, Airfield 3.”
          6.4.7.5.2. Lakenheath Ground: Airfield 3, Lakenheath Ground.”
          6.4.7.5.3. Airfield 3: “Lakenheath Ground, Airfield 3 at point 3 south, request
          permission to cross the runway to point 3 north.”
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                        35


      6.4.7.5.4. Lakenheath Ground: “Airfield 3, Lakenheath Ground. Proceed across runway
      24 from point-3 south to point 3 north. Report when off.”
          6.4.7.5.5. Airfield 3: “Lakenheath Ground, Airfield 3 proceeding across runway 24
          from point 3 south to point 3 north, will report when off.”
          6.4.7.5.6. Airfield 3: “Lakenheath Ground, Airfield 3 is off the runway at point-3
          north.”
          6.4.7.5.7. Lakenheath Ground: “Airfield 3, Lakenheath Ground copies. Remain off
          the runway.”
6.5. Control Tower Light Gun Signals.
   6.5.1. Control Tower may use light gun signals (see AFVA 11-240, Airport Signs and
   Markings and AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Procedures) to
   instruct vehicle operations if they do not receive a response to their radio transmissions or in
   the event radio contact is lost. All airfield drivers must be familiar with light gun signals.
   6.5.2. Light gun signals are:
      6.5.2.1. Steady green - clear to cross.
      6.5.2.2. Steady red - stop. (Vehicle will not be moved.)
      6.5.2.3. Flashing red - clear active runway immediately
      6.5.2.4. Flashing white - return to starting point.
      6.5.2.5. Alternating red and green light - general warning, exercise extreme caution.

   entering the CMA without specific control tower approval. This definition also includes
   runway incursions.
   7.2.2. Runway Incursion is a CMAV event that involves the incorrect presence of an aircraft,
   vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of
   aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
   7.2.3. For a CMAV and Runway Incursion, the individual’s AF Form 483 must be
   surrendered to AM and airfield driving privileges must be revoked until an investigation and
   retraining/certification are complete.
   7.2.4. Runway Incursions and CMAV events must be reported to 48 FW/SE as outlined in
   AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, Chapter 6.
   7.2.5. The AOF/CC, 48 FW/SE, and wing ADPM will work together to assign all runway
   incursions an operational category.
   7.2.5.1. Operational Error (OE)- a failure of the air traffic control system that results in the
   loss of separation.
      7.2.5.2. Pilot Deviation (PD) – the action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC
      instruction, AFI’s and/or FARs.
      7.2.5.3. Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD) – any entry or movement on the controlled
      movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that
      has not been authorized by air traffic control (ATC).
   7.2.6. The AFM or designated representatives are responsible for taking immediate actions
   to correct the problem or applying interim control measures.
   7.2.7. Runway Incursions and CMAVs must be briefed at the AOB.
   7.2.8. The wing ADPM will provide a detailed description of each incident to include (What,
   When, Where and How, type vehicle/aircraft involved and action taken to prevent a
   reoccurrence).
LAKENHEATH INSTRUCTION 13-202 8 MAY 2014                                                          37


   7.2.9. The wing ADPM will highlight any trends.

   RDS, Table 13-06, Rule 15.00. (See AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
   Program and AFI 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports)
   7.2.11. The wing ADPM and 48 FW/SE will conduct an investigation of all CMAVs. If the
   driver is found to be at fault, airfield driving privileges will be revoked. The unit commander
   along with the individual will be notified by the wing ADPM in writing or electronic
   notification within 24 hours. The driver must be completely retrained per this instruction and
   obtain a new AF Form 483 before driving privileges are reinstated.
   7.2.12. For runway incursions, the wing ADPM must inspect the unit ADPM as part of the
   investigation. Emphasis will be placed on how the unit trained the individual and their
   compliance with the ADI. Final results will be reported to the unit commander.
   7.2.13. Any individual whose base driving privileges have been revoked will also have all
   airfield driving privileges revoked automatically for the period of the suspension.
   Individuals will have to re-accomplish all airfield training prior to resumption of airfield
   driving privileges. Unit commanders or unit ADPMs must notify the wing ADPM when
   base driving privileges have been revoked.

                       INDUSTRIAL AREA/AGE GATE CROSSING

8.1. General. This chapter covers specifics regarding the crossing point on Taxiway Sierra at
RAF Lakenheath and applies to all personnel regardless of possession of AF Form 483.
8.2. Crossing Location and Use.
   8.2.1. The industrial AGE gate crossing is located next to Hangar 6 and is the only
   authorized crossing point for POVs in the industrial area.
   8.2.2. POVs must cross in a straight line (do not turn left or right) to enter/exit the industrial
   area. Note: Vehicles issued a POV pass may turn left or right to enter the restricted area at
   the ECP. See Attachment 5.
   8.2.3. Personnel do not require AF Form 483 or RAF Lakenheath POV Pass to cross taxiway
   Sierra at this point.
   8.2.4. . FOD checks are not required at this crossing area.
8.3. Right-of-Way Procedures.
   8.3.1. Vehicles waiting to cross will yield to all other vehicles in the taxiway driving lanes.
   8.3.2. All vehicles waiting to cross will yield to aircraft within the industrial area/AGE gate.
   Note: Aircraft enter/exit the industrial area/AGE gate crossing perimeter at the restricted
   area ECPs (see Attachment 5). These ECPs are 300 feet to the left and right of the industrial
   area/AGE gate crossing.
   8.3.3. Vehicles will not cross if a taxiing aircraft is at the restricted area ECP.
   8.3.4. Vehicles will not cross until a taxiing aircraft has exited the industrial area/AGE gate
   area via the opposing restricted area ECP. This will ensure the minimum 300 feet of required
   distance behind a taxing aircraft. Note: Never drive between a “FOLLOW ME” escort
   vehicle and a taxing aircraft, regardless of the distance between the two.
   8.3.5. Vehicles will not cross in front of a towed aircraft, unless the aircrew/marshaller gives
   a positive signal to proceed. Vehicles may cross after a towed aircraft has passed their
   positions by a minimum of 50 feet.
   8.3.6. Vehicles experiencing mechanical problems will follow the procedures in paragraph
   5.1.14.
