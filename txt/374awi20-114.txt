This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Renumbered to 374 AWI 20-114; updated Philosophy; and updated all the
responsibilites.
 2                                                                374AWI20-114 19 APRIL 2012


1. Philosophy:
     1.1. Corrosion has a direct impact on the readiness of AF systems. It must be prevented,
     identified and repaired as prudently as possible.
     1.2. Corrosion minimization on AF aircraft and ground equipment is the direct responsibility
     of all users and maintainers. Due consideration must be given to corrosion prevention during
     all planning, operation, and maintenance actions.
     1.3. The 374 AW Corrosion program is oriented towards prevention. This is accomplished
     through equipment cleaning, maintenance of protective coatings, and early detection and
     treatment of corrosion. Strict adherence to corrosion prevention policies and technical orders
     is essential.
     1.4. All maintenance and operations personnel, regardless of Air Force Specialty Code
     (AFSC), are responsible to document potentially corroded structures/components in the
     proper maintenance forms. The Aircraft Structural Maintenance (ASM) Section evaluates
     corrosion discrepancies to determine proper treatment or repair.
     1.5. Clean aircraft metal components with only approved cleansers IAW the current
     Qualified Products List (QPL). The current QPL can be obtained from the Wing Corrosion
     Manager.
2. Wing Corrosion Manager Responsibilities:
     2.1. Ensure that only properly trained personnel operate shop corrosion prevention
     equipment.
     2.2. Works with the Fabrication Flight Chief to ensure 2A7X3 technicians receive adequate
     training (formal and on-the-job) to accomplish assigned tasks.
     2.3. Oversees corrosion control maintenance actions at the aircraft wash facility and
     corrosion control hangar, or any other location where corrosion control maintenance actions
     are taking place in support of the 374 AW mission.
     2.4. Reviews the QPL for approved corrosion control materials at least every six months as
     issued by the AF Corrosion Prevention and Control Office (AFCPCO). The most current
     document will be kept in the Wing Corrosion Manager’s continuity book.
3. Wash Rack Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) Responsibilities:
     3.1. Ensures fall protection lifeline cables are installed when required and serviceable.
     3.2. Ensures cleaners and equipment are authorized, procured, available and properly used,
     to include proper mix ratio IAW applicable T.O. or instruction.
     3.3. Ensures wash rack facility and surrounding area are kept clean and properly maintained.
        3.3.1. Ensures the facility and equipment are cleaned and properly stored upon
        completion of each wash and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) control procedures are
        followed IAW paragraph 4 of this instruction.
        3.3.2. Ensures all wash rack equipment is in serviceable condition, and coordinates
        maintenance actions as needed.

   3.4. Ensures Composite Tool Kit (CTK) procedures are followed and scrub pads are
   controlled in the same manner as rags IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
   Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-101_AMCSUP, MAF Aircraft and Equipment
   Maintenance Management.
4. Aircraft Owning Activity Responsibilities:
   4.1. Appoint an Aircraft Wash Supervisor for each wash to monitor progress of the wash and
   ensure safe operations.
   4.2. Coordinate and schedule use of the wash rack facility through the 374th Maintenance
   Operations Squadron Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (374 MOS/MXOOP) for aircraft
   washes.
       4.2.1. In the event a wash schedule change or cancellation is needed, the owning activity
       will inform the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). The COR will ensure the
       contractor, 374 MOS/MXOOP, and the Wash Rack NCOIC are informed of all schedule
       changes and cancellations.
   4.3. Notify the COR upon completion of the wash. The COR will accomplish and document
   a cleanliness inspection on the aircraft prior to release back to the owning activity.
       4.3.1. The isochronal/phase inspection dock supervisor, if trained and delegated as COR,
       may accomplish the cleanliness inspection for isochronal/phase aircraft washes only.
   4.4. Wash Crew Supervisor and an ASM representative will inspect the wash facility CTK
   and wash pad before beginning any aircraft wash. The Wash Crew Supervisor will sign them
   out from the ASM Support Section using TCMaxx or AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue
   Receipt, indicating acceptance of the condition of the wash facility for the duration of the
   wash.
   4.5. The Aircraft Owning Activity will perform a FOD walk before the aircraft is towed on
   to the wash rack and no later than 30 minutes after the aircraft is towed out of the facility.
   4.6. The Wash Crew Supervisor or Aircraft Owning Activity will conduct a FOD inspection
   after removal of the aircraft. After the wash rack has passed their inspection, the Wash Crew
   Supervisor and an ASM representative will perform a joint inventory of the wash rack CTK,
   and sign it back in, before releasing the Wash Crew Supervisor from responsibility of the
   wash rack.
5. Cleaning and Aircraft Wash Documentation:
   5.1. The Aircraft Owning Activity will enter the following entries into the AFTO Form
   781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, as a minimum, prior to an aircraft
   wash:
       5.1.1. “Aircraft wash required” on a red “diagonal.”
       5.1.2. “Aircraft masked and prepped for wash” on a red “X.”
       5.1.3. “Aircraft post-wash cleanliness inspection due” on a red “dash.”
       5.1.4. “Aircraft post-wash lubrication due” on a red “diagonal.”
 4                                                               374AWI20-114 19 APRIL 2012


6. Corrosion Prevention and Control/Aircraft Wash Training: The Wing Corrosion
Manager provides Maintenance Operations Training Flight current training materials for
Corrosion Awareness Training conducted in Block Training.
7. Protective Coating Maintenance:
     7.1. Maintenance painting is defined for field purposes as spot painting, sectionalized
     painting, and complete scuff sand and overcoat. Maintenance painting of aircraft will not be
     accomplished solely for cosmetics because of environmental and overall aircraft weight and
     balance concerns.
     7.2. The 374 MXS ASM Section will determine priority for maintenance painting by scoring
     all aircraft coating systems IAW T.O. 1-1-8, Application and Removal of Organic Coatings,
     Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment, paragraph 8.2.4.
        7.2.1. At a minimum aircraft protective coating will be scored semi-annually or at after
        each aircraft wash whichever is sooner. The Wing Corrosion Manager is responsible for
        retaining a copy of all paint scores until they are superseded, or the equipment is taken
        out of service.
        7.2.2. Complete over coating of AGE/support equipment will be scheduled by AGE and
        Fabrication Flights according to mission requirements and current coating condition.
        Maintenance painting of deteriorated areas will be done to prevent or repair corrosion.
     7.3. Non-critical corrosion control tasking (painting of FOD cans, chocks, signs etc.) will be
     kept to an absolute minimum. In cases where non-critical items are painted the local
     manufacture process will be followed.
8. AGE Corrosion Requirements:
     8.1. AGE Flight will visually assess equipment paint condition and overall unit corrosion, at
     a minimum, during every scheduled periodic inspection. This includes complying with a 180
     day wash cycle (IAW 35-1-3, paragraph 2.1.2., Table 2-1). Also, all AGE will have a
     corrosion control inspection scheduled in the MIS and performed every 2 years. This
     inspection will be completed and signed off in the MIS by a 5-skill level or above Aircraft
     Structural Maintenance (ASM) Specialist on Thursday each week, or as coordinated between
     AGE and ASM monitors. ASM will complete the corrosion checklist and provide it to AGE
     personnel for filing into the equipment historical records and/or for updating the corrosion
     tracker. AGE will attend the monthly scheduling meeting to ensure corrosion control
     painting requirements are identified and scheduled as required.
     8.2. AGE will perform the following preparations before the equipment will be accepted by
     the Corrosion Control Section for refurbishment:
        8.2.1. Non-powered equipment: Remove bumper pads, tie down straps, webbing hoses,
        mobility placards, stickers/stencils, and any other items that would prevent proper
        sanding or painting of equipment.
        8.2.2. Powered equipment: Remove batteries, bleed air hoses, power cables, air
        conditioner and heater ducts, hydraulic test stand hoses, mobility placards,
        stickers/stencils, and any other items that would prevent proper sanding or painting of
        equipment.
