This supplement implements and extends the guidance of AFI 10-206, 4 October 2004 and
AETC Sup 1, 22 December 2003 (Certified Current: 10 October 2006). It applies to wing,
and tenant/associated organizations on or surrounding the installation. It explains the purpose
and instructions for preparing and submitting the report. The supplement applies to Command
Post personnel involved in processing operational reports. Ensure all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the AF Records Disposition
Schedule (AF RDS) located at: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims.


1.3.1. The Randolph Command Center (12 FTW/CP), as the primary agency for the Air Force
Operational Reporting System, (AFOPREPS), prepares and submits operational reports for all
units and tenant organizations on Randolph AFB, TX. Geographically separated units (GSU)
will use the Randolph Command Center if the nearest servicing command post is unable to
accomplish reporting. All command post (CP) controllers are certified in operational reports and
are available to assist 24 hours a day. CP controllers will obtain wing commander’s
authorization and approval prior to transmitting reports to higher headquarters. The 12th Flying
Training Wing Commander or Vice Wing Commander approves release of all wing reports
covered by this supplement.

1.3.3. Coordinate all publications and plans that deal with AFOPREPS with the 12 FTW/CP to
ensure all compliance requirements are established.

3.4. Any incident meeting the criteria for reporting will be relayed to the Randolph Command
Center as soon as possible, ideally within 15 minutes of the incident. Ensure the CP receives
updates on the situation in a timely manner for follow-up reports if needed. Provide information
pertaining to the incident that answers the questions of who, what, when, why, and where.

Include any other pertinent facts or information and refrain from speculation. The following
organizations are identified as basic sources of information and are specifically tasked to provide
the CP with timely, reportable information: 12 FTW/EO, 12 FTW/SE, 12 OG, 12 MDG, 12
MSG, 12 CS, 12 MSS, 12 SFS, 12 FTW/PA, 12 FTW/JA, 12 FTW/MXD, and AFOSI. After
proper coordination and approval, the CP will relay the report to the appropriate higher
headquarters for action or additional up-channel reporting. The 12 FTW/CC or CV is the final
reporting authority.

3.4.3. (AETC-Added) Wing and unit commanders will be trained semiannually. This training
may be conducted as an e-mail presentation. It will be documented on an approved locally
generated form or e-mail read receipt and maintained in an operational reports book for the
duration of the commander’s assignment.
