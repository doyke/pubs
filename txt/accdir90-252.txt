SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include revi-
sion of critical compliance objectives (CCOs) in readiness, mortuary affairs, fitness, food service, finan-
cial management, the alcohol and beverage program, and training to reflect recent guidance changes and
Interim Change 2004-01 to ACCI 90-202, ACC Compliance and Standardization Requirements List
(C&SRL) Program.


1. General.
   1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRLs) are the primary lists used during
   the HQ ACC/IG Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) to access unit compliance with established guid-
   ance governing each particular area of operations. Items defined in this C&SRL are defined by the
   ACC staff and based upon existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF and
   ACC guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF or ACC leadership to assessing and assuring
2                                                                     ACCDIR90-252 30 AUGUST 2005


    unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies
    that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection items and are
    fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs) and the thirteen missions
    areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core and General Compliance
    Items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the UCI, it is the intent of the ACC/IG to
    inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that apply to the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items
    listed do not limit the scope of the inspection. Critical, core and general compliance criteria are
    defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An item where a unit failure to comply with
       established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or signifi-
       cant mission impact. Key mission areas are airman development programs, ability to deploy
       forces and ability to employ forces. CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and is
       important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance
       would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or possible
       litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to successful
       overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
       accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation. GCIs are shown in
       sentence case format.
