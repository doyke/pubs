    leadership of overdue status.

    assigned to their UIC via ART database and cross-referenced with the current Air Force UTC
    Availability. Review UTCs to ensure applicability to the unit‟s resources. If discrepancies
    are found, follow procedures listed in the ACC Supp 10-244 Para. 3.5.6, for Incorrectly
    Postured/Allocated UTCs.
    3.8.4.7. (Added) Unit ART Monitors should compile information from the Unit
    Deployment Manager for ancillary training and profile duty limitations. Also, monitors
    should coordinate with the Unit Training Manager or supervisor to ensure all training is
    completed in accordance with the UTC Mission Capability (MISCAP) Statement or

    coordinate with section/flight chiefs and be apprised of discrepancies and inform them when
    a UTC is reported as “Red.”
    3.8.4.8. (Added) If no discrepancies exist between the printed report and the squadron
    commander‟s assessments, the commander will sign the report. The signed report gives the
    squadron ART POC the authority to save inputs to the ART database.
    3.8.4.9. (Added) Unit POCs will keep the last three signed ART reports in their continuity
    binder or reference to their classified storage location.
    3.8.4.10. (Added) Any time changes or updates are made, a new report will be generated
    and reviewed by the commander.
