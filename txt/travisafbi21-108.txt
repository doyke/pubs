SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. It has been
restructured and rewritten to include: both the general procedures for any aircraft and specific
instructions for assigned and tenant aircraft. It now integrates E-6B TACAMO, KC-10A, and C-
17A CLS contractor concepts of operations into wing CDDAR support. Detailed attachments
have been added to identify the sources of common and aircraft-specific equipment to ease
annual reviews and consolidate the various tech data requirements of all four assigned air frames.
These attachments will also ease implementation by serving as a pre-coordinated „shopping list‟
of available materials and equipment items needed in crash recovery. This rewrite expands the
role of the Maintenance Operations Center and further defines support required by outside
agencies and leadership. New tenant unit procedures spell out joint operations relationships and
exercise coordination. This OI has also been updated to reflect new AF Emergency Management
terminology and organizational structures. Some common scenarios are added. In addition,
training and safety requirements now reflect the new carbon epoxy materials encountered in C-
17 aircraft.

1. Background/Urgency of Aircraft Removal.
   1.1. A primary objective of the CDDAR program is to return the mishap runway(s) to
   operational status as soon as practical after a mishap. The Wing Commander will determine
   the degree of emergency and make a decision regarding the urgency with which the runway
   is cleared. This decision is dictated by evaluation of alert status, number of airborne or
   returning aircraft, available weather alternates, and other operational criteria.
   1.2. The Wing Commander or designated representative determines and notifies the
   Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Director of removal conditions designated as:
      1.2.1. Emergency. This condition requires immediate runway clearance at the risk of
      losing personnel, equipment, and evidence. Although rescue may be attempted, the
      runway must be cleared in 30 minutes or less.
      1.2.2. Urgent. This condition requires runway clearance as soon as possible after
      completion of rescue, firefighting, and explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) operations.
      The runway will be cleared in less than 1 hour and 30 minutes, unless EOD consideration
      dictates otherwise, using techniques identified in applicable technical publications.
      1.2.3. Routine. This condition allows sufficient time to use recovery techniques to
      minimize further damage to aircraft preserve evidence and precludes exposing personnel
      or equipment to danger.
   1.3. During routine and urgent situations the Incident Commander (IC) is the final authority
   for determining when the mishap site is safe, and when the investigating authority and/or
   CDDAR team may approach the mishap site and/or conduct recovery operations.
   1.4. Due to time constraints of "Emergency" or "Urgent" conditions, it may not be possible
   to use normal procedures. In this case, the IC will decide, in collaboration with the EOC and
   the CDDAR Team Chief, which removal methods are best and which first responder actions
   may or may not proceed.
   1.5. Travis AFB has two active runways. If an aircraft crash-lands in the checkerboard area
   between the two, it may be necessary to clear the aircraft/wreckage as soon as possible to
   facilitate reactivation of at least one of the runways. If necessary, this action will be directed
   by Wing Commander in the Crisis Action Team (CAT).
2. Typical Sequence of Events.
   2.1. Immediately after the incident, first responders operations proceed in accordance with
   CEMP 10-2 Annex A or local civilian response plans. This initiates the Response Phase of
   the plan.
 4                                                 TRAVISAFBI21-108 17 DECEMBER 2012


     2.2. The IC ensures initial rescue, firefighting, security and safeying of the aircraft is
     performed. No one other than first responders can enter the mishap area. The mishap scene
     must be determined safe by the IC prior to any investigation or CDDAR actions.
     2.3. The incident aircraft and its equipment must not be disturbed or removed unless directed
     or released by the IC, ISB President/SIB President or Impoundment Official/MXG
     Representative. Control of the mishap scene remains with the IC until access control is
     granted to the Board President, Vice President or Impound Official/MXG Representative
     appointed by the Investigating Authority.
     2.4. Under Emergency or Urgent removal conditions, the recovery/investigation phase may
     be postponed or waived by the Wing Commander.
     2.5. While the initial response is in progress the CDDAR Team Chief along with the team
     members should plan and posture the equipment and materials required to recover the
     aircraft. If possible, one team member should use binoculars to monitor the mishap site from
     a safe distance approved by the IC.
     2.6. When first-responder actions are complete, the Response Phase will end and the
     Recovery Phase, which includes investigation actions, will begin. The IC will then transfer
     access control of the mishap site over to the appointed Recovery Operations Chief (ROC).
     The ROC is normally an aircraft MX Officer or SNCO appointed by the EOC Director in
     consultation with the MXG/CC. The ROC will coordinate both the efforts of the
     Investigating Authority officials and the CDDAR Team Chief.
     2.7. Emergency or Urgent removal conditions may bypass the deliberate
     recovery/investigation phase and dictate expedient ad-hoc planning and execution of
     CDDAR duties.
     2.8. Under routine removal conditions, the Investigation Authority advises the ROC that
     control of the aircraft can be given to the CDDAR Team Chief or salvage teams to restore,
     reclaim or dispose of the aircraft when the investigation is complete.
     2.9. During the beginning of the Recovery Phase and/or investigation, the EOC may
     continue to provide support to the ROC as needed, directed by the EOC Director. The EOC
     director and MXG/CC will collaborate and determine when the recovery efforts become
     routine support actions. At this point, the EOC and ROC will stand down and mishap
     support will be transferred to the designated MXG function.

9. Safety Precautions and Considerations Prior To Aircraft Movement. WARNING:
Ensure that it is safe to approach the aircraft, all explosives, ejection seat cartridges, tires, fluids,
flares, and munitions are de-armed, expended, or otherwise proclaimed safe by the fire
department and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). EOD must be notified for further
evaluation before an aircraft can be moved.
WARNING: Make sure the aircraft remains stable at all times and that personnel use extreme
caution when working in and around a disabled aircraft. Before any ground handling activities
take place on or around the aircraft, CDDAR personnel will ensure that it is properly stabilized
to prevent movement or shifting. It may be necessary to moor the aircraft or stabilize it using air
bags.
WARNING: Due to the many unknown factors of airframe condition immediately following a
crash landing, do not attempt to use special equipment or procedures not included in the specific
aircraft technical orders, or without approval of the specific airframe system manager/engineer.
TRAVISAFBI21-108 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                              17

the specific aircraft.
   9.1. Damaged incident aircraft, or any parts, will not be moved until authorized and directed
   by the ISB/SIB President or the wing Flight Safety Officer. Any movement of the aircraft
   from the site will be under the direct supervision of the aircraft mishap investigation board
   member.
   9.2. Safe and lighten the aircraft to the maximum extent possible by:
       9.2.1. Grounding the aircraft.
       9.2.2. Removing the aircraft batteries.
       9.2.3. Completely defueling and purging the tank areas.
       9.2.4. Contain and clean up any clean fuel or hydraulic oil leakage.
       9.2.5. Removing all oxygen containers from the aircraft and bleed any oxygen from
       associated lines.
       9.2.6. Downloading unnecessary equipment and cargo.
10. Off-base Crash Recovery Considerations.
   10.1. In coordination with the civilian IC, the CDDAR Team Chief and CLS contractor
   initial response team will visit the site to review the situation to determine equipment
   requirements prior to dispatching the entire team.
   10.2. Under no circumstances will personnel or equipment be dispatched off-base, if it
   jeopardizes the mission of on-base recovery operations, unless directed by the 60 AMW/CC
   or designated representative.
11. Equipment Requirements/Details.
   11.1. The equipment listed in the attachments is essential for CDDAR operations and are
   based on requirements in applicable tech data manuals.
       11.1.1. The listed equipment will not be moved to an off-base location without specific
       approval of the 60 AMW/CC or higher designated representative.
       11.1.2. Aero Repair Section will notify 60 AMXS Support Flight if 60 MXS Aero Repair
       Section‟s 15-ton crane is inoperative. In such cases, 60 AMXS‟ 15-ton crane will be
       utilized as a back-up for crash recovery. Crash recovery will check the status of the 60
       AMXS 15-ton crane daily while Aero Repair Section‟s 15-ton crane is inoperative.
       60/349 CES will provide additional crane support, if required.
