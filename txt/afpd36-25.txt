SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change eliminates the requirement to collect and display notional promotion opportunity
and phase point metrics by grade previously outlined in Attachment 2. Changes also include
updated guidance/references concerning the similarities and differences inherent in managing the
particular officer promotion management programs for the Air Force’s three Total Force
components – RegAF, AFR, and ANG.
1. Overview. The Air Force must be able to identify Airmen with the highest potential to fill
positions of increased grade and responsibility. This directive establishes policies for promoting
and demoting Airmen to grades appropriate to their abilities and for meeting Air Force needs.
2. Policy. The Air Force promotion system will provide a visible, relatively stable career
progression, consistent with the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980, Reserve
Officer Promotion Management Act of 1996, and Top Five enlisted guidelines provided in
Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 1304.20, Enlisted Personnel Management System, July
28, 2005. The system will provide for promotion opportunity and timing for advancing Airmen
with the appropriate experience and skill to fill projected requirements, and for preventing
Airmen from being promoted who should not be advanced to the next higher grade.
3. The Regular Air Force and Air Reserve Components will:
     3.1. Select Airmen for promotion based on potential to serve in the next higher grade.
     Selections will be made using the fully qualified or best qualified concept, which values duty
     performance and potential based on that performance, but not to the exclusion of other
     factors.
     3.2. Take steps, when appropriate, to demote Airmen to a grade commensurate with their
     demonstrated abilities and skills.
4. Responsibilities. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:
     4.1. The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for policy oversight and advocacy of the
     Air Force’s education programs and for interfacing with the Office of the Secretary of
     Defense staff concerning development of DoD policy and legislative initiatives. The
     Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR)
     discharges these responsibilities as delegated by the Secretary of the Air Force.
     4.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1) develops,
     coordinates, and executes personnel policy and essential procedural guidance for managing
     promotion programs in collaboration with the Chief, Air Force Reserves and the Director of
     the Air National Guard.
     4.3. The Chief, Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) executes personnel policy and essential
     procedural guidance for Air Force Reserve personnel and oversees the Reserve force.
     4.4. The Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF) executes personnel policy and essential
     procedural guidance for Air National Guard personnel and oversees the Air National Guard
     force.
     4.5. The Air Force major commands execute Air Force policy with regard to promotions and
     demotions in their respective commands.
