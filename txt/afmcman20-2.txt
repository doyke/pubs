                                          Chapter 1

       INTRODUCTION TO THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SAP)

1.1. Purpose.
   1.1.1. The SAP is a group of programs authorized by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA)
   of 1976 and Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended through which the US Department
   of Defense (DoD) or commercial contractors provide defense articles and services in support
   of national policies and objectives. SAPs allow the transfer of defense articles and services
   to international organizations and friendly foreign Governments via sales, grants, leases, or
   loans to help friendly nations and allies deter and defend against aggression, promote the
   sharing of common defense burdens and help foster regional stability. The Defense Security
   Cooperation Agency (DSCA) outlines these components in DSCA Manual 5105.38-M,
   Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM). This manual provides procedures on
   these transfers that are applicable to Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military
   Financing (FMF) grants or loans, Excess Defense Articles (EDA), and Commercial Export .
   It also covers sales licensed under Section 30 the AECA of 1976 (procedures for that permit
   the United States Government [USG] to sell defense articles and services to U.S. companies
   in connection with a proposed direct commercial sale). The manual references drawdowns
   without providing detailed procedures. Detailed procedures are provided in DSCA H-1,
   DSCA Handbook for Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) Drawdown of Defense Articles and
   Services.
   1.1.2. This instruction was developed for the benefit of, and use by, Security Assistance
   (SA) purchasers to maintain a standardized system process. General policies and procedures
   for implementing approved programs are in DSCA Manual 5105.38-M and AFMAN 16-101,
   International Affairs and Security Assistance Management.
1.2. Scope.
   1.2.1. This manual provides guidance to Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)
   organizations that are responsible for providing materiel management logistical support to
   foreign countries participating in the International Logistics Program, to include the Air
   Force Reserve and ANG units .
   1.2.2. It does not include the leasing of defense articles to FMS customers. For information
   concerning this topic, reference AFI 23-119, Exchange, Sale, or Temporary Custody of
   Nonexcess Personal Property.

   process. “ND” numbers and non-standard items are excluded from this 90-day criterion.
   3.1.2. Problems that cannot be solved at the distribution level will be sent to the AFSAC
   case manager.
   3.1.3. All shipments from on-hand stock will be shown on DD Form 1348-1A, Issue
   Release/Receipt Document. All shipments from contractual sources will be shown on DD
   Form 250, Materiel Inspection and Receiving Report, or DD Form 1155, Order for Supplies
   or Services.
   3.1.4. Release/receipt documents must show the stock number, nomenclature, unit price,
   Document Control Number (DCN), supplementary address, and total cost. The nomenclature
   is added on to all copies of the release/receipt documents.
   3.1.5. One additional book of three copies of DD Form 1348-lA or DD Form 1149,
   Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, is necessary on FMS shipments. The
   release/receipt documents must be prepared and distributed as shown in Section 6I.
   3.1.6. Appropriate follow-up on all back orders and buy actions must be done to ensure
   timely case closure.
   3.1.7. Final billings will be made as shown in Chapter 5.
3.2. Modifications to Systems, Subsystems, and Equipment.
   3.2.1. Technical Order (TO) 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating
   System, provides AFMC guidance on modification management. FMS customers must be
   told when manufacture part numbers may change and when modifications may be approved
   for equipment and spare parts of AF origin. The AFLCMC PM will do the modification
   before issuance of the LOA at the first preliminary meeting:
      3.2.1.1. Part Number changes. Each AFLCMC Program Executive Office (PEO)/PM
      will establish:
          3.2.1.1.1. A focal point and procedures to tell FMS customers of part number
          changes. Local forms are not authorized for this purpose.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  19


          3.2.1.1.2. Procedures to ensure all potential FMS customers know of the problems
          they may face if they fail to get part number changes.
       3.2.1.2. Modifications.
          3.2.1.2.1. The PM tells all affected SA customers (including those customers who
          bought systems or components outside of SA channels) of modification details.
          Managers of engines, major subassemblies, or SE who need help in developing a list
          of customers using the equipment affected by modifications will contact the
          applicable weapon PM (informational copies of correspondence will be sent to the
          AFSAC). For equipment modifications with multiple weapon system applications,
          the IMS will ask for historical stock number interrogations from SAMIS from
          AFLCMC/WFS (Comm/Information) to help decide which FMS customers have the
          equipment. Each affected FMS customer must be told of the modification. A sample
          LOA amendment/modification change request is in AFMAN 16-101. The AFLCMC
          provides kits only. Installation is the FMS customer's responsibility.
          3.2.1.2.2. Technical problems on the installation of a Class IV or V modification will
          be sent to the OPR for the modification, usually the responsible AFLCMC PM.
          Procedural problems on the FMS case will be sent to the AFSAC case manager.
          3.2.1.2.3. The AFSAC case manager will review the case supply activity each month
          by requesting a SAMIS “Comprehensive Requisition/Custom Commitment Data”
          product, PCN: U-W00l.-HBC Quick Access Identification (QAID) 165A, to make
          sure suspenses are met and that Class IV modifications are included in delivery
          reporting and billing.
   3.2.2. Notification of Defects and Safety Hazards. AFMC PMs and IMSs will include FMS
   and Grant Aid (GA) customers in all notices of materiel defects, unsatisfactory performance,
   and safety hazards. This correspondence does not go through the AFSAC case manager, but
   goes directly from the PM/IMS to the FMS/GA customer; using the United States (US)
   Military Assistance Advisory Group mission addresses in TO 00-35D-54. Informational
   copies go to the AFSAC case manager.
3.3. Special Instructions for Diversion of FMS or Air Force Materiel.
   3.3.1. Every attempt will be made to supply SA requirements within normal procurement
   lead times. The following instructions apply to the processing of FMS requirements for
   investment items. Stock fund items are processed under normal inventory manager Stock
   Control and Distribution (SC&D) system criteria. Release of back orders is by document
   date and priority designator.
       3.3.1.1. The IMS will screen monthly item status reports FMS requisitions. These
       requisitions will be compared against current Due-In Assets (DIA) records to determine
       whether items can be supplied from outstanding contracts without adversely affecting AF
       support.
       3.3.1.2. If DIAs are indicated, prepare Amended Shipping Instructions (ASI) for direct
       shipment to the FMS customer.
       3.3.1.3. If sufficient item assets are not due in from existing procurement, the IMS will
       take action to get funds and/or procurement authorization when necessary and initiate
 20                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      procurement action to meet FMS requirements. The number of assets procured to meet
      FMS requirements must be identified in shipping instructions for direct shipment to the
      FMS customer. Materiel being procured or stocked for FMS may be diverted to meet
      higher priority requirements only with prior concurrence of the director, DSCA, who will
      obtain policy guidance from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD[P]).
   3.3.2. Materiel being procured or stocked for one FMS customer can be diverted to another
   FMS customer. Before diverting FMS assets from one FMS customer to another, all other
   possible sources for the needed item(s) will be investigated as follows:
      3.3.2.1. Diversion from the AF.
      3.3.2.2. Diversion from other DoD agencies.
      3.3.2.3. Shelf-life extension, if applicable.
   3.3.3. If diversion of FMS assets is the only viable support option, a request for diversion
   with accompanying justification must be submitted to the Director, DSCA for concurrence
   and potential further coordination with OUSD(P). The AFSAC CCM will take the following
   steps to divert FMS assets:
      3.3.3.1. Ask the IMS to provide, in writing, his/her asset position, including shelf stock,
      projected due-ins, due-outs, and any other important information. Ask the IMS to
      recommend the most logical and economical way of supporting the critical FMS
      requirement and identify possible impacts of this recommended action. The IMS will
      also backfill information (i.e., Estimated Ship Date [ESD], price, etc.). Note: The price
      charged to a customer receiving diverted materiel will be the same price charged to the
      losing customer to backfill its requirement.
      3.3.3.2. Coordinate with other AFSAC CCMs to determine whether another FMS
      customer will voluntarily agree to diversion of assets from production (based on the IMS
      data).
      3.3.3.3. If voluntary diversion cannot be obtained from another FMS customer, the
      AFSAC CCM seeking the diversion will prepare a comprehensive justification package
      based on the IMS recommendation IAW command levy procedures in AFMAN 16-101,
      paragraph 7.1.
   3.3.4. The AFSAC CCM seeking materiel diversion must keep all other potentially impacted
   Country Managers (CM) informed of the status of the diversion request.
   3.3.5. The quantity of assets to be diverted will not exceed the quantity needed to satisfy
   urgent requirements. Diversion of materiel will be considered only in exceptional
   circumstances to provide urgent, Interim Supply Support (ISS). Diversions are fully funded
   by FMS customers and are not considered a loan.
3.4. Emergency Acceleration of FMS Support.
   3.4.1. Emergency acceleration of FMS materiel and support is handled on a case-by-case
   basis pursuant to directive authority received from the Joint Staff, DSCA, and/or Secretary of
   the Air Force/International Affairs (SAF/IA). Specific information is needed as early as
   possible to effectively transition from normal to emergency support operations.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  21


  3.4.2. Direction to respond to a declared emergency situation should state the general scope
  of the acceleration effort. The notification will include the following information as
  appropriate:
     3.4.2.1. The FMS customer and applicable case identifiers.
     3.4.2.2. The assigned project code and project nickname (if assigned by the Joint Staff or
     HQ USAF).
     3.4.2.3. Any increase in present case value(s).
     3.4.2.4. Identification of items needed and the quantity.
     3.4.2.5. The assigned project action officers and their points of contact.
     3.4.2.6. The format for any required reports.
     3.4.2.7. Identification of any special provisions regarding the delivery of materiel to the
     customer from the aggregation/supply points.
     3.4.2.8. Use of customer funds to support materiel as it is received in aggregation.
     3.4.2.9. Authority to use a higher requisition priority.
     3.4.2.10. Authority to use command levy procedures.
     3.4.2.11. Authority to use DTS.
     3.4.2.12. Authority to use sole source emergency acquisition .
     3.4.2.13. Authority to aggregate materiel.
  3.4.3. Depending on the magnitude of the emergency conditions/contingency operations
  giving rise to the acceleration effort, AFMC/CC will determine whether the situation
  warrants activation of the HQ AFMC Battle Staff. The AFSAC will augment command post
  operations as required. In addition to taskings received through the HQ AFMC Battle Staff,
  the AFSAC will notify all Sources of Supply (SOS) about specific program support
  requirements. In addition to the information provided by SAF/IA, this notification will
  include:
     3.4.3.1. A listing of equipment, part numbers or NSNs requiring emergency acceleration.
     3.4.3.2. Identification of the AFSAC project officer and points of contact.
     3.4.3.3. Supplemental instructions as necessary.
  3.4.4. When the acceleration effort does not warrant activation of the HQ AFMC Battle
  Staff, the AFLCMC will be the AFMC focal point and will be responsible for monitoring the
  acceleration effort. At the discretion of AFLCMC/WF, the AFLCMC may establish a
  functional command post operation to oversee SA support efforts. The AFLCMC will:
     3.4.4.1. Complete all activities listed in paragraph 3.4.3
     3.4.4.2. Inform HQ AFMC staff offices about the emergency and obtain their assistance
     as needed .
     3.4.4.3. Monitor the progress of the acceleration effort.
  3.4.5. SOSs will:
 22                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      3.4.5.1. Determine, in conjunction with HQ AFMC/A4 and AFLCMC , the location of
      needed materiel aggregation point(s) if applicable.
      3.4.5.2. Monitor project progress and provide guidance and direction to supporting
      activities.
   3.4.6. When authorization to ship to the aggregation point is given by SAF/IA, the lead
   CCCM or SAPM (if designated) will make available, upon request by the AFSAC, copies of
   selected consignee reports for each source of supply IAW with AFMCMAN 23-5, Stock
   Control System (D035), Volume 5, Special Support Stock Control (SSSC) System
   (D035D)(when published):
      3.4.6.1. The Selected Supply Status for Consignee Report includes: stock number, DCN,
      project code, SOS, Unit of Issue (UI), quantity requisitioned, quantity shipped, quantity
      on hand, quantity unsupplied, quantity cancelled, latest status, and substitute stock
      number (as appropriate).
      3.4.6.2. Selected Percent Completion for Consignee Report, which gives cost data by the
      Air Force Supply Directive (AFSD).
   3.4.7. When using these procedures, the aggregating CCM or SAPM will prepare the
   country out shipment documents on the aggregated materiel. Notification will be sent to the
   AFSAC, SAF/IA and the Security Cooperation Organization (SCO) involved.
3.5. Emergency Suspension/Cancellation of FMS Support.
   3.5.1. Under unusual and compelling circumstances, certain strategic, tactical or political
   considerations may require the suspension or cancellation of the provision of materiel,
   services and technical data to particular countries. When the US Department of State (DoS)
   makes this determination, DSCA will issue instructions to the military departments, Defense
   Logistics (DLA) and the General Services Administration (GSA).
      3.5.1.1. SAF/IA provides implementing guidance regarding the degree or scope of
      suspension (for example, temporary, partial, complete cut-off, etc.) to AFMC, other
      Major Commands (MAJCOM), and AFSAC IAW AFMAN 16-101, paragraph 7.5.19.
      Temporary suspension is defined as temporarily suspending support to a customer. Partial
      suspension will apply to specific items, programs, and/or FMS cases. Complete cut-off
      means suspending all support. Implementing guidance will typically address the
      following considerations:
          3.5.1.1.1. If all deliveries of FMS materiel and services to the particular country are
          to be suspended immediately.
          3.5.1.1.2. If release of new FMS LOA can be made.
          3.5.1.1.3. If any shipment of FMS materiel under USG control will be loaded at the
          Port of Embarkation (POE). If materiel is in transit, SAF/IA may provide directions
          to discharge the cargo at the nearest Port of Debarkation (POD) at which US/DoD
          port detachment is located. Cargo will be retained until disposition instructions are
          received. DoD components will store items by the most economical means possible
          pending further disposition instructions and in a way that promotes asset
          accountability and preserves asset condition.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    23


        3.5.1.1.4. If materiel ready for shipment from a contractor will be retained at the
        contractor facility or shipped to a DoD storage facility. Arrangements for storage
        may be made with the manufacturer provided such arrangements are the most
        economical.
        3.5.1.1.5. If requisitions submitted by the FMS customer will be filled, suspended,
        diverted to another FMS customer, returned to stock inventory, or canceled.
        3.5.1.1.6. If service contracts with the country are to be terminated and whether USG
        and/or contractor personnel in-country should be evacuated.
     3.5.1.2. If the suspension is only partial, the instructions may be to continue shipment of
     certain types of materiel to a customer-owned, operated, or controlled facility in the
     CONUS. The AF will keep custody and control of the shipment until it is delivered to
     the FMS customer facility on a government-to-government transfer basis.
     3.5.1.3. Suspensions may evolve to complete cancellation action as decided by the DoS.
     AFSAC will adhere to specific guidance provided by SAF regarding the disposition of
     items, funds, etc. based upon case-by-case reviews.
     3.5.1.4. For items where title has passed to the customer, but the items are in storage or
     in transit within the US under the control of the foreign customer or its agent, instructions
     to deny export of such materiel are the responsibility of the DoS and will be handled by
     the DoS directly with the representative of the customer concerned.
  3.5.2. AFSAC Responsibilities:
     3.5.2.1. Within 48 hours of a suspension notification, transmit a priority message to
     impacted AFMC organizations specifying the: country affected, date of suspension,
     date/time group and source of implementing direction, AFSAC Point of Contact (POC),
     immediate actions to be taken, and projected date that more detailed instructions will be
     provided.
     3.5.2.2. Within 10 days of a suspension notification, identify to SAF/IA major end items
     and significant secondary items which are en route through DTS, items scheduled for
     release within 30 days, and items on order but not yet shipped. Within 21 days of the
     suspension notification, inform SAF/IA about all other materiel en route scheduled for
     shipment within 30 days or on order but not shipped. The report will identify the total
     uncommitted dollar value on Blanket-Order (B/O) cases and supply support arrangement
     cases.
     3.5.2.3. Determine in coordination with HQ AFMC/A4/FM and DLA which DLA
     warehouse/depot will process materiel to be returned.
     3.5.2.4. Ensure no new LOAs are released to country.
     3.5.2.5. Take action to suspend all incoming requisitions.
     3.5.2.6. Provide AFMC center international affairs focal point offices a list of those
     requirements (materiel and services) that cannot be automatically controlled and are to be
     suspended by NSN, DCN, or other identifying reference.
     3.5.2.7. Provide AFMC center international affairs focal point offices a listing of open
     requisitions/requirements.

                      TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND CONTROLS

4.1. Purpose. Disclosure policy decisions for release of information are made on a case-by-case
basis using National Disclosure Policy (NDP). The procedures in this chapter apply only to NDP
for systems or component sales sponsored by the AF.
4.2. Releasability.
   4.2.1. Letters of request (LOR) for LOAD or LOAs for a “D,” “Q,” “S,” or “Y” case,
   significant military equipment, or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), Critical
   Program Information (CPI), critical components, critical functions, or classified articles or
   services are processed as follows:
       4.2.1.1. The AFSAC CCM will take a copy of the LOR to the Foreign Disclosure Policy
       Office (FDPO) to determine if there are any releasability points to be considered. The
       Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO) will process the request and make the releasability
       determination IAW NDP.
       4.2.1.2. The AFSAC CCM will include a statement in the LOAD request relating the
       information received from the disclosure office. The request will also task the LOAD
       submitter to indicate whether or not any known releasability problems exist.
       4.2.1.3. Exceptions to the NDP. The Air Staff may receive a tasking from DSCA to
       sponsor an exception to the NDP. If AFSAC case managers receive a request without Air
       Staff coordination, they will send the request directly to the Air Staff for action.
4.3. Use of Technical Order (TO) Library by Foreign Nationals. Foreign nationals are not
authorized use of TO libraries. Requests for TO information can be met through “P” case
requisitioning. TO requisitions are processed in the Security Assistance Tech Order Data System
(SATODS). Procedures for requisitioning are outlined in TO 00-5-19, Security Assistance
Technical Order Program Manual SATOP.

PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) CASES

Section 5A—GENERAL FMS GUIDANCE

5.1. General Instructions.
   5.1.1. All pricing for FMS sales that will result in a LOA will be accomplished in the
   Defense Security Assistance Management System (DSAMS).
   5.1.2. Pricing for FMS requirements will be accomplished IAW DoD 7000.14-R,
   Department of Defense Financial Management Regulations (FMRs), Volume 15, Security
   Assistance Policy and Procedures, and DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 9.
   5.1.3. Commercial items, as defined by DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, usually are not sold
   through FMS. If not available in the country, these items may be requisitioned by using
   advice code “3B” in the MILSTRIP requisition. Items which are coded local-purchase or
   local manufacture by DoD and are not available in the country may be requisitioned using
   advice code “2A.” See DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.15 for a complete list of advice codes.
   5.1.4. The AF does not buy materiel in anticipation of FMS except under a CLSSA, where
   stocks are prefunded by FMS customers or under the Special Defense Acquisition Fund
   (SDAF).
   5.1.5. AF FMS requirements for items which are the responsibility of DLA or GSA are met
   by funding and passing actions to DLA or GSA activities. Valid NSN items which are used
   by AF, but are Army- or Navy-managed will be filled out of stock, if stocks are above the
   appropriate levels, or they will be funded and passed to the managing service SOS.
   5.1.6. The MILSTRIP and Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System
   (UMMIPS) provisions apply to FMS requisitioning and issuing of materiel from all DoD
   distribution systems (reference Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI)
   4120.02C, Assignment of Movement and Mobility Priority.
   5.1.7. Under the provisions of the FMS offer/release procedure, the media and status codes
   for FMS transactions are codes that direct status to the supplementary address field, that is,
   “U,” “V,” or “X.” Refer to DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.04 for a list of media and status
   codes. The addresses which get status data are in DLM 4000.25, Defense Logistics
   Management System, Volume 6, Logistics Systems Interoperability Support Services, Chapter
   3, Military Assistance Program Address Directory (MAPAD) System . The addresses match
   specific FF codes. The media and status codes, the option code, and the FF code are
   determined at the time the case is established, and are part of the International Program
   Directive (IPD).
   5.1.8. Shipping instructions to the contractor for materiel bought specifically for FMS allow
   for direct shipment to the FMS customer according to the FMS case. ASI action must meet
   the criteria in AFI 23-101, Section 2C, Financial Management. To ensure proper
   identification and control of items coming from a contractor, the information in the
   supplementary address will be part of the instructions to the contractor.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    27


   5.1.9. Delivery time of new production items (including new procurement for depot stock
   replenishment) or rehabilitation items should not exceed the time that would be needed to
   buy or rehabilitate the same items in the same quantities for the AF.
   5.1.10. Materiel needing technical order compliance, including Time Compliance Technical
   Orders (TCTO), will not be issued unless the FMS customer has agreed to accept it before it
   is shipped.
   5.1.11. A 100 percent inspection of all FMS reparable return receipts is required. Special
   attention must be given to dated items to meet the criteria in DoD 4140.27-M, Shelf-Life Item
   Management Manual.
   5.1.12. Defined Order (D/O) cases will be shipped as materiel becomes available until 100
   percent complete, if shipment is within the dollar limitations of the case. With the exception
   of unit pact adjustment, no item will be quantitatively increased or decreased. Unit packs will
   not be broken to meet FMS requirements. Such issues will not be considered overages and
   should not be reported as discrepancies.
   5.1.13. DoD excess personal property sales will be done by the DLA Disposition Services or
   the foreign excess sales office, as appropriate.
   5.1.14. Depending on the situation, the FMS requirements may be cancelled as follows:
       5.1.14.1. When D035 results in a computer coded “C” status card and it has been
       determined that the item cannot be supplied due to obsolescence, or other reasons, the
       item may be cancelled without prior approval of the FMS customer.
       5.1.14.2. When a buy is needed and there is a large price variance, or long-lead time is
       given (in excess of 30 months), the AFSAC case manager and FMS customer will be
       apprised of the situation. The FMS customer can then accept the conditions, or authorize
       cancellation of the order and buy the item elsewhere.
5.2. Follow-On Support Transactions Involving Less-Than-Economic-Order-Quantity
(EOQ).
   5.2.1. Sometimes requests are received for Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing data
   or for LOAD for items which cannot be supplied from stock and that cannot be immediately
   bought through a normal acquisition because they represent less than an EOQ. The response
   to such a request should give the following information to the FMS customer:
       5.2.1.1. If the contractor will provide the quantity requested under separate acquisition
       and if so, when.
       5.2.1.2. If a USG buy is planned for the near future, the expected price, and the expected
       delay in supplying the item if the requirement were held for such a buy.
   5.2.2. This guidance does not apply to individual requisitions, but only to requests for ROM,
   LOAD, or an LOA.
5.3. Aircraft, Missiles, and Other System Sales.
   5.3.1. All requests for large, complex equipment must have considerable study, adjustment
   and negotiation before acceptance, and they are processed according to Chapter 6 of this
 28                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   manual. AFSAC must make sure that the development and refinement of all LOAD meet the
   FMS customer's request.
   5.3.2. If sending the FMS customer complete initial spares/equipment packages before first
   aircraft delivery would result in production schedules that exceed capacity, the note,
   “Delivery of initial support equipment and spares will be phased to coincide with actual
   logistics requirements associated with the phased delivery of the aircraft,” should be in the
   LOAD and the LOA. Delivery schedules will be developed during the definitization and
   provisioning conferences. The recommendation to use a phased delivery schedule will be
   made by the PM who will notify the applicable IMS. Phasing will not apply to submission of
   requirements and initiating Purchase Requests (PR).               Total requirements for
   spares/equipment developed during the definitization and provisioning conferences, along
   with delivery schedules set, will be included in the initial PR and be made a part of the
   contract requirements.
5.4. Channels for Submitting FMS Requests.
   5.4.1. Requests for materiel and/or services are forwarded to one of three organizations: the
   Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA); AFSAC; and
   the Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT) Squadron.
      5.4.1.1. Requirements for the following items and/or area are routed through SAF/IA:

   5.4.2. DoD excess property will be bought from the DLA Disposition Services, Federal
   Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3092. An exception to this guidance is the sale of
   excess aircraft. Such sales are covered in AFMAN 16-101, Chapter 7, under sales of AF
   inventory aircraft.
5.5. Sole Source Acquisition.
   5.5.1. The AF normally uses competitive acquisition for spares, spare parts, equipment,
   services, and follow-on support when competitive sources are available. However, FMS
   customers may request sole source acquisition from a specific contractor for defense articles
   and/or services. The request must be in writing, with adequate justification, and follow
   procedures in DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 6. Also see AFMAN 16-101, Chapter 4,
   Sole Source Requests.
       5.5.1.1. Purpose. Sole source acquisition is used to meet requirements requested by the
       FMS customer. Procedures necessary to meet the requirements will vary based upon the
       objective for the sole source acquisition. Situations where sole source procurement may
       be justifiable could include, but are not limited to, the following as cited in DSCA
       Manual 5105.38-M:
   5.5.2. Limitations and Restrictions:
       5.5.2.1. The number or frequency of sole source requests should be kept to the absolute
       minimum.
       5.5.2.2. USG personnel may not solicit sole source requests from potential customers.
       Once the purchaser decides to submit a sole source request, USG representatives must
       remain objective in providing options to the purchaser and cannot recommend one
       contractor over another.
 30                                                        AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       5.5.2.3. Sole source acquisition is not authorized unless stated in the signed LOA.
       Requirements for sole source acquisition, determined after the LOA has been signed,
       require notification to the country manager. The country manager will then submit an
       LOA amendment with the sole source acquisition authorization. The note in the LOA
       authorizing sole source acquisition must clearly state the conditions and purpose.

Section 5B—PROCESSING FMS REQUESTS

5.6. Letter of Request (LOR). The submission of an LOR by a foreign country is the first step
in the lifecycle of an FMS case. For additional information concerning the submission of an
LOR, reference AFI 16-105 (IP), Joint Security Cooperation Education and Training; AFMAN
16-101; DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 5, Table C5.T6; and DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15.
   5.6.1. Once LORs are received, they will be entered into DSAMS by completing the
   DSAMS Customer Request Screen.
       5.6.1.1. Classified requests and/or requests for classified/CUI materiel will be processed
       IAW DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapters 3 through 5 and AFI 16-201, Air Force
       Foreign Disclosure and Technology Program.
   5.6.2. The receiving organization (i.e., AFSAC or FMS pricer) will review the LOR to
   determine the appropriate approval channels and for completeness. All incomplete requests
   will be returned to the requestor through the channels used to receive the LOR.
       5.6.2.1. The Implementing Agency (IA) receives a LOR and validates it as discussed in
       DSCA Manual 5105.38-M.
       5.6.2.2. The IA will ensure that an eligible purchaser sent the request through proper
       FMS channels ( reference DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 5, paragraph C5.1.3.5.).
       5.6.2.3. If the request is valid, it is reviewed for releasability and categorized as either a
       request for P&A or a request for an LOA. (The customer should specify in the request
       whether they are seeking an LOA or P&A.)
   5.6.3. Requests for Significant Military Equipment (SME) or Major Defense Equipment
   (MDE) must be coordinated with the appropriate US embassy. For non-MDE requests, the
   LOR is forwarded directly to the IA with an information copy to the Unified Command
   (UCOM), the Bureau of Political Military Affairs (BPMA), the DoS, the Office of the
   Secretary of Defense (OSD) and DSCA. For exceptions to the standard distribution, refer to
   DSCA Manual 5105.38-M.
5.7. Establishing the Request. The case-managing organization will use the DSAMS Initialize
Case Screen to establish a new case.
   5.7.1. References for case initialization. Personnel initializing the case will have to refer to
   their internal guidance on initializing cases.
   5.7.2. Once the request/case information is entered into DSAMS, the IA will task the
   applicable SOS(s) to provide pricing data to complete the ROM pricing data response.
   5.7.3. All taskings for LOAD and/or P&A will be accomplished through the use of the
   DSAMS workflow task.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    31


   5.7.4. Pricing for ROM data requests conducted by AFSAC will be tasked in DSAMS.
   5.7.5. Workflow tasks can be forwarded to another office or user requesting that they act on
   a case, line, or other requirement. DSAMS is used to keep track of workflow tasks.
5.8. Requests for Pricing and Availability (also referred to as ROM Data).
   5.8.1. ROM data should be used by FMS customers only for preliminary review and
   planning for the possible purchase of a defense article or service. ROM data are not valid for
   use in programming budget requests or for preparation of an LOA.
   5.8.2. Special conditions (e.g., price increases, delivery delays, equipment in poor condition)
   that may cause the estimates to go past acceptable bounds should be provided to the FMS
   customer, unless this would result in disclosure of classified information, US force planning
   information, or data which otherwise are sensitive to US interests.
   5.8.3. Only specific data provided by the AF will be used. Unless more specific country
   data are provided, ROM data are developed based on available information, using standard
   AF configurations and program data. Standard factors may be applied to basic system
   estimates to get support data (such as percentage of materiel estimate for initial spares).
   Contractor price/delivery estimates are not necessary for ROM studies.
   5.8.4. AFSAC gets requests for pricing data either directly from the customer or from the
   Air Staff. All systems sales pricing data requests coming to AFSAC must come from the Air
   Staff. Any pricing data requests sent out of channels will be sent to the AFSAC before any
   other action is taken.
   5.8.5. If a follow-on support request is received by AFSAC, and it is a request for SME
   (DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 5), it will be returned to the Air Staff for coordination
   with the DSCA before further processing.
   5.8.6. For stock-numbered, D/O requirements use SAMIS QAID 283 report to obtain ROM
   data. If any of the items are DLA- or GSA-managed, report the standard price adjusted for
   inflation and standard Customer Wait Time (CWT) in the ROM pricing data report (nine
   months for DLA, 6 months for GSA).
   5.8.7. For a system sale, request a one-year price parts package along with the ROM request.
   The request will include the:
       5.8.7.1. Number of aircraft/equipment items to be supported at each deployment site.
       5.8.7.2. Number of maintenance locations.
       5.8.7.3. Level of maintenance capability at each site (replace/repair/throw away).
       5.8.7.4. Utilization of programming data, to include limitations on down time.
   5.8.8. Include a requirement in request to the SOS, if pricing and CWT data for spare parts
   are needed.
   5.8.9. Review completed ROM data and include the following note: “The provisions of the
   foregoing ROM data do not constitute an agreement between the USG and the Government
   of ___________ nor a USG commitment to provide the articles or services for which these
   estimates are provided.”
 32                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   5.8.10. Send ROM data to the FMS customer or Air Staff. Add additional costs that would
   normally be included in an LOA, such as Packing Crating, Handling and Transportation
   (PCH&T), government provided engineering services, insurance (if asked for by the FMS
   customer), credit charges, and administrative surcharges.
   5.8.11. Give the FMS customer the checklist of planning information, when appropriate, to
   make sure there is complete information, as in the case of a major weapon system.
   5.8.12. The responsible SOS for ROM data will accomplish the following upon notification.
       5.8.12.1. Get ROM data requests via DSAMS tasking.
       5.8.12.2. Complete a preliminary review. Non-prime items on the ROM data will be
       sent to the correct SOS for action.
       5.8.12.3. Tell the AFSAC if the original assigned suspense date cannot be met, with the
       reason for the delay, and give a new suspense date that can be met.
       5.8.12.4. Get the ROM data from the PM/IMS and verify that the estimate is correct.
       5.8.12.5. Do a quality review for completeness and accuracy.
       5.8.12.6. Forward completed ROM estimate to AFSAC for review and forwarding to
       SAF/IA.
   5.8.13. The IMS will accomplish the following upon notification.
       5.8.13.1. Get ROM request from the SOS.
       5.8.13.2. Determine if the suspense date can be met, and if not, tell the SOS to advise
       AFSAC of the pending missed suspense.
       5.8.13.3. If a NSN is not available, provide ROM data for the substitute/replacement
       item.
       5.8.13.4. Ask for clarification from the FMS customer through the SOS            if item
       identification or classification is not clear.
       5.8.13.5. Based on consultations with program managers, include all data requirements
       such as technical orders, provisioning documentation, engineering prescreening, design
       change notice, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), etc., in the project costs.
       5.8.13.6. Identify DLA/GSA/US Army/US Navy managed items and further advise
       requesting office. No further action will be taken unless otherwise instructed by the
       requesting office.
       5.8.13.7. Make sure ROM data are accurate and of high quality, and return the completed
       P&A backup data to the SOS by the suspense date.
5.9. Determining Pricing for LOAD. The AECA of 1976, as amended, requires the USG to
determine and recover all costs relating to FMS except where authority exists for cost reduction
or waiver.
   5.9.1. Sections 21 and 22 of the AECA state that FMS agreements must generally recover
   costs (base price + additives) as follows:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                     33


     5.9.1.1. In the case of a defense article not intended to be replaced at the time the
     agreement (LOA) is entered into – not less than the actual value thereof.
     5.9.1.2. In the case of a defense article intended to be replaced – the estimated cost of the
     replacement of such article, including the contract or production costs less any
     depreciation in the value of such article.
     5.9.1.3. In the case of new procurement – the full amount of such contract (which will
     insure the USG against any loss on the contract), plus appropriate charges for:
         5.9.1.3.1. Administrative services calculated on an average percentage basis.
         5.9.1.3.2. A proportionate amount of any Nonrecurring Costs (NC) of research,
         development, and production of MDE (not applicable to cases wholly financed with
         MAP grant and/or non-repayable FMS credit funds or to any case for which NC
         waiver has been granted).
         5.9.1.3.3. Ordinary operating costs associated with the sale from stock or
         procurement of defense articles or services.
  5.9.2. The following references provide additional information concerning the Pricing
  Activity (PA) defining the requirements and developing the structure for pricing: DoD
  7000.14-R, Volume 15; DoD Directive (DoDD) 2140.02, Recoupment of Nonrecurring Costs
  (NCs) on Sales of U.S. Items; DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual.
  5.9.3. Basic methodology involves the determination of a base price (stock or procurement)
  plus additional authorized charges (“additives,” consisting of operating costs and investment
  costs).
  5.9.4. To determine a base price, the pricer must determine whether the requirement will be
  fulfilled from stock, or whether it must be procured.
     5.9.4.1. Stock sales may consist of materiel (consisting of major and principal items from
     inventory, or excess materiel) or services.
         5.9.4.1.1. Materiel sales may consist of major and principal items from inventory, or
         excess materiel.
             5.9.4.1.1.1. Materiel - major. The FMS base price established for a major system
             or item (e.g., ship, aircraft, tank, etc.) or an individual part (e.g., component of a
             major item, such as an aircraft engine) depends on whether the item is to be
             replaced or not.
                5.9.4.1.1.1.1. Computation for item not to be replaced. The unit cost is the
                most recent procurement cost of the series/model being sold plus the cost of
                any modification or improvement incorporated after production. A reduction
                may be made for actual differences due to the major or principal item’s age or
                condition; however, the price is never to be lower than the scrap value. If
                applicable, the prorated cost of any major overhaul or outfitting accomplished
                prior to the sale must also be added.
                5.9.4.1.1.1.2. Computation for item to be replaced depends on whether an in-
                kind or improved-item replacement will take place (for this methodology to be
                used, the item must be included in the president’s budget).
34                                        AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


     5.9.4.1.1.1.2.1. In-kind item replacement cost computation.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Determine the normal expected peacetime useful life.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.2. Determine life remaining.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.3. Develop a percentage relationship between them.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.4. Apply that percentage to the replacement cost (actual
        if available; otherwise, it must be estimated). The result is the unit cost.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.5. For example, assume the item has a total life of 10
        years with a projected remaining life of eight years. Consider further its
        replacement cost of $50,000.00. When this amount is multiplied by the
        remaining life factor of 80 percent (8 year remaining life/10 year total
        life), the results are 80 percent X $50,000.00 = $40,000.00 unit cost.
     5.9.4.1.1.1.2.2. Improved-item replacement cost computation. The same
     computational procedure applies as with in-kind item replacement; however,
     the replacement cost of an “improved item” will most likely be different
     (higher) than the replacement cost of an item “in kind” (assuming the same
     model and series).
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.2.1. If the FMS request to be priced is deemed a major
        weapon system or components, the request is subsequently forwarded
        via the contracting officer to a contractor.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.2.2. If the system or components are managed organically,
        then the pricing would be done internally.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.2.3. In certain cases, the FMS pricer at a SOS may work in
        conjunction with SAF to price items. For example, in cases involving
        inventory aircraft, missiles, and helicopters, SAF computes pricing and
        provides it to the country director who would, in turn, pass it along to
        the SAPM for inclusion in the LOA IAW AFMAN 16-101, paragraph
        4.5.7.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.2.4. Upon identifying the tasking as a request for
        individual parts, the PA initiates a request (via E-mail, phone, fax, or in
        person) to the IM for the part price.
        5.9.4.1.1.1.2.2.5. If the item is in stock, or if recent FMS pricing data
        exists, the IM references these to apply similar pricing to that part (for
        an AF stocked item, costs from the AF IM need to be obtained). For
        “repair and return” items, the IM references the D043 (Master Item
        Identification Control System), a contractor, or other service to
        determine the repair cost. A repair/replace scenario is usually easier and
        takes less time since existing off-the-shelf inventory is used to fulfill the
        item request. If there are no FMS pricing data for the specified item, the
        request is forwarded through a contracting officer to a contractor for
        pricing.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  35


            5.9.4.1.1.2. Excess materiel.
                5.9.4.1.1.2.1. EDAs are items that are excess to the Approved Force
                Acquisition and Approved Force Retention Stock requirements of all DoD
                components, and are sold on a first-come-first-served basis.
                5.9.4.1.1.2.2. The IM typically makes the recommendation of “excess” (to
                both AF and DoD requirements). EDA are sold in an as-is-where-is condition
                and any costs associated with repairing or modifying such materiel are
                considered additive.
                5.9.4.1.1.2.3. The cost of excess items is the highest of market value as
                hardware, scrap value, or fair value based on DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15,
                Chapter 7, Table 7-2
                5.9.4.1.1.2.4. The standard cost equation in its simplest form, is the original
                item price less a markdown, plus development costs.
                5.9.4.1.1.2.5. The procedure for the determination of “excess” varies and it is
                important to keep these “excess” avenues separate (inventory assets available
                for sale but not formally declared excess, excess defense articles, presidential
                drawdowns, etc.). Within the AFSAC International Programs,
                AFLCMC/WFN (Policy)for example, the SOS FMS EDA focal point sends
                out an E-mail with an EDA spares offer for a particular weapon system. The
                E-mail should list the items requested NSN, nomenclature, quantity, federal
                acquisition code, acquisition value of the asset, and SOS. A notification is
                then sent to the country having the weapon system for which the spare parts
                are being offered. In turn, the country forwards the excess listing and the
                specific conditions/instructions for obtaining the assets.
                5.9.4.1.1.2.6. AFLCMC/WFN will inform the appropriate Country Desk
                Officer at SAF/IA, the EDA POC at SAF/IA, AFSAC CCMs, and FLOs.
                Countries have 90 days to respond if they want any of the assets before the
                SOS sends them to disposal. If the country responds, AFLCMC/WFN
                prepares a “Request for Congressional Notification” letter to the appropriate
                SAF/IA Country Desk Officer and informs the AFSAC CCM, SAF/IA EDA
                POC, and country in question. They will also request notifications of any
                congressional approval/disapproval. Once congressional approval is received,
                the AFSAC CCM takes over and prepares the appropriate LOA, modification,
                cases/lines, etc.
        5.9.4.1.2. Services (personnel).      Personnel support costs pay for program
        management, technical services, training, etc. These services must be priced to
        recover all costs to the government. These services shall be priced to recover all costs
        to the government IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Chapter 7. The base price for
        these costs includes the following:
     5.9.4.2. Procurement. Defense articles procured for direct delivery are priced to recover
     full contract cost plus applicable surcharges.
36                                                 AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


     5.9.4.2.1. Costs may need to be revised from time to time due to increases in labor,
     materiel or other variables. The cost principles utilized, in general, are the same as
     those used in pricing defense contracts covering items for DoD use. However,
     recognition is given to other reasonable and allowable contractor costs and risks to
     the extent permitted by the procurement regulations. DFARS 225.7303-2, Foreign
     Acquisition – Cost of Doing Business with a Foreign Government or International
     Organization provides the allowable costs and cost limits that may be passed on FMS
     procurements. The cost of deviations from USG configurations and special technical
     data desired by a foreign government is included as an added charge to the foreign
     government.
     5.9.4.2.2. The new procurement price may also include recovery of nonrecurring
     research and development and nonrecurring production costs on cash cases as
     specified in DoDD 2140.02. If the sale is for items diverted from AF delivery
     schedules and replaced by later production, the price is the current production cost or
     replacement production cost, whichever is higher.
     5.9.4.2.3. The LOA total cost for a line item from new procurement may be
     composed of the contract cost plus applicable charges for nonrecurring production
     and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Government-Furnished
     Materiel (GFM), contract administration, and other special considerations such as the
     cost of administering an offset program (see DSCA Manual 5105.38-M for discussion
     of offset costs).
     5.9.4.2.4. After determining the base price for an FMS item and/or service, the pricer
     then completes the line estimate in DSAMS. Any change to the line pricing or line
     notes must be coordinated through and/or accomplished by the pricer or pricer’s
     organization to ensure continuity of line execution. In order to complete this step of
     the pricing process, the user should be familiar with both the structures of the
     DSAMS “Case Line Price Estimation Screen” and the fields involved. Specifically,
     the user should have a working knowledge of the Military Articles and Services List
     (MASL), Primary Category Codes (PCC), Indirect Pricing Components (IPC), and
     IPC cost basis.
        5.9.4.2.4.1. The following references provide additional information concerning
        the PA defining the requirements and developing the structure for pricing: DoD
        7000.14-R, Volume 15; DoDD 2140.02; and DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Major
        Defense Equipment List (MDEL).
        5.9.4.2.4.2. The PA develops and loads pricing data and supporting information
        into DSAMS. DSAMS allows the user to price a line or subline for a case, model
        case, price and availability, or profile.
        5.9.4.2.4.3. Pricing must be done at the line level, if there are sub-lines. Pricing
        is accomplished via the Price Estimation Screen in DSAMS (reference Table 5.1.
        below).
        5.9.4.2.4.4. DSAMS assists the user in identifying all components involved in the
        pricing of an item. These components are contained within the Case Line Price
        Estimation Screen, which is defined by three main tabs; Primary Categories, IPCs,
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                      37


              and IPC cost Basis.
              5.9.4.2.4.5. Primary categories are created in DSAMS to assist the user in
              determining the correct IPCs to apply to a requirement. A primary category
              defines the type of support that should be provided; contractor services, shipment
              from excess stock, shipments from procurement, etc.

                   5.9.4.2.4.5.1. When pricing a requirement, the user can identify one or more
                   PCCs that apply to the line or sub-line. For a complete list of PCCs, along
                   with definitions, call up DSAMS Reference Report RP030, Primary Category
                   Code.
            5.9.4.2.4.6. Once the PCCs are selected, a list of potential IPCs will appear (in
            the IPC Tab) that would normally be associated with those PCCs. In addition,
            DSAMS Reference Report RP030 provides a cross reference of possible PCCs to
            IPCs.

               5.9.4.2.4.7. The user reviews the IPCs to ensure that none are missing. If any
               IPCs are missing from the list, the user should select the IPC to add.
               5.9.4.2.4.8. Once all IPCs are added, the user should select each IPC and identify
               the IPC status (if the default status is incorrect), and supply the IPC Price Element
               and IPC fund codes.
     5.9.5. Additive Price Determination. The FMS price is a combination of the base price
     (from PCCs) and additional authorized charges or “additives” (from IPCs) that apply to
     satisfying the requirement. An IPC charge that applies to a specific line on a FMS case is
     referred to as a net case value charge. DSAMS Reference Report RP029, IPC category
     codes, provides a break-out of the net case value and the Packing, Crating, Handling, &
     Transportation (PCH&T), administrative charge and other costs that are displayed on lines 9
     through 12 of the LOA. These additional charges are also categorized as being either
     operating costs or investment costs. General category definitions are provided below.
        5.9.5.1. Operating Costs.
            5.9.5.1.1. Contract Administration Services (CAS) are costs incurred by contract
            administration offices in accomplishing the functions required before and after a
50                                                 AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


     procurement contract is awarded.         Examples include:      review contractor’s
     compensation structure; consent to the placement of subcontracts; perform pre-award
     surveys; perform procurement quality assurance; review and approve, or disapprove,
     contractors’ requests for payments under the progress payments clause; etc.
        5.9.5.1.1.1. The DoD Comptroller (USD[C]) determines the applicable contract
        administration surcharge by dividing the cost of doing contract administration for
        FMS by the anticipated disbursements to contractors, which will be reported to
        DFAS-IN/JAXDB. The CAS surcharge is currently 1.5 percent, based on the
        following breakdown:
            5.9.5.1.1.1.1. Quality Assurance and Inspection 0.5 percent
            5.9.5.1.1.1.2. Other Contract Administrative Services 0.5 percent
            5.9.5.1.1.1.3. Contract Audit 0.5 percent
        5.9.5.1.1.2. The CAS surcharge is added to the LOA blocks (4)(a) and (4)(b) unit
        and extended costs for all articles and services from procurement. For pricing the
        LOA, the surcharge is calculated against the estimated contract cost; at billing, the
        surcharge will be applied to the actual contract cost. The contract administration
        surcharge is subject to waiver in whole or in part under AECA, Section 21(h) for
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and NATO Infrastructure
        Programs.
     5.9.5.1.2. Accessorial costs (PCH&T as found below) represent expenses incident to
     issues, sales, and transfers of materiel that are not included in the standard price or
     contract cost of materiel.
        5.9.5.1.2.1. PCH&T costs are those costs at DoD facilities for labor, materiel, and
        services to take articles from storage, prepare them for shipment, and process the
        documentation. PCH&T charges are no longer applicable to items released from
        DoD stocks that are funded through a WCF. Further, PCH&T costs do not apply
        to sales from procurement unless the item is processed through a DoD
        depot/distribution center. PCH&T charges will only be incorporated where
        applicable (i.e., a C-130 would not normally have associated PCH&T charges)
        and if costs are known, the actual costs should be used. Standard PCH&T rates
        are 3.5 percent of the selling price for materiel with a unit price of $50,000 or
        less; plus 1.0 percent of the unit selling price over $50,000. (Column (4)(a) of the
        LOA will most likely have a unit cost reflected if this rule applies to the estimated
        price.)
        5.9.5.1.2.2. Transportation costs are the costs of DoD-provided or –financed
        transportation (land, air, inland and coastal waterways) in the US (for non-stock
        funded items) and outside the US and Overseas (OS) transportation by vessel or
        air (including parcel post via surface or air).
            5.9.5.1.2.2.1. These costs are not applicable to FMS customers who use
            commercial modes of transportation since this transportation is performed on
            Collect Commercial Bills of Lading (CCBL). However, all countries are
            authorized delivery within DTS by the most economical means. Accordingly,
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                            51


            LOAs which require use of the DTS (except for dedicated or premium
            transportation identified within the “Items to be Supplied” section of the
            LOA) will use look-up table rates for those items included in the table;
            otherwise, percentage surcharge rates may be applicable. The Transportation
            Cost Look-Up Table, published by DSCA, is based on rates determined by the
            services. Only items on the Look-Up Table qualify for the billing of
            estimated actual rates unless approval is received from DSCA with OSD(C)
            concurrence. The transportation costs are shown on line (11) of the LOA.
            5.9.5.1.2.2.2. With respect to procurements, the pricer needs to ensure that
            transportation costs are not being charged twice. Transportation costs will be
            assigned/computed via the DTC assigned to the FMS line. If contracts are
            written as Free On Board (FOB) destination, the line notes must detail the
            contractor transportation arrangements.
            5.9.5.1.2.2.3. When a Commercial Bill Of Lading (CBL) is used, it is
            annotated to show that normal commercial rates will be billed to the USG on
            behalf of the FMS purchaser.
            5.9.5.1.2.2.4. Transportation rates are assessed when the DTS is used for
            FMS materiel, when items are shipped on a CBL, and when packages are
            shipped prepaid through the US Postal Service (parcel post) (excluding WCF
            materiel). OSD(C) directs the computation and reporting of transportation
            costs based on the Delivery Term Code (DTC) included in the FMS case IPD;
            reference DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Appendix E and DLM 4000.25, Volume 6, ,
            Appendix 1.05. for a complete list of DTCs. If the items are shipped under
            conditions other than those of the DTC in the IPD, the charges will be based
            on the DTC that applies to the actual shipment. The SOS finance and
            accounting office will compute the transportation costs by applying the
            percentages presented in Table 5.3. example to the standard price of the items
            shipped (reference DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 5, Figure C5.F4.

                 5.9.5.1.2.2.5. Transportation cost will be computed using the Transportation

               arrangements will be made IAW DTR 4500.9-R; DSCA Manual 5105.38-M,
               Chapter 7; and AFMAN 16-101, Chapter 6.
        5.9.5.1.3. Administrative costs are added to all FMS cases to recover expenses of
        sales negotiations, case implementation, program control, computer programming,
        accounting and budgeting, and general administrative support of the FMS program.
        Administrative costs do not include the administration of FMS training cases at the
        installation level, since such charges are included in tuition rates. The estimated
        administrative expenses are on line (10) of the LOA.
            5.9.5.1.3.1. For rate details on standard administrative costs see DSCA Manual
            5105.38-M , Table C9.T4.
            5.9.5.1.3.2. The administrative costs include the following:
               5.9.5.1.3.2.1. Personnel costs based on a pro-rata share of those who spend 10
               percent or more of their time performing FMS duties.                Where an
               organization’s manpower staffing is based on routinely maintained workload
               statistics, such as number of requisitions processed, then FMS administrative
               personnel expense shall be determined from equivalent FMS workload
               statistics.
               5.9.5.1.3.2.2. TDY travel in support of FMS administrative functions.
               5.9.5.1.3.2.3. Automated data processing costs based on a pro-rata share of
               time to produce FMS reports or transactions.
               5.9.5.1.3.2.4. Printing costs (for FMS reports).
               5.9.5.1.3.2.5. Communications, utilities, and office supply costs.
               5.9.5.1.3.2.6. Office equipment costs.
               5.9.5.1.3.2.7. Rental charges for office space.
        5.9.5.1.4. The attrition charge is applicable to all training cases. An attrition rate of
        one percent for flying and non-flying training courses is included in tuition rates
        whenever the training or education course includes the use of operational equipment
        as training aids. Note: If another percentage is considered warranted, the Office of
        the DoD Comptroller (USD[C]) must approve a deviation.
     5.9.5.2. DoD policy requires that non-USG purchasers pay a fair price for the value of
     the DoD nonrecurring investment in the development and production of defense articles
     and/or the development of related technology. IAW DoDD 2140.2, recoupment of these
     costs is required on all cash sales unless a specific waiver has been processed. These
     charges are not applicable to FMS cases that are wholly financed with the MAP GA,
     and/or non-repayable FMS credit funds.
        5.9.5.2.1. Waiver requirements and authorities of nonrecurring costs on MDE for
        FMS requirements are contained in Public Law (PL) 104-106, 10 Feb 96, which
        amended Section 21(e) of the AECA.
54                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


        5.9.5.2.2. Nonrecurring charges are currently applicable to FMS sales of SME having
        a nonrecurring RDT&E cost of more than $50 million or a total production cost of
        more than $200 million regardless of the SOS. Each DoD component establishes a
        system to accumulate cost pools, to recognize when a cost pool meets the threshold,
        and to calculate the NC recoupment charge on a pro-rata basis for items or technology
        releasable for FMS. The NC recoupment charge computations for the sale of MDE
        items are submitted to the DSCA Director for approval. Refer to the DSCA Manual
        5105.38-M, Appendix 1 for a current listing of approved pro-rata charges.
        5.9.5.2.3. Applicable pro-rata charges are added to the unit and extended costs shown
        in position (4)(a) and (4)(b) of the LOA. When the price of an item being sold is
        reduced because of age, condition or supply status (excess), the same percentage
        reduction shall be applied to the pro-rata NC costs. Nonrecurring costs are not
        itemized or listed separately on either the LOA or the customer billing.
     5.9.5.3. After selecting the Indirect Pricing Components Tab, the user must complete the
     following:
        5.9.5.3.1. If an IPC needs to be applied, the pricer must first “add it” then select a
        Status of “AP” (Applied). If the Country Screen (Waivers Tab or Case Screen)
        Waivers Tab identifies a waiver for the IPC, the revised percent will be displayed in
        the Percent field and the amount waived will be displayed in the Waived Cost field.
        5.9.5.3.2. If a different percent needs to be applied to the IPC, select a Status of “OP”
        (Override Percent) and enter the revised percent.
        5.9.5.3.3. If an IPC needs to be applied, but the IPC Unit Cost needs to be revised,
        select a Status of “OC” (Override Cost), and enter the revised IPC Unit Cost.
        5.9.5.3.4. If an amount from the cost needs to be waived, enter a Status of “WC”
        (Waive Cost), and enter the amount that will be waived in the Waived Cost field. This
        value can be negative.
        5.9.5.3.5. The DSAMS system will automatically apply CAS waivers for the
        appropriate countries. The pricer should validate that the system has properly applied
        such waivers. The pricer will take care to not apply a waiver that the system has (or
        will) automatically generated and applied. This will lead to an incorrect charge.
        (Reference Attachment 2).
        5.9.5.3.6. If nothing needs to be done with the IPC, the Status will remain as “NA”
        (Not Applicable), and the IPC will not be applied to the requirement.
     5.9.5.4. The PA will internally verify the information provided and, if applicable,
     incorporate the necessary changes before reassigning it back to the IA. This step is
     completed IAW AFMAN 16-101, Chapter 4, to ensure quality line pricing.
     5.9.5.5. DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Financial Management Regulation, Security
     Assistance Policy and Procedures, will be used in verifying that the initial pricing data
     was entered correctly.
     5.9.5.6. Line Estimation data is coordinated and approved. First, information is passed
     along to management, which conducts another in-house verification of the pricing. If
     accurate and acceptable, management will approve the pricing. If the pricing has
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 55


       additional opportunities for improvement, management may re-task the pricer for
       changes. Second, if the pricing is done organically, the line pricing may be sent out to
       the FDO for additional approval.
          5.9.5.6.1. After the PA has successfully completed the pricing the line and getting
          internal coordination and approval, the tasking is returned to the IA (requestor).
          5.9.5.6.2. This step consists of saving the pricing information back into the DSAMS
          system as a completed task. The pricer highlights the task on the task list, selects
          “Tools/Complete,” adds any additional comments, then selects “Save.” These actions
          subsequently show the task as complete on the IA’s task list.
5.10. Responsibilities.
   5.10.1. AFSAC will:
       5.10.1.1. Determine the SOS responsible for materiel/services requested. If any of the
       items are identified as Army- or Navy-managed, send the request to that military service
       for action, and inform the FMS customer of the transfer. If any items are identified as
       DLA- or GSA-managed items, other than clothing, report the latest stock list price ; and
       standard CWTs (nine months for DLA and six months for GSA) in the LOAD estimate.
       If any of the items are identified as AFMC spares (SOS “F___,” Expendability,
       Recoverability, Reparability Category (ERRC) coded “N,” “P,” or “T” other than FSC
       1300), report the latest stock list price, and the CWT 3 to 12 months in the LOAD
       estimate. For system support stock fund items, include the appropriate additive charge.
       The following should be noted for sending materiel/services requests:
          5.10.1.1.1. CETS, see Chapter 9.
          5.10.1.1.2. Complete engines to appropriate AFLCMC engine manager at Tinker
          AFB.
          5.10.1.1.3. LOAD requests for transportation services are sent by the AFSAC case
          manager to the appropriate SOS.
          5.10.1.1.4. AFMETCAL, AFLCMC/WNMMI, 813 Irving-Wick Drive W. Bldg 2,

          5.10.1.1.8. Logistics management systems and/or the DLA Transaction Services to
          AFSAC Information Management Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433.
       5.10.1.2. Establish Suspense Dates. Usually, 30 days is allowed for processing of LOAD
       studies (including mailing time between HQ USAF and HQ AFMC). The SOS LOAD
       processing period for AF-negotiated cases will normally be 30 days. An interim reply
       will be sent if this date cannot be met. The only exception to this is a request marked
56                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


     “URGENT” in which case every effort will be made to speed up processing of the
     request (by message when the number of items being requested allows). Telephone
     LOAD requests will be used only in emergencies, and must be confirmed by follow-up
     message or letter.
     5.10.1.3. Prepare LOAD and send the request to the applicable SOS.
     5.10.1.4. Get LOAD from the SOS and other agencies as appropriate.

     5.10.2.2. Set up appropriate files and suspense date for reply to requesting office.
     5.10.2.3. Complete a preliminary review of the LOAD. Send non-prime items on the
     LOAD to the correct source of supply with an information copy to the requesting office.
     If sufficient information is not in the request to prepare the LOAD, the SOS will ask for
     additional information from the AFSAC case manager or directly from the FMS customer
     with an informational copy to the requesting office.
     5.10.2.4. Task the appropriate Program Management Office for action.               Maintain
     suspense control on all internal correspondence.
     5.10.2.5. Tell the requesting office, by message, if the Line Manager says the original
     assigned suspense date cannot be met; include the reason for the delay and recommend a
     new suspense date that can be met.
     5.10.2.6. Obtain the LOAD from the Line Manager and verify that the extended cost
     computations are correct.
     5.10.2.7. Complete all internal quality reviews for completeness and accuracy.
     5.10.2.8. Return LOAD estimate to the AFSAC office specified in the AFSAC request.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                     57

     5.10.3. The Line Manager will accomplish the following:
        5.10.3.1. Get the LOAD request from the SOS.
        5.10.3.2. Determine if the suspense date can be met, and if not, initiate action to extend
        the suspense immediately through the SOS to AFSAC.
        5.10.3.3. Provide LOAD for the substitute/replacement item if the initial requirement
        cannot be filled. State clearly on the LOAD that the NSN is a replacement/substitute
        item. Add clarifying comments if the item requested is not based on a valid NSN and
        there is a recommended substitute or replacement item.
        5.10.3.4. Ask for clarification from the FMS customer through the SOS if item
        identification or classification is not clear.
        5.10.3.5. If the AFSAC LOAD request states that the purchaser has requested sole
        source, the LOAD price should come from the contractor specified in the request.
        5.10.3.6. Make sure LOAD data are accurate and of high quality. The IMS’s immediate
        supervisor may also wish to review and initial the LOAD data and check list.

Section 5C—ADDITIONAL PRICING INSTRUCTIONS AND CASE FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT

5.11. FMS Materiel Pricing. The AF pricing policies for defense articles and services sold to
FMS customers are contained in DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Chapter 7.
   5.11.1. Stock Fund Deliveries of Non-excess Materiel.
       5.11.1.1. Non-excess stock-fund materiel shipped from depot stock or bought for direct
       delivery using stock-fund monies, are to be delivery reported to FMS customers at the
       published stock-fund price. The price to be charged is the catalog price at time of
       delivery. This guidance applies to both programmed and non-programmed requisitions.
       Stock fund items have a numeric budget code. Only secondary items are stock funded;
       principal/major items are not.
       5.11.1.2. Within the AF, stock fund materiel is managed within the Consolidated
       Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) of the AF WCF. FMS CSAG sales can be at
       standard price, exchange price, or Unserviceable Asset Price (UAP). The CSAG
       publishes a total of four prices and eight costs. AFH 23-123, Volume 1 describes these
       prices and costs and how they are applied to the FMS program.
       5.11.1.3. DLA also uses a stock-fund to manage and fund inventory. Unlike the AF, all
       DLA shipments will be stock-fund shipments. All DLA deliveries will be at the catalog
       standard price at time of delivery.
   5.11.2. Non-stock-Fund Deliveries of Non-excess Materiel.
       5.11.2.1. Non-stock Fund Secondary Item (ERCCs N, P, or T) Deliveries.
          5.11.2.1.1. Non-stock fund secondary items shipped from depot stock or bought for
          direct delivery using AF funds. There are two types of requisitions in this category.
          Repair and replace (H-coded) requisitions are to be delivery reported at exchange
          price (reference AFH 23-123, Volume 1). This price originates in D043 and is then
          directly fed to SAMIS. The condemnations percentage used is the current average
          CSAG Materiel Cost Recovery (MCR) percentage. Replenishment requisitions (non
          H-coded) are to be delivery reported to FMS customers at the published catalog
          standard price in effect at time of delivery. Non-stock fund items have an alpha
          budget code.
          5.11.2.1.2. Secondary items purchased via an AF-written FMS-funded (direct-cite)
          contract. These are to be delivery reported to FMS customers at the contract price.
          This guidance applies to both stock-fund items (numeric budget code) and non- stock-
          fund items procured via an FMS direct-cite-funded contract.
          5.11.2.1.3. Secondary items purchased/repaired via the Parts and Repair Ordering
          System (PROS). Materiel is to be delivery reported at a price based on the formula:
          the negotiated procurement or repair price + the contractor fill fee plus transportation
          cost and the PROS program fee.
 60                                                       AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       5.11.2.2. Principal/Major Item from Contract.
           5.11.2.2.1. Principal/major items purchased via an AF-written FMS-funded (direct-
           cite) contract are to be delivery reported at the contract price.
           5.11.2.2.2. Principal/major items purchased via PROS. Materiel is to be delivery
           reported at a price based on the formula: the negotiated procurement price + the
           contractor fill fee plus transportation cost and the PROS program fee.
       5.11.2.3. Principal/Major Item from Inventory. Principal or major items shipped from
       inventory will be reviewed by the IMS to determine if replacement is needed.
   5.11.3. Excess Materiel and Discount Price Sales.
       5.11.3.1. Pricing for the sale of excess materiel is described in DoD 7000.14-R, Volume
       15, Chapter 7.
       5.11.3.2. Exceptions to DoD 7000.14-R may occasionally be directed by DoD for the
       sale of materiel at a discount price. Pricing will be as directed by DoD.
5.12. Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG). Materiel/engines
removed as a result of either priority or routine reclamation may be used to support FMS
logistics requirements. At the time of removal, condition and final disposition of the item is
uncertain; AMARG costs for removal of materiel/engines which may support an FMS
requirement will vary and cannot be identified in advance. In most instances, these costs are fully
recouped by the USG since the materiel is sold at stock list price plus the administrative
surcharge.
5.13. Determination of GFM Cost for Contractor Shipments. For recovery of costs for
GFM, see DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Chapter 7.
5.14. Notification of Price Increases.
   5.14.1. Case financial management is necessary to control funds within the dollar limits of
   the approved case Obligation Authority (OA) and prevent an unfavorable financial condition.
   Case OA is issued by FY and may or may not equal case value. In either instance, when case
   deliveries and commitments exceed 100 percent of the approved case OA value, the case
   manager must get additional OA. If additional case value is available, the case manager
   submits a request for OA. If additional case value is not available, a US DoD Notice of
   Modification of Offer and Acceptance is necessary to increase the case to the needed dollar
   value. The additional case value should be enough to cover known and anticipated case
   requirements.
   5.14.2. Case Materiel/Services Prices:
       5.14.2.1. Case Materiel/Services Prices. Notification responsibility is not limited to
       those instances in which OA or case value is exceeded. Effective case management
       requires prices shown for materiel and services in the SAMIS to be as accurate and
       current as possible. Of special concern are items and services bought with FMS trust-
       fund money (direct cite).
       5.14.2.2. To keep current commitment prices for these procurements, the procedure of
       paragraph 5.14.2.3. below applies to all materiel and services cases and procurements
       using FMS direct-cite (“4F”) funds. The price update procedure below excludes:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 61


          5.14.2.2.1. Publications Cases.
          5.14.2.2.2. Method-of-report code “1” items (provisioning item order) on “S,” “D,”
          “Y,” and “Q” systems\ sales cases, but includes all other items on “S,” “D,” “Y,” and
          “Q” cases.
      5.14.2.3. Price Update Procedure:
          5.14.2.3.1. Services Cases. If the performance price will exceed the LOA quote, the
          approval of the AFSAC CCM must be obtained by message before contract award.
          5.14.2.3.2. Materiel Cases.
             5.14.2.3.2.1. If the item being bought is in the CSAG of the AF stock fund
             (budget code “1”), get AFSAC CCM approval when total item procurement cost
             (procurement unit price X quantity) exceeds extended stock list cost (stock list
             unit price X quantity) by more than 10 percent, and the increase is greater than
             $1,000.00.
             5.14.2.3.2.2. If the item is not a stock fund item (such as investment
             spares/equipment):
                 5.14.2.3.2.2.1. Send the AFSAC an “AE3” status card with “P1” status
                 showing the unit cost that was entered on the PR. The “AE3” status should be
                 sent to SAMIS by the DLA Transaction Services or directly input by the SOS.
                 This notification must be sent on all IMS initiated procurements of non-stock
                 fund items at the time the PR is submitted.
                 5.14.2.3.2.2.2. Get the AFSAC CM’s approval for price increases after PR
                 initiation and before contract award. Notification and approval are necessary
                 when the total item procurement cost exceeds the original procurement cost
                 (original PR unit price X quantity) by more than 25 percent, and the increase
                 is greater than $2,500. When the AFSAC CM’s approval is received by
                 message, submit another “P1” “AE3” status transaction (usually by DLA
                 Transaction Services) with the updated price.
                   5.14.2.3.2.2.2.1. For D/O cases, a LOAD is usually accomplished. The
                   estimated price is usually the last procurement price escalated to the
                   anticipated delivery date. This price will be on the LOA.
                   5.14.2.3.2.2.2.2. For B/O cases, a LOAD is not usually accomplished. As
                   with D/O cases, when the PR is submitted, the estimated price should be the
                   last procurement price escalated to the anticipated delivery date. It should
                   not be the stock list price only.
                 5.14.2.3.2.2.3. When an undefinitized contractual action is used, the IMS will
                 notify the CM of price increases when they are known.
5.15. Direct-Cite and Reimbursable Financing.
   5.15.1. For overall pricing information on direct-cite and reimbursable pricing policy, see
   DoD 7000.14- R, Volume 15.

   5.15.2. For estimating prices for direct-cite-, 4F-funded PR preparation, the IMS will use the
   same pricing techniques for FMS requirements as those used to compute FMS LOAD prices.
   Apply the formula and appropriate factors in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
   Factors, adjusted annually, to the last procurement price when arriving at amounts on PRS or
   contractual documents which use fund code “4F” trust fund resources.
5.16. Case Management Control System (CMCS). CMCS provides financial control and AF
OA for FMS cases IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15.

             FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) CASE PERFORMANCE

Section 6A—FM CASE IMPLEMENTATION

6.1. Purpose. This section provides guidance for processing FMS materiel requirements.
6.2. General.
   6.2.1. Purchasers may obtain materiel and services through FMS in one of three ways:
       6.2.1.1. D/O cases.
       6.2.1.2. B/O cases.
       6.2.1.3. CLSSAs allow for follow-on spares support and for the purchaser to stock
       prefunded requirements in the AF inventory. Each CLSSA program has two parts:
          6.2.1.3.1. The Foreign Military Sales Order I (FMSO I) is a stock-level case by
          which requirements are forecasted, funded, and stocked in the AF inventory.
          6.2.1.3.2. The FMSO II is an annual B/O case against which the CLSSA customer
          places requisitions. This case can be used to requisition items listed on the FMSO I
          and spares not listed.
   6.2.2. Each FMS case identifier is composed of three major components as specified in
   AFMAN 16-101 and DSCA Manual 5105.38-M.
   6.2.3. Billing of FMS customers is a function of DFAS.
6.3. FMS Case Types.
   6.3.1. FMS cases are set up by each military service for items and services for FMS
   customers. Case identifiers are used to help in the management, identification, accounting,
   and billing of FMS requirements.
   6.3.2. Correspondence on a specific customer's requirements should give the FMS case in
   the subject. The FMS customer and case are identified in MILSTRIP transactions in rp 31 –
   32 and 48-50 respectively. The first position of the case designator shows the commodity or
   service covered by the case (such as “A” for munitions). They are used to provide many
   types of materiel and services to foreign customers, for both initial and follow-on support
   requirements. A complete list of first-position case designators is listed in AFMAN 16-101,
   Attachment 3.
6.4. AFMC Implementation of FMS Cases.
   6.4.1. AFSAC will prepare an IPD for all system sales cases (D, S, Y, and Q cases) and D/O
   cases (A, G, H, M, N O, and P cases). B/O cases utilize country notifications in lieu of IPDs.
   These notifications provide the country with notification regarding when they can begin
   submitting orders against a case. The IPD will include both general and specific guidance to
   make sure all required actions of the FMS case are implemented as negotiated. This IPD will
   include a statement of OA issued by DFAS by Fiscal Year (FY) noting that the current year
   OA is not to be exceeded. The AFSAC will send the IPD to the SOS or other appropriate
 64                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   activity for action. The IPD is the command-guiding document and is to be followed by all
   recipients in the case implementation process.
6.5. Types of Support.
   6.5.1. Two basic types of support, initial and follow-on, are available to FMS customers.
   Some general characteristics of initial versus follow-on support programs for FMS customers
   are as follows:

Table 6.1. Type of Support
 Characteristics             Initial     Follow-On
 Number of Cases             Multiple    One (usually)
 Complex                     Yes         Occasionally
 Negotiated by               SAF         AFSAC
 Contractor(s) Interface     Extensive   Limited
   6.5.2. Initial Support.
       6.5.2.1. There are four FMS case designators that show initial support of system sales
       programs.
           6.5.2.1.1. “D” – CE system sales cases.
           6.5.2.1.2. “Q” – Consolidated sustainment support cases.
           6.5.2.1.3. “S” – Major Aircraft system sales cases.
           6.5.2.1.4. “Y” –Missile systems cases.
       6.5.2.2. For these programs there will be separate case/lines assigned within the basic
       LOA for the various parts of the program.
       6.5.2.3. System sales programs are usually complex, involve several MAJCOMs and
       contractors, and are often negotiated at high levels with early delivery dates which affect
       our ability to give the best logistics support.
   6.5.3. Follow-on support .
       6.5.3.1. There are many FMS cases for follow-on support programs which can be put
       into four groups.
           6.5.3.1.1. D/O materiel cases. For these cases the customer provides a definitized list
           of items. A line item pricing study is done by the IMS. These cases are managed on
           a line-item basis to watch over both price and delivery performance.
           6.5.3.1.2. D/O service cases. These cases have characteristics like D/O materiel
           cases (for example, a pricing study is done and the case is usually managed on a line
           item basis).
           6.5.3.1.3. B/O cases. These cases do not have definitized requirements, but are
           negotiated for a specific dollar value. The customer requisitions or orders the
           materiel/service. Usually these cases are for only one year and are replaced annually
           by another case.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    65


          6.5.3.1.4. CLSSA. The objective of the CLSSA program is to set follow-on support
          requirements so customers' financial investments can be used to ensure materiel is on
          hand or on order before actually entering a requisition in the AF supply system.
          Customers taking part in the CLSSA are treated as part of the AF supply system. The
          CLSSA program is made up of two cases, both having a “K” designator.
              6.5.3.1.4.1. “K” FMSO I. This case defines the customer's recurring spares
              requirements and is usually renegotiated every six months.
              6.5.3.1.4.2. “K” FMSO II. This case is setup on an annual basis to allow the
              customers to requisition spares and repair parts to support their weapon systems.

Section 6B—ACQUISITION FOR FMS

6.6. Sole-Source Acquisition of Items.
   6.6.1. Spares, spare parts, initial support, and follow-on support will be competitively
   purchased unless a sole-source purchase meets certain statutory exemptions and DSCA
   Manual 5105.38-M. However, FMS customers may request this type of acquisition in
   getting such support. Sole-source procedures for FMS customers to follow when requesting
   it and for DoD to follow during the review and approval phase of the request can be found in
   paragraph 5.7. of this manual. Subsequent to sole-source approval being granted and the
   LOA implemented, the following procedures are to be followed when procuring those
   materiel requirements identified in the LOA.
       6.6.1.1. Sole-source acquisition of materiel may be used to buy the following items: AF-
       managed Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA) and non-standard equipment items
       (including SE); reparable items where the AF is the PICA; reparable items where the AF
       is the Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA) (SOS RIC equals AF); or AF-
       managed (PICA) and non-standard consumable items.
       6.6.1.2. Sole-source acquisition cannot be used by the AF to buy the following items:
       equipment and reparable items managed by other services or agencies; and reparable
       items where the AF is the SICA, but the requisition is supported directly through the
       PICA (SOS RIC is other than AF); or consumable items managed by other services or
       agencies.
       6.6.1.3. Those requirements unsuitable for sole-source acquisition will be requisitioned
       through normal supply channels using established MILSTRIPs.
   6.6.2. Limitations and restrictions.
       6.6.2.1. Refer to paragraph 6.6.1.2 for a listing of those items authorized for sole-source
       acquisition and those items excluded from sole-source acquisition.
       6.6.2.2. Other service- or agency-managed items will not be bought directly by the AF
       through sole-source acquisition except when the AF is the SICA and the materiel
       requirements will be supported through the AF. Requirements for other service- or
       agency-managed items exempt from sole-source procurement are passed to the service or
       agency having item management responsibility either through a Military
       Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) or passing referral action (i.e., MILSTRIP).
       Requisitions for other services or agencies will be rejected and placed on Controlled
66                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


     Exception (CEX). Prior to releasing the CEX to the other service or agency, the
     AFLCMC Program Management Office (PMO) needs to ensure no internal contractual
     actions have begun. If contractual actions have been initiated, the AFLCMC PMO needs
     to ensure these actions are ceased immediately (providing termination charges do not
     apply). Subsequently, the AFLCMC PMO needs to release the requisition on CEX for
     support through normal DoD channels.
  6.6.3. Procedures. These procedures cover the different scenarios the FMS customer may
  have been authorized by the LOA for how the initial lay-in or follow-on support of spares
  and SE will be supported: SVI materiel is to be purchased directly from the prime and
  subcontractors (see paragraph 6.6.3.3); materiel provided is to be new and unused (see
  paragraph 6.6.3.4); materiel provided is to be supported through normal DoD supply
  channels when IM can supply the materiel within the RAD reflected on the LOA to include
  the procedures for how to handle the situations when normal supply channels cannot meet the
  RAD (see paragraph 6.6.3.5.); and support of part-numbered and non-standard items (see
  paragraph 6.6.3.6).
     6.6.3.1. During system definitization, the AFLCMC PMO, AFSAC command country or
     case manager, and the FMS customer representatives will list initial support
     requirements. The requisitions will be processed through the SAMIS using one or more
     of the options.
     6.6.3.2. Sole source requisitions can only be input to SAMIS on a case that includes
     authorization for sole-source procurement. This means the case must be associated and
     supported with an appropriate sole source authorization letter and LOA with the
     necessary terms, conditions, clauses, and annexes. In addition, if SVI is authorized for an
     FMS customer, then that authority must be explicitly stated in the LOA. Also, when SVI
     is used, the NSN, or manufacturer's part number with the FSC for manufacture for items
     requiring SVI, must be provided in the item list maintained in the case file but not part of
     the LOA.
     6.6.3.3. SVI: An FMS customer is granted authority for sole-source acquisition to
     ensure SVI so that the new item is the same as items already in the customer’s inventory,
     installed in the customer’s unique configurations, and kept in a specific way in the
     customer’s own shops. Follow the procedures beginning at paragraph 6.6.3.3.1. or
     6.6.3.3.2. when the FMS customer wants to ensure SVI.
         6.6.3.3.1. The SVI process can be accomplished through one of two methods.
         Method one is to be followed when the AFLCMC PMO prefers IM support
         requirements through normal procurement procedures by referencing, citing, and
         using the referenced contract. Method two is to be followed when the AFLCMC
         PMO decides to accomplish the procurement internally within the Weapon System
         PMO. Paragraph 6.6.1 lists those items that are authorized sole source acquisition
         and can be bought under SVI procedures and those items that are not authorized sole
         source acquisition and cannot be bought under SVI procedures.
         6.6.3.3.2. Method one:
            6.6.3.3.2.1. The AFLCMC PMO will ensure that an appropriate contracting
            instrument has been set up with the contractor designated in the LOA. Provisions
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                              67


          must be in the contract to allow not only the AF but also other services (i.e.,
          Army, Navy, etc.) to reference the contract when needed.
          6.6.3.3.2.2. The AFLCMC PMO will submit a sole source acquisition
          authorization letter to the IM having PICA or SICA item management
          responsibility and the requirements will be supported through the AF. The sole
          source acquisition authorization letter must reflect the designated contractor
          source, the Logistics Reference Number (LRN) and Commercial And
          Government Entity (CAGE) code of the contractor, the country and activity code
          (see DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.18. for list), and the case designator.
          6.6.3.3.2.3. The authorization to buy items sole source directly by the AF applies
          to those items listed in paragraph 6.6.1. The AF SICA IM for other services’ or
          agencies’ reparable items will forward requirements to the managing service via a
          MIPR. The MIPR must include all contract information to facilitate the
          acquisition (see AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1, Item Manager Wholesale
          Requisition Process [D035A] when published).
          6.6.3.3.2.4. The AFLCMC PMO will submit requisitions as follows:
             6.6.3.3.2.4.1. Requisitions for AF or other service- or agency-managed items
             for reparable items where the SICA is AF are input with “6V” and process
             code “D.” These requisitions will generate a “6V” exception to the PICA or
             SICA IM. See DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.15.for a complete list of advice
             codes.
             6.6.3.3.2.4.2. Requisitions for other service-managed or agency-managed
             items are input using normal MILSTRIP procedures. These requirements will
             be supported through normal channels. SAMIS will have edits in place to
             ensure compliance. SAMIS will reject requirements on CEX that are not in
             compliance. Before releasing the CEX to the other service/agency, the PMO
             needs to ensure no internal contractual actions have begun. If contractual
             actions have been initiated, the AFLCMC PMO needs to ensure these actions
             are ceased immediately (providing termination charges do not apply).
             Subsequently, the AFLCMC PMO needs to release the CEX for support
             through normal DoD channels.
          6.6.3.3.2.5. The IM will upon receipt of the “6V” exception:
             6.6.3.3.2.5.1. Obtain the sole source-acquisition authorization letter and
             initiate procurement action as directed by instructions in the letter.
             6.6.3.3.2.5.2. The IM will prepare the PR and forward the PR package to
             contracting or prepare the MIPR and forward the MIPR package to the other
             service/agency PICA IM. For a PR, the AF PICA IM will ensure a record is
             established in the Acquisition Asset Due-In System (J041) and record the
             “BV” status in the Stock Control System, Item Manager Wholesale
             Requisition Process (D035A). For a MIPR, the AF SICA IM will record the
             BV status in the D035A and follow up for procurement status on the MIPR
             with the PICA IM and ensure the shipment and billing data is received and
             processed in the D035A and SAMIS.
68                                                 AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


     6.6.3.3.3. Method two:
        6.6.3.3.3.1. The AFLCMC PMO will make sure an appropriate contracting
        instrument has been established with the contractor designated in the LOA. In
        addition, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) will need to be executed among
        AFLCMC/WFS, AFLCMC PMO, SAPM, HQ AFMC/A4, the FMS customer,
        and any other parties deemed appropriate by the AFLCMC PMO.
        6.6.3.3.3.2. The authorization to buy items sole-source by or through the AF
        applies to AF-managed and SICA items. Other service/agency items must be
        requisitioned using normal supply procedures.
        6.6.3.3.3.3. The AFLCMC PMO will:
            6.6.3.3.3.3.1. Provide a list of required items by electronic media to
            AFLCMC/WFS to process the definitized requirements in SAMIS or
            manually input the requirements into SAMIS. If the ERRC of the item is S, T,
            or U, and the SOS/RIC is AF, the AFLCMC PMO will request SAMIS
            process the requisition with advice code of “BV” and a process code of “S,”
            overlay “SVIC” in rp 77-80, and pass it to the SOS or manually process the
            requisition with advice code of “BV” and a process code of “S.” If the ERRC
            is other than S, T, or U, the AFLCMC PMO will request SAMIS process the
            requisition with advice code of “2J” indicating fill or kill and pass it to D035A
            or manually process the requisition with advice code “2J.” Upon receipt of an
            AE transaction with requisition transaction status code of “CB” by SAMIS,
            the AFLCMC PMO will submit/ generate a new requisition with “BV” advice
            code, “S” process code, and overlay “SVIC” in rp 77-80.
            6.6.3.3.3.3.2. Requisitions for other service/agencies managed items are input
            using normal MILSTRIP procedures. These requirements will be supported
            through normal channels. SAMIS will have edits in place to ensure
            compliance. SAMIS will reject requirements on CEX that are not in
            compliance. Before releasing the CEX to the other service/agency, the
            AFLCMC PMO needs to ensure no internal contractual actions have begun. If
            contractual actions have been initiated, the AFLCMC PMO needs to ensure
            these actions are ceased immediately (providing termination charges don’t
            apply). Subsequently, the AFLCMC PMO needs to release the CEX for
            support through normal DoD channels.
            6.6.3.3.3.3.3. Research/resubmit rejections.
            6.6.3.3.3.3.4. Prepare a PR for AF PICA and SICA items and ensure that the
            PR is established in J041. The PR must cite type PR code “61” to allow the
            passing of non-prime items to J041 at the SOS.
            6.6.3.3.3.3.5. For AF-managed items and AF SICA items, ensure shipment
            and billing information is received and appropriately processed in J041,
            SAMIS, and D035A.
            6.6.3.3.3.3.6. Normally, the IM will not act on back orders. If necessary, the
            AFLCMC PMO or SAPM will request assistance from the IM to take manual
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                69


               action on the requisitions when problems can only be resolved through
               assistance by the IM. The AFLCMC PMO is responsible for contacting the
               IM to take necessary action.
           6.6.3.3.3.4. AFLCMC/WFS will:
               6.6.3.3.3.4.1. Screen the NSNs against the catalog contained in SAMIS to
               determine the DoD SOS.
               6.6.3.3.3.4.2. Provide rejects to the AFLCMC PMO for research and
               resubmission.
               6.6.3.3.3.4.3. If the SAMIS catalog reveals the SOS/RIC is other
               services/agencies and the materiel will be supplied through the AF, SAMIS
               will assign the requisition number and reject the requisition to the AFLCMC
               PMO. The rejected transaction will include the appropriate service/agency in
               the RIC and will reflect a “2L” advice code.
               6.6.3.3.3.4.4. If the SAMIS catalog indicates the SOS/RIC is the AF, SAMIS
               will generate a requisition with advice of “BV” and a process code of “S;”
               overlay “SVIC” in rp 77-80; and pass it to D035A.
           6.6.3.3.3.5. D035A under program control will:
               6.6.3.3.3.5.1. Check inventory records to see if stock exists (for requisitions
               with an advice code of “2J”). If stock is available, D035A will process a drop
               from inventory transaction so the materiel will ship. If no inventory is
               available, D035A will provide an AE transaction to SAMIS with “CB” status
               killing or, in effect, canceling the requisition.
               6.6.3.3.3.5.2. For requisitions with advice code “BV,” process code of “S,”
               and “SVIC” in rp 77-80, D035A will automatically establish a BV back order.
           6.6.3.3.3.6. IM will:
               6.6.3.3.3.6.1. Assist the AFLCMC PMO or SAPM to resolve all SVI
               requisitioning issues if requested.
     6.6.3.4. New and Unused Process:
        6.6.3.4.1. When the FMS customer has stated that sole-source acquisition is
        authorized and new and unused materiel is to be supplied, then initial lay-in
        procedures stated in paragraph 6.6.3.3, and either 6.6.3.3.2 (SVI method one) or
        6.6.3.3.3. (SVI method two) can be utilized.
        6.6.3.4.2. In addition, when sole source authorization is included or added to a
        follow-on support case and new and unused is to be supplied, the procedures
        contained in paragraph 6.6.3.3. (method one) are applicable with the following
        modifications. Method two procedures cannot be used.
           6.6.3.4.2.1. In paragraph 6.6.3.3.2.1, the AFLCMC PMO needs to be replaced
           with the AFSAC case manager.            The AFSAC case manager will use
           AFLCMC/WFG to select or establish a contracting instrument and ensure a copy
           of the contract is provided to the IM.
 70                                                         AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


               6.6.3.4.2.2. In paragraph 6.6.3.3.2.2, the AFLCMC PMO needs to be replaced
               with AFSAC case manager. The AFSAC case manager must provide the 430
               SCMS with the requisite sole-source letter containing the designated contractor
               source, the LRN, CAGE, country and activity code, and the case designator.
6.6.3.4.2.3. Paragraph 6.6.3.3.2.3. requires no changes. However, the IM should be informed
the contract information originated from a contract that was not negotiated at the SOS.

6.6.3.4.2.4. Paragraphs 6.6.3.3.2.4. and 6.6.3.3.2.4.2., the AFLCMC PMO needs to be replaced
with AFSAC case manager.

6.6.3.4.2.5. Paragraphs 6.6.3.3.2.4.1., 6.6.3.3.2.5., 6.6.3.3.2.5.1., and 6.6.3.3.2.5.2. require no
changes. However, AFLCMC/WFG must ensure that the case manager is provided with
procurement status and shipping information. The AFSAC case manager must ensure the
shipping status is provided to the prime IM. The IM must ensure the shipping information is
overlaid in J041 and D035A.

       6.6.3.5. Support provided through normal supply channels.
           6.6.3.5.1. Initial support procedures. When an FMS customer authorizes the use of
           sole source acquisition to get items shown in initial activation cases for which the
           RAD cannot be met through normal supply or acquisition channels, the following
           procedures will apply:
               6.6.3.5.1.1. The AFLCMC PMO will make sure a contract exists with the prime
               contractor (as designated in the LOA). Provisions must be included in the
               contract to allow not only the AF, but other services/agencies (i.e., Army, Navy,
               etc.) to reference this contract to acquire items when needed. The contract can
               then be used by the IMs of all services to obtain items that cannot be supplied
               within the RAD through normal supply or acquisition channels.
               6.6.3.5.1.2. The AFLCMC PMO will submit a Sole Source Acquisition
               Authorization Letter (SSAL) to the 430 SCMS for reparables that will be
               supported through the AF. The SSAL must reflect the designated contractor
               source, the LRN, and the contractor CAGE code, the country and activity code,
               and the case designator. Additionally, the following statement will be addressed:
                   6.6.3.5.1.2.1. Item(s) associated with the case will be supplied through
                   normal supply or acquisition channels, if such methods permit delivery of the
                   item(s) within the RAD.
               6.6.3.5.1.3. The authorization to buy items sole source directly by the AF applies
               to those items listed in paragraph 6.6.1
               6.6.3.5.1.4. Items for which the AF is the PICA, and which cannot be provided
               through normal supply or acquisition channels within the RAD, may be purchased
               by the IM sole source through the prime contractor by referencing the contract
               number.
               6.6.3.5.1.5. Requirements for other-service-managed items, where the AF is the
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                               71


          SICA, are sent to the managing service on a reimbursement-funded requisition
          when the item can be supplied by the PICA within the RAD. If the managing
          service cannot provide the item within the RAD through normal supply or
          purchase channels, the use of a MIPR is needed. The MIPR will contain all
          applicable contract information to facilitate the purchase process for the PICA IM.
          (See AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 5 when published.)
          6.6.3.5.1.6. The AFLCMC PMO will submit requisitions with advice code “6W”
          and process code “D.”
             6.6.3.5.1.6.1. Requisitions for AF-managed items, and AF SICA items for
             which the requirements will be supported through the AF, are input with
             advice code “6W” and process code “D.” This allows requisitions to fill
             automatically from stock above the control level. If stock is below the control
             level, a “6V” exception is sent to the IM.
             6.6.3.5.1.6.2. Requisitions for other service-managed or agency-managed
             items are input using normal MILSTRIP procedures. These requirements will
             be supported through normal channels. SAMIS will have edits in place to
             ensure compliance. SAMIS will reject requirements on a CEX that are not in
             compliance. Before releasing the CEX to the other service/agency, the
             AFLCMC needs to ensure that no internal contractual actions have begun. If
             contractual actions have been initiated, the AFLCMC needs to ensure these
             actions are ceased immediately (providing termination charges do not apply).
             Subsequently, the AFLCMC needs to release the CEX for support through
             normal DoD channels.
          6.6.3.5.1.7. The contract information included in the MIPR package may come
          from a contract that was not negotiated at the SOS. The IM will, upon receipt of
          the “6V” exception:
             6.6.3.5.1.7.1. Procure AF-managed items through normal supply or
             acquisition channels if the item can be provided by the RAD.
             6.6.3.5.1.7.2. Prepare a PR, including the sole source acquisition request, and
             send it to contracting, citing the contract in the SSAL, if normal supply or
             acquisition channels will not allow AF-managed items to be provided within
             the RAD. Furnish the information to contracting, ensure a record is
             established in J041, and process the BV in D035A, etc.
             6.6.3.5.1.7.3. For items with an AF SICA but which are requisitioned through
             the PICA, the IM will contact the other service or agency IM to determine the
             type of document (reimbursable-funded requisition or MIPR) needed to
             acquire the item within the RAD. If a MIPR is requested by the managing
             service or agency, include the applicable contract information on the MIPR
             for the PICA IM to cite in procuring and satisfying the requirement. (See
             AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1 when published.)
             6.6.3.5.1.7.4. The IM will prepare the MIPR, furnish the information to the
             PICA IM, ensure status is updated in the D035A system, etc.
72                                                AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


     6.6.3.5.2. Follow-on Support Procedures. When an FMS customer authorizes the use
     of sole source acquisition to ensure items are received within the RAD, the following
     procedures will apply:
        6.6.3.5.2.1. The AFSAC case manager will make sure a contract exists with the
        prime contractor (as designated in the LOA). Provisions must include allowance
        for not only the AF, but other services/agencies (i.e., Army, Navy, etc.) to
        reference this contract to acquire items when needed. The contract can then be
        used by the IMs of all services to obtain items that cannot be supplied within the
        RAD through normal supply or acquisition channels. The AFSAC case manager
        will use AFLCMC/WFG to select or establish the contract and to ensure that a
        copy is provided to the IM.
        6.6.3.5.2.2. The AFSAC case manager will submit a SSAL to the 430 SCMS for
        reparables that will be supported through the AF. The SSAL must reflect the
        designated contractor source, the LRN, and the contractor CAGE code, the
        country and activity code, and the case designator. The AFSAC case manager
        must provide the 430 SCMS with the requisite sole source letter containing the
        designated contractor source, LRN, CAGE, country and activity code, and case
        designator. Additionally, the following statement will be addressed:
            6.6.3.5.2.2.1. Item(s) associated with the case will be supplied through
            normal supply or acquisition channels, if such methods permit delivery of the
            item(s) within the RAD.
        6.6.3.5.2.3. The authorization to buy items sole-source directly by the AF applies
        to those items listed in paragraph 6.6.1
        6.6.3.5.2.4. Items for which the AF is the PICA, and which cannot be provided
        through normal supply or acquisition channels within the RAD, may be purchased
        by the IM sole source through the prime contractor by referencing the contract
        number.
        6.6.3.5.2.5. Requirements for other-service-managed items, where the AF is the
        SICA, are sent to the managing service on a reimbursement-funded requisition
        when the item can be supplied by the PICA within the RAD. If the managing
        service cannot provide the item within the RAD through normal supply or
        purchase channels, the use of a MIPR is needed. The MIPR will contain all
        applicable contract information to facilitate the purchase process for the PICA IM.
        (See AFMCMAN 23-5 when published.)
        6.6.3.5.2.6. The AFSAC case manager will submit requisitions with advice code
        “6W” and process code “D.”
            6.6.3.5.2.6.1. Requisitions for AF-managed items, and AF SICA items for
            which the requirements will be supported through the AF, are input with
            advice code “6W” and process code “D.” This allows requisitions to fill
            automatically from stock above the control level. If stock is below the control
            level, a “6V” exception is sent to the IM.
            6.6.3.5.2.6.2. Requisitions for other service-managed or agency-managed
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 73


                items are input using normal MILSTRIP procedures. These requirements will
                be supported through normal channels. SAMIS will have edits in place to
                ensure compliance. SAMIS will reject requirements on a CEX that are not in
                compliance. Before releasing the CEX to the other service/agency, the
                AFLCMC PMO needs to ensure that no internal contractual actions have
                begun. If contractual actions have been initiated, the AFLCMC PMO needs to
                ensure these actions are ceased immediately (providing termination charges
                do not apply). Subsequently, the AFLCMC PMO needs to release the CEX
                for support through normal DoD channels.
            6.6.3.5.2.7. The IM will, upon receipt of the “6V” exception:
                6.6.3.5.2.7.1. Procure AF-managed items through normal supply or
                acquisition channels if the item can be provided by the RAD.
                6.6.3.5.2.7.2. Prepare a PR, including the sole source acquisition request, and
                send it to contracting, citing the contract in the SSAL, if normal supply or
                acquisition channels will not allow AF-managed items to be provided within
                the RAD. Furnish the information to contracting, ensure a record is
                established in J041, and process the BV in D035A, etc.
                6.6.3.5.2.7.3. For items with an AF SICA but which are requisitioned through
                the PICA, the IM will contact the other service or agency IM to determine the
                type of document (reimbursable-funded requisition or MIPR) needed to
                acquire the item within the RAD. If a MIPR is requested by the managing
                service or agency, include the applicable contract information on the MIPR
                for the PICA IM to cite in procuring and satisfying the requirement. (See
                AFMCMAN 23-5 when published.)
                6.6.3.5.2.7.4. The AFSAC case manager must ensure the shipping status is
                passed to the prime IM. The IM then ensures the status is overlaid into the
                D035A. The IM will also prepare the MIPR and furnish the information to
                the PICA IM, etc.
     6.6.3.6. Non-standard Item Support Process: When an FMS customer's authorization of
     sole source acquisition has non-standard items or part-numbered items that are not cross-
     referenced to an NSN, the following procedures will apply. Note: This process
     encompasses all of the scenarios outlined above.
        6.6.3.6.1. The AFLCMC PMO on initial activation cases and the AFSAC case
        manager for follow-on support cases will interrogate D043 and DLA Logistics
        Information Service total item record to determine if NSNs or NC (temporary stock
        number) management control numbers have already been established for the desired
        part numbers.
        6.6.3.6.2. The AFLCMC PMO on initial activation cases may either submit the part
        numbered requisition through SAMIS to the AFSAC’s non-standard contractor or
        initiate cataloging action to have a “NC” stock number assigned. “ND” number
        assignment will not be accomplished.
 74                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


          6.6.3.6.3. The AFLCMC PMO on initial activation cases will follow the procedures
          outlined in paragraph 6.6.3, option 1, 2, or 3 when requisitioning either non-standard
          NSNs or “NC” stock numbered items. Part-numbered requisitions will be processed
          through the AFSAC non-standard support contractor IAW these instructions:
              6.6.3.6.3.1. The AFSAC case manager for follow-on support cases will establish
              DCNs to requisition the desired item with the LRN and CAGE.
              6.6.3.6.3.2. The AFSAC case manager for follow-on support cases will check
              that all LRN requests with no record of an NSN or “NC” number are submitted to
              SAMIS as part-numbered requisitions and passed to the AFSAC’s non-standard
              contractor.
              6.6.3.6.3.3. The AFSAC case manager will submit the SSAL to the AFSAC non-
              standard support contractor. The SSAL must specify the guidelines that the
              contractor is to follow in supporting the materiel requirements.
6.7. Special Purchase Requirements.
   6.7.1. Local purchase (LP)/LM and commercial-type items. LP/LM or commercial-type
   items are bought from local or common commercial sources. Usually, these items are not
   authorized for sale through FMS channels. However, LP/LM items may be bought through
   FMS cases, if items cannot be found in the requesting country. Specific supply groups and
   FSCs of commercial-type items are in the DSCA Manual 5105.38-M.
      6.7.1.1. For D/O cases, the FMS customer must state on the pricing study the items or
      services which are not available from in-country commercial sources.
      6.7.1.2. On B/O cases, a customer-prepared requisition with advice code “3B” or “2A” is
      the customer's claim that the item is not available from in-country commercial sources.
      Advice code “3B” is used for commercial-type items. Advice code “2A” is used for
      LP/LM items.
      6.7.1.3. Regardless of the type of case, AFSAC should transfer all cases with SAMIS
      commercial consumable code “7” (defined as ineligible for LP/LM/commercial-type
      requisitions) to D035A. D035A edits all LP/LM or commercial-type item requisitions
      and rejects them if advice codes “3B” or “2A” haven't been used. On D/O cases, the case
      manager is responsible for using the correct advice code.
   6.7.2. First Article Testing (FAT) will be funded as follows.
      6.7.2.1. For a combined AF/FMS buy.
          6.7.2.1.1. CSAG. For a combined AF/FMS buy using CSAG OA, the CSAG will
          pay for the first article item, report, and testing. The approved first article item will
          be placed in AF stock, if not destroyed in testing. CSAG costs are automatically pro-
          rated to all customers through the CSAG Operational Cost Recovery elements. No
          special action is required.
          6.7.2.1.2. Non-CSAG. For a combined AF/FMS buy, informational sublines will be
          used on the contract to prorate the contractor first article costs.
              6.7.2.1.2.1. If the first article item is to be destroyed in testing, the contractor
              FAT costs are to be prorated among the AF and the FMS customers. The prorate
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                       75


             is based on the quantity of materiel ordered and defined in the PR and on the
             contract.
             6.7.2.1.2.2. If the first article item is not to be destroyed in testing, the AF portion
             of the prorate will include the item cost plus part of the other contractor FAT cost.
             The FMS portion will not include the item cost. Upon completion of the test, the
             first article item will be placed in AF stock.
             6.7.2.1.2.3. Using the contract information, the SOS will bill accordingly. The
             billing against the FMS case should be identified as “FAT costs.”
     6.7.2.2. For a single-country FMS buy using FMS funds, case funds will be used to pay
     for the contractor FAT costs. The approved first-article item will be returned to the
     contractor, if not destroyed in testing, for shipment with the production items direct to the
     customer.
  6.7.3. For a multiple-country FMS buy using FMS funds, information sublines will be used
  on the contract to prorate the contractor FAT costs.
     6.7.3.1. If the first-article item is to be destroyed in testing, the contractor FAT costs are
     to be prorated among all the FMS customers. The prorate is based on the quantity of
     materiel ordered and defined in the PR and on the contract.
     6.7.3.2. If the first-article item is not to be destroyed in testing, the item costs are not to
     be prorated, but the other contract FAT costs are. Upon completion of the test, the first
     article item is to be returned to the contractor for shipment with the production items to
     the FMS customers.
     6.7.3.3. Using the contract information, the DFAS operating location will bill
     accordingly. The billing against the FMS case should be identified as “FAT costs.”
  6.7.4. FAT costs include the item cost (if destroyed in testing), the actual testing costs, and
  the test report cost. In the paragraphs above, the term “contractor FAT costs” refers to those
  FAT cost elements that are included in the contract. If the AF does the actual testing, it will
  not be included in the contract. If the AF does the testing and the testing costs can be
  identified, they should be prorated to the FMS customers accordingly.
  6.7.5. To ensure that sufficient case funds are available, the initial pricing of the item to the
  FMS customer must include all costs, including FAT. If required, normal price increase
  approval procedures apply.
  6.7.6. If FAT is required, and an AF-funded buy is scheduled in the near future, the AFSAC
  case manager will be queried by the IM as to whether a separate FMS-funded buy should be
  pursued. Consolidating the buys could save money for both the AF and the FMS customer.
  6.7.7. The IM should identify the need to prorate FAT costs by placing the statement
  “Prorate any First-Article Costs” in the “Note to Buyer” section of an automated PR, or block
  12 of a manual PR.
  6.7.8. The contract must have provisions for transportation to and from the testing facility,
  which are to be the responsibility of the contractor.
  6.7.9. All situations involving the first-article process are not covered here.            Unique
  situations must be handled appropriately as they occur.

Section 6C—PROCESSING FMS REQUISITIONS

6.8. Overview.
   6.8.1. This section provides guidance for processing FMS requisitions. These procedures
   supplement DLM 4000.25-1 requirements. These procedures do not apply to the types of
   materiel identified paragraph C1.4., Exclusions
   6.8.2. Types of FMS requisitions:
      6.8.2.1. Repair and replace (H-coded) requisitions.
          6.8.2.1.1. These are commonly referred to as H-coded requisitions because they
          contain an “H” in the first position of the document serial number (e.g.,
          DUT0445365H001).
          6.8.2.1.2. SAMIS creates H-coded requisitions when the FMS customer returns an
          unserviceable carcass to the SOS under the repair/replace program.
      6.8.2.2. Non-repair/replace (non H-coded) requisitions.
          6.8.2.2.1. These are normal requisitions for serviceable items. These requisitions are
          submitted to establish initial operating stocks, and to replace operating stocks that are
          condemned when no longer serviceable or reparable.
          6.8.2.2.2. These requisitions are called non H-coded requisitions to distinguish them
          from H-coded requisitions. They have an all numeric document serial number (i.e.,
          DUT04453610002).
   6.8.3. FMS requisitions can be programmed or non-programmed.
      6.8.3.1. Requisitions for items/quantities that have been forecast on the CLSSA FMSO I
      case are programmed, that is, eligible for support from on-hand/on-order stocks based on
      the priority of the requisition.
      6.8.3.2. Requisitions for items/quantities that have not been forecast on the CLSSA
      FMSO I case are non-programmed, that is, eligible for support lead time away.
   6.8.4. The following combinations are possible:
      6.8.4.1. Programmed H-coded requisition.
      6.8.4.2. Non-programmed H-coded requisition.
      6.8.4.3. Programmed non H-coded requisition.
      6.8.4.4. Non-programmed non H-coded requisition.
6.9. Defined Order Case Requisition Processing.
   6.9.1. D/O cases are requested by the FMS customer to buy specified quantities of specific
   items. These cases are written and implemented by the AFSAC and are assigned to a case
   manager in the AFSAC.
   6.9.2. Requisitions are input to the SAMIS by the AFSAC case manager/supply technician,
   or the AFLCMC case line manager for D/O cases, in MILSTRIP or custom order format as
   shown in Attachment 3.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    77


   6.9.3. The following products will be output from SAMIS:
      6.9.3.1. The referral orders (“A4”) and passing orders (“A3”) are made up and sent
      according to the criteria set up by the process code.
      6.9.3.2. AFSAC sends a “BU” or “BW” status, which acts as a duplicate of the
      requisition input, to the FMS customer's representative.
      6.9.3.3. The supply and shipment status reports/documents are sent to the FMS Customer
      Representative (CR)/FF address (from the FF code [rp 47]) set up in the LOA and case
      directive. This is identified by the media and status code (rp 7). The FMS CR/FF
      addresses to which supply and shipment status reports/documents are sent are shown in
      the MAPAD, by FF code, under Type of Address Code (TAC) “4.”
      6.9.3.4. “BU,” “BW,” “BM,” and other requisition transaction status codes give the FMS
      CR the capability of relating supply/shipment status to the case and item, and should be
      used to monitor the FMS case through supply completion. The “BU” code gives the first
      input to the FMS customer master due-in records.
   6.9.4. SAMIS validates requisitions before passing them to the supply point.
6.10. Preparation and Processing of Requisitions Against Follow-on “E” and B/O Cases.
   6.10.1. “E” cases are set up to order support-equipment-related supply items of US origin
   that are frequently used by the customer. A B/O case sets up a dollar value for buying items
   that may be needed during the case requisitioning period. The requisition period is usually
   for one year with a maximum of two years.
   6.10.2. “R” cases are set up to order spare parts of US origin. This case sets the dollar value
   for items that the customer requisitions for the period of the case (usually one year, with a
   maximum of two years). As a rule, only one “R” case is needed for each customer.
   6.10.3. Requisitions for “E” and “R” cases are input by the FMS customers and must be in
   MILSTRIP format per DLM 4000.25-1Items requisitioned under these procedures are
   usually from AF catalogs, technical orders, parts listings, and other publications associated
   with the end item. These publications are used to get stock number data. Requests for SOS
   identification help are sent to the AFSAC. The FMS customers (or the AFSAC) requisition a
   quantity of materiel that has a minimum value of $10 per line item. This procedure is
   necessary because of the cost of processing and shipping low-dollar-value items. These
   cases will not be used to supply items to contractors or commercial agents involved in direct
   contracts unless they were set up as a representative of the customer and were approved by
   SAF/IA.
   6.10.4. The AFSAC case managers will negotiate the LOAs and set up the appropriate types
   of cases. These cases have the following characteristics:
      6.10.4.1. Each case is usually for one year, but may be for as long as two years, and set
      up according to the customer's fiscal or calendar year.
      6.10.4.2. The first digit of the case designator is “E” or “R” for these cases.
      6.10.4.3. Priority designators are given by the requisitioners using the Force or Activity
      Designator (F/AD) related to the Urgency of Need Designator (UND) (reference DLM
      4000.25-1, Appendix 2.14, Table 1). The F/AD is found in the LOA. Depending on
 78                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      F/AD assigned, FMS NMCS requisitions must always be priority f 3, f 7, or f 8. Priority
      designators are in rp 60-61 and must be numeric. If left blank, SAMIS will force a
      priority 15.
      6.10.4.4. Each case has an estimated cash dollar value for control purposes. The dollar
      value can be adjusted as necessary.
      6.10.4.5. Requisitions are usually filled or stay on back order until filled, except when
      advice code “2C” causes the requisition to either be filled by the Required Delivery Date
      (RDD) or be cancelled (referred to as “fill or kill”).
   6.10.5. Requisitions are sent by mail, DLA Transaction Services, message traffic, or other
   means. The rules for submitting requisitions and preparing messages in DLM 4000.25-1,
   paragraph 3.25 apply to FMS requisitioning.
   6.10.6. Requisitions are sent by mail via disc format or transmitted via E-mail. Postal
   mailings are addressed as follows: AFSAC, 1822 Van Patton Drive, Wright Patterson AFB
   OH 45433-5337. Containers/envelopes will be marked, “FMS MILSTRIP Requisitions.”
   6.10.7. Customer initiated requisitions will go through initial processing by SAMIS. Initial
   processing includes editing, validating, pricing, and recording the commitment in the case
   master record.
   6.10.8. Requisitions are released by SAMIS through referral orders to the IM. SAMIS sends
   requisitions for items managed by DLA/GSA to the appropriate DLA/GSA activity for
   supply action.
   6.10.9. Upon release of the referral-/passing-order, SAMIS will send the supply status (code
   “BW”) to the appropriate recipient as designated in the MAPAD.
   6.10.10. AFSAC monitors the FMS B/O requisition case(s), and is responsible for the
   following related actions:
      6.10.10.1. Acting as point of contact for authorized foreign government representatives
      for processing requisition type cases.
      6.10.10.2. Setting up and keeping the case administrative file during the active life of the
      case. The file will contain copies of all correspondence and reports related to the case.
      6.10.10.3. Informing the SOS(s) of the case termination date to ensure proper and timely
      closing of cases.
   6.10.11. Customer requisitions are prepared on DD Form 1348 or 1348M, Single Line Item
   Requisition System Document, DoD (Mechanical), or other means IAW DLM 4000.25-1,
   paragraph 3.25. See Attachment 3.
6.11. Submission of Requisitions, Follow-ups, Cancellations, and Requisition Modifiers.
   6.11.1. The following countries may route all generated MILSTRIP traffic to the proper
   DLA Transaction Services station shown below for processing:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                              79


Table 6.2. DLA Transaction Services Stations
 Country              Station
 Australia            Tracy
 Belgium              Dayton
 Canada               Dayton
 Denmark              Dayton
 Germany              Dayton
 Greece               Dayton
 NATO                 Dayton
 Netherlands          Dayton
 Norway               Dayton
 Philippines          Tracy
 South Korea          Tracy
 Taiwan               Tracy
 Thailand             Tracy
 United Kingdom Dayton
 Note: DLA Transaction Services
 routine indicator for Tracy is
 “RUWJZZA” and for Dayton the
 routing indicator is “RUEDZZA.”

      6.11.1.1. MILSTRIP transactions for DLA Transaction Services processing will always
      have a constant content-indicator code of “IAZZ.”
      6.11.1.2. DLA Transaction Services has a program which is used to process SAP
      transactions and route requisitions directly to SAMIS by inserting “FNH” in rp 4-6.
      Without this program, DLA Transaction Services will merely pass these transactions to
      the RIC entered by the originator. DLM 4000.25-1 mandates all FMS requisitions shall
      be processed through the ILCO (International Logistics Control Organization) before
      passing to the SOS.
   6.11.2. MILSTRIP Follow-up.
      6.11.2.1. FMS customers will submit follow-ups by MILSTRIP card format to AFSAC,
      Routing Identifier (RID) “FNH-(SAMIS).” Follow-ups are prepared and input per DLM
      4000.25-1.    FMS customers should input requisition follow-up transactions (AFC)
      instead of contacting AFSAC asking for better ESDs on their priority 1-8 requisitions.
      The use of the AFC follow-up request for an improved ESD is highly suggested. FMS
      customers may submit follow-ups under Document Identifier Codes (DIC)
      “AF___/____” or “AT___/____” series and are processed as follows:
          6.11.2.1.1. By E-Mail.
             6.11.2.1.1.1. Upon receipt of an “AF___/___” or “AT___/___” MILSTRIP
             follow-up transaction, AFSAC will input through SAMIS for referral to the SOS.
             When processing “AT___/___” transactions, if no record of a requisition exists
             and the DCN date is not older than 120 days, SAMIS will create an open
             requisition and pass the “AT___/___” to the SOS.
80                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


            6.11.2.1.1.2. If the DCN date is older than 120 days and matches an open
            requisition, the “AT___/___” is changed to a follow-up and sent to the SOS.
            6.11.2.1.1.3. If the follow-up is on an LRN requisition less than 30 days old, an
            “AF___/___” transaction is sent to the SOS. Processing to SAMIS is done next
            when status is received from the SOS.
        6.11.2.1.2. By Message or Letter.
            6.11.2.1.2.1. AFSAC determines if the correspondence is a routine MILSTRIP
            follow up. If it is a routine follow-up, AFSAC prepares an “AF___/___”
            transaction and inputs it to SAMIS. MILSTRIP status is sent to the FMS customer
            through usual channels.
     6.11.2.2. If the materiel was shipped, inform the FMS customer, give correct shipping
     information and suggest tracer action through the FF. If the method of shipment is the
     DTS, check AFMC Tracker web site for details. If an item shipped but delivery was not
     reported, request a “165D” interrogation and contact AFLCMC/WFCI, Policy and
     Integration.
     6.11.2.3. If the requisition was cancelled, take action depending on the type of case used
     as follows:
        6.11.2.3.1. If the cancellation is for a country-input requisition (serial numbers in rp
        40-43 less than 5000), tell the FMS customer the cancellation code, the reason (if
        available), date, and source. See Attachment 4 for serial number assignments).
        6.11.2.3.2. If the cancellation is for a system sales case requisition (serial number
        5000 or higher (excluding 8000-8999) with “S,” “D,” or “Y” case designator), the
        follow-up will be sent to the PM for an explanation, with an informational copy to the
        IMS and the FMS customer.
        6.11.2.3.3. If the cancellation is for a D/O case requisition (serial numbers 7600-
        7899), action is taken by AFSAC to have the IMS reinstate the requisition for supply
        action since there is little justification for canceling a D/O case requirement.
     6.11.2.4. If the SAMIS interrogation is negative (no record) and the date of the document
     is within 120 days, establish the requisition in SAMIS with a “D” process code to make
     sure computer passing action of the referral order occurs.
     6.11.2.5. If the above possibilities do not apply, send correspondence to the last known
     SOS for action and inform the FMS customer.
     6.11.2.6. After getting “AF___/___” transactions through the mail from the FMS
     customer, the FMS case manager will input these transactions into the D035A system.
     The latest status is sent automatically to the customer through SAMIS, by DLA
     Transaction Services, to update records.
     6.11.2.7. After getting a follow-up message or letter from either AFSAC or the FMS
     customer, the SOS will:
        6.11.2.7.1. Suspense the correspondence for a reply.
        6.11.2.7.2. Interrogate D035A for new status.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                81


         6.11.2.7.3. Tell the FMS customer and send an informational copy to AFSAC.
     6.11.2.8. After getting SAP action cards with “C”-type cancellations and “BF” status, the
     IMS will process them according to AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 5, when published. The
     IMS will coordinate with the PM, or “S” case requisitioner, when deciding appropriate
     action.
     6.11.2.9. Replies to follow-ups that include supply status are made with Document
     Identifier Codes (DIC) in the “AE__/__” series.
     6.11.2.10. Follow-up B/O Requisitions. AFLCMC/WFIUA also takes follow-up action
     for open B/O requisitions (K, Q, and R cases) greater than 30 days old for programmed
     requirements (see CLSSA) and greater than 180 days for non-programmed requirements.
         6.11.2.10.1. Follow-ups to SOS for valid supply status. Valid supply status is
         shipment, contract award or cancellation. The use of cancellation codes CA, CU and
         CY forwards cancelled requisitions to PROS for support consideration. Supply
         Assistance Requests (SARs) and E-mail are used to communicate with the SOSs to
         obtain valid supply status and reasons for shipping delays. Updated information is
         posted in SAMIS as a narrative and forwarded to CCMs and as required.
  6.11.3. Cancellation of FMS customer requisitions is governed by MILSTRIP (DLM
  4000.25-1) and AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1 (when published). Cancellations are grouped
  into two broad types: computer generated, which is assigned a self-explanatory code; and
  “CA,” which is manually assigned a code by the IMS, which must be explained. The below
  procedures explain “CA” cancellation.
     6.11.3.1. The IMS or Equipment Specialist (ES) will:
         6.11.3.1.1. Get approval of the IMS’s International Logistics Program focal point and
         first-line supervisor for all FMS “CA” cancellations.
         6.11.3.1.2. The customer will be notified on all cancelled requisitions.
         6.11.3.1.3. Not cancel Army- or Navy-managed items for which the AF is a user, but
         will fund and pass the requisition to the Inventory Control Point (ICP) shown in rp
         74-76 of the “A41” referral order. The ICP identity may also be obtained from a
         DLA Logistics Information Service interrogation.
         6.11.3.1.4. Ensure requisitions are not cancelled for the following reasons.
            6.11.3.1.4.1. High or excessive quantities.
            6.11.3.1.4.2. Stocks not available.
            6.11.3.1.4.3. Excessive CWT.
            6.11.3.1.4.4. Acquisition needed.
            6.11.3.1.4.5. Lack of funding. Note: These conditions will be brought to the
            attention of the International Logistics Program requisitioning focal point.
         6.11.3.1.5. Not cancel any FMS D/O requisition without prior approval of the
         AFSAC case manager.
 82                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


          6.11.3.1.6. Not cancel any FMS initial activation case (“S,” “D,” “Y”) requisition
          without approval of the PM/IMS. The AFLCMC SPM can be determined from the
          document serial number contained in rp 40-43.
          6.11.3.1.7. Send the AFSAC case manager an informational copy of all cancellation
          correspondence on which AFSAC is not an action addressee.
          6.11.3.1.8. Ask the AFSAC case manager for help with unresolved problems.
          6.11.3.1.9. Reinstate “CA” erroneously entered cancellations.
          6.11.3.1.10. Not cancel “H” (rp 40) FMS reparable-return-coded requisitions.
          Problems are resolved in coordination with the AFSAC case manager.
          6.11.3.1.11. Check with procurement for termination liability.
       6.11.3.2. The AFSAC case manager will:
          6.11.3.2.1. Review all “CA” correspondence on D/O case requisitions.
          6.11.3.2.2. Help the IMS/PM as requested.
          6.11.3.2.3. Make sure that “CA” cancellations are processed through SAMIS. The
          case manager will start action as needed when a “CA” cancellation notice does not
          have a matching entry on the “Cancellation Report” (UW001.-HBK).
       6.11.3.3. The PM/end item IMS will:
          6.11.3.3.1. Review all “CA” correspondence on “S” case requisitions.
              6.11.3.3.1.1. Reply to the IMS indicating approval if the reason for the “CA” is
              valid.
              6.11.3.3.1.2. Disapprove the IMS request if the reason for the “CA” is not valid.
              Include an explanation for the disapproval in correspondence to the IMS.
          6.11.3.3.2. Help the IMS as requested.
          6.11.3.3.3. Send a copy of the “CA” correspondence to the AFSAC case manager.
   6.11.4. Requisitioner Modifier Action. Country-submitted requisitions, previously input to
   SAMIS, are modified to change priority designators and required delivery dates with the
   conditions given in AFMAN 23-122. Full mission capable requisitions are downgraded by
   the input of DICs “AM___” with rp 62-64 left blank. NMCS requisitions are upgraded as
   necessary by “AM___/___” DICs with the NMCS indicator in rp 62-64.
6.12. Requisition Process for Shelf-Life Items.
   6.12.1. DoD shelf-life-management policy is prescribed in DoD 4140.27-M.           AF-level
   guidance is in AFI 23-101.
   6.12.2. Requisitioning of critical end-use sealants and adhesives in FSCs 8030-8040 for
   FMS customers involves the following:
       6.12.2.1. Critical end-use sealants and adhesives, FSCs 8030-8040, are usually
       unavailable in Supply Condition Code (SCC) “A.” SCC “A” materiel must have at least
       a remaining shelf-life of 180 days and will be provided for priority 09-15 requisitions
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  83


      unless the customer agrees to accept materiel with a lesser shelf-life. Refer to DoD
      4140.27-M for serviceability time frames for shelf-life items.
      6.12.2.2. FMS requisitions for critical materiel in the FSCs 8030-8040, are filled using
      the freshest materiel available, usually with SCC “B.” SCC “B” materiel, must have at
      least 90 days of shelf-life remaining and will use priority 01-08 unless the customer
      agrees to accept materiel with a lesser shelf-life.
      6.12.2.3. FMS customers who requisition critical shelf-life items need to ensure timely
      transportation is available. This can be done by FMS customers telling their FF not to
      hold or store critical shelf-life items, but to speed up these items on a shipped-when-
      received basis.
   6.12.3. SDRs will not be approved for expired shelf-life on critical sealants and adhesives,
   FSC 8030-8040 items.
6.13. US Navy Processing of AF FMS Requisitions.
   6.13.1. Requisitions for AF items managed by the US Navy are passed from SAMIS and/or
   the D035A system to the Navy ICP with an “NL” (reimbursable) fund code.
   6.13.2. After the Navy gets the requisition, the ICP will:
      6.13.2.1. Get the item from current stock or due-ins, ship to the FMS customer, and send
      an interfund bill to DFAS Indianapolis for reimbursement or,
      6.13.2.2. Change the “NL” fund code to “4F” (direct-cite), and give “BV” requisition
      transaction status by message to DFAS-CO/JAK in MILSTRIP format. DFAS-CO/JAK
      will then prepare “AE3” status for input to SAMIS and process a commitment in the
      base-level General Accounting and Financial System (GAFS/BQ).
   6.13.3. After changing the fund code and giving the necessary data, the Navy can enter and
   contract for a not-to exceed price, the standard price plus ten percent. When the contract is
   finalized, a copy is sent to DFAS-CO/JAK with an informational copy to the AFSAC
   geographic offices.
   6.13.4. When the proposed contractor quote to meet the requirement exceeds the standard
   price plus ten percent, the Navy ICP will tell DFAS-CO/JAK by telephone and request OA to
   enter into a contract. DFAS-CO/JAK (with AFSAC coordination) will confirm or deny the
   request by message or telephone within five workdays after getting the request from the
   Navy ICP. All confirmations by telephone to the Navy will be confirmed by message within
   48 hours.
   6.13.5. All contracts written by Navy procurement should cite “AD SN 503000” as the
   paying station on the contract. The Navy will not make payments to contractors for items
   bought under these procedures. Payments are made by DFAS-CO/JAK. Materiel/receipt
   documents (DD Forms 250) are provided to DFAS-CO/JAK by the Administrative
   Contracting Officer (ACO).
6.14. Processing Materiel Release Orders (MRO) and Redistribution Orders (RDO) to
Support FMS Requirements.
   6.14.1. The procedures in AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1 (when published) apply to FMS
   MRO and RDO as follows:
 84                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.14.1.1. MROs. It is the responsibility of the directorate of distribution (DS) of the
      Storage and Distribution Point (SDP) to decide rules for shipment with the type of option
      code and FF code in rp 46-47, DD Form 1348-1A. The FF codes and related addresses
      are listed in DLM 4000.25, Volume 6, Chapter 3.
      6.14.1.2. The use of RDOs for FMS will be used only in those instances when other
      processes are not available to supply materiel.
          6.14.1.2.1. RDOs are issued only to AF bases for priority designators 01-08 (or to
          AFMC depot supply activities for priority designators 01-15) when FMS
          requirements cannot be filled from IMS stocks.
          6.14.1.2.2. Such RDOs to AF bases will direct shipment of the materiel to the IM (or
          when more economical, to the nearest AF depot) for inspection, repackaging, and
          shipment. The FMS offer/release procedures show that priority designators 01-08 are
          shipped automatically. Therefore, AF bases are given “in-the-clear shipping” and
          “mark for” instructions.
          6.14.1.2.3. The DD Form 1348-1A used to move the materiel from the AF base to
          the AF depot will have a statement in blocks FF and GG, saying that the materiel is to
          be inspected and repacked by the receiving AF depot before shipment to the CR/FF.
          The in-the-clear shipping and mark-for instructions will also be stated.
          6.14.1.2.4. DD Forms 1348-1A, initiated as a result of RDOs, are processed in the
          same way as requisitions released by the IMS SC&D system.
      6.14.1.3. RDOs against OS AF bases are held to a minimum. This type of transaction
      must also have special shipping and transportation billing instructions to allow direct
      shipment to the customer, and must be processed in message format. The local AF
      inspector must inspect each item before shipment. The initiator of the RDO is told of the
      condition of the materiel when the items are in “used condition” but still serviceable. The
      customer is asked to accept the materiel, and if approved, the Overseas (OS) AF base will
      preserve and package the item for shipment to the FMS customer.
6.15. Preparation and Distribution of DD Form 1348-1A.
   6.15.1. Two sets of release/receipt documents, DD Forms 1348-1A, will be prepared. Both
   sets will show all data needed in rp 1-80, item nomenclature (in block “X”), and weight, and
   cube. The second set of documents, if not already sent with the notice of availability, along
   with the number 5 copy of the first set and a copy of the bill of lading, are sent to the FF.
   These documents act as advance information and are sent the same day, or not later than the
   next scheduled working day after shipments are made.
   6.15.2. The preceding distribution procedures are applicable to the DD Form 1149. For
   form preparation instructions, see DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 203
6.16. FMS Customer-Generated Requisitions.
   6.16.1. General. FMS customer materiel requisitions are input into SAMIS. System
   edits/checks requisitions for proper codes, entries or combinations of entries, which allow
   routing, and processing of the requisitions. Requisitions that do not pass these edits are
   rejected as CEX errors. These errors, mechanically suspended by SAMIS, are manually
   researched and corrected by AFSAC personnel. Often requisitions are returned to the FMS
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 85


  customer for further action or are held awaiting more information from the FMS customer.
  The purpose of this paragraph is to give the FMS customer detailed instructions for making
  valid inputs for SAMIS processing. By following these instructions, errors are reduced and
  logistic support is improved for FMS customers.
  6.16.2. Responsibilities by case type.
     6.16.2.1. AFSAC personnel will input requisitions on follow-on cases for spares or
     equipment items.
     6.16.2.2. The IMS/PM will input requisitions on systems cases – “D,” “Q,” “S,” and
     “Y,” as required.
     6.16.2.3. AFSAC personnel will input requisitions for modification kits based on FMS
     customer's request.
     6.16.2.4. The FMS customer will usually input requisitions on follow-on B/O cases,
     except Class IV/V mod cases. The FMS customer inputs requisitions on follow-on B/O
     cases:
         6.16.2.4.1. Standard Equipment (“E”) Case. This type of case applies to standard
         equipment items assigned ERRC “S” or “U.”
         6.16.2.4.2. Non-standard Equipment “E__” Case. This type of case applies to non-
         standard equipment items (ERRC “S” or “U”). A non-standard item is an item that is
         not stocked, stored, or issued for DoD use.
         6.16.2.4.3. CLSSA – FMSO II Case. This type of case is for standard spares (ERRC
         other than “S” or “U”).
         6.16.2.4.4. Standard Spares (“R”) Case. This type of case is for standard spares
         (ERRC other than “S” or “U”).
         6.16.2.4.5. Non-standard Spares (“R___”) Case. This type of case is for non-
         standard spares (ERRC other than “S” or “U”). Note: Non-standard items (support
         equipment/spares) are those items, with or without a NSN, which the DoD does not
         manage for its own use, but are needed to support a system or end item previously
         supplied on an AF FMS case. Non-standard items cannot be supplied from stock or
         be obtained through normal acquisition. Procurement will be consolidated to the
         maximum extent practical. Requisitions should be held 90 days to accommodate
         multiple submissions and requests for small quantity buys that are strictly to support
         FMS. This does not apply to valid NMCS, other high priority requests, or requests
         for improved delivery schedule. Non-standard items in support of a system or end
         item furnished by another military service are requisitioned from and furnished by
         that service. If a non-standard system or end item is obtained commercially, the non-
         standard equipment/spares to support it should also be obtained commercially (direct
         from the contractor). Exceptions to this guidance must have approval from the
         DSCA. FMS customer requests for this type of FMS support are sent through
         channels to DSCA.
  6.16.3. There are certain restrictions as to what type of items are requisitioned by the FMS
  customer on B/O cases. Unless otherwise specified these restrictions include:
 86                                                   AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.16.3.1. All B/O (“E,” “KB,” “R,” and non-standard “E” and “R”) cases:
         6.16.3.1.1. SVI or sole source items are obtained on a D/O case.
         6.16.3.1.2. Classified items must usually move through the DTS.
         6.16.3.1.3. New and unused (advice code “6P”) items are bought on a D/O case or
         B/O case. Note: This rule does not apply to “E” cases.
         6.16.3.1.4. SME items are bought on a D/O case.
         6.16.3.1.5. Commercial-type items are bought through local (in-country) sources. If
         these items are not present locally and they are bought through FMS, use advice code
         “3B” in rp 65-66 of the requisition.

          6.16.3.1.6. Explosive ordnance items in Federal Supply Group (FSG) 13 that are
          bought on D/O “A” cases or system sales case lines with an “A” follow-on cross
          reference. Note: CAD/PAD FSC 1377 items with MMAC “ES” that are bought on a
          B/O “C” cases or system sales case lines with a “C” follow-on cross reference.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  89


        6.16.3.1.7. Excess defense articles are bought on a D/O case.
        6.16.3.1.8. Modification kits are usually shown by a “K” in the fifth position of the
        NSN. Class IV mod kits are usually placed on a B/O “V” case, but they can also be
        placed on a D/O “V” case. In both instances, the requisitions are input by AFSAC
        personnel. Class V mod kits are always placed on a D/O “Q”, “W,” or “Y” case and
        requisitions are usually input by the IMS/PM/AFSAC, not by the FMS customer.
        6.16.3.1.9. If LM and LP items cannot be locally purchased or manufactured and
        they are bought through FMS, use advice code “2A” in rp 65-66 of the requisition.
        6.16.3.1.10. Munitions/munitions related items with MMAC “MN or “AQ.” These
        items are bought on a D/O “A,” “B,” or “C” case or a system sales case. For a
        complete list of MMACs, refer to DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 66.
        6.16.3.1.11. Cryptologic/COMSEC equipment/items in FSC 5810 and 5811 and/or
        MMAC “CA,” “CI,” or “CS” are bought on a D/O or B/O “O” case and selected
        system sales cases.
     6.16.3.2. “E” Cases (standard equipment). All restrictions in paragraph 6.16.3.1 apply.
     In addition, the following restrictions apply:
        6.16.3.2.1. Spares. Only equipment items with ERRC “S” or “U” are requisitioned
        on this type of case. Spares with ERRC other than “S” or “U” are requisitioned on a
        “KB” or “R” case.
        6.16.3.2.2. Non-standard items are usually MMAC coded “XA” “XL,” “XT” “XV,”
        ''XW,” “XX,” ''XY,” ''XZ,” “EX,” or “PU.” These items are requisitioned on a non-
        standard “E” (equipment) or “R” (spares) case or bought on a D/O or system-sales
        case.
        6.16.3.2.3. Advice code “6P” (new and unused) is used if authorized in the LOA.
     6.16.3.3. Non-standard Equipment Case. All restrictions in paragraph 6.16.3.1 apply. In
     addition, the following restrictions apply:
        6.16.3.3.1. Spares. Same as paragraph 6.16.3.2.1
        6.16.3.3.2. Standard Items. Standard equipment items (ERRC “S” or “U”) are
        requisitioned on an “E___” case and standard spares on a “KB__” or “R__” case.
     6.16.3.4. “K___” (other than “KA”) CLSSA (FMSO II) Spares Case. All restrictions in
     paragraph 6.16.3.1 apply. In addition, the following restrictions apply:
        6.16.3.4.1. Equipment items (ERRC “S” or “U”) are requisitioned on an “E” standard
        or non-standard case.
        6.16.3.4.2. Non-standard Items. Same as paragraph 6.16.3.2.2

  6.16.4. Research Products.
     6.16.4.1. There are several microfiche products available to FMS customers. These
     products are useful when:
         6.16.4.1.1. Converting LRNs to NSN(s).
         6.16.4.1.2. Converting NSN to LRN.
         6.16.4.1.3. Identifying/verifying LRN(s):
             6.16.4.1.3.1. Name to code.
             6.16.4.1.3.2. Code to name.
         6.16.4.1.4. Obtaining supply management data:
             6.16.4.1.4.1. SOS.
             6.16.4.1.4.2. UI. For a complete list of UI codes, refer to DoD 4100.39-M,
             Volume 10, Table 53
             6.16.4.1.4.3. Quantity unit pack (QUP). For a complete list of QUP codes, refer
             to DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 56.
             6.16.4.1.4.4. Substitute/interchangeable items using phrase codes.       For a
             complete list of phrase codes, refer to DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 52.
             6.16.4.1.4.5. Item name.
             6.16.4.1.4.6. Other valuable data.
     6.16.4.2. These products are used to find out what type of requisition (“A01,” “A02,”
     “A04,” or “A05”) is needed. Other data is used in the preparation of the requisition. For
     example, if an item has QUP of other than 0 to 1, the quantity (rp 25-29) ordered is in
     increments of the QUP. The UI is checked to prevent rejection of requisition from the
     SOS.
     6.16.4.3. The primary research product recommended for FMS customers is the DLA
     Logistics Information Service. Estimated costs are used for budgetary purposes only.
     These products are bought on present B/O publication (“P”) cases for DoD supply
     catalogs, or they are requested on D/O publication cases.
     6.16.4.4. In addition, FMS customers can get management data from the Stock Number
     User Directory (SNUD/D071) data system. Various types of management data are
     available to FMS customers based on stock number and type of data registration set up by
     the user. Customers wanting to join in the D071 data system will ask for authorization
     from AFSC/LG.
  6.16.5. Types of Requisitions. There are four types of requisition that a customer may input:
     6.16.5.1. “A01”:
         6.16.5.1.1. Use. If an item has a valid active NSN assigned, the “A01” requisition
         should be used. Verify the NSN in the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS).
         6.16.5.1.2. Preparation (see Attachment 3).
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                91


          6.16.5.1.3. Transmission:
             6.16.5.1.3.1. Usually by DLA Transaction Services or other available
             communications system.
             6.16.5.1.3.2. Under unusual circumstances and when the priority warrants, a
             message is used. This method of transmission is held to a minimum.
      6.16.5.2. “A02”:
          6.16.5.2.1. Use. Use only if the item has a valid:
             6.16.5.2.1.1. LRN. Verify in the FLIS that a valid NSN does not exist.
             6.16.5.2.1.2. CAGE. Verify in the FLIS.
             6.16.5.2.1.3. TO number use only valid AF TO numbers. If one or more of the
             above is not available, use the “A05.”
          6.16.5.2.2. Preparation.
          6.16.5.2.3. Transmission. Same as paragraph 6.16.5.1.3.1
      6.16.5.3. “A04”:
          6.16.5.3.1. Use. Use only for “NC” or “ND” (temporary stock number) (rp 12-13)
          items. AFSAC personnel can also use the “A04” format when inputting Class IV
          mod kit requisitions on a “V” case. If the “NC” or “ND” number is not in the Federal
          Logistics (FEDLOG), use the “A02” or “A05” format.
          6.16.5.3.2. Preparation (see Attachment 3).
          6.16.5.3.3. Transmission. Same as paragraph 6.16.5.1.3
      6.16.5.4. “A05”:
          6.16.5.4.1. Use. Use for items which do not qualify for ''A01,” ''A02,” “A04.”
          6.16.5.4.2. Preparation.
          6.16.5.4.3. Transmission:
             6.16.5.4.3.1. These requisitions cannot be sent through a communications
             network because of the added information required (i.e., TO, figure/index
             number, CAGE, etc.).
             6.16.5.4.3.2. Usually, DD Forms 1348 with the added information are mailed to
             AFSAC.
             6.16.5.4.3.3. Same as paragraph 6.16.5.1.3. Note: The added remarks section
             must have the system or end item identity (type/model/series) on which the
             item is used. In the case of non-standard items, the FMS customer gives the
             FMS case on which the non-standard system or end item was bought
6.17. Hydrazine (H-70) Support for F-16 Aircraft.
   6.17.1. To order H-70, the AFSAC CCM creates a C05 custom commitment (see paragraph
   6.20) in SAMIS with minimum quantity order that are in multiples required per drum.
 92                                                   AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   6.17.2. After the C05 is created and funds are reserved, the CCM creates a MIPR that
   includes MIPR number, document number, mark-for address, supplementary address, ship-to
   address, total dollars, name of product (Hydrazine H-70), NSN, quantity required, billing
   address, and AFSAC POC information.
   6.17.3. The CCM sends the MIPR to DLA Energy, 1014 Billy Mitchell Blvd, Bldg 1621,
   San Antonio, TX 78226
   6.17.4. DLA Energy handles the contract and transportation. A NOA will be issued to the
   ship-to address since this is a hazardous rocket fuel. DLA Energy will use the POC
   information to advise of the order status.
   6.17.5. The CCM initiator will maintain the C05 status in SAMIS.
6.18. PROS Standard Item Guidance.
   6.18.1. The PROS contract incorporates supply and repair of standard items when the
   managing activity does not have organic capability or contractual support that meets the
   needs of the FMS customer. The IM, together with the 430 SCMS, is best qualified to
   determine the appropriate course of action to fill a requisition.
      6.18.1.1. Each facility may determine its own internal guidelines. These guidelines must
      ensure that each item meets PROS eligibility and that status has been checked to ensure
      there will be no duplication of support.
      6.18.1.2. Requisitions Received at the SOS. If the SOS determines they cannot support
      and chooses to pass to PROS for support, they must include a SAMIS requisition for
      supply and a National Item Identification Number (NIIN) narrative for maintenance
      efforts which provides a statement from the ES/engineer providing all current USAF
      engineering approved sources, confirmation the source can perform Unique Identification
      (UID), if required, and ES/engineer’s name, office symbol, phone number and a
      statement as to how long the source approval is authorized. No items requiring approval
      of sources or re-approval of first article test will be passed to PROS.
      6.18.1.3. Requisitions Received Direct to PROS. On occasion, the customer will process
      standard items to the PROS contractor using only the part number. SAMIS does not have
      the capability to check the Acquisition Advice Codes (AAC) of part numbers which
      places the burden of determination on the contractor. Upon receipt, the contractor will
      research against contract requirement and immediately identify all USAF standard items
      to the appropriate AFSC office for review/consideration. The contractor will process an
      “X1” status request in SAMIS (with narrative) and a DLA Transaction Services
      Automated Message Exchange System (DAMES) message to the appropriate AFSC focal
      point (cc to CCM and PROS PMO) and request approval to continue with the
      procurement or maintenance effort. This request will be open for 30 days. After 30 days,
      the request will be cancelled and an “X4” will be processed to the PROS PMO requesting
      assistance. If no response is received from the AFSC, the requisition will be cancelled.
          6.18.1.3.1. If approved, the AFSC focal point and IM will coordinate with the
          ES/engineer to obtain a list of all approved sources to include name, CAGE, address,
          POC, phone number, fax number and E-mail address. The AFSC will respond via
          DAMES and SAMIS requisition narrative for supply request and via NIIN narrative
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    93


          for maintenance requests. This narrative must include all of the above information or
          the requirement will not be supported.
          6.18.1.3.2. The AFSC FMS focal point will be responsible for maintaining this
          information and provide a SAMIS NIIN narrative for all maintenance efforts and
          provide a requisition narrative for supply requisitions. The narrative (NIIN or
          requisition) will include the NSN/part number, the AF approved repair/maintenance
          sources, confirmation the source can perform UID, if applicable and the timeframe
          the source is valid. It is beneficial to the program for the SOS to identify why they
          cannot support, but is not required. The narrative must include the ES/engineer’s
          name, office symbol, phone number, and E-mail address.
      6.18.1.4. No country approval is needed to pass a non-programmed standard item to
      PROS once the managing activity determines it to be the best SOS. Normal blocker edits
      still apply.

Section 6D—COMMITMENTS

6.19. Bulk Commitments.
   6.19.1. Purpose and Scope. The purpose of the bulk commitment transaction is to control
   case funds at the case/line item level. Bulk commitments are used only on a limited basis for
   non-requisition cases when it is not practical to use custom commitments. Bulk
   commitments do not provide sufficient tracking of status and deliveries against cases/line
   items.
   6.19.2. Establishment. When a LOA is countersigned/coordinated by DSCA and returned to
   AFSAC, send it to the customer for signature, and establish the case in SAMIS. SAF-
   negotiated case/line items are established in SAMIS upon receipt of the courtesy copy.
   Additional information can be found in the SAMIS help screen that explains the data
   elements and bulk commitment transaction.
   6.19.3. Processing. The AFSAC case manager processes bulk commitments through the
   SAMIS terminal using the QAID “COM.”
6.20. Custom Commitments.
   6.20.1. Custom Commitment (C05). Custom commitments allow definitization and
   commitment of funds for non-requisition type requirements on a case/line item. The DIC
   “C05” denotes a custom commitment. In addition, an open custom commitment master
   record is established and updated with custom commitment status, custom commitment
   shipment status, and deliveries. Committed value on case/line items having type
   commitment code “C” can only be updated using custom commitment action. In special
   situations (for example, AF technical orders) it may be necessary to use custom commitments
   against case/line items having a type commitment code “R.” When developing C05, a valid
   MILSTRIP document number is required.
   6.20.2. Custom Commitment Status (CE5). CE5 transactions update information on the
   open “C05.” The “CE5” transaction allows updates to RIC and reporting activity codes, AF
   appropriations, quantities, commitment descriptions, control reasons, control dates, and total-
   committed value.
 94                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   6.20.3. Custom Commitment Shipment Status (CS5). CS5 transactions update information
   on the shipment of materiel requirements shown by the open “C05.”
   6.20.4. Freight Forwarder Transactions (XDA and XDB). “XDA” and “XDB” transactions
   give the customer information about the status of the items on the custom commitment. The
   “XDA” transaction tells the customer the AF has received the items and gives the customer
   an estimated shipping date. The “XDB” transaction tells the customer the AF is shipping the
   item back. These transactions will usually be used for repair/return items.
   6.20.5. Establish Open Custom Commitment. Open custom commitments are established by
   a custom commitment (C05) transaction. A bypass code “R” will be used if reopening a
   completed “C05.” All “C-5” transactions are input using an interactive remote display
   station. The input screen QAID is “CC.” When a “C05” transaction is entered, SAMIS will
   do a series of cursory edits on form and content. Use the RIC of the activity responsible for
   performing the service of the custom commitment (Reference Attachment 5). When filling
   the Reporting Activity Code (RAC), use the RAC of the activity responsible for billing the
   custom commitment (See Attachment 6 for a complete list of RACs). If a FF transaction
   (XDA) is needed, enter a “Y” on the question line. The remaining elements on the input
   screen will then be edited by SAMIS.

Table 6.4. SAMIS Edit Data
        Element                                            Edit
Estimated Shipping Date     Must be valid Julian Date
Repair Source Code          Must be “A,” “C,” “F,” “G,” “H,” “L,” or “P”
      6.20.5.1. Screen elements not given above have no on-screen edits. When all edits are
      passed, the “C05” transaction will be staged as SAMIS input to be processed during the
      daily batch cycle. This is also true of the “XDA” transactions when requested.
   6.20.6. Updates to Open “C05.” Updates to an open “C05” are done with “CES,” “CS5,”
   and delivery transactions. All “CES” and “CS5” transactions are input using an interactive
   remote display station. The input screen QAID is “CCST.” The first screen has two
   elements: DIC and DCN. Enter on this screen either “CE5” or “CS5” and an open “C05”
   DCN. The second screen is the “CES” or “CS5” transaction input screen. Screen elements
   filled from the open “C05” data elements are: RIC, RAC, AF appropriation code (reference
   AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes (Fiscal Year 2013), quantity,
   DCN, supplementary address, LOA line item code, commitment description, and project
   code. These ele65-ments will be referred to as the filled elements. When a “CES” or “CS5”
   transaction is entered, SAMIS will do a series of cursory edits on form and content.
      6.20.6.1. For “CE5” transactions, the edits are based on the “CE5” transaction status
      code. These codes are used to show the status of a custom commitment or the update
      action that is to be done on an open custom commitment. They are unique to SAMIS.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   95




Table 6.5. Custom Commitment (CE5) Status Codes
  Status Code    Explanation
      MA         Item released for shipment or services actually completed; updates
                 Estimated Completion Date, ECD (control date-1) and updates unit price.
     MC          Increase in unit price which commits funds against open custom
                 commitment committed value (value controlled custom commitment
                 only).
     MH          Changes the commitment description (value controlled custom
                 commitment only).
     MQ          Cancellation (use only on quantity controlled custom commitments).
     MZ          Decrease in unit price which decommits funds against open custom
                 commitment committed value (value controlled custom commitment
                 only).
   Special       Explanation
 Control Date
 Status Code
     M1          Establish or change control date #1 (estimated service completion date).
     M2          Establish or change control date #2.
     M3          Establish or change control date #3.
     M4          Establish or change control date #4.
     M5          Establish or change control date #5.
     M6          Establish or change control date #6.
          6.20.6.1.1. For status code “MA,” the only filled element that may be changed is
          quantity. All other filled elements must stay the same for the transaction to be staged
          into SAMIS.
          6.20.6.1.2. For status codes “MC” and “MZ” the only filled elements that may be
          changed are quantity and commitment description. For status “MC,” the total
          committed value must be greater than the remaining committed value. For status
          “MZ,” the total committed value must be less than the remaining committed value.
          Status code “MZ” with a total committed value of zero will complete the open “C05.”
          6.20.6.1.3. For status code “MH,” the filled elements that may be changed are RIC,
          RAC, and AF appropriation codes, and the commitment description.
          6.20.6.1.4. For status codes “M1” through “M6,” only control reason and control
          date may be changed. Control reasons are used by the user to provide internal
          messages to the user. Control reason “6” is the commitment description-continued
          field and provides information to the billing office. Control dates may be used to
          have SAMIS produce a follow-up notice for the user. This notice will be produced
          when the control date is reached. To delete a control-reason and date, the status code
          modifier (*) must be entered.
 96                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       6.20.6.2. If you need a FF transaction (XDA), enter a “Y” on the question line. The
       remaining elements on the input screen will then be edited by SAMIS. Reference Table
       6.4 and paragraph 6.20.5.1
       6.20.6.3. For a “CS5” transaction none of the filled elements may be changed except
       quantity. SAMIS automatically stages “XDB” transactions when a “CS5” transaction is
       staged. The unfilled elements are edited as follows:

Table 6.6. CS5 Unfilled Elements
 Element                    Edit
 Suffix Code                Must be Alpha/Numeric or Blank
 Transportation Bill Code   Must be “A” - “H,” “J” - “N,” “P” - “S,” “U,” “V,” “X,” “Y,” or
                            Blank
 Date Shipped               Must be a valid Julian Date
 Mode of Shipment           Must be “A” - “Z,” “2” - “9,” or Blank
 Repair Source Code         Must be “A,” “C,” “F,” “G,” “H,” “L,” or “P”
       6.20.6.4. Delivery transactions update the delivered dollar value and committed value on
       an open “C05” by the dollar value of the delivery record. There will be no CEXs due to
       UI or quantity variances. A delivery record will not update the quantity on an open
       “C05.” If the dollar value of the delivery record exceeds the committed value, the open
       “C05” will be completed.
   6.20.7. Reopen a Completed “C05.” If a “C05” is completed and additional deliveries are
   anticipated, the “C05” needs to be reopened. To do this, re-input the “C05,” use bypass code
   “R,” and commit the dollar amount of the anticipated deliveries.
   6.20.8. Interrogation of Open “C05.” To interrogate for an open “C05,” use QAID 168.
   This interrogation gives a list of all open “CO5s.” Interrogation can be by RIC or RAC.
   SAMIS also produces a weekly list of open “CO5s” by RAC. Each RIC will receive a list of
   their open “CO5s.” The product control number for this weekly product is U-WOO1.-HDR.
   The billing offices should use this product to determine the DCN to use when delivery

   6.21.1. A Preliminary Technical Survey Report (PTSR) and/or an Engineering Requirement
   Plan (ERP) may be required for C-E sales before making up price and availability LOA data.
   The PTSR consists of a requirement statement, an operational concept, a statement of the
   customer's capabilities, and other supporting information. The ERP is more detailed than the
   PTSR. The SCO and the FMS customer make up both of these documents, with help from
   the AF as necessary. This information comes from the site survey.
   6.21.2. AFSAC will:
       6.21.2.1. Process request for P&A data from the FMS customer in anticipation of a buy
       of C-E materiel or services.

     negotiators will not discuss program requirements which are not part of the LOA, even if
     these added requirements are part of or derived from the program being discussed. Such
     added requirements are presented to the USG through channels and discussion of them is
     put off until then.
     6.21.2.14. Maintain surveillance over the financial and logistical condition of the case
     throughout the performance of the case.
     6.21.2.15. Take part in configuration/definitization/provisioning conferences chaired by
     the PM or SAF/IA. The PM, FMS customer, and inventory manager list concurrent
     support requirements for HQ AFMC. The AFSAC helps in making up an FMS
     customer’s integrated logistics support plan.
     6.21.2.16. Obtain a copy of the final definitized listings from the PM and will make sure
     that proper shipping addresses are in the MAPAD.
     6.21.2.17. Ensure all requisitions are input to the SAMIS for supply action. AFSAC will
     send copies of the “A41” requisition referral listings to the PM.

  6.21.4. The PM, will:
     6.21.4.1. Check with the Program Office (PO) to get a general availability statement and
     a statement of likely impact on AF and other FMS programs. The PM will show any
     added information the FMS customer must give to allow for the establishment of a P&A
     or LOAD package.
     6.21.4.2. Send the completed P&A or LOAD package to the International Logistics
     Program focal point. The P&A data or LOAD is based on the type of system used,
     source of supply, system complexity, FMS customer mission requirements, and methods
     of support. P&A data or LOAD is not suitable for inclusion in an LOA. Standard factors
     are used (such as a percentage of the system cost for an initial spares estimate).
     Contractor price and delivery estimates are not necessary.
     6.21.4.3. Get the P&A or LOAD request from the AFLCMC/WFN SO and check with
     the PO when creating pricing data.           The PM will check with AFMETCAL
     AFLCMC/WNMMI when forming the FMS customer’s PMEL requirements and will
     check with the cognizant manpower organization when forming added manpower
     requirements (i.e., task teams, in-country program manager, WSLO, etc.). The PM will
     check coordinate with the AFLCMC SATODS Country Team when setting up the first
     TO requirements and ensure releasability to the customer through the applicable Foreign
     Disclosure Policy Office (FDPO).

       organizations.
       6.21.4.10. Requisition all required items and stop requisition input 90 days after the
       delivery of the last system.
       6.21.4.11. Check on program review dates proposed by the AFSAC case manager, and
       prepare all system- and item-related data for program renewal.
       6.21.4.12. Maintain overall surveillance of IMS actions necessary to support the system
       delivery and activation dates, including workarounds if RADs cannot be met.
       6.21.4.13. Issue Notice of Supply and Service Completion (NSSC) report when all
       materiel has shipped or services performed. When there is not an PM, the IMS division
       assumes the responsibilities shown below:
       6.21.4.14. Receive, review, and process all applicable requisitions in a timely manner.
       6.21.4.15. Get RAD reports and start necessary actions to meet the RAD, or justify the
       reason for delivery slippage.
6.22. Weapon Systems “S” Case Processing.
   6.22.1. The procedures in paragraph 6.21 on “D” cases apply to “S” cases. The following
   information also applies:
       6.22.1.1. “S” cases are for the sale of aircraft systems, from either new production or
       inventory. This includes the aircraft, spare engines, spare parts, SE, services, delivery,
       and training.
       6.22.1.2. The AFSAC case manager must ask for LOAD from AFLCMC Propulsion
       Directorate for in-production engines, and other engines. AFSAC must ask for LOAD
       from AFLCMC/EBH (Munitions) for Cartridge Actuated Devices and Propellant
       Actuated Devices (CAD/PAD) requirements.
       6.22.1.3. The AFSAC case manager must ensure inclusion of costs associated for
       participating in the applicable Component Improvement Program (CIP) on new
       production sales (or IEMP on sales from inventory), the Aircraft Structural Integrity
       Program (ASIP), and the TCG.
6.23. Selected Systems “Y” Case Processing.
   6.23.1. The procedures in paragraph 6.21 on “D” cases apply to “Y” cases. The following
   additional information also applies:

       Included in these types of cases are missiles, pods, special-purpose vehicles, and complex
       technical assistance programs.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 101


      6.23.1.2. When there is no PM, the IMS division assumes the PM responsibilities.
      6.23.1.3. Not all “Y” cases require a site survey or the development of an Integrated
      Logistics Support Plan (ILSP). Contact the Command case manager for direction.
6.24. Selected Systems “Q” Case Processing.
   6.24.1. The procedures in paragraph 8.22 on “D” cases apply to “Q” cases. The following
   information also applies:
      6.24.1.1. “Q” cases are for the sale of systems other than those sold under “D,” “S,” and
      “Y” cases. AFSAC negotiates these cases including all supporting materiel and services.
      6.24.1.2. Most “Q” cases do not need a site survey or the development of an ILSP.
      Contact the Command case manager for direction.
      6.24.1.3. AFSAC negotiates other package sales that combine different AFSAC-
      negotiated cases on a single LOA, when the cases are related to a single program. These
      package sales are negotiated for the individual cases as detailed in paragraphs 6.27
      through 6.42. For example, an LOA, which includes a B/O equipment case, a line item
      for a B/O spare parts case, a line item for services, repair/return, etc.
6.25. Air Force Inventory Systems - Aircraft.
   6.25.1. When aircraft are sold, leased, or loaned out of AF inventory, the shelf/service life
   remaining on installed (CAD/PAD) items must be considered. The LOA will include a
   separate dollar line to cover CAD/PAD replacement support for the first 36 months of
   ownership. The PM checks with AFLCMC/EBH as the AFMC OPR for CAD/PAD items.
   AFLCMC/EBH will assist in determining the replacement status of installed CAD/PAD
   items based on install dates and current production lead times. Items needing replacement
   must be funded and ordered on the next CAD/PAD buy. Early awareness increases
   AFLCMC/EBH’s capability to get assets from inventory or existing production where
   possible.
   6.25.2. Determining the condition of aircraft and installed items is according to AFI 21-103,
   Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting.

Section 6F—FMS CASES OTHER THAN “D,” “Q,” “S,” and “Y.”

6.26. General.
   6.26.1. These cases provide follow-on support for FMS customers. A brief description of
   the purpose of each case is given for both B/O and D/O cases.
   6.26.2. The case manager is both logistically and financially responsible for his/her cases.
   Each case is reviewed on a periodic basis. This helps prevent reconciliation problems at case
   closure. All correspondence should reference case designator and DCN.
6.27. “A” Cases—Defined Order (D/O) Cases for Munitions.
   6.27.1. Munitions, including conventional munitions, issues from stock will comply with the
   below requirements:
      6.27.1.1. If a munitions item on-hand exceeds the inventory objective, the excess is
      releasable. The inventory objective is the planned War Reserve Materiel (WRM)
 102                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       requirement as determined by the non-nuclear consumables annual analysis, and defense
       guidance, plus peacetime objective requirements.
       6.27.1.2. If the on-hand level of an item is below the inventory objective but above the
       procurement objective, HQ USAF concurrence is necessary before release for FMS. The
       procurement objective is the level of items wanted within the FY’s available dollars. All
       these objectives are determined at HQ USAF level or higher.
       6.27.1.3. If on-hand stocks of a munitions item are below the procurement level, or are
       being used to compensate for shortages or other munitions below the procurement level,
       routine sales from stock are denied.
       6.27.1.4. AF or OSD officials consider exceptions to this guidance for high priority
       SAPs that are in the national interest.
   6.27.2. SAF/IA LOAD requests are sent to the AFLCMC/EBH for munitions procured
   through the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA). AFLCMC/EBH will
   process SMCA requests IAW Joint Conventional Ammunition Policy and Procedures
   (JCAPP) 15, Security Assistance Guidance.
   6.27.3. There are additional guidelines for the repair of nuclear-related munitions assets.
   These items are identified with MMAC “CM,” or FSG II. Repair procedures for nuclear-
   related munitions assets materiel are in Chapter 8.
   6.27.4. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), TOs, and EOD storage TOs needed are
   identified in the LOR. Requests for EOD TOs are sent to SAF/IAPX for release authority.
6.28. “C” Cases—B/O Cases for CAD/PAD. CAD/PAD items are subject to specific shelf or
service life and it is not economically possible for the AF to buy these items except on a phased
procurement basis. To support this at an acceptable economic level, the AF buys CAD/PAD
items once each year using annual requirements computations. Out-of cycle requirements are
placed on procurement by AFLCMC/EBH on an as-required basis. Customer requirements
made outside the annual buy program are subject to increased prices, extended CWTs, and
potential non-support due to minimum procurement quantities.
   6.28.1. In May, AFLCMC/EBH drafts an annual CAD/PAD call letter and sends it to
   AFSAC. The draft call letter includes the following:
       6.28.1.1. Time constraints for processing CAD/PAD cases from the start of the call letter
       through the LOAD process, case acceptance, implementation, and contract negotiations
       for the AF annual buy program.
       6.28.1.2. An attached list of CAD/PAD items by aircraft with NSN, noun, LRN current
       shelf/service life, procurement lead time, quantity per aircraft, etc.
   6.28.2. After getting the draft call letter, AFSAC completes and sends it to the FMS
   customer. The final version of the letter gives specific timeframes in which the FMS
   customers must respond with a LOR for their requirements to be considered in the annual
   buy.
   6.28.3. When an LOR is received, AFSAC proceeds to develop the LOA from the dollar
   amount specified by the customer.
   6.28.4. If the customer accepts the LOA, AFSAC prepares an IPD after receiving OA.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 103


   6.28.5. AFSAC inputs requisitions into SAMIS for subsequent referral to D035 (see Section
   6C).
   6.28.6. The terms of delivery of the LOA must have, as a minimum, a statement that
   sensitive and HAZMAT are delivered Free On Board (FOB) vessel/aircraft, CONUS port of
   exit, under the conditions of DTC “8,” which must have an Offer Release Code (ORC) “Z.”
   Special transportation conditions or procedures, if required, are defined in the LOA.
6.29. “E” Cases—B/O Cases for SE and Supplies.
   6.29.1. “E” cases are used to buy items such as SE, vehicles, tools, shop equipment, test
   equipment, and similar supply items of US origin that are frequently used by the customer.
   Equipment items have an “S” or “U” ERRC code. The B/O case sets up a value for buying
   items until funds are exhausted. The FMS country will submit a LOR signed by the
   appropriate signature level to AFSAC CM. The LOR will state the type of equipment and
   dollar value of the proposed case if the customer desires. AFSAC will input and control the
   requisition for these items if the FMS country desires.
   6.29.2. For case-funded equipment, the organization for which the equipment was purchased
   is responsible for the protection and accountability of the equipment. The equipment will be
   inventoried annually by the using organization. At the end of the program, the case-funded
   equipment should be offered to the customer. If the customer does not want the equipment, it
   may continue to be used in support of other SAPs; turned into the local disposal office and
   processed as abandoned, excess, or surplus equipment; or turned into the Worldwide
   Warehouse Redistribution Service (WWRS), managed by AFSAC, for resale.
6.30. “G” Cases—Defined Order (D/O) or B/O Services Cases.
   6.30.1. Introduction.   A “G” case provides AFMC technical assistance, including the
   following services.
      6.30.1.1. CETS.
      6.30.1.2. IEMP.
      6.30.1.3. Technical Coordination Program (TCP).
      6.30.1.4. Electronic Combat International Security Assistance Program (ECISAP).
      ECISAP services can be on a G case; customer required deliverables must be written on a
      “Q” case.
      6.30.1.5. FLO administrative support.
      6.30.1.6. International Logistics Communication System (ILCS).
   6.30.2. The purchaser's request must describe the services and scope of assistance needed,
   the time frame for desired assistance, and the type of case requested (either D/O or B/O). If
   the purchaser asks for a B/O case, the request should show the dollar value desired. Separate
   requests should be made for each type or category of technical assistance.
   6.30.3. CETSs. CETSs are described in Chapter 8 of this manual.
   6.30.4. IEMP Cases.
104                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.30.4.1. IEMP cases provide follow-on technical and logistics services for participating
      countries. The CIP is a USG-managed program which develops improved parts and
      maintenance techniques. CIP benefits are available only to IEMP participants.
      6.30.4.2. Request LOAD from the office listed above. If writing a follow-on case,
      request LOAD at least seven months before the expiration of current coverage.
      6.30.4.3. Follow-on cases are prepared, processed, accepted, and implemented no later
      than two months before the effective period of the program. IEMP managers will
      provide the LOAD no later than seven months before the start of the program period.
      The IEMP manager will provide the FMS purchaser's share of each year's pro rata cost
      and travel requirements no later than 30 days from requested date.
      6.30.4.4. Offer Expiration Date (OED) extensions will be limited to one and only if it
      does not affect the period of performance.
      6.30.4.5. IEMP cases are written for a three-year period unless the purchaser has
      requested in writing a one- or two-year period. No LOA will be written for less than one
      year.
  6.30.5. TCP Cases.
      6.30.5.1. The TCP is a follow-on support effort to continue improving systems
      serviceability, maintainability, and reliability (improved parts, maintenance techniques,
      increased inspection and overhaul intervals, modifications, etc.). The systems TCG
      serves as the single POC for follow-on technical and engineering support to member
      countries for modification, maintenance, and operation of their systems, with the
      exception of aircraft engines. (The AFLCMC engine manager is responsible for
      managing each respective FMS engine and its IEMP.)
      6.30.5.2. Obtain LOAD from the AFLCMC/WFN SO (collocated at the AFLCMC
      Program Office location). If requested by the customer, the TCG will include LOAD for
      an engineering drawing line. A TCP member must submit an LOR defining their
      requirements and whether to amend the current case or write a new LOA to the AFSAC
      CCM NLT six months prior to the expiration date of the current case. Follow-on cases
      are prepared, processed, accepted and implemented no later than two months before the
      effective period of such program. LOADs will be processed and completed per DSAMS
      Milestones and Anticipated Offer Date (AOD) group codes, as listed in DSCA Manual
      5105.38-M, Table C5.T6 . The TCG manager will provide the FMS purchaser's share of
      each year's pro rata cost and travel requirements.
      6.30.5.3. TCG cases are written for no less than a three-year period. No LOA or
      Amendment will be written for less than three years.
  6.30.6. FLO. The only service required on a FLO case is office space and the Wright-
  Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) Telephone System Flight services; all other services
  have to be requested by the customer on the LOR (i.e., secretarial support, communication-
  cellular and non-cellular, internet, office equipment/supplies, etc.). Services available under a
  FLO case include the following.
      6.30.6.1. Office Space/Utilities. Once the case manager defines the period of
      performance for a FLO case, they will request pricing data from AFLCMC/WFCA
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                             105


     (Admin Financial Analysis). AFLCMC/WFCA will provide the case manager with the
     total annual cost of the FLO’s office space/utilities/maintenance services.
        6.30.6.1.1. Once the FLO case is implemented, the case manager will set-up a
        custom commitment of 4E (reimbursable) in SAMIS for each country and provide the
        information to AFLCMC/WFCA so they can bill the FMS case for the office
        space/utilities/maintenance services. The AFLCMC/WFCI delivery reports the
        charges in SAMIS and DFAS makes the disbursements.
        6.30.6.1.2. WPAFB Telephone System Flights. Once the case manager defines the
        period of performance for the FLO case, they will estimate the cost and ensure that
        the funds are available on the FMS case to cover the telephone service charges.
        6.30.6.1.3. Once the FLO case is implemented, the case manager will set-up a
        custom commitment (4E - reimbursable) in SAMIS for each country and provide the
        information on to AFLCMC/WFCA for them to bill the FMS case for the telephone
        services.
        6.30.6.1.4. Each month, when AFLCMC/WFCA receives the WPAFB Telephone
        System Flight services billing, a breakout of the applicable countries’ charges are
        attached to a letter and forwarded to the case manager to verify that funds are
        available and then forwarded on to the FLO office for them to verify the charges are
        valid. The FLO office will return the approved letter back to AFLCMC/WFCA for
        their files. AFLCMC/WFCI delivery reports the charges in SAMIS and DFAS makes
        the disbursements.
     6.30.6.2. Secretarial Support.
        6.30.6.2.1. These procedures only apply to those FLO cases which have a line item
        on their FMS case to provide secretarial support. The case manager will prepare a
        funding document request (to include a Production Work Schedule [PWS] and a copy
        of the FMS case if sole sourced) and forward to AFLCMC/WFCA for PR to be
        processed within Comprehensive Cost and Requirement System (CCARS).           The
        Command CM is responsible for providing the PWS to the case manager to be
        included in the funding document request. AFLCMC/WFCA prepares the funding
        documents and submits them to DFAS.
     6.30.6.3. Commercial Express Delivery Services. The FLO office may request to have
     commercial express delivery (i.e., FedEx). FedEx charges are billed to the country
     Government Purchase Card (GPC) and maintained by the FLO coordinator.
     6.30.6.4. Internet, Telephone, and Water. The case manager sends the funding document
     request to AFLCMC/WFCA              and they process a Miscellaneous Obligation
     Reimbursement Document (MORD) in CCaRS. The FMS customer receives and
     validates monthly invoices. AFLCMC/WFCA certifies the invoices and submit to DFAS
     for payment. AFLCMC/WFCA also prepares funding documents and submits them to
     DFAS.
     6.30.6.5. International Merchant Purchase Authorization Card (IMPAC). The IMPAC
     allows the FLO to purchase from various sources as long as they accept the IMPAC. The
     maximum purchase is $2.5K, unless the item(s) being purchased are GSA-priced.
106                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


  6.30.7. ECISAP Cases.
      6.30.7.1. Introduction. The ECISAP case is managed by the Deputy Under Secretary of
      the AF, International Affairs, Systems Division with the executive office at
      AFLCMC/WNYI, Electronic Warfare FMS. The ECISAP provides total system
      engineering and technical services support to FMS users of software reprogrammable
      Electronic Combat (EC) systems throughout their lifecycles. The ECISAP serves as the
      single point of contact for EC reprogrammable system development and follow-on
      support, as well as a forum for the exchange of technical information that is common to
      all ECISAP country participants.
      6.30.7.2. For new customers there is a one-time facility buy-in charge.
      6.30.7.3. Preparation of LOAD. In response to a customer LOR for ECISAP support of a
      system, the CM will develop a three-part request for LOAD. Part I is for
      AFLCMC/WNYI, Part II for HQ Air Combat Command (ACC), Flight Operations
      Division, SA Branch (HQ ACC/A3TS), and Part III for HQ USAF/INXFJ. (Break-out
      details for the LOAD are provided below.) All three organizations should receive copies
      of the entire request.
         6.30.7.3.1. The respective LOAD sources should specify costs (for each requested
         system) as follows (along with the costs, the LOAD sources should provide
         descriptive details of services and deliverables as appropriate).
             6.30.7.3.1.1. AFLCMC/WNYI for the following.
                 6.30.7.3.1.1.1. One-time facility buy-in.
                 6.30.7.3.1.1.2. ECISAP services to include those in producing ECISAP
                 deliverables.
                 6.30.7.3.1.1.3. ECISAP deliverables         (software,   tapes,   operating   and
                 programming handbooks).
                 6.30.7.3.1.1.4. Studies and surveys (to include travel).
                 6.30.7.3.1.1.5. ECISAP-related Country Standard Technical Orders (CSTO).
      6.30.7.4. Preparation of LOA.
         6.30.7.4.1. In preparing an ECISAP case, it is important to develop case lines using
         the appropriate Line Manager Code (LMC), Operating Agency Code (OAC), and
         MASL as specified below.
             6.30.7.4.1.1. For LOAD provided by AFLCMC/WNYI, establish case lines with
             LMC of C7 and OAC of 47.
             6.30.7.4.1.2. For LOAD provided by ACC/A3TS, establish case lines with LMC
             of F1 and OAC of 78.
             6.30.7.4.1.3. For LOAD provided by HQ USAF establish case lines with LMC of
             B1 or B2 and OAC of 47. HQ USAF has requested that AFSAC manage its
             ECISAP case lines.
             6.30.7.4.1.4. Use MASLs as indicated below for the case lines:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 107


                  6.30.7.4.1.4.1. MASL (R9A)0791000EC1SAP for ECISAP-related services.
                  6.30.7.4.1.4.2. MASL (J7J)709Z00DATPROC for ECISAP software product-
                  related deliverables.
                  6.30.7.4.1.4.3. MASL (J8A)768ZB00KSPUBS for ECISAP-related CSTOs.
                  6.30.7.4.1.4.4. MASL (R4A)0074000STDSRVY(N)              for   “Studies   and
                  Surveys” to include travel.
   6.30.8. Travel and management cases are described in AFMAN 16-101.
   6.30.9. ILCS Cases.
       6.30.9.1. Introduction. The ILCS is developed and managed by the AFSAC as a “Q”
       case; follow-on support is to be written as a “G” case or “Q” case.
       6.30.9.2. Preparation of LOAD. Upon receipt of a SA country initial requirement for
       ILCS telecommunications, the AFSAC case manager will request LOAD from DLA
       Transaction Services with an information copy of the request to AFLCMC/WFS. Note:
       The LOAD coordinator located in AFLCMC/WFI (International) does not task DLA
       Transaction Services for this information.
   6.30.10. Aircraft ferry services.
6.31. “H” Cases—D/O Cases for Transportation Services. “H” cases provide transportation
services (except ferry services) to move articles through the DTS from the point of origin or
entry into US/DoD custody to a designated location. B/O cases are not appropriate for
transportation cases. Additional guidance is in AFMAN 16-101, Chapter 7.
6.32. “K” Cases—CLSSA. “K” cases are described in Section 6G.
6.33. “L” Cases—D/O Cases for Equipment. “L” cases, formerly used for D/O equipment
cases, are now written as “E” B/O cases with the individual items listed in the notes section of
the LOA when specified in the LOR.
6.34. “M” Cases—D/O and B/O Cases for Depot Level Maintenance. Guidelines for
processing maintenance cases are in Chapter 9.
6.35. “N” Cases—Special Support. “N” Cases are for multi-command and/or special services.
These cases include complex technical assistance, complex training, intelligence programs,
exercises, aircraft ferry, etc.
   6.35.1. AFSAC will:
       6.35.1.1. Receive the LOR from the customer for setting up the LOA.
       6.35.1.2. Prepare the LOA and send to the customer for signature.
       6.35.1.3. Maintain a signed copy of the LOA and ensure the LOA is issued.
       6.35.1.4. Forward the IPD to responsible line manager(s).
6.36. “O” Cases—B/O and D/O Cases for COMSEC.
   6.36.1. “O” cases include all types of actions involving COMSEC or cryptological items,
   except those items included in a major system sale. Basic guidance is in the DSCA Manual
   5105.38-M;, National COMSEC Instruction (NACSI) 6001(C), Foreign Military Sales of
 108                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   Communications Security and Services to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations; and AFMAN 16-101. Requests for major end items are sent to the National
   Security Agency (NSA).
   6.36.2. The customer sends the LOR to SAF/IA for items within the scope of annexes B and
   C of NACSI 6001, Foreign Military Sales of Communications Security Articles and Services
   to Foreign Governments and International Organizations. Requests for items within the
   scope of annex “A” are sent to the United States Army Security Assistance Command
   (USASAC).
   6.36.3. Pricing studies are sent to AFLCMC/HNC (Crypto Systems) with an information
   copy for AFSAC. AFLCMC/HNC sends the pricing studies data back to AFSAC.
   6.36.4. AFSAC prepares the LOA and forwards it to AFLCMC/HNC.
   6.36.5. AFSAC will:
       6.36.5.1. Input the case in SAMIS.
       6.36.5.2. Send an IPD to AFLCMC/HNC telling them that OA is available.
       6.36.5.3. Input, if necessary, requisitions and send referral orders to AFLCMC/HNC.
   6.36.6. The majority of the cases are B/O with the FMS customer submitting the
   requisitions. Some cases are D/O and the AFSAC case manager inputs requisitions.
   6.36.7. Maintenance cases are custom committed. The funds document control number
   notices are sent to AFLCMC/HNC. More information on custom commitment transactions is
   in Section 6D.
6.37. “R” Cases—B/O Spare-Parts Cases.
   6.37.1. “R” cases are usually set up to order spare parts of US origin and may have an
   ordering period of up to two years. This case sets the dollar value for items that the customer
   requisitions during the period of the case. Usually, only one “R” case is necessary for each
   customer. The AF encourages the customer to use CLSSA for follow-on spares support.
   6.37.2. AFSAC:
       6.37.2.1. Receives the LOR from the customer with the requested dollar-value for setting
       up the LOA.
       6.37.2.2. Prepares the LOA, establishes a case record in SAMIS, and sends the LOA to
       the customer for signature.
       6.37.2.3. Receives a signed copy of the LOA and makes sure OA is issued.
       6.37.2.4. Notifies the customer by message that requisitioning can start.
6.38. “T” Cases—Training. “T” cases apply to all types of training, including formal courses,
familiarization or qualification training, aircrew training, professional training, mobile training
teams, engineering technical services, and other technical or specialists training. More
information is in AFMAN 16-101, Chapters 7 and 10.
6.39. “U” Cases—Military Assistance Program (MAP).
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  109


   6.39.1. “U” cases are reserved by the AF to track Section 506 drawdowns and similar non-
   FMS SA GA transactions.
   6.39.2. “U” case designators are used to control new GA Record Control Numbers (RCN)
   received on a MAP order and 506A-drawdown action. They are used for internal SAMIS
   processing and identification. More information on processing is found in Chapter 7 of this
   manual.
6.40. “V” Cases—B/O and Defined Order Cases for Class IV Modifications.
   6.40.1. Class IV modifications include safety of flight, mission essential, and logistics type
   modifications. “V” cases can also include AF or contractor services (installation); however,
   installation is best done through an “M” case.
   6.40.2. The AF encourages the use of B/O cases to reduce administrative processing and
   speed delivery. The customer may ask for a D/O case, but increased processing time and
   possible increase in costs may result. For safety of flight modifications, the delayed receipt
   of kits may cause hazardous operating conditions.
   6.40.3. Pricing guidelines are in Chapter 5 and DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15. Pricing
   studies are not necessary for B/O “V” cases; however, if installation by the AF is needed, a
   manpower availability study is made.
   6.40.4. Approved Class IV A (safety) modification requirements which have an application
   to FMS systems and equipment are sent immediately by message to all affected FMS
   customer air attaches or designated representative for review and acquisition through
   established channels.
   6.40.5. Class IV B (mission essential) and Class IV C (logistics) modifications for FMS
   modification requirements are sent within five days after configuration control board
   approval.
6.41. “X” Cases—Holding Accounts and Financial Projects. An “X” case is used only by
DFAS for management purposes with SAF/IA approval. No LOA is prepared (see DoD
7000.14-R, Volume 15).
6.42. “Z” Case—Special Management (Non-FMS). A “Z” case is used for management
control of leases under the AECA, Chapter 6, or for actions not governed by the AECA but for
which similar procedures and controls are desirable (i.e., leases under Title 10 United States
Code (USC), Section 2667). Reference Chapter 8.

Section 6G—COOPERATIVE LOGISTICS SUPPLY SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS
(CLSSA)

6.43. Background.
   6.43.1. The AF provides FMS spares support to eligible countries through initial support
   packages and follow-on support cases.
       6.43.1.1. An initial spares package is used to establish in-country operating stocks.
       Operating stocks are depot and base stocks used to maintain the weapon system on a day-
       to-day basis. Initial support is provided through an LOA that includes the weapon system
       (e.g., F-16, C-130) and the support necessary (e.g., spares, SE, technical assistance,
 110                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       training) to establish an in-country operational capability. Initial support LOAs are
       identified by “D,” “Q,” “S,” or “Y” case designators.
       6.43.1.2. Follow-on support begins with the operation of the weapon system. Follow-on
       support is necessary to replenish operating stocks as they are used to maintain the weapon
       system. As items become unserviceable through use, they may be repaired or replaced.
       This requires both repair and procurement actions. There are three different types of
       FMS follow-on spares cases. All three can be for both repair and procurement:
          6.43.1.2.1. A D/O case is written for specific items and quantities.
          6.43.1.2.2. A B/O case is written for a dollar value. Requisitions can be submitted up
          to the dollar value of the case.
          6.43.1.2.3. The CLSSA program is a method for customer countries to become a
          partner in the US logistics system, and to obtain spares support in a timely manner.
6.44. Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangement (CLSSA) Overview.
   6.44.1. During peacetime conditions, a CLSSA is the normal means for providing follow-on
   logistics support for equipment of U.S. origin that is in allied or friendly country inventories.
   Under CLSSA procedures participating countries "buy into" the DoD inventory. Recurring
   CLSSA demands for secondary items shall be included in the computational system for
   forecasting CLSSA requirements. Assets shall be both stocked and maintained on order from
   procurement in anticipation of FMS country requisitions.
   6.44.2. When assets are transferred under matured CLSSAs, the sales are made from DoD
   inventory financed by CLSSA funds, and the materiel cost shall be reimbursable at full stock
   list price.
   6.44.3. Materiel sold through FMS under matured CLSSAs shall be given equal treatment
   with USAF requisitions (within F/AD) for on-hand and on-order depot stocks.
   6.44.4. Materiel requests received prior to maturation of the CLSSA are considered non-
   programmed requirements. Materiel may be released, but not normally below the control
   level to fill non-programmed requirements.
   6.44.5. On an exception basis, materiel may be transferred from stocks below the control
   level to fill CLSSA requirements if release of the stocks will not adversely affect the support
   of U.S. Forces (such issues shall not be below the safety level).
   6.44.6. Requirements. When a CLSSA participant becomes a partner in the AF and DLA
   supply systems, the participant will:
       6.44.6.1. Forecast spares requirements in advance.
       6.44.6.2. Invest in the AF and DLA supply systems to allow the forecasted requirements
       to be bought in anticipation of future requisitions. The CLSSA participant's requisitions
       are then eligible to be filled from a combined pool of US and CLSSA assets.
   6.44.7. A CLSSA program requires two FMS cases: the stock-level case (FMSO I) and the
   requisition case (FMSO II).
       6.44.7.1. Stock-Level Case (FMSO I). The customer's spares requirements, financial
       liability, and financial investment in the AF and DLA supply systems are defined in the
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                     111


      FMSO I case. The customer is financially liable for all of the FMSO I-defined
      requirements. Its financial investment, however, is either 5/17th’s (FMSO I case
      established prior to 2005) or 30 percent (FMSO I case established after 2005) of the total
      liability. It is the customer's financial liability and 5/17th (or 30 percent) investment that
      gives the AF and DLA the authority to buy and store assets in anticipation of the CLSSA
      customer's future requisitions.
      6.44.7.2. Requisition Case (FMSO II). The customer's requisitions for CLSSA I
      requirements are submitted on the FMSO II case. Requisitions for eligible FMSO I items
      will receive support equal to the AF within the F/AD. (Items that meet the FMSO II
      eligibility criteria, but not the FMSO I criteria, may be requisitioned on the FMSO II
      case, but they will not be coded programmed and are not eligible for preferred treatment.)
   6.44.8. Programmed CLSSA requisitions are entitled to support within the F/AD equal to
   that provided to AF requisitions. The CLSSA program does not guarantee that all eligible
   CLSSA requisitions will be filled immediately from depot stocks. Not all AF requisitions are
   filled immediately from depot stocks. Not all AF requisitions are filled immediately from
   depot stocks. AFSAC continually monitors the quality of support provided by the supply
   system. Statistics showing the quality of support CLSSA requisitions receive are available
   on AFSAC On-Line (AOL), with required AOL username /password at the AFSAC Metrics
   link (https://afsac.wpafb.af.mil/).
   6.44.9. CLSSA is designed for US-depot-to-country-depot support. It is not intended to
   provide direct support for on-line operational aircraft. To achieve the best weapon system
   operational rate, in-country depot and base operating stocks should be maintained.
   6.44.10. The AF must recover all costs associated with FMS customer use of the DoD
   supply systems.
   6.44.11. One-time DCSA approval is required for an FMS customer to participate in
   CLSSA. Once approval is given, AFSAC manages all aspects of a country’s CLSSA
   program.
   6.44.12. Losses to stored stocks in AF facilities from natural disaster or enemy action will be
   assessed proportionately against the US and the FMS customer.
6.45. FMSO I / Stock-Level Case.
   6.45.1. General Requirements. FMSO I:
      6.45.1.1. Defines the customer's follow-on spares requirements to be held on-hand or on-
      order by the AF and DLA. Materiel is bought to support the customer's CLSSA
      requirements and it becomes an integral part of the U.S. inventory. It is not physically
      segregated nor accounted for separately from other US stocks.
      6.45.1.2. Provides the AF and DLA the authority to buy and store materiel in
      anticipation of the CLSSA customer's requisitions.
      6.45.1.3. Provides the AFSAC SAMIS the capability to determine which requisitions are
      eligible to be filled from depot stocks. Requisitions for items and quantities forecast on
      the FMSO I are coded “Programmed” — eligible for support from depot stocks.
      Requisitions for items or quantities not forecast on the FMSO I are coded “Non-
      programmed” — not eligible for support from depot stock.
112                                                   AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.45.1.4. Serves as the basis for the customer's financial investment in the US supply
      system.
  6.45.2. Item Eligibility and Exclusions.
      6.45.2.1. Only spares and repair parts stocked by the AF and DLA are eligible for
      inclusion on the FMSO I stock-level case. The types of spares and repair parts are:
         6.45.2.1.1. AF-managed investment (reparable) items (ERRC “T”).
         6.45.2.1.2. AF-managed expense items (ERRC “N” and “P”).

         6.45.2.2.18. Requisitions for shelf life NSNs with requisition transaction advice
         codes 2G, 23, 24, 29 and 31 will be rejected with an “F6” as ineligible for FMSO II.
  6.45.3. Management Categories. FMSO I spares requirements are grouped into different
  categories for management purposes. Note: Do not confuse repair/replace with repair/return
  which is not a CLSSA support process. The different management categories are:
      6.45.3.1. AF Investment (Reparable) Items — Procurement (Type AA).
         6.45.3.1.1. When an item is required in country, the country may either purchase a
         condition code “A” asset or exchange a broken reparable part for a serviceable part.
         To purchase an item without sending a reparable part, the customer submits a
         requisition for the item.
         6.45.3.1.2. SAMIS will compute FMSO I investment item “procurement” stock
         levels (Type AA) based on FMSO II cases’ recurring, non-Repair/Replace
         (Exchange) requisitions received in the past four years. (Reference paragraph 6.8
         for a description of the different types of FMS requisitions)
      6.45.3.2. AF Investment (Reparable) Items — Repair/Replace (Type AB).
         6.45.3.2.1. When an item is required in country, the country may either purchase a
         new part or exchange a broken part for a serviceable. To exchange an item,
         repair/replace may be used. Upon return of an approved reparable carcass, SAMIS
         creates a replacement A01 due-out requisition with an “H”-coded serial number.
         6.45.3.2.2. SAMIS will compute FMSO I investment item “repair” stock levels
         (Type AB) based on FMSO II cases’ H-coded requisitions processed in the past four
         years.
      6.45.3.3. AF Expense Items (Type BB). SAMIS will compute FMSO I AF expense item
      stock.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 115


      6.45.3.4. DLA Expense Items (Type CC). SAMIS will compute FMSO I DLA expense
      item stock.
      6.45.3.5. Liability File Items. SAMIS recomputes FMSO I stock levels quarterly.
      Excess FMSO I stock levels, for which there is a stock level of at least one FMS
      customer, are moved to the Liability File. Both AF investment and expense items are
      processed through the liability file. DLA expense items that appear in the Liability File
      will remain there until all other CLSSA country’s stock levels are reduced to zero. DLA
      items financial liability are zero when they are in the Liability File.
      6.45.3.6. Termination File Items. Excess FMSO I AF items (Types AA, AB, and BB)
      for which there is Stock Level Quantity for each FMS customer are moved to the
      Termination File. The purpose of the Termination File is to identify and clear excess
      FMSO I items, their respective liability based on country. Both investment (Type AA
      and AB) and expense (Type BB) items are processed through the Termination File. DLA
      items (Type CC) never move to the Termination File.
   6.45.4. Interchangeable and Substitutable (I&S) master NSN. SAMIS automatically updates
   the SAMIS catalog I&S master when there is a change in the SAMIS catalog source data
   (that source is D043). Note: AF I&S may not always be the same as the other Services if
   they use the same NSN.
6.46. FMSO I Case Development Overview.
   6.46.1. FMSO I stock levels can be established in four ways:
      6.46.1.1. Recurring Requisitions on an Existing FMSO II Case. Primarily, FMSO I
      stock levels are based on customer FMSO II recurring requisitions (“R” in rp 44 of the
      requisition). If the item being ordered is eligible to be “programmed,” SAMIS will force
      an “R” in rp 44 to make it a recurring demand. Recurring FMSO II case requisitions:
          6.46.1.1.1. Are eligible to be coded “programmed.” (Programmed requisitions are
          eligible for support from depot stocks.)
          6.46.1.1.2. Are used to compute the FMSO I stock levels which are re-computed the
          next quarter.
              6.46.1.1.2.1. SAMIS will compute FMSO I repair stock levels based on
              repair/replace (H-coded) requisitions that process on the FMSO II case. All H-
              coded requisitions on FMSO II cases are coded recurring if they meet the eligible
              to be programmed stock level edit. Note: The repair stock level is not for repair;
              it is to augment AFMC stocks to support the repair pipeline. Also, it is to allow
              the IM to buy stocks in advance of receiving H-coded requisitions, so the
              requisitions can be filled in a timely manner. (See paragraph 6.8 for a
              description of the different types of FMS requisitions.)
              6.46.1.1.2.2. SAMIS will compute FMSO I procurement stock levels based on
              recurring non-repair/replace (non H-coded) requisitions that process on the FMSO
              II case. These are normal A01 requisitions submitted by the customer on a FMSO
              II case. SAMIS will compute procurement stock levels for both investment and
              expense items.
116                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.46.1.2. Initial CLSSA Program — Overview. When a customer first joins CLSSA,
      there is no demand history for SAMIS to use to compute stock levels, so the following
      process is used:
         6.46.1.2.1. The FMS customer provides the AFSAC CM with the weapon system
         O&M data for the weapon system to be supported through CLSSA. This would
         include similar parameters to what the AF would use for setting up a new base of
         operations. The AFLCMC Weapon System Manager using the O&M data, identifies
         the appropriate NSNs and quantities (for a 24-month sustainment), and provides them
         to the AFSAC CM. If time and resources permit, it is a useful practice to, if practical,
         obtain two recommendations for comparison purposes: one from the system manager
         and one from the system sale spare parts case/line.
             6.46.1.2.1.1. The AFSAC CM provides this data in spreadsheet form to the
             AFSAC CLSSA PMO with a courtesy copy to the FMSO I Case Manager.
             6.46.1.2.1.2. The CLSSA PMO inputs the O&M data into the AFSAC On-Line
             “CLSSA Reporting Major Add Part I Application.” It produces a CLSSA
             Recommended Items Listing (also known as the preliminary “Equity List”) that is
             provided to the country. This list is returned to the AFSAC CM with additional
             guidance to provide to Country.
         6.46.1.2.2. The AFSAC CM sends this “Recommended Item Listing” to the customer
         for modification and/or approval. The NSN and quantities indicated are the
         recommended “quarterly” demand quantities.
         6.46.1.2.3. The customer reviews the listing and makes desired changes to the
         “adjusted quantities” (a reduction to zero will remove the item from the listing). The
         customer may also add NSNs and quantities only on a separate Excel spreadsheet.
         The customer may only make “adjusted quantity” changes to the original listing.
             6.46.1.2.3.1. The changes and additions, if any, are returned to AFSAC and are
             used to produce an updated listing. This process may repeat several times. The
             AFSAC CLSSA PMO will use the AFSAC On-Line “CLSSA Reporting Major
             Add Part II to update the “Recommended Item Listing.” Note: The difference
             between Part I and Part II is that the initial 24-month quantities are changed in
             Phase I to reflect a quantity based on the items lead time. The Part II application
             does not affect quantities and only calculates FMSO I eligibility.
             6.46.1.2.3.2. Each time a new list is produced, the data is based on the current
             SAMIS catalog logistics cataloging data which may change to include pricing,
             especially if the updated listing is produced after 1 October. SAMIS catalog
             pricing is updated on at the start of the FY.
             6.46.1.2.3.3. After the customer is satisfied with their “Recommended Item
             Listing,” it is submitted to the AFSAC FMSO I Case Manager with a LOR for the
             appropriate FMSO I LOR/LOA process. A copy of this “Recommended Item
             Listing” is provided to the AFSAC CLSSA PMO. After the LOA is accepted and
             implemented, this final “Recommended Item Listing” items and quantities are
             loaded into a Maturation File in SAMIS, where they are included in subsequent
             requirements computation passes to USAF but are not used to code requisitions as
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  117


              programmed until the maturation time period is completed. DLA (Type CC)
              items do not need a maturation time period and are available to be programmed
              (subject to EPQ edits) immediately and also subject to EPQ edits. Note: The
              AFSAC CLSSA PMO will use the AFSAC On-Line “CLSSA Reporting Major
              Add Part III application to load the finalized “Recommended Item Listing” into
              the SAMIS Maturation File.
              6.46.1.2.3.4. Once the “Recommended Item Listing” items and quantities have
              been loaded into the Maturation File, it becomes the FMSO I “Equity List.”
          6.46.1.2.4. The FMSO I LOA is written using the values from the updated listing.
      6.46.1.3. Major Add — Overview.
          6.46.1.3.1. A “Major Add” is the addition of a new weapon system to an existing
          FMSO I. It can also be an increase to an existing FMSO I weapon system (i.e., a
          country buys 12 F-16s and they already own 24 F-16s). In both instances, for the
          additional requirement, there is no demand history for SAMIS to use to compute
          stock levels, so the process described above is used.
          6.46.1.3.2. An amendment to the FMSO I LOA is prepared to add the new system
          and requirements to FMSO I. Use the process above outlined starting in paragraph
          6.46.1.2, Initial CLSSA Program.
      6.46.1.4. Manual Adjustments. The customer may notify AFSAC of increases or
      decreases that will require an immediate change in their stock levels. This is
      accomplished semi-manually (manual entry with SAMIS automatically performing the
      updates/changes) through SAMIS system processes. There are some considerations; they
      are:
          6.46.1.4.1. Items removed or decreased should not be again requisitioned or a new
          stock level will be created.
          6.46.1.4.2. Normal liability and termination procedures will apply. AF items added
          or quantities increased will be required to go through a maturation period before
          being available for programmed support.
          6.46.1.4.3. The process to accomplish removal of items from the FMSO I is available
          on AFSAC On-Line under “CLSSA Reporting” and its use is restricted to the FMSO
          I Case Manager and the AFSAC CLSSA PMO. Any removal of items is restricted to
          AF items. Additionally, if a country is requesting removal of AF items that show a
          demand history, the only recourse is termination with an immediate drawdown action.
          Should a country create subsequent demands for these items, SAMIS will determine
          eligibility and if necessary add them back to the FMSO I (which will increase the
          FMSO I Value). Note: DLA Items (Type CC) in the Liability file will not be deleted
          as they do not add any financial liability to the FMSO I Case.
6.47. FMSO I Initial and Major-Add Program Processing Concept.
   6.47.1. When a customer first joins CLSSA, the requirements it adds to the CLSSA program
   are called its initial program. The addition of requirements for a new weapon system, or the
   addition of requirements for more of an existing weapon system, to an established FMSO I is
   called a major add. There are three different ways to develop an initial or major add CLSSA
118                                                       AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


  program: an AFLCMC Weapon System Manager recommendation, a recommendation based
  solely on customer-provided data, or if there is a system sales case, the items/quantities
  placed on order (only within the previous four years) may be used. Usually the PM’s
  recommendation is the most accurate. Note: TCTO actions, NSN replacements,
  cancellations, etc. are reason for using the most current and accurate data.
  6.47.2. If the PM recommendation method is used, the following applies:
      6.47.2.1. The FMS customer identifies (to the AFSAC CM) the weapon system to be
      supported by Mission Design Series (MDS) (e.g., F-16), the number of aircraft (e.g., 12),
      Flying Hour Program (FHP) (e.g., 15 sorties per month at two hours per sortie), number
      of operating sites (e.g., two main operating bases, one forward operating base), installed
      equipment, and the maintenance concept (e.g., Organizational and Intermediate [O&I]
      maintenance in-country). If the end item is spares such as a radio set, the customer will
      give the number of operating hours and number of sites for ground sets, or the number of
      aircraft and FHP for airborne sets. Requests for engine spares will include engine
      operating hours.
      6.47.2.2. The AFSAC CM will send the customer-provided operational and maintenance
      requirements to the AFLCMC Weapon System Manager and ask for a two-year support
      recommendation – range and depth of items provided in an Excel spreadsheet:
         6.47.2.2.1. A 24-month investment (ERRC “T”) item procurement range and depth
         spares recommendation. This recommendation is to be based on the condemnation
         rate of the spares.
         6.47.2.2.2. A 24-month investment (ERRC “T”) item — repair range and depth
         spares recommendation. This recommendation is to be based on the Not Reparable
         This Station (NRTS) rate of the spares.
         6.47.2.2.3. A 24-month consumable item (ERRCs “N” & “P”) range and depth
         spares recommendation. This recommendation is to be based on the condemnation
         rate of the spares.
      6.47.2.3. This PM/AFLCMC Weapon System Manager produced data will be used by
      the AFSAC CLSSA PMO to develop the CLSSA Recommended Items List.
         6.47.2.3.1. Items applicable to the weapon system(s), subsystem(s), end article(s),
         etc., are to be considered for inclusion in the recommendation.
         6.47.2.3.2. The PM recommendation should be conservative. This is to preclude
         establishing stock-level requirements that may never be needed. Once the
         conservative stock level is established on the FMSO I, it will be automatically
         adjusted by SAMIS based on actual customer demand patterns.
         6.47.2.3.3. The following are possible sources that may be used in compiling a
         recommendation. All sources of information available will be considered.
             6.47.2.3.3.1. Application files from the D200A, Secondary Item Requirements
             System (SIRS).
             6.47.2.3.3.2. Initial spares requirements.
             6.47.2.3.3.3. Preliminary group assembly parts lists.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   119


            6.47.2.3.3.4. MRRL.
            6.47.2.3.3.5. Recoverable Item Breakdown (RIB).
            6.47.2.3.3.6. International Weapon Item Projection System (IWIPS).
        6.47.2.3.4. The recommendation data is to be provided in an Excel file spreadsheet.
        The AFLCMC Weapon System Manager recommendation should be returned to the
        AFSAC CM who will forward it to the AFSAC CLSSA PMO with a copy to the
        FMSO I case manager.
     6.47.2.4. AFSAC will use the new recommendation process programs in AFSAC On-
     Line to process the recommendation data.
        6.47.2.4.1. These AOL programs will produce the “CLSSA Recommendation
        Listing” . The produced “CLSSA Recommendation Listing” will show FMSO I
        eligible CLSSA items, FMSO II eligible CLSSA items, and ineligible items not
        orderable on a FMSO II case
        6.47.2.4.2. The “CLSSA Recommendation Listing” will include stock level
        recommended quantities computed using the formula: Average Monthly Demand
        (AMD) times the actual lead time of the item. The AMD is computed using the 24-
        month AFLCMC Weapon System Manager provided recommended items and
        quantities. The process programs will include the worldwide stock levels on the
        “CLSSA Recommendation Listing” for comparison purposes.
        6.47.2.4.3. The AFSAC CM will send the listings provided by the AFSAC CLSSA
        PMO to the country for review and adjustment.
     6.47.2.5. The CLSSA customer makes an item-by-item review of the “CLSSA
     Recommendation Listing” comparing the recommended quantities against the worldwide
     stock level quantities. The customer makes any desired changes to the “adjusted
     quantity” only. The spreadsheet formatting is not to be changed. Any additional NSNs
     are to be provided on a separate spreadsheet or in a text file. “Picture” (i.e., PDF) files
     will not be accepted for additions. If there are any deletions to the “CLSSA
     Recommendation Listing,” just change the adjusted quantity to a zero. The CLSSA
     Recommendation listing” Excel spreadsheet and any additional data is returned to the
     AFSAC CM who will in turn forward it to the AFSAC CLSSA PMO with a coy to the
     FMSO I case manager.
  6.47.3. Initial and Major Add Processing Using AFSAC On-Line
     6.47.3.1. Process the initial listing (regardless of source) to: edit for FMSO I eligibility,
     conversion to stock level quantity, and comparison with existing worldwide Levels. Add
     appropriate catalog data elements and compute stock level value using FMSO I price. If
     DLA items are not provided, the FMSO I value is increased by 25 percent to cover DLA
     items. The end result for this phase of the process is to have an Excel spreadsheet with
     all appropriate data elements. This allows a country to easily modify the spreadsheet.
        6.47.3.1.1. After receiving the “CLSSA Recommendation Listing” from the
        AFLCMC Weapon System Manager, only two pieces of data are needed: the NSN
        and the recommended quantity.
120                                                  AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.47.3.1.2. Create a new spreadsheet (this will be the “input file”’) with the following
      columns:
         6.47.3.1.2.1. Recommendation Time Frame,
         6.47.3.1.2.2. Country Code,
         6.47.3.1.2.3. FMSO I Case,
         6.47.3.1.2.4. Input Type,
         6.47.3.1.2.5. NIIN, and
         6.47.3.1.2.6. Recommended Quantity.
      6.47.3.1.3. Populate the above columns with the following values:
         6.47.3.1.3.1. “24,”
         6.47.3.1.3.2. Two Character Country Code,
         6.47.3.1.3.3. Assigned FMSO I Case i.e. “KAA,”
         6.47.3.1.3.4. Use “N” for the first pass and “H” for the second pass,
         6.47.3.1.3.5. NIIN only (not the NSN), and
         6.47.3.1.3.6. Quantity with leading zeros for a total of six positions i.e. “000015.”
         Note: Column data for 5 and 6 come from the recommendation list in step
         6.48.3.1.1. above. The “N” tells the program to compute purchase quantities and
         assign Type “AA” to the NSN based on the SOS. The “H” does essentially the
         same thing except assigns Type “AB” to the same items if there is a depot repair
         capability only, not contract repair. Types “BB” and “CC” are not affected by the
         “N” or “H” when processed.
      6.47.3.1.4. Once this “input file” is fully populated it must be sorted by NIIN so the
      input listing and output listing can be easily compared to see if the program captured
      all of the NIINs. The input file is input into the AFSAC On-Line “CLSSA Reporting
      Major Add Part I.”
         6.47.3.1.4.1. Do this by selecting the column A, line 1 (Time Frame) through
         column F, line 2000 (quantity) cells. Copy these lines into the AFSAC On-Line
         “CLSSA Reporting Major Add Part I input screen and press “Submit.”
         6.47.3.1.4.2. The program will take about a minute to produce a Spreadsheet with
         three tabs. Tab 1 is the Recommended Items list; tab 2 is the list of items that are
         FMSO II eligible, but not FMSO I eligible; and tab 3 lists items that are not
         FMSO I or FMSO II eligible (CLSSA ineligible).
         6.47.3.1.4.3. Check the input file list for the NIIN on the last line that was entered
         into the program against the last NIIN on each of the three tabs. If there is a
         match, all of the input file data has been processed. If not, then it is simpler to
         reduce the number of lines in the input file until there is a match (which means
         repeat paragraph 6.48.3.1.4.1 step with a lower number of lines).
         6.47.3.1.4.4. Repeat paragraphs 6.47.3.1.4.1. and 6.47.3.1.4.2. steps as many
         times as required until the input file is depleted and all items have been processed.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  121


             6.47.3.1.4.5. Consolidate all of the spreadsheets into one large spreadsheet
             keeping the tabs intact. This will result in a very large tab 1 with smaller tabs 2
             and 3. Sort only tab 1 on “TYPE,” “FSC,” and “NIIN.”
                6.47.3.1.4.5.1. Format the spreadsheet and add formulae to total the different
                types, percentage for fees, initial deposit, and total value. Also, there are two
                columns that must be in red: the adjusted quantity and adjusted FMSO I
                value.
                  6.47.3.1.4.5.1.1. Column “N” (Adjusted FMSO I Value) must have a
                  formula (for each line that has data) that multiplies the Adjusted Quantity in
                  column “K” against the FMSO I price in column “L.” This is so when the
                  customer adjusts the quantity it will also change the FMSO I value. It will
                  look something like this: TOTAL AA; 2,694,079.70.
                  6.47.3.1.4.5.1.2. Ensure there are six blank lines separating the “Types.”
                  Two lines after the last line of data for each type, enter the word “Total” in
                  the NIIN column, enter the type (i.e., AA, AB, etc.) for that column in the
                  CLSSA Type column and under the FMSO I Value and Adjusted FMSO I
                  Value columns do a “sum.”
                  6.47.3.1.4.5.1.3. Do this for each Type AA, AB, BB, and CC. At the
                  bottom, sum all of the sections and add the fees and initial deposit. It will
                  look something like this:

Table 6.7. Recommended Item Listing
Formulae Entries                        Amounts
Total AA                                 1,228,641.02
Total AB                                   297,247.84
Total BB                                   206,580.70

Total Recommendation LOA Value           2,404,684.61
Total Amount Due for Implementation        746,281.43
                  6.47.3.1.4.5.1.4. Once accomplished, this spreadsheet becomes the
                  “Recommended Item Listing” and is provided to the AFSAC CM along with
                  a simple guide for the customer to follow when making adjustments to the
                  “Recommended Item Listing.” This “Recommended Item Listing” must be
                  returned with only “Adjusted Quantity” changes and no formatting or
                  additional formulae entries in the cells. To remove an item, change the
                  quantity to zero and any additions must be provided on a separate
                  spreadsheet. These will be combined into the final “Recommended Item
                  Listing” which will eventually become the “Equity List” attached to the
 122                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


                    FMSO I Case LOA.
6.48. FMSO I Computations.
   6.48.1. The FMSO I is a demand based process. SAMIS automatically computes Stock
   Level Quantity (SLQ), Stock Level Values, and Eligible-to-be-Programmed Quantities
   (EPQ) based on customer recurring FMSO II demand.
       6.48.1.1. The FMSO I SLQ is the customer’s total FMSO I requirement for an NSN.
       6.48.1.2. The EPQ is that portion of the SLQ that SAMIS uses to code requisitions as
       programmed (eligible for support from depot stocks).
   6.48.2. FMSO I SLQ Computation. The FMSO I stock levels and case values are based on
   four factors: the average FMSO II case monthly demand; the lead time of the item; any
   initial/major-add quantities; and the current FMSO I price.
       6.48.2.1. FMSO I procurement and repair stock levels are valued using the current
       FMSO I price.
       6.48.2.2. SLQ Computation. The CLSSA stock levels are computed by SAMIS.
          6.48.2.2.1. For the repair stock level, the formula is: average daily demand for
          repair/replace (H-coded) requisitions times the repair time of the item, in days.
          6.48.2.2.2. For investment, procurement, and expense item stock levels, the formula
          is: AMD times the PLT of the item (in months). The PLT will range from one to 60
          months. See Attachment 7 for a detailed example of the SLQ computation process.
          6.48.2.2.3. Initial/Major-Add Program Processing. SAMIS will maintain initial and
          major add program quantities for a one to two year (normally) maturity period based
          on lead times and computed from the date the NSN/quantities are established in
          SAMIS. During this period, maturity file quantities will be added to the
          computations listed above. At the conclusion of the maturity period, SAMIS will
          incorporate the initial/major add levels into the normal stock level program records,
          and will also create pseudo-demand history records that will result in a future stock
          level computation that equals the program initial/major add quantities as adjusted by
          actual requisitions. Once this occurs, normal stock level, liability and termination file
          processing occurs.
   6.48.3. FMSO I Stock Level Value Computation. The stock-level value is computed as the
   SLQ times the FMSO I price.
   6.48.4. EPQ Computation.
       6.48.4.1. The worldwide EPQ is used by SAMIS in coding recurring FMSO II case
       requisitions as programmed (eligible for support from depot stock). SAMIS will code
       eligible requisitions as programmed if the requisition quantity is less than or equal to the
       worldwide EPQ.
       6.48.4.2. There is only one worldwide repair EPQ, and one worldwide procurement EPQ
       for each investment item NSN. AF consumable items have one procurement EPQ per
       NSN. CLSSA customers do not have their own EPQ. (SAMIS computes individual
       country EPQ amounts and then adds them together to determine the worldwide EPQ.)
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 123


      6.48.4.3. SAMIS re-computes SLQ and worldwide EPQ every quarter. There will
      probably be more EPQ available on the first of the quarter than at the end of the quarter.
      As a result, requisitions submitted early in the quarter will have a better chance to be
      coded programmed.
      6.48.4.4. The EPQ is computed by SAMIS as one quarter’s demand plus any unused
      EPQ from previous quarters up to the total SLQ. For example:

Table 6.8. EPQ Computation Examples
Example      Dmd/Mo       PLT        SLQ      DMD/QTR        Unused EPQ          EPQ
   1            1         24 Mo        24        3                 0               3
   2            1         24 Mo        24        3                 2               5
          6.48.4.4.1. In example 1, one quarter’s demand is equal to three. Since there is no
          unused EPQ from the previous quarter, SAMIS can code requisitions programmed up
          to a quantity of three.
          6.48.4.4.2. Example 2 is the following quarter. SAMIS computes one quarter’s
          demand of three. In the previous quarter, SAMIS only received one recurring
          requisition for quantity one and only used one EPQ, leaving two unused. As a result,
          the current quarter’s EPQ is 5 (3+2). SAMIS can code requisitions programmed up to
          a quantity of five.
      6.48.4.5. Requisitions for quantities in excess of the worldwide EPQ will be coded non-
      programmed.
      6.48.4.6. The worldwide EPQ is not visible to the CLSSA customer.
      6.48.4.7. Any eligible FMSO II case’s recurring investment item requisition may be
      coded programmed by SAMIS if there is sufficient worldwide EPQ. This allows
      customers that do not have an SLQ to get programmed support for their recurring
      requisitions. It also allows customers to requisition amounts exceeding their SLQ and get
      programmed support. In both of these circumstances, the customer should requisition
      small quantities to take advantage of available worldwide EPQ. In both instances,
      SAMIS will compute/adjust the SLQ based on the customer’s recurring requisitions.
      6.48.4.8. Because of the worldwide EPQ concept, the IM may receive programmed
      requisitions from unexpected countries. The IM should not try to second-guess the
      programmed/non-programmed code in the requisition. IMs will support all programmed
      requisitions in the appropriate manner.
6.49. FMSO I Item Management.
   6.49.1. Background. The purpose of CLSSA is to identify future FMS customer
   requirements and to augment US depots stocks so that FMS requisitions can be supported
   with on-hand/on-order assets. The CLSSA customers are financially liable for forecasted
   requirements that are in the supply pipeline.
   6.49.2. SAMIS Item Management. SAMIS uses three files to project the CLSSA customer’s
   future requirements, and to manage the CLSSA customer's liability for the projected
   requirements. The three files are the: stock level, liability, and termination. The CLSSA
   participant is financially liable for all FMSO I items included in these three files.
124                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.49.2.1. The stock level file includes active repair and procurement stock levels for both
      reparable and consumable items. SAMIS computes stock levels for reparable and
      consumable items based on the FMS customer's recurring requisitions and actual lead
      times.
  6.49.3. The liability file is used to identify excess FMSO I reparable and consumable item
  requirements and to clear them from the FMSO I. When the repair or procurement stock
  levels decrease, the amount of decrease is moved to the liability file for processing. (See
  paragraph 6.51. for more detailed information.)
      6.49.3.1. An item can be removed from the liability file in one of three ways:
         6.49.3.2.1. Based on the NIIN, FMS non H-coded (non-repair/replace) requisitions
         that process through SAMIS will be used to remove items/quantities from the liability
         and termination files; thereby, clearing the CLSSA customer's liability. There is an
         exception to this process: requisitions with advice codes “6P” (new and unused),
         “BV,” “6V,” “6W” (sole source), “2C,” “2J,” “22,” “31,” “32,” and “33” (do not
         substitute) are not used to clear liability. This is because these codes do not allow the
         IM to consider all assets when filling the requisition. See Attachment 7 for a
         detailed example of this process and paragraph 6.8 for a description of the different
         types of FMS requisitions.
         6.49.3.2.2. Based on NIIN, any increase in a stock level will remove a corresponding
         item/quantity from the liability file. The increased stock level accounts for the
         liability for the removed item.
         6.49.3.2.3. When there is no stock level for an item for any FMS country, any
         remaining levels in the liability file are moved to the termination file.
      6.49.3.3. The termination file is used to track and clear excess FMSO I items and
      quantities when there is no FMSO I stock level for any country. The termination file is
      also used when an NSN becomes ineligible for the FMSO I. Items that become ineligible
      for the FMSO I due to catalog changes are moved to the termination file, and normal
      termination file processing occurs. (See paragraph 6.51 for more detailed information.)
         6.49.3.3.1. An item/quantity may remain in the termination file for up to two years.
         Every six months during those two years, SAMIS will route “CLSSA Termination
         Absorption Request” forms (U-W001.-GAV) to the inventory managers via the 430
         SCMS. The Inventory Managers will complete the forms using D200A and back
         order information. If this data indicates absorption is possible, SAMIS will remove
         the NSN/quantity from the termination file and clear customer liability. The
         requisition and stock level changes that apply to the liability file also apply to the
         termination file. Catalog changes that affect CLSSA eligibility and issuance and/or
         financial liability can also remove items from the termination file.
         6.49.3.3.2. After two years, drawdown requisitions will be used to remove the
         unabsorbed items/quantities from the termination file.           Skeleton drawdown
         requisitions will be created and the customer requested to provide the missing data for
         disposition of the unabsorbed items/quantities. Customer liability will then be
         resolved through normal drawdown requisition processing.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    125


6.50. FMSO I Levels in the Buy-Computation Systems.
   6.50.1. The CLSSA FMSO I stock level, liability, and termination file items are all
   accounted for in the buy computations.
       6.50.1.1. D200A.
           6.50.1.1.1. SAMIS passes the AF-managed FMSO I stock level items and quantities
           to D200A quarterly. D200A is used for both investment and expense spares (ERRCs
           “N,” “P” and “T”). The CLSSA stock levels are additive to the computed AF stock
           levels. The CLSSA levels are shown in D200A under the heading “FMS.”
           6.50.1.1.2. Quarterly, SAMIS passes a detailed listing of CLSSA D200A stock levels
           (CLSSA Requirements Listing Report W001.-GBK) to the 430 SCMS for distribution
           to the IMs.
           6.50.1.1.3. Liability and termination file items are included in the quarterly “FMS
           Retention Listing” passed to the IMs.
               6.50.1.1.3.1. When an item/quantity is moved from the stock level file to the
               liability/ termination file, it is no longer passed to D200A via the CLSSA pass,
               but it is added to the “FMS Retention Listing.” Note: SAMIS calculates the
               retention level as “the current yearly FMS demand rate times 18.5 years minus the
               CLSSA SLQ plus the liability and termination file quantities.” The retention
               level will vary due to changes in the yearly demand rate and changes in the
               liability and termination file quantities.
6.50.1.1.3.2. The IMs use this listing in manually adjusting their retention levels. The liability
and termination file items are included in the “FMS Retention Listing” because they are excess
FMSO I requirements. The IM will not buy any more to support these requirements, but should
not throw any assets away either until the CLSSA customer 's liability for the items is resolved.

               6.50.1.1.3.3. When the items/quantities are removed from the CLSSA pass, the
               D200A requirements will decrease (assuming no other changes). If this results in
               long supply stocks, they would show above the “Control Level” and be available
               to any FMS requisition. If long supply assets did not result, the assets would be
               required for other D200A requirements. This concept is the basis for SAMIS
               using FMS requisitions to clear customer liability. (See paragraph 6.51. for
               additional detail.)
       6.50.1.2. DLA.
           6.50.1.2.1. The DLA-buy-computation system is a demand-based system. Both DoD
           and CLSSA “K” case recurring demands are used to compute the buys.
           6.50.1.2.2. Since SAMIS and the DLA-buy-computation systems are both demand-
           driven. SAMIS will mirror DLA’s system for the FMS requirements. Both SAMIS
           and the DLA system will recognize decreasing demand. The DLA system will adjust
           its requirements level accordingly. SAMIS will lower its consumable-item stock
           levels accordingly.

6.51. FMSO I Liability Management.
   6.51.1. Clearing FMSO I Liability. The CLSSA customer's liability must be addressed when
   an item/quantity is moved from the stock level file into the liability or termination file, or
   when removed from the liability or termination files. The following processes apply to
   reparable and consumable items.
   6.51.2. Clearing Liability through Liability File Processing.
       6.51.2.1. FMS non H-coded (non-repair/replace) requisitions that process through
       SAMIS will be used to remove items/quantities from the liability and termination files;
       thereby, clearing the CLSSA customer's liability. There is an exception to this process:
       requisitions with advice codes “6P” (new and unused), “BV,” “6V,” “6W” (sole source),
       and “2C,” “2J,” “22,” “31,” “32,” “33” (do not substitute) are not used to clear liability.
       This is because these codes do not allow the IM to consider all assets when filling the
       requisition. Attachment 8 is a detailed example of liability file processing. (Reference
       paragraph 6.8 for a description of the different types of FMS requisitions.)
       6.51.2.2. SAMIS will use both programmed and non-programmed non H-coded
       requisitions to remove items/quantities from the Liability and Termination Files.
          6.51.2.2.1. The programmed requisitions are entitled to support using on-hand/on-
          order stock. Filling these requisitions removes assets from the supply system.
          Clearing FMSO I liability and removing the assets from the supply system results in
          the supply system being in balance.
          6.51.2.2.2. Non-programmed non H-coded requisitions that are used by SAMIS to
          remove items from the Liability/Termination Files will be uniquely coded with an
          “NU” Fund Code and a Program Code of “2.” This coding automatically causes the
          IM to consider filling the requisition with available on-hand/on-order stocks. If there
          are insufficient stocks to fill the requisition, the IM may change the Fund Code to 4F
          and obtain the item with FMS Direct Cite Funds. This process gives the IM the
          opportunity to review stocks and use them, if available, to fill requisitions that are
          used to clear FMSO I liability. If stocks are not available to fill the requisition, it
          verifies that there are no assets for which the CLSSA customer is liable.
       6.51.2.3. Based on NIIN, any increase in a stock level will remove a corresponding
       item/quantity from the liability file. The increased stock level accounts for the liability
       for the item.
       6.51.2.4. When there is no stock level for any FMS country, the item is moved to the
       termination file.
   6.51.3. Clearing Liability through Termination File Processing.
       6.51.3.1. The termination file is used to track and clear excess FMSO I items and
       quantities when no country has a stock level. In most cases, this is when there has not
       been an FMS recurring demand for the NSN in four years. The termination file is also
       used when an NSN becomes ineligible for the FMSO I. Items that become ineligible for
       the FMSO I due to catalog changes are moved to the termination file, and normal
       termination file processing occurs.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                127


     6.51.3.2. Every six months (January and July), SAMIS will produce “CLSSA
     Termination Absorption Request” forms for those items in the termination file and route
     them to the IM via the 430 SCMS. The IM fills in the blanks with the appropriate
     information and returns the form to the FMS Focal Point who will input the data to
     SAMIS. See Attachment 9 for instruction on processing the request form.
     6.51.3.3. SAMIS will use the data to determine if absorption is possible or not. If
     possible, the item/quantity will be removed from the termination file and customer
     liability cleared. If not possible, a record of the review will be made, and the item/QTY
     reviewed again six months later. SAMIS processing logic for the Absorption Requests is
     as follows:
         6.51.3.3.1. If the asset position is optimum or short, the requested QTY will be
         absorbed. The item/quantity will be removed from the termination file and the
         customer's liability will be cleared.
         6.51.3.3.2. If the asset position is over, SAMIS will subtract the Other Than War
         Reserve materiel (OWRM) and the “non-programmed FMS B/Os from the over QTY
         to determine an “Adjusted Over Quantity” (AOQ).
            6.51.3.3.2.1. If the AOQ is less than or equal to zero (in other words short or
            optimum), the request QTY will be absorbed. The item/QTY will be removed
            from the termination file and the customer's liability will be cleared.
            6.51.3.3.2.2. If the AOQ is greater than zero and less than the request QTY, the
            difference between the request QTY and the AOQ will be absorbed. The
            absorbed QTY will be removed from the termination File and the customer's
            liability will be cleared.
            6.51.3.3.2.3. If the AOQ is greater than or equal to the request quantity, no
            absorption is possible.
     6.51.3.4. An item/quantity may remain in the termination file for two years. If not
     absorbed within the two years, the item/quantity will be placed on a drawdown
     requisition and routed to the IM for resolution. D035A will place the drawdown
     requisition on “9P” exception. Normal drawdown requisition processing applies.
  6.51.4. Clearing Liability Using Drawdown Requisitions.
     6.51.4.1. The primary means of clearing CLSSA customer FMSO I liability is through
     liability and termination file processing. Drawdown Requisitions are used to remove
     items/quantities from the termination file both during and at the end of the two-year
     absorption review period.
         6.51.4.1.1. A customer may remove an item/quantity from the termination file at any
         time using a file maintenance transaction. However, this action is not recommended
         as it circumvents the normal termination processing. It should only be used if the
         country determines that they actually do want the additional asset.
            6.51.4.1.1.1. An XD5-7 transaction will remove a partial quantity from the
            termination file. It is used to decrease the quantity of an item in the termination
            file and will result in a drawdown requisition.

              from the termination file. The XD5-8 transaction also results in a drawdown
              requisition. Drawdown requisitions are only created by SAMIS when items are
              removed from the FMSO I and may not be input directly.

          6.51.4.1.2. At the conclusion of the absorption review period (normally two years),
          SAMIS will remove the items from the termination file and create “skeleton”
          drawdown requisitions. They are called “skeleton” drawdown requisitions because
          they are missing the DCN, supplementary address, and disposition code. The
          AFSAC FMSO I manager will request the missing information from the country. If
          not received in 30 days, the FMSO I manager will follow-up. If no response is
          received by two weeks before the end of the quarter, the FMSO I manager will
          complete the requisition using disposition code “D” and allow it to process.
      6.51.4.2. Drawdown requisitions are identified by a “V” in position 11 of the DCN. The
      IM will see them as D035A “9P” exceptions. Drawdown requisitions process IAW the
      “disposition code” which appears in the management code block on the D035A DoDA
      screen. The disposition codes are:
          6.51.4.2.1. “A” — Request the AF absorbs the item. If IM is unable to absorb the
          item, deliver it in existing condition, either serviceable or unserviceable.
          6.51.4.2.2. “B” — Request the AF absorbs the item. If the IM is unable to absorb the
          item, deliver it in serviceable condition. Restore unserviceables to serviceable
          condition. For disposition code “B,” unserviceable assets must be made serviceable
          before shipment. Note: If the IM has been consistently exchanging serviceable assets
130                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


         for country-returned unserviceable assets (such that all that remain are unserviceable
         assets) and there is no repair source, the AF repair depot shall request disposition
         instructions from the foreign customer. This may involve shipping the unserviceable
         asset back to the country and cancelling the drawdown requisition or retaining the
         unserviceable asset and providing the country a credit to their account.
         6.51.4.2.3. “C” — Request the AF absorbs the item. If the IM is unable to absorb the
         item, deliver it in serviceable condition or dispose of unserviceables.
         6.51.4.2.4. “D” — Request the AF absorbs the item. If the IM is unable to absorb the
         item, dispose of regardless of condition.
      6.51.4.3. New procurement is not authorized for drawdown requisitions.
      6.51.4.4. The following actions are to be taken by the IM based upon the disposition
      code and the absorption criteria.
         6.51.4.4.1. Any quantity that can be absorbed will be canceled with a “CA” action.
         The “CA” notification criteria in Section 6C applies. The AFSAC case manager
         must receive a copy of all cancellation correspondence.
         6.51.4.4.2. Any quantity needing delivery to the FMS customer will be processed for
         shipment. If an unserviceable item is shipped, the IM notifies the DFAS billing office
         that an unserviceable item has been shipped to liquidate a CLSSA FMSO I liability,
         and that the stock-fund Mark-Up Price (MUP) is to be billed. For a non-stock fund
         item, the standard price less the repair price will be billed.
         6.51.4.4.3. If the quantity cannot be absorbed and the customer requested disposal
         action, the following applies:
             6.51.4.4.3.1. Cancel the requisition with a “CA” and provide “CA” notification.
             The “CA” notification will state that disposal action will be taken.
             6.51.4.4.3.2. If the asset was in serviceable condition, notify the DFAS billing
             office to bill the asset at the standard price. If the asset was in unserviceable
             condition, notify DFAS to bill the asset at the stock fund MUP.
             6.51.4.4.3.3. No special disposal action is to be initiated for assets that the IM
             cannot absorb when using disposition codes “C” or “D.”                 Subsequent
             computations will consider the reduced FMS requirement, and these assets will be
             considered for disposal at that time using established procedures.
      6.51.4.5. Drawdown Requisition Absorption Criteria.
         6.51.4.5.1. If the asset position is optimum or short (third short at the termination),
         the drawdown requisition quantity is to be absorbed.
         6.51.4.5.2. If the asset position is over, subtract the unfunded OWRM and the non-
         programmed non H-coded FMS back orders, that will be filled from on-hand/on-order
         stocks, from the over quantity to determine an AOQ.
             6.51.4.5.2.1. If the AOQ is less than or equal to zero (in other words short or
             optimum) the drawdown requisition quantity is to be absorbed. The IM will
             cancel (CA) the requisition.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  131


              6.51.4.5.2.2. If the AOQ is greater than zero and less than the drawdown
              requisition quantity, the difference between the drawdown quantity and the AOQ
              is to be absorbed. The IM will process a “CA” cancellation for the absorbed
              quantity.
              6.51.4.5.2.3. If the AOQ is greater than or equal to the drawdown requisition
              quantity, absorption is not possible.
          6.51.4.5.3. See Attachment 9 for information on processing “FMS Non-
          programmed Non H-Coded Back Orders,” Insurance/Numeric Stockage Objective
          (NSO) items, and items without a D200A computation.
      6.51.4.6. All decisions regarding drawdown requisition processing must be documented
      on the requirement computation sheet used to make decisions.
6.52. FMSO I Financial Management.
   6.52.1. Customer Financial Liability. The CLSSA customer is financially liable for all items
   on their FMSO I stock level case. This includes repair and procurement stock levels, and
   items in the liability and termination files. The FMSO I update:
      6.52.1.1. On a quarterly basis:
          6.52.1.1.1. SAMIS updates the FMSO I stock levels and adjusts the liability and
          termination files. The stock levels are automatically computed by SAMIS. Once
          computed, they cannot be manually adjusted in order to avoid a financial deficit
          position.
          6.52.1.1.2. A quarterly financial report showing the revised FMSO I stock level,
          termination and liability file values is provided to each customer (CLSSA Quarterly
          Financial Report — GBL) through either Supply Tracking Reparable
          Return(STARR)/PC, REPORT.WEB, or both.
          6.52.1.1.3. A line item listing report that shows stock levels and termination and
          liability file items and quantities is available upon request from the AFSAC case
          manager (CLSSA Stock Level Item List — GCB) and the product is available the
          next day on REPORT.WEB under the requester’s Management Distribution
          Designator (MDD).
      6.52.1.2. On an as-required basis, the FMSO I will be financially updated. If the FMSO
      I goes into deficit position, the FMSO I case manager and the AFSAC CLSSA PMO will
      analyze and make a determination if the CLSSA customer will be notified that the total of
      the FMSO I requirements exceed the FMSO I case value and will be told that a LOA
      modification will be processed in one year to increase the case value. The purpose of the
      one-year period is to allow the customer time to: budget for the additional funds; initiate
      immediate termination of selected AF items and quantities; or change requisition demand
      patterns or initiate all three actions. The customer may request an amendment to increase
      the FMSO I value as long as the new total is greater than the total item value when the
      amendment is offered. If the determination is that this is an insignificant breach (minor
      dollar value) or that this excess can be resolved in the future, no amendment or
      modification will be processed, but the situation will be monitored for the next several
      update cycles.
 132                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   6.52.2. Close management attention by the CLSSA customer will minimize the need for
   additional FMSO I case funds. If the customer sees that the FMSO I requirements may
   exceed the FMSO I case value, they will adjust their demand pattern to lower the
   requirements value, or budget funds to cover the increased case value.
   6.52.3. The AFSAC FMSO I case manager is responsible for the financial update of the
   FMSO I case.
6.53. FMSO II Requisition Case.
   6.53.1. Introduction.
       6.53.1.1. The FMSO II case is a B/O case that is used by the customer to requisition
       spares. (See paragraph 6.8 for a description of the different types of FMS requisitions.)
       6.53.1.2. Only spares and repair parts (ERRCs “N,” “P,” and “T”) may be requisitioned
       on the FMSO II case.
       6.53.1.3. Both FMSO I and non-FMSO I items may be requisitioned on the FMSO II
       case. Refer to paragraph 6.45.2.2.1 for CLSSA ineligible FMSO I and FMSO II items:
   6.53.2. Requisition Submission. The customer may submit FMSO II requisitions directly to
   SAMIS by the DAMES/Defense Data Network (DDN), ILCS, STARR/PC, DSCA Security
   Cooperation Information Portal (SCIP), AFSAC On-Line, or by mail or message to the
   AFSAC CM. Country submitted FMSO II requisitions:
       6.53.2.1. Must have a priority which is assigned by the customer based on the F/AD and
       the UND. Typically, the UND for re-stocking is “C.” It is important to submit
       requisitions for stock replenishment in a timely manner to minimize the need for priority
       requisitioning.
       6.53.2.2. Must have a “V” Type of Assistance Code (rp 35). For more information on
       type of assistance (TA) codes, refer to DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.19 and DSCA
       5105.38-M, Chapter 5.
       6.53.2.3. Must be submitted IAW MILSTRIP and UMMIPS (see Section 6C).
       6.53.2.4. Must have a demand code in rp 44 as prescribed in DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix
       2.08. All CLSSA requisitions are re-coded as recurring demands by SAMIS upon receipt
       to comply with DSCA CLSSA policy.
   6.53.3. SAMIS Requisition Processing. Upon receipt of the customer's FMSO II case
   requisitions, SAMIS performs the following actions:
       6.53.3.1. The requisition format is checked for accuracy.
       6.53.3.2. FMSO II case dollars are committed for the standard price, or repair price for
       H-coded requisitions.
       6.53.3.3. Recurring requisitions for ineligible FMSO I are recoded as nonrecurring
       (demand code “N” in rp 44).
       6.53.3.4. The requisitions are assigned a programmed or non-programmed code. This
       code is referred to as the Cooperative Logistics Program Support Code (CLPSC). In the
       A31/A41 passing/referral order to the SOS, and in the AE- BU/BW status the customer
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                              133


       country, a “1” indicates programmed, a “2” indicates non-programmed. In D035
       products, the program code is called the management code. The below table explains the
       codes used in SAMIS products to indicate the programmed or non-programmed status of
       requisitions:

Table 6.11. Programmed/Non-Programmed Codes
Code    Programmed/Non-Programmed Explanation
1       Programmed                External Code. The requisition is eligible for
                                  support from depot stocks.
2       Non-programmed            External Code. The requisition is only eligible for
                                  support from excess assets or from new
                                  procurement.
3       Programmed                Consumable Item Requisition
4       Programmed                Repair/Replace Requisition
5       Non-programmed            Ineligible for CLSSA
6       Programmed                Non-Repair/Replace Investment Item Requisition
7       Non-programmed            Requisition was nonrecurring
8       Non-programmed            Investment items only. No Worldwide FMSO I
                                  stock level.
9       Non-programmed            Investment items only. Requisition QTY exceeded
                                  Worldwide EPQ
          6.53.3.4.1. For DLA expense (ERRCs “N” and “P”) items, SAMIS codes all
          requisitions for eligible FMSO I items as programmed.
          6.53.3.4.2. For AF-managed items, SAMIS assigns the programmed, non-
          programmed code as follows:
              6.53.3.4.2.1. If the requisition has a recurring demand code (“R” in rp 44),
              SAMIS will code the requisition programmed within available worldwide EPQ.
              If the requisition quantity is less than or equal to the EPQ, it is coded
              programmed. If it is greater than the EPQ, it is coded non-programmed. A
              consistent and steady demand pattern by the country will increase the number of
              requisitions coded programmed. SAMIS will not split a requisition and code part
              programmed and part non-programmed.
              6.53.3.4.2.2. If a customer participates in CLSSA for just selected investment
              NSNs, SAMIS will code recurring requisitions for the selected NSNs as
              programmed within the available EPQ. Recurring requisitions for non-selected
              NSNs are recoded as nonrecurring, and therefore, non-programmed.
              6.53.3.4.2.3. All repair/replace (H-coded) requisitions processed on FMSO II
              cases will be: coded as recurring demands, coded programmed within the
              available worldwide EPQ, and used to compute FMSO I repair stock levels. H-
              coded requisitions processed on maintenance “M” cases are considered
              nonrecurring, non-programmed, and are not used to compute FMSO I repair stock
              levels.
              6.53.3.4.2.4. All requisitions that process on other than a FMSO II case are
134                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


             considered nonrecurring and non-programmed.
             6.53.3.4.2.5. SAMIS maintains the FMSO I SLQs using the I&S master.
             Requisitions for I&S family members will be coded programmed or non-
             programmed based on the worldwide EPQ for the master NSN.
      6.53.3.5. The requisitions are then passed to the SOS.
      6.53.3.6. Recurring FMSO II case requisitions are recorded in a SAMIS demand history
      file for the purpose of determining the AMD, the SLQ, and the FMSO I case value. (The
      demand history file is shown in the “CLSSA Stock Level Item Query” Report.)
  6.53.4. D035/IM Requisition Processing:
      6.53.4.1. Items are shipped from stock, or are placed on order for the country. The
      decision to ship from stock depends on the number of assets available, the control level
      and support level, the priority of the requisition, and whether or not the requisition is
      programmed.
      6.53.4.2. Programmed requisitions with:
         6.53.4.2.1. Priorities 1-3 and programmed NMCS requisitions are eligible to be filled
         from stock down to the zero stock level.
         6.53.4.2.2. Priorities 4-8 are eligible to be supported from stock down to the critical
         support level.
         6.53.4.2.3. Priorities 9-15 are eligible to be supported from stock down to the support
         level.
         6.53.4.2.4. Back orders are to be released for shipment based on UMMIPS as assets
         are received.
         6.53.4.2.5. Non-programmed requisitions will be filled from depot stocks if assets
         are in long supply (above the control level). The IM’s only obligation for a non-
         programmed requisition is to place it on contract lead time away; this includes non-
         programmed NCMS requisitions.
         6.53.4.2.6. Support for programmed requisitions using stocks under IM control (on-
         hand, due-in-from procurement, Due-In From Maintenance[DIFM]) is preferred. If
         this is not possible, new procurement by the IM, or support via the PROS contractor
         is an option. Programmed requisitions and repair/replace (H-coded) requisitions may
         not be sent to PROS unless coordinated with the SOS. See PROS section of this
         manual for details.
      6.53.4.3. Non-programmed Requisitions: All non-programmed requisitions will be
      automatically processed by D035A until the asset position reaches the control level.
      When the asset position is below the control level, non-programmed requisitions will be
      back ordered by D035A and output to the IM for review.
         6.53.4.3.1. Usually, shipments from stock below the control level will be made only
         when support for programmed requirements (USG and CLSSA) will not be affected.
         Shipment of non-programmed requisitions from stock from below the control level is
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                               135


        accepted by DoD as a valid means of support, if such issues do not affect support of
        US forces and FMS programmed requisitions, and only at the discretion of the IMM.
        6.53.4.3.2. The decision to fill non-programmed requisitions from stock must be
        made with care. To emphasize this, approval from the first level supervisor must be
        obtained before filling non-programmed FMS requisitions using assets below the
        control level.
     6.53.4.4. If the IM determines that an FMS non-programmed non H-coded requisition
     cannot be supported from available stock, action must be taken to make sure support is
     available within procurement lead time. Three options are available:
        6.53.4.4.1. The item may be placed on contract for direct delivery which requires that
        direct cite (4F) funds will be used.
        6.53.4.4.2. The item may be placed on back order if enough assets are on order, or
        due-in from repair to meet the requirement. If not, new procurement with “4F” funds
        should be used. Back ordered requisitions will be given a Non-Programmed Suspense
        Date (NPSD). If stock becomes available before the expiration of the NPSD, and the
        asset position goes above the control level, release-for-shipment will be made. If not
        filled by the expiration of the NPSD, the requisition will be treated as programmed
        and filled based on priority.
        6.53.4.4.3. The requisition may be routed to PROS.        See PROS section of this
        manual for details.
     6.53.4.5. D035A automatically assigns a 180-day NPSD to non-programmed
     repair/replace (H-coded) requisition back orders.
     6.53.4.6. FMS Non-programmed, Non H-coded Requisitions with “NU” fund codes.
        6.53.4.6.1. Normally non-programmed, non H-coded requisitions will have a “4F”
        fund-code and processing is as described above.
        6.53.4.6.2. Non-programmed, non H-coded requisitions may also have an “NU” fund
        code. An “NU” fund code in a non-programmed, non H-coded requisition indicates
        that SAMIS used the requisition to clear customer CLSSA liability for the requisition
        quantity. The “NU” means that at one time there was a CLSSA stock level for this
        quantity, and assets may have been bought by the IM to support the requirement. As
        a result, the IM should examine their asset-to-requirements position and consider
        supporting the requisition with on-hand/on-order stock, or from repair. If on-
        hand/on-order stocks and due-in-from-repair are insufficient to meet projected future
        needs, the IM may change the fund code to “4F” and place the requirement on
        contract, or route it to PROS.
     6.53.4.7. FMS requisition fund codes.
        6.53.4.7.1. SAMIS assigns a fund code to all FMS requisitions to indicate the type of
        funds that are to be used.
            6.53.4.7.1.1. Fund code “NU” indicates that AFMC funds are to be used in
            support of the requisition with later reimbursement from country funds. “NU”
            indicates reimbursable funding.
136                                                AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


         6.53.4.7.1.2. Fund code “4F” indicates that country funds are to be directly cited
         in support of the requirement. AFMC funds are not used. “4F” indicates direct
         cite funding.
      6.53.4.7.2. SAMIS assigns the fund code to requisitions using the following logic:
         6.53.4.7.2.1. Requisitions that meet the CLSSA FMSO I criteria are coded
         programmed, and an “NU” fund code is assigned.
         6.53.4.7.2.2. All repair/replace, H-coded requisitions, whether programmed or
         non-programmed, are assigned an “NU” fund code.
         6.53.4.7.2.3. Non-programmed requisitions (other than H-coded) may be
         assigned either an “NU” or a “4F” fund code.
             6.53.4.7.2.3.1. Fund code “NU” will be assigned if the NSN/quantity was
             used to clear CLSSA FMSO I liability.
             6.53.4.7.2.3.2. Fund code “4F” will be assigned if the NSN/quantity was not
             used to clear CLSSA FMSO I liability.
      6.53.4.7.3. As a rule, once assigned, requisition fund codes should not be changed.
      However, there are times when it is prudent to change the fund code to improve the
      quality of support.
         6.53.4.7.3.1. Non-programmed Non H-coded Requisitions with “NU” Fund
         Code: Blanket authority is given to the IM to change the fund code for non-
         programmed non H-coded requisitions from “NU” to “4F.” The purpose of
         coding non-programmed non H-coded requisitions with an “NU” fund code is to
         advise the IM to consider using available stocks or repair when filling the
         requisition. This is done because the NSN/quantity was once a CLSSA stock
         level, and stocks may have been procured by the IM to support it. This gives the
         IM the opportunity to use on-hand/on-order stocks or repair action to clear out
         these assets. If stocks aren’t available, the IM is authorized to change the fund
         code to “4F” and procure the items or to route the requisition to PROS.
         6.53.4.7.3.2. Programmed (Non H-coded) Requisitions: For programmed (non
         H-coded) requisitions with an “NU” fund code, the AFSAC case managers and
         the 430 SCMS may authorize a fund code change if it will improve support. Each
         situation will have to be evaluated on its own merits. A fund code change should
         be considered an action of last resort. The fund code on an H-coded requisition
         shall never be changed.
      6.53.4.7.4. Programmed support is a special commitment by AFMC to support that
      requirement. Changing a programmed non H-coded requisition from “NU” to “4F” is
      not allowed. A programmed requisition indicates support is to be provided from on-
      hand or on-order depot stocks. This applies to items that CLSSA customers have
      identified to be included in the requirements computation forecast and for which they
      have paid an equity deposit to ensure stock is available in one of those categories.
      Even if new procurement is the only action for filling the requisition, procurement
      will be accomplished with AF funds which are then reimbursed at the standard price.
      Changing the fund code to “4F” implies that stock was not procured as paid for and
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   137


           defined. In that case, use of the country’s equity deposit funding was not used for the
           purpose intended and is tantamount to misuse of FMS funds resulting in violation of
           the AECA.
   6.53.5. Amended shipping instructions as described in AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1 (when
   published) may be used to support FMS back orders.
   6.53.6. Approved suitable substitutes will be provided through the I&S program except for
   H-coded requisitions. Repair/replace must always replace the returned unserviceable with
   the same level of asset. If the replacement is an older I&S item, the country will be placed in
   a position of losing money on the exchange. If the replacement is an older I&S item, the AF
   will (in most cases) lose money on upgrading the returned item to the newer configuration or
   will lose money by needing to dispose of the older item. By law, the AF can neither make
   nor lose money in supporting a FMS.
   6.53.7. Programmed requisitions are subject to Maximum Release Quantity (MRQ) edits.
   6.53.8. FMSO II costs include:
       6.53.8.1. The cost of the materiel shipped.
       6.53.8.2. A 3.8 percent administrative charge. This fee funds DoD costs involved in
       negotiating, implementing, and managing the case.
       6.53.8.3. For non-stock fund shipments, the PCH&T charge (3.5 percent) and inland
       CONUS transportation charge (3.75 percent) are applied when applicable.
   6.53.9. Depot shipments of stock-fund items and shipment of items from stock-fund
   contracts are considered stock-fund sales. Stock-fund sales help the AFSC meet its sales
   goals and their unit cost targets. FMS requisitions placed on direct cite (4F) procurement or
   routed to PROS are not stock-fund sales.
6.54. The Quality of Storage, Maintenance, and Modifications. The quality of items
furnished by the DoD to the CLSSA customer will be the same in all respects to that furnished to
AF. Items identified by the FMS customer on the FMSO I, will be stored, maintained or
modified, as the case may be, in the same way as identical items for the AF. The FMS customer
is charged for modification kits/materiel IAW FMS procedures for depot stock that is upgraded.
6.55. CLSSA Funding.
   6.55.1. FMSO I:
       6.55.1.1. The FMSO I case is divided into two parts: Part A, the on-hand portion; and
       Part B, the on-order dependable undertaking which provides the OA necessary to award
       the contracts needed to support the CLSSA customer through the administrative and
       procurement lead times.
           6.55.1.1.1. Cash paid on acceptance of the FMSO I is equal to 5/17ths of the total
           case value and is known as the equity deposit. As the case increases, the 5/17ths
           investment increases. This is a refundable charge. Note: Countries entering the
           CLSSA program after December 2005 will be charged an equity deposit of 30 percent
           (instead of 5/17ths).
 138                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


          6.55.1.1.2. A non-refundable administrative surcharge of five percent will be charged
          on the 5/17 portion of the FMSO I case, and on any amendments/modifications which
          increase the value of the case. No administrative surcharge will be charged on the
          12/17 portion of the FMSO I case. The administrative charge is not refunded when
          the case value is decreased; but if the case is then subsequently increased, it is
          collected again on the increased value.
       6.55.1.2. The payment for the on-order portion isn't usually collected. However, the
       FMS customer is financially liable for all FMSO I materiel when the stock level case is
       terminated or reduced if the materiel isn't needed by the AF or another FMS customer.
       6.55.1.3. Increases or decreases in the FMSO I stock level requirements may need
       additional funds from, or a refund to a CLSSA customer. The dollar value increase or
       decrease will be shown on an LOA amendment or modification prepared by the AFSAC
       case manager.
   6.55.2. FMSO II:
       6.55.2.1. The FMSO II LOA will include the estimated total materiel cost and the
       following additional charges:
          6.55.2.1.1. An appropriate transportation charge for non- stock fund shipments.
          6.55.2.1.2. A prescribed administrative charge. Currently this is 3.8 percent.
       6.55.2.2. The customer will make an initial deposit with the DFAS in cash for the
       amount stated on the face of the FMSO II LOA. Quarterly payments will be made to
       DFAS by the FMS customer IAW the LOA payment schedule.
6.56. CLSSA Termination.
   6.56.1. Termination is the cancellation of the CLSSA program in its entirety or the
   elimination of one or more weapons or other major systems from the CLSSA program.
   6.56.2. The AFSAC On-Line CLSSA Reporting program will be used to terminate Parts or
   all of the customer’s CLSSA program.
   6.56.3. Refer to DoDI 2000.20, Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangements, for
   ramifications of the termination process.
   6.56.4. When the termination file process is complete, the case manager will prepare an
   LOA modification or amendment to reduce the FMSO I case by an appropriate amount.
   When the case is reduced, the corresponding 5/17th investment can then be returned to the
   country. The case manager will send an E-mail to AFLCMC/WFCI, who will in turn notify
   HQ AFMC/FMRS, who will request refund authority from SAF/FMBMR. Upon approval,
   AFLCMC/WFCI will coordinate the transfer of funds by DFAS-JACK/CO and DFAS-
   JAX/IN.
   6.56.5. SAMIS CLSSA Report Products:
       6.56.5.1. SAMIS produces CLSSA and repair/replace report products for use by the
       customer to manage their CLSSA and repair/replace programs. Some of these reports are
       “push” reports automatically generated by SAMIS and provided in various media to the
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                139


       customer. Other SAMIC reports are “pull” reports that the customer can order which will
       also be sent to various media.
       6.56.5.2. In order for these report products to be available for the customer, there are
       several conditions that must exist. The customer must have:
          6.56.5.2.1. A SAMIS account (to get an MDD) so that the “pull” products can be
          ordered.
          6.56.5.2.2. A REPORT.WEB account in order to view/print/save the report products.
          6.56.5.2.3. Most importantly, their media and copy requirements recorded in SAMIS.

Section 6H—- REQUIRED AVAILABILITY DATE (RAD) MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

6.57. Overview. The AF RAD management program is implemented by the procedures in this
section. The RAD is used to help the AF meet its delivery commitments found in the accepted
and funded LOA.
6.58. Application of RADs.
   6.58.1. The RAD is in rp 63-64 of the DD Form 1348 or 1348M requisition. It is preceded
   by an alpha code “A” in rp 62.
   6.58.2. Numeric codes in number of months do not necessarily mean the corresponding
   calendar month. For example, if the date on a requisition is June, and the RAD assigned is
   10 months, the 10 is not the calendar month of October. It is April of the following year.
   6.58.3. Changes to a RAD are usually directed by the PM (for activation case) and
   country/case manager (D/O case) if the activation date or need date changes. The RAD is
   not necessarily the same as the ESD. Changes in the ESD will not result in a RAD change.
6.59. Purpose of a RAD.
   6.59.1. RADs show delivery commitments for major weapons systems, end items,
   concurrent spares/repair parts, and equipment type items bought under FMS cases and/or GA
   program lines.
   6.59.2. RADs show when extra action is needed to improve ESDs.
   6.59.3. RADs will not be used to delay or suspense shipment of items in long supply.
6.60. Scope. This section dictates who sets up RADs for requisitions supporting initial
activation, D/O cases, and GA program lines.
6.61. Administrative. All correspondence on RAD adjustments will be maintained as part of
the total case or RCN file and retired with the complete file.
6.62. Categories Excluded from RAD Assignment.
   6.62.1. FMS. RAD control procedures do not apply to B/O cases, open end, or CLSSA
   requisitions submitted by the FMS customer.
   6.62.2. MAP. RAD control procedures do not apply to requisitions sent by the FMS
   customer for follow on spares and other program lines specifically excluded from RAD
   control.

6.63. Conditions Impacting RAD Assignments.
   6.63.1. The following conditions impact RAD assignments and are used by all individuals
   authorized to set up and/or assign RADs.
       6.63.1.1. Weapon system activation date.
       6.63.1.2. Item is needed before the activation date for training, facilities, delivery
       support, etc.
       6.63.1.3. Item is available from in-country stocks.
       6.63.1.4. Customer has asked for a specific delivery date.
6.64. RAD Assignment Responsibilities.
   6.64.1. Initial Activation Cases.
       6.64.1.1. The PM is responsible for assigning RADs to all initial activation case
       requisitions with case designators ''D,'' “Q,” “S,” “W,” or “Y.”
       6.64.1.2. The PM-assigned RAD will be 15 days before the in-country activation date of
       the aircraft, weapons system, major end item, etc., as shown in the LOA. Exceptions are,
       such as when the FMS customer asks for a specific date and the requested date is in the
       approved LOA or approved by the SAF country director. When this occurs, the requested
       date is put on the requisition as the RAD. Another exception would be when a partial
       delivery for spares is provided and the remaining items will be supplied by the next need
       date, the new RAD will be entered.
   6.64.2. Follow-on Support Cases.
       6.64.2.1. AFSAC case managers are responsible for assigning RADs to requisitions for
       “A,” “C,” “Q,” and “V” cases. These RADs are based on CWTs shown in the LOA data
       (provided by the AFLCMC case/line manager) unless the FMS customer asks for a
       specific RAD and it is in the LOA with the agreement of the IMS.
       6.64.2.2. Military Assistance.
          6.64.2.2.1. The case managers will assign RADs to all requisitions for end items,
          initial SE, concurrent spares, and spare parts applicable to major end items and
          weapon systems.
          6.64.2.2.2. These RADs can be set up for 15 days before the in-country activation
          date of the weapon system or major end item, or as a country specified RAD when
          they are in the LOA.
6.65. RAD Review Responsibilities.
   6.65.1. The IMS will review the D035A computer systems generated management products
   to check on the RADs assigned.
   6.65.2. The PM will review SAMIS product PCN: U-W001.-HBB, “Open Requisitions:
   Status Code Interrogation,” U-W001.-HBC, “Comprehensive Requisition/Custom
   Commitment Data” (Reports Control System [RCS]: MTCIA(AR)8407), or U-W00l.-HCC
   (product 20), “ESD Exceeds RAD Notice,” to check the status of requisitioned items.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                         141


   6.65.3. The case managers will review the SAMIS product PCN: U-W001.-HBB, to check
   the overall status of items supporting their cases. This product can serve as a basis for
   starting follow-up actions with the IMS/PM when it seems a problem has or could develop.
6.66. Management Actions to Meet an Assigned RAD.
   6.66.1. IMSs are expected to take extra actions to fill requisitions before RAD expiration.
   These include:
       6.66.1.1. Accelerating manufacture and/or repair when acceleration charges are
       approved.
       6.66.1.2. Amending shipping instructions.
       6.66.1.3. Shipping partial quantities from stock.
       6.66.1.4. Buying the item on a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).
       6.66.1.5. Telling an PM to buy the item on a provisioned item order.
   6.66.2. PMs must monitor assigned weapon system activation programs to make sure IMSs
   take action to ship at least a partial quantity of all requisitioned initial spares, repair parts, and
   SE before the RAD.
6.67. RAD Management Responsibilities.
   6.67.1. The IMS will:
       6.67.1.1. Prepare “ZFY” file maintenance transactions and process them to D035 when a
       RAD is adjusted by the PM or case manager.
       6.67.1.2. Review computer generated management products to check on RADs
       assigned/adjusted.
   6.67.2. The PM will:
       6.67.2.1. Direct a RAD change if initial activation date is changed.
       6.67.2.2. Check computer generated management products to review RADs assigned to
       requisitions supporting weapon systems activation.
       6.67.2.3. Answer requests for help or guidance from the IMS, case manager, or the FMS
       customer.
   6.67.3. AFSAC case managers will:
       6.67.3.1. Check computer generated management products for RADs assigned to FMS
       cases or GA program lines they manage.
       6.67.3.2. Make follow up actions to the IMS/PM to make sure every effort is made to
       meet the RAD.
6.68. RAD Adjustments—Why. RADs are adjusted if:
   6.68.1. The FMS customer asks for an adjustment in the delivery schedule on a D/O case
   (SAF approved).
   6.68.2. A partial delivery is made to provide short term support, and the balance is not
   needed in country until a later date to maintain full term support.
 142                                                   AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   6.68.3. The delivery schedule for initial support on an activation program is changed. Note:
   RADs will not be changed just because of a slippage in the estimated shipping date.
6.69. RAD Adjustment—Who.
   6.69.1. The PM or case manager will direct the IMS in maintaining/adjusting RADs. The
   IMS will prepare file maintenance transactions to adjust RADs with direction from the PM or
   case manager.
   6.69.2. If there is no IMS, the PM/case manager sends an E-mail with NSN, and
   nomenclature to the 430 SCMS to request assistance.
6.70. RAD Adjustment—How.
   6.70.1. For items managed by D035. Upon direction of the PM or case manager, the IMS
   will prepare and send to D035, a “ZFY” file maintenance transaction (AFMCMAN 23-5,
   Volume 1 when published).
   6.70.2. For Items Not Managed by D035 (Such As Services). RADs are not assigned to
   these items. Custom commitment controls are usually used.
6.71. Items Controlled by MILSTRIP.
   6.71.1. Customer Notification. When the IMS inputs a “ZFY” transaction to D035, a “B3”
   MILSTRIP status is produced. It is the official FMS customer notification of an RAD
   update. Further action is not necessary unless the FMS customer can justify asking for a
   written notification. The customer must depend on our mechanized status reporting. Written
   notification will be given by the PM or the case manager.
   6.71.2. Case Manager Notification. After updating the D035 data base, notice of the RAD
   update is passed through different data systems to SAMIS. Case managers will send these
   products to the PM when the products are not available through local terminals. SAMIS
   produces the following RAD status products (refer to the SAMIS online users guide for more
   information):
       6.71.2.1. RAD Change Notice (PCN: U-W001.-HCB).
       6.71.2.2. ESD Exceed RAD Notice (PCN: U-W001.HCC).
       6.71.2.3. RAD Has Passed (PCN: U-W001.-HCD).
   6.71.3. IMS Notification. A D035 system management product is sent monthly to the IMS.
   This product is AD032.1L2-MB-GBZ, Grant Aid/FMS Back Order Listing (Manager
   Designator Sequence). It is used for management research and corrective action to solve
   delinquent delivery schedules for materiel.
6.72. Items Not Controlled by MILSTRIP.
   6.72.1. The IMS must take action when an ESD slips more than 90 days. The IMS must
   notify the case manager of the slippage in writing. This notification will explain why the
   slippage occurred and provide a new ESD. Sufficient documentation to support this slippage
   will be included in the notification. Any corrective actions that are being taken, or being
   considered, will also be included.
   6.72.2. The Case Manager will:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   143


       6.72.2.1. After receiving written notice of the slippage, notify the agency/activity that
       processed the LOA. The agency/activity will prepare “notification of modification of
       offer and acceptance.” The notification of modification of offer and acceptance is sent to
       the FMS customer. Since these slippages are not MILSTRIP controlled, this form is
       official notification to the customer of an ESD slipping more than 90 days.
       6.72.2.2. Maintain all correspondence in the case file until the case is completed. After
       the case is completed, all correspondence is retired as part of the whole case file.
6.73. IMS Computer Support System (D035A).
   6.73.1. To help the IMSs meet their RAD assignment responsibilities, D035A is
   programmed to routinely provide a specialized RAD management product.
   6.73.2. PCN A-D035.4L2-MB-GBZ is the D035 system monthly product that gives the
   status of all ESDs that exceed the RAD or will exceed the RAD in the next 45 days. This
   product prints in manager designator sequence, as of the 10th of each month.
   6.73.3. Copies of PCN A-D035.-1L2-MB-GBZ are sent to the IMS through the division
   control point. This product is reviewed to identify items needing extra management actions
   to meet the RAD (paragraph 6.66). The listing is annotated to show actions to be taken.
   The original product is kept by the IMS. Copy number one is given to the immediate
   supervisor.
6.74. PM and Case Managers' Support System (SAMIS). To help the PM and the case
managers to meet their RAD management responsibilities, SAMIS will provide specialized RAD
management reports. These reports are available to the PM and materiel managers through local
SAMIS terminals. When the PM or case manager directs a RAD change, the “ZFY” file
maintenance data transaction is input to the D035 system by the IMS.

Section 6I—TRANSPORTATION

6.75. Ferrying of Aircraft. When ferrying of aircraft is involved, it is the responsibility of the
FMS customer to negotiate with AFSAC on a case-by-case basis for flight delivery of aircraft
bought under the FMS program. All costs involved are paid by the recipient customer as
documented on the applicable LOA. SA materiel will be transported according to the policy and
procedures in DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Cargo Movement.
6.76. Packaging and Marking. FMS materiel will be packaged IAW the latest revision of
Military Standard (MIL-STD) 2073-1E, Department of Defnese: Standard Practice for Military
Packaging, and AFMCI 24-201, AFMC Packaging and Materials Handling Policies and
Procedures. Military preservation and Level B packing per MIL-STD-2073-1E is required for
OSs air shipments. Military preservation and Level A packing per MIL-STD-2073-1E is
required for OS surface shipment. All FMS shipments shall be marked IAW the latest revision
of MIL-STD-129P, Department of Defense Standard Practice: Military Marking for Shipment
and Storage.
   6.76.1. Required markings will also include the following items.
       6.76.1.1. FMS case identifier.
       6.76.1.2. Transportation Control Number (TCN).
 144                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       6.76.1.3. Transportation priority.
       6.76.1.4. Project Code, if applicable.
       6.76.1.5. “Ship-From” address.
       6.76.1.6. “Ship-To” address.
       6.76.1.7. Ultimate consignee/”Mark-For” address (Military Assistance Program Address
       Code [MAPAC] and clear text address if applicable).
   6.76.2. Consolidation policy is governed by DLM 4000.25-1, Chapter 6, paragraph 6.17.
   Consolidations of FMS materiel may be made when the following criteria are met:
       6.76.2.1. Same US sponsoring service.
       6.76.2.2. Same FMS case designator.
       6.76.2.3. Same “Mark For” location.
       6.76.2.4. Same “Ship To” FF location.
       6.76.2.5. The same priority designator — materiel with priority designators 01-08 may
       be consolidated, but will not be mixed with materiel of lower priorities.
   6.76.3. Consolidation is not done when the physical configuration of an item is incompatible
   with other items shipped to the same destination. Items designated as explosives are not
   consolidated with other items destined to the same consignee. HAZMAT may be
   consolidated unless prohibited by the loading and storage instructions of Title 49, Code of
   Federal Regulations, Transportation.
   6.76.4. When FMS materiel is shipped to a FF (other than “XX”, rp 46-46) and a specific
   code (other than a numeric zero) is in rp 33, clear text in-country destination addresses are
   marked on shipping containers. “Ship-to” and “mark-for” codes and related clear text
   address information is contained in DLM 4000.25-1, Volume 6, Chapter 3.
6.77. Preparation and Distribution of DD Form 1348-1A.
   6.77.1. One set of the release/receipt documents, DD Forms 1348-1A, is prepared and
   distributed IAW DLM 4000.25-1, Chapter 5. The DD Form 1348-1A consists of a three
   copy set. Copy number 1 will be retained by the shipper; copy number 2 will be secured to
   the outside of the shipping container in a waterproof envelope; and copy number 3 will be
   placed inside the shipping container. If items are consolidated for shipment, a copy of the
   DD Form 1348-1A for each item will be placed inside the waterproof envelope and affixed to
   the outside of the shipping container. Copies of the DD Form 1348 are available on the
   DSCA SCIP in the Enhanced Freight Tracking System (EFTS).
   6.77.2. The preceding distribution procedures are applicable to the DD Form 1149.

Section 6J—PROCESSING FMS SUPPLY DISCREPANCY REPORTS (SDR)

6.78. Purpose. This section establishes guidance, responsibilities and procedures for submitting
and processing AF SDRs for FMS shipments. The term “Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR)”
identifies all forms and formats of discrepancy reports that have evolved from SF 364. The FMS
customer submits SDRs via the AFSAC Online SDR Submission Wizard tool (automated SF 364
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   145


equivalent to get possible financial adjustment, disposition instructions for discrepant materiel,
or for information only. As a general rule, the SDR is not submitted for replacement of materiel;
the replacement/repair option remains available to the DoD ICP/Integrated Materiel Manager
(IMM) or contractor when this is the most reasonable solution.
6.79. Scope. This section applies to AF agencies that provide SA materiel from stock and
procurement to FMS customers through an LOA. Types of discrepancies reported include those
identified in DLM 4000.25, Volume 2, Chapter 17, paragraph C17.1.7. and AFJMAN 23-215 .
The following types of discrepancies are excluded from the responsibilities and procedures
identified in this section:
   6.79.1. Deficiencies, such as those identified in TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 5, which are
   reported only for analysis, repair, replacement, or information, but have no possibility of
   obtaining financial reimbursement. If financial reimbursement/restitution is desired, SA
   customers must report product quality deficiencies on an SDR.
   6.79.2. Discrepancies identified in DLM 4000.25, Volume 2, Chapter 17, paragraph
   C17.1.6.and AFJMAN 23-215, paragraph 3b.
6.80. General.
   6.80.1. AFSAC is the designated AF FMS SDR ILCO found in DLM 4000.25, Volume 2,
   Chapter 17; AFMAN 16-101, paragraph 5.10; and AFJMAN 23-215. AFSAC and the term
   ILCO are used interchangeably in this section.
   6.80.2. All correspondence to and from FMS customers for SDR processing will be directed
   to and from the ILCO.
   6.80.3. Credits or debits, as a result of processing SDRs are applied to the proper FMS case
   or to the FMS customer's trust fund, if the case is closed.
6.81. Roles and Responsibilities.
   6.81.1. AFLCMC/WFN (with the appropriate HQ AFMC coordination) will designate the
   SDR control office at AFMC centers that receive SDRs from the ILCO.
   6.81.2. The ILCO will:
       6.81.2.1. Act as the AF FMS SDR processing office ensuring compliance with AFMAN
       16-101, paragraph 5.10.
       6.81.2.2. Receive all AF SDRs from the FMS customers.
       6.81.2.3. Provide electronic acknowledgements of receipt and access to SDR Monthly
       Status Reports via AFSAC Online to FMS customers.
       6.81.2.4. Input reply into DoD WebSDR to reject SDRs to FMS customers that do not
       meet submission requirements. Rejection will include an explanation for the SDR denial.
       6.81.2.5. Process SDRs according to DLM 4000.25, Volume 2, Chapter 17; AFJMAN
       23-215; and this section.
       6.81.2.6. Control/track and adjudicate the customers' claims by approving or
       disapproving SDR decisions given by the commands or agencies. HQ AFMC centers,
       other AF MAJCOMs, and their subordinate organizations make decisions on SDRs based
 146                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       on information available to them, but the final approval or disapproval of these decisions
       rests with the ILCO.
       6.81.2.7. Be the single communication source to FMS customers on SDRs.
       6.81.2.8. Submit the FMS SDR Management Report to SAF according to DLM 4000.25,
       Volume 2, Chapter 17, Section C17.4. and AFJMAN 23-215.
   6.81.3. FMS customers will:
       6.81.3.1. Use the AFSAC Online SDR Submission Wizard tool (automated SF 364
       equivalent) to report shipping, packaging, services, and billing discrepancies and product
       quality deficiencies in SA shipments. A hard-copy of SF 364 can be submitted only if
       web access is not available. An SF 364 and SDR are used interchangeably in this section.
       6.81.3.2. Submit SDRs (electronically or via hard copy SF 364) with supporting
       documentation to the ILCO for processing IAW DLM 4000.25, Chapter 17; AFJMAN
       23-215; and AFMAN 16-101.
   6.81.4. Additional responsibilities can be found in AFMAN 16-101, paragraph 5.10.
6.82. Submission Procedures.
   6.82.1. The ILCO receives all SDRs against FMS shipments IAW the time limit specified in
   the LOA standard terms and conditions. Claims received after the one-year time limit are
   disallowed unless an extended warranty exists on discrepant item, or the ILCO determines
   that unusual and compelling circumstances exist, the most common involving latent defects.
   A latent defect must be substantiated with evidence that a receipt inspection was performed
   and the defect could not be detected at that time and that the defect is present for reasons
   other than deterioration or damage incurred during storage or handling.
       6.82.1.1. FMS countries submitting an SF 364 for deficient materiel under the PQDR
       category (discrepancy code “Q1”) which may be a safety-of-flight deficiency will refer to
       TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 5.
       6.82.1.2. For suspected defective materiel problems which do not meet the SDR
       submission criteria (do not submit an SDR): TCP/IEMP member countries will notify
       the TCG IAW TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 5. Non-TCP/IEMP member countries will notify
       their respective AFSAC CM.
   6.82.2. SDRs for billing discrepancies are submitted no later than one year from the date the
   billing transaction that caused the discrepancy first appeared on the FMS customer's
   quarterly DD Form 645A, Foreign Military Sales Billing Statement.
   6.82.3. SDRs for financial discrepancies (administrative and/or below-the-line accessorial
   costs) will be submitted to the ILCO and forwarded to DFAS-IN/JAXDB Indianapolis for
   processing.
   6.82.4. The FMS customer or his authorized representative prepares and submits SDRs to
   the ILCO IAW the procedures in DLM 4000.25, Volume 2, Chapter 17; AFJMAN 23-215;
   and as implemented by this section. The SDR is submitted to AFLCMC/WFIUB, 5454
   Buckner Road, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433 for AF FMS requisitions.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 147


  6.82.5. AF FMS SDRs are normally submitted electronically via the AFSAC Online SDR
  Submission Wizard. The wizard enables customers to attach applicable release/receipt
  document which accompanied the materiel and any supporting documents to justify the
  claim. If a hard copy SF 364 is provided, it must include applicable supporting documents so
  the ILCO can load the SDR into the online tool for processing.
  6.82.6. The following are some general guidelines for preparing SDR submissions. The
  online wizard will prompt users to provide this information so the block number references
  only apply to hard copy SF 364 submissions.
     6.82.6.1. A unique 5-position report number (ANNNN) must be assigned by country for
     every SDR reported against a master country code/case designator/line item (i.e.,
     CC/KBD/001/T0001).
     6.82.6.2. Avoid the use of the letter “R” in the report number. The letter “R” is reserved
     for ILCO use only to correct any report numbers that are found to be duplicated.
     6.82.6.3. Enter in block 5b the number and date of the vendor's invoice or shipper's bill
     number, not the quarterly billing statement number. Attach a copy of the invoice to SF
     364.
     6.82.6.4. Enter in block 7a the shipment number (when more than one shipment is made
     under a contract requisition) and contract/contract line item number/document number
     (e.g., contract or purchase order). Include the shipment date to distinguish multiple
     shipments from a contractor source.
         6.82.6.4.1. A separate SDR must be submitted for each shipment when multiple
         shipments occur on a requisition.
     6.82.6.5. Enter in block 9c the quantity shown on the applicable release/receipt
     document as being shipped and billed.
     6.82.6.6. Block 12 - Remarks - This block is used for any supplemental information
     when the combination of discrepancy codes and action codes need clarification or when a
     discrepancy needs an explanation.
         6.82.6.6.1. On SDRs involving shortages, the FMS customer will cite whether all
         containers shown as shipped on the issue release/receipt document were received.
         6.82.6.6.2. On SDRs involving non-receipt, the FMS customer must attach a written
         statement from their FF confirming that the shipment has not been received on the
         requisition and TCNs that apply.
         6.82.6.6.3. On SDRs involving damaged materiel, the FMS customer must provide
         evidence that the damage existed before shipment from the SOS or that the damage
         was caused by a packaging deficiency.
         6.82.6.6.4. When reporting PQDRs or damaged materiel, detailed deficiency data
         must be included for investigation purposes. In addition to photographs, test data, and
         related documentation, the following information must be included:
             6.82.6.6.4.1. All information required per DLM 4000.25, Volume 2, paragraph
             C17.5.9. and AFJMAN 23-215, Appendix B, specifically Table B-1, item 10d.
 148                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


              6.82.6.6.4.2. The date deficiency was discovered.
              6.82.6.6.4.3. The item condition: new, repaired or overhauled.
              6.82.6.6.4.4. Operating time at failure.
              6.82.6.6.4.5. The end item the deficient item works on or with.
              6.82.6.6.4.6. Identify the weapon system, if a TCG member, or indicate non-TCG
              member.
              6.82.6.6.4.7. Provide a copy of the serviceable tag, if applicable. Note: FMS
              customers not participating in a TCP/IEMP can submit an SDR for a Category
              (CAT) 1 (safety-of-flight) deficiency IAW TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 5. The FMS
              customer will notify the PM within 72 hours of detection by message or letter of
              deficiencies known or suspected to be the result of mishaps caused by design,
              malfunctions, materiel, quality, software or a deficiency with High Accident
              Potential (HAP) IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. A copy of
              the letter or message sent to the PM must accompany the SDR. The FMS
              customer must hold the deficient materiel pending disposition instructions from
              the ILCO.
6.83. General Processing Procedures.
   6.83.1. The ILCO will electronically transmit the customer’s SDR and attachments through
   DoD WebSDR to the SDR control office for processing within the timelines prescribed by
   DLM 4000.25, Volume 2, paragraphs C17.3.11.2.2.
   6.83.2. The SDR control office will work with the supplier (e.g., IM or contractor) to
   investigate and provide resolution of the SDR. The SDR control office will adhere to the
   timeframes provided in DLM 4000.25, Volume 2, paragraph 17.3.11.4. The purpose of the
   investigation is to:
       6.83.2.1. Determine the validity of the materiel deficiency reported by the FMS
       customer.
       6.83.2.2. Determine, and support by facts and documented evidence, the cause of the
       materiel deficiency.
       6.83.2.3. Determine the corrective measures necessary to prevent repeated discrepancies.
   6.83.3. The investigating organization(s) must give enough details to substantiate their
   recommendation. The investigation results, which include the cause of the materiel
   deficiency, corrective action and recommendation must be documented, signed, dated and
   returned to the SDR control office. The investigation results must be provided with the reply
   to the FMS customer for SDRs reporting quality deficiencies. Neither FMS administrative
   funds nor USG funds and assets are used to absorb the cost of an SDR transaction unless the
   USG is legally determined to be liable for resolution of the SDR.
       6.83.3.1. When it is determined that USG action/inaction caused a discrepant contractor
       shipment (direct cite funded “4F”), a request for credit from administrative funds with
       justification is provided with the investigation results and recommendation to the SDR
       control office.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 149


      6.83.3.2. If item management responsibility for an item has transferred to another
      component after the date of shipment, the Losing Item Manager (LIM) will involve the
      Gaining Item Manager (GIM) in the investigation to validate the item deficiency, obtain
      disposition instructions and purge DoD inventory of any deficient items, if required. All
      action initiated between the LIM and GIM will be provided with the investigation results
      and recommendation to the SDR control office.
   6.83.4. The SDR control office will, based upon the investigating organization's
   recommendation (including the cause and corrective action for a quality deficiency), take one
   of the following actions:
      6.83.4.1. Input reply into DoD WebSDR, using comments/guidance received, to provide
      ILCO with the investigation results. Reply will contain the appropriate disposition reply
      status code(s) and all supporting documents. Reply will be electronically transmitted
      from DoD WebSDR to the ILDO for distribution to the customer. Current disposition
      reply status code listing is available in DLM 4000.25.
      6.83.4.2. If reply contains a request for additional information or for materiel/exhibit
      returns to USG, ILCO will forward request to FMS customer and close SDR pending
      receipt of additional information/materiel. If additional information is not received
      within 45 days, SDR will be denied and automatically closed. If materiel is not returned
      within 180 days, SDR will be denied and automatically be closed.
      6.83.4.3. On validated SDRs, process credits against shipments from stock using the
      same funds as used in the original debit. All direct cite (4F) credits, except delivery
      reporting errors or contract adjustments, are sent to the ILCO with a request from the
      SDR control office for credit from administrative funds with proper justification to be
      reviewed and processed, unless the materiel is returned to AF inventory. When materiel
      is returned to AF inventory, the credit will be accomplished using AF appropriated funds.
          6.83.4.3.1. A delivery reporting transaction processed as a result of SDR action must
          have the SDR number in the NSN field with the appropriate adjustment reply code
          and all requirements of DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15.
   6.83.5. The ILCO will establish a 55-day suspense on each SDR record for obtaining a
   response from the SDR control office. ILCO will systematically transmit a follow-up
   through DoD WebSDR to the SDR control office at 55 days and at 85 days if no response has
   been provided. After the first two electronic follow-ups, monthly follow-ups are sent via E-
   mail to the SDR control offices until a SDR reply/response is received.
6.84. Processing SF 364 by SDR Category.
   6.84.1. Overage or Duplicate Shipment:
      6.84.1.1. If the FMS customer decides to keep the materiel and the FMS customer has
      been billed, approval must be obtained from the ICP/IMM.
          6.84.1.1.1. If the ICP/IMM approves retention, financial adjustment is not necessary.
          The reply approving retention is sent through the ILCO to the FMS customer.
          6.84.1.1.2. If the ICP/IMM disapproves retention, complete disposition instructions
          are provided through the ILCO to the FMS customer. Upon the return of materiel to
          USG custody, credit is processed.
150                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      6.84.1.2. If the FMS customer decides to keep the materiel that has not been billed,
      approval is obtained from the ICP/IMM.
         6.84.1.2.1. If the ICP/IMM approves retention, a debit transaction is processed for
         the materiel. The reply approving retention is sent through the ILCO to the FMS
         customer.
         6.84.1.2.2. If the ICP/IMM disapproves retention, complete disposition instructions
         are provided through the ILCO to the FMS customer. If the materiel is not returned
         within 180 days, the ILCO may request a debit transaction, if appropriate. An
         amended reply is sent to the FMS customer stating that the materiel has not been
         received and a debit for the materiel has processed.
      6.84.1.3. If the FMS customer does not want to keep the materiel, complete disposition
      instructions are provided through the ILCO to the FMS customer.
         6.84.1.3.1. If the materiel is returned within 180 days and the materiel was initially
         billed, credit will be processed.
         6.84.1.3.2. If the materiel is not returned to USG custody within 180 days, a debit
         transaction will be processed, when applicable, to insure the FMS customer is
         charged appropriately for the materiel that was not returned.
  6.84.2. Shortage. Reports of shortage are investigated by using available documentation,
  which is matched to the quantity shipped for the concealed shortage. Examples of such
  documentation are those that contain, but are not limited to, size, total weight, and cube
  accepted by the carrier. Credit is denied if the documentation, in conjunction with the
  individual item unit weight and cube, supports shipment of the total quantity billed.
  Otherwise, appropriate credit for the shortage may be required.
  6.84.3. Wrong Item.
      6.84.3.1. If the FMS customer asks for retention of a wrong item, the SDR control office
      will:
         6.84.3.1.1. Get approval from the ICP/IMM for retention.
         6.84.3.1.2. Verify the cost of the item(s) requisitioned and received.
         6.84.3.1.3. Process a debit transaction, if retention is approved, for the materiel
         received and process a credit transaction for the materiel requisitioned, if applicable.
      6.84.3.2. If the FMS customer does not want to keep the materiel, the ICP/IMM gives
      disposition instructions for the materiel through the ILCO to the FMS customer as
      follows:
         6.84.3.2.1. May authorize local disposal for materiel valued at $500 or less, except in
         the case of HAZMAT. Local disposal of HAZMAT is not authorized.
         6.84.3.2.2. Must direct return of materiel to USG custody if value is more than $500
         except in unusual circumstances where the ICP/IMM determines there is no scrap
         value, or items are unsuitable for transporting, as in the case of unstable ammunition.
      6.84.3.3. A credit transaction is processed for the item requisitioned upon return of
      wrong item.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  151


     6.84.3.4. The following action is taken if the materiel is not returned as directed.
         6.84.3.4.1. If the value of the wrong item exceeds the value of the requisitioned item,
         the wrong item is debited and the requisitioned item is credited.
         6.84.3.4.2. If the value of the wrong item does not exceed the value of the
         requisitioned item, no financial adjustment is necessary.
  6.84.4. Misdirected Shipments.
     6.84.4.1. When a misdirected shipment is reported, the customer or FF that got the
     materiel is provided disposition instructions through the ILCO.
         6.84.4.1.1. If the shipment can be rerouted to the requisitioning customer; no
         financial adjustment is necessary.
         6.84.4.1.2. If the shipment is directed to be returned to a designated turn-in point, a
         DD Form 1348-1A is provided for the return shipment.
     6.84.4.2. If the materiel is not returned within 180 days, the customer that received the
     shipment may be billed and credit may be processed for the initial requisition recipient, if
     known.
  6.84.5. Non-receipt. To deny an SDR for non-receipt of materiel, evidence of shipment is
  provided. Evidence of shipment is a signed carrier's receipt and a DD Form 1348-1A or DD
  Form 250 that identifies the materiel in question. These documents must cross-reference
  each other. Such documents usually show the quantity, NSN, bill of lading number, parcel
  post insured or registered number, name of shipper or carrier.
  6.84.6. Quality Deficiency.
     6.84.6.1. If as a result of the research investigation, there is an indication that the
     contractor caused the deficiency, the contracting office must pursue satisfaction from the
     contractor on behalf of the FMS customer under the provisions of the FAR. The SDR is
     not finalized until all recourse against the contractor is completed. Credit from AF
     appropriated funds or administrative funds are not authorized for a deficient contractor
     shipment (direct cite funded “4F”) unless it is determined that USG error caused the
     deficiency.
     6.84.6.2. When it is determined that the USG is liable for a quality deficiency (stock
     shipment) and the FMS customer wants to repair the item(s) and submits cost of labor
     and materiel to make item(s) serviceable, the cost of labor and materiel is credited by the
     approving ICP/IMM. The cost of repair by the FMS customer cannot exceed the cost of
     repair if the item were repaired by the USG. Credit for repair of materiel shipped from a
     contractor (direct cite funded “4F”) must meet the criteria for approval of administrative
     funds through the ILCO. If the FMS customer wants to return the unserviceable materiel
     for credit, the ICP/IMM must verify the complaint and give disposition instructions for
     the materiel. The ICP/IMM must provide an AF fund cite with disposition instructions
     when directing a contractor shipment (direct cite funded “4F”) back to AF inventory
     (buy-back) for credit. If an exhibit is necessary for analysis to determine if the complaint
     is valid, the exhibit is requested through the SDR control office. When an exhibit is
     returned to a contractor facility written concurrence from the contractor approving the
     return must support the disposition instructions to the SDR control office. The SDR
 152                                                       AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       control office will forward the disposition and supporting documentation to the ILCO.
       The ILCO will send the request for an exhibit to the FMS customer and close the SDR
       waiting for receipt of the exhibit. Once the exhibit is received, the ILCO is notified and
       the SDR is reopened pending results of the investigation. Investigation results are sent to
       the SDR control office and forwarded through the ILCO to the FMS customer.
   6.84.7. Damaged or Improperly Packed Shipment. When it is determined that the damage
   was the fault of the shipping activity, the ICP/IMM will give complete disposition
   instructions. If it is determined that the damage was not the fault of the shipping activity and
   was possibly caused by carrier mishandling, the FMS customer is told to file a claim with the
   carrier. Container damage must be annotated on the carrier's bill of lading at the time it is
   received by the FF. To substantiate a claim against the shipping activity the damage must be
   annotated on the carrier's bill of lading at the time the materiel was released to the carrier.
   6.84.8. Insufficient Shelf-Life. If sufficient shelf-life (IAW DoD 4140.27-M) remained at
   the time of issue, the SDR is denied with appropriate documentation/information. When it is
   determined that the materiel was issued with insufficient shelf-life, the ICP/IMM will give
   disposition instructions and credit, if applicable.
6.85. Returning FMS SDR Materiel to US Government Control. The ICP/IMM is
responsible for providing the return shipping instructions to the SDR control office. The SDR
control office forwards the disposition and investigation results to the ILCO. Materiel is directed
for return by the most economical means available via a DD Form 1348-1A prepared by the
ILCO. An inspection of the shipment is accomplished by the final destination when the SDR
materiel is received. If there is a discrepancy in the returned shipment, the ILCO is advised. The
ILCO will tell the FMS customer and instruct the SDR control office as to what action should be
taken.
   6.85.1. The following procedure applies for the return of approved FMS SDR materiel:
       6.85.1.1. The ILCO, upon receipt of disposition instructions from the SDR control office
       directing materiel return, will transmit an electronic reply to the FMS customer and
       systematically generate a DD Form 1348-1A for customer available via AFSAC Online
       SDR Customer Query. The SDR reply sets up a 180-day return suspense for receipt of the
       materiel into USG custody. The FMS customer must provide the ILCO notification of
       materiel return to USG custody within 180 days.
           6.85.1.1.1. The DD Form 1348-1A will identify as first Destination a US/DoD
           activity that will receive the return shipment from the FMS customer when available.
           When there is no US/DoD activity in the FMS customer country that has the
           capability to receive, store, and transport the discrepant materiel, the first destination
           will be left blank and only the final destination ship to address is provided on the DD
           Form 1348-1A. In this case, the FMS customer will be informed to return the
           materiel prepaid by the most economical means to the final destination address. The
           FMS customer will receive a percentage of the SDR value in transportation
           reimbursement for all approved/validated SDRs. In special circumstances, the FMS
           customer may ask for actual reimbursement for a prepaid shipment by submitting
           receipted bills to the ILCO. All transportation reimbursements are made to the FMS
           customers’ transportation account (L009).
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   153


     6.85.1.2. When the shipment is received at the first destination address, the
     transportation office will sign, indicate the organization/location and date on a legible
     copy of the DD Form 1348-1A. The transportation office will provide two copies of the
     signed/dated DD Form 1348-1A to the FMS customer when requested. The FMS
     customer must send a copy of the signed/dated DD Form 1348-1A or an equivalent
     transportation document (e.g., DD Form 1149, DD Form 1348) to the ILCO as evidence
     the materiel was returned to USG custody. When a shipment is returned by commercial
     means the FMS customer will provide the ILCO proof of delivery evidencing the
     materiel was received at the final destination.
     6.85.1.3. Either materiel return documentation from the FMS customer or SAMIS receipt
     of a “D6E” (asset drop into inventory) transaction will be used as proof that the FMS
     customer has returned discrepant materiel into the USG’s custody. Upon receipt of
     materiel return notification from the FMS customer, the ILCO will upload materiel return
     documentation into the AFSAC Online SDR Automation database and provide materiel
     return notification documentation to the SDR control office. The ILCO also receives an
     E-mail notification when a "D6E" is received in SAMIS and transmits an E-mail
     notification of materiel return to the SDR control office. Both of these notifications
     request SDR control point initiate financial adjustment, if applicable. The adjustment is
     granted only when the FMS customer has placed the materiel in transit within 180 days
     from the return suspense date established when the ILCO prepared the DD Form 1348-
     1A shipping instructions..
     6.85.1.4. The customer has 180 days to notify the ILCO of materiel return. AFSAC
     Online generates E-mail follow-ups to FMS customers reminding them to return FMS
     materiel and provide notification of return to the ILCO at 60 days and 120 days. AFSAC
     provides a 30-day grace period for providing materiel return notifications. If notification
     of materiel return is not provided within 210 days, an E-mail is sent to the FMS customer
     advising them that time has expired to return the materiel and closing the SDR. The SDR
     control office is notified to take credit/debit actions as applicable.
  6.85.2. The following procedure applies when FMS SDR materiel is returned as an exhibit
  for analysis and determination of liability:
     6.85.2.1. The ILCO, upon receipt of disposition instructions from the SDR control office
     directing exhibit return, will transmit an electronic reply to the FMS customer and
     systematically generate a DD Form 1348-1A for customer available via AFSAC Online
     SDR Customer Query. The SDR is closed pending receipt of exhibit from the FMS
     customer. The SDR reply sets up a 180-day return suspense for receipt of the materiel
     into USG custody. The FMS customer must provide the ILCO notification of materiel
     return to USG custody within 180 days. For exhibit returns to contractor facilities,
     customers may be required to expedite return to ensure items are received within
     warranty timeframes. Contractor warranty timeframes may over-ride the 180-day
     timeline on exhibit returns.
        6.85.2.1.1. The exhibit return DD Form 1348-1A will identify as first destination a
        US/DoD activity that will receive shipment from the FMS customer when available.
        When there is no US/DoD activity in the FMS customer country that has the
        capability to receive, store, and transport the discrepant materiel, the first destination
154                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


         will be left blank and only the final destination ship to address is provided on the DD
         Form 1348-1A. In this case, the FMS customer will be told to return the materiel
         prepaid by the most economical means to the final destination address. The FMS
         customer will receive a percentage of the SDR value in transportation reimbursement
         for all approved/validated SDRs. In special circumstances, the FMS customer may
         ask for actual reimbursement for a prepaid shipment by submitting receipted bills to
         the ILCO. All transportation reimbursements will be made to the FMS customers
         transportation account (L009).
             6.85.2.1.1.1. DD Form 1348-1A will be marked “FMS EXHIBIT.” If the exhibit
             is being returned to a contractor, the DD Form 1348-1A must reflect the words
             "Open in the presence of a USG Representative." A name and telephone number
             of the person to be contacted upon receipt of the exhibit will be annotated, if
             available.
      6.85.2.2. When the shipment is received at the first destination address, the
      transportation office will sign, indicate the organization/location and date on a legible
      copy of the DD Form 1348-1A. The transportation office will provide two copies of the
      signed/dated DD Form 1348-1A to the FMS customer when requested. The FMS
      customer must send a copy of the signed/dated DD Form 1348-1A or an equivalent
      transportation document (e.g., DD Form 1149 and DD Form 1348) to the ILCO as
      evidence the exhibit was returned to USG custody. Upon receipt of notification that
      exhibit has been returned to USG custody, ILCO initiates tracer action to track receipt of
      asset from turn-in point to final destination. When a shipment is returned by commercial
      means, the FMS customer will provide the ILCO proof of delivery evidencing the exhibit
      was received at the final destination.
      6.85.2.3. When ILCO confirms via tracing action (or notification from investigating
      activity) that exhibit materiel has been received at final destination, the SDR is re-opened
      and transmitted electronically via DoD WebSDR to the SDR control office pending
      results of the exhibit investigation.
      6.85.2.4. The investigating organization will coordinate scheduling the analysis and
      tracking the materiel once it has been received to ensure materiel is not lost. USG
      investigating organizations must ensure FMS returned exhibits are not posted to AF
      inventory. Exhibits will be handled as non-accountable materiel. The investigating
      organization will conduct an analysis at no cost to the USG. An exhibit will be
      adequately protected and controlled IAW FAR, Part 45. Contractor assistance that may
      result in costs to the USG or the FMS customer must have prior approval from the ILCO
      or the FMS customer.
      6.85.2.5. The SDR control office has 55 days to work with the investing organization to
      validate the FMS customer’s claim and reply with the results of the investigation. The
      ILCO sets a 55-day suspense on each SDR record for obtaining a response from the SDR
      control office. ILCO systematically transmits a follow-up through DoD WebSDR control
      office at 55 days and at 85 days if not response has been provided. After the first two
      electronic follow-ups, monthly follow-ups are sent via E-mail to the SDR control offices
      until a SDR reply/response is received.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  155


      6.85.2.6. When a final action is determined, the SDR control office will input a reply
      into DoD WebSDR, using comments/guidance received to provide ILCO with the
      investigation results. Reply will contain the appropriate disposition reply status code(s)
      and all supporting documents (to include results of the investigation). Reply will be
      electronically transmitted from DoD WebSDR to the ILCO for distribution to the
      customer. Current disposition reply status code listing is available in the DLM 4000.25.
          6.85.2.6.1. If the analysis confirms the reported deficiency, the SDR is approved and
          updated to show what corrective action is being taken. Corrective action will
          normally be taken at no cost to the FMS customer.
          6.85.2.6.2. If the analysis does not confirm the reported deficiency or there is no
          USG/contractor liability for the deficiency, the SDR is denied. If costs were incurred
          to perform the exhibit analysis or the FMS customer authorized repair of the exhibit
          at their expense, action should be taken to make sure that expenses for the analysis or
          repair are charged to the customer's maintenance or services case.
   6.85.3. When the FF or FMS customer receive misdirected shipments, they will contact the
   shipper (depot/contractor) to obtain disposition instructions and funding authority to return
   the shipment.
6.86. Reconsideration/Contested SDRs.
   6.86.1. If the FMS customer disagrees with the initial SDR reply, or if any action occurs
   which justifies additional consideration, the FMS customer will resubmit the SDR complaint
   along with additional justification/information via AFSAC Online SDR Submission Wizard
   tool (automated SF 364 equivalent). A hard-copy SF 364 with additional information
   attached can be submitted only if web access is not available. The customer is authorized 45
   days from the date of the ILCO decision closing the original SDR claim except when
   materiel/exhibit must be re-inspected by the customer to confirm that the reported
   discrepancy/deficiency has been resolved. Under this scenario only, the FMS customer is
   authorized up to 90 days from the date of the final ILCO reply to submit the reconsideration
   SDR.
      6.86.1.1. If SDR meets resubmission guidelines, the ILCO will electronically transmit
      the customer's SDR and attachments through DoD WebSDR to the SDR control office
      for processing. The ILCO has 20 days to process the resubmission SDR. Resubmission
      SDRs will be passed to the SDR control office for decision if the original SDR claim was
      closed by the ILCO.
      6.86.1.2. The SDR control office has 55 days to work with the supplier (e.g. item
      manager or contractor) to investigate and provide resolution of the SDR by inputting a
      reply into DoD WebSDR. ILCO transmits the reply to the customer electronically via
      AFSAC SDR Automation.
   6.86.2. If the FMS customer disagrees with a second denial decision, the SDR is considered
   contested. The FMS customer will resubmit the SDR complaint along with additional
   justification/information via the AFSAC Online SDR Submission Wizard tool (automated SF
   364 equivalent). A hard-copy SF 364 with additional justification attached can be submitted
   only if web access is not available. The customer is authorized 45 days from the date of the
   ILCO decision closing the original SDR claim except when materiel/exhibit return to the
 156                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   customer was required on the original SDR claim. This exception is applicable because
   additional transportation time is necessary for the return shipment and the materiel/exhibit
   must be re-inspected by the customer to confirm that the reported discrepancy/deficiency has
   been resolved. Under this scenario only, the FMS customer is authorized up to 90 days from
   the date of the final ILCO reply to submit the reconsideration SDR.
       6.86.2.1. For contested SDRs, the ILCO has 20 days to develop a sequence of events
       package and forward contested SDR to AFMCLO/JA for legal review and opinion.
       6.86.2.2. Upon receipt of the legal review, the ILCO forwards package valued at $50,000
       or more to SAF/IA for final AF determination. SAF/IA has delegated final determination
       authority for packages valued at less than $50,000 to AFLCMC/WFI IAW AFMAN 16-
       101. SAF/IA has also delegated authority to AFLCMC/WFI to adjudicate all contested
       SDRs submitted without additional evidence, and non-latent defect SDRs that have been
       submitted outside the policy-mandated time frame (45 days from denial of resubmitted
       SDR). “Additional evidence” is defined as official documentation not previously
       submitted by partner nations that supports approval of the SDR.
       6.86.2.3. The ILCO inputs an SDR reply into DoD WebSDR to notify the FMS customer
       of the final AF decision. ILCO transmits the reply to the customer electronically via
       AFSAC SDR Automation.

Section 6K—- NMCS DETERMINATION/REQUISITIONING CRITERIA

6.87. General. Priorities are set up to ensure that those demands having the most serious impact
on mission capability receive priority processing. Everyone must share the responsibility for an
effective and credible priority system. Additional procedural guidance for submission criteria,
initiation, and processing of NMCS requisitions can be found in AFI 23-101, AFMAN 23-122,
and AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 1.
6.88. Determining a NMCS Condition. The customer must first determine when an actual
NMCS condition exists – that is, when a system or end item cannot perform any of its assigned
missions due to a lack of parts. The fact that a given weapon system is inoperative due to the lack
of an item is not enough to justify the use of UND A. UND A may be used only when lack of an
item, required for immediate end-use, prevents an activity from performing its combat or support
missions or tasks, or when such a condition is about to occur or such a condition will occur
within 20 days of the date of the requisition. This should not be confused with mission
impairment (UND B), or stock replenishments and routine shortages (UND C).
   6.88.1. An anticipated NMCS is a condition identified in anticipation of mission-critical
   equipment becoming unserviceable due to a lack of parts, the aircraft going out of service for
   parts, engines going out of service for parts, etc.
6.89. Customer’s Materiel Availability. The customer will ensure that all possible in-country
resources for locating materiel are checked before sending in new NMCS requisitions or
upgrading existing requisitions. The recommended steps are to:
   6.89.1. Identify all I&S and NSN. This may be done by reviewing the I&S data on
   commercially-available electronic research tools.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   157


   6.89.2. Review applicable TOs to identify the Next Higher Assembly (NHA) and any NHA
   I&S applications.
   6.89.3. Do a physical inventory of local, other in-country base, or depot assets for the needed
   item(s), including NHA.
   6.89.4. Determine if cannibalization is possible and practical.
   6.89.5. Determine if the item(s) can be procured via LP or LM.
6.90. Upgrading Existing Requisition. After all resources have been considered and it is
determined that there are no available assets, the customer should determine if there are any
active requisitions, including I&S and NHA NSNs, that can be upgraded to the appropriate
NMCS priority. If so, send an “AM__” transaction with the applicable DCN. Upgrade only the
exact QTY needed to rectify the NMCS condition and send a new requisition for remaining
routine requirements.
6.91. Requisitioning. If there are no active requisitions that can be upgraded, then a new
NMCS requisition must be sent. Requisitions will be in MILSTRIP format.
   6.91.1. There are certain restrictions on customer-generated requisitions and emphasis is
   placed on certain NMCS requisition data elements. Restrictions are placed on the types of
   item that can be requisitioned by the customer on B/O (“E,” FMSO II, “R,” and non-standard
   “E” and “R”) cases. For NMCS situations, these restricted items will be requested via
   priority message, fax, or E-mail to the AFSAC case manager, who will take the necessary
   action to enter requisitions into the system. Restrictions include:
       6.91.1.1. Single-vendor integrity or sole-source items.
       6.91.1.2. Certain classified items.
       6.91.1.3. New and unused items (advice code “6P”).
       6.91.1.4. MDE.
       6.91.1.5. Explosive ordnance items (FSG 13).
       6.91.1.6. Commercial-type items (advice code “3B”).
       6.91.1.7. Modification kits.
       6.91.1.8. Excess defense articles.
       6.91.1.9. Munitions and munitions-related items (MMACs “MN” and “AQ”).
       6.91.1.10. LM or LP items.
       6.91.1.11. Cases or lines needing AFSAC case manager consideration or action, such as:
          6.91.1.11.1. “C” (for CAD/PAD NMCS).
          6.91.1.11.2. “V” or “W” (for modification kits or related items).
          6.91.1.11.3. System-sales cases (“D,” “Q,” “S,” or “Y”).
   6.91.2. Special emphasis should be placed on specific requisition data elements as follows:
       6.91.2.1. QTY (rp 25-29). Only requisition or upgrade the exact quantity needed to meet
       the NMCS condition.
 158                                                   AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       6.91.2.2. Priority (rp 60-61). The priority of the requisition is determined using the
       customer’s authorized F/AD along with the UND. The UND is always “A” for NMCS
       requirements. DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.14, Table AP2-14.T1 gives the F/AD/UND
       matrix for determining the priority.
       6.91.2.3. RDD (rp 62-64). This data element is made up of the following:
          6.91.2.3.1. RP 62 — always “N” for NMCS condition.
          6.91.2.3.2. RP 63 — always “A” (UND).
          6.91.2.3.3. RP 64 — Urgency Justification Code (UJC).
          6.91.2.3.4. The use of expedited handling signal “999” in requisition rp 62-64, RDD,
          is not authorized.
   6.91.3. NMCS requisitions are input to the system by:
       6.91.3.1. The customer transmits the data through DLA Transaction Services or by
       priority message, fax, or E-mail to the AFSAC case manager.
       6.91.3.2. The AFSAC case manager or PM for items received by priority message, fax,
       or E-mail (i.e., “A05,” items restricted from country requisition, etc.).
6.92. Requisition Manager’s Follow-up/Tracking Management.
   6.92.1. The AFSAC requisition manager gets a SAMIS product, Open Requisitions/Custom
   Commitments with ESD and latest status, RCS: MTC-IA(AR)8406 (PCN. U-W001.-HAW),
   which lists all open (unshipped) NMCS requisitions for review each month. This product is
   releasable to the customer upon request. Another SAMIS product (PCN: U-W001-HFD) is
   the NMCS Statistics Report, which shows the quantity of requisitions shipped, the quantity
   of open requisitions by age group, and programmed/non-programmed within the report
   month for each customer.
   6.92.2. Follow-up action is initiated to the customer for verification of all NMCS
   requisitions greater than 30 days old (not having a positive supply status) before making a
   follow-up to the SOS.
   6.92.3. The customer is asked to review the request for verification and identify possible
   candidates to downgrade, which are no longer NMCS requirements. After getting verification
   from the customer, the requisition manager starts follow-up action to the SOS.
   6.92.4. The customer’s NMCS requisition gets special handling under this management idea
   and better support for a valid high priority requirement.
   6.92.5. CLSSA FMSO II programmed requisitions get priority treatment over non-
   programmed requisitions. Non-programmed requisitions, including NMCS, are not usually
   supplied using AF/CLSSA on hand-on order stocks.
6.93. Customer Management Tips.
   6.93.1. The customer can help to make sure he or she receives good logistics support for his
   or her NMCS requisitions by developing and enforcing in-country procedures such as:
       6.93.1.1. Ensuring all possible sources for locating materiel in country are exhausted
       before sending or upgrading NMCS requisitions.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 159


     6.93.1.2. Ensuring the assignment of NMCS coding is appropriate for NMCS conditions
     (reference AFH 23-123, Volume 1).
     6.93.1.3. Sending in critical requirements as quickly as possible. This applies to both
     NMCS and anticipated NMCS conditions.
     6.93.1.4. Forecasting requirements for expense and investment items on FMSO I case for
     programmed support.
     6.93.1.5. Telling AFSAC immediately of changes in NMCS, if no longer needed, or
     submitting an “AM__” to downgrade the requisition.
     6.93.1.6. Providing the following verification data to AFSAC to justify the NMCS
     requirement, upon submission to include:
         6.93.1.6.1. Information to substantiate immediate action;
         6.93.1.6.2. Cite the weapon system and impact;
         6.93.1.6.3. Cite the immediate quantity required; and
         6.93.1.6.4. Any additional information to substantiate an expedited action.
     6.93.1.7. Ensuring requisitions are correctly submitted. Programmed requisition support
     is more aggressively managed than non-programmed supported requisitions. The
     CLSSA participants should complete their FMSO II case requisitions correctly in order
     for them to be coded programmed.
         6.93.1.7.1. Expense-item requisitions (ERRCs “N” and “P”) will be coded
         programmed by SAMIS if they have a recurring demand code (“R” or blank in rp 44).
         6.93.1.7.2. Investment-item requisitions will be coded programmed by SAMIS if:
             6.93.1.7.2.1. The item is on the FMSO I.
             6.93.1.7.2.2. The requisition is a recurring demand (“R” or blank in rp 44).
             6.93.1.7.2.3. The requisition quantity is less than or equal to the EPQ. The
             current EPQ is provided to the CLSSA participant on the Monthly CLSSA EPQ
             Forecast Notice (GBJ).
  6.93.2. The key to reducing the number of NMCS requisitions is to get and maintain a well-
  balanced stock position and ensure that stock-replenishment requisitions are submitted in a
  timely manner. Continued emphasis on stock replenishment will reduce the necessity for
  priority requisitioning.
  6.93.3. Abuse of the MILSTRIP priority system creates many high-priority requisitions,
  which could overload the system. If this happens, priority requisitions could then be treated
  as routine. Customer cooperation in the correct use of the priority system is essential.

7.1. Overview. Per DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 11, prior to FY 1982, defense articles
and services provided to allied governments or international organizations by GA were
administered through the MAP. There are still some open FMS cases that use MAP funds. The
policy and/or procedures in DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Section C11.HR.1 are to be followed for
these cases.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    161

Section 8A—FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) CONTRACTOR ENGINEERING AND
TECHNICAL SERVICES (CETS)

8.1. Overview. This section provides guidance, methods and procedures used for a CETS
program in support of FMS customers. Services for CETS are obtained and governed IAW
AFMAN 16-101 and AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Services.
8.2. Scope. The CETS are services which transfer contractor engineering and technical
knowledge to help customers in the installation, operation, and maintenance of
equipment/systems purchased under FMS. These are services done by contractors at designated
work sites in-country. CETS are available through FMS to advise, instruct, and train customer
personnel to install, operate, and maintain specific new AF furnished weapons, equipment, and
systems until the purchaser can gain self-sufficiency. As a rule, CETS under AFI 21-110 are not
sold under FMS unless it is not practical for the customer to get them directly from the
contractor.
8.3. Customer Requests for CETS.
   8.3.1. This service is usually part of the initial system sale (“D,” “Q,” “S,” or “Y” case).
   Follow-on support, if needed, can come from a D/O services (“G” or “Q”) case.
       8.3.1.1. System Sales. Requests for the purchase of a weapon system come from the
       customer and are sent to SAF/IA.
       8.3.1.2. Follow-on support. Requests for CETS under FMS “G” or “Q” cases are sent by
       the customer directly to the applicable AFSAC CCM.
       8.3.1.3. Country LORs for CETS personnel will include:
          8.3.1.3.1. A specified source, if applicable with justification IAW DSCA Manual
          5105.38-M, Chapter 6.
          8.3.1.3.2. A Task Work Specification (TWS) as defined in AFI 21-110, Attachment
          2. The TWS will also include:

                  component personnel on installation, maintenance and operating techniques
                  pertaining to the adjustment, calibration, trouble-shooting, bench check,
                  routine maintenance, inspection and repair of the prime equipment/system.
                  8.3.1.3.2.1.2. Provide advice in the identification of and instruction on the use
                  of special tools, handling equipment, Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE)
                  and test equipment associated with and related to equipment/systems.
                  8.3.1.3.2.1.3. Devise local informal training programs and provide advice in
                  identifying needed training programs.

   8.4.2. AFLCMC/WFG will:
       8.4.2.1. Serve as the major activity procuring contracting officer.
       8.4.2.2. Procure, manage, and administer CETS contracts for FMS customers.
       8.4.2.3. Send copies of all contracts to the AFSAC CETS process owner.
       8.4.2.4. Send billings to DFAS-AIQ/DY.
       8.4.2.5. Inform the AFSAC CETS process owner when services and billings are
       completed.
   8.4.3. The FMS customer will:
       8.4.3.1. Send LOR for CETS IAW paragraph 8.3              Customers will ensure LOR is
       complete in order to prevent processing delays.
       8.4.3.2. Sign and fund the LOA without delay to prevent possible lapse of coverage.
       This is extremely important for follow-on “G” or “Q” cases, since contractors are not
       obligated to stay in country without a contract in effect.
       8.4.3.3. Provide all necessary in-country support as stated in the TWS.
       8.4.3.4. Give performance certification in the absence of an AFCO.
8.5. Procurement.
   8.5.1. Customer Wait Time.
       8.5.1.1. Depending on the FMS customer and contract negotiations, the average overall
       CWT is 240-330 days (8 to 11 months). Normal CWTs to process a LOA are 90-120
       days, for OA/implementation 30 days, and for contract negotiations 120-180 days.
       Therefore due to the lengthy process, initiation of follow-on cases/LOAs needs to begin
       nine months before the performance start date. A contract cannot be awarded until a
       signed LOA is received and funds are available. CETS personnel cannot be assigned in-
       country until the contract is awarded.
       8.5.1.2. The CWT can be greatly reduced if the customer provides a comprehensive
       TWS or SOW to go along with the LOR. This action allows the AFSAC CETS process
       owner to prepare and send a planning PR to AFLCMC/WFG so that preliminary
       contractual actions can move ahead at the same time as LOA preparation and processing.
       This usually allows the contract to be negotiated and made ready for award when the
       signed LOA and funds are received. Contract charges (billings) are not made until CETS
       personnel are assigned in-country.
   8.5.2. Contracting.
       8.5.2.1. AFLCMC/WFG acts as the Procurement Contracting Office (PCO) and the
       ACO IAW AFI 21-110 for CETS contracts on behalf of the AF and FMS customers.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    165


       8.5.2.2. Once the ACO prepares AF Form 1293, Request and Authorization for
       Assignment and Relocation of Contractor Personnel, CETS personnel are considered
       assigned. At the same time, the ACO provides a letter to the USG agency in-country
       giving the name of the individual(s), contract number and travel order number. The
       CETS representatives are now contractually authorized to leave for their in-country
       assignment.
       8.5.2.3. The ACO sends a copy of the AFCO handbook to the USG agency in-country to
       help them in the performance of their duties.
       8.5.2.4. The ACO must coordinate on all assignments and changes with the contractor
       and AFSAC. The ACO gets the Certificate of Service (COS) which states that the
       required services were actually performed. The COS is the basis for payment to the
       contractor. No payment will be made unless the COS has been properly prepared and
       approved by both CETS personnel and certified by the authorized AFCO.

Section 8B—FMS EXCESS MATERIEL RETURN (FEMR) PROGRAM

8.6. Overview. Under the FEMR program, FMS customers may identify FMS purchased
articles as excess to their requirements and offer them to the AF for return with credit. The AF
will review its stock level/buy position and may give approval for the return of part or all excess
items. Per AFI 23-101, Chapter 2, AF may buy back FMS excesses for AF use in return for
credit.
8.7. FEMR Description.
   8.7.1. AF-managed materiel, which was originally acquired through an FMS program and
   has become excess to a country's need, may be offered to AFMC for credit. The country
   initiates an offer by submitting an “FTE,” Report of Excess, through the DLA Transaction
   Services. The request will be passed to the IM’s Wholesale Requisition Process (D035A).
   There are subsequent communications regarding the request between the country and IM via
   “FT_” transactions using various excess Document Identifier Codes (DIC). Refer to AFH
   23-123, Volume 2, Part 1 and AFMCMAN 23-5 (when published) for excess DICs and
   “FT_” transaction formats.
   8.7.2. Prior to granting credit for the return, a requirement must exist within the AF at the
   time the report of excess is received. All requests for excess materiel return will be
   processed on a case-by-case basis and must meet specific criteria. The criteria are found in
   paragraph 8.8.
   8.7.3. All FMS customers are eligible to participate in the program. FMS cases are not
   created or credited via FEMR transactions. Credit for authorized returns will be deposited in
   the FMS customer’s holding account at DFAS –IN/JAXDB(Indianapolis) after the items are
   physically received.
8.8. Eligible Materiel. Materiel reported must:
   8.8.1. Meet the criteria listed in AFI 23-101, Chapter 2.
   8.8.2. Be assigned a “F_Z” RIC on “FTE” transactions. Only materiel managed by AFMC
   is eligible for FEMR.
 166                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   8.8.3. Be assigned SCCs:
       8.8.3.1. “A,” “B,” or “C” for serviceable consumable/economic order quantity (ERRC
       codes “N” or “P”) materiel.
       8.8.3.2. “A,” “B,” “C,” “F,” or “G” for serviceable or unserviceable (reparable)
       investment items, ERRC code “T” and equipment items ERRC codes “S” or “U.” Note:
       ERRCs are explained in AFH 23-123, Volume 1. SCCs are defined in DLM 4000.25-2,
       Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP),
       Appendix 2.05..
8.9. Processing Return Requests.
   8.9.1. Customers submit requests to return excess materiel by transmitting an “FTE,” Report
   of Excess, via DLA Transaction Services. The transaction will be routed to the managing
   SOS. A separate “FTE” is required for each NSN and SCC reported.
   8.9.2. If the SOS is delayed in processing the “FTE,” it will transmit an “FTD,” Delayed
   Disposition Instructions, to the customer. RPs 70-73 of the “FTD” will show the date by
   which final disposition instructions will be sent.
   8.9.3. An “FTQ,” Customer Report of Excess Reporting Document via DLA Transaction
   Services, will be sent to the customer if an “FTE” must be rerouted. RPs 4-6 of the “FTQ”
   will identify the SOS to which the “FTE” was rerouted. All future communication will be
   directed to that SOS.
   8.9.4. The SOS responsible for managing the item will answer with an “FTR,” Shipment-
   Directed Disposition of Excess. Customer asset reporting transaction status code “TA” or
   “TH” in rp 65-66 is authorization to return the QTY in rp 25-29 to the activity listed in rp 54-
   56. Refer to DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.16. or AFH 23-123, Volume 1 for a complete list
   of customer asset reporting transaction status codes. Do not ship materiel if a “TB” customer
   asset reporting transaction status code is in rp 65-66 of the “FTR.” Return without credit is
   not part of the FEMR program. The priority code in rp 61-62 indicates the urgency of the AF
   need for the item. Expedited processing is requested for materiel with high priority.
   8.9.5. If an “FTR” or an “FTD” response has not been received within 30 days of
   transmitting an “FTE,” the customer transmits an “FTF,” Excess Follow-up.
   8.9.6. If the “FTR” authorizes return with a customer asset reporting transaction status code
   “TA” or “TH” in rp 65-66 the customer must send an “FTL”, Excess Supply Shipment
   Status, providing the estimated date materiel will be shipped to the SOS.
   8.9.7. After the materiel is shipped with the shipment documented on the DD Form 1348-
   1A, the FMS customer will submit an “FTM,” Excess Shipment Status, to inform the SOS of
   the actual shipping data, including the date that the shipment was released to the carrier, the
   TCN, and the mode of transportation. The date of the “FTM” must be after the ship date of
   the materiel. The ship date is in rp 57-59 of the “FTM.” A ship date after the “FTM” date
   will cause the system to automatically cancel processing of the credit. Send questions
   regarding credit cancellations to the responsible IMS. The customer will also annotate
   “FEMR Shipment” and date of FTR authorization on the DD Form 13480-1A.
   8.9.8. The customer will process an “FTC,” Report of Customer Excess Cancellation,
   whenever any of the following conditions are met:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    167


     8.9.8.1. It is determined after the “FTE” has been submitted that the materiel is not
     available for shipment.
     8.9.8.2. The “FTR” authorizes return and the condition of the materiel is not the same as
     reported on the “FTE.” If the customer still wants to return the excess, a new “FTE”
     must be submitted using a new DCN and the correct SCC.
     8.9.8.3. The QTY authorized by the “FTR” is not available for shipment. The “FTC”
     will show the QTY in rp 25-29 being canceled or denied.
  8.9.9. The SOS will send an “FT6,” ICP Follow-up, to the customer if an “FTL” or an
  “FTM” has not been received within 30 days after the “FTR” authorizing return of the
  materiel. The customer’s response to the “FT6” is the same as the response to an “FTR” (see
  paragraph 8.9.7). The customer will immediately transmit an “FTL” and must ship the
  materiel and send an “FTM” within 45 days after receiving an “FT6.”
  8.9.10. Upon receipt of the materiel, the SOS will send an “FTZ,” ICP Materiel Receipt
  Status, informing the customer of the receipt of the materiel and the amount of the credit
  which will be granted. Paragraph 8.9.13. lists reasons for less-than-full or denial of credit for
  materiel received.
  8.9.11. The FMS customer will transmit an “FTT,” ICP Materiel Receipt Status Follow-up,
  if an “FTZ” is not received within 30 days after the estimated date the materiel should have
  been received at the SOS. This transaction is very important to prevent cancellation of credit
  authorization because if the shipment is not received within 120 days after the “FTM,” the
  SOS is authorized to cancel credit using an “FTR” with “TP” customer asset reporting
  transaction status code.
  8.9.12. The customer will send an “FTP,” Follow-up for Credit, to the SOS if credit is not
  received within 180 days after receipt of the “FTZ.” Credits for excess returns are shown on
  the holding account summary which is included with quarterly billing statement (DD Form
  645A) from DFAS-IN/JAXDB.
  8.9.13. Credit authorization can be cancelled if:
     8.9.13.1. An “FTM” shipment status is not received within 45 days after the date that an
     “FT6” is sent by the SOS.
     8.9.13.2. The materiel is not received at the SOS within 120 days after the “FTM”
     shipment status is sent by the customer (customer asset reporting transaction status code
     “TP”).
     8.9.13.3. The materiel received at the SOS is other than that authorized for return
     (customer asset reporting transaction status code “TL”).
     8.9.13.4. The condition of the materiel received at the SOS is other than that originally
     reported (customer asset reporting transaction status code “TM”).
     8.9.13.5. The QTY of materiel received at the SOS is other than authorized for return.
     Direct questions concerning credit amounts to the responsible IMS.
  8.9.14. If credit authorization is withdrawn, the customer must send disposition instructions
  and transportation funds to return the materiel to customer’s depot or to process the materiel
168                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


  to disposal. If sent to disposal, the scrap value of the materiel will be determined by DLA
  Distribution Services and credited to the customer’s holding account.
  8.9.15. All “FT_” transactions will be transmitted via DLA Transaction Services whenever
  possible (media and status code “2” in rp “7”). If DLA Transaction Services means are not
  available, the transactions may be sent in proper format by letter or message directly to the
  SOS. DD Form 1348M is the basic format for the “FT_” transactions.
  8.9.16. Packaging and transportation costs for returning the materiel to the SOS are the
  responsibility of the FMS customer returning the assets. The level of packaging will be equal
  to the mode of shipment IAW DLM 4000.25-1. All transportation costs will be prepaid to
  the SOS location.
  8.9.17. The amount credited for the items shall be determined as follows:
      8.9.17.1. Credit for stock fund items (ERRC codes “N” and “P”) will be the latest
      acquisition cost.
      8.9.17.2. Serviceable investment items (ERRC code “T”) will be the latest acquisition
      cost.
      8.9.17.3. Unserviceable investment items will be credited based upon the current stock
      list price and the average repair cost of that type item. Normally, the amount credited
      will be the current stock list price minus the average repair cost. However, if no average
      repair cost is available, credit will be 60 percent of the current stock list price.
  8.9.18. Credited amounts from AF activities are sent by check with supporting
  documentation directly to DFAS-IN/JAXDB for deposit into the returning customer’s “4DD”
  holding account. The “4DD” deposit is accomplished with reference to pseudo case “XLC.”
  DFAS sends each FMS customer a quarterly statement of the holding account along with
  supporting documentation.
  8.9.19. An FMS customer requesting authorization to return excess materiel or requiring
  resolution of a problem will communicate directly with the SOS responsible for the items
  regarding all routine matters. The problem resolution process is as follows:
      8.9.19.1. Completely document the problem and send an E-mail to the responsible IMS.
      8.9.19.2. Problems not resolved by an E-mail to the IMS should be fully described in a
      letter to the SOS responsible for the item. Include copies of all shipping and receipt
      documents with the letter.
      8.9.19.3. If all reasonable efforts are made through these channels and the problem
      cannot be resolved, it will be fully documented and sent to AFSAC CCM for research
      and fact-finding. If the problem cannot be resolved with the resources available to
      AFSAC personnel, the documented problem will be elevated and passed to HQ
      AFMC/A4RM for their action. The answer will be passed to the FMS customer through
      AFSAC. Requests for meetings and conferences between the FMS customer and HQ
      AFMC/A4RM will be sent to the AFSAC CCM.
      8.9.19.4. Problems must be identified in writing to the AFSAC Command County
      Manager within two years of the shipment date as shown in the “FTM.”
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                     169


Section 8C—FMS SUPPORT OF AIR FORCE-DEACTIVATED SYSTEMS AND FMS
CUSTOMER SYSTEM/ITEM SUPPORT TERMINATION

8.10. Purpose and Scope. This section establishes procedures for logistics support for AF-
origin systems which are no longer part of the active AF inventory, but are still in an FMS
customer's active inventory.
8.11. General.
   8.11.1. The AF is committed to logistically supporting weapon systems provided to
   countries through the SAP for the period of their expected service life. The service life of
   systems operated by FMS customers often extends beyond the service life of AF-operated
   systems. Because the AF logistics support system is structured to support active AF systems,
   the nature and method of AF logistics support for foreign operated systems will likely evolve
   following system phase-out by the AF.
   8.11.2. Many FMS weapon systems are operated in multiple configurations by more than
   one foreign AF. FMS customers establish logistics support structures based on their
   individual assessments of need. Factors that determine FMS customers choices can include:
   the number of systems, technical capability, operational mission, resource availability,
   maintenance concepts, and expected service life. Because these factors differ for each
   customer, AF-provided support should be flexible in satisfying individual customer needs.
   8.11.3. AF deactivation of a weapon system will affect AF's ability to provide continued
   logistics support to FMS customer systems. Standard FMS support procedures will require
   modification in light of AF's diminishing logistics infrastructure and will often require a shift
   from organic to contractual support.
   8.11.4. To minimize potential negative impact on FMS customer support, planning for
   deactivated system support must commence prior to AF system phase-out. This planning
   effort must include the FMS customer(s) and all AF/DoD agencies that are part of the
   logistics support infrastructure.
8.12. Guidance.
   8.12.1. When the AF decides to phase-out a system, the PM will develop a logistics support
   plan for FMS customers. This plan will outline all actions, authorizations, guidance, and
   resources needed to support FMS customers. Specific AF organizational responsibilities are
   in paragraph 8.20. Plan implementation will be coordinated with impacted AFMC, AF, and
   DoD organizations and FMS customers.
   8.12.2. The AF will offer assistance to FMS customers as they transition from standard AF
   support to alternative support options. Available support options will be dependent on a
   number of factors to include: weapon system inventory and age, AF spares inventory,
   commercial supportability and country financial resources.
   8.12.3. The AF will normally inform FMS customers two years prior to the planned phase-
   out date of AF systems.
   8.12.4. Support of standard items common to other active AF systems will continue through
   normal AF/DoD logistics support mechanisms.
 170                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   8.12.5. Support of items peculiar to the deactivated weapon system will be based on the
   support option selected by the FMS customer.
   8.12.6. The AF will not normally provide logistics support for deactivated systems under the
   following conditions:
       8.12.6.1. An FMS customer has been offered deactivated system support and has not
       accepted the offer.
       8.12.6.2. An FMS customer initially accepted the equipment as is with no AF support
       responsibility.
       8.12.6.3. An FMS customer is ineligible for follow-on logistic support.
       8.12.6.4. An FMS customer's systems/equipment was purchased directly from
       commercial sources and modified to other than AF standard configuration.
   8.12.7. As systems age, manufacturing sources for individual system items and components
   tend to diminish. FMS customers must be notified in a timely manner to effectively consider
   available support options that may include Life-of-Type (LOT) item “buy-outs,” upgraded or
   modified systems, or suitable substitute items.
   8.12.8. When a system is deactivated from the AF inventory, a one-time inventory buy-out
   of peculiar items will be offered to FMS customers. Such offers will expire after two years.
   Item prices may be discounted according to guidance contained in DoD 7000.14-R, Volume
   15. After the buy-out offer period expires, the following support options are available to
   FMS customers:
       8.12.8.1. FMS non-standard support through the PROS.
       8.12.8.2. A LOT buy for a complete range and depth of peculiar spares.
       8.12.8.3. Direct commercial arrangements
       8.12.8.4. FMS contractual support arrangements for support not available through
       standard FMS procedures.
       8.12.8.5. FMS purchase of another country's excess items through the WWRS program.
       Details on the WWRS program can be found in AFMAN 16-101.
8.13. Responsibilities.
   8.13.1. AFSAC will:
       8.13.1.1. Present support options to FMS customers.
       8.13.1.2. Plan and develop FMS cases to support FMS options selected by customers.
       8.13.1.3. Present PM-prepared list of recommended spares in response to FMS customer
       requests for LOT buy information. Monitor the results of support options selected by
       FMS customers to assess whether support is adequate.
   8.13.2. PM will:
       8.13.2.1. Inform FMS customers and AFSAC about planned system phase-out date. If
       feasible, inform FMS customers at least two years prior to the planned phase-
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 171


     out/deactivation date. This advance notice will allow customers adequate time to plan
     and budget for support transition. The notification will include:
         8.13.2.1.1. Available support options.
         8.13.2.1.2. Recommendations for future support.
         8.13.2.1.3. Anticipated difficulties in supporting/maintaining particular items,
         components, etc.
         8.13.2.1.4. Availability of engineering and technical support services, special tooling
         and special test equipment, technical data, etc.
     8.13.2.2. Determine from the worldwide aircraft inventory data system, and any other
     means, FMS customers needing support for equipment phasing out of the AF inventory.
     8.13.2.3. Develop a responsive support plan.
     8.13.2.4. Develop a list of peculiar spares and SE for an inventory buy-out offer when
     the FMS customer has decided upon a support plan. Customers may develop their own
     list of requirements. Send the recommended list to IMs to ensure the items are used
     exclusively by the FMS customer. The PM will inform the item managers to recode all
     peculiar items with acquisition advice code “P” (FMS only). This list will be used by
     IMs to re-catalog these items with the appropriate non-standard MMAC after expiration
     of the two year buy-out offer period.
     8.13.2.5. Send the validated listings to AFSAC for use in preparing LOAs, if applicable.
     8.13.2.6. Inform AFSAC when the system is no longer considered logistically
     supportable.
  8.13.3. IMs will:
     8.13.3.1. Receive lists of on-hand assets for deactivated systems and check them to
     ensure there are no known DoD users.
     8.13.3.2. Determine items used exclusively by FMS customers but no longer used by
     DoD and start action to recode items with acquisition advice code “P” until an
     appropriate non-standard MMAC is assigned after expiration of the two-year buyout
     offer.
     8.13.3.3. Return validated lists of FMS peculiar items for deactivated systems to the PM
     and retain a copy for future catalog action.
     8.13.3.4. Review common items once a year to determine whether items should move to
     non-standard status and send a list of items to be cataloged as non-standard to the PM to
     determine support impacts.
     8.13.3.5. Retain FMS active items (i.e., those items with FMS demands in past four
     years) no longer used by DoD. PMs will notify the IMs whether customers have
     accepted or rejected the support plan, and will dispose of inactive items (i.e., those with
     no demands in past four years) after assets have been offered to the FMS customers.
     8.13.3.6. Ensure items are priced according to guidance contained in DoD 7000.14-R,
     Volume 15.

       8.13.3.7. Retain FMS peculiar assets covered by an HQ AFMC/A4 disposal freeze and
       not requisitioned by an FMS customer until the freeze is terminated.
   8.13.4. FMS customers will:
       8.13.4.1. Upon notification that an item is being superseded or otherwise terminated,
       decide whether a LOT buy for that item is advisable, and if so, submit requisitions using
       advice code “2B.” If requisitions for superseded items are rejected, request price and
       availability data for the items or a LOT buy. If stock assets are no longer available
       through AF, price and availability data will be based on commercial acquisition costs.
       IMs can provide the name of the last known commercial source.
       8.13.4.2. Cover applicable costs associated with the purchase of non-standard assets that
       have never been procured or tested by the USAF. It will be a customer determination to
       call off the sale when such costs are considered prohibitive.
8.14. Major End items and Subsystems.
   8.14.1. Major end items and subsystems are often modified to improve operational
   capabilities, extend service life, eliminate safety hazards, and enhance reliability and
   maintainability. Notification of pending and approved modifications is usually provided to
   foreign customers through various FMS engineering/service programs such as the weapon
   system TCP or the IEMP. The notification identifies any applicable supportability concerns
   (i.e., the availability of technical data, replacement assets, AF repair, and SE) should
   customers opt not to incorporate the modification.
   8.14.2. The PM will inform customers through the TCG (if one exists) when a modification
   is approved for offer. For those customers who decline to adopt the modification, the PM
   will identify those customers requiring non-standard support or an alternative support plan.
   Services rendered by the PM to provide an alternative support plan that entails a non-routine
   level of effort should be charged directly back to the customer through an appropriate FMS
   case.
   8.14.3. Items removed from systems as a result of a modification action that are no longer
   used by DoD are offered for sale to customers that do not accomplish the modification.
   Items identified as deactivated (no longer used by DoD) will be re-cataloged with AAC “P”
   to prevent replenishment of stock and removal from CLSSA. The appropriate non-standard
   MMAC will be assigned after the items have been offered to the user, usually two years after
   the date they were coded AAC “P.” The two-year period allows customers time to budget
   for the purchase of replacement items.

Section 8D—NON-STANDARD ITEM SUPPORT

8.15. Overview. This section explains non-standard support and includes responsibilities for
initial and follow-on logistics support of non-standard items. This guidance is for all AF
activities developing, implementing, and managing system/subsystem sales and all follow-on
logistics support requirements.
8.16. Definition.
   8.16.1. A non-standard item is an item that is not in DoD or GSA inventories or bought on a
   continuing basis for regular use by DoD activities. A non-standard item may range from a
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                173


   major end article to an individual part of a component or assembly and may or may not have
   an assigned NSN or other stock number. Additional non-standard terms are:
      8.16.1.1. Non-standard system or subsystem is one that the DoD does not have in its
      current inventory or that the DoD does not manage for its own use. This includes FMS-
      customer-used systems and subsystems no longer used by the AF, FMS customer unique
      configurations of like-AF-used systems and subsystems, and FMS customer unique
      systems and subsystems never used by the AF.
      8.16.1.2. Non-standard items-of-supply are spares, spare parts, and equipment items not
      stocked, stored, issued, maintained, or otherwise bought for regular use by the AF. This
      would include items matched only to manufacturers' part or reference numbers, “ND”
      stock numbers, inactive NSNs, non-listed NSNs and NSNs identified for FMS customer
      use only. Non-standard items of supply are items no longer used or never used in DoD,
      and can also be for item requirements in support of active DoD used systems/subsystems
      that for some reason or another were never cataloged in the federal supply catalog
      system.
      8.16.1.3. Non-standard logistics support consists of non-standard item materiel
      acquisition, provisioning, cataloging, technical data management, engineering/technical
      services, maintenance/repair, and configuration accounting. Country standard support is
      a form of non-standard support that applies only to a specific FMS customer (e.g., TO)
      and imbedded software).
8.17. Scope.
   8.17.1. The advantages of system/subsystem standardization are substantial; therefore, the
   sale of non-standard configurations, services, and materiel will be minimized. The existence
   of non-standard item support procedures should not be seen as AF blanket approval or
   encouragement to sell non-DoD used articles through FMS programs.
   8.17.2. The AF will provide logistics support for all configurations of items sold through
   FMS. This includes both initial and follow-on support except:
      8.17.2.1. The AF will not provide non-standard support for items or configurations
      previously provided through the SAP that have been changed or reengineered by the
      foreign customer through their own organic or contracting efforts. When the FMS
      customer changes an article through their own initiative, they also assume responsibility
      for any unique support requirements as well as integrating any technical information into
      their technical order and configuration management systems. The AF must still advise
      the FMS customer of modifications to the AF used system/subsystem configuration, but
      the FMS customer must determine its applicability.
      8.17.2.2. The AF will not provide non-standard support for items or systems provided
      through FMS programs when the terms and conditions of the LOA state that initial and/or
      follow-on support for all or part of the sale will not be provided by the AF.
      8.17.2.3. The AF will not provide non-standard support for items bought by FMS
      customers that were not obtained through DoD SAPs or procedures.
 174                                                   AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   8.17.3. Exceptions to these prohibitions may be made if approved or directed by DSCA.
   The AF may be asked to give non-standard support for systems/subsystems under the
   following:
       8.17.3.1. A system sale LOA must specify that the AF will provide initial and/or follow-
       on logistics support for any non-standard system/subsystem that may be included. The
       LOA must show the non-standard system/subsystem and describe how much non-
       standard support is needed.
       8.17.3.2. DSCA approval is needed for any LOAs that have follow-on non-standard
       support requirements that were not identified during an initial system sale negotiation.
       DSCA approval is needed for follow-on support LOAs which have non-standard
       requirements that were not part of an FMS system/subsystem acquisition.
       Systems/subsystems bought by FMS customers through procedures other than FMS may
       be supported through follow-on FMS cases if DoD agrees or directs such action.
8.18. System Sales Non-standard Item Support.
   8.18.1. FMS customers should strive to buy systems and subsystems that have the same
   configurations and support requirements as those used in the AF. Because of technology
   transfer restrictions and US national security considerations, not every item used in DoD is
   releasable for FMS programs. When item release restrictions are applied, commercial items
   or alternate configurations may have to be used making the FMS system/subsystem
   configuration non-standard to that used in DoD. FMS customers, for reasons of their own,
   may however ask for items, subsystems, or configurations not used in DoD or not used in the
   same DoD applications to be part of an FMS case. This makes the FMS customer’s
   system/subsystem non-standard.
   8.18.2. After getting a LOR for a system sale, the AF will prepare LOAD studies to develop
   cost estimates and the terms and conditions of sales. AFMC program offices are tasked with
   developing data for non-standard items and configurations included in the system. Product
   divisions provide new production system data (i.e., aircraft, missiles, communication-
   electromagnetic, etc.) and developmental SE data requirements. AFSAC acts in conjunction
   with the PM, IM, and IMS to get the necessary LOAD.
   8.18.3. When a system sale includes non-standard support requirements, the FMS customer
   is encouraged to make an up-front determination as to whether non-standard logistics support
   will be through FMS procedures or through direct commercial sources. This decision bears
   directly on AF support planning and data development in LOAD studies. The AF will state
   its specific logistics support responsibility and way of accomplishment through a LOAD
   study within 40 days after DSCA approval of the system sale request. If responsibility for
   non-standard logistics support cannot be determined because the customer cannot decide the
   LOAD must have a statement saying such support will be determined before LOA
   implementation at a joint customer/AF conference (that is, post acceptance review,
   definitization, provisioning, etc.). Initial and follow-on non-standard logistics support
   programs for FMS unique systems and configurations will be designed and managed by
   AFMC along with the system procuring activity (i.e., AFLCMC) and performed by contracts
   let by the PM and/or SOS IM.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  175


  8.18.4. Normal relationships between AFMC subsystem and system managers will be set up
  except where permanent or ICS has been arranged by an AFLCMC Weapon System Program
  Office. Usually managers of avionics, engines, ground SE, etc., are responsible for providing
  logistics support for non-standard subsystems included in a system sale.
  8.18.5. The following describes some of the considerations and actions for developing data
  for non-standard items on a system sale:
     8.18.5.1. Non-standard initial spares for a system sale will only be on LOAD/LOA line
     items separate from those of standard spares. Since exact configurations and internal
     compositions of non-standard articles are not always known at the time of LOAD
     development, an accurate price estimate of the non-standard part of the spares
     requirement may not be possible unless an identical system/configuration has recently
     been provided through FMS. When a non-standard spares line item is to be included in
     the system sale, the assigned line item value will be a reasonable price estimate to be
     amended when a more exact cost can be determined (usually during the provisioning
     conference).
     8.18.5.2. The PM, with input from the IM, will ask the system procurement activity
     (usually an AFLCMC Program Executive Office [PEO]) to provide a narrative comment
     to show if each non-standard subsystem can be replaced by a comparable standard
     subsystem, the relative technical merits of such a substitution, the estimated short-term
     configuration stability of the non-standard subsystem (that is, any operational history),
     and dollar cost of purchasing both the standard and non-standard subsystem. Since the
     PM/IM may have limited or no experience with the capability or stability of the proposed
     non-standard subsystem, information on like or similar standard subsystems may be
     requested.
     8.18.5.3. The PM along with subsystem managers and the system procurement activity
     will prepare a narrative comment stating if the non-standard subsystem is stable enough,
     as to configuration, to require provisioning coding and catalog action, or if the particular
     subsystem is a candidate for Interim Contract Support (ICS) during the period of
     configuration stabilization. The PM/IM will also state if the non-standard subsystem has
     been previously provisioned and cataloged or if it is currently in an ICS mode based on a
     previous FMS program.
     8.18.5.4. ICS for non-standard subsystems should be discussed as a separate issue since
     it is a sole source procurement and usually is not cost effective for conversion to
     permanent sole source logistics support. If ICS is used for a particular non-standard
     subsystem, the LOAD/LOA notes should state that data will not be procured until a
     tentative date for such ICS is set. The FMS customer must be told that ICS must continue
     through the CWTs for data preparation, provisioning, and until delivery of data, spares,
     and SE is completed.
     8.18.5.5. Normally, a separate line item will be part of a system sale LOAD/LOA for
     data provisioning and cataloging. The PM/IM will give a price estimate of the contractor
     data needed for non-standard item provisioning and cataloging. Data items needed are
     those required to provision, screen for I&S, and catalog. Estimating prices means the
     PM/IM must contact the system procurement activity for a best estimate of
     system/subsystem non-standard item applicability. The system procurement activity may
176                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      in turn, have to contact appropriate commercial sources for the needed data. The PM/IM
      will provide a list of the types of data needed to be attached to a consolidated LOAD
      study. Individual pricing of the data types is not necessary.
      8.18.5.6. Configuration status accounting is a choice available to the FMS customer.
      Setting up configuration status accounting anticipates the extended use of an item, with
      the likelihood of changes, updates, modifications, capability enhancements, or deficiency
      corrections. The exact nature of such accounting should be discussed by the AF, the
      FMS customer, and contractor personnel when the baseline configuration is set up.
      Configuration status accounting applications and costs will be on the LOAD and LOA,
      and made an agenda item at the definitization conference. If the specific tasks and FMS
      customer requirements are not known at the time of the LOAD, a best estimate with an
      attached explanation, may be substituted for a firm price.
      8.18.5.7. System sales with non-standard items are difficult to price precisely. The
      nature and volume of the data and services needed cannot be defined until an exact
      configuration is set. The same budgeting difficulties that are faced in research and
      development for standard configurations also apply. The LOAD study and LOA will
      have a statement to that effect, including the assumptions made in arriving at the cost and
      indicate that appropriate line items that include non-standard requirements are likely to be
      adjusted when more realistic prices become firm.
  8.18.6. Normal LOAD processing time for a system sale that includes non-standard items
  and configurations should be as a minimum, four weeks for data accumulation by the
  system/subsystem management functions, and an additional two weeks for data consolidation
  and coordination within the respective MAJCOMs.
  8.18.7. The AFSAC program and line item managers, in coordination with other AFMC
  functional components must make sure there is timely planning for transition from initial
  activation to follow-on support. AF logistics support capabilities, limitations, and intentions
  should be made clear at the start of every system sale. The terms and conditions attached to
  LOAs are the proper method of explaining these actions. Each term and condition,
  particularly those for non-standard item support, should read as a management summary of a
  task or problem, and describe the processes needed to arrive at the objective.
  8.18.8. The FMS customer's decision to get future non-standard support through FMS
  procedures will require:
      8.18.8.1. The PM/IM to identify the non-standard system/subsystem contract data
      requirements including TOs, part number listings, supplementary provisioning technical
      documentation, and configuration accounting information.
      8.18.8.2. Using the derived provisioning data to let the PM/IM categorize items-of-
      supply matched to a non-standard system/subsystem, into one of the following groups:
         8.18.8.2.1. AF-used and managed NSNs, plus those used by AF and managed by
         DLA. Follow-on supply support for this group of identified items can be provided
         under current standard FMS case/line items. NSNs matched to ERRCs “N,” “P,” or
         “T” can be supported through AF managed CLSSA programs as additives or through
         standard support line items on “R” type cases. NSNs shown as ERRC code “S” or
         “U” can be supported on standard “E” type cases.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 177


          8.18.8.2.2. Non-AF used NSNs managed by other DoD services, including GSA.
          The FMS customer must deal directly with the responsible service for such support.
          The FMS customer will be provided a list of these items and encouraged to get
          CLSSA programmed support with the other services.
          8.18.8.2.3. Items not used or managed by any DoD service/agency or GSA (non-
          standard items). Follow-on support for this category of items is described in
          paragraph 8.19.
8.19. Follow-On Non-standard Item Support.
   8.19.1. Non-standard item follow-on support gives FMS customers continuing technical,
   maintenance and supply support once a system/subsystem becomes operational. FMS
   customers receive non-standard item follow-on support from the AF through:
      8.19.1.1. A statement in a system/subsystem sale that says follow-on non-standard item
      support through AF FMS procedures is desired.
      8.19.1.2. A LOR from a FMS customer asking that non-standard item support be
      extended for a current non-standard item follow-on support FMS case/line item.
      8.19.1.3. A LOR from a FMS customer asking that non-standard support be provided
      through FMS channels for a system/subsystem bought from DoD or other US sources
      when such support had not previously been provided.
   8.19.2. Requests for non-standard support should specify the range of support needed for
   each system/subsystem to include NSNs and/or item identification especially for those items
   needing maintenance/repair services. Such data will not commit the FMS customer to
   specific items and quantities, but will give a range guideline for PM/IM functions to use in
   developing LOAD and contract source information.
   8.19.3. The AF will provide non-standard item logistics support only when
   approved/directed by DSCA. When the AF gets requests for follow-on support of non-
   standard systems or end articles not previously approved by DoD, it will assess the impact on
   AF resources and the feasibility for giving this support. The appropriate recommendation
   will then be sent to DSCA. Preparation of LOAD/LOA will start only after getting an
   approved LOR from the AF Center for International Programs (AFCIP), country/PM.
   8.19.4. The best way to get non-standard follow-on support is through B/O cases/line items;
   however, certain commodities and services must have pre-approvals and/or LOAD studies
   that are supported through D/O procedures. The criteria for case support for standard items
   apply to non-standard items. Common non-standard follow-on support case types are: B, C,
   E, G, K, L, M, and P. For a complete list of FMS case types and descriptions, refer to
   AFMAN 16-101, Attachment 3.
   8.19.5. Follow-on non-standard requirements may be part of the same LOA as standard
   requirements as long as they are in the same category of articles or services; however, non-
   standard support must be identified, priced, and controlled on line items separate from those
   of standard support within the same LOA.
   8.19.6. Follow-on non-standard maintenance and supply support will be provided only
   through commercial source contracts initiated by the AFLCMC FMS Program Office. All
   non-standard spares for a particular subsystem will be consolidated for supply and
 178                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   maintenance by a single contractor per end article or subsystem. If possible, such contracts
   will cover all requirements of all FMS customers with the same subsystem. The AFLCMC
   FMS Program Office will initiate follow-on supply support contracts for all non-standard
   spares that cannot be matched to a subsystem. Follow-on support responsibility for each
   non-standard item will be defined as soon as possible after the provisioning and screening
   process.
   8.19.7. There are three types of non-standard items:
       8.19.7.1. Non-standard munitions and munitions related items.
          8.19.7.1.1. Munitions and munitions-related items are classified as FSG 13 or as
          MMAC “MN” (complete round component) or “AQ” (ammunition and explosives).
          Munitions and munitions related items include ammunition, bombs, rockets, etc., as
          well as CAD/PAD. Munitions and munitions related items are non-standard when:
              8.19.7.1.1.1. The item is matched to a stock number classified FSG 13 and has a
              non-standard MMAC “EX,” “PU,” “XA,” “XL,” “XT,” “XU,” “XV,” “XW,”
              “XX,” “XY,” or “XZ.” For a complete list of MMACs, refer to AFMCI 23-105,
              Item Management, when published.
              8.19.7.1.1.2. The item is matched to an inactive (that is, has an assigned
              acquisition advice code (AAC), “Y” (terminal item), and/or an assigned phrase
              code “N” (disposal), “T” (condemned), “V” (discontinued without replacement))
              or non-listed stock number classified in FSG 13 or with an assigned MMAC”
              “AQ” or “MN” regardless of FSG classification.
              8.19.7.1.1.3. The item cannot be matched to a munitions type stock number, but
              should logically be assigned one because of its physical characteristics and usage.
8.19.7.1.2. Non-standard munitions and munitions related items must be requested through FMS
procedures the same as standard munitions. Approvals and acceptance will result in a D/O non-
standard line item on munitions “A” type FMS case, a CAD/PAD “C” type FMS case, or an
initial system/subsystem sale type LOA.

       8.19.7.2. Non-standard SE items of supply.
          8.19.7.2.1. Equipment items are considered non-standard when:
              8.19.7.2.1.1. The item is matched to a NSN with an assigned ERRC code “S” or
              “U” and a non-standard MMAC “EX,” “PU,” “XA,” “XL,” “XT,” “XU,” “XV,”
              “XW,” “XX,” “XY,” or “XZ.”
              8.19.7.2.1.2. The item is matched to a NSN with an assigned ERRC code “S” or
              “U” and an inactive AAC ''Y” and/or phrase code “N,” “T,” or “V.”
              8.19.7.2.1.3. The item is matched only to a manufacturer's part number or other
              non-listed stock number and would logically be classified as an equipment type
              item because of the item's characteristics and usage.
          8.19.7.2.2. Non-standard equipment items are supported through a non-standard line
          item on an FMS case the same as for standard equipment items. Non-standard
          equipment may be supplied through an initial system sale, a D/O “L” type case, or on
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  179


          a B/O “E” case, if an appropriate non-standard line item has been negotiated for such
          support.
      8.19.7.3. Non-standard spares and repair parts. Spares and repair parts have an ERRC of
      “N,” “P,” or “T.”
8.20. Non-standard Item Requisitioning.
   8.20.1. PROS requisitioning. The contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply
   maintenance and task order support. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office
   at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s performance and controls the flow of FMS
   requirements to the contractor.
      8.20.1.1. Input A05 – part number with narrative.
          8.20.1.1.1. General Information.
             8.20.1.1.1.1. A05s are part numbers that do not match to a NSN (see paragraph
             8.20.1.4).
             8.20.1.1.1.2. Part number requirements will not be prepared as “fill/kill.”
             8.20.1.1.1.3. SAMIS passes A05 requisitions directly to the PROS contractor
             based on RIC of the current contract. Review latest PROS Handbook via
             AFSAC On-Line for current RIC.
          8.20.1.1.2. Requisition input other than through SAMIS terminal.
             8.20.1.1.2.1. Enter the manufacturer’s CAGE code as the first five digits of the
             part number for the item – do not input the part number without the CAGE code.
             Reference AFMAN 23-122 and AFMCMAN 23-5 (when published). If the part
             number is input without a CAGE, the first five digits of the part number will be
             stripped off treating that as the CAGE, thus corrupting the part number.
             8.20.1.1.2.2. If the manufacturer’s CAGE is unknown, use the CAGE of the
             current PROS Contractor (contact the PROS PMO or refer to the latest PROS
             Handbook via AFSAC On-Line).
          8.20.1.1.3. Requisition input through a SAMIS terminal.
             8.20.1.1.3.1. QAID of “RQN” in SAMIS.
             8.20.1.1.3.2. Select A05 (part number) option on the screen.
             8.20.1.1.3.3. Use current PROS RIC (contact PROS PMO or refer to PROS
             Handbook via AFSAC On-Line.
             8.20.1.1.3.4. Enter the manufacturer’s CAGE code as the first five digits of the
             part number for the item – do not input the part number without the CAGE code.
             If the part number is input without a CAGE, the first five digits of the part number
             will be stripped off treating it as the CAGE, thus corrupting the part number.
             8.20.1.1.3.5. If known, use the manufacturer’s CAGE code and provide
             manufacturer’s information (i.e., name, phone, address, POC, etc.) in the
             narrative. If the manufacturer’s CAGE is unknown, use the current PROS
             contractor’s CAGE and state this in the narrative.

             8.20.1.1.3.6. Enter “N” for routing media process code.
             8.20.1.1.3.7. A narrative must be entered.
      8.20.1.2. SAMIS edits prior to the requisition passing to PROS.
         8.20.1.2.1. A05 CAGE and part number match to narrative. SAMIS will populate
         the first page of the narrative with CAGE and part number based upon the
         information provided on the input screen -- do not attempt to change this information.
         SAMIS will validate and if the information does not match, it will generate a PRWC
         error to the country team for review/correction.
             8.20.1.2.1.1. SAMIS matches the CAGE to the CAGE on the narrative. If CAGE
             does not match, SAMIS assigns error code “PRWC.” Supply tech will determine
             correct CAGE and release the record. If CAGE does match, then the requisition
             is passed.
             8.20.1.2.1.2. SAMIS matches the part number to the part number on the
             narrative. If part number does not match, SAMIS assigns error code “PRWP.”
             Supply tech will determine correct part number and release the record. If part
             number does match, then the requisition is passed.
             8.20.1.2.1.3. SAMIS checks the country preference table blocks.
                 8.20.1.2.1.3.1. There are four possible blocks on the country preference table.
                  8.20.1.2.1.3.1.1. All requisitions are blocked, NMCS optional.
                  8.20.1.2.1.3.1.2. All A01 requisitions are blocked, NMCS optional.
                  8.20.1.2.1.3.1.3. Low dollar value requisitions are blocked, NMCS optional.
                  8.20.1.2.1.3.1.4. High dollar value requisitions are blocked, NMCS
                  optional.
                 8.20.1.2.1.3.2. If the requisition fails to pass the blocks, error code “PR03” is
                 assigned. CM will request country approval to pass the requisition to PROS.
                 If approved, requisition is passed to PROS for fill action. If denied, the
                 requisition is canceled.
             8.20.1.2.1.4. SAMIS verifies the financial data. If direct cite funds are not
             available error code “PR28” is assigned. Case manager will determine cause for
             lack of direct-cite funds. If funds can be made available, requisition is passed to
             PROS for fill action. If funds cannot be made available, requisition is canceled.
      8.20.1.3. The PROS contractor is required to research all A05 requisitions to ensure
      supportability within the PROS scope. See PROS Handbook via AFSAC On-Line for
      contractor responsibility.
      8.20.1.4. Input A01 – NSN that is not actively managed.
         8.20.1.4.1. Not-actively-managed NSNs are identified by AAC or MMAC.
             8.20.1.4.1.1. For “F__” (i.e., FGZ) SOSs, AAC = “P,” “V,” or “Y.”
             8.20.1.4.1.2. For “S__” (i.e., S9I) SOS, AAC = “F,” “L,” P,” “X” or “Y”
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                              181


            8.20.1.4.1.3. MMAC = EX, PU, XA, XG, XL, XT, XU, XV, XW, XX, XY, XZ.
        8.20.1.4.2. A01 requisitions are sent to SOS as a “fill/kill” requisition.
            8.20.1.4.2.1. If SOS has no residual stock available, SOS will “CB”-pass back to
            SAMIS.
            8.20.1.4.2.2. If no blocker in the system, SAMIS will check for special
            processing requirements and route to PROS.
            8.20.1.4.2.3. If there is a blocker in the system, a CEX (PR03) will generate to
            the CM for review/action.
            8.20.1.4.2.4. If SOS has residual stock, SOS will fill. If SOS can only fill a
            partial QTY, balance is canceled back to the customer. SAMIS will not forward
            the remaining balance to PROS for fill action.
     8.20.1.5. Special processing of actively-managed NSN(s). There are two instances when
     a standard item can be submitted to PROS via an A01 transaction with PMO assistance.
     Both instances require the CCM to coordinate with the SOS prior to providing to the
     PMO for input.
        8.20.1.5.1. If an NSN has multiple part numbers and only one part number will
        support the customer’s requirement, the customer may request PMO input with a
        “2B” advice code, ; or
        8.20.1.5.2. If a requisition is received direct to the PROS contractor with NSN and
        has only one part number with a “2B” advice code, the requisition will be passed to
        the SOS via CY.
     8.20.1.6. A01 – Requisition with actively-managed NSN at SOS (standard item process).
     Requisition sent to SOS for fill action and not yet on contract.
        8.20.1.6.1. Use standard item process to have the requirement “pulled” from the SOS
        and sent to PROS.
        8.20.1.6.2. SOS determines standard item selection criteria.
     8.20.1.7. Internal SAMIS checks for PROS eligibility.
        8.20.1.7.1. SAMIS has internal checks for PROS eligibility (i.e., project code, kind
        of case, advice code, etc.).
        8.20.1.7.2. The following are some SAMIS exclusions to PROS eligibility and
        require PMO action if to be sent to PROS.
            8.20.1.7.2.1. Any advice code that reflects fill/kill (i.e., 2C, 2J, 22). See DLM
            4000.25-1, Appendix 2.15 for a complete list of advice codes.
            8.20.1.7.2.2. Sole source of 6V/BV advice code.
            8.20.1.7.2.3. “ND” NSN not routed to PROS.
            8.20.1.7.2.4. Drawdown or “H” coded requisitions.
            8.20.1.7.2.5. JCL/JCM SOS.
            8.20.1.7.2.6. “O,” “A,” and “C” cases (PMO approval required).
182                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


             8.20.1.7.2.7. MG1 ineligible.
      8.20.1.8. FMS customers may requisition non-standard items if they have an active B/O
      requisition case with a non-standard support line item.
      8.20.1.9. The basic MILSTRIP requisition formats used for standard item requisitions
      are also used for non-standard items. Section 6C describes the standard requisitions data
      fields and entry requirements, which are augmented by the following:
         8.20.1.9.1. Use DIC “A01” requisition format for those non-standard items matched
         to NSNs that also have an assigned MMAC of EX, PU, XA, XG, XL, XN, XV, XW,
         XX, XY, or XZ. These requisitions are submitted by mail, message, or DLA
         Transaction Services. Other types of non-standard NSNs (such as, non-listed or
         inactive) are submitted via DIC “A05” requisition format using a DD Form 1348-6,
         DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document (Manual-Long Form), since
         these types of NSN requirements must have supplemental remarks data for
         identification and support determinations by the SOS.
         8.20.1.9.2. Use DIC “A02” requisition format for those non-standard items identified
         only by a manufacturer's part number in a current AF or country standard technical
         order. The criterion for using the DIC “A02” format is a five-digit CAGE code. The
         part number reference, in combination, cannot exceed the requisition 15-digit stock
         number field, and the appropriate TO, figure, and index reference (including dashes,
         but not the “T” and “O”) will not exceed 14-digits. Part-numbered requirements that
         exceed the DIC “A02” requisition field limits or those without a TO reference, must
         be submitted as DIC “A05” requisitions using the DD Form 1348 format. DIC “A02”
         requisitions are submitted by mail or electronic means.
         8.20.1.9.3. Use DIC “A04” requisition format for those non-standard items matched
         to “NC” stock numbers that also have an assigned MMAC of EX, PU, XA, XG, XL,
         XN, XV, XW, XX, XY, or XZ. DIC “A04” requisitions are submitted by mail, or
         message. DIC A04 should be used for TCTO kits that have a “K” in the fifth position
         of the assigned NSN.
         8.20.1.9.4. Use DIC “A05” requisition format for any non-standard item that does
         not meet the criteria for submission as DIC “A01,” “A02,” or “A04” requisitions.
         DIC “A05” requisitions are for manufacturers' part numbers, “ND” stock numbers,
         inactive NSNs, and non-listed NSNs or other stock numbers. DIC “A05” requisitions
         are manually submitted using the DD Form 1348 data requirements to include
         supplemental remarks and reference materiel needed by a supply source. All
         applicable blocks of the DD Form 1348 will be completed. If the item is not found in
         an AF or country standard TO, a copy of the reference document cover page and
         copies of the applicable page(s) from the reference document that shows the item
         application needs to be submitted as an attachment to the DD Form 1348. The DIC
         “A05” requisition package (DD Form 1348 and any attachments) will be mailed to
         AFSAC, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5000. If quicker processing is needed,
         the DD Form 1348 information may be submitted electronically to include the
         specific blocks and data being identified. In preparing the DD Form 1348, the
         MILSTRIP data requirements in Section 6C will be included in the top part for rp 1-
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   183


        80.   The identification data part of the DD Form 1348 will include as much
        information as is available and be prepared IAW DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 1.06.
     8.20.1.10. All non-standard item requisitions must have an active B/O equipment “E” or
     B/O spares “K” or “R” type case with a non-standard line item. In addition, the
     following apply when processing non-standard requisitions.
        8.20.1.10.1. If a non-standard item is identified as a part number or other non-listed
        stock number requirement and determined to be nonrecurring (that is, a one-time
        requirement with no anticipated future requirements), input demand code “N” in rp
        44 of the requisition. If the item is known or anticipated to be recurring, the annual
        known or anticipated usage will be entered in the requisition's supplemental remarks
        data.
        8.20.1.10.2. Pricing of part number and other non-listed stock number requisitions is
        arbitrarily set at a default price of $35 unit cost since these types of items do not have
        catalog pricing data in the AF systems. This default price is applied to the requisition
        to obligate the applicable FMS case/line item funds until proper identification and
        pricing can be done. Depending on the item, the default price may be an
        understatement or overstatement of actual cost and could cause a temporary large
        imbalance to the case/line item. If an actual or estimated unit price for the part
        number or non-listed item is known, it will be added in the DIC “A05” requisition as
        dollars (rp 73-78) and cents (rp 79-80).
     8.20.1.11. All non-standard requisitions are received and processed at AFSAC for entry
     into the AF supply system. Depending on the FMS customer's way of transmission and
     the requisition type, DIC A01, A02, and A04 non-standard requisitions are processed as
     follows.
        8.20.1.11.1. Requisitions received through telecommunications are input directly to
        SAMIS. Requisitions received by mail or other electronic means (other than DIC
        “A05”) are input by the country team to SAMIS through on-line data entry
        immediately after arriving at AFSAC.
        8.20.1.11.2. SAMIS validates the non-standard requisition, establishes document
        control records, obligates appropriate case/line item funds, and mechanically routes
        the transaction to PROS for supply support determination and action. For A01 and
        A04 requisitions, routing is based on the stock number's assigned MMAC. For A02
        part number requisitions, SAMIS routing is directly to PROS. If the A02 requisition's
        TO reference identity does not match the SAMIS TO/SOS management responsibility
        cross-reference data table, the requisition is mechanically rejected back to the FMS
        customer with requisition transaction status code “CG” (unable to identify requested
        item). The FMS customer must then resubmit a new “A02” requisition with the
        correct data or resubmit as an A05 requisition with the appropriate supplemental data,
        if the non-standard item is still needed.
     8.20.1.12. A05 requisitions for non-standard items are received at AFSAC by mail or
     electronic means. These transactions will be pre-screened by AFSAC country team
     before submitting to SAMIS for routing to PROS. The PROS PMO is not responsible for
     non-standard requisition input. Receipt instructions are as follows:
184                                                 AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      8.20.1.12.1. The A05 requisition's supplementary remarks data is reviewed for
      adequacy of item identification data for the type of non-standard item being
      requested. Requisitions with insufficient or missing data are suspended and until the
      customer provides the missing or additional information needed so processing can
      continue by the PROS contractor. See PROS Handbook located on AFSAC On-Line
      for contractor’s responsibility/response.
      8.20.1.12.2. If a non-standard stock number is matched (such as, NSN or “NC” stock
      number with an assigned MMAC EX, PU, XA, XL, XT, XU, 'XV, 'XW, XX, XY, or
      XZ), the A05 requisition will be changed to an A01 (NSN) or A04 (“NC” stock
      number) requisition for input to SAMIS for continued processing. The FMS
      customer will be informed of the part number/stock number conversion for updating
      of their records.
      8.20.1.12.3. If the part number is matched to an inactive NSN, the part numbered
      requisition's supplemental data will be reviewed to ensure end item/NHA application
      and other justification is present. As necessary, the FMS customer will be asked for
      additional data. Once sufficient data is available, the A05 requisition's supplemental
      data will be updated to show AFSAC screening results and processed in SAMIS.
      8.20.1.12.4. Part numbers unmatched to stock numbers will be processed as follows:
         8.20.1.12.4.1. Part-numbered requisitions referring to AF or country standard TO
         will be screened for TO validity using the SAMIS technical order/SOS
         management responsibility cross-reference table. Results will be processed as
         follows:
             8.20.1.12.4.1.1. Part numbers referenced to a valid TO will be processed for
             SAMIS input and manual routing to the SOS having TO management
             responsibility.
             8.20.1.12.4.1.2. Part-numbered requisitions referenced to a TO not listed on
             the SAMIS table must have a copy of the applicable TO cover page and
             copies of the pages referencing the part number application included as
             attachments to the DD Form 1348. If the required attachments are not
             included, the requisition will be rejected back to the FMS customer for re-
             submittal with the required supplemental data and attachments. Part-
             numbered requisitions with the required data attachments will be processed
             for SAMIS input and manual routing to PROS.
         8.20.1.12.4.2. Part-numbered requisitions referenced to a manufacturer's
         publication or other commercial document must have a copy of the reference
         publications cover page and the applicable page(s) giving the part number
         application included as attachments to the DD 1348. If insufficient information is
         provided by the customer, an “X-2” status code will be input by the PROS
         contractor to signify they are waiting for information from the customer. The
         contractor will send request to the customer identifying the specific data
         requirement. Upon receipt of required data, the contractor will input an “R-2”
         signifying they are resuming work on the requisition.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                              185


        8.20.1.12.5. If the A05 requisition has an inactive NSN or other non-listed stock
        number, appropriate federal supply catalog system records will be screened to verify
        or identify the stock number status. The requisition and the stock number screening
        results will be processed the same as for part-numbered requisitions. The requisition
        supplemental data and any additional attachment requirements must also be the same
        to include end item, NHA, source document references, and justification.
        8.20.1.12.6. Once the A05 requisition identification data has been researched and
        verified and determined to be ready for processing, the appropriate AFSAC case/line
        IM will process the transaction as follows:
           8.20.1.12.6.1. Verify the requisition's MILSTRIP data content for completeness
           (such as, add/correct demand code, SOS RIC, DCN, case/line item designator,
           unit price, etc.) and input to SAMIS.
           8.20.1.12.6.2. Write a cover letter for the A05 non-standard item requisition to
           include the results of any stock number screening that may be of benefit to the
           supply source in their research and support determination. If the DD Form 1348-
           6 does not have attachments and the urgency of the requirement requires it, a
           message may be used to send the DD Form 1348-6 MILSTRIP and supplemental
           data to the appropriate supply source. Any transmittals to the supply source will
           have the following statement: “If NSN assignment is required, cite FMS case
           _______ line item _______ .” The case and line item entry will be an established
           “G” type case/line item of the applicable FMS customer that was established to
           cover cataloging services requirements. If no “G” type case/line item has been
           established, the cataloging services may be charged to the non-standard FMS
           case/line item on which the materiel was ordered.
           8.20.1.12.6.3. After SAMIS acceptance and posting of the A05 requisition
           transaction, the AFSAC case manager will send the DD Form 1348-6 data
           package (or message, as appropriate) to the PROS PMO.
        8.20.1.12.7. The AFSAC case manager will check on the PROS processing of the
        A05 requisition to ensure there is responsive action. When no supply status has been
        received in 14 calendar days for priority designators 0l-08 or 30 calendar days for
        priority designators 09-15, a manual follow-up will be input to SAMIS for
        mechanical processing to the SOS, where the original A05 requisition package was
        sent.
     8.20.1.13. PROS will get A05 requisitions for FMS non-standard items by mail or
     message on DD Form 1348-6 format from AFSAC. The DD Form 1348 requisition will
     be processed as follows:
        8.20.1.13.1. Immediately input the MILSTRIP requisition data to the D035A system
        as prescribed in AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1 (when published). This will establish a
        DCN control record and a CEX suspense.
        8.20.1.13.2. Establish an internal PROS control record of all FMS A05 non-standard
        item requisitions to monitor the off-line research and support determination actions
        until a positive supply status is provided to the FMS customer. This record will be
        updated to show the current SOS having physical possession of the DD Form 1348-6
186                                                 AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      data package for technical review/action. This record will be used to support and
      respond to off-line queries for current non-standard item requisitions that show a
      delay status for technical review.
      8.20.1.13.3. PROS will process the A05 non-standard requisitions, as well as the A02
      part number requisitions received for FMS support. Part-numbered requisitions will
      be processed as explained in AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1 (when published), with the
      following additional guidance:
         8.20.1.13.3.1. If additional data is needed, immediately tell the FMS customer by
         message with an informational copy to the AFSAC case manager outlining the
         information needed. If the required data cannot be provided, or the FMS
         customer does not respond within 14 calendar days to the request reject the
         requisition with supply status code “D3.”
         8.20.1.13.3.2. If the requisition was routed incorrectly or otherwise needs to be
         rerouted to another SOS, pass it using a requisition transaction status code of
         “BM” and a fund code of “4F.” Ensure the total DD Form 1348 and any
         attachments are also routed to the gaining SOS.
         8.20.1.13.3.3. If a part number can be identified to a non-standard NSN or “NC”
         stock number (i.e., a stock number with an assigned MMAC of “EX,” “PU,”
         “XA,” “XL,” “XT,” “XU,” XV,” XW,” “XX,” “XY,” or “XZ”), process the
         requisition using the stock number and provide a “BG” requisition transaction
         status code.
             8.20.1.13.3.3.1. If the part number can be identified to an active standard
             NSN or “NC” stock number, reject the requisition with requisition transaction
             status code “CA” advising of the stock number to requisition if the
             requirement still exists and to use standard FMS case/line item requisitioning
             procedures.
             8.20.1.13.3.3.2. Rejection code “CG” (unable to identify requested item) will
             not be used to reject DIC A05 requisitions from FMS customers. If the
             requested item cannot be identified from the customer supplied additional
             remarks, the requisition will be queried for the needed additional data or the
             requisition may be rejected with requisition transaction status code “CA” with
             an explanation of why the required item cannot be supported.
             8.20.1.13.3.3.3. If an FMS requisition results in a decision to catalog the item
             as non-standard, such cataloging action will be initiated IAW AFMCMAN
             23-5, Volume 1 (when published). A unique non-standard MMAC “X_” for
             the appropriate SOS will be assigned to the NSN of all FMS non-stocked
             items which are cataloged. Costs for catalog services will be charged to the
             FMS case/ line item cited on the A05 requisition for DIC A02 requisitions and
             those A05 requisitions not having a cited catalog services funds solely for
             appropriate AFSAC case managers will be requested to provide an FMS
             case/line item to cover costs. When any cataloging action is begun, the
             appropriate AFSAC case manager will be told so appropriate funds can be
             obligated and the customer told that cataloging action for non-standard items
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                 187


                is required when:
                8.20.1.13.3.3.4. The requisition's demand code indicates a recurring
                requirement (“R” or blank) and the appropriate ES agrees that cataloging
                action is necessary.
                8.20.1.13.3.3.5. The appropriate ES recommends requisition demand code.
                8.20.1.13.3.3.6. Three or more requisitions indicating a nonrecurring
                requirement (demand code “N”) are received within 180 days. In this
                instance, catalog service charges will be assessed to the last FMS customer
                submitting a requisition within the counting period.
            8.20.1.13.3.4. When a decision is made to catalog a non-standard item, the
            specific requisition that caused the decision will not be cancelled for any reason.
            In addition, when a FMS requirement is determined to also have application to AF
            and the cataloging action will result in the item being coded as AF standard, such
            cataloging charge will not be made against a FMS case/line item but will be
            absorbed by AF.
  8.20.2. Non-standard Item Maintenance/Repair Support.
     8.20.2.1. Maintenance Process.
        8.20.2.1.1. Any item that cannot be repaired at a USG facility is a potential candidate
        for repair by PROS. This includes items with an ERRC of “N” or “P” indicating it is
        a consumable item. Since the SOS does not repair consumable items and some of our
        customers request them to be repaired, these requirements can be accomplished
        through PROS.
        8.20.2.1.2. All maintenance efforts under PROS are repair/replace. The customer
        will get back the same reparable that was submitted for repair action. Every reparable
        will have its own DCN since the reparable is tracked by serial number. If an item is
        determined to be beyond economical repair, the customer will be provided an option
        to continue with repair. If the item is beyond physical repair, the requirement will be
        cancelled. See PROS Handbook via AFSAC On-Line for all contract processes.
        8.20.2.1.3. The cases used for repair under PROS are the same that would be used for
        any other FMS repair requirement. This means a repair requirement for PROS would
        be processed against an “M,””K” or “N” case or a repair line on a “Q” or “S” case. If
        the customer does not have an appropriate repair case, the case/CM must work with
        AFLCMC/WFN to obtain a waiver for using another case. The PMO is unable to
        provide this waiver.
     8.20.2.2. Classified.
        8.20.2.2.1. Country classified items can be ordered/repaired through PROS; however,
        it is the customer’s responsibility to advise of country classification. This is because
        the DoD system does not reflect the country’s classification of their items. Only
        through the customer’s notification can the AF afford the same level of protection to
        the assets that the customer would provide.
 188                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


          8.20.2.2.2. Classified items cannot be supported through PROS without PMO
          approval. It is the responsibility of the case/CM to provide the PMO with a copy of
          the transportation plan, if required for shipment of classified reparables.
8.21. Worldwide Warehouse Redistribution Services (WWRS).
   8.21.1. General. WWRS is a virtual materiel warehouse that lists excess serviceable
   materiel, non-SME, and reparable component parts on the WWRS web page by NSN, MMC,
   noun, part number, CAGE code, ERRC, shelf-life, annual demand, SCC, QTY and price.
   Interested purchasers may browse the WWRS web page to determine availability by pressing
   the Item Search radio button or by downloading the entire inventory.
   8.21.2. Scope. WWRS operates under the AECA, 22 U.S.C 2761, Section 21, which
   provides for the sale of defense services and Section 21 subsection (m) which allows for the
   return of non-SME categorized defense articles. As defined, WWRS transfers do not
   constitute a third-party transfer, using the transfer process outlined in Section 21 (m) consist
   of two separate two-party transfers. The first two-party transfer is between the seller and the
   USG, and the second two-party transfer is between the USG and the purchaser. Additional
   information regarding WWRS redistribution services is outlined in the WWRS Customer
   Handbook and the WWRS notes attached to the LOA for WWRS and can be found on the
   front page of the WWRS website.
   8.21.3. WWRS goals are to:
       8.21.3.1. Reduce FMS customers' excess inventories.
       8.21.3.2. Provide access to materiel at reduced cost.
       8.21.3.3. Reduce CWTs through redistribution of on-the-shelf assets instead of new
       procurement.
       8.21.3.4. Enable materiel sellers to purchase needed FMS assets with the proceeds.
   8.21.4. The assets listed on WWRS are categorized by type and condition.
       8.21.4.1. Category 1 assets are non-SME as defined in section 47(9) of the AECA, spares
       and SE items in fully functioning condition without need of repair or rehabilitation.
       These assets are identified by NSN or by part number and CAGE code, QTY, and price.
       They may be transferred immediately upon receipt of a fully funded requisition.
       Category 1 assets are listed in the WWRS with a blank or “N” in the SME column and a
       blank or “A” in the SCC rp. Where defense articles are in need of repair or rehabilitation,
       the PMO/CCM can assist the provider in facilitating arrangements for repair or
       rehabilitation under FMS.
       8.21.4.2. The guidance in AFMAN 16-101 for FMS applies to these procedures.
       8.21.4.3. All services will be performed without cost to the USG.
       8.21.4.4. All customers who qualify for FMS are eligible to participate in the WWRS
       program.
   8.21.5. Three Methods of Requisitioning WWRS Materiel:
       8.21.5.1. Submission of a nonrecurring requisition with a RIC of “FWW” (indicating
       WWRS as the desired SOS) to SAMIS against the appropriate B/O FMS requisition case.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                     189


         8.21.5.1.1. The ERRC is provided on the WWRS web page next to the NSN to assist
         in determining the appropriate requisition case.
         8.21.5.1.2. Requisitions that contain a NMCS indicator (are not accepted at this time)
         or advice codes “BV,” “6P,” “6V,” or “6W” (which indicate a specific materiel
         source) are rejected with a “F6” rejection code.
     8.21.5.2. Submission of requisitions with a RIC of “FNH” to SAMIS is automatically
     eligible for fill action by the WWRS when the following conditions are met.
         8.21.5.2.1. The CLSSA termination and liability file does not contain the requested
         NSN.
         8.21.5.2.2. When the FMS retention program QTY for the requested NSN is equal to
         zero or stock of serviceable assets does not exist at the SOS.
         8.21.5.2.3. When the requisition value is greater than or equal to $2,500.
         8.21.5.2.4. When the demand code is other than recurring.
         8.21.5.2.5. When the requisition does not contain the advice codes of “BV,” “6P,”
         “6V,” or “6W.”
     8.21.5.3. USG (non-FMS requisitioner) submissions of either a Project Order (PO) for
     internal AF, or a MIPR identifying the materiel required and shipping instructions for the
     materiel. The PO or MIPR will include sufficient funds to ship the requested materiel
     from the In-transit Inspection Point (IIP) to the designated destination.
     8.21.5.4. Requisition priority. All requisitions are filled in the order of receipt. WWRS
     requisitions with RIC “FWW” are treated as “fill or kill” requisitions. If the desired
     WWRS materiel is depleted, the requisition is canceled. All other requisitions received
     with RIC “FNH” will be passed on to another DoD SOS if WWRS cannot fill or partially
     fill the order. MILSTRIP status and bill lines are provided to SAMIS.
     8.21.5.5. Materiel pricing. Purchasers pay the seller's listed materiel price and the actual
     transportation charge to the first destination FF from the IIP. If shipment by collect
     commercial bill of lading is not authorized in the MAPAD, the transportation cost is
     shown as an additional bill line on the requisition. If the delivery term code justifies
     movement within the DTS, a USG bill of lading is issued and the appropriate charge
     assessed below the line on the applicable FMS case.
         8.21.5.5.1. Materiel Selection Process. The seller with the lowest priced NSN listed
         is selected to fill the requisition. When an insufficient QTY of the lowest priced NSN
         to fill the requisition exists, the next higher priced materiel is selected. This selection
         process is repeated until the requisition is filled or all WWRS inventory is depleted.
         Any unfilled portion of a requisition is canceled.
  8.21.6. Materiel Inspection. WWRS materiel will be visually inspected, sanitized, and
  repackaged at a USG contracted IIP prior to its transfer to the purchaser. The USG takes title
  to the materiel prior to transfer, thereby, maintaining anonymity of the FMS parties.
     8.21.6.1. All materiel shipments that pass inspection are subject to normal SDR criteria.
190                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      8.21.6.2. Materiel that fails visual inspection, is returned to the selling country at the
      seller's expense. The seller has first option to replace the defective materiel with
      serviceable materiel prior to the selection of an alternate seller.
  8.21.7. Becoming a Materiel Seller. FMS customers who want to become materiel sellers
  will submit an LOR to identify the dollar amount of services required. The seller's WWRS
  Q-case is written for 8.5 percent of the estimated value of the materiel for sale based on an
  estimated 5-year period of performance with the terms of sale being “Cash with Acceptance.
  Balance as Billed,” unless otherwise advised. The initial deposit will normally equal one-
  twentieth (5%) of the LOA administrative surcharge (1.25% or 1.9% depending on when the
  case was written) for a total amount of 6.25% or 6.9% of the total LOA value. Subsequent
  quarterly billings will be based on actual redistribution charges that occur during the
  respective quarter. The funds required to pay the redistribution fees will be taken from the
  proceeds earned after their deposit into the seller's trust fund. The remaining funds may be
  transferred to an alternate FMS case or left in the WWRS cash holding account at DFAS
  Indianapolis.
      8.21.7.1. A line for WWRS services will be added to an existing case or as part of a new
      case. When added, the special terms of sale are changed to collect 50 percent of the
      administrative surcharge in the first payment and the remaining balance as billed amount
      in the last scheduled payment.
      8.21.7.2. Sellers who are eligible for DTS may request a transportation line be added to
      their WWRS case.
      8.21.7.3. Redistribution will cease when the value of the WWRS line is reached. Case
      managers will notify selling country POC when line values have been committed or
      expended by 75 percent.
      8.21.7.4. When the WWRS LOA is implemented, AFSAC loads the seller data set
      information on the WWRS web page and codes the NSN in SAMIS as WWRS eligible.
      When sellers wish to add NSNs to the list, change quantities or prices, a new data set or
      online updates may be performed. The new data will replace all of the existing data for
      the respective NSN. As materiel is sold, the PMO will decrease the quantities as
      redistribution occurs.
      8.21.7.5. The format for listing excess serviceable materiel is: NSN (rp 1-13), MMAC
      (rp 14-15), action code of 1(rp 16), blanks (rp 17-50), country and activity code (rp 51-
      52), space (rp 53), country record identification code (rp 54-56), spaces (rp 57-58), QTY
      (rp 59-63, e.g. 00001), spaces (rp 64-65), and the desired unit price (rp 66-74 in US
      dollars and cents). Additional optional data fields are ERRC (rp 76), shelf-life code (rp
      77), RIC (rp 78-80), item name (rp 81-99), SCC (rp 100), SME indicator (rp 101),
      HAZMAT code (rp 102), classified code (rp 103), CAGE (rp 104-108), and part number
      (rp 109-140). The country record identification code is a unique ID assigned by the seller
      to indicate materiel storage point, weapon system, in-country location, or account. The
      seller normally assigns these three positions.
      8.21.7.6. As part of the LOA, sellers are required to have internet access to view and
      update the WWRS web pages. Internet access includes an E-mail capability for efficient
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                191


     and effective communications with the WWRS PMO. Internet/web access fees are the
     seller's responsibility.
     8.21.7.7. The seller’s WWRS LOA/case is charged an 8.5 percent redistribution fee, or a
     minimum of $200 per RDO for all materiel received at the IIP regardless of whether or
     not the materiel passes inspection. The redistribution fee is billed when the materiel is
     shipped to the purchaser or back to the seller.
     8.21.7.8. LOA quarterly payments. Sufficient funds are transferred automatically from
     the materiel proceeds and deposited in the seller’s WWRS “Q” case to cover the actual
     WWRS fees incurred. When sufficient funds are not available due to the shipment of
     defective materiel, DFAS Indianapolis will send a payment notice with the Quarterly 645
     Billing Statement.
  8.21.8. Seller Order Processing. Upon AFSAC's receipt of a requisition for WWRS listed
  materiel, the selected seller is sent a RDO. The RDO will state the desired NSN, QTY, and
  extended dollar value. The seller must respond to the RDO within five business days
  regarding their ability to provide the materiel. Failure to respond in the allotted time will
  result in cancellation of the RDO.
     8.21.8.1. Upon receipt of an acceptable response and funds commitment, the PM will
     send a RDO to the seller providing the purchaser has not canceled its requisition and
     sufficient funds are available to purchase the materiel.
     8.21.8.2. The RDO is the authority for the seller to ship the materiel to the IIP.
         8.21.8.2.1. Packaging/Transportation. The customer is responsible for all packaging
         and transportation costs for the return of all materiel to the WWRS IIP. Shipments of
         returns will be accomplished through the customer's FF and shipped to the designated
         IIP on a paid commercial bill of lading, except when the AF must use the DTS for
         classified/hazardous/sensitive materiel or as required.
         8.21.8.2.2. FMS items returned to the CONUS are entitled to duty free entry to the
         US. Free entry into the US is authorized IAW the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 USC,
         Section 1202, Harmonized Tariff Schedule. These items will usually be consigned to
         the customer's FF. The FF will be responsible for clearing the shipment through US
         customs. A customs declaration format must be included with each shipment, and
         must be included with the shipping document. WWRS customs declaration format is:
         Shipment is entitled to entry under 9801.00.10, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the
         United Stated (HTSUS) free duty. USAF WWRS-FMS EXCESS MATERIEL

         8.21.8.2.3. Receipt at the IIP begins the inspection and financial funds transfer
         process.
  8.21.9. Funds transfers.
     8.21.9.1. Funds received from the purchaser for WWRS materiel are transferred through
     the WWRS clearing account to the respective sellers' Q-6QX trust funds at DFAS
 192                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       Indianapolis;   thus, masking the identity of the materiel seller from the materiel
       purchaser.
       8.21.9.2. Funds from the sellers’ Q-6QX account are transferred to their respective
       WWRS case to cover the WWRS fees assessed during the month to include any
       applicable administrative surcharge. The funds remaining in the Q-6QX account after the
       funds have been transferred can be used to cover other FMS requirements or removed as
       cash.
       8.21.9.3. Funds to reimburse the transportation costs are paid directly to the IIP as
       prepaid freight.

Section 8E—MATERIEL RETURN SUPPORT FOR FMS

8.22. Purpose.
   8.22.1. This section provides procedures for handling and processing materiel returns for
   FMS.
   8.22.2. Requests for the sale of maintenance services for the modification and rehabilitation
   of aircraft, propulsion engines, major electronic components, and special purpose vehicles
   must be submitted according to the guidance in AFMAN 16-101.
8.23. Overview.
   8.23.1. AFMAN 16-101 guidance applies to these FMS procedures.
   8.23.2. All services will be done without cost to the USG. The FMS customer will pay all
   transportation charges, broker fees, port handling charges, etc. Reimbursement from any
   USG funds is not authorized.
   8.23.3. Requests for authority to return items which are the responsibility of the Army,
   Navy, or Marine Corps will not be submitted through AF FMS channels unless specifically
   authorized by HQ USAF. Only those items where a Depot Maintenance Interservice Support
   Agreement (DMISA) can be negotiated will be eligible for consideration of a waiver
   (reference AFLCR 400-21, Wholesale Inventory Management and Logistics Support of
   Multi-Service–Used Non-Consumable Items.
   8.23.4. Requests for TCTO modification kits or negotiation of a modification workload will
   be submitted according to the procedural guidance in AFMAN 16-101 and DoDI 5000.02.
   TCTO/modification requirements are not an acceptable workload unless specifically
   requested according to the referenced publications.
       8.23.4.1. The P&A provided by the AFLCMC Weapon System Manager to the case
       manager will clearly state if a modification kit is needed.
       8.23.4.2. Modification kits will be billed to the “M” case used for repair. Those items
       requiring modification will be repaired on a repair and return “M” case unless the
       applicable AFLCMC Weapon System Manager can ensure all charges for the
       modification will be billed to a D/O repair/replace “M” case.
       8.23.4.3. If the customer already has a requisition in the system for the modification kit,
       change the requisition to send the kit to the applicable Source of Repair (SOR) to be used
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    193


      in repair. The case manager will tell the customer of the change. When sending the asset
      in for repair, the customer will send a modification kit, when available. The advanced
      shipping instructions will identify if a modification kit has been included.
   8.23.5. Customers cannot cancel “H” coded requisitions generated by the AF upon receipt of
   a reparable item. However, the IMS is authorized to cancel “H” coded requisitions. The 430
   SCMS will process cancellations for all “H” coded requisitions and provide the AFSAC case
   manager with reason for cancellation and provide customer options for alternative methods
   of support.
   8.23.6. All customers who qualify for FMS are eligible for unserviceable return services.
   8.23.7. Emergency repair or services of grounded foreign aircraft is not an FMS transaction.
   Procedures for repair are in AFMAN 23-122.
8.24. General.
   8.24.1. When authorized, the AF section of the SCO will advise and help eligible customers
   on FMS matters.
   8.24.2. FMS customers will complete an initial inspection of the unserviceable (reparable)
   returns, excluding the shipment of items which cannot economically be repaired. Returns
   will be packed in the specified Special Packaging Instruction (SPI) container to prevent
   additional damage.
   8.24.3. All containers will be inspected prior to shipment to ensure the case identifier and
   DCN are clearly marked on both the DD Form 1348-1A by NSN and by QTY, and the DD
   Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Reparable) Tag - Materiel, or AFTO Form 350, Reparable
   Item Tag. Packing and marking instructions are in AFMAN 16-101 and MIL-STD-129P.
   8.24.4. The responsible depot receiving organization will inspect every FMS return shipment
   to verify that the contents and the container(s) match the DD Form 1348-1A and the required
   SPI container. All items will be visually inspected first to make sure they can be repaired
   economically. FSCs 8140/8145 containers required by the SPI and not with the item will be
   reported as a shortage. The depot’s receiving organization will sign one copy of the DD
   Form 1348-1 and send it to the customer to show proof of receipt and to maintain accurate
   accountability during the repair cycle.
   8.24.5. Shipments of unserviceable returns will be processed through the customer's FF and
   shipped to the designated repair activity on a paid CBL, except when the AF must use the
   DTS for classified, hazardous, and sensitive materiel. Specific instructions for the use of
   DTS will be in each LOA.
   8.24.6. The FMS items returned to the CONUS are entitled to duty free entry to the US.
   Free entry into the US is IAW Item 800 of the Tariff Schedules of the US (19 USC 1202).
   These items will usually be consigned to the customer's FF. The FF will be responsible for
   clearing the shipment through US customs. A customs declaration form must be included
   with each reparable shipment, and must be included with the shipping document. A customs
   declaration format is in Attachment 10, Table 10A.2. The FF will send the shipment
   (transportation charges prepaid) to the repair activity.
   8.24.7. If items are returned for repair using repair/replace procedures and cannot be taken in
   immediately by maintenance, these items will be kept separate from AF assets while waiting
 194                                                     AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   for repair. If items are returned for repair before the schedule provided by the SOS, a storage
   charge may apply. Storage charges may also apply while waiting for a reply to the initial
   follow-up to the Notice of Availability (NOA). The SOS will provide all necessary
   information to the AFLCMC/WFC for delivery reporting storage charges. A rate of 1.5
   percent annually or .125 percent monthly of the average monthly value of customer-owned
   materiel will be charged to applicable FMS cases to recover an activity's costs of storage.
   8.24.8. Maintenance descriptions and data requirements related to FMS. Maintenance
   production occurs both in the operating commands and in AFMC. The assignment of repair
   tasks to each is usually determined by the degree of skill specialization, the complexity of SE
   or repair processes, and the need for specialized facilities. The review requirements/criteria
   spelled out in AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program,
   must be met in all instances before any level of maintenance capability is offered under FMS.
   8.24.9. If an item is condemned, the materiel will be separated for 30 days when disposition
   instructions have not been included on the DD Form 1348-1A. If after 30 days there is no
   response from the country, the 430 SCMS will ship the condemned item to DLA Distribution
   Services. The data elements in paragraph A10.1.9. will be included on the Disposal Turn In
   Document (DTID) to identify the item as a FMS-owned asset. The supply inspector will
   certify the condemned condition by putting his/her stamp in the remarks block of the DTID.
   The 430 SCMS will provide the receipt and any condemnation information to the AFSAC
   case manager. The AFSAC case manager will provide receipt status to the FMS customer.
       8.24.9.1. The depot’s warehouse office will inform the 430 SCMS who will, in turn, tell
       the case manager that the item has been condemned. If the item is on a D/O case and has
       been condemned, the AFSAC case manager will ask the FMS customer if a replacement
       reparable is available to replace the condemned item. If not, the case manager will
       modify the case to delete the item. 430 SCMS will include the data elements on the
       DTID to identify the item as an FMS-owned asset and clear the unmatched D6 receipt.
       8.24.9.2. If the item is on a B/O case, the depot warehouse office will:
          8.24.9.2.1. Notify the 430 SCMS of the reparable receipt; who in turn will inform the
          FMS customer, through the AFSAC case manager.
          8.24.9.2.2. Ship the condemned item to DLA Distribution Services. The data
          elements in paragraph A10.1.9 will be included on the DTID to show the item is an
          FMS-owned asset. The supply inspector will certify the condemned condition by
          putting his/her stamp in the remarks block.
8.25. Overall Concept.
   8.25.1. When a customer must have a serviceable replacement, the following methods will
   be used for CLSSA procedures, D/O, and B/O maintenance cases.
       8.25.1.1. CLSSA Procedures. CLSSA customers will use the procedures in Attachment
       11 for replacement of AF-managed investment items. Materiel Repair Requirements List
       (MRRL) non-acceptance codes are in Attachment 12. Note: A CLSSA customer must
       set up one or more maintenance cases (“M”) to provide for repair and return of
       equipment items, engines, engine modules, and non-standard subsystems. These
       procedures are in Attachment 13.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                195


     8.25.1.2. D/O maintenance (“M”) cases may set up by all FMS customers. These cases
     allow for two types of repair services; repair/replace and repair/return. The customer
     defines specified items/ quantities to be included on the case. Separate cases must be set
     up for each type of repair. Detailed instructions are in Attachment 14.
     8.25.1.3. B/O maintenance (“M”) cases may be set up by all FMS customers. In this type
     of case, the customer states the dollar value available for maintenance support during a
     one-year period. Detailed instructions are in Attachment 13.
  8.25.2. The IM/ES determines which type of repair support the item will have with regard to
  FMS (serialized control is not always viable).
  8.25.3. The type of repair is normally determined by the ERRC of the item(s) being repaired.
  The following criteria apply:
     8.25.3.1. ERRCs “N” and “P” (consumable items) are not usually eligible for repair
     under FMS procedures.
     8.25.3.2. ERRCs “S” and “U” (equipment items) are repaired on repair/return cases.
     8.25.3.3. ERRC “T” (investment items) is usually repaired on repair/replace cases. These
     items may be repaired on repair/return cases when items are not approved for
     repair/replace or when the country can justify this method, and the AFLCMC FMS
     Program Office can ensure the repair can be completed using repair/return procedures.
  8.25.4. Precision Measurement Equipment (PME) calibration and repair services.
     8.25.4.1. For D/O cases, AFSAC will:
         8.25.4.1.1. Receive the P&A request from the FMS customer or the SCO. P&A
         requests are sent to AFMETCAL/MLSS.
         8.25.4.1.2. Obtain P&A data from AFMETCAL/MLSS. AFSAC will compute
         accessorial costs, prepare an LOA, and send it to the FMS customer for approval and
         signature
         8.25.4.1.3. After getting an approved LOA, AFSAC will get financial OA and
         prepare an IPD for AFMETCAL/MLSS stating the actions needed.
     8.25.4.2. For B/O cases, AFSAC will:
         8.25.4.2.1. Prepare the LOA for approval by the FMS customer. After receiving a
         signed LOA for B/O PMEL calibration services, AFSAC will get financial OA and
         prepare an IPD for AFMETCAL/MLSS stating the actions needed to support the
         case.
     8.25.4.3. The AFMETCAL/MLS, Metrology Directorate, will:
         8.25.4.3.1. Receive metrology planning and review/P&A requests from AFSAC.
         8.25.4.3.2. Conduct functional and economic analyses to determine the most efficient
         method of providing metrology support to SA customers.
         8.25.4.3.3. Coordinate PMEL measurement standards and equipment planning and
         review cost data with the SOS, if applicable.
         8.25.4.3.4. Send the metrology support plan data to AFSAC.
 196                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


          8.25.4.3.5. Participate in site surveys to develop PMEL program/facilities
          requirements.
          8.25.4.3.6. Recommend PMEL training program, On-the-Job Training (OJT)
          requirements to AFSAT.
          8.25.4.3.7. Get the IPD from AFSAC.
          8.25.4.3.8. Take part in definitization conferences and program review when
          metrology programs are involved.
          8.25.4.3.9. Prepare a list of 33K/33L series technical publications for the FMS
          customer’s initial lay-in publication.
          8.25.4.3.10. Provide instructions for shipping, reviewing, marking, handling,
          packaging, payment, and reporting to AFSAC on disposition of equipment and
          reimbursement for metrology calibration services provided by AF laboratories to SA
          customers.
          8.25.4.3.11. Participate in meetings and reviews when asked by AFSAC.
          8.25.4.3.12. Provide calibration costs through to DFAS-CO/JAK.
8.26. Non-standard Repair.
   8.26.1. Items with an inactive NSN, no NSN, or NSNs with MMACs EX, PU, XL, XT, XV,
   XW, or XZ cannot be repaired on the CLSSA FMSO II “K” case. They are normally
   repaired contractually on a defined or B/O repair/return case. If the only source of repair is
   the AF organic facility, repair may be done organically. All repair bits and pieces not
   maintained in AF stock will be provided on the repair case and maintained separately at the
   repair facility.
   8.26.2. When a non-standard item is repaired contractually and the AF Plant Representative
   Office (AFPRO) has no TO to verify that the repair was completed before signing a DD
   Form 250, a country standard TO or commercial TO may be used.
   8.26.3. Additional guidance on non-standard support is in Section 8D.
8.27. Exceptions.
   8.27.1. Classified/hazardous/dangerous or explosive items are usually repaired on a D/O
   repair/return case. This information will be clearly stated in the P&A study.
   8.27.2. Any exceptions to the preceding guidance must have AFLCMC/WFN approval along
   with the source of repair before issuing the LOA.

Section 8F—SECTION 30 AECA SALES TO US COMPANIES

8.28. General. Section 30, AECA, allows for the sale of GFE/GFM and related defense
services to US companies in connection with proposed direct commercial exports pursuant to the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Additional guidance can be located in
AFMAN 16-101 and DSCA Manual 5105.38-M.
8.29. Authorized Items. Items cannot be sold to US companies in support of direct commercial
sales if items can be obtained from US commercial sources in sufficient CWT to meet
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  197


contractual delivery schedules. Sales of items from stock will not normally be authorized if the
stock level would drop below the reorder point. Assigned country F/ADs will be used to
determine relative priority of requirements. The Director, DSCA will resolve any questions of
priority between two or more competing foreign requirements. Sales may be authorized for:
   8.29.1. Articles of a type approved for FMS that would be supplied as GFE or GFM for a
   DoD procurement of an end item and would expedite the direct commercial sale involved.
   8.29.2. Services such as transportation, installation, testing, or certification that would be
   directly related to the direct commercial sale. Such services can only be performed in the US
   in support of the sale of defense articles. Services alone cannot be provided.
8.30. Authorized Purchasers. Sales may be authorized to a company incorporated in the US
when either the company is:
   8.30.1. An existing end item prime contractor with an approved export license and final
   assembly or manufacture will take place in the US, or a known manufacturer, assembler, or
   developer of ammunition components and either a US subcontractor to an authorized
   purchaser or;
   8.30.2. A US contractor or US subcontractor to a foreign company that is supplying items to
   a friendly foreign government.
8.31. Processing US Company LORs. US companies desiring Section 30 support submit
LORs to SAF/IA. If requests are approved, LOA data is processed through the same channels
as normally accomplished for FMS. LOA data must include full recoupment of all DoD support
costs to include the various surcharges that would apply to FMS. Section 30 sales agreements
are prepared and processed in the same manner as FMS cases. AFMAN 16-101 provides an
example of a Section 30 Sales Agreement format.
8.32. Processing Requirements. To implement approved Section 30 Sales Agreements, IPDs
will be issued first from SAF/IA then by AFSAC outlining basic authorities, responsibilities, and
processing requirements. The US company will be assigned a DoDAAC and will use
MILSTRIP requisitioning procedures in submitting requirements.

Section 8G—Global Weapon System Support (GWSS)

8.33. Core Principles. GWSS provides a mutually beneficial business model for global support
and integrated sustainment of a weapon system. GWSS is comprised of a weapon system fleet
of nations who agree to partner with the USAF and other nations to support their weapon system
in a collaborative manner, under a single but flexible business model. Some of the core GWSS
principles are:
   8.33.1. Collective Spares Pool. International partners contribute to a collective pool of
   weapon system peculiar spares. The pool includes spares replenishment, repair and replace
   of assets and other services and is owned and managed by the USAF. The funding for the
   spares pool is pro-rated based on common fleet factors such as partner’s fleet size, flying
   rate, engine cycles and location.
   8.33.2. Common, System Peculiar, Special Mission Assets, and Equipment. GWSS partners
   evaluate their mission requirements and procure, maintain, and sustain common, system
   peculiar, and special mission equipment at their operating location. Initial recommendations
 198                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   for sustainment are based upon partner’s operational requirements identified in the LOR.
   Adjustments are made when actual operational data is known.
   8.33.3. Integration with USAF Processes and Systems. International partners can optimize
   benefits by integrating national support teams with USAF and where applicable, leverage off
   existing USAF systems and processes.
   8.33.4. Cost Sharing. International partners share costs associated with the ongoing
   provision of weapon system peculiar spares and core support services. The funding
   contribution is pro-rated. Costs associated with common spares and any specific country-
   unique requirements are not shared. Certain unique requirements can be shared when
   multiple partners have the same requirement.
   8.33.5. Information Sharing. International partners with DoS-approved Third Party Transfer
   (TPT) agreements may share fleet programmatic, technical and operational information with
   other partners and participate in USAF-led, multiple nation management meetings and
   forums. Extent of program implementation is dependent on extent partners provide flying
   hours, failure rates, and usage data.
8.34. GWSS-Unique Attributes. GWSS allows international partners to share with the USG
and each other the resources necessary to provide sustainment support for weapon systems that
were acquired through standard FMS and or Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) processes. There
are several key differences between support provided through a GWSS versus using standard
FMS or DCS sustainment support:
   8.34.1. Title Transfer. The GWSS weapon system peculiar “spares pool” are USG-titled
   assets. Consequently, title transfer from the USG to the international partner occurs when the
   asset is issued from the Main Operating Base (MOB) supply activity to the maintenance
   activity for installation on the weapon system. Conversely, title transfer from the
   international partner to the USG occurs when assets are turned in from the maintenance
   organizations to the MOB supply activity. Each international MOB supply activity is
   assigned a Stock Record Account Number IAW AFI 24-230, Maintaining Air Force DoD
   Activity Address Codes (DODAAC). Title transfer for common supply assets and equipment
   is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LOA.
   8.34.2. GWSS Transportation. GWSS system peculiar assets shipments to and from an
   international partner are USG-titled and will be transported in accordance with the DTR
   4500.9-R. The shipment modes are the Defense Transportation Service or the designated
   shipper. Common assets will be shipped as designated in the partners LOA.
   8.34.3. Duties and Taxes. US laws permit duty and tax free export from and import into the
   US of USG-titled assets. International agreements will include provisions for GWSS system
   peculiar, USG-titled assets to move “Duty Free” through partner’s customs. When an
   international agreement is not in place with the partner’s country to permit free import and
   export of USG-titled assets, the duties and taxes are the partner’s responsibility. GWSS
   system-peculiar spares shipping labels will include plain language text identifying GWSS
   assets as property of the USG in support of the USAF world-wide “Weapon System Name”
   (e.g., C-17) requirement. The LOA and Form DSP-94, Authority to Export Defense Articles
   Sold Under the Foreign Military Sales Program, is the export and import license for
   common assets.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   199


8.35. GWSS Membership. International partners purchasing USAF weapon systems where
GWSS is provided join the GWSS through the implementation of a LOA with the USG.
Membership does not impose obligations, but it does have expectations as to how each partner is
to operate and sustain their weapon system fleet. The acceptance of the LOA and GWSS model
allows for participants of GWSS to optimize the benefits. Key facets of GWSS membership are:
   8.35.1. Level of Engagement and Conformity. International partners may choose to limit
   their engagement with other GWSS partners, but would forego the associated benefits.
   International partners may also choose to limit their level of conformity concerning core
   GWSS model principles and in so doing forego the full GWSS benefits and become liable for
   additional country-unique support costs.
   8.35.2. Benefits. The GWSS model ensures small weapon system fleets remain affordable
   and through standardization, provides unparalleled opportunities for interoperability. The
   level of benefit derived, depends on the level of integration sought by each potential partner,
   the level of commitment to the core principles of the GWSS model and the partner’s
   commitment to enter into relevant international agreements.
       8.35.2.1. Enhanced Affordability. Continued affordability is generated through sharing
       fixed support costs and obtaining economies of scale for the procurement of goods and
       services.
       8.35.2.2. Improved Support. The consolidation of a collective spares pool and the joint
       use of support infrastructure provide efficient use of component and aircraft depots,
       improves timeliness of support, reduces sustainment risks and provides a global network
       of support bases.
       8.35.2.3. Improved Interoperability. The common aircraft configuration and common
       operational regimen promotes understanding, facilitates joint operational planning,
       facilitates simulator training and optimizes airlift capabilities.
   8.35.3. GWSS Membership Costs. There is no cost directly related to GWSS membership,
   but there are initial costs that are intrinsically linked to a commitment to the GWSS model.
   Notably, there are also both initial and ongoing country-unique costs that must be funded by
   each of the partners. These GWSS-related costs include:
       8.35.3.1. Initial Costs. International partner access to the collective system peculiar
       weapon system spares pool requires the funding to “plus up” the spares pool and to fund
       for the support services provided by organic or contractor services. The funding required
       for the initial “plus up” and ongoing support is determined by the USAF and may include
       contract costs negotiated between the USAF and the contractor. Funding to support the
       USAF is provided either by a LOA or Memorandum of Understanding depending on the
       type program established with the partners.
       8.35.3.2. Country-Unique Costs. International Partners are responsible for costs
       associated with ensuring compliance with their national laws and regulations, the
       provision of specified country-unique services and maintaining national support teams
       which are collocated with the USAF. Costs associated with configuration deviation from
       the common baseline or additional contractor services outside the scope of GWSS are the
       responsibility of the partner.

8.36. Withdrawal from GWSS. Withdrawal from GWSS will shift total cost of maintaining a
weapon system to the withdrawing partner. Access to all GWSS services, the system-peculiar
spares pool, and information sharing authorized by the TPT will not be available. The partner’s
spares pool investment may be returned on a pro-rated basis dependent on factors determined by
the USG that are equitable to the withdrawing partner and all partners who remain in GWSS.
Contracting actions entered into by the USG on behalf of the partner will be the responsibility of
the partner for the remaining term of the contract. LOAs for common weapon system support
will not be affected.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   201

                       MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Section 9A—SECURITY ASSISTANCE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
(SAMIS) OVERVIEW GUIDANCE AND DATA SUBMISSION

9.1. SAMIS (W001) Reporting Function.
   9.1.1. Sources of Data. The SAMIS (W001) maintains and reports comprehensive data on
   AFMC-managed SAPs. This information comes from many sources, mostly from AF data
   systems other than SAMIS. The primary function of SAMIS is to monitor requisitioning,
   supply, shipping and financial data to manage SA agreements.
   9.1.2. Program Status and Requisition Status. SAMIS maintains separate data bases for
   program and requisition status. Each data base is updated daily to show logistical and
   financial actions as they occur. Program data is made up of financial status and management
   data on a single SA agreement. This information is consolidated and identified by case
   designator and line item number. Requisition data includes detailed status records (“AE”
   supply status, “AS” shipment status, and delivery reports), FF (if customer negotiated),
   representing actions taken in response to individual requisitions. This information is
   consolidated by requisition DCN.
   9.1.3. Active and Inactive Data Files. Detailed requisition status is kept in SAMIS “active”
   data files for 180 days beyond requisition completion and shown on all SAMIS reports.
   Once a requisition has been closed over 180 days, the record goes to the “inactive” file.
   During this process, intermediate supply status is dropped from SAMIS records and the
   original requisitions, cancellations, shipments, requisition modifiers status from J041
   deliveries and FF data moves to inactive history. Inactive data is only shown on SAMIS
   reports when the selection parameters allow access to open, closed and completed data.
9.2. Products Available to Customers.
   9.2.1. SAP customers get some SAMIS products automatically at no cost. The U-W001-
   EAE/RCS: MTCIA(AR)8402 “Case/Line Item-Basic” goes to all customers each month.
   The U-W001-HCI “Monthly Report of Repair/Replace Deliveries” goes to applicable
   customers. The UW001-LIAF “Delinquent FF Transaction” report goes to participating
   customers. The U-W001-H DA/RCS: SAF-IAX(Q)7106, “Status of Delivery Action on
   Individual FMS Cases” (Quarterly Requisition Report) is available for automatic distribution
   when requested. Customers involved in a CLSSA are sent their related products.
   9.2.2. Other SAMIS products are available for purchase by the customer. The following
   products may be bought through an appropriate publications case. Generally, they show a
   specific condition and are not needed on a regular basis. If, however, a need arises to use one
   of these products, requests should be directed to the AFSAC case manager.
      9.2.2.1. U-W001.-HAV/RCS: MTC-IA(AR)8405, “Open Requisitions: Delinquent
      Shipping Status.” This product lists requisitions for a case or line item with supply status
      showing the materiel is available for shipment (“BA”) but without a subsequent shipment
      status. An option is available to specify the number of days this condition has existed.
202                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      9.2.2.2. U-W001.-HAF, “Delinquent Freight Forwarder Transactions.” A 3-part notice
      that gives an image of “FF” transactions that have been received and no subsequent
      transaction received within a given time parameter. Part I shows transactions for which
      subsequent XDR, XDT, XDI, XDS, or XDF transactions have not been received. Part II
      shows XDT transactions for which AE “BD” status has not been received from the source
      of repair. Part III shows XDI transaction for which no AS transaction has been received.
      HAF is produced daily in three parts.
      9.2.2.3. U-W001.-HFB, “Delinquent Freight Forwarder Transaction Summary.” A
      monthly accumulation of the daily transactions shown on Part I of U-W001.-HAF,
      produced monthly as a one-part report.
      9.2.2.4. U-W001.-JAA, “Controlled Exception Notice.” This product gives notification
      that a transaction has been suspended because it has erroneous or incompatible data and
      can't process until corrective action is taken. An image of the erroneous transaction, a
      CEX number, and up to five error codes and phrases will appear on the notice. This
      notice is used to inform a case/country or financial manager of the error and to start
      research and corrective action. Part I is provided to the AFSAC case/CMs; Part II is
      provided to Defense Attaché Office (DAO)-DE/FF showing financial transactions
      suspended that day.
      9.2.2.5. U-W001.-JAB, “Outstanding CEX Notice.” This report contains uncorrected
      SOS Financial Inventory Account (FIA) records (DOC ID = FIN) and contractor
      shipment transactions (DOC ID = CON) after 40 days. These transactions report every 40
      days until cleared. Part I is no longer produced and Part II comes out with a 7-position
      Julian date. This reporting requirement is exempt from assignment of RCS IAW AFI
      33-324, The Air Force Information Collections and Reports Management Program.
      9.2.2.6. U-W001.-HBB, “Open Requisitions: Status Code Interrogation.” This product
      lists requisitions for a country, case, or line item that are in a specific supply condition.
      An option also exists to specify the number of days a requisition has remained in that
      supply condition.
      9.2.2.7. U-W001.-HBM/RCS: MTC-IA(AR)8409, “Repair & Replace Delivery Report.”
      This report provides detailed delivery data on repair/replace requisitions for a country,
      case, or line item. This product is similar to the “Monthly Report of Repair & Replace
      Deliveries,” which is sent automatically. The difference is the ability to select the date
      parameters in which the deliveries are reported.
      9.2.2.8. U-W001.-EAN, “Case/Line Item Data for SAP” Review. This product lists case
      values for a specified case or line item, along with the number of open requisitions
      broken down by their latest supply status. As well as showing the number of requisitions,
      this report shows the longest estimated ship date within each supply category.

Section 9B—FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) DELIVERY REPORTS

9.4. FMS Delivery Reporting.
   9.4.1. The AFMC SAP delivery reporting OPR is HQ AFMC/FM. However, help from the
   SOS will be requested, if needed, to meet this responsibility.
   9.4.2. FIA records for SAPs are created in data services at each SOS and input to the D035J
   system for transmission to SAMIS. These records will be used by SAMIS along with
   matching MILSTRIP “AS” and “A0” (shipment status and requisition, respectively) to
   prepare detailed delivery records. Certain groups of equipment/materiel are exempt from this
   requirement.
      9.4.2.1. All FMS shipments direct to a customer or designated FF that are shipped from
      AF inventory or contractual sources (identified by “M,” column 80).
      9.4.2.2. All FMS unserviceable (reparable) returns to AF inventory (identified by “M,”
      column 80).
      9.4.2.3. All serviceable returns to AF inventory from an FMS customer, or FMS
      shipments from AF inventory and diverted to a SOS (identified by “M,” column 80).
   9.4.3. Serviceable returns (SCCs “A,” “B,” “C”) to AF inventory from FMS customers, or
   directed FMS shipments from the POE will be processed as shown in Chapter 8, and the
   following:
      9.4.3.1. If the transaction is a diverted shipment or other directed return (discrepant
      shipment, Materiel Deficiency Report (MDR) exhibit, SDR, etc.) and the transaction has
      been reported as delivered, the credit records for these receipts when processed, will have
      the same date as the original delivery transaction.
      9.4.3.2. If the diverted shipment transaction has not yet been reported as delivered, the
      FIA transaction should be reversed in the D035J system and passed to SAMIS.
   9.4.4. Unserviceable returns (SCCs “E,” “F,” and “G”) to AF inventory from FMS
   customers will be processed as shown in Chapter 8.
9.5. FMS Detailed Delivery Report.
   9.5.1. The FMS Detailed Delivery Report is processed monthly (see DoD 7000.14-R,
   Volume 15). This product is exempt from reporting IAW DoD 8910.1-M.
   9.5.2. The FMS detail delivery records (which result from purging the delivery suspense
   file) will be included in the monthly reporting.
   9.5.3. A hard copy of the FMS Detailed Delivery Report will be provided to DFAS-
   CO/JAK.
   9.5.4. SAMIS (W001) will process the FMS Detailed Delivery Report and update the case
   master record accordingly. SAMIS will forward this report to DFAS for further processing.
 204                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


   9.5.5. After the last shipment is made against a case, final billings should be accomplished
   within six months. Within 90 days after the case expiration date, AFSAC case manager,
   supply operations, and the SOS component will take action to speed delivery of all open
   items. On open, with unshipped requirements, requisition cases where delivery is not
   scheduled within five months, the FMS customer will be asked if the requirement still exists
   (with an idea to cancel the demand — if the cancellation will not result in additional cost to
   the AF or the FMS customer, and does not impose an undue hardship). Requisition will not
   be arbitrarily canceled. Action will not be taken against outstanding requirements for firm
   order cases or cooperative logistics requisition case requirements supported by a stock level
   case.
9.6. FMS Delivery Reporting (Physical).
   9.6.1. Requirements for FMS physical delivery reporting are detailed in DSCA Manual
   5105.38-M, paragraph C9.13.1.2. The applicable GCs are listed in DSCA Manual 5105.38-
   M, Table C9.T17 and the “C1” delivery transaction format is in Table C9.T18.
   9.6.2. Program Managers at the Product Centers are to ensure that FM support staff input the
   “C1” transactions for physical deliveries in the CMCS by the 20th of each month.

Section 9C—MILITARY ARTICLES AND SERVICES LIST (MASL)

9.7. Overview.
   9.7.1. Purpose and Scope. The MASL gives availability information through footnote codes
   for planning and programming resources (materiel, services, and training) under the MAP
   and IMET Program and the structure for ADP accounting and reporting for MAP, IEMP, and
   the FMS program. Reference Attachment 15 for a complete list of MASL footnote codes.
   The MASL is used by the DSCA to track orders and deliveries in the SAP. It serves the
   needs of GA program originators and gives information to DSCA from supplying agencies
   on identification and availability of defense articles and services, along with limited data
   processing codes and instructions. All LOAD requests must have requests for MASL
   updates when required. All items programmed for SA (MAP, IMET, and FMS) must have a
   matching entry in the MASL as a major line item NSN (or pseudo/NSN) or as a rolled-up
   dollar value line.
   9.7.2. General. The MASL has resource guidance for SA planning. It sets the level of detail
   at which GA resources are to be programmed, implemented, and reported. The MASL also
   has footnotes, MILSTRIP routine identifier, NSN, GC, classification codes, and item
   descriptions. The MASL is part of the FMS 1200 System Information reporting system.
9.8. Procedures for Processing new MASL Requests/Changes/Deletions.
   9.8.1. The AFSAC Document Preparation Branch will:
       9.8.1.1. Serve as the AF MASL focal point for all AF activities to provide guidance and
       process all new MASL requests/changes or deletions.
       9.8.1.2. Ensure the MASL materiel listing is current.
       9.8.1.3. Provide copies of the MASL materiel listing upon request. This list will include
       all current AF MASL items.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                    205


      9.8.1.4. Receive new MASL requests/changes/deletions via E-mail from any AF activity
      using the “New MASL Request Checklist” (see Attachment 16). Note the special
      requirements to address Nonrecurring Cost (NC) for SME/MDE items.
      9.8.1.5. Forward DSCA the request for new MASL or request for MASL
      changes/deletions. Time frame for MASL requests for new non-MDE MASLS is 1-2
      weeks (for new MDE MASLS, 2-4 weeks) after submission of NC documentation to
      SAF/FMB. Changes/Deletions will take 1-2 weeks to complete.
      9.8.1.6. Provide the requester with the new MASL changes/deletions when approved by
      DSCA.

Section 9D—SECURITY ASSISTANCE (SA) CUSTOMER CODES

9.9. SA Customer Codes.
   9.9.1. General. This section gives customers a reference for codes used in the SAP. It does
   not try to cover all codes used in SA, but includes those codes the customer will input and/or
   receive on various documents, transactions, listings, etc. Additional MILSTRIP codes used
   in the SAP are in AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 1 (when published):
      9.9.1.1. The codes included in this section are used along with:
      9.9.1.2. Researching part numbers and/or NSNs in FLIS.
      9.9.1.3. The preparation and processing of the LOA and its amendments and
      modifications.
      9.9.1.4. The CLSSA FMSO I and II.
      9.9.1.5. Requisitioning (“AF__” transactions).
      9.9.1.6. Requisition status transactions (“AE__”).
      9.9.1.7. Requisition shipping transactions (“AS__”).
      9.9.1.8. Delivery transactions.
      9.9.1.9. The FF tracking system.
      9.9.1.10. Standard Form 364.
      9.9.1.11. SAMIS products used by the customer.
      9.9.1.12. Buy-back transactions (“FT__”).

                         SAMIS SLQ COMPUTATION EXAMPLE

A7.1. On the first day of each quarter, SAMIS will: get the past four years of FMSO II case
recurring demand for each NSN for each country. The demands are divided into 16 quarters.
A7.2. Using the 16 quarters demand, SAMIS will: compute the AMD. In the computation,
older requisitions are weighted less than newer requisitions when there are breaks in the
quarterly requisition pattern. SAMIS applies a weighting factor to each of the quarter amounts.
The weighting factor starts at 100 percent and is reduced by 6.25 percent (100 percent/16
quarters = 6.25 percent) each time there is a zero quantity for a quarter. In this example quarter
one is the most recent.

A7.3. SAMIS then: divides the total weighted requisition QTY (9.4375) by 48 months to
determine the AMD. In this example 9.4375/48 equals 0.1966. The weighted QTY (9.4375)
will normally be less than the non-weighted requisition QTY (11).
A7.4. The AMD: is multiplied by the procurement lead time to determine the procurement SLQ.
If the SLQ computes to less than one, it is rounded to one. If the SLQ is above one, the 0.5 rule
is used (less than 0.5 is rounded down, 0.5 and greater is rounded up.) Procurement SLQ
example: 0.1966 x 24MO PLT = 4.7 = 5.
A7.5. This same logic is used for the repair SLQ:, but SAMIS uses days instead of months
because the repair time in the catalog is in days and not months.
A7.6. The CLSSA Stock Level Item Query report (QA 456): shows the 16 quarter demand
history data, the procurement and repair lead times, and the unrounded and rounded SLQ. (The
AMD can be computed as the unrounded SLQ divided by the lead time.)

A8.1. Whenever the SLQ is reduced, the reduced quantity is moved to the liability file for
processing. In the following example for one country, the SLQ is decreasing over four quarters.
In each quarter the amount of the reduction moves into the liability file for processing. Each
entry will be identified by country and date.

A8.2. Once in the liability file, an item can be removed in three ways:
     A8.2.1. First, FMS non H-coded (non-repair/replace) requisitions that process through
     SAMIS will be used to remove items from the liability file. When an item is removed from
     the liability file (and not moved to the customer’s stock level or termination file), the
     customer's liability for that NSN/quantity is cleared. The customer is no longer liable for it.
     (Exceptions: Requisitions with advice codes 6P (new and unused), BV, 6V, 6W (sole
     source), and 2C, 2J, 22, 31, 32, 33 (do not substitute) are not used to clear liability. This is
     because these codes do not allow the IM to consider all assets when filling the requisition,
     and therefore, can’t be used to clear liability file items.)
        A8.2.1.1. Quantities will be removed from the liability file first for the country that input
        the transaction, and then on a first-in first-out alphabetical basis by the date the NSN
        entered the liability file.
        A8.2.1.2. The following example shows a liability file with multiple countries and
        multiple entry dates. NSNs/quantities are placed in the liability file on the first day of the
        quarter, so it is possible for multiple countries to have entries with the same date. To
        simplify the example, actual dates aren’t used, instead date 1 is the oldest entry, date 3 is
        the newest entry.

          A8.2.1.2.1. Example 1: If a requisition is received from country CC for quantity 9,
          records 4, 9, 1, 2, 3, and 5 will be cleared. Records 4 and 9 are for country CC, the
          First-In First-Out (FIFO) alphabetical rule applies for the other records.
          A8.2.1.2.2. Example 2: If a requisition is received from country GG for quantity
          9,.records 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be cleared based on the FIFO alphabetical rule since
          country GG has no liability file entries.
          A8.2.1.2.3. Example 3: If a requisition is received from country CC for quantity
          4,.records 4 and 9 will be cleared and record 1 will be reduced by 1. Records 3 and 4
          are for country CC, the FIFO alphabetical rule applies for the other record.
   A8.2.2. Second if the SLQ increases, a corresponding quantity will be removed from the
   liability file. The liability for the removed items will be accounted for by the increased stock
   level. Quantities will be removed from the liability file by country first and then on a FIFO
   alphabetical basis by date. Example: If the stock level for country AA increases, SAMIS
   will remove liability file NSN/quantities for country AA, if it exists. If there is no country
   AA liability, SAMIS will remove NSN/quantities from the liability file using the FIFO
   alphabetical rule.
   A8.2.3. Third: If there has been no recurring demand by any FMS customer for an NSN in
   four years, the NSN/quantity will be moved to the Termination File.

     ABSORPTION REVIEW AND DRAWDOWN REQUISITION PROCESSING

A9.1. The “CLSSA Termination Absorption Request: (U-W001.-GAV) is divided into
three parts:
   A9.1.1. Part one shows cataloging data, NSN, etc., and the QTY for which absorption is
   requested.
   A9.1.2. Part two provides a brief description of the reason for the absorption request.
   A9.1.3. Part three is for the IM to enter data. It looks like this:

Table A9.1. CLSSA Termination Absorption Request
 REVIEW THE LAST FINAL REQUIREMENTS COMP. INDICATE WHETHER THE
 ITEM IS OVER, OPTIMUM, OR SHORT AT THE 3RD-TERM POINT
 OVER.......________ INDICATE OVER QUANTITY......_______
 OPTIMUM....________

 INDICATE UNFUNDED OWRM QUANTITY: _________
 INDICATE NON-PROGRAMMED
 FMS BACK ORDER QUANTITY: _________
 D200A COMPUTATION DATE: _________
 ITEM MANAGER SIGNATURE: ______________________________ DATE:________

A9.2. Instructions for Completing the request.
   A9.2.1. The majority of the request is self-explanatory. However, the following paragraphs
   provide additional detail and instructions for two special circumstances:
   A9.2.2. FMS non-programmed back order QTY. This field shows the total FMS “NP,”
   “BB,” “B4,” and “B5” FMS non-programmed non H-coded back orders that you don't intend
   to buy using FMS case funds. In other words, don't count non-programmed non H-coded
   requisitions with “BZ” or “BV” status, or those back orders that will get “BZ” or “BV”
   status.
   A9.2.3. Insurance/NSO Items. These items require special attention. Use the following
   process to determine the values to enter in the form:
      A9.2.3.1. Step 1:
          A9.2.3.1.1. If the “REQUEST QUANTITY” is included in the retention quantity,
          compute an adjusted retention QTY using the formula: Retention QTY minus the
          “REQUEST QUANTITY.”
          A9.2.3.1.2. If the “REQUEST QUANTITY” is not part of the retention quantity, no
          adjustment is necessary:
      A9.2.3.2. Step 2: Use the formula “Asset level minus the retention (Adjusted Retention)
      level” to determine the OVER (positive number), SHORT (negative number) or
      OPTIMUM (zero) position. For example:
 274                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


Table A9.2. Adjusted Retention Quantity Example
Factors                        Example 1         Example 2        Example 3
Asset Level:                     15                20               25
Retention (Adjusted Level):    - 20              - 20             - 20
                               - 5 (Short)          0 (Optimum)   + 5 (Over)
   A9.2.4. Multiple Absorption Requests and the Asset Position is “OVER.”
       A9.2.4.1. If the asset position is “OVER” and there are absorption requests for multiple
       FMS countries for the same NSN, the “OVER,” “OWRM,” and non-programmed back
       order amounts must be allocated among all the absorption requests. Here's how:
          A9.2.4.1.1. Step 1: Compute the relative percentage for each country:

Table A9.3. Relative Percentage Example
Country         “Request Qty”            Percent
BA              2                        2/12 = .17
GR              4                        4/12 = .33
AT              6                        6/12 = .50
TOTAL           12                       1.00
          A9.2.4.1.2. Step 2: Apply the percent to the “OVER,” “OWRM,” and “NON-
          PROGRAMMED BACK ORDER (NON-P) QTY” and enter the rounded (.5 up)
          result in the appropriate place on the absorption form. See the following tables for
          examples:

Table A9.4. Percentage Example 1
Country      Over     Times     Equals       Rounded
BA           10       .17       1.7          2
GR           10       3.3       3.3          3
AT           10       5         5            5

Table A9.5. Percentage Example 2
Country    OWRM       Times     Equals     Rounded
BA         8          .17       1.4        1
GR         8          .33       2.6        3
AT         8          .50       4          4

Table A9.6. Percentage Example 3
Country    Non-P     Times      Equals     Rounded
BA         15        .17        2.5        3
GR         15        .33        5.0        5
AT         15        .50        7.5        8
       A9.2.4.2. The absorption sheets would show the following information:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                275


Table A9.7. Absorption Sheet Example
COUNTRY: BA          OVER: 2,      OWRM QTY: 1,          NON-PROG BACK ORDERS: 3
COUNTRY: GR          OVER: 3,      OWRM QTY: 3,          NON-PROG BACK ORDERS: 5
COUNTRY: AT          OVER: 5,      OWRM QTY: 4,          NON-PROG BACK ORDERS: 8
          A9.2.4.2.1. If there are multiple absorption requests and the asset position is
          “SHORT” or “OPTIMUM”, it is not necessary to compute percentages and allocate
          the various amounts.
          A9.2.4.2.2. If there are multiple absorption requests and the total of the “OVER”
          quantity minus the “OWRM” minus the “NON-PROGRAMMED BACK ORDER
          QTY” is greater than the total requested absorption quantity, put the computed total
          on all the forms. Nothing can be absorbed.
   A9.2.5. NSNs with No D200A Computation. When an NSN does not have a D200A
   Computation, the “Consolidated Assets and Requirements” (A-D200A-EJ1-F9-29E) should
   be used. The IM, in coordination with their immediate supervisor, should use their best
   judgment to evaluate existing stocks and future requirements. If existing stocks will be
   needed to meet future requirements, an optimum position should be indicated on the
   Absorption Request. This will result in the item being removed from the termination file and
   liability cleared.

        SUPPLY SUPPORT ARRANGEMENT MATERIEL RETURN AGAINST
                   COOPERATIVE LOGISTICS “K” CASE

A11.1. Overview.
   A11.1.1. This attachment provides procedures for CLSSA customers to process returns for
   AF managed investment items (ERRC code “T”) using the FMSO) II case.
   A11.1.2. When authorized reparables are returned against the FMSO II case, a requisition
   for a serviceable replacement will be provided automatically. If the item is in the FMSO I
   equity list (at least one year old) and has EPQ sufficient to cover the requisition quantity, the
   requisition will be treated as programmed; otherwise, it will be treated as non-programmed.
   An “H” coded requisition will reduce the EPQ for 90 days. No credits will be processed, and
   the serviceable replacement will be priced at average repair cost, plus 3.5 percent for
   Packing, Crating, and Handling (PC&H).
   A11.1.3. If an unauthorized item (see Section 8E, paragraphs 8.23 and 8.25) is returned, a
   replacement requisition will not be created. The 430 SCMS will notify the customer of the
   unauthorized return, and will be given 30 days to provide disposition instructions, unless
   instructions are on the DD Form 1348-1A. Two choices are available to the customer:
      A11.1.3.1. Dispose of the assets.
      A11.1.3.2. Return (if possible) at the customer's expense.
   A11.1.4. Failure to respond to a request for disposition instructions within 30 days will result
   in automatic disposals.
   A11.1.5. Classified, hazardous, ammunitions, and explosive materiel will not be returned
   against a FMSO II case. Such returns will be repaired, if approval was obtained first under a
   D/O repair and return “M” case.
   A11.1.6. If an over shipment is made on an “H” coded requisition, the customer will be
   billed stock list price for the additional QTY. If the customer wants to return the materiel,
   SDR procedures must be followed.
A11.2. Lost Reparable Procedures.
   A11.2.1. Under the FMS repair/replace program, the customer returns a reparable carcass
   and a replacement requisition (“H” coded) is automatically generated. Occasionally, a
   country will ship an unserviceable carcass and an H-coded requisition will not be created.
   The country will follow-up to the case manager if an H-coded requisition has not been crated.
   Follow-up will occur as soon as possible and not later than 90 days from date of shipment.
   A11.2.2. If 90 days has elapsed from the date of shipment and the H-coded requisition has
   not been created the country will notify the case manager. When notified by the country that
   an H-coded requisition has not been created, the case manager will:
      A11.2.2.1. Research the SAMIS records. Interrogate SAMIS for H-coded requisitions
      that were created within a one-year period around the time the carcass was returned. The
      interrogation product will show a cross-reference between the returned carcass DCN and
278                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


      the H-coded DCN. If a cross-reference can be found, give the information to the
      customer. If there is not a match, the case manager will:
         A11.2.2.1.1. Determine if an SF 364 was processed by the depot against the
         shipment.
            A11.2.2.1.1.1. If an SF 364 was processed, forward to the customer and advise of
            actions being taken by the depot.
            A11.2.2.1.1.2. If the depot has not submitted an SF364, the case manager will ask
            the country to provide proof of delivery. Proof of delivery must include:
                A11.2.2.1.1.2.1. A copy of the carrier’s delivery receipt containing the legible
                date and name (or signature) of the individual who signed for the materiel at
                the repair facility.
                A11.2.2.1.1.2.2. The number of pieces, weight, and cube in the total shipment
                to agree with that shown on the supply documentation.
                A11.2.2.1.1.2.3. Requisition number and/or TCN assigned by the shipper
                identifying the materiel on the bill of lading to enable cross-referencing to the
                supply documentation.
                A11.2.2.1.1.2.4. For multi-pack or consolidated shipments, a copy of the
                packing list identifying the missing item’s requisition number contained
                within the shipment must be provided.
                A11.2.2.1.1.2.5. Copy of DD Form 1348-1A for the item in question. Any
                charges incurred obtaining the shipment documentation are the responsibility
                of the customer.
         A11.2.2.1.2. The case manager will request the 430 SCMS to research depot records
         on those assets with a ship date less than two years old. Records are not maintained
         for receipts over two years old and no research can be conducted. An H-coded
         requisition will be created for any item with a ship date over two years old, provided
         the country furnishes valid proof of delivery as outlined in paragraph A11.2.2.1.1.2.
            A11.2.2.1.2.1. The 430 SCMS will research depot records and take action as
            outlined below:
            A11.2.2.1.2.2. If it can be determined that the carcass was received, the 430
            SCMS will input a D6 receipt transaction. Normal processing will then occur. If
            necessary, the 430 SCMS will request the case manager to input a manual MRRL.
            If the MRRL is approved, normal processing occurs. If disapproved, the case
            manager will ask the country for disposition instructions and notify the 430
            SCMS of the option (dispose of the item, send to the PROS, or return at country’s
            expense) selected by the customer.
            A11.2.2.1.2.3. FMS Carcass Condemnation Procedure.
                A11.2.2.1.2.3.1. Occasionally an FMS carcass returned under the
                repair/replace program will be beyond repair, and as a result it will be
                condemned by the maintenance activity. In this instance, the FMS customer is
                still entitled to a serviceable asset. (Requisition billing will be in the normal
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                  279


                 automated manner.)
                 A11.2.2.1.2.3.2. The FMS customer is entitled to a serviceable asset because
                 the FMS customers pay the stock fund condemnations surcharge with every
                 stock fund sale made to them. The condemnations surcharge is paid by the
                 FMS customer for sales at the standard price and for sales at the repair/replace
                 price. Generally if the FMS customer pays the surcharge, they are entitled to
                 the service.
                 A11.2.2.1.2.3.3. Support of the H-code requisition from on-hand, on-order
                 stock, or from repair is preferable. If new procurement is necessary to fill the
                 requisition, stock fund obligation authority should be used to fund the
                 procurement against a stock fund line on the contract. FMS direct cite case
                 funds will not be used.
                 A11.2.2.1.2.3.4. This procedure does not apply if the carcass is condemned at
                 receiving. If condemned at receiving, the carcass will be returned to the
                 customer or sent to disposal and the customer credited disposal value.
             A11.2.2.1.2.4. If the carcass was received and an H-coded requisition couldn’t be
             created because repair capability no longer exists, the case manager will ask the
             country for disposition instructions (dispose of the item, send to PROS for
             repair/return, or return at country’s expense). The case manager will notify the
             430 SCMS of the option selected by the customer.
      A11.2.2.2. If research determines that there is no record of the item being received at the
      depot and the country provides the shipping documentation outlined in paragraph
      A11.2.2.1.1.2, an H-coded requisition will be created. If valid proof of delivery is
      furnished for materiel with a ship date more than four years old, the country will receive
      credit for the carcass value of the missing item.
A11.3. Procedures For CLSSA Customer-Submitted MRRL (“H” Requisitions).
   A11.3.1. Submission of MRRL.
      A11.3.1.1. The customer will prepare MRRLs and make sure the following is included:
         A11.3.1.1.1. Customer
         A11.3.1.1.2. Current CLSSA FMSO II case (case to be valid when reparable will be
         received at the AF depot)
         A11.3.1.1.3. MRRL control number
         A11.3.1.1.4. NSN of items involved
         A11.3.1.1.5. Quantity of unserviceables intended for return
         A11.3.1.1.6. Noun
         A11.3.1.1.7. Priority (equal to the FMS customer's need at estimated time of CONUS
         reparable receipt)
         A11.3.1.1.8. Supplementary address (shown on the MILSTRIP requisition in rp 45-
         50, service code, ORC, FF; case designator).
280                                                      AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


         A11.3.1.1.9. DCN (rp 30-35 of the MILSTRIP requisition includes service code “D,”
         geopolitical code, mark-for code, delivery term code, TA code-”V”) will be used for
         out-shipment from repair facility.
         A11.3.1.1.10. Disposition instructions to be used if the item is condemned upon
         receipt.
         A11.3.1.1.11. The AF processing and return of the FMS customer MRRL will be
         accomplished within 45 days.
      A11.3.1.2. The customer will send one copy of the MRRL to the 430 SCMS.
  A11.3.2. Processing MRRLs.
      A11.3.2.1. After getting the MRRLs, the 430 SCMS will ensure all required data has
      been provided. The 430 SCMS will not process incomplete MRRLs and will ask the
      customer to resubmit the MRRL. The 430 SCMS must get approval from the AFSAC
      case manager if a DTC other than “5” is on the MRRLs. The case manager will
      coordinate the approval of any DTC other than “5” with HQ AFMC/A4R before
      answering the 430 SCMS.
      A11.3.2.2. The 430 SCMS will input a “9__” transaction to generate a MRRL Request
      List in IMS manager designator code sequence. The MRRL list will include H036B
      actual average repair cost for items.
      A11.3.2.3. If a customer's MRRL is received by an organization other than the 430
      SCMS, the receiving organization will send the MRRL to the 430 SCMS for action with
      an informational copy to the customer.
      A11.3.2.4. The MRRL request list will be sent to the 430 SCMS for renew. The IMS
      will provide the following data to the 430 SCMS in 15 days:
         A11.3.2.4.1. Items authorized for return to CONUS.
         A11.3.2.4.2. “Ship to” Address. Enter the Stock Record Account Number (SRAN)
         of the SRA to which the item is to be shipped, if other than the “FB20__” number
         mechanically assigned.
         A11.3.2.4.3. If there is not a current H036B repair cost, the IMS will get the actual
         repair cost from the production specialist. If the actual repair cost is not available, the
         IMS will compute the current standard price using the OSD escalation table.
         A11.3.2.4.4. The IMS is not required to review a MRRL quantity against D200A.
         Also, assets will not be input into D200A as due-in assets.
         A11.3.2.4.5. The IMS will not approve any items for return if the AF is not the
         manager; the items are obsolete to any existing system configuration, or there is no
         repair capability. The IMS will try to forecast the management status of NSNs in
         question for the following six months before accepting return of those items. The
         IMS will give a reason for rejection.
      A11.3.2.5. After getting the annotated MRRL listing from the IMS, the 430 SCMS will
      prepare “9A” transactions which will establish due-in suspenses for approved items.
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                     281


      A11.3.2.6. The 430 SCMS will send the MRRL approved/ unapproved list to the
      appropriate customer.
      A11.3.2.7. The customer will have 180 days from the date of establishment of the
      suspense to return the item to the CONUS.
      A11.3.2.8. For those items on the MRRL request which are not AF reparable items and
      have been disapproved for return, the “MRRL Non-AF List” will be created. AFSAC
      will send this report to the appropriate FMS customer.
A11.4. Preauthorized Repair/Replace.
   A11.4.1. Items which are on a customer's FMSO I and all I&S grouped NSNs that have a
   repair source are eligible for preauthorized repair/replace under the FMSO II case. The
   listing of preauthorized NSNs (along with authorized MRRLs) is sent to the customer on the
   “Quarterly MRRL Status List” U-WO001-HIA. SAMIS Product U-WOO1.-HIA is the PCN
   for the consolidated listing.
   A11.4.2. The NSNs and quantities listed on the UWOO1.HIA may be returned to the AF for
   repair under the Repair/Replace program. NSNs that are not on the report or quantities
   greater than shown on the report are not authorized for return.
   A11.4.3. Each month AFSAC will generate the appropriate file maintenance transaction for
   the NSNs added or deleted on the FMSO I cases. The adjustments will be coordinated with
   the 430 SCMS. The updated listings will be given to the AFSAC case managers and the
   customers.
A11.5. Return of Reparables.
   A11.5.1. After getting AF processed MRRLs, the FMS customer will arrange for shipments
   of approved reparables within the designated time frame. The FMS customer will not
   substitute items with an NSN different than those approved on the MRRL
   approved/disapproved list. If the FMS customer is returning items to more than one TRC,
   items for each TRC must be packed in separate shipping containers and each addressed for
   the appropriate TRC. Each individual shipping container which has multiple line items must
   be marked MULTIPACK.
   A11.5.2. FMSO I NSNs which are preauthorized for repair/replace are intermingled on the
   U-WOO1.-HIA list. If the customer's FMSO I reparable is one of the preauthorized NSNs,
   there will be a ship-to-address (“FB20__”) on the listing.
   A11.5.3. Processing Reparable Shipments.
      A11.5.3.1. Three copies of the DD Form 1348-1A will be prepared by the customer for
      each item. Instructions for preparing forms for standard MRRLs are in Table A11.1
      Instructions for preparing forms for preauthorized MRRLs are in Table A11.2
      A11.5.3.2. Shipments of unserviceable returns will go through the FMS customer FF;
      cleared through US customs, and shipped to the designated repair activity on a prepaid
      CBL, unless use of DTS has been authorized in the LOA. If unserviceable returns are
      sent by FMS customer aircraft to a CONUS AF base, it will be the FMS customer's
      responsibility, through the aircraft crew or customer FF; to get necessary customs
      clearance. All materiel from off the aircraft, except materiel to be left at the base of entry
 282                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


       will be shipped to the FMS customer FF by collect CBL, for further distribution to the
       appropriate TRC. The FMS customer will be responsible for all necessary coordination
       with the FF.
       A11.5.3.3. One copy (number 2) of the DD Form 1348-1A will be attached to the outside
       of the container in a waterproof envelope. If items are consolidated for shipment, one
       copy of the DD Form 1348-1A for each item in the container will be placed on the
       outside of the number one container.
       A11.5.3.4. One copy (number 3) of the DD Form 1348-1A will be placed inside each
       container for each item (including consolidated shipment).
       A11.5.3.5. One copy (number 1) of the DD Form 1348-1A will be kept by the customer
       making the shipment.
       A11.5.3.6. All containers will be clearly labeled “FMS Reparable Shipment,
       Repair/Replace.”
       A11.5.3.7. FMS returns to CONUS are allowed duty free entry to the US. Free entry is
       provided by Item 800 of the Tariff Schedules of the US (19 USC 1202). A customs
       declaration form must be prepared and go along with each reparable shipment.
       A11.5.3.8. A packing list must accompany the bill of lading or equivalent on all
       consolidated shipments.
A11.6. Receipt of Reparables.
   A11.6.1. After getting the reparables, the responsible depot receiving unit will open each
   shipping container and visually inspect the bare item(s). A visual judgment will be made as
   to whether the item is physically damaged beyond repair. Also, the item identification
   (NSN) and quantity of the item(s) will be checked to be sure there is agreement with the data
   on the DD Form 1348-1A and the pack list which started the shipment from country.
   A11.6.2. If the identity or quantity of materiel differs from the DD Form 1348-1A data, the
   responsible depot receiving unit will manually correct all applicable DD Forms 1348-1A they
   have to show actual NSN(s) and quantity received. The responsible depot receiving unit will
   send a clear copy of the DD Form 1348-1A to the 430 SCMS, explaining the discrepancy in
   the “Remarks” block of that copy.
   A11.6.3. The responsible depot receiving unit will create a “D6” receipt transaction using
   data from the corrected DD Form 1348-1A. The “D6” will be input to the D035 system.
A11.7. Generation of Replacement Requisition.
   A11.7.1. The “D6” receipts will be compared to the “9A” MRRL suspenses. When a match
   occurs, the suspense will be cleared, and a replacement requisition will generate, which will
   be identified by an “H” in column 40. The requisition will carry advice code “28” in rp 65-
   66.
   A11.7.2. For preauthorized MRRLs, the requisition will be passed to SAMIS where it will
   be rejected as a CEX on the daily error report with the error phrase “Type Commitment Code
   Invalid.” The AFSAC case manager will correct the CEX and re-input the A01 requisition,
   inserting the FMSO II master case designator in rp 48-50 and the last two positions of the
   FMSO II line item in rp 55-56. Additional changes include:
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   283


     A11.7.2.1. FF code “X” (rp 47) to the correct FF code.
     A11.7.2.2. Priority “XX” (rp 60-61) to the priority designated by the UND “C” unless
     UND “A” or “B” can be justified. If the priority is not changed, SAMIS will
     automatically change it to the lowest priority within the country’s F/AD.
     A11.7.2.3. The CEX will be cancelled after the requisition is re-input.
     A11.7.2.4. At the same time that SAMIS rejects the “A0l” requisition on a CEX, the
     “BD” status line which cross references the customer's shipping document to the “H”
     coded document will be rejected as a CEX. After the “A01” requisition is reestablished,
     the case manager will re-input the “BD” status line using the same information in the
     “A01” requisition.
  A11.7.3. Occasionally an FMS carcass returned under the Repair/Replace program will be
  beyond repair, and as a result, it will be condemned by the maintenance activity. In this
  instance the FMS customer is still entitled to a serviceable asset. (Requisition billing will be
  in the normal automated manner.) Since the FMS customers pay the stock fund
  condemnations surcharge with every stock fund sale made to them at the exchange price (the
  Repair/Replace price). If the FMS customer pays the surcharge, they are entitled to the
  service. Support of the H-code requisition from on-hand, on-order stock, or from repair is
  preferable. If new procurement is necessary to fill the requisition, stock fund obligation
  authority should be used to fund the procurement against a stock fund line on the contract.
  FMS direct cite case funds will not be used. This procedure does not apply if the carcass is
  condemned at receiving. If condemned at receiving, the carcass will be returned to the
  customer, or sent to disposal and the customer credited disposal value.
     A11.7.3.1. When the item is condemned, the SOS will perpetuate SCC “H” in the daily
     “MRRL Master Adjustment & Error List” output to the 430 SCMS. The “D6” receipts
     will be compared to the “9A” MRRL suspenses. When a match occurs, the suspense will
     be cleared, and a replacement requisition will generate, which will be identified by an
     “H” in column 40. The 430 SCMS will ship the condemned item to DLA Distribution
     Services according to prescribed procedures. The data elements in paragraph A11.9
     will be included on the DTID to identify the item as an FMS-owned asset. The supply
     inspector will certify the condemned condition by putting his stamp in the remarks block.
  A11.7.4. If the MRRL is a manual MRRL and the “D6” receipt quantity exceeds that of the
  “9A” MRRL suspense, an exception report will be produced for the 430 SCMS (MRRL
  Weekly Status, Part 2: Unmatched Reparable Returns ). The 430 SCMS will ask the IMS if
  the excess quantity is acceptable. The 430 SCMS will then establish a new “9A” record for
  the excess for normal processing. Requisitions will have “28” in rp 65-66.
  A11.7.5. If the NSN of the “D6” receipt does not match the “9A” MRRL suspense, the SOS
  will include the transaction in the “MRRL Weekly Status Report Part 2-Unmatched
  Reparable Returns FMS” output to the 430 SCMS. The 430 SCMS will tell the applicable
  IMS that the item of unmatched NSN has been received. The IMS will notify the 430 SCMS
  within 15 days if repair capability exists and the item can be accepted (the item must have an
  ERRC “T” and meet acceptance criteria.
     A11.7.5.1. If the item can be accepted, the 430 SCMS will notify the customer.
284                                                    AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014


         A11.7.5.1.1. For manual MRRLs, the FMS customer will have 30 days to notify the
         430 SCMS if repair/replacement of the item is wanted. At the same time, the 430
         SCMS will ask the FMS customer or the case manager to provide disposition
         instructions, if they do not appear, in block FF, DD Form 1348-1A.
         A11.7.5.1.2. For preauthorized MRRLs, the 430 SCMS will input a “9A” transaction
         for normal processing.
      A11.7.5.2. If the unmatched NSN cannot be accepted by the IMS, the 430 SCMS will
      follow disposition instructions, if they appear; in block FF of the DD Form 1348-1A. If
      disposition instructions do not appear, the 430 SCMS will ask the AFSAC case manager
      for disposition instructions.
         A11.7.5.2.1. If the FMS customer wants disposal of the item, the 430 SCMS will tell
         the IMS that the depot receiving unit has received a reparable item which is to be
         processed for disposal. The 430 SCMS will also give the IMS data elements listed in
         paragraph A11.9 The IMS will include the data elements on the DTID to identify
         the item as an FMS-owned asset. A copy of the DTID will go to the 430 SCMS to
         clear the unmatched D6 receipt.
         A11.7.5.2.2. If the FMS customer wants return of an unmatched reparable, and return
         is possible, the 430 SCMS will manually prepare two books (12 copies) of DD Form
         1348-1A, which will start shipment to the customer. The original FMS DCN must be
         used and the unit price of the item must be on the DD Form 1348-1A. The reason for
         the return must be in the Remarks block of the DD Forms 1348-1A. The 430 SCMS
         will then send the DD Forms 1348-1A to the responsible depot receiving unit. The
         responsible depot receiving unit will input a “D6” reversal transaction to DSS
         according to AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 4, Wholesale and Retail Receiving/Shipping
         (WARRS) System Users’ Manual (D035K/L) and send the remaining copies of the DD
         Form 1348-1A to Depot Shipment and Planning. Depot Shipment and Planning will
         start return shipment on a CCBL. Depot Shipment and Planning will establish the
         outbound shipment in the D009 system by a transaction so that a record of shipment
         is created. Once shipment action has been completed, Depot Shipment and Planning
         will send a copy of the completed DD Form 1348-1, with shipping data annotated, to
         the 430 SCMS. The 430 SCMS will then compute the PC&H charge and prepare
         manual delivery reporting for the PC&H as a services delivery.
  A11.7.6. The 430 SCMS will provide the FMS customer with the weekly “Return
  Requisition List” , which cross-references DCNs of FMS customer-submitted DD Forms
  1348-1A with document numbers of replacement requisitions generated.
  A11.7.7. When an SDR results from a shipment on an “H” coded requisition and when that
  SDR has been validated and the AF agrees that items must be shipped to the FMS customer
  to fulfill AF responsibility to replace authorized returns against a MRRL, the following will
  be taken:
      A11.7.7.1. The 430 SCMS will process a “D6” receipt to produce an “H” series
      requisition.
      A11.7.7.2. The 430 SCMS will write in block 26 of the SF 364 the requisition number
      that was generated for the quantity to meet the validated SDR. The resultant requisition
AFMCMAN20-2 16 JANUARY 2014                                                                   285


         will be processed for supply on a normal basis current repair price, plus 3.5 percent for
         PC&H.
     A11.7.8. In the case of an incorrect cancellation of an “H” coded requisition, the AFSAC
     case manager will contact the IMS. The IMS will send positive supply status to SAMIS so
     that the requisition can be reopened.
A11.8. Country Documentation Preparation for Reparable Shipments (Standard
MRRL). A DD Form 1348-1A will be prepared manually or mechanically for all reparable
shipments by country (standard MRRL). All copies will be complete, accurate, and legible. The
basic principle is to provide requisition information on the DD Form 1348-1A whenever
possible. The data in Table A11.1 will be entered on all FMS documents.

Table A11.1. Country Preparation of DD Form 1348-1A for Reparable Shipment by

 DD-EE      Annotate Free Entry-Item 800 of Tariff Schedules of US (14 USC 1202)
 FF         Enter either DISPOSE OR RETURN. These disposition instructions will be
            used for unauthorized returns of items received at the US repair facility.
            DISPOSE will result in the customer receiving scrap value of the item (90
            percent of 1.6 percent of current stock list price). RETURNS will result in the
            item being returned at the customer's expense. These instructions must appear
            on each DD Form 1348-1A.
A11.9. Disposal Data Elements. The following data elements will be entered on the DTID to
identify condemned and reparable items shipped to DLA Distribution Services Federal Center;
Battle Creek Michigan 49016 as FMS-owned assets. The data elements will be used by DLA
Distribution Services to deposit a percentage of the proceeds from sales to the FMS customer's
trust fund holding account (“XLC”).
   A11.9.1. Phrase: FMS-Owned Assets.
   A11.9.2. Country and activity code.
   A11.9.3. Reimbursement code “3.”
   A11.9.4. Trust fund holding account “XLC.”
   A11.9.5. FMS country DCN from the receipt document.
A11.10. Country Preparation for Reparable Shipment (Preauthorized Repair). A DD
Form 1348-1A will be prepared manually or mechanically for all reparable shipments by country
(preauthorized repair). All copies will be complete, accurate, and legible. The idea is to give

               BLANKET ORDER (B/O) REPAIR AND RETURN CASES

A13.1. General.
   A13.1.1. B/O repair and return cases give the FMS customer repair/maintenance service for
   unexpected repair requirements. These types of cases give only the dollar amount of
   potential repair services and the period of the case which is one year. The LOA usually
   states that the case applies only to systems/subsystems of US origin and under the cognizance
   of the AF. Repair capability, organic or contractual, is, however; decided on an item-by-item
   basis as the actual repair requirements are identified by the FMS customer. Organic or
   contract repair will be determined by using the posture planning process. Under repair and
   return procedures, the FMS customer returns an unserviceable item and gets the same item
   back in serviceable condition, assuming the repair was economically possible. Internally, the
   AF will use depot maintenance service, AFIF (DM5) funding for all B/O repair and return
   cases.
   A13.1.2. Repair/return items must use unique DTC for transportation to and from repair
   activities. These DTCs are used by AFSAC case managers in preparing repair/return LOAs.
   A13.1.3. Non-standard items. Additional information is in Section 9C. FMS customers
   must report to the AFSAC case manager those assets for which repair/return is needed. Do
   not initiate shipment before receipt of shipping instructions from the AF.
   A13.1.4. Depot-level maintenance requests will be processed through B/O repair/return
   cases. Requirements which must be identified include:
      A13.1.4.1. Manpower - organic and contractual.
      A13.1.4.2. Materiel - Contractor furnished equipment/GFE.
      A13.1.4.3. Tooling.

       A14.2.1.1. The customer will identify the reparable items to be returned to the AF for
       repair/replace.
       A14.2.1.2. Customers will send a LOR to the AFSAC case manager for a D/O
       repair/return maintenance case.
       A14.2.1.3. After getting the LOR, the AFSAC case manager will:
          A14.2.1.3.1. Determine the AFLCMC FMS program Office with management
          responsibility for each item in the customer's LOR.
          A14.2.1.3.2. Prepare a request for P&A (according to Figure A14.1 and pricing
          guidelines in DoD 7000.14-R) and send to each applicable AFLCMC Program
          Office, with a 30-day suspense for completing the P&A. The case manager will
          ensure the requirement for repair/return is clearly stated.
       A14.2.1.4. The AFLCMC FMS Program Office will complete the P&A data and make
       sure all data elements in Figure A14.1, are provided and returned to the AFSAC case
       manager within 30 days. If repair/return services, either organically or contractually, are
       not available for an item, the AFLCMC FMS Program Office will explain the reason and
       state if repair/replace methods or PROS can be used. The AFLCMC FMS Program
       Office must try to find a contractor who can do repair/return for a requested item, if the
       service cannot be done organically. No funds may be paid to a contractor in order to get
       P&A data.
   A14.2.2. Preparation of LOAs. The AFSAC case manager will prepare an LOA, send it to
   the purchaser, and implement the case IAW AFMAN 16-101. The AFSAC case manager
   will then prepare an international program directive (IPD) to the AFLCMC FMS Program
   Office.

A         Availability associated with production capability.
B         Available for future delivery only.
C         Under study by research and development (R&D).
D         Limited supply available. Replacement or preferred item, if any, is also listed in the
          MASL. Under normal circumstances, preferred item should be programmed.
H         Ancillary equipment must be programmed separately.
J         Spell out desired configuration in separate correspondence.
K         MILSTRIP RIC (MRI) data field in the MASL has been left blank because this is a
          dollar value line for which the program originator is required to select the
          appropriate implementing agency. Program originators will enter the appropriate
          MRI in rp 66-68 of card 3 as follows:
          MRI – Implementing Agency
          BY7 - Army
          NBZ - Navy
          Faϕ - AF
          In selecting the implementing agency, the objective is to identify the military
          department best positioned to provide the required articles or service. As a general
          rule, the military department which is the normal recipient of MAP orders for the
          related end item (as indicated by the MRI assigned to the end item in the MASL) is
          in the best position to provide ancillary equipment and efficient and effective follow-
          on support.
          Source of supply codes “B,” “F,” “J,” “N,” “0,” “R,” “S,” or “T” require the use of
          specific MRIs. Where the source code is “J,” always use MRI code “W~3.” Where
          the source code is “S,” always use MRI code “FAϕ.” Program originators will
          determine the proper MRI from the headquarters directing the use of source codes
          “B,” “F,” “N,” ‘‘O,” “R” or “T.”
L         Items supplied in a variety of voltages and configurations. If shipment is to be
          effected direct to country without mounting in a vehicle or aircraft within CONUS,
          spell out the required voltage of the item by separate correspondence.
NN or N   No source of supply normally available to MAP. However, in special
          circumstances, military department assets are made available to meet MAP
          requirements. Military Assistance Advisory Groups (MAAGs) should not program
          articles footnote coded “NN” unless previously advised of specific availability and
          price by the supplying military department(implementing agency).
PP or P   For use by DSCA — Indicates a summary line.
