This instruction implements AFPD 21-2, Non-Nuclear and Nuclear Munitions, 8 Jun 93, and AFI 21-201,
Management and Maintenance of Non-Nuclear Munitions, 13 Jan 03, and establishes demilitarization and
disposition policies, responsibilities, and procedures relating to requirements governing the concept,
research, development, engineering, and release for production for all new or modified ammunition items.
This instruction requires that, to the maximum extent possible, ammunition be designed for demilitariza-
tion and also requires the development of a formal demilitarization plan to accomplish safe and environ-
mentally acceptable demilitarization/disposition of the ammunition.
Supplements to this regulation are prohibited. Send suggested or required changes to the Service Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR).


1. Background. This regulation expands and implements the joint agreement on demilitarization/dispo-
sition requirements relating to the design of new or modified ammunition items issued by the Command-
ers of AMC/NAVSEA/AFLC dated 14 April 1976. It applies to developers involved in developing or
modifying ammunition items.

2. Scope. This regulation applies to AMC/NAVSEA/AFMC/MARCORSYSCOM Headquarters, major
subordinate commands, installations, activities, depots, laboratories, and project/program managers hav-
ing responsibilities for disposition requirements relating to the design of new or modification of ammuni-
tion items.

3. Objectives. The objectives of this regulation are to:
   3.1. Influence the design of new or modified munitions items to facilitate the eventual demilitariza-
   tion and disposition of the item by cost effective, safe, and environmentally acceptable means. Assure
2                                                                         AFMCI21-131 16 JUNE 2004


    that the design allows demilitarization and disposition in accordance with (IAW) the requirements of
    DoDI 5000.2.
    3.2. Identify the processes, procedures and equipment necessary to effect the safe and environmen-
    tally acceptable demilitarization and disposition of a munitions item.
    3.3. Assure that demilitarization or disposition and disposal considerations are an integral part of the
    planning and decision-making processes for all new or modified ammunition items from conception
    to final acceptance of the end item.
    3.4. Provide for review and approval of demilitarization or disposition and disposal considerations
    and plans in accordance with program management procedures and in all instances prior to opera-
    tional test and evaluation (OT&E).

Terms
Ammunition—The term ammunition as applied in this regulation includes all non-surety ordnance
components and explosives prepared to form a charge, complete round, or cartridge for small arms, rifle,
gun, cannon or any other weapon or explosive-actuated device, impulse device, torpedo warhead, mine,
bomb, grenades, depth charge, fuze, detonator, projectile, rocket or guided missile. Ammunition also
includes all solid propellants, explosives, hypergolic liquid propellant systems, and other hazardous
materials applied to ordnance uses and requiring surveillance for reasons of explosive safety and all Jet
Assisted Take Off (JATOs) rockets, boosters, sustainers, military pyrotechnics, tactical missiles and
non-surety chemical materials.
Demilitarization—The act of destroying the military offensive or defensive advantage inherent in
ammunition. This process may be applied to serviceable, unserviceable, used or unused items, which are
excess, obsolete, or uneconomically repairable, as well as, items determined to be hazardous for
continued storage. Examples of ammunition demilitarization methods are disassembly, washout,
melt-out, incineration, deactivation, mutilation, chemical neutralization, open burning, open detonation,
or static firing. The environmentally and safety-approved methods will render the item inert and no longer
usable for military applications.
Disposition—The process of redistributing, transferring, donating, selling, demilitarizing, treating,
destroying or other end of life cycle guidance for DoD personal property. Disposition is the final stage of
an asset’s life cycle prior to exiting the DoD system. The item must pass through a specific system or set
of guidance and controls to ensure that re-utilization, transfer, or sale options are exhausted by the
appropriate Inventory Control Point (ICP). Examples of authorized means are reuse, recycling,
conversion, or sale to an authorized buyer. In some instances, the act of demilitarization accomplishes
disposal, as well. Disposal methods such as ocean dumping or land burial of items containing energetic
materials are not typically authorized.
Disposal—End of life (EOL) Tasks and/or Actions for residual materials resulting from demilitarization
or disposition operations.
Demilitarization/Disposition Plan—A written document that describes the item and identifies
processes, procedures and equipment necessary to effect the safe and environmentally acceptable
demilitarization or disposition, and disposal of the new or modified ammunition item. Instructions and an
example of a Demilitarization/Disposition Plan are contained in Appendix A.
AFMCI21-131 16 JUNE 2004                                                                          5


Resource Recovery and Recycling (R3)—A term used to describe a family of processes/technologies
for demilitarization of ammunition using processes other than open burning and open detonation which
results in all or part of the ammunition’s components being recovered for recycle and reuse.
Developers—Manufacturers, vendors, contractors, activities, commands, laboratories, centers, and
program offices involved in developing munitions items.

                            DEMILITARIZATION/DISPOSITION PLAN
GUIDELINES
Basic guidelines and standard format information is provided below to assist in the development of demil-
itarization/disposition plans.
1. Demilitarization/disposition plans are not developed for emergency demilitarization.
2. All plans should be based on disassembly to the lowest level necessary to gain access to or remove
energetic hazardous materials or components for demilitarization or disposition.
3. OB/OD are not considered the primary demilitarization or disposition option.
4. Plans for items containing subassemblies should be developed in tiers or appendices with a plan for the
end item and individual plans for each subassembly. This is especially true for subassemblies that may be
stocked as individual items in the supply system. An example; a 3”/50 cartridge consisting of a cartridge
case, primer, propellant, projectile and fuze. Plans should be developed for the cartridge, primer and fuze
separately. Disposition guidance for “after use” components such as cans, clips, cartridge cases and
wooden boxes should also be developed.
5. The use of reference documents (e.g., TMs, TOs, Navy Instructions, DMWRs, SOPs, or approved
Demilitarization/Disposition Plans) to satisfy portions of plan requirements is encouraged. However, ref-
erence documents (or applicable portions) used in this manner must accompany the plan.
6. Information on existing and emerging demilitarization and disposition alternatives for families of
munitions are maintained by the JOCG at the Munitions Items Disposition Action System (MIDAS) web
site (http://www.dac.army.mil).
7. Demilitarization of both energetic and inert components to prevent reuses IAW the requirements of the
latest publication of DOD 4160.21-M-1 shall be addressed in the plan.
