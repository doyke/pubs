1. GENERAL INFORMATION
   1.1. General. The Dover Weather Flight (WF) provides and/or arranges for weather support
   to the 436th Airlift Wing, 512th Airlift Wing, and transient units on Dover AFB, DE. The
   Weather Flight is the focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction establishes
   requirements and procedures pertaining to weather support during peacetime operations.
      1.1.1. Changes in requirements and support capabilities will be published as changes to
      this instruction. A biennial review of this instruction will be conducted by all tasked
      agencies. OPR for this review will be the Dover Weather Station.
      1.1.2. According to AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities. An
      Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) will provide resource protection, terminal
      aerodrome forecasts, regional, and operational-level weather products and information,
      meteorological watch (METWATCH), and flight weather briefing support for Air Force
      locations within designated geographic regions. The 15th Operational Weather Squadron
      (OWS) at Scott AFB provides this support for Dover AFB.
      1.1.3. The Dover Weather Station will focus on providing tactical-level weather products
      and information needed for mission execution.
   1.2. The Dover Weather Station Mission. The Dover Weather Station is organized,
   trained, and equipped to conduct weather operations in order to provide timely, accurate, and
   relevant weather information and products to professionally support the 436th AW, 512th AW
   and all tenant units on Dover AFB. More specifically, the Dover Weather Station will take
   and disseminate all required surface weather observations to include all prescribed elements
   to local customers over the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET); collaborate with the 15 OWS
 4                                                   DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


     in producing and disseminating weather watches, warnings, and advisories; provide Mission
     Weather Products (MWP) and flight weather briefings for local and transient aircrews and
     conduct MISSIONWATCH for these forecasts; and act as ―eyes forward or the 15 OWS.
     Dover Weather flight will focus on providing tactical-level weather products and information
     needed for mission execution and provide weather products and information to the
     commander of deployed forces during wartime, contingency, and exercise operations.
     1.3. Responsibilities. General responsibilities of the OWSs and WFs are outlined in AFI
     15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of the 15
     OWS and Dover’s WF are defined in the OWS-KDOV Data Page located on the 15 OWS
     web      page      (https://ows.scott.af.mil/ows_unique/15/TECH_REF/MOAS/MOAS/Docs/
     Dover%20Data%20Page.xlsx) and in this instruction. The 15 OWS issues Dover’s Terminal
     Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), forecasted weather warnings, watches, advisories, and will
     provide flight weather briefings to transient aircrews passing through Dover that cannot be
     supported by the WF. In addition, the 15 OWS will issue observed warnings and advisories
     when the WF is closed. The WF will issue all observed advisories and warnings and create
     tailored weather products focused on the local mission when open during normal duty hours.
     Additionally, the WF will support the base in educating agencies on the purpose and
     applicability of weather products as required by regulations (AFI 10-2501) or directed by the
     436 AW/CC.
     1.4. Duty Priorities.
        1.4.1. 15 OWS Duty Priorities. 15 OWS duty priorities exist to match and balance
        limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities focus efforts during peak
        work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts. Weather operators will use
        good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially when there is imminent
        danger to life and/or property. Specific duty priorities are outlined in OWS-KDOV Data
        Page
        1.4.2. Dover WF Duty Priorities. WF duty priorities are listed in Table 1.1. Flight
        personnel will use good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially
        when there is imminent danger to life and/or property.

        18             Accomplish all other routine tasks
       1.4.3. Leadership will apply Risk Management principles and processes to day-to-day
       weather operations to focus activities and allocate resources of the weather unit to exploit
       environmental conditions, mitigate mission delays, and enhance the overall effectiveness
       of operations.
   1.5. Operational Hours. The Dover WF has reduced hours of operation (limited duty). On
   normal duty days the hours of operation are 0600L to 1800L. The WF is closed on weekends
   and holidays (see Limited Duty Memo Template, Figure 7.1.). When the WF has to evacuate
   to the Alternate Operating Location (AOL), services may not be immediately available.
   After normal duty hours, the WF technicians are on standby status. Limited staff services,
   listed in Chapter 5, are usually available during normal duty hours or as required (e.g.,
   exercises, etc). See Table 1.2 for contact information.

       1.5.1. Flight leadership will coordinate and establish the periods when the weather flight
       will be closed and develop a stand-by schedule when necessary. The 15 OWS and
       Command Post will be formally notified and provided with a list and schedule of standby
       WF members.
             1.5.1.1. Flight leadership will notify the 15th OWS, Operations Superintendent or
             regional zone OIC when temporary changes to duty hours occur (e.g., Family Day,
             Goal Day, other closures/extensions). This notification will be made no later than 24
             hours in advance of the closure to allow the 15th OWS to reallocate its resources, as
             required.
       1.5.2. Changes to regularly scheduled operating hours published in the FLIPs must be
       published in NOTAMS by coordinating with 436 OSS/OSA Airfield Management to
       include remarks permanently. Notification may be by either Memo or e-mail.
   1.6. Automated and Augmented Observations.
       1.6.1. The FMQ-19 (AMOS) will be set to transmit fully automated observations during
       normal operations.
 6                                                    DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


           1.6.1.1. Automated Dissemination System. In this manual, Automated
           Dissemination System (ADS) refers to any Air Force or Army accredited
           dissemination system (e.g., N-TFS, Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET), or Advanced
           Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS)).
       1.6.2. Automated Observations.
           1.6.2.1. Automated weather observations will only be manually supplemented
           (augmented) and/or backed-up for elements required in AFMAN 15-111 Table 3.1.
           Supplementation/back-up is for the specific observation elements that are missing or
           incorrect due to sensor and/or communication failure.
           1.6.2.2. Automated observations are identified by the text “AUTO” between the time
           and wind groups, and the addition of the characters “AO2” in the remarks.
               Example: METAR KDOV 011055Z AUTO 26012KT 10SM CLR 15/05 A2990
               RMK A02 SLP117
           1.6.2.3. If supplementation or backup is required, the observations will not contain
           the “AUTO” but will have “AO2A” in the remarks.
               Example: METAR KDOV 011055Z 26012KT 10SM CLR 15/05 A2990 RMK
               AO2A SLP117
       1.6.3. Augmented (Supplemented/Back-up) Observations. Augmentation is the
       process of having position-qualified weather technicians manually add or edit data to an
       observation generated by a properly sited AMOS. The two augmentation processes used
       are supplementing and back-up. Supplementing is a method of manually adding
       meteorological information to an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of
       the AMOS to detect and/or report. Back-up, except for some automated remarks; back-
       up refers to weather technicians providing the same reporting capability as that provided
       by the AMOS
           1.6.3.1. Mandatory supplementing is required only when criteria in AFMAN 15-111
           Table 3.1. are met or expected.

            Except for some automated remarks, back-up refers to weather technicians providing
            the same reporting capability as that provided by the AMOS. There is no requirement
            to back-up the system/sensor when the airfield is closed, unless tornadic activity is
            occurring or forecast to occur, then back-up and supplement as necessary.
                1.6.3.2.1. Weather technicians will back-up the AMOS equipment if the
                system/sensor(s) is/are not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or
                communication failure.

            1.6.3.3. Sensor Back-up During WF Closure, when Airfield is Open. WF
            personnel will be recalled from standby to back-up the AMOS sensors when criteria
            in Table 1.6. occur.
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                                           9

Altimeter                         If all altimeter sensors are INOP

        1.6.4. Supplementing AMOSs. Weather technicians, unless otherwise specified, must
        physically be within five statute miles (SM) of the center of the aerodrome when
        supplementing an AMOS. Weather technicians will supplement observations when the
        airfield is open and the weather conditions in AFMAN 15-111 Table 3.1. are observed.
        Weather technicians will perform a BWW from the observing location and be ready to
        supplement observations if the conditions in AFMAN 15-111 Table 3.1. are forecast to
        occur within 2 hours. Weather personnel are required to log on to an AMOS and be
        prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic
        activity. Weather technicians are not required to supplement during airfield closure hours
        for other AFMAN 15-111 Table 3.1. criteria.
        1.6.5. Note: This does not relieve weather flights of their AFI 10-229 responsibilities for
        responding to severe weather events during non-duty hours. Weather flights will
        continue to have Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) in place to respond to
        severe weather threats. Weather flights should concentrate their SWAP efforts on eyes
        forward resource protection and notification efforts during airfield closure hours.
    1.7. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
        1.7.1. 15 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be
        available. Sufficient weather intelligence will be available from various sources to
        conduct weather flight operations and production.
        1.7.2. WF Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate
        facilities, funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g., power,
        water, etc) are available.
        1.7.3. WF Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available (e.g., out of station
        briefings) due to WF manning, station evacuation, or other higher priority missions.
        1.7.4. WF Limitations.
             1.7.4.1. Observing Limitations. Observations taken from building 501 do not allow
             the forecaster to see the entire aerodrome, particularly southeast to southwest.
             Buildings block the view. Tower personnel assist the weather technician through the
             Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) program (see Chapter 3, para 3.4).
             1.7.4.2. Lightning. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor
             visibility. Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise. Lightning
 10                                                   DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


            detection system is accomplished using the FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 detects lightning
            within 30 NM of the airfield.
    1.8. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a building evacuation, weather
    services will move to Building 1306. The flight will continue operational support and the
    WF’s “eyes forward” responsibilities for the 15 OWS. Access to observing sensing
    equipment readouts may be lost and backup equipment use will be implemented, if needed.
        1.8.1. 1 WF members will follow duty specific SOPs and resume services at the
        alternate location as soon as possible. Most WF services/support will be able to be
        provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment dependent on communication line
        status, equipment status, etc… Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather
        products, pilot briefings, etc) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data services,
        including sensors and various data types (Metsat, radar imagery, etc). Staff services will
        also move to Building 1306. For flight safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate for
        exercises. See paragraph 11.5.1 for more details on the AOL. See Table 1.8 for contact
        information during AOL operations.

Table 7. AOL Contact Information
Type of Support                                        DSN Phone               Commercial Phone
All Weather Support                                  445-4175 / 4176          (302) 677-4175 / 4176
Fax (call via voice prior to ensure receipt)            445-4175                 (302) 677-4175
        1.8.2. AOL Observing Limitations. Observations taken from the AOL do not allow the
        forecaster to see the entire aerodrome, particularly northeast and northwest. Buildings
        block the view. Tower personnel assist the weather technician through the Cooperative
        Weather Watch (CWW) program.
    1.9. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Weather
    information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general public without approval
    from either 436 AW/PA or 436 CS/SCSD, depending upon the type of request, and
    recommendation from 436 AW/JA. Contractors employed by DoD on Dover AFB will be
    supported. Any questions/clarifications will be coordinated through the WF Flight Chief.
    1.10. Post-Mission Analysis / Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129v2, 2.3.1, units that regularly
    utilize weather support from Dover’s Weather Flight (436 OSS/OSW) should provide post-
    mission/utilization feedback, when possible. This information will be used to ensure
    products delivered to flying warfighters are accurate, relevant, and timely. This feedback
    will form a database used to gauge accuracy of support, identify trends, and improve overall
    quality of products disseminated to warfighters.
        1.10.1. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
            1.10.1.1. Completing the feedback form built into MEF briefing
            1.10.1.2. Faxing feedback form to the Dover WF
            1.10.1.3. Email and/or phone calls to the Flight Chief/NCOIC
            1.10.1.4. Face to face feedback after any briefing/mission
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                                            11


       1.10.2. The WF will, in turn, utilize this data to refine their mission support role and
       gauge unit strengths and weaknesses.
       1.10.3. Representative sample sizes are necessary to accurately reflect the satisfaction
       with and accuracy of the mission weather support being provided to Dover’s flying units
       by the WF. Feedback forms are preferred.
   1.11. Mishap Procedures. WF members and the 15 OWS have a role when the airfield is
   advised of an emergency or mishap. In general, the WF will ensure applicable data used in
   the development of any weather information, product, and/or service provided is saved for an
   investigation (to include MEFs, space weather products, mission impact slides, etc)
       1.11.1. If the WF used products from other OWS’s to support missions crossing AOR’s,
       they must coordinate with all applicable OWS’s to initiate a data save. If the OWS
       provided the flight weather MWP or other products, they will coordinate the data save
       with all AFW units involved. The WF will coordinate with Air Force Weather Agency
       (AFWA) Operations at DSN 271-3244 to save any applicable data and products not
       available locally. The WF at the departure installation and the mishap location (if on a
       military installation) will follow AFMAN 15-129V2, Chapter 3.5, Aircraft/Ground
       Mishap Data Save.
2. MISSION INFORMATION
   2.1. General. Dover has many different organizations, weapons systems, and missions. All
   systems, missions, and aircrews are limited by some weather parameters. This chapter will
   identify local weapons systems, the most common missions and operating areas, and weather
   sensitivities associated with the organization, weapons systems, missions, and aircrews.
   2.2. Supported Organization/Missions/Requirements. The WF provides weather support
   to the following organizations (and their associated units) with the accompanying missions
   and requirements:

                       requirements.

       2.2.1. Back-up Support. The WF provides back-up weather support for the 618 AOC
       (TACC) XOW Services (MWS) and Integrated Flight Management (IFM) missions
       during TACC outages
   2.3. Geographic Area of Responsibility: The 618 AOC (TACC) XOW along with the WF
   will provide mission-tailored weather support for flying areas used by assigned or attached
   units to Dover AFB. Given the wide-ranging mission of air mobility, our AOR usually
   encompasses the entire world.

     2.5. Pilot-Specific Limitations. Per AFI 11-2C-5V3, there are no pilot specific weather
     limitations for Dover’s C-5’s. Warfighters are informed of current and changing weather
     conditions via any various forms of the MEF (see Chapter 4.4).
     2.6. Mission-Specific Weather Limitations. The following provides a summary of
     Weather, Altitude and Event Minimums for C-5 and C-17 aircraft associated with Dover
     AFB. Winds of 50 knots or greater puts weather below minimums for the airfield as well.

     2.7. Training Missions, Operating Areas, and Weather Sensitivities. Due to the fact our
     mission ranges throughout the entire world, there are very few instances when weather will
     make an operating area completely unusable. Pilot discretion is used to determine mission
     go/no-go regardless of the weather phenomena listed in the MEF or briefed.
     2.8. Primary Warfighter Weather Limitations. 436 OSS/OSW gains weekly exposure to
     Dover’s primary warfighter leadership through briefings and daily weather discussions.
     Increased awareness of mission limitations is necessary for proper tailored weather support.
     The following tables provide primary organizational weather limitations:

3. AIRFIELD SERVICES
  3.1. General. Airfield services include those actions that affect the Dover aerodrome
  (defined within 5 miles of the airfield) or the base as a whole. Examples include weather
  observations, PMSV, and resource protection. Resource protection will be addressed in
  Chapter 8.
  3.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-
  111. Observations contain the following elements: observation type; date/time; winds;
  visibility; present weather; cloud groups; temperature/dew-point; altimeter setting; and
  additional remarks. There are two types of observations (described below) that are seen by
  warfighters on Dover AFB. Attachment 5 contains examples of the different types of
  observations.
     3.2.1. Points of Observation. For meteorological observations, the observing location
     is defined as the “Point of Observation.” Points of Observation are locations where the
     various elements of the observation are evaluated. Normally, these locations are confined
     to an area within 5 statute miles (8000 meters) of the runway complex. In cases where all
     measurements are taken at approximately the same point, a weather organization will be
     regarded as having a single observation location. For example, at a large, modern airfield,
     the points of observation are generally considered as follows:
         3.2.1.1. Automated Observations. The location of the primary sensor group and the
         discontinuity sensor group. The AMOS sensor groups are sited in accordance (or as
         close to as practicable) with the Federal Standard for Siting Meteorological Sensors
         at Airports. The official observation site during automated weather observing
         operations is the active runway sensors using the FMQ-19 on either RWY 01 or
         RWY 19. Physical FMQ-19 sensors do not exist for RWY 14 or RWY 32 however
         RWY 01 and RWY 19 sensors are used.
         3.2.1.2. Manual and Augmented Observations. The physical location from which
         the forecaster visually determines sky condition, present weather, and prevailing
         visibility during supplemented and/or back-up observing operations. Dover’s
         observation site is located on the large concrete walkway approximately 125 feet
         away from the north (flight line) side of building 501 (AM Ops).
            3.2.1.2.1. For elements such as prevailing visibility, present weather,
            obscurations, and all cloud height and ceiling elements, the observing location
            may be coincident with the weather observing location; or it may be the
            touchdown area of the primary runway. The selected location must provide
            consistent visually determined values.
            3.2.1.2.2. The center of the runway complex for temperature, dew point, pressure,
            lightning, and winds if the sensor is not installed at touchdown areas. If there is
            no sensing capability available on the runway complex, weather technicians may
            obtain temperature, dew point, pressure, lightning, and wind data using back-up
            methods at the observing location.
     3.2.2. METAR (Meteorological Aviation Routine Weather Report). METAR
     observations are taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the
     hour. The observation is taken from the Official Observing Site. A METAR observation
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                              17


     could also indicate that special weather criteria were met during the observing period. See
     Attachment 4 for special observing criteria. METAR observations are disseminated both
     locally and longline.
     3.2.3. SPECI (Aviation Selected Special Weather Report). SPECI is an unscheduled
     observation completed and transmitted when any of the special criteria listed in AFMAN
     15-111 and within this document (listed in Attachment 4) occur at Dover. These
     observations are disseminated both locally and longline. All SPECI reports will be
     prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria are observed. The
     time ascribed to a SPECI reflects the time, to the nearest minute, that the SPECI criteria
     are first met or observed.
     3.2.4. LOCAL (Aviation Selected Local Weather Report). A LOCAL is an
     unscheduled observation, reported to the nearest minute, not meeting SPECI criteria. The
     WF will only take single element LOCALs for altimeter setting changes. LOCALs will
     only be taken at manual weather flights and during back-up of AMOS pressure sensor.
     LOCAL altimeter setting observations are taken at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes
     when there has been a change of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the last ALSTG
     value. A METAR or SPECI taken within the established time interval will meet this
     requirement. For LOCALs taken in support of aircraft operations, the code form will be
     METAR. All LOCAL altimeter setting reports will be prepared and disseminated as soon
     as possible after the relevant altimeter setting change is observed.
  3.3. Weather Watch. Weather technicians at manual weather flights will perform one of
  two types of weather watch: a Basic Weather Watch (BWW), or a Continuous Weather
  Watch. At automated weather flights (Dover AFB), the observing system performs an
  automatic Continuous Weather Watch. When augmentation is required, weather personnel
  will perform the BWW.
     3.3.1. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). When augmenting the AMOS, a BWW is
     conducted by weather technicians who, because of other weather operations duties,
     cannot monitor the weather continuously. Due to these other weather duties, weather
     technicians on duty may not detect and report all weather changes as they occur. The
     BWW observing program has been implemented to establish the minimum requirements
     needed to ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained.
        3.3.1.1. Weather personnel conduct a BWW from the weather flight IAW AFMAN
        15-111.
        3.3.1.2. During a BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather conditions, at
        intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the
        need for a SPECI observation, when any of the following conditions are observed to
        be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
            3.3.1.2.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
            3.3.1.2.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
            3.3.1.2.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4,800 meters).
            3.3.1.2.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4,800 meters).
            3.3.1.2.5. Precipitation (any form) is observed.
18                                                   DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


             3.3.1.2.6. Thunderstorms
             3.3.1.2.7. Fog or mist
         3.3.1.3. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will
         remain alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI
         observation. Weather technicians will also monitor local area observational and
         forecast products as often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect
         their area of responsibility
     3.3.2. Continuous Weather Watch. A continuous weather watch is the process by
     which AMOS continuously weather conditions. When the AMOS is fully operational, a
     continuous weather watch is performed automatically by the sensors. There is no
     established requirement for a continuous weather watch by weather technicians when the
     AMOS is not fully operational.
  3.4. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). Weather flights responsible for preparing
  surface weather observations, without regard to the mode of operation, will establish a
  cooperative weather watch with ATC, and other appropriate base/post agencies, as required.
  Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility different from the prevailing surface
  visibility, local PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that
  could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and
  resources. All weather technicians must thoroughly understand and be able to execute every
  element in the local cooperative weather watch agreement. WF leadership will be
  responsible for ensuring CWW compliance by coordinating with associated CWW unit
  leadership.
     3.4.1. ATC Personnel. ATC directives (i.e., AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations
     Procedures and Programs; FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control) require task certified
     control tower personnel to make tower prevailing visibility observations when the
     prevailing visibility at the usual point of observation, or at the tower level, is less than 4
     miles. Control tower personnel task certified to take visibility observations are instructed
     by their agency to notify the weather flight technician when the observed tower
     prevailing visibility decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceed 4 miles (6000
     meters). In addition to visibility, tower personnel will notify weather personnel (445-
     4175/4176/Hotline) when any of the following are seen or occur on DAFB:
         3.4.1.1. Precipitation begins or ends.
         3.4.1.2. Any indication of convective activity (lightning, rain showers, or
         cumulonimbus clouds on the horizon).
         3.4.1.3. Rapid development, clearing, lowering, or rising of cloud layers.
         3.4.1.4. Any other meteorological condition that could have significant impact on the
         airfield (hail, wind damage, etc).
     3.4.2. During manual observations weather personnel will reevaluate weather conditions
     and may either take and disseminate a new observation or include reports of differing
     conditions in an official weather observation if conditions cross SPECI criteria
     (Attachment 3).
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                            19


  3.5. METWATCH. METWATCH provides an organized approach for weather personnel
  to maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation within a
  designated area(s). This process involves notifying supported units and updating any
  forecast products when pre-established weather conditions or unforecasted changes (timing,
  location, or forecast values) in weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site
  meteorological and commercial data sources (weather satellite, weather radar, websites,
  NOAA weather radio, etc.) may be used to accomplish this task. The 15 OWS will perform a
  continuous Terminal METWATCH for Dover AFB. WF personnel will act as the “eyes
  forward” for the 15 OWS by providing immediate feedback on current or short-term
  anticipated changes in weather conditions. 15 OWS will also perform Flight and Route
  METWATCH for transient flights they briefed that are departing from Dover AFB. The WF
  will perform Flight and Route METWATCH for transient flights departing Dover AFB that
  were briefed by WF personnel.
     3.5.1. Note: Though similar to MISSIONWATCH (Chap 4.5), transient missions (cross
     country, etc) are not considered “local” though the mission’s origins may have
     started/ended at Dover AFB.
  3.6. Eyes Forward Process/Procedure. This process/procedure is the WF’s role in
  allowing for the integration of weather data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning
  detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather
  picture and near-term forecast for the OWS. The WF provides meaningful meteorological
  information not contained in the coded observations to the 15 OWS as an integral part of our
  METWATCH process (phone calls, emails, etc). Additionally, the WF integrates the current
  state of the atmosphere into an understanding of future impacts on forecast conditions and
  communicates the impacts and information to the 15 OWS, as needed.
  3.7. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via Pilot-to-Metro-Service (PMSV)
  during normal duty hours on frequency 342.0 MHz. The duty forecaster will monitor PMSV
  traffic for all aircraft contacts. However, given the one-deep manning at the WF, there will
  be short periods of time (taking surface weather observations, physical requirements, etc)
  where the PMSV will not be continuously monitored. For aircraft outside the range of our
  PMSV system, the WF can provide PMSV support through a phone patch to the 436 AW
  Command Post (CP), 445-4201.
  3.8. Weather Sensors. Upon notification from ATC that a runway change has been
  completed, the WF will ensure the FMQ-19 updates the appropriate weather sensors
  (described in Chapter 10) to match the active runway.
4. MISSION SERVICES
  4.1. General. Mission services are those actions directly related to completing each
  warfighter’s daily mission(s) (e.g. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts, Flight Weather Briefings).
  The Mission Weather Products (MWP) is the primary tool used to accomplish these tasks.
  MEFs are tailored to individual warfighter requirements and may be anything from a web-
  based flight weather briefing to a change-of-command weather forecast. Dover’s primary
  MEF is completed on GDSS, however, during outages the locally developed Flight Weather
  MEF is used for our flying warfighters. Any event, both flying and non-flying, that will be
  affected by weather normally requires a MEF to meet the size, scope, and needs of the
  warfighter.
20                                                DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


     4.1.1. 618 AOC (TACC) XOW. Will provide MEFP & MEF for all Dover AFB
     missions, to include
     4.1.2. Provide 24-hour global surveillance to determine strategic, operational, and
     tactical weather threats to AMC assets
     4.1.3. Provide a continuous RED/GREEN risk management (RM) assessment of each
     618 AOC (TACC)-controlled mission
     4.1.4. Respond to airborne contacts for IFM and Mission Weather Services
     sorties/missions
  4.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). Dover AFB TAFs will be produced and
  disseminated by the 15 OWS IAW AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129v1 & v2,
  and the Data Page with the 15 OWS. Forecast specification and amendment criteria are
  listed in Attachment 4. TAFs are valid for 30 hours, apply to the area within 5-nautical miles
  (nm) of the Dover AFB airfield complex, and will be issued at 0000, 0800, and 1600 Zulu
  time, when the airfield is open. Attachment 5 contains examples of typical Dover AFB
  TAFs.
  4.3. Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP). MEFPs are essentially mission-specific
  forecasts that are developed using two primary components, administrative and operational
  process located in AFMAN 15-129v1 & v2. During this process, the WF will fuse and tailor
  products created by strategic and theater weather centers, as well as information supplied by
  local units (e.g. flying schedules) and agencies. The end result is a product/information
  designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to various warfighters
  by whatever means proves most effective. MEFs must be horizontally consistent with (but
  not necessarily mirror) products issued by AFWA and all Operational Weather Squadrons
  used to create the MEF. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when
  conditions threaten resource protection, the WF will amend the MEF to accurately reflect
  conditions and back brief the 15 OWS when time permits.
     4.3.1. Flight MEFs. Flight MEFs are the primary forecast products generated by the
     Dover WF during back-up operations. The 618 AOC (TACC) XOW at Scott AFB is the
     primary source for the Flight MEF via GDSS. The Flight MEF is a unique product
     incorporating requirements from all Dover-based flying units into a common format.
     Flight MEFs include forecast take-off weather, winds and hazards en-route, air-refueling
     route forecasts, landing weather, and aircraft specific weather elements. In addition,
     space weather products are used to predict performance of HF, UHF, and GPS systems in
     the MEF.
         4.3.1.1. C-5/C-17 Mission Execution Forecasts (MEFs). These MEFS are generated
         by the forecaster as needed. Aircrew planning products are provided for the 436 AW and
         512 AW on the web. Aircrew members receive a tailored flight MEF and receive a face-
         to-face and/or verbal briefing. Flight MEFs may also be accomplished via phone.
         Updates can be obtained by calling the forecaster at DSN 445-4175/4176 or through the
         PMSV at 342.0 MHz. Flight MEFs are developed from information provided by GDSS.
         The forecaster performs a MISSIONWATCH for mission limiting weather for Dover,
         route weather, A/R weather and planned destinations. If weather crosses any threshold
         (No-Go to Go or Go to No-Go) at any time for any mission, the mission services
         forecaster will notify the 436 AW/CP who will in turn notify the aircraft commander.
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                             21

         https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/436oss/Weather/WeatherWeb/main.htm
     4.3.2. C-5/C-17 Flight MEF:
         4.3.2.1. Take-Off/Recovery/Route weather. In addition to any current weather
         watches, warnings, and advisories, the MEF will contain the following items:
             4.3.2.1.1. Surface temperature
             4.3.2.1.2. Surface winds
             4.3.2.1.3. Cimb winds (usually C-17 only)
             4.3.2.1.4. Altimeter setting and pressure altitude.
             4.3.2.1.5. Ceiling/visibility (CIG/VIS ceilings in hundreds of feet, visibility in
             statute miles).
             4.3.2.1.6. Hazards. Describes height, level and type of icing, turbulence and
             thunderstorm.
             4.3.2.1.7. Flight level winds and temperature
             4.3.2.1.8. Minimum ceiling, max cloud tops, and min freezing level for mission
             4.3.2.1.9. Space weather impacting HF, UHF, and GPS systems. As provided by
             JAAWIN Space Weather products (see Chapter 6 for details) at
             https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/main.jsp.
     4.3.3. Updates. Flight MEFs will be updated whenever forecast weather crosses
     amendment thresholds listed in Table 2.4 and Table 2.5
     4.3.4. Follow-Up Support. Aircrews are welcome to contact 436 OSS/OSW for any
     post-mission information and/or follow-up support. Feedback information is available in
     paragraph 1.10.
     4.3.5. Transient Aircrew Weather Briefings. When time permits, weather personnel
     will provide verbal briefings, full flight MEFs, and/or updates to traditional Flight
     Weather Briefings (DD Form 175-1) to transient aircrews as requested following the
     flight’s duty priorities listed in Table 1.2. Transient briefings will be conducted at the
     weather flight, by fax, or verbally on the phone. If forecasters are unable to provide
     weather briefings due to duty priorities, refer crews to the 15 OWS briefing cell (see
     Transient Aircrew Binder in flight planning area), or the aircrew’s home station Weather
     Flight. The 15 OWS briefing cell can be reached at DSN 576-9755, or on the web at:
     https://15ows.Dover.af.mil/wx_brief/index.cfm?fuseaction=request&BW=H&UF=O
     &AOR=1&sc=175010
  4.4. MISSIONWATCH. This term is used to describe the process by which the the 618
  AOC (TACC) , MWS and WF monitor the weather for all 436 AW warfighter missions. All
  on-site meteorological and commercial data sources (weather satellite, weather radar,
  websites, etc.) may be used to accomplish this task and is the primary responsibility of the
  duty forecaster. It is through this method that MEF amendments/updates are accomplished.
  During rapidly changing weather, the supporting weather unit will amend/update the MEF as
  required and contact the 436 AW/CP to pass on critical changes.
 22                                                   DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


       4.4.1. Flight personnel will apply Risk Management principles and processes to day-to-
       day weather operations to focus activities and allocate resources of the weather unit to
       exploit environmental conditions, mitigate mission delays, and enhance the overall
       effectiveness of operations.
       4.4.2. Flight leadership will structure MISSIONWATCH processes to match basic steps
       outlined in AFMAN 15-129 v2 Table 2.6
   4.5. Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). Over 90% of the missions leaving DAFB are
   TACC controlled Integrated Flight Management (IFM) sorties/missions. As such, TACC
   Weather (15 OWS/WXM) will be the Lead Weather Unit (LWU) for all IFM
   sorties/missions. The WF will:
       4.5.1. Update takeoff weather on the IFM MEF as needed.
       4.5.2. Notify the TACC LWU (15 OWS/WXM, DSN779-0308) if the takeoff update
       includes any of the criteria listed in Table 4.1.
       4.5.3. Consult/coordinate with TACC’s LWU as required to resolve any aircrew
       concerns/issues with the IFM CMWP. Facilitate discussions between aircrew members
       and TACC’s LWU to elaborate on weather impacts and/or answer aircrew questions.
       The LWU is the final arbiter for weather issues involving IFM sorties/missions.

Table 14. Weather Criteria Requiring Notification to TACC’s LWU
Ceiling visibility less than or equal to 200ft/1/2sm (or other published airfield limitations)
Dry runway crosswind 25 kts or greater
Wet runway crosswind 20 kts or greater
Forecast LLWS for KC-10 operations
Obeserved LLWS for all AMC aircraft
Predominant thunderstorms on station
Freezing precipitation
Moderate (or greater sensitivity) turbulence/icing
Forecast or observed volcanic ash on takeoff

   4.6. Mission Weather Services (MWS). All local training missions leaving DAFB are
   MWS controlled sorties/missions. As such, TACC will be the Lead Weather Unit (LWU) for
   all local training sorties/missions. The WF will:
       4.6.1. Update takeoff weather on the GDSS MEF as needed.
       4.6.2. Consult/coordinate with TACC as required to resolve any aircrew concerns/issues
       with the GDSS-II MEF. Facilitate discussions between aircrew members and TACC to
       elaborate on weather impacts and/or answer aircrew questions. The TACC is the final
       arbiter for weather issues involving local training sorties/missions.
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                             23


5. STAFF WEATHER SERVICES
  5.1. General. Staff services are those services provided primarily by WF leadership. These
  briefings are a specialized type of MEF focused on a particular event/audience. Examples
  include, but are not limited to, staff meetings, Installation Control Center (ICC) briefings,
  and Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) and/or Flight Safety briefings.
  5.2. Operational Hours. Staff weather services will be provided Monday thru Friday from
  0730L through 1630L. When the WF has to evacuate to the Alternate Operating Location
  (AOL), services may not be available for up to 30 minutes. After normal duty hours, the WF
  personnel are on standby status. The majority of briefs are provided during normal duty
  hours. Contingency, emergency, and exercise briefings are provided as required. Given the
  one-deep manning for WF leadership, there will be times when requested staff support
  briefings cannot be provided.
  5.3. Staff Briefings. Staff weather briefings for 436 AW (Wing Stand-up) will be provided
  as required. Standard information includes animated satellite and radar imagery, a 5-day
  outlook, and slides on channel and contingency missions.
  5.4. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Limited Observation Training. ATC Limited Observing
  Training is provided by the weather flight. The ATC individual seeking training will call the
  weather flight and schedule an appointment with the WF Flight Chief/NCOIC at 445-
  4170/4174 to schedule training. After ATC personnel complete the training they will take a
  test on the information and receive a familiarization tour of the weather station.
  5.5. IRC/Flight Safety Briefings. IRC briefings are PowerPoint and CBT based
  presentations. The WF is available to conduct briefings but require at least 2-weeks prior
  coordination to schedule a weather briefer.
  5.6. ICC Briefings. The WF will provide weather briefings as required for the ICC. This
  includes real-world emergency, exercise, and deployment briefings. Each briefing will be
  tailored to provide the appropriate weather intelligence required by wing leadership.
  5.7. Climatology Briefings. Climatology information will be provided as requested.
  5.8. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
  ensuring all weather information in the FLIP is accurate. All weather related updates will be
  requested through the Airfield Operations FLIP Manager, 436 OSS/OSAA. The FLIP
  Manager will process the information to AFFSA/OL-D. Updates will fall in one of three
  categories: revisions, changes, or corrections. Items reviewed include contact numbers for
  the WF and operational weather squadron, WF hours of operation, airfield minimums, and
  the PMSV frequency and availability.
  5.9. Pre-deployment Planning Briefings. The WF will provide pre-deployment weather
  briefings when requested for deploying units. The content of the briefing will vary
  depending on the warfighter’s requirements. For example, an aviation unit will receive
  weather impacts at the deployed location on their flying mission in addition to the standard
  surface weather information usually presented to ground units. A ground based unit, like the
  security forces, will receive a briefing on surface temperatures, wind speed, potential for
  blowing sand and dust, and precipitation.
24                                                DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


6. SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES
  6.1. General. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio
  waves (High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF),
  and Satellite Communications (SATCOM)), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic
  radiation from the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space
  weather limitations, alerts and warnings, and products available to Dover AFB personnel.
  6.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
  weather. One of the biggest limitations is identifying and forecasting space weather due to a
  lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, the ability to provide
  lead-times for significant space events is extremely limited.
  6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. Dover’s missions have a wide-variety of
  parameters possibly affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF
  communication, radar, GPS Comm, etc). Broad coverage Global and CONUS-based space
  weather products (graphics) are available through the Joint Air Force and Army Weather
  Information Network (JAAWIN) https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/main.jsp.
  These products will be used to update the Space Weather portion (HF, UHF, and GPS) of the
  Flight MEF. See the link above for current Space Environment Discussions including
  potential impacts to AF operations and reporting space weather impacts.
  6.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from JAAWIN (see link
  above). Most Space Weather products from the strategic center are “now-casts” and/or very
  short-term forecasts (6-hourly periods), so the duty forecaster will check the Pilot Briefing
  Tool on the WF site for updated products whenever preparing and updating a Flight MEF.
  For more information concerning these products please contact the Air Force Weather
  Agency or the WF.
7. SPECIAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS
  7.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by
  various organizations throughout Dover AFB, and verified by the WF leadership. The
  requirements will be reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If the
  MEF, a watch, warning, or an advisory does not cover a specific local weather requirement,
  extra effort will be made (time permitting) to contact the individual unit to advise of the
  condition. In turn, the unit is responsible for contacting the WF should their requirements
  change.
  7.2. 436 AW/PA: WF provides tours of the base weather station for community groups and
  others when coordinated by PA.
  7.3. 436 AW/CP:
     7.3.1. WF provides notification of all observed warnings and advisories via JET.
     7.3.2. All watches/warnings/advisories issued by the 15 OWS will be disseminated via
     JET through the Integrated Weather Warning Capability (IWWC) system. IWWC is an
     automated notification system via telephone.
         7.3.2.1. The 15 OWS will issue all WWAs including observed warnings and/or
         advisories during such times when the WF is closed for limited duty and/or standby
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                              25


         personnel are not able to report for standby operations in time to provide the required

     termination of the training and safe removal of trainees from field conditions.
8. RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES
  8.1. General. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
  Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 15 OWS and the
  Dover WF. The 15 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecasted products including weather
  watches and warnings. The WF acts as the “eyes forward” for the 15 OWS, and is
  responsible for issuing all observed warnings and advisories during normal duty hours.
  However, the WF can issue any forecasted warning if there is an immediate threat to life
  and/or property. In these cases, the WF will back brief the 15 OWS when time permits and
  will also be responsible for dissemination to local supported agencies. Conversely, the WF
  will act as the alternate dissemination/notification source for the 15 OWS. The goal is to
  provide the best possible resource protection to Dover AFB.
     8.1.1. WF provides notification of all observed warnings and advisories via JET.
     8.1.2. The OWS will issue all WWAs including observed warnings and/or advisories
     during such times when the WF is closed for limited duty and/or standby personnel are
     not able to report for standby operations in time to provide the required lead time or
     unable to issue due to equipment-communication problems.
     8.1.3. The Dover CP will notify base agencies via phone, fax, and/or e-mail for all issued
     watches, warnings, and advisories.
  8.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to warfighters indicating
  that conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena
  (e.g. tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches are issued for a 5 nm radius of the center-point of the
  Dover runway complex. Table 8.1. contains all of the weather watches and desired lead-
  times for Dover AFB.

   8.3. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to warfighters
   alerting them that a predefined weather event, which will pose a threat to life or property, is
   expected to occur. Warnings are issued for a 5 nm radius of the center-point of the Dover
   runway complex. Forecasted warnings, with their desired lead-times, are contained in Table
   8.2.

   8.4. Observed Weather Warnings (IAW AFOSH Standards 91-66 & 91-100). Lightning
   warnings are one type of observed warning issued on Dover AFB. They extend 5 nm in all
   directions from the airfield. Lightning warnings are not issued until lightning is observed,
   either visually, via the FMQ-19 lightning sensor, or via the National Lightning Detection
   Network. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning has not occurred in the area
   for at least 15 minutes. A lightning warning will not be cancelled, however, if a
   thunderstorm is within 5 nm (as observed on radar). The WF will provide timely notification
   (see para 9.4) using the Dover AFB notification process to all supported units upon issuance
   and expiration of a lightning warning.
   8.5. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice sent to warfighters alerting
   them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may impact operations, is occurring or
   forecast to occur on Dover AFB. Weather advisories can be found in Table 8.3.
 28                                               DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012

   8.6. Format. Advisories, watches, and warnings are disseminated in a format described in
   Attachment 6. Note: The JET forms, or AF Form 3806, Weather Watch Advisory Log,
   and/or AF Form 3807, Watch/Warning Notification and Verification, will be filled out by the
   WF technician.
   8.7. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e. winds increase
   from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired
   lead-times specified above. Only one forecasted warning may be in effect at one time. If a
   warning is issued for one criteria, and it becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a
   new warning, with a new number, will be issued immediately to include all criteria expected.
   A separate valid time may be specified for each criteria, if necessary. Downgrades will
   follow the same rules outlined above with one exception – desired lead times do not apply.
   8.8. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
   change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New
   warnings and watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
   8.9. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be canceled when the weather phenomena
   are no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not canceled, they will expire at
   the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled when the criteria is no
   longer occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour. See para 8.4 for
   cancellation of observed lightning warnings.
   8.10. Toxic Corridor. Per AFI 10-2501, toxic corridor responsibility lies with the Fire
   Protection Flight with assistance from the Bio-environmental Flight. The WF will provide
   weather data necessary to calculate toxic corridors to the Fire Protection Flight and/or the
   disaster control group, as requested. The 15 OWS may supplement meteorological data to
   the appropriate Dover organizations, if requested, when the WF is unable to provide the data
   (reference AFMAN 10-2602).
   8.11. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The SWAP is in place to ensure
   sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during
   meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. For the purposes of these
   procedures, severe weather is defined as Tornados, Funnel Cloud, and/or Water Spout,
   Surface winds greater than or equal to 50 knots, Hail greater than or equal to ¾ inch in
   diameter, Freezing precipitation, Heavy snowfall (≥ 2 inches in 12 hours)
      8.11.1. It is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and
      advisories are disseminated to all Dover AFB agencies to ensure personnel and resource
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                                     29


       protection. These procedures document a two-tier system with the Dover WF and the 15
       OWS sharing responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
       8.11.2. 436 OSS WF Responsibilities. 436 OSS WF will perform the WF SWAP
       responsibilities as defined in AFMAN 15-129v2, AFI 10-229, AFMAN 10-206, 15 OWS
       Data page and this publication. More specifically, 436 OSS WF will accomplish the
       following procedures:
           8.11.2.1. Notification. The duty forecaster will notify the Severe Weather Action
           Team (SWAT) standby member(s) according to the following guidance:
               8.11.2.1.1. During normal duty hours the weather technician will implement
               SWAP by notifying the WF Flight Chief or NCOIC by phone or cell phone
               whenever one or more conditions in Table 8.4. are met. It is likely the above
               personnel will be present in the weather station and do not need to be
               recalled/activated.
           8.11.2.2. Limited Duty/Standby Recall Procedures. During nights, weekends,
           federal holidays and authorized down days, either the 15 OWS or Tower (or both)
           will notify the 436 AW/CP to recall the standby technician when weather sensor data
           is not updating and/or a severe weather watch/warning is issued and/or forecasted to
           occur within 2 hours for the following conditions in Table 8.4. items 1, 2, 7, and any
           snowfall event. Standby personnel response time is 30 minutes for recall. The
           standby forecaster will notify the WF Flight Chief and/or NCOIC by home phone or
           cell if any of the following occurs in Table 8.4. items 3 thru 6 to discuss activation of
           the SWAP.

4. The Severe Prediction Center (SPC) has Dover in a severe
                                                                        When issued
thunderstorm risk area (Slight, Moderate or High).
5. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as a
communications line failure, a critical equipment outage at either
the 15 OWS or WF, the WF will implement the SWAP at the 15
OWS’s request. The 15 OWS, as the agency ultimately responsible
for forecast watch/warning support, will have this prerogative in
the interest of Dover AFB resource protection and flight safety.
6. Any other event or situation that the duty technician deems
notification necessary
7. When requested by the 15 OWS.

               8.11.2.2.1. Activation. The WF duty technician will discuss the meteorological
               situation, manning requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place
               on standby) with the SWAT member. Given the lean manning construct within
               AMC WFs, there is usually only one person available for recall, the WF Flight
               Chief or NCOIC. At times, the WF Flight Chief will already be working the
               counter and may not have anyone readily available for recall. In this case, the WF
               Flight Chief would recall any available WF technician. If deemed necessary the
               SWAT member will report to the weather station within 30 minutes after
               notification by the duty forecaster. Once the SWAT member has arrived they will
               assist in evaluating the situation, determine the need/availability to recall
               additional personnel, and execute the SWAP duties/responsibilities in WF SOPs.
                  8.11.2.2.1.1. Upon arrival at the weather station the SWAT standby member,
                  time permitting, will conduct a METCON with the 15 OWS Forecaster/Zone
                  Supervisor.
                  8.11.2.2.1.2. Dover AFB has an automated observing system (FMQ-19).
                  Automated observations, augmented observations, and backup procedures will
                  be taken, recorded and disseminated according to AFMAN 15-111, DAFBI
                  15-101, and local procedures.
           8.11.2.3. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather occurs the following procedures
           will be executed as necessary.
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                          31

           inch, tornadoes, lightning strikes, and snow storms. Provide information detailed
           in Attachment 2 to the 436 AW/CP.
           8.11.2.3.2. If the event is to be used as one of the semi-annual SWAP tests,
           complete a memorandum for record documenting the event. Also contact 15
           OWS and provide them with the memorandum or an e-mail for their records.
           8.11.2.3.3. 436 OSS WF personnel’s home phone numbers, cell phone numbers
           and pager numbers will be reviewed monthly or when a change in personnel
           occurs to ensure the most current numbers are available for SWAP.
     8.11.3. 15 OWS Responsibilities. 15 OWS will perform the OWS SWAP
     responsibilities as defined in 15 OWS CONUS Operations Standing Operating
     Procedure, Severe Weather Action Procedures. 15 OWS will accomplish the following
     procedures when severe weather is determined likely:
        8.11.3.1. Activate the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) to include: Operations
        Floor Production supervisor, OPUP Operator, and other required individuals when
        required.
        8.11.3.2. The Operational Floor Production supervisor will evaluate
        training/experience of personnel available and move resources to provide the best
        qualified individuals are working those areas at risk.
        8.11.3.3. Unless otherwise stated, have the WF standby forecaster recalled not later
        than 2 hours before the expected occurrence of severe weather. Be prepared to
        conduct a METCON with the WF SWAT when they arrive at their base weather
        station.
        8.11.3.4. Intensify METWATCH.
        8.11.3.5. Review watch/warning criteria for Dover AFB. Issue products as required.
        8.11.3.6. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather actually occurs, accomplish the
        following:
           8.11.3.6.1. The 15 OWS SWAT leader will perform a “data save” and provide all
           pertinent information to the 436 OSS WF flight leadership.
           8.11.3.6.2. If 436 OSS WF wishes to use the event as one of the semi-annual
           SWAP tests, the 436 OSS WF leadership will provide a memorandum for record
           to the 15 OWS/WSA detailing the event.
     8.11.4. OPREP-3/Severe Weather Reporting Procedures. Following an event in
     which one of the following severe elements occurred (wind > 50 knots, hail > ¾ inch,
     tornadoes, lightning strikes, and snow storms) and/or damage was reported, provide
     information detailed in Attachment 2 to 436 AW/CP. The CP, in turn, will provide the
     WF with a copy of any weather related OPREPs. The WF will provide damage reports
     and OPREP-3s to the OWS and higher headquarters as soon as possible. Note: The 436

     AW/CC is the releasing authority for OPREP-3s. A courtesy copy to higher headquarters
     is acceptable, but not an “official” OPREP.
        8.11.4.1. Provide the 436 AW Command Post with the following information
        required for inclusion in an OPREP-3 report produced by the 436 AW commander:
        8.11.4.2. Actual severe weather experienced.
        8.11.4.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) valid at the time of occurrence.
        8.11.4.4. Any watches, warnings and/or advisories issued to include actual and
        desired lead-time.
        8.11.4.5. Operational status of meteorological equipment.
        8.11.4.6. Notify 15 OWS and AMC/A3AW of the OPREP-3 report.
        8.11.4.7. Request 15 OWS to provide required information, if needed, by performing
        a weather data save.
        8.11.4.8. 436 OSS/OSW will provide the 15 OWS severe weather reports not
        normally available through standard observations.            Reports will be passed
        immediately after fulfilling any local distribution requirement.
  8.12. Hurricane and Tropical Storm/Cyclone Support.
     8.12.1. The WF receives the National Hurricane Center (NHC) tropical cyclone
     forecasts. These forecasts are issued as military and public advisories, and include
     information describing the initial and forecast locations, movement, intensity, and
     horizontal dimensions of significant winds.
     8.12.2. Forecasts, which could change Hurricane Conditions, will be relayed to
     Command Post and/or the ICC.
     8.12.3. The WF cannot deviate from the official NHC forecast position, track, movement,
     maximum wind speed, or intensity. However, the WF can provide tailored weather forecasts
     for DAFB based on the NHC forecast. In addition, the WF will ensure that leadership
     understands that the 48-hour and 72-hour outlooks (or longer if issued) contain a high degree
     of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only, and are subject to change. This notification
     will include the forecast error probability statements included in the discussion bulletins or
     on the forecast products. The tailored forecasts for DAFB will be collaborated with the 15
     OWS in the form of a Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product that is posted to the 15
     OWS webpage when a tropical system poses a threat to the 15 OWS AOR. HURRTRAK
     software will be used as a back-up and to further tailor the NHC/15 OWS products.

         within 24 hours.
         8.12.4.6. HURCON 1E - Indicates surface winds in excess of 50 knots are occurring
         and other dangerous condition associated with the storm are present. All outside
         activity is strictly prohibited.
         8.12.4.7. HURCON 1R - Indicates life-threatening storm hazards have passed but
         damage may persist and only emergency responders and damage assessment
         personnel are released to move about.
     8.12.5. When a Tropical Cyclone initially moves within 96 hours of Dover AFB the
     combined element forecaster will inform Wing leadership via e-mail using the Tropical
     Storm E-mail/Update.
     8.12.6. When a Tropical Storm/Hurricane meets HURCON criteria, the forecaster will:
         8.12.6.1. Notify 15 OWS (DSN 576-9720) upon notification of entry into HURCON
         and any changes in HURCON levels.
         8.12.6.2. Notify the Flight Chief and/or NCOIC (if not aware already)
         8.12.6.3. Notify the Command Post
         8.12.6.4. Be prepared to participate in a conference call with TACC and other
         affected units.
         8.12.6.5. Coordinate with the 15 OWS, Flight Chief, and NCOIC if time permits
         before issuance of weather watches, warnings, and/or advisories. If this is not
         possible, issue then post-coordinate ASAP.     Also notify TACC (DSN 576-
         4794/4795/4796) of issued Weather Watches/Warnings.
     8.12.7. Forecast hurricane conditions are for Dover AFB official use only and are not for
     release to the general public.
     8.12.8. Hurricane conditions will be implemented IAW the 436 AW Full Spectrum
     Threat Response OPlan 10-2 and 436 AW Quick Reaction Checklists.
9. WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION
  9.1. General. Forecasts, observations, and weather alerts (warnings, watches, and
  advisories) are useful only if the warfighters have access to them. Timely and efficient
  dissemination of weather information is crucial to the success of the wing mission and
  resource protection. Most organizations will receive this information via our primary
  dissemination system (JET). Some organizations will receive calls via Integrated Weather
  Warning Capability (IWWC) system.
     9.1.1. In the event a WWA does not reach the intended agency, the issuing authority is
     responsible for notifying ATC and the Command and Control (C2) authority responsible
34                                              DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


     for the Installation Notification and Warning System, (per AFI 10-2501, Emergency
     Management Planning and Operations) as identified in 15 OWS-KDOV data page.
  9.2. Dissemination Systems and Back-ups.
     9.2.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET), and FMQ-19. Currently the WF uses JET
     and the FMQ-19 Operator Interface Device (OID) displays as its primary method of
     disseminating observations, forecasts, warnings, watches, and advisories. The FMQ-19
     OID displays allow for real-time monitoring of weather data and currently interface with
     the JET server through the base LAN. JET is web-based and as such, is viewable by all
     personnel who have an account and password. Agencies without JET access will receive
     critical weather information through their unit’s own dissemination system (e.g. ADS-5,
     Pyramid Alert Recall, Unit Control Center, etc). The WF will follow backup
     dissemination procedures documented in SOPs in the event that JET and/or the FMQ-19
     OIDs are inoperative.
        9.2.1.1. Airfield Automation System (AFAS) IDS-5 and FMQ-19 OID displays are
        installed in the following locations:
            9.2.1.1.1. Control Tower (IDS-5)
            9.2.1.1.2. RAPCON (IDS-5)
            9.2.1.1.3. Weather (FMQ-19 OID)
            9.2.1.1.4. Airfield Management (IDS-5)
     9.2.2. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is the primary method used for
     disseminating web-based MEFs (located on our homepage – see Chapter 4).
     Additionally, it is used as the backup system for disseminating (longline only) and
     receiving all weather information. In the event of a LAN outage, web-based MEFs will
     be faxed to requestors or may be verbally updated.
        9.2.2.1. Global Decision Support System II (GDSS-II). GDSS-II is the primary
        method used for disseminating flight weather briefings through the LAN.
     9.2.3. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between WF and other agencies for the
     sole purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in the
     event of a hotline outage. Hotlines are installed between the WF and the following
     agencies (DSN prefix 445, commercial prefix 677):
        9.2.3.1. 436 AW Command Post 445-4201
        9.2.3.2. Tower 445-3020
        9.2.3.3. RAPCON 445-3267
        9.2.3.4. Airfield Management 445-4192
     9.2.4. Climatic Data Requests. Upon request from an authorized agency (as deemed
     appropriate by wing leadership and 436 AW/PA), provide climatology data for Dover
     AFB and other locations. Requests may be made by phone, e-mail, letter, or in person.
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                               35


  9.3. Dissemination and Backup Procedures.
     9.3.1. TAFs. TAFs will be entered and disseminated through JET as described in
     Chapter 4. If JET is out of service then the WF will disseminate the information locally
     via standard telephone lines to tower, RAPCON, and command post.
     9.3.2. Observation Procedure. Observations will be taken and disseminated through
     the JET as described in Chapter 3.
        9.3.2.1. Local Dissemination. When JET is out of service, observations will be
        disseminated by the WF locally first to positions that control air traffic (noted on a
        local dissemination log), in the following priority:
            9.3.2.1.1. Tower (Hotline)
            9.3.2.1.2. RAPCON (Hotline)
            9.3.2.1.3. The 436 AW Command Post (Hotline) (See paragraph 9.2.3 for a list of
            hotlines and associated phone numbers)
            9.3.2.1.4. Airfield Management (same building as the WF; pass verbally or
            Hotline)
            9.3.2.1.5. 15 OWS
        9.3.2.2. Long-line Dissemination. Observations will be disseminated long-line
        through the Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN). If
        all long-line transmission resources are out of service, call via telephone (voice relay)
        to any other weather station or supporting hub (15 OWS) for long-line transmission.
     9.3.3. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. Weather watches, warnings, and
     advisories will be disseminated via JET and the Integrated Weather Warning Capability
     (IWWC) system. The 15 OWS uses IWWC as their primary dissemination system and is
     an automated notification system via telephone using a pre-recorded voice message.
        9.3.3.1. OWS issued watches, warnings, and advisories will be given to the 436
        AW/CP for dissemination (see Chapter 8).
        9.3.3.2. If JET is out of service, the OWS and/or WF will call the 436 AW/CP to
        pass information.
        9.3.3.3. Tornado Warnings. The 436 AW/CP has the primary responsibility for
        sounding the base siren in the event of a tornado warning issuance.
        9.3.3.4. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated to the base
        populace via e-mail, AtHoc , Desktop Alert (pop up window on all computers), and
        the Giant Voice system IAW 436 AW Basic Unit Supplement, Annex A, allowing all
        members on base to be prepared for inclement weather.
  9.4. Base Warning Notification Procedures. The 436 AW Basic Unit Supplement, Annex
  A, details the distribution and notification processes for the 436 AW. Dover AFB uses
  AtHoc Desktop Alert (pop up window on all computers on the LAN), e-mail, and the Giant
  Voice system as the distribution and notification systems.
     9.4.1. WF provides notification of all observed warnings and advisories via JET.
36                                             DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


     9.4.2. The OWS provides notification of all forecast warnings and advisories via IWWC.
     9.4.3. The OWS will issue all WWAs including observed warnings and/or advisories
     during such times when the WF is closed for limited duty and/or standby personnel are
     not able to report for standby operations in time to provide the required lead time or
     unable to issue due to equipment-communication problems.
     9.4.4. The Dover CP will notify the following base agencies via phone, fax, and/or e-
     mail for all issued watches, warnings, and advisories (exceptions as noted):
        9.4.4.1. Tower
        9.4.4.2. RAPCON
        9.4.4.3. MOC
        9.4.4.4. Airfield Management

10. WEATHER EQUIPMENT
   10.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
   communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on
   backup systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
   10.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses the FMQ-19, Automated Observing
   System, as the primary system to determine the current state of the atmosphere. This critical
   system is used continuously to provide warfighters the most timely, accurate and relevant
   weather intelligence possible. The combined element forecaster will augment/backup the
   FMQ-19 IAW AFMAN 15-111 and local procedures. The following is a list of the
   meteorological sensors used by the WF:
      10.2.1. FMQ-19. The following is a breakdown of the sensors on the FMQ-19:
          10.2.1.1. Temperature and Relative Humidity. This instrument provides the
          current temperature and dew point. The Kestrel 4500 and TMQ-53 Tactical
          Meteorological Observing System (TMOS) are our backups.
          10.2.1.2. Wind Monitor. This instrument provides wind direction, wind speed and
          gusts, and variability. There is a sensor on each end of runway 01/19 to provide
          launching/recovering aircraft the most accurate information as possible. The TMQ-
          53 and Kestrel 4500 are used as backups.
          10.2.1.3. Visibility. This sensor determines the runway visual range (RVR) for
          Dover AFB runway 01/19. Sensors are located at the touchdown, midfield, and roll
          out points on the runway. Additionally, this sensor determines the prevailing
          visibility on the airfield. There is no backup capability to the RVR portion of this
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                               39


        system. The TMQ-53 is the backup for the prevailing visibility as well as tower and
        weather technicians.
        10.2.1.4. Cloud Height. Commonly referred to as the LBC (Laser Beam
        Ceilometer), this instrument uses a laser beam to detect the base of clouds near the
        airfield up to and including 25,000 ft AGL. The TMQ-53 is used as the backup.
        10.2.1.5. Barometer. These sensors measure (three total) the current altimeter
        setting and barometric pressure. The TMQ-53 and Kestrel 4500 serve as backups for
        this system.
        10.2.1.6. Lightning Detection. This sensor can detect cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-
        ground lightning strikes out to 30 miles. The OWS website, JAAWIN website,
        WeatherTAP website, and TMQ-53 are our backup means of receiving lightning data.
        10.2.1.7. Freezing Rain. This sensor detects the presence of freezing rain or drizzle.
        Weather technicians are the backup.
        10.2.1.8. Present Weather. This sensor has the capability of detecting a wide
        variety of precipitation types to include rain, drizzle, snow, etc. However, it is not
        capable of detecting ice pellets or hail. The combined element forecaster will use
        augmentation/backup procedures to report these. The TMQ-53, which has the same
        limitations, will be used as the backup.
        10.2.1.9. Rain Gauge. The sensor automatically measures the amount of
        precipitation that has fallen.        During periods of showery/cumuliform type
        precipitation, it may be raining at the official observation point and not at the weather
        technician's location. This can result in conflicts in what the FMQ-19 reports and
        what is observed by the weather technician. The TMQ-53 may be used as the
        backup.
     10.2.2. NEXRAD. The WSR-88D (Doppler Radar) Open Principal User Processor
     (OPUP) is our primary weather radar. The physical location of the WSR-88D is
     approximately 19NM to the south of Dover AFB and is controlled by the National
     Weather Service in Wakefield. The OWS website, commercial weather service
     “WeatherTAP”, and the NWS homepage provides our backup sources of radar
     information.
  10.3. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment,
  communications equipment allows the WF to get the right information to the right
  warfighter. The following systems are the backbone of the WF communications network.
     10.3.1. JET. As discussed in Chapter 9, this is our primary system for disseminating
     forecasts, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a
     backup for key aircraft controlling agencies.
     10.3.2. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (342.0 MHz) allows the WF
     to communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel.
     If the PMSV is out of service aircrews can contact the Dover AFB Command Post (DSN
     445-4201/Comm 302-677-4201), WF (DSN 445-4175/4176 or Comm 302-677-
     4175/4176), 15 OWS via phone patch (DSN 576-9720/Comm 618-256-9720), or the
     following locations:
 40                                                DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


Table 19. Alternate PMSV Locations
 Base                         PMSV Frequency         Base                  PMSV Frequency
 Andrews AFB, MD              344.6                  Norfolk NAS, VA       271.6
 McGuire AFB, NJ              239.8                  Langley AFB, VA       239.8

        10.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as backup system as well
        as for passing along critical, time-sensitive information rapidly.
        10.3.4. LAN. The WF relies heavily on the local area network to improve the timeliness
        and accuracy of weather intelligence to our warfighters. Much information can be
        obtained through other methods but is far less efficient.
   10.4. Maintenance. All equipment requires some sort of maintenance from time to time.
   The following organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair weather and
   communications equipment:

   10.5. Restoring Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems have been established in
   the event natural disasters, or any other anomaly, simultaneously impact systems base-wide.
   Significant indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative while
   minimal means the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment
   are listed below (priorities may be adjusted based on incoming weather):

Table 21. Equipment Restoral Priorities
                                                                  Response Times

DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                            41


  10.6. Building Power. Bldg 501 is equipped with a back-up generator. The generator
  should start up automatically when power is cut-off. CE performs quarterly tests to ensure
  the generator is working properly.
11. OWS/WF BACK-UP SUPPORT
  11.1. 15 OWS Outages. The 15 OWS is heavily dependent upon communication and
  communication equipment; therefore, the 15 OWS is susceptible to a multitude of system
  outages that could cause a wide range of changes in mission capability. The 15 OWS has
  established back-up procedures that are flexible and designed to meet the requirements
  identified in AFMAN 15-129v1 & v2.
  11.2. Three-Tier Back-Up Support. IAW AFI 15-128 the 15 OWS will back-up the
  following products and services in prioritized order: Tier 1. Wartime, Contingencies,
  Military Operations Other Than War and Force Protection; Tier 2. Peacetime and Exercise
  Operations; and Tier 3. Mission Planning, Products and Services.
     11.2.1. Minimum Planned Actions for Each Tier. (All Tiers 1-3) The 15 OWS will
     ensure contact with all WFs, primarily via telephone. The 15 OWS will hand off TAF,
     WW/WA and Flight Weather Briefing responsibilities (including transient aircrews at
     that location) to supported WFs. However, the 15 OWS forecasters will maintain close
     coordination with WFs via telephone, when feasible and when weather information is
     available, to aid in TAF METWATCH, WW/WA and Flight Weather Briefing support.
     For outages less than 72 hours, AFWA will temporarily assume the responsibility of
     NECONUS Warning Cell support. For outages greater than 72 hours, the 15 OWS will
     deploy personnel to AFWA to begin limited operations/support to include FITL graphics
     products, lead forecaster analyses/bulletins, DD Form 175-1 flight weather briefings and
     assume NECONUS Warning Cell support.
  11.3. Alternate Sources of Weather Information. The 15 OWS has established a back up
  support agreement with all 1 WXG CONUS OWSs. Additionally, supported units may
  access JAAWIN or the National Weather Service websites for weather products. For outages
  greater than 72 hours, the 15 OWS will deploy personnel to a designated 1 WXG location to
  begin limited operations/support to include FITL graphics products, Senior Duty Officer
  forecast analyses/bulletins, DD Form 175-1 flight weather briefings and assume NE CONUS
  Points locations support.
  11.4. Contact with WFs. When the 15 OWS implements back-up procedures due to
  mission capability loss/degradation, it will contact each WFs primary 24-hour POC or
  alternate if necessary and provide a brief description of the problem(s) and impacts. The 15
  OWS will also notify WFs when mission capability is restored.
  11.5. Outages at Dover WF. When an outage in weather operations occurs at Dover AFB,
  the WF will notify the 15 OWS. The WF will request backup support as needed to meet
  mission requirements.
     11.5.1. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). The WF will notify the 15 OWS in case of
     relocation to the AOL and again immediately upon arrival at the AOL. The WF will also
     identify any changes to the weather warning and advisory dissemination procedures. The
     WF AOL is located in Building 1306 on Dover AFB. The AOL phone number is DSN
     445-4175/4176 and fax is DSN 445-4175.
42                                                DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012


         11.5.1.1. Operational Impacts at AOL. Once the WF moves to the AOL, there are
         some restrictions to visibility for continuing “eyes forward” support.
         11.5.1.2. If electrical power/communications are still available at the primary
         location, weather sensor information will still be accessible via JET using the
         Automated Observation System (AOS) software interface or through the 15 OWS
         website.
         11.5.1.3. If electrical power/communications are impacted/disrupted at the primary
         location, observations will be estimated using a Kestral 4500 or TMQ-53 if the AOL
         is used for an extended period of time.
         11.5.1.4. The WF will have access to both JET (if electrical power/communications
         are still available at the primary location) and LAN at the AOL, allowing the WF to
         issue any required WWAs. Radar access will be available via the internet. The AOL
         does not have any dedicated Hotlines to any agency. This is due to the telephone
         infrastructure in Building 1306.
         11.5.1.5. PMSV support will be limited to phone patches through Command Post.
12. RECIPROCAL SUPPORT
  12.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by
  various organizations throughout Dover AFB, and verified by the WF leadership. The
  requirements will be reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If the
  MEF, a watch, warning, or an advisory does not cover a specific local weather requirement,
  extra effort will be made (time permitting) to contact the individual unit to advise of the
  condition. In turn, the unit is responsible for contacting the WF should their requirements
  change.

Figure A5.1. Example Observation




   A5.1.1. Station identifier – also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
   observation (in this case Dover AFB).
   A5.1.2. Type of observation. There are three types of observations as described below:
          A5.1.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). An observation taken each
          hour, between H+55 and H+59.
          A5.1.2.2. Special Observation (SPECI). An observation taken as a result of one of the
          special criteria (listed in attachment 3) being met.
   A5.1.3. Time. This is the time, in Zulu, or GMT, that the last element of the observation
   was observed.
   A5.1.4. Wind. This portion of the observation provides the wind direction (first 3 numbers,
   VRB for variable, or 000 for calm), sustained wind speed (next 2 or 3 numbers), and wind
   gusts (any numbers following the G, if there have been any) measured in knots. One knot
   equals 1.14 miles per hour.
   A5.1.5. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) that
   can be seen from the airfield, reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported
   is 7 miles.
   A5.1.6. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon that is occurring on the airfield. This is
   mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. The table below lists the present
   weather codes.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD                                                     DD MMM YYYY
TO: 436 AW/CP, 15 OWS B-flight, 436 OSS/OSA, OSAT, OSAR, OSAA
FROM: 436 OSS/OSW (Flight Chief)
SUBJECT: Weather Limited Duty Operations
1. The Dover Weather Flight has reduced hours of operation. On normal duty days the hours of
operation are 0600L to 1800L. In addition, weather is still closed on weekends and holidays.
Please see recall criteria in paragraph 2 and standby times and technicians in paragraph 3.
2. 436 OSS/OSW duty technicians may be released only after coordination with the 15 OWS
forecaster & senior duty officer, Tower, RAPCON, and Command Post. The weather technician
must remain on-duty for any severe weather conditions within 10 miles of Dover AFB and until
conditions are no longer expected to impact Dover AFB or until the standby technician arrives to
relieve them. Severe weather conditions are defined as those criteria requiring the weather
flight to activate the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT). Standby personnel response time
is 30 minutes for recall. Standby personnel will be recalled by the 15 OWS and 436 AW/CP
in the event any of the following occurs:
   A. Severe Weather: Either the 15 OWS or Tower (or both) will notify the 436 Command
       Post to recall the standby technician when a severe weather watch/warning is issued
       and/or forecasted to occur within 2 hours for the following:
                                   Tornado
                                   Winds > 50 knots
                                   Hail > 3/4 inch diameter
                                   Freezing precipitation
                                   Any snowfall
   B. Equipment/communication outages or significant degradation Either the 15 OWS,
       Tower, or RAPCON notify Command Post to recall the standby technician when any of
       the following occur:
       1) If the automated observation sensors are not viewable to ATC or 15 OWS personnel
           (total communications outage)
       2) If the observations are not being transmitted to ATC or 15 OWS (JET outage –
           minimum 1 observation per hour)
DOVERAFBI15-101 4 DECEMBER 2012                                                                  65


       3) If, in the opinion of ATC and/or 15 OWS personnel, the observations are not
           representative of conditions at the airfield or in the local area. These conditions
           must have a direct/significant impact to operations if not corrected:
           a. Weather sensors are working properly if a dollar sign ($) is not included in the
               remarks a the end of the observation.
           b. Recall standby weather personnel if thunderstorm(s) are occurring (thunder is
               heard) and the sensor is not reporting thunderstorm(s).
           c. Weather sensors may take an average of 10-15 minutes to "catch up" depending
               on the weather element. (Winds, visibility, and cloud heights are averaged)
   C. Operationally significant events (Command Post recall):
       - ICC recall
       - Aircraft Mishap
       - Alert Missions
   D. Weather Observation Links (Viewable from a .mil domain)
       1) Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET): (Once account is requested and set-up)
