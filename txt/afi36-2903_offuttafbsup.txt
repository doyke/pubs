                                Chapter 7 (Added)
                 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PSEUDOFOLLICULITIS
                         BARBAE CLINIC (OFFUTT AFB)

7.1. (Added) Definitions

    7.1.1. (Added) Pseudofolliculitis Barbae (PFB) is a common skin disorder. It is an
    inflammation of the skin in the hair-bearing areas of the face and neck. The condition is
    caused by closely trimmed hair reentering the skin rather than growing outward. There is no
    cure for this disease, but proper beard care and correct shaving techniques can control it.

7.2. (Added) Air Force Standards: “Beards must not be worn by Air Force personnel except
when authorized by a commander on the advice of a medical officer for health reasons. All
medically recommended facial hair will be kept trimmed so as not to exceed ¼ inch in length,
and it is the commander’s responsibility to monitor a person’s progress in treatment in order to
control this authority” (see AFI 36-2903). In order for an individual with PFB to obtain a waiver
he must be identified as having a problem, be referred to the shaving clinic by his Primary Care
Manager (PCM), enrolled in the shaving clinic and have a medical recommendation for a waiver.
Individuals who have a waiver from a previous base must also have a referral from their PCM to
be seen in the shaving clinic.

7.3. (Added) Responsibilities Of Parties Involved

    7.3.1. (Added) Squadron Commander. AFI 36-2903, Dress And Personal Appearance of
    Air Force Personnel, as amended, requires that the unit commander evaluate and review
    each case in which the medical facility has recommended a shaving waiver. The squadron
    commander must concur or not concur with the recommendation and state whether the
    waiver is or is not granted. The commander then signs OAFB Form 183, Stubble Growth
    Control card. If the squadron commander does not concur with the recommendation, the
    squadron commander should first consult with the medical officer whose signature
    appears on the OAFB Form 183, Stubble Growth Control, (attachment 1). If the
    squadron commander and physician cannot resolve the disagreement, the physician
    should immediately elevate the problem through the medical chain of command.

    7.3.2. (Added) Dermatologist. Manages and controls the shaving clinic. The
    dermatologist will sign all OAFB Form 183, Stubble Growth Control and evaluate any
    patient who is not responding to therapy or who develops complications as a result of
    therapy. The dermatologist will treat all patients with an acute exacerbation of PFB, and
    if necessary designate an alternate physician to issue OAFB Form 183, Stubble Growth
    Control s and monitor the clinic in his/her absence.
AFI36-2903_OFFUTTAFBSUP2, 4 SEPTEMBER 2006                                            3

    7.3.3. (Added) PFB Technician. The PFB technician will evaluate, monitor and instruct
    patients in the proper way to shave by the method best for him. The medical technician
    refers patients with specialized treatment requirements to the dermatologist. The
    technician prepares the OAFB Form 183, Stubble Growth Control for the physician’s
    signature and makes accurate entries in the patient’s medical record. The technician will
    maintain a log of all shaving waivers issued. The technician will ensure that each patient
    receives a copy of this instruction on his initial visit.

    7.3.4. (Added) Patient. The patient is the key to the success of the program. The patient
    has the    responsibility to comply with medical recommendations for treatment and
    maintenance of grooming standards. Patients on flying status or the Personnel Reliability
    Program must bring their records to their scheduled appointment. The patient must
    acquire all signatures and carry the OAFB Form 183, Stubble Growth Control at all
    times. The patient must obtain follow-up coordination through the Dermatology Clinic
    before shaving waiver expires and schedule a follow-up appointment when PFB flares.
    The patient is advised the responsibility for the treatment is his.

7.4. (Added) Hours Of Operation. The Clinic is open Monday through Friday 0730-1630;
however, appointments must be made through the clinic staff by calling 232-CARE, select
specialty clinic, and then Dermatology. Renewals of shaving waivers are done on a walk-in
basis during these hours.

7.5. (Added) Guidelines. The Pseudofolliculitis Barbae Clinic (PFB)/Shaving Clinic is a one
phase program.

    7.5.1. (Added) All visits to the PFB clinic are of utmost importance to ensure patient
    compliance with the program.

    7.5.2. (Added) The patient will follow all previous instructions by scheduling follow-up
    appointments when PFB flares and coordinating shaving waiver renewal before the waiver
    expires.

    7.5.3. (Added) Shaving waiver renewals are on a walk-in basis, therefore they may have to
    wait if a technician is with a scheduled appointment. To possibly ease the wait time patients
    may call ahead to inform the technician that their waiver is due to expire and that they will
    be coming in.

    7.5.4. (Added) If the patient is to be on leave, TDY, or deployed it is the responsibility of
    the patient to ensure the waiver will not expire while he is gone.

    7.5.5. (Added) Patients are reminded that follow-up care is mandatory, regardless if it is
    scheduled or a shaving waiver renewal. If the individual fails to cancel the scheduled
    appointment, a No Show letter may be sent to the individual's First Sergeant.

    7.5.6. (Added) If the waiver has been expired greater then 30 days, the patient will need to
    be reevaluated by the Dermatologist.

    7.5.7. (Added) Patients are instructed to follow their individual regimen even while on
    leave.

7.6. (Added) Face Care Tips: Everyone will follow these steps daily.
     a. Wash face with a Buf Puf pad against the grain twice a day.
     b. Place a hot towel on face once a day for a few minutes.
     c. Release ingrown hairs without plucking them.
     d. Shave same time of day.
     e. Do not use deodorant soaps (use Dove, Tone or Pernox).
     f. Apply moisturizing cream twice a day.

7.7. (Added) Types Of Shaving Methods.

    7.7.1. (Added) The Electric Clippers:

          7.7.1.1. (Added) Follow face care tips. (7. a-c)

          7.7.1.2. (Added) Hold clippers horizontally.

          7.7.1.3. (Added) Start by shaving the sideburns downwards.

          7.7.1.4. (Added) Shave other areas upward with strokes overlapping one another
          slightly.

          7.7.1.5. (Added) Do not press down hard against the skin or irritation could result.

          7.7.1.6. (Added) Do not stretch the skin. Stretching causes the hair to protrude
          outward. Upon skin relaxation, the hair retracts below the surface.

          7.7.1.7. (Added) Wash face to remove any loose hair.

          7.7.1.8. (Added) Apply moisturizing lotion.

    7.7.2. (Added) The Electric Razor:

          7.7.2.2. (Added) Start by shaving the sideburns downward in an overlapping circular
          motion.

          7.7.2.3. (Added) Do not press down hard against the face or irritation could result.
AFI36-2903_OFFUTTAFBSUP2, 4 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                  5

       7.7.2.4. (Added) Shave other areas in same overlapping circular motion.

       7.7.2.5. (Added) Wash face to remove any loose hair.

       7.7.2.6. (Added) Apply moisturizing lotion.

    7.7.3. (Added) The Adjustable/Disposable Razor:

       7.7.3.1. (Added) Follow face care tips (7. a-c)

       7.7.3.2. (Added) Apply shaving foam/gel thickly.

       7.7.3.3. (Added) Set adjustable razor to setting 3 or 4.

       7.7.3.4. (Added) Hold razor firmly and make smooth strokes using a wrist type motion,
       1-1/2” to 2” in length. Avoid jerky and sloppy strokes.

       7.7.3.5. (Added) Do not stretch skin. Stretching causes the hair to protrude outward.
       Upon skin relaxation, the hair retracts below the surface.

       7.7.3.6. (Added) When shaving with a blade, make sure all strokes lead into the shaving
       foam/gel.

       7.7.3.7. (Added) Check for missed paths of hair, especially in the corners of the mouth,
       chin, jaw and neck. These are the most common areas of PFB.

       7.7.3.8. (Added) Wash face to remove loose hair and shaving foam/gel.

       7.7.3.9. (Added) Apply moisturizing lotion.

7.8. (Added) Manual Release Of Ingrown Hair. This process is accomplished with a surgical
needle or tweezers. The hairs are lifted from the skin line or the shaving bumps to allow them to
grow out and away from the skin. Some bumps may need to be opened for the same purpose.
When releasing hairs at home, use a needle or tweezers and lift the hair from the skin surface. Do
not pull hairs out of face. This may result in hairs growing under the surface of the skin, which
will aggravate the problem. Manual release of the embedded hair can sometimes be difficult and
will require both practice and persistence.
