     software entitlements and implementation information.
        9.10.1. Installations are to utilize AutoDiscovery Tools to acquire implemented software
        information that is to be reported by the ITASM system. Installations are to utilize CITS
        ITASM standard tools where applicable. AutoDiscovery Tools will suffice for audit on
        implemented software on network attached computers and servers.
            9.10.1.1. (Added-AFDW) The 844 CG will assist units in the annual software audit
            and management process through periodic SAVs, SLM training, and by providing
            tools to assist in these efforts.
        9.10.2. Installations utilization of ITASM will complement the AFCA CITS ITASM
        deployment schedule.
10. Software Developed Using Commercial Off-The-Shelf Office SoftwareTools. Air Force
computer users are encouraged and expected to use their licensed COTS office software to
increase their individual professional productivity and overall unit effectiveness. Users must
coordinate networked or “group” computer applications that are user built with these tools with
the installation CSO. This precludes later impact on network and server capacity, avoids
duplication of effort on similar application software within the installation or MAJCOM, and
ensures continued software support after departure of one or more of the original user-
developers. Air Force user-developers shall:
     10.1. Ensure the Air Force retains property rights to the computer software developed in the
     course of their duties.
     10.2. Not by-pass computer/network server operating systems, security systems, or access
     controls provided by higher authority.
     10.3. Provide the CSO a software documentation package in appropriate digital format. The
     software package must include:
        10.3.1. The author or point of contact, organization, and telephone number.
        10.3.2. A descriptive unclassified title with version number as the first delivery (use
        Version 1.0).
        10.3.3. A brief (one paragraph) unclassified description of the software’s functionality
        for use in publishing software reuse catalogs; and a classified description, if necessary, to
        more fully explain the software’s capabilities.
AFI33-114_AFDWSUP_I 11 MARCH 2011                                                                  9


       10.3.4. A brief description of all testing (such as Year 2000) performed on the mission
       application software and its databases.
       10.3.5. A brief user’s guide. The user’s guide should include:
          10.3.5.1. The hardware configuration required.
          10.3.5.2. The supporting software required to include the operating system and (if
          any) supporting COTS software with version release number.
          10.3.5.3. Compiling and linking instructions, if applicable.
          10.3.5.4. Descriptions of the software installation process, required hardware setup,
          menus, and software capabilities and functions.
          10.3.5.5. Samples of terminal output screens and print products produced (if any).
          10.3.5.6. Other information useful for continued effective use and maintenance of the
          mission application software.
11. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Software
Development; Reuse; and Release. Adhere to DoDD 3405.1; DoDD 4630.5, Compatibility,
Interoperability, and Integration of Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I)
Systems, November 12, 1992; DoD Instruction (DoDI) 4630.8, Procedures for Compatibility,
Interoperability, and Integration of Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I)
Systems, November 18, 1992; and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6212.01A,
Compatibility, Interoperability, and Integration of Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, and Intelligence Systems, 30 June 1995; when developing mission or application
software for C4I systems.
   11.1. Organic Development. Do not develop software organically unless quality, cost,
   performance, schedule, or interoperability requirements cannot be met with COTS or non-
   developmental item software.
       11.1.1. Acquire an approved mission needs statement before developing organic
       software requiring over 6 man-months of effort or costing in excess of $50,000, and
       follow guidance for software acquired under DoD 5000-series acquisitions.
       11.1.2. All units that develop or maintain software will have a software process
       improvement (SPI) program and a documented SPI plan, including at least:
          11.1.2.1. A baseline of their current capabilities.
          11.1.2.2. Goals and milestones they intend to reach.
          11.1.2.3. Metrics to measure their progress toward their goals and milestones.
          11.1.2.4. Timeline for SPI appraisals. The Software Technology Support Center
          (STSC) at Hill Air Force Base UT is available on a fee-recovery basis for SPI
          appraisals, but any qualified SPI appraiser may be used.
          11.1.2.5. Identify life-cycle support requirements for the life of developed software.
   11.2. Releasing COTS Office Software Tools. It is Air Force policy to release, upon
   consideration of a valid written request, specific software developed exclusively with
   government funds or otherwise owned by the Air Force. The OPR for the software decides to
 10                                                AFI33-114_AFDWSUP_I 11 MARCH 2011


   release or disclose that software. The approval authority may be at a higher level depending
   upon the recipient (e.g., approval authority for all foreign release requests is Secretary of the
   Air Force [SAF/IADD]). When not for foreign release and the OPR is in doubt regarding the
   release of software, send the request to HQ USAF/SCX, 1250 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1250, for resolution. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
   must be sent to the local FOIA manager to control and respond using guidelines in the Air
   Force supplement to DoD 5400.7-R (DoD 5400.7-R/AFSUP), DoD Freedom Of Information
   Act Program, 22 July 1999. Before releasing the software, the OPR shall require the
   requester to sign a memorandum of agreement (see Attachment 2). Releases of Air Force-
   owned or developed software from software reuse libraries, or software under Air Force-
   industry Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), are exceptions to
   this policy.
   11.3. When developing mission or application software for information systems, it is
   desirable to utilize that Software Engineering Institute’s Software Capability Maturity Model
   Integrated (CMMI) as advocated by the Software Technology Support Center (STSC) at Hill
   AFB UT (www.stsc.hill.af.mil), or the 754th Electronic Systems Group’s Systems
   Engineering Process (www.gunter.af.mil/sw).
12. Software Configuration, Change, and Release Management. Use ISO/IEC 20000, or
ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), Configuration Management, Change
Management, and Release Management processes to plan, identify, control, monitor, verify, and
manage software configuration items. Typically, software configuration items would include
information such as purchase order number, purchase date, software manufacturer, software title,
and version implemented.
13. Information Assurance. Program managers and software developers must integrate
information assurance into their systems using guidance contained in AFPD 33-2, Information
Protection (converting to Information Assurance), and the Air Force 33-200 series publications.
These publications give policy guidelines for developing and using the computer,
communications, and emissions security programs needed for all Air Force communications and
information systems.
14. Open Systems Guidelines. The Air Force is committed to meeting the DoD objective of
developing interoperable and maintainable systems based on open standards. To that end, system
developers, contract administrators, and maintainers must adhere to the guidance given in the
DoD Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) and JTA-Air Force (JTA-AF). These documents
identify a common set of mandatory information technology standards and guidelines used in all
new systems and system upgrades in the DoD. Each unit ensures that upgrades to systems under
maintenance comply to the maximum extent possible with the JTA and JTA-AF.
15. Software Reuse. Software reuse is the practice of using existing software components to
develop new software applications. Software reuse benefits the Air Force through increased
developer productivity, improved quality and reliability of software-intensive systems, enhanced
system interoperability, lowered program technical risk, and shortened software development
and maintenance time.
   15.1. Reusable software components may include executable software binaries, source code
   segments, program documentation, project plans, requirement descriptions, design and
   architecture documents, database schemas, test data and test plans, user’s manuals, software
AFI33-114_AFDWSUP_I 11 MARCH 2011                                                                 11


   tools, and object classes. These assets can be most efficiently used when designed and
   packaged to fit into a product-line architecture at each software development location for a
   specific mission area or functional domain, using interface standards and common
   communications protocols. The domain product-line components can then be used to create
   families of related systems designed to share common software architecture for the domain.
   15.2. Each Air Force software development location should:
       15.2.1. Establish a software reuse library or repository for internal sharing of the
       reusable software components developed at the location.
       15.2.2. Report each reusable software component to the Air Force Reuse Center,
       Standard Systems Group, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL, for storage in the Air Force
       Defense Software Repository System.
       15.2.3. Upon valid written request, release software component using the software
       release memorandum of agreement at Attachment 2.
16. Deleted.
17. Bandwidth. The Air Force is faced with restrictions on the amount of information that can
be provided to our forces, particularly in remote areas of the world. Therefore, software systems
designers and developers must discipline themselves in the quantity and content of non-mission
essential information sent over supporting network infrastructures (that is, ensure sending only
operationally necessary data). In addition to DoD direction, follow all policy and procedures in
AFIs 33-101, Communications and Information Management Guidance and Responsibilities; 33-
115V1; 33-119, Electronic Mail (E-Mail) Management and Use; and 33-129, Transmission of
Information Via the Internet; on downloading from the Internet, transmission of e-mail
attachments, video teleconferencing, Web browsing, and conservation measures during periods
of surge or network degradation. Air Force-developed software (including that developed
specifically for the Air Force) will accommodate network infrastructure considerations into its
systems design and internal code, such that it does not overtax the infrastructure that it relies and
operates.
18. Checklists. Use AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist (available electronically), to
develop a checklist on software and software license management using paragraphs 3 through 8

                                  RELEASE OF SOFTWARE

A2.1. Software Reuse. It is HQ USAF policy to consider releasing specific software upon
receiving a valid written request.
   A2.1.1. Software is available from the Central Archive for Reusable Defense Software, the
   Defense Software Repository System, or the Air Force Defense Software Repository System.
   In such releases, the memorandum of agreement at paragraph A2.3 need not be completed.
   A2.1.2. As government furnished property software is available under the provisions of an
   acquisition contract. NOTE: When the government has unlimited rights in computer software
   in the possession of a contractor, the government will not pay for the use of such software in
   performance of government contracts or for the later delivery to the government of such
   computer software, provided that the contractor be entitled to compensation for converting
   the software into the prescribed form for reproduction and delivery to the government. In
   addition to adhering to the specific contract's provisions, the contractor also must sign the
   memorandum of agreement at paragraph A2.3.
   A2.1.3. Software is also available to organizations with which the Air Force does not have a
   contractual arrangement. In such situations, the recipient must sign the memorandum of
   agreement at paragraph A2.3.
A2.2. Software Release or Disclosure. Each OPR bases the decision to release or disclose
software on review of all significant factors including but not limited to, national security,
militarily critical technology/dual use, royalty arrangements, potential for Air Force-industry
CRADA, or pre-existing license agreement terms and conditions.
   A2.2.1. In all software releases, the Air Force must ensure that it will not be held liable for
   any failure of the released software or its continued maintenance. This also applies to Air
   Force software deposited in all software reuse libraries. As such, the OPR must ensure that
   recipients of software from the reuse libraries understand this waiver of warranties and
   damages liability.
A2.3. Memorandum of Agreement: I/We the undersigned, on behalf of the Requesting
Organization listed below (hereafter referred to as the "Requester"), request release of (software
name) and understand and agree to the following:
 a. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. The Requester requests some or all of the following
