SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision is a complete rewrite resulting from an initiative to reduce and simplify the
SAF/XC departmental-level publications. SAF/XC is changing all their publications from
“stove-piped” system/program-based to audience/role-based by consolidating like information
from existing AFIs. The end result will simplify use and maintenance of SAF/XC's policy and
procedures. This AFI will contain communication and information guidance and responsibilities
for commanders, while other AFI’s will address general users and implementers. The
information contained in this publication was extracted from the publications identified in
Attachment 3 and the system/program guidance and procedural information for the personnel
supporting each program will remain in those publications. The contents within this AFI will be
removed from existing AFI’s upon publishing.

(480ISRW) This document reflects the substantial changes made in current AF guidance. It
identifies Communications Systems and Information Officers (CSO) at the Wing and Group
levels and delineates responsibilities between the installation and tenant CSOs.

1. Introduction.
   1.1. In an effort to meet the growing needs of today’s warfighter, great strides are being
   made to improve the capabilities offered by the Air Force provisioned portion of the Global
   Information Grid (GIG). Today’s warfighters are increasingly using these capabilities and
   have responsibilities for ensuring effective and efficient use and management of this
   resource. This increased reliance on warfighters is a result of the mainstreaming of
   technology and its integration into almost all activities of warfighting and support operations.
   This AFI identifies a commander's responsibilities for ensuring effective and efficient
   management of Information Technology (IT), Information Management (IM), and
   Information Assurance (IA). Compliance ensures appropriate personnel are
   assigned/appointed to accomplish identified duties.
2. Applicability.
