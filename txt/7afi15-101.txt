resources from hazardous conditions and to provide maximum flight safety. Each watch,
warning or advisory is assigned a number following the two-digit number of the current month
(e.g. 06-001 would be the first watch/warning/advisory issued in June). Multiple watches may
be in effect at any given time, however only one warning will be effect at one time for a given
location, excluding lightning watches/warnings. Although only one warning may be in effect at
one time for a given location, they may include multiple criteria (e.g. severe winds, runway
crosswinds and thunderstorms). Multiple advisories may be in effect at the same time for a
location.
4.2. WWA Responsibilities.
