SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It identifies the new
Base Commissary Officer in Attachment 6 and Attachment 7.
1. General. Baggers and carryout services are provided to the commissary patron through a
Licensee AGREEMENT. These persons are not employees of the commissary. No person has
the authority to enter an Air Force installation and transact bagger/carryout services as a matter
of right. Bagger and carryout services will be permitted only if the following conditions are met:
 2                                                     SHAWAFBI90-104 10 OCTOBER 2012


     1.1. . The individual has been selected by the Head Bagger and issued a Licensee
     AGREEMENT (Attachment 2) through the Installation Commander. Selections will be
     made through a list maintained by the Head Bagger. The list will be maintained as follows:
        1.1.1. Priority 1. Active duty personnel, E4 and below, with a financial hardship.
        Hardship must be coordinated through the individual's first sergeant.
        1.1.2. Priority 2. All other personnel available for fulltime work, who possess a valid
        DD Form 2AF, Armed Forces Identification Card (Active); DD Form 1173, Uniform
        Services Identification and Privilege Card (Dependent); DD Form 2, (Retired); or DD
        Form 2AFRES (Reservist).
     1.2. Individuals must be 15 years of age or older to perform bagger/carryout services.
     1.3. Individuals must provide bagger/carryout services IAW the Bagger Licensee
     AGREEMENT and the bagger rules listed at Attachment 3 between themselves and the
     Installation Commander.
2. Termination of Bagger’s License Agreement. Any rude, loud, or obnoxious behavior by
any bagger in the bagging area, or in the presence of a customer, will result in the immediate
termination of their Licensee AGREEMENT between themselves and the Installation
Commander. Loud behavior includes shouting to individuals several lanes away to indicate they
want to bag, have moved, or similar messages. This shouting is distracting to customers and
cashiers and is not considered proper action in a place of business.
3. Termination and suspension Authority.
     3.1. The Installation Commander or Commissary Officer has the authority to issue and
     revoke any Licensee AGREEMENT for serious violations of the bagger rules listed in
     Attachment 3.
     3.2. The Head Bagger has the authority to invoke suspensions from one day to two weeks
     for other violations.
4. Head Bagger Duties and Responsibilities. The Head Bagger will perform duties as outlined
in Attachment 4.
5. Election of Head Bagger. The Head Bagger will be elected by a vote of all authorized
baggers in February of each year. Those baggers who place their name in for nomination must
ensure that they can comply with all the requirements and duties outlined in this directive. Each
candidate for election as Head Bagger will indicate the fee that they will charge each bagger on a
daily basis during the coming year. This fee will be indicated on the ballot next to the candidates
name at the time of election. The fee indicated by the elected individual will remain in effect for
the entire year unless changed at a special meeting of all the baggers and agreed upon by a
majority vote. The Head Bagger cannot arbitrarily change the bagger fee without approval of a
majority of the baggers. The Installation Commander or Commissary Officer may call a special
election at his/her discretion if circumstances warrant. If a special election is directed due to
mismanagement by a Head Bagger, his/her Licensee AGREEMENT will be revoked, and he/she
must go back on the bagger waiting list for reinstatement. If a Head Bagger resigns his/her
position, for other than medical reasons, he/she is ineligible to be a candidate at the next
regularly scheduled election. If a Head Bagger is not elected, the Installation Commander or
Commissary Officer will appoint a Head Bagger. Should a Head Bagger be relieved of duty

because of personal misconduct, the Installation Commander or Commissary Officer, at their
discretion, can appoint a Head Bagger and assistants to complete the term of the relieved Head
Bagger. A Head Bagger relieved due to personal misconduct will have their Licensee
AGREEMENT permanently revoked.
6. Bagger Meetings. From timetotime baggers will be required to attend meetings when
information must be disseminated. Baggers who fail to attend scheduled meetings without prior
approval of the Head Bagger or Commissary Officer are subject to having their Licensee
AGREEMENT revoked.
