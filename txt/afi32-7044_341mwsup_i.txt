                                        INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Concept. Inherent in the mission of the Air Force are the associated environmental
responsibilities of protecting human health and the environment, and managing the natural
resources whose care has been entrusted to the Air Force. The Air Force will prevent pollution
by reducing the use of hazardous materials and release of pollutants into the environment to as
near zero as is technically and economically feasible. This will be done first through source
reduction, e.g., chemical substitution, process change, and other techniques. Where
environmentally damaging materials must be used, their use will be minimized and controlled. If
the use of such materials cannot be avoided, the spent material or waste will be reused or
recycled whenever technically feasible and cost-effective. As a last resort, spent material or
waste that cannot be reused or recycled must be treated to reduce waste volume and toxicity
whenever feasible, and disposed in an environmentally safe manner, consistent with the
requirements of all applicable laws. Refer to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-7080, Pollution
Prevention Program, for a discussion of this environmental management hierarchy.
1.2. Scope. This AFI describes the environmental and engineering requirements for
underground and aboveground storage tanks and associated piping that store petroleum and
hazardous substances. This AFI does not address the storage of hazardous waste in tanks.
Hazardous waste storage is addressed in AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance
and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 32-7043, Hazardous Waste Management Guide. Consult AFI
23-204, Organizational Fuel Tanks, for guidelines and procedures on establishing and operating
organizational fuel tanks.
1.3. Objectives. This instruction provides Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating
Agencies (FOA), Direct Reporting Units (DRU), and installations with a framework for
complying with regulatory requirements for storage tanks and associated piping that store
petroleum and hazardous substances except hazardous waste. In the United States and its
territories, use this guidance with applicable Federal, state, and local standards for storage tanks.
For Department of Defense (DoD) components at installations outside the United States, its
territories, and possessions, implement the applicable portions of this AFI (i.e., all paragraphs
except those with asterisks) in accordance with the applicable Final Governing Standards (FGS)
or, in their absence, the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD). See
AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in Foreign Countries, for additional environmental
guidance for overseas installations.
1.4. Applicable Standards and Regulations. The Air Force complies with applicable Federal,
state, and local laws and regulations; Executive Orders (E.O.); DoD and Air Force policies; and,
outside Continental United States (OCONUS), with the OEBGD, appropriate FGS, international
agreements, and applicable portions of this AFI. The following description of regulations
applicable to storage tanks describes only the principal requirements and is not intended to be
exhaustive. Air Force personnel are expected to comply fully with the underlying regulatory
requirements of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 112 and 280, and the related
state programs. Other requirements may apply to storage tanks under the Clean Air Act (CAA),
AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011                                                              5


the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), other environmental
laws, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and the national codes
and standards listed in Attachment 2 to this AFI.
   1.4.1. Underground Storage Tanks (UST). The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA), Title 42, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 6901, et seq. regulates USTs that
   contain regulated substances.
       1.4.1.1. Regulated substances are defined at 40 CFR Section 280.12 and include
       hazardous substances regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
       Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., which are not
       otherwise regulated as RCRA hazardous waste, and petroleum and petroleum-based
       substances.
       1.4.1.2. The Federal UST standards are found in 40 CFR Parts 280 and 281 (for approval
       of state UST programs.).
       1.4.1.3. The Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., Spill Prevention and
       Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Facility Response Plan (FRP) requirements,
       found in 40 CFR Part 112, do not apply to USTs that are regulated under 40 CFR Part
       280 and 281, except that USTs need to be included in the facility diagram (as provided in
       40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)) or if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regional
       Administrator otherwise requires the USTs to be included in the SPCC Plan (as provided
       in 40 CFR 112.1(f).)
       1.4.1.4. The CAA requirements in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Kb, Standards of
       Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels for Which Construction,
       Reconstruction, or Modification Commenced after July 23, 1984, apply to USTs as
       pertinent.
   1.4.2. Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST). There is no single Federal standard applicable to
   all ASTs as of the date of this instruction. Guidance on the construction and operation of
   petroleum ASTs can be found in the Air Force standard design for bulk jet fuel tanks and
   Military Handbook (MIL–HDBK) 1022, Petroleum Fuel Facilities, and on the websites of
   the National Fire Protection Association, the American Petroleum Institute, and from other
   sources (including some of the national codes and standards listed in Attachment 2 to this
   AFI.).
       1.4.2.1. The SPCC and FRP requirements, discussed in paragraph 1.4.1.3, generally
       apply to ASTs that are bulk storage containers where, due to location, a discharge could
       reasonably be expected to reach navigable waters (including sewer pathways), unless
       both: (i) the completely buried storage capacity of a facility is 42,000 gallons or less of
       oil; and (ii) the aggregate aboveground storage capacity of the facility is 1,320 gallons or
       less of oil. Note that containers of oil with a capacity of less than 55 gallons are not
       counted for purposes of this determination.
          1.4.2.1.1. The SPCC Plan is the document required by 40 CFR 112.3 that details the
          equipment, workforce, procedures and steps to prevent, control, and provide adequate
          countermeasures to a discharge. For Air Force installations, 40 CFR 112.3 – 112.8
          lists the relevant requirements for preparing a SPCC Plan.

           1.4.2.1.1.1. (Added-341MW) The           Spill   Prevention,    Control,     and
           Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan documents the procedures for the prevention,
           response, control and reporting of spills and must be complied with by all SPCC
           organizations associated with Malmstrom AFB.
           1.4.2.1.1.2. (Added-341MW) A SPCC organization is an organization that
           stores or uses oil in containers or equipment with a capacity of 55 gallons or
           more. This includes Malmstrom AFB organizations, as well as tenants and
           contractors. All contractors are required to have their own SPCC plans if they
           exceed the SPCC oil storage capacity thresholds. SPCC organizations are required
           to engage in spill prevention activities, which include but are not limited to
           routine inspections of equipment and storage containers. SPCC organizations are
           required to engage in spill response and cleanup activities for small spills that
           they are capable of safely working. A SPCC organization must verify its
           inventory in the SPCC and notify 341 CES/CEANQ when purchasing or
           installing new storage containers for oil or taking containers out of service.
           1.4.2.1.1.3. (Added-341MW) SPCC organizations must designate a person
           responsible for the management of oil within their organization. This designated
           person is referred to as the SPCC coordinator. The SPCC coordinator must
           ensure that personnel who handle oil receive spill prevention training on an
           annual basis.
           1.4.2.1.1.4. (Added-341MW) All SPCC organizations are responsible for
           understanding the SPCC plan. Contact 341 CES/CEANQ, the SPCC plan office
           of primary responsibility, to obtain a copy.
       1.4.2.1.2. A facility shall also determine, in accordance with 40 CFR 112.20,
       whether, because of its location, a spill of oil could cause substantial harm to the
       environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining
       shorelines.*
           1.4.2.1.2.1. If the facility determines that it does not meet the substantial harm
           criteria, it shall complete and maintain certification that the criteria do not apply.*
           1.4.2.1.2.2. If the facility determines that it does meet the substantial harm
           criteria, it shall prepare a FRP as provided in 40 CFR Part 112 Appendix F or as
           required by the EPA Regional Administrator.*
    1.4.2.2. ASTs that contain used oil, as defined in 40 CFR 279.1, must also meet the
    applicable RCRA used oil management requirements of 40 CFR Part 279. ASTs storing
    or treating hazardous waste must meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 264, Subparts J
    and CC, and Part 265, Subparts J and CC.
    1.4.2.3. The CAA requirements in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Kb, Standards of
    Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Vessels for Which Construction,
    Reconstruction, or Modification Commenced after July 23, 1984 and Part 81 Designation
    of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes apply to ASTs as pertinent.
AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011                                                           7


   1.4.3. States may adopt or enact storage tank regulations as long as those regulations are at
   least as stringent as Federal storage tank regulations. Air Force installations must comply
   with state or local (a) UST regulations: and (b) AST requirements where sovereign immunity
   has been waived. Installations should consult with the installation Staff Judge Advocate to
   obtain guidance on whether state or local government can regulate installation ASTs.
   1.4.4. Air Force activities in overseas locations must implement this AFI in accordance with
   the appropriate FGS or, in their absence, the OEBGD. AFI 32-7006, Air Force
   Environmental Program in Foreign Countries describes implementation of the Air Force
   environmental program in other nations. Provisions of this AFI that are subject to different
   treatment overseas are designated by an asterisk ―*‖.

                                          Chapter 2

      COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR STORAGE TANKS AND ASSOCIATED
                               PIPING

2.1. General Tank System Requirements. There is no single correct storage tank. Factors to
consider when selecting the type storage tank are provided in Attachment 6. Once a tank type is
selected, obtain the approval of the Installation Commander. All tank systems (existing and new)
that contain a regulated substance (e.g. petroleum, petroleum based product, or hazardous
substance) must comply with the requirements listed in this paragraph. Overseas installations
must comply with the OEBGD or FGS as well as the requirements listed below.
   2.1.1. Construction. Storage tanks must be constructed to prevent releases due to leaks
       2.1.1.1. USTs must have double wall construction with interstitial monitoring. See MIL-
       HDBK-1022, Petroleum Fuel Facilities (30 Jun 1997) § 2.13.6.
       2.1.1.2. ASTs containing oil must have internal (self-diking) or external secondary
       containment and/or diversionary structures or equipment wherever required. See
       generally MIL-HDBK-1022 for further details. See also API Standard 650, Welded Steel
       Tanks for Oil Storage-Includes Addendum 1 and 2; API Standard 653, Tank Inspection,
       Repair, Alteration, and Reconstruction-Includes Addenda 1-4. All determinations under
       this paragraph need to be documented in the SPCC Plan.
           2.1.1.2.1. Self-diking tanks must be capable of containing the entire capacity of the
           inner tank if it fails within (a) the interstitial space; (b) a secondary containment
           system; or (c) both. Tanks with concrete outer shells are not satisfactory for this
           purpose.
           2.1.1.2.2. External secondary containment includes dikes, containment curbs, pits or
           drainage trenches that must be sufficient to hold the entire capacity of the largest
           single container and sufficient freeboard to contain normal annual precipitation
           events, in the opinion of the certifying professional engineer.
       2.1.1.3. Facility tank car and tank truck loading/unloading areas without a catchment
       basin or treatment facility must provide a containment system that must be sufficient to
       hold the entire capacity of the largest single container at that area and, if there is no
       continuously present on-site operator, sufficient freeboard to contain normal annual
       precipitation events, in the opinion of the certifying professional engineer.
       2.1.1.4. Facility tank car and tank truck loading/unloading storage/parking areas for
       vehicles operated primarily off-installation and where loading/unloading does not occur
       do not require a catchment basin or treatment facility.
   2.1.2. Meet Performance Standards. Tank systems and piping must be installed according to
   applicable Federal, state and local requirements, and the appropriate national codes and
   standards for new tank systems as detailed in Attachment 2.
       2.1.2.1. Corrosion Protection for Tank Systems. Prevent corrosion by only installing
       tanks made of one of the following:
           2.1.2.1.1. Fiberglass-reinforced plastic (for USTs and certain ASTs.)
AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011                                                          13


        2.1.2.1.2. Coated cathodically protected steel (for USTs and vaulted tanks.)
        2.1.2.1.3. Steel-fiberglass-reinforced plastic composite (for all types of storage
        tanks.)
        2.1.2.1.4. Coated steel (for ASTs.)
     2.1.2.2. Corrosion Protection for Piping. Use fiberglass-reinforced plastic or cathodically
     protected, coated steel. Specialty products (i.e., double wall systems using a flexible
     carrier pipe for service stations) may be used. Bases that are unfamiliar with such
     products should consult with the MAJCOM or AFCESA before using them. See
     applicable state and local requirements, and Attachment 2 for national codes and
     standards.
     2.1.2.3. Release Detection for Tanks. USTs and other type tanks, where required by state
     or local requirements, must have at least one of the following release detection
     monitoring systems:
        2.1.2.3.1. Automatic tank gauging.
        2.1.2.3.2. Vapor monitoring.
        2.1.2.3.3. New groundwater monitoring systems in areas with no known prior
        contamination.
        2.1.2.3.4. Continuous monitoring of the interstitial space between the tank system
        and a secondary barrier.
        2.1.2.3.5. Other effective methods that comply with environmental regulations.
     2.1.2.4. Secondary containment for service stations and tank systems. Some states such
     as Florida and California, require complete secondary containment for tanks and lines of
     all UST systems. For service stations, this requires the addition of containment sumps for
     tank piping entries and for dispensers. Service stations with reasonably short runs of
     piping should always use double wall piping or other secondary containment for piping.
     2.1.2.5. Release Detection for Piping. Automatic line-leak detection is to be installed
     with all new pressurized piping. Suction piping operating at less than atmospheric
     pressure that drains the contents back into the tank, with a single check valve below the
     suction pump, does not require release detection. Suction piping that does not have leak
     detection must either be subject to an appropriate line tightness test annually or monitor
     this piping monthly using a release detection monitoring method that detects piping leaks.
     Follow applicable state and local requirements, and the appropriate national codes and
     standards in Attachment 2. Underground piping for hazardous substances must be
     equipped with secondary containment (e.g., trench liners, jacketing or double-walled
     pipe.) Automatic line leak detection for pressurized lines may not be available from all
     manufacturers At some locations, only interstitial monitoring may be available for line
     leak detection for ASTs. Ensure that line leak detection system is installed as
     recommended to avoid interference with operation of AST anti-siphon device. This
     paragraph does not apply to pipelines carrying aircraft petroleum products (See MIL
     HDBK 1022).
 14                                               AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011


       2.1.2.6. Spill and Overfill Prevention.
           2.1.2.6.1. Generally. Tank equipment must prevent spills when the transfer hose
           detaches. Control overfilling by using an automatic shutoff, overfill containment,
           containment bucket and other options such as alarms and regular observation of tank
           fillings.
           2.1.2.6.2. ASTs. AST capacity should be adequate to ensure that a container will not
           overfill if pumper/gauger is delayed in making regularly scheduled rounds. See 40
           CFR 112.9(b) (i). Each tank should be engineered or updated in accordance with
           good engineering practice to avoid discharges and must include at least one of the
           devices listed in 40 CFR 112.8(c)(8).
       2.1.2.7. Regulatory Agency Notification and Certification. For new USTs, the
       installation must:
           2.1.2.7.1. Obtain proper notification and certification forms including necessary
           permits from the appropriate regulatory agency.
           2.1.2.7.2. Where required, send state or local agencies a notice of intent to install a
           tank before starting construction.
           2.1.2.7.3. Notify the appropriate regulatory agency of all new ASTs/USTs within 30
           calendar days after use of a newly installed AST/UST commences.
           2.1.2.7.4. Obtain recent certification that tank was installed according to national
           codes and standards, and maintain as built drawings in appropriate files.
           2.1.2.7.5. Notify the regulator in advance if the installation cannot meet a regulatory
           deadline.
   2.1.3. Anchor all parts to USTs, vaulted tanks, and cylindrical ASTs to prevent floating in
   floods or dislocation in earthquakes or other conditions. USTs and vaulted tanks must not be
   installed at a site located in a 25-year flood plain.
   2.1.4. Comply with Air Force management practices for maintenance of jet fuel and other
   petroleum products.
   2.1.5. Comply with National Fire Protection Association standards, and OSHA design,
   hazard communication, and confined space entry requirements.
2.2. Monitoring for Releases. Installations must periodically check tank systems for leaks.
   2.2.1. USTs. During the first year following installation, check leak detection systems of
   new USTs every 30 days to verify proper functioning.
       2.2.1.1. Existing USTs. Determine monitoring requirements for USTs installed before 22
       December 1988 according to these categories:
           2.2.1.1.1. Upgraded USTs Without Release Detection Systems. For USTs that meet
           the requirements in paragraph 2.1 but lack a release detection monitoring system, use
           monthly inventory controls and conduct tightness testing at least every 5 years until
           10 years after the tank was upgraded.
AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011                                                              15


          2.2.1.1.2. Upgraded USTs With Release Detection Systems. Upgraded USTs must
          meet the monitoring standards in paragraph 2.2.1.
   2.2.2. ASTs. For ASTs that contain petroleum oil, including valves or piping that are entirely
   within buildings:
      2.2.2.1. These ASTs are subject to integrity and leak testing regularly and when material
      repairs are made.
          2.2.2.1.1. The frequency of regular AST integrity testing must take into account
          container (tank) size and design and be consistent with industry standards.
          2.2.2.1.2. For self-diking ASTs, check the interstitial space for leaks at least
          quarterly.
      2.2.2.2. Small, shop-built ASTs that are not in contact with the ground, all sides are
      visible and are inspected at least monthly may use visual inspection for integrity testing,
      consistent with good engineering practice.
      2.2.2.3. ASTs on the ground generally must be subject to (a) visual integrity testing and
      (b) another testing technique such as hydrostatic testing, radiographic testing, ultrasonic
      testing, acoustic emissions testing, or another system of non-destructive testing.
      2.2.2.4. For self-diking ASTs, check the interstial space at least quarterly for leaks.
      2.2.2.5. Material repairs include removing the annular plate ring; replacement of the
      container bottom; jacking of a container shell; installation of a 12-inch or larger nozzle in
      the shell; a door sheet, tombstone replacement in the shell, or other shell repair; or, such
      repairs that might potentially change the potential for oil to be discharged from the
      container.
   2.2.3. New and Existing Pressurized Piping. Perform a line tightness test annually or monitor
   this piping monthly using a release detection monitoring method that detects piping leaks.
   2.2.4. New and Existing Suction Piping. Perform a line tightness test at least every 3 years or
   use a monthly monitoring method that detects piping leaks in single walled suction piping.
2.3. Operating and Maintaining Tanks.
   2.3.1. Spill and Overfill Control. To prevent spills:
      2.3.1.1. Make sure that available tank capacity exceeds the volume of the product being
      transferred into the tank.
      2.3.1.2. Monitor the transfer operation constantly.
      2.3.1.3. Overflow equipment in the tank should include:
          2.3.1.3.1. A minimum 15 gallon spill bucket; and
          2.3.1.3.2. A fill pipe that will:
              2.3.1.3.2.1. Alert the operator by restricting flow into the tank or triggering a high
              level alarm before tank is 90% full; and
              2.3.1.3.2.2. Automatically shuts off flow into the tank when the tank is not more
              than 95% full.

   2.3.2. Corrosion Protection for Steel USTs and Steel ASTs in Direct Contact with Soil.
      2.3.2.1. Have a qualified cathodic protection specialist (i.e., a person certified by the
      National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE)), inspect new cathodic protection
      systems in accordance with Air Force procedures for the maintenance and operation of
      cathodic protection systems or according to another reasonable time frame established by
      the implementing agency. (At a minimum, Federal regulations require that this occur
      within 6 months of installation and at least every 3 years thereafter (40 CFR 280.31(b)
      (1)).
      2.3.2.2. Inspect impressed current cathodic protection systems every 60 calendar days
      and galvanic systems annually.
      2.3.2.3. Check USTs quarterly, and ASTs as provided in 2.2.2.1 for corrosion.
   2.3.3. Repairs. Follow these guidelines:
      2.3.3.1. Use qualified personnel licensed by state to perform repairs on all USTs, if
      required by state regulations, and authorized Inspectors (AI) to certify that repairs were
      performed on ASTs.
      2.3.3.2. Perform tightness testing of USTs, including piping, within 30 calendar days or
      earlier of completing repairs to any UST or underground piping.
      2.3.3.3. Integrity testing of a tank system must be performed on a repaired cathodic
      protection system before the tank system is returned to service. Thereafter, follow
      paragraph 2.3.2.
2.4. Release Response, Cleanup, and Reporting.
   2.4.1. Suspected Releases
      2.4.1.1. Suspected releases from USTs must be reported to the regulators within 24 hours
      and appropriate investigation and confirmation steps taken. The following are considered
      suspected releases:
          2.4.1.1.1. The discovery of regulated substances at the UST site or in the surrounding
          area (such as free product or vapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility lines and
          near surface water).
          2.4.1.1.2. Unusual operating conditions, such as the erratic behavior of dispensing
          equipment, the sudden loss of product from the system, or an unexplained loss of
          product from the system. (Note that mechanical automatic line leak detectors and
          some electronic line leak detectors signal a suspected line leak by greatly slowing
          down the flow of product in the distribution line. This can appear as erratic operation
          of dispensing equipment.) Any of these conditions are considered a suspected release
          unless system equipment is found to be defective but not leaking within the 24 hour
          period allowed for reporting suspected releases and is immediately repaired or
          replaced.
AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011                                                           17


         2.4.1.1.3. Monitoring results from a required tank or line release detection method
         that indicate a release may have occurred must be reported as a suspected release
         unless the following conditions can be met within the allowed 24-hour period. These
         conditions are: the monitoring device is found to be defective and is immediately
         repaired, recalibrated, or replaced and additional monitoring does not confirm the
         initial result.
         2.4.1.1.4. If inventory control shows excessive variance (that is, monthly
         reconciliations using the EPA leak check comparison of book inventories versus tank
         measurements exceeds 1% of tank throughput plus 130 gallons), a suspected release
         must be reported and followed up if there are two consecutive months of excessive
         variances.
  2.4.2. Responding to Releases.
     2.4.2.1. If a release of a regulated substance stored in a tank system is suspected, take
     immediate action to investigate and confirm the release using the following steps:
         2.4.2.1.1. Perform a tightness test of the system.
         2.4.2.1.2. If a release is suspected because of the discovery of environmental
         contamination in the vicinity of the tank but a leak is not detected in the tank system,
         perform a site check by sampling and measuring for contamination at the tank site.
     2.4.2.2. If a release from a tank system is confirmed:
         2.4.2.2.1. Remove as much of the regulated substances from the tank as necessary to
         prevent any further release.
         2.4.2.2.2. Inspect visually for evidence of any above ground or below ground
         releases.
         2.4.2.2.3. Prevent further migration of the regulated substance release to the
         surrounding soils and groundwater.
         2.4.2.2.4. Identify and mitigate fire, explosion, and vapor hazards.
         2.4.2.2.5. Report the release as provided in paragraph 2.4.4.
  2.4.3. Cleaning Up Releases. Coordinate these actions with regulatory authorities:
     2.4.3.1. Corrective Action for Petroleum or Hazardous Substance Tanks. The installation
     must take corrective action in response to a confirmed release from a tank as follows:
         2.4.3.1.1. For tanks located at installations with a RCRA hazardous waste permit take
         corrective action in accordance with RCRA Subtitle C requirements (40 CFR
         264.101, 264.552, and 264.553), and any more stringent and applicable state
         hazardous waste regulations.
         2.4.3.1.2. For tanks located at installations without a RCRA hazardous waste permit,
         take corrective action in accordance with 40 CFR Part 280 Subpart F, and any more
         stringent and applicable state hazardous waste regulations.

     2.4.3.2. Remove Free Product. If the presence of free product outside the tank system is
     confirmed, as soon as possible remove this regulated substance to the maximum extent
     practicable.
     2.4.3.3. Investigate Soil and Groundwater. Determine the extent and location of
     contaminated soil and groundwater. Comply with requests from the regulatory agency for
     additional information or a corrective action plan to clean up contaminated soil, surface
     water or groundwater.
     2.4.3.4. Site Remediation. Remediate contaminated tank sites to protect human health
     and the environment.
         2.4.3.4.1. In the Continental United Status (CONUS):
            2.4.3.4.1.1. If the regulatory agency approves, cleanup actions may begin before
            the corrective action plan is completed.*
            2.4.3.4.1.2. Dispose of contaminated soil, contaminated water and other cleanup
            waste according to applicable Federal, state, and local regulations.*
            2.4.3.4.1.3. Remove free product in groundwater and dispose of it consistent with
            federal, state and local law. To the maximum extent appropriate, also use
            monitored natural attenuation, remedies that prevent further migration of the
            plume, source control and institutional controls consistent with regulator
            direction.*
         2.4.3.4.2. For overseas installations, follow the remediation policy in Department of
         Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4715.8, Environmental Remediation for DoD Activities
         Overseas.
  2.4.4. Reporting Releases.
     2.4.4.1. Release Notification. Notify the regulatory agency consistent with the applicable
     Federal, state, or local requirements.
         2.4.4.1.1. Notice of a release is generally required if:
            2.4.4.1.1.1. A release is discovered from a tank system.
            2.4.4.1.1.2. Unusual conditions occur, such as apparent erratic behavior of
            equipment, loss of product, unexplained water in tanks or product in the
            interstitial space.
            2.4.4.1.1.3. A spill or overfill of petroleum occurs that exceeds 25 gallons or
            causes a sheen on nearby surface water.

   2.5.1. Keep these records readily available for inspection at the installation CEV or
   Environmental Management Office:
      2.5.1.1. Tank Inventories. MAJCOMs and installations are to use an existing information
      management system to develop and maintain a comprehensive list of all tank systems
      locations and characteristics until an applicable Air Force-wide information management
      system is available This will also be used to track and report UST compliance status
      accurately. Refer to AFI 32-7002, Environmental Information Management System for
      general guidance.
         2.5.1.1.1. Update data when tank systems are removed, replaced, or upgraded or

              2.5.1.2.3.6. Where tank leak detection is performed with an automatic tank
              gauge, records of monthly inventory reconciliation should be kept for at least the
              previous year to demonstrate compliance with 40 CFR 280.43(d)(2).
          2.5.1.2.4. The results of the site investigation conducted during permanent closure.
          For at least three years after closing a UST, CE must keep records of the site
          assessment results required for permanent closure. It is also recommended that all
          tank records be maintained for 25 years or the operational life of the tank whichever
          is longer.
          2.5.1.2.5. Reports of releases or suspected releases.
2.6. Budgeting for Tanks . Budgeting for tank-related costs must be consistent with this AFI,
except that the budgeting for tank-related costs also must conform to:
   2.6.1. The procedures and limitations provided in AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting.
   2.6.2. The DESC funding authorities.
       2.6.2.1. DESC funds all operation and maintenance (O&M), operational environmental
       permits or fees, and other environmental-related costs for tanks used to store
       DLA/DESC-owned petroleum, oils, and lubricants.
       2.6.2.2. The DESC-F Web site generally identifies the types of maintenance, repair, and
       environmental compliance costs that DESC funds. The DESC-F Web site is identified on

distribution hydrant systems (40 CFR 280.10(c) (4)), but states may regulate these systems.
   2.7.1. Installations should nevertheless:
       2.7.1.1. Leak test hydrant fueling systems periodically because of high potential for leaks
       and groundwater contamination.
          2.7.1.1.1. Use a method such as an annual operating/hydrostatic pressure test or other
          appropriate methods.
          2.7.1.1.2. Coordinate local procedures with CE Liquid Fuel Maintenance in areas
          under Fuels Management Team (FMT) control.
          2.7.1.1.3. Consider installing automatic release detection systems on all new hydrant
          systems once the technology is proven.
   2.7.2. Installations should contact the appropriate Air Force Regional Environmental Office
   for guidance concerning applicability of state or local regulation of hydrant fueling systems.
2.8. AAFES Station Tanks.
   2.8.1. Installations are to support tanks at AAFES stations.
 22                                                AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011


       2.8.1.1. Installations need to consider obtaining funding for performance of appropriate
       activities with respect to AAFES-owned tanks installed after 30 September 1988.
       Environmental quality (EQ) Funds are not authorized to be used for any of the following
       and base O&M funds must be used with respect to AAFES tanks for purposes of:
           2.8.1.1.1. Inspecting.
           2.8.1.1.2. Maintaining.
           2.8.1.1.3. Repairing.

           2.8.1.1.7. Maintaining and updating records.
       2.8.1.2. Installations are responsible for obtaining and initial payment for any
       registrations, permits, or fees that are required for AAFES-owned tanks, subject to
       reimbursement by AAFES.
   2.8.2. AAFES’s responsibility for payment includes:
       2.8.2.1. Reimbursements for costs initially paid by installations for registrations, permits,
       or fees required for AAFES-owned tanks.
       2.8.2.2. Purchase, installation, monitoring, and repair or replacement of monitoring
       devices for AAFES-owned tanks.
       2.8.2.3. Installation and construction of new tanks, and costs for replacement of tanks
       and lines to increase or decrease capacity or enhance other tank features not required by
       new environmental regulations.
2.9. Existing Petroleum and Hazardous Substance UST Systems . Any petroleum or
regulated hazardous substance UST installed before 22 December 1988 had to meet certain UST
requirements in 40 CFR 280 by 22 December 1988. If a pre-22 December 1988 petroleum or
regulated hazardous substance UST at an installation is identified that was not upgraded prior to
the deadline, promptly notify the appropriate Air Force Regional Environmental Office for
guidance on how to proceed.
2.10. Closing USTs.
   2.10.1. Temporary Closure. When a UST system is temporarily closed, installations must
   continue to operate and maintain corrosion protection systems and, if the UST is not empty,
   operation and maintenance of the release detection systems is also required. If the UST
   system is temporarily closed for 3 months or more, leave vent lines open and cap and secure
   other lines, pumps, manways, and equipment. When an UST system is temporarily closed for
   more than 12 months, it must undergo permanent closure unless one of the following occurs:
       2.10.1.1. The UST meets the standards in paragraphs 2.1.2 and 2.2, except that spill and
       overflow prevention are not required.
       2.10.1.2. The regulatory agency approves an extension of the 12 month temporary
       closure period.*
AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011                                                           23


  2.10.2. Permanent Closure. Notify the regulatory agency before permanently closing a UST
  system or effecting a change in service consistent with the applicable Federal, state, or local
  requirements (e.g. 40 CFR 280.71(a) requires at least 30-day advance notice). Determine if
  the UST system leaked by measuring for a release where contamination is most likely, unless
  an external release detection method reliably shows no release occurred. Basic guidance
  pertaining to closure procedures may be found in MIL-HDBK 1022, Section 14.*
     2.10.2.1. If a release is discovered, begin corrective action as provided in paragraph 2.4.
     *
     2.10.2.2. If no release is found, empty and clean the tank of all liquid and sludge. *
     2.10.2.3. Except as provided in 2.10.2.4, no UST system shall be closed in place. A UST
     system that is subject to closure shall be properly removed and disposed of consistent
     with applicable state and local requirements and American Petroleum Institute (API)
     Recommended Practice 1604, Closure of Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks. EQ
     funds may not be used for this purpose, but removal and disposal may be funded by the
     associated project.
     2.10.2.4. USTs may be permissible to be abandoned under extenuating circumstances
     (such as it being determined that an UST is located under a building), if regulator
     approval is obtained.

Terms
Aboveground Storage Tank—An unburied storage tank, such as a bulk storage tank, and
includes any aboveground container containing oil, as provided in Title 40, Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) 112.1(b)(1); or bunkered tank, partially buried tank or completely buried tank
containing oil, as defined in 40 CFR 112.2.
Automated Line Leak Detectors—Devices attached to the pressurized piping from a service
station type dispenser for detection of 3 gallon per hour product loss. These detectors briefly
restrict flow after pump start up by sensing vapor space resultant from lost product in piping
during off periods.
Bulk Storage Tank—Has the same meaning here as ―bulk storage container‖ in Title 40, Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 112.2. An aboveground storage tank, of 55 gallons or greater
capacity, used to store oil, including the storage of oil prior to use, while being used, or prior to
further distribution in commerce. Oil-filled electrical, operating, or manufacturing equipment is
not a bulk storage container.
 28                                                AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011


Cathodic Protection—A technique for preventing corrosion of a metal surface by making the
surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell. A tank system can be cathodically protected by
applying either galvanic anodes or impressed current.
Change-In-Service—Continued use of an underground storage tank system to store an
unregulated substance.
Existing UST—A tank system containing a regulated substance that was installed on or before
22 December 1988.
Facility Response Plan—A plan required to be prepared in accordance with Title 40, Code of
Federal Regulations, Section 112.20 by an owner or operator of a non-transportation related
facility that, because of its location, reasonably can be expected to cause substantial harm to the
environment through the discharge of oil into or on navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.
Field Constructed Aboveground Storage Tanks—Large volume vertical cylindrical tanks
constructed on-site. The bottom surface of these tanks is in contact with ground and cannot be
visually inspected.
Final Governing Standards (FGS)—Country specific substantive provision concerning the
environment, typically technical limitations on effluent, discharges, etc., or a specific
management practice for Department of Defense (DoD) installations in specific countries.
Free Product—A regulated substance that exists as a non-aqueous phase liquid (a liquid that
does not dissolve in water).
Hazardous Substance Underground Storage Tank (UST)—An UST system containing a
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
hazardous substance that is not also a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
hazardous waste.
New Underground Storage Tank (UST)—A tank system containing a regulated substance that
was installed after 22 December 1988.
Oil—has the meaning provided for ―petroleum oil’ in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 112.2. It generally includes crude oil, fuel oil, gasoline, jet fuel, mineral oil, sludge, oil
refuse, greases, oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil, or any other kind or form of oil.
However, ―oil‖ as used in this Air Force Instruction (AFI) does not include ―animal oils‖ such
animal, fish or marine mammal fats, oils or greases; or ―vegetable oils‖ such as oils from seeds,
nuts, fruits, or kernels since the latter oils are not stored in tanks on Air Force installations.
Overfill Release—A release occurring when someone attempts to fill a tank beyond its capacity,
resulting in discharging the regulated substance to the environment.
Overseas—A nation, territory or geographic area that is outside the United States and its
territories.
Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD)—Developed by the
Department of Defense (DoD), a set of procedures and minimum criteria for environmental
compliance at DoD installations in overseas locations. It is used by the Environmental Executive
Agent to establish the Final Governing Standards (FGS), and in the case where no FGS exists,
provides the compliance criteria.
AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011                                                              29


Petroleum Aboveground Storage Tank (AST)—An AST containing petroleum or a petroleum
mixture, including: motor fuels, jet fuels, distillate fuel oils, residential fuel oils, lubricants,
petroleum solvents, and used oils.
Petroleum Underground Storage Tank (UST)—An UST system containing petroleum or a
petroleum mixture, including: motor fuels, jet fuels, distillate fuel oils, residential fuel oils,
lubricants, petroleum solvents, and used oils.
Regulated Substance—Has the meaning provided in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations,
Section 280.12 and any more protective state regulation. It generally includes:
(1) Petroleum, including crude oil or any crude oil mixture that remains a liquid at standard
temperatures and pressures. "Regulated substances" include petroleum and petroleum based
substances composed of a complex blend of hydrocarbons derived from crude oil through
separation, conversion, upgrading, and finishing, such as: motor fuels, jet fuels, distillate fuel
oils, residual fuel oils, lubricants, petroleum solvents, and used oils.
(2) Any hazardous substance defined in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, but not including any substance
regulated as a hazardous waste under subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) of 1976.
Release—Spilling, leaking, emitting, discharging, escaping, leaching, or disposing of a
substance from an underground storage tank into groundwater, surface water, or soil.
Release Detection—Determining if an underground storage tank (UST) system has released a
regulated substance into the environment or into the interstitial space between a UST system and
its secondary barrier or secondary containment area. Common release detection methods include:
(1) Inventory Control. A physical accounting system in which records are kept of input, output,
and daily tank inventories, including:
(2) Manual Tank Gauging. Measuring a tank’s liquid level at the beginning and end of a 36-hour
time period and calculating the change in volume. Limited to 550-gallon or smaller USTs when
manual tank gauging is used alone.
(3) Tank-Tightness Testing. One of several technologies that can measure very small changes in
product volume to find a leak. Civil Engineering (CE) must adjust the results for temperature,
structural deformation, trapped air, and so on.
(4) Automatic Tank Gauging. Collecting release detection and inventory information by
continuously monitoring the product level.
(5) Nonvolumetric Tank-Tightness Testing. Includes a variety of methodologies that apply to
piping and tanks of any size. Some involve injecting a tracer gas for monitoring the presence of a
release outside the tank. Others track the sound of product or bubbles leaving the tank. In about
50% of the cases, piping leaks are the cause.
(6) Secondary Containment with Interstitial Monitoring. Detects product in the space between
the wall of the tank and the secondary containment liner or wall. Applies to piping and tanks of
any size.
 30                                                AFI32-7044_341MWSUP_I 21 APRIL 2011


(7) Groundwater Monitoring. Detects regulated substances in groundwater. The substance must
be immiscible in water and have a specific gravity less than 1.0. Applies to piping and tanks of
any size.
(8) Vapor Monitoring. Detects fuel vapors in soil above the groundwater table. This test is not
always reliable. Applies to tanks of any size and piping.
(9) Release Detection for Piping. Note that automatic line leak detectors are manufactured only
for small diameter piping on systems with low flow rates normally associated with submersible
pumps and service station dispensers to issue ground fuels. Automatic line leak detectors are not
intended for high volume pressurized piping for aviation hydrant systems or truck loading
facilities. These systems are excluded from this requirement if the flow rates exceed 10 gallons
per minute. Periodic line testing or monitoring may still be required per paragraph cp2.2.3.
Self-Diking Tanks or Aboveground Secondary Containment (Vaulted) Tanks—Small
rectangular or horizontal cylindrical aboveground storage tanks (AST) delivered to the site fully
constructed. These tanks have integral secondary containment which is sometimes filled with
lightweight concrete for fire protection.
Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure—Means the Clean Water Act oil pollution
prevention procedures provided in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 112.
Storage Tank—A stationary device that contains an accumulation of regulated substances.
Tank in a Vault—A tank located above the floor of a subterranean vault.
Underground Storage Tank (UST)—Any tank or combination of tanks (including underground
pipes connected to the tank), with a volume of at least 110 gallons, that contains an accumulation
of regulated substances, where 10 percent or more of the volume (including underground pipes
connected to the tank) lies beneath the ground surface. NOTE: The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has exempted, excluded, or deferred certain USTs from regulation in the
continental United Status (CONUS) in the following circumstances:

                        UST COST ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS

A4.1. Estimate the costs of upgrading the UST system, the recurring costs of testing and
monitoring the UST system, and estimated cost of cleanup and repair in the event of a leak from
the UST system.
A4.2. Estimate the average cost of investigating and reporting the discovery of regulated
substances at the UST site or in the surrounding area or unusual leak detection or other unusual
UST operating conditions.
A4.3. Estimate the annual state and local regulatory costs of operating the UST, including the
cost of preparing or revising all necessary permits, recordkeeping costs, and registration, permit,
or other fees required for the installation or operation of the UST.
A4.4. Consider the estimated cost of any fine that may result from noncompliance with Federal,
state, or local UST requirements.
A4.5. Weigh the above against the estimated cost of replacing the UST system with an AST that
meets environmental, fire, safety, antiterrorism, and land use requirements, and the associated
Federal, state, and local regulatory costs for operation of that AST.

            TANK SELECTION AND COST ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS

A6.1. There is no ―right‖ tank for every situation. When choosing a tank consider the following:
   A6.1.1. ASTs.
       A6.1.1.1. Leaks can be seen and easily contained.
       A6.1.1.2. Piping is visible so leaks are visible.
       A6.1.1.3. In general, minimal environmental actions and record keeping.
       A6.1.1.4. Prone to corrosion and pipe leak problems, especially in coastal areas.
       A6.1.1.5. Must be protected from being hit by vehicles.
       A6.1.1.6. Subject to vandalism.
       A6.1.1.7. Fuel spill potential from siphonage. May not be a good candidate for
       unattended operation.
       A6.1.1.8. One to three cent fuel surcharge for gasoline because offload is pumped rather
       than gravity dropped – takes a special truck. This is not a concern for heating fuel since
       pumping is a standard procedure.
       A6.1.1.9. Pressure fill increases spill potential – failures of hoses, pump, tank overflow
       device.
       A6.1.1.10. In hot climates and during the summer, gasoline vapor releases to the
       atmosphere greater than other options.
       A6.1.1.11. Hose cannot be emptied, small releases occasionally occur.
       A6.1.1.12. Pressurized line leak detection with mechanical or precision electronic line
       leak detectors may not be available for certain AST configurations.
   A6.1.2. Tanks in Vaults.
       A6.1.2.1. EPA treats tanks in vaults the same as an AST. Minimal environmental actions
       and record keeping.
       A6.1.2.2. Leaks are contained.
       A6.1.2.3. Leaks may be visible.
       A6.1.2.4. More familiar and simple gravity fill.
       A6.1.2.5. Fuel temperature more stable thus less vapor release to the atmosphere.
       A6.1.2.6. Poor choice where there is a high water table – Tank shifting, breaking pipes,
       spills.
       A6.1.2.7. Not suitable in seismic areas – horizontal stresses.
       A6.1.2.8. Special precautions needed to prevent corrosion of tank, piping, and
       accessories.
       A6.1.2.9. Water intrusion a problem.

       A6.1.2.10. Spills may not be caught immediately.
       A6.1.2.11. Can not see if overfill problems occurring.
       A6.1.2.12. Difficult to remove water.
       A6.1.2.13. Water removed usually treated as hazardous substance.
       A6.1.2.14. Difficult and costly to enter.
       A6.1.2.15. May require continuous ventilation.
       A6.1.2.16. Problems with vapor recovery systems.
       A6.1.2.17. Potential for settling.
   A6.1.3. Double wall USTs.
       A6.1.3.1. Leaks into or out of interstitial space can be identified.
       A6.1.3.2. More familiar and simple gravity fill.
       A6.1.3.3. Fuel temperature more stable thus less vapor release to the atmosphere.
       A6.1.3.4. Industry choice (either single or double wall).
       A6.1.3.5. Less likely to overfill than tank in vault.
       A6.1.3.6. Large overfill could get into soil.
       A6.1.3.7. Piping in contact with the soil could corrode – need to take precautions. Note:
       preferred service station carrier piping does not contact soil.
       A6.1.3.8. Piping leaks could be less visible in non-service station applications.
       A6.1.3.9. Steel tanks could corrode.
       A6.1.3.10. Proper installation critical to success – use only experienced tank installer,
       consider expert inspector during installation.
       A6.1.3.11. Must have operating leak detection system.
       A6.1.3.12. May not be a good choice in areas with high water tables.
       A6.1.3.13. Requires environmental record keeping.
A6.2. When looking at life cycle costs, consider:
   A6.2.1. The recurring costs for testing and monitoring USTs.
   A6.2.2. The cost of monitoring piping systems, fuel dispensers, etc - applies to any system
   no matter what type tank is installed.
   A6.2.3. Possible repair costs for any of the types of tanks and possible clean-up costs.
   A6.2.4. Annual state and local regulatory costs, including costs of preparing permits, record
   keeping, and registration, permit, or other fees for the installation or operation of the tank.

  A6.2.5. Estimated cost of any fine that may result from noncompliance with Federal, state,
  or local requirements.
  A6.2.6. Consider that new USTs are built to different standards than those of the past and
  regulators and the industry do not see them as any riskier that other types of tanks.
