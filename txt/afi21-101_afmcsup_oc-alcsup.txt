evaluations and the quality organization does not have personnel with that expertise, SMEs and
augmentees from other organizations may be used. Group quality offices and production groups
will select qualified individuals as augmentees. Trained QA personnel will lead SMEs and
augmentees during any inspection or assessment.

8.10.8.8.36. (Added) Technical Order (TO) inspections accomplished by OC-ALC /OB
personnel on TO files will be input as Routine Inspection Listing (RIL) in Quality Information
Management Standard System (QIMSS) with the applicable rating and with OBWK control
numbers. For TO findings that are attributed to the work center, the AFMC IMT 343 will be sent
to the work center supervisor with an informational copy to the applicable group QA Chief.

8.10.9.4.14.1. (Added) Quality Escapes Reporting Process. Follow impoundment process in
Chapter 9. If required recall procedures are implemented by the Cognizant Engineer.

8.10.14.1.1. (Added) Supervision is required to notify the applicable group QA office when an
employee is initially certified for the purpose of performing Personnel Evaluations (PE)s. The
PE will be performed by a Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS) as soon as possible after the
employee’s initial certification.

8.10.14.1.1.1. (Added) PEs will be tracked in Training Scheduling System (TSS). Within three
working days of PAC certification, a PE course code will be loaded into the technician’s TSS
record.

8.10.14.1.1.2. (Added) When an employee fails a PE for workmanship, decertification of that
employee is required, preferably within one working day of the PE failure. The employee’s
supervisor is required to inform the applicable group QA upon recertification of the employee.
The following flow charts (8.1 and 8.2) define the process for tracking PEs and Enhanced
Personnel Evaluation (EPE)s in TSS.

8.11.15. (Added) The QIMSS assessments shall be maintained for a minimum of 10 years.
Consideration will be given to purging assessments older than 10 years based on space,
economic need and at the discretion of the QIMSS Software Manager and the Center
Administrator.

8.11.16. (Added) When an AFMC IMT 343 is issued, the following procedures will apply:

8.11.16.1. (Added) The Supervisor or designated official of the work center being evaluated will
be in briefed and out-briefed, if available. Additionally, the AFMC IMT 343 will be e-mailed to
the supervisor or responsible person as soon as possible using the e-mail client in the QIMSS.
Completed AFMC IMT 343 will be sent back to the issuing office for acceptance or rejection of
the finding within 10 workdays. The issuing office should check QIMSS daily for actions that
need accepting or rejecting. The issuing QA office has 5 workdays for acceptance or rejection of
the AFMC IMT 343 corrective/preventative action(s).

8.11.16.1.1. (Added) If the corrective action is rejected by the QAS, see Table 14.23.

8.11.16.1.2. (Added) If the QAS fails the Follow-Up Assessment, see Table 14.24.

8.11.17. (Added) Data analysis will be performed on all findings (OC-ALC Form 531, AFMC
IMT 343) on recurring basis (monthly, quarterly, and annually) to evaluate trends/systemic
issues across OC-ALC. If systemic issues are found, Complex/Group leadership shall determine
an appropriate root cause analysis response tool to develop countermeasures to ensure the root
cause is mitigated.
8.11.17.1. (Added) Trigger Points. Defect codes will be the first analysis level to determine
Systemic findings. Once like defect codes are grouped, each defect code grouping that exceeds
the trigger point will be read individually to ensure findings are similar.

 8.11.17.2. (Added) Criteria for trigger points. Findings in any given month exceeding five
percent of previous OC-ALC calendar year average defects per month or greater than 50% of
MXGs have similar issue (exceeding 3% of previous MXG calendar year monthly average) or
increased risk associated with identified finding (“e.g., damage to a part, injury to an employee,
etc…”).

8.11.17.3. (Added) Block 19 will not be required on AFMC IMT 343. If the AFMC IMT 343 is
deemed a trend/systemic, the Group Commander/Deputies will consider initiating an AFSO21 8-
step process. The AFSO21 8-step will be documented with an AFMC IMT 343. AFSO21 8-step
process document will serve as proof of compliance for this process.

8.11.17.4. (Added) At time of finding; a correction is required. If applicable, this correction
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                          21


should address existence of any additional nonconforming products and when required, further
action should be taken. Additionally, any correction should be evaluated for the need for action
based on human factors to ensure that nonconformities do not recur.

8.11.17.5. (Added) If an inspection fails due to exceeding the acceptable quality limit (AQL),
inspectors will keep each finding as a minor in block 11 (defect class) and change block 8
(assessment rating) to a QAR 3.

8.12.2.2.5. (Added) OC-ALC/QA shall serve as the focal point for the submissions of all AFTO
IMT 22 forms.

8.12.2.2.5.1. (Added) All AFTO IMT 22 forms shall be routed through the OC-ALC/QA
workflow for assignment of local control number and tracking.

8.12.2.2.5.2. (Added) All AFTO IMT 22 forms shall be complete (except for the control number)
and reviewed for technical accuracy prior to sending to the OC-ALC/QA workflow.

8.23.4.2.1. (Added) The Complex Quality Office, OC-ALC /QA, will perform trend analysis of
inspections, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), and defect codes by using QIMSS, Corrective Action
Tracking System (CATS), and other appropriate methods. The results of the trend analysis will
be reported to Complex senior leaders. The responsible group shall take appropriate action to
improve the product, process or service in order to eliminate the nonconformance. Continuous
improvement of the corrective action process will be made based on regular analysis of tracking
system data, the quality management review process and customer feedback.

8.23.17. (Added) Manage Complex QA Flash Program, an informative tool which may be
initiated as the result of a potential deficiency. The QA Flash is not a corrective action request
therefore no formal corrective action is necessary.

8.23.18. (Added) The QIMSS Complex Administrator serves as the primary focal point for the
OC-ALC and is appointed by the OC-ALC QA Focal Point (OC-ALC/QA). The Complex
Administrator is responsible for making decisions that affect all QIMSS users within the work
center. The duties of the Complex Administrator shall include:

8.23.18.1. (Added) Serves as the OC-ALC representative to the Headquarters (AFMC) QIMSS
working group.

8.23.18.2. (Added) Chairs the local QIMSS working group, as needed.

every 30 days.

8.24.6.1. (Added) Historical assessment data, customer satisfaction, and management direction
may be used to update and revise individual OC-ALC Group Quality Assurance Surveillance
Plan (QASP)s. If assessments consistently receive pass/fail ratings, the OC-ALC Group may

Example: Type, Model, Series (TMS, example F100) or Mission Design Series (MDS, example
B-1B)

14.38.5.1.1.2. (Added) When the work performed does not lend itself to this kind of task
definition, PAC tasks shall be structured to the nature of the service performed. This can be by
skill, equipment, type of service, or other logical breakdown.

14.38.5.1.1.3. (Added) SSQ tasks will be designated with the SSQ indicator.

14.38.5.1.1.4. (Added) PAC tasks may be established to document on the job training (OJT) and
certifications for work that does not require stamping a WCD such as operating a forklift or
operating an aerial lift however; all tasks must meet the task title criteria.

14.38.5.1.2. (Added) Auditable - The PAC task will provide a direct correlation to the WCD
entry.

14.38.5.1.2.1. (Added) The task must reflect conformance to standards by providing a link from
certified PAC task to applicable WCD. The WCD will reflect the applicable technical data
related to the task.

14.38.5.1.2.2. (Added) One of the primary goals of an audit is to determine if a person,
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                        45


organization, system, enterprise activity, project, process or product (etc,) in question, is meeting
standards and requirements.

Example: If the WCD states, “Remove F-15 Left Aileron”, the inspector must be able to identify
the task in the employee’s Section III of their PAC record. (The ability of the inspector to “audit”
the WCD task-to-training/certification relationship is what is being evaluated)

14.38.5.1.3. (Added) Trainable – Ability to instruct an employee on a single task that provides
the knowledge, skills and competencies to successfully perform a function IAW the applicable
technical data and other regulatory requirements.

14.38.5.1.3.1. (Added) Tasks must be structured to verify that the employee is properly trained
on the task.

Example: Task Title states “Manufacture, Repair, Assemble, Install or Overhaul Aircraft
Components In Shop”, this task is not trainable because there is no way for the employee to be
trained on all aircraft components. An Example of a trainable task is “Remove Over Wing
Escape Hatch on an E-3 Aircraft”. This is a trainable task because what the employee is being
trained on is specific to the weapon system and component. NOTE: There is no timeframe
required to personal identification number (PIN) a certified task. Employees cannot stamp off a
WCD until the PAC task is certified and PINed by the employee and the employee’s supervisor.
Additionally, due to varying complexity of tasks, there is no time frame required for OJT.

14.38.5.1.3.2. (Added) PAC Task Bundling. Bundling or placing multiple functions in a single
PAC task is authorized as long as the employee and supervisor can determine what requirements
the tasks were trained on (WCD, tech data, etc.). Bundled PAC tasks shall meet the PAC task
requirements to include the identifiable, auditable and trainable requirements identified in this
supplement.

14.38.5.1.3.3. (Added) Qualification Tasks. Qualification tasks are tasks that are used to track
training qualifications. They are not certification tasks. Qualification tasks are used to document
training qualifications that do not relate to a WCD, requires some type of OJT and a
demonstration of proficiency that the employee can perform the task. Qualification Tasks do not
have to meet the PAC task requirements as defined in this supplement, such as conforming to the
trainable, auditable or identifiable task requirements. Qualification tasks requirements will be
established in the OC-ALC Supplement to AFI 36-2232, AFMC Sup 1.

14.38.10.1. (Added) The maintenance employee mentioned in paragraph 14.38.10. is defined as
any maintenance technician assigned to the OC-ALC that is assigned one or more PAC tasks.

14.38.14.3. (Added) NOTE: There is no timeframe required to PIN a certified task. Employees
cannot stamp off a WCD until the PAC task is certified and PINed by the employee and the
employees supervisor. Additionally, due to varying complexity of tasks, there is no time frame
required for OJT.

14.38.16. (Added) Employee Bill of Rights. OC-ALC personnel shall be empowered to take
responsible actions that contribute to safety, quality, and productivity. To make this happen, the
 46                              AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013

the complete TO apply to all extracts.

14.41.31.1. (Added) Technical Data - Technical data is defined in public law as “…recorded
information (regardless of the form or method of recording) of a scientific or technical nature
(including software documentation) relating to supplies procured by an agency. Technical data
does not include computer software or financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management
data or other information incidental to contract administration.” This definition includes
engineering data, source data and TO data (for example, schematic diagrams, flow diagrams,
manufacturer handbooks, manuscripts of operations and maintenance (O&M) instructions,
preliminary technical orders (PTO)s, commercial technical manuals (TMs), research and
development (R&D) TMs, and other system or equipment O&M procedures developed under
AFMC or other acquisition agency directions during the system acquisition phase). Avoid use of
this term when referring to specific types of data.

14.41.31.1.1. (Added) TO - TMs developed to MILSPECs or commercial manuals reviewed and

hard copy, audio and visual displays, magnetic tape, disks, or other electronic devices).

14.41.31.1.3. (Added) Technical data will be controlled in all maintenance/operational areas but
is not managed in the TO system. NOTE: (Added) IAW TO 00-5-1, if color is critical to
understanding the TO data, local reproduction must be in color.

14.41.31.2. (Added) TO Extracts in Use at Work Stations: Verification of currency will be
accomplished once a day prior to extracts use. Extracts printed from hard copy TOs will be
verified against the ETIMS master TO report. Electronic TO extracts will be validated via the
site that the extracts were originally printed from.

14.41.31.2.1. (Added) Technical Data Extracts: Pages printed from 202s, Process Orders, and
Process Operation Sheets will have title pages and distribution sheets attached. Drawings or
blueprints printed from electronic sources will also require current revision data and distribution
statement printed and attached to the extracts.

14.41.31.2.2. (Added) Documenting TO Currency Verification: Write/stamp the verification date
and maintenance stamp or, if employee does not have a maintenance stamp, print and sign their
name on the front title page. The title page will be attached to the TO extract package.
Technicians will verify the TO title page is the latest basic/change number and date(s). If
applicable copies of active supplements, AFMC 202s, and special handling AFTO 252s will be
included with extract pages along with annotations to effected pages, control numbers will be
annotated to title page and treated as if a whole tech order IAW TO 00-5-1 and AFMCMAN 21-
1, chapter 5. If a different technician elects to use an extract he/she did not print, that individual
will assume responsibility for ensuring extract currency.

14.41.31.3. (Added) Previously Printed Extracts: The technician will draw a single line through
the previous verification on the title page and reaccomplish verification. If the currency of the
TO extract changed, dispose of the outdated extract.

14.41.31.4. (Added) TO Extracts not in use: First-level supervisors will designate a “centrally
located” storage area for the TO extract packages IAW TO 00-5-1 paragraph 7.6.3 to be stored at
end of shift/task. At no time will shop extracts be filed in the TO Libraries. The technician who
prints, verifies currency, and stamps the title page of the TO extract is responsible for ensuring
the extract is returned to the storage area after use or proper disposal if the extract is no longer
needed. If a technician elects to use tech order he or she did not print that individual assumes
responsibility for returning it to the storage area after use or proper disposal if the extract is no
longer needed.

14.41.31.5. (Added) Disposition: When the extract is no longer needed, it must be properly
disposed of. If the TO is marked “Unlimited Distribution” on the title page, it may be placed in
recycle or regular trash receptacles as a whole document. Proprietary and/or limited distribution
 60                              AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013


TOs will be shredded prior to disposal. Alternatively, proprietary and/or limited distribution TOs
may be consigned to a bonded recycling contractor who shreds or pulps the paper before resale.

14.41.31.6. TO. (Added) The supervisor or TO library monitors will review all TO extracts
within the organization during the first week of each month. Any TO extract that has not been
used during the previous month, as indicated by the daily in use review documented on the
extract title page, will be destroyed. NOTE: (Added) If TOs are not available by any other
media or means, the using organization may submit an AFTO Form 187 to request the contractor
TODO establish ID for a single copy of a TO per library that will be utilized to copy extracts.

14.41.31.7. (Added) Blue Prints and Mylar Prints. For this media there will be no expiration
date for destruction unless the media is unserviceable or superseded by an updated version of the
media.

14.41.31.8. (Added) Storage of Blue Prints and Mylar Prints. It will be the shop supervisor’s
responsibility to designate a storage area (as applicable) for blue prints and mylar prints when
not in use, to include blue prints that travel with parts routed between shops.

14.41.31.9. (Added) Handling of Mylar Prints. In order to maintain the life of the media the
following handling procedures will be used:

14.41.31.9.1. (Added) Mylar prints will not be rolled less than 3 inches inside diameter.

14.41.31.9.2. (Added) Avoid exposing the media to heat generating sources. This affects the
dimensional stability of the media.

14.41.31.9.3. (Added) Do not fold, crease or damage in anyway. This also affects the
dimensional stability.

14.41.31.10. (Added) Storage of Mylar Prints. Undimensioned drawings shall be stored in an
environmentally controlled area due to the effect of temperature and humidity on the media. The
target value for temperature shall be 68°F (20°C) with a relative humidity of 50%. Compensation
must be made for measurements made at other temperatures and humidity to ensure integrity of
the data presented. Contact engineering for specific guidance instructions on measurement
compensation.

14.41.32. (Added) MXSG Responsibility, “Report of Notification for TO Changes.” Each
maintenance group will identify a single POC and at least one alternate who will receive the list
of technical data changes published by the contractor TODO. NOTE: The OPR will distribute
appropriate portions, or as a whole, the technical data change list to planners, engineers, and
production personnel. This will be accomplished within 3 workdays following receipt of the list,
as this function is critical.

14.41.32.1. (Added) The OPR will retain a dated copy of each list received from the contractor
for 2 years. Upon redistribution of the list, the appropriate production personnel and subordinate
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                        61


planners will retain a copy along with verification of receipt. This verification can be in the form
of an e-mail response. Timeliness is important since the contractor TODO shall perform the
actual updates to the libraries within 5 workdays of publishing the notification list.

14.41.32.2. (Added) Planning personnel will update the WCDs to match the tech order changes
upon receipt of the change notice from the contractor TODO. The technical data change list will
be annotated by the planner to provide evidence that the review and update was accomplished.

14.41.32.2.1. (Added) The notification to the production personnel will be distributed in a format
that will serve as a log sheet to record actual notification to the using mechanic(s). The
production foreman or TO monitor will review the list to determine which tech order changes
apply to their operations and pass on the notification to all impacted mechanics. The notification
will be recorded on the log sheet and filed for subsequent verification audit purposes.

14.41.32.2.2. (Added) Production will be responsible for passing the tech order notifications to
the applicable personnel within their shop within 1 day of receipt of notification for the
applicable employees. Those who are absent will be notified the day they return to work. The
shop supervisor or TO monitor will annotate the notification on the update list, which will be
provided in a format to serve as a log sheet. Production will maintain a file of the tech order
change notifications for 2 years as evidence of accomplishment and to respond to audits of the
notification process.

14.41.33. (Added) Organizational Responsibility for Requesting Classified TO. Classified tech
order will be requested separately from unclassified tech order, via written memo along with an
AFTO Form 187, to the contractor TODOs. When classified tech orders are to be added to an
existing library, the memo will include the safe number (e.g., TI-17), the name of the safe
custodian who will be responsible for accepting the TOs, and a brief justification describing the
requester’s need. The organizational branch chief will sign the memo, verifying safe custodians
have appropriate security clearance.


14.41.34. (Added) The production supervisor will provide access to digital tech data through
coordination with the TODO. In order to be granted access to digital Tech Orders, including
portable eTools, users are required to submit a DD Form 2875 System Authorization Access
Request and be approved. Computers designated "for training use only" are exempt from this
DD Form 2875 requirement, allowing users to be trained in eTO/eTool usage without an
approved DD Form 2875.

14.41.35. (Added) E-Tools are defined as electronic devices such as Ruggedized laptops, tablets,
and associated peripheral items (batteries, cords, etc.), which are used to view electronic
technical data. Technical data accessed on the device is considered current and applicable for
use by the technician, providing the device has been properly docked daily allowing the TODO
synchronization to take place. For inventory control purposes, the device will be treated as a tool
in accordance with chapter 10 of the OC-ALC SUP TO AFI 21-101, AFMC SUP, AFI 23-111,
AFMAN 23-220, and OC-ALC 21-112. This will allow for accountability in the event the eTool
is lost, stolen, or damaged in a way that might allow pieces to be at risk of becoming lost in, on,
 62                               AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013


or around an aircraft or component.

14.41.35.1. (Added) Damage and abuse of eTools will be identified and resolved in accordance
with chapter 10 of the OC-ALC SUP TO AFI 21-101, AFMC SUP, AFI 23-111, AFMAN 23-
220, and OC-ALC 21-112. Each technician is required to sign an AFMC Form 311, Certificate
of Responsibility for Government Property, upon initial tool kit issue at Tinker AFB. This form
binds each technician to their responsibility concerning all tools. Historical records obtained
through CAC (Computer Access Card) cabinet control software may be used to identify who has
checked out any specific e-Tool. Technicians that are not issued tool kits may not have signed an
AFMC Form 311; however, they will be held to the same responsibility and accountability for
eTools in accordance with AFI 23-111 Para 2 and this OC-ALC SUP TO AFI 21-101.

14.41.35.2. (Added) Lost tool/item procedures apply to e-Tools in accordance with OC-ALC 21-
112. Historical records obtained through CAC cabinet control software will be used to identify
last user.

14.41.35.3. (Added) TODO shall report to area supervisor if eTool is not returned at end of each
shift. Responsible production supervisors are required to inventory all eTools at the end of their
shift.

14.41.35.4. (Added) Supervisors will ensure employees are familiar with all requirements
outlined in paragraph 14.41.38.2 of this section and they are fully trained in the use of the cabinet
as well as checkout/check-in procedures.

14.41.35.5. (Added) By using a CAC card to gain access to an eTool, technician assumes
responsibility for eTool and all associated items within its assigned drawer to include the power
cable, CAT-5 cable, etc. which are zip tied and not intended for removal. In the event the zip tie
becomes damaged or removed, it is the responsibility of the technician to report it to the
supervisor and replace the tie.

14.41.35.5.1. (Added) When returning eTools after use or at the end of shift, technicians must
“Log Off” the device and reconnect power and LAN cables so the eTools can be updated and
fully charged for the next user.

14.41.36. (Added) Technicians may check-out an eTool for an extended period of time (longer
than one shift) however; technicians must have the production supervisor complete an AF Form
1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, prior to eTool removal. The completed AF Form 1297 will be
placed in the eTool assigned cabinet drawer location. The drawer will be disabled through the
controller software for the duration annotated on the AF Form 1297.

14.41.36.1. (Added) Technicians assuming responsibility for an eTool for an extended period,
must validate currency of the tech data daily. If authorized internet access is available, the
technician shall manually sync the eTool. If this can’t be accomplished, the technician must
verify revision dates against online viewers, or by contacting their supervisor or TODO to see if
any revision has occurred to specific required tech data. It will be the technician’s responsibility
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     63


to obtain current tech data elsewhere if eTool tech data becomes outdated.

14.41.36.2. (Added) Only a supervisor may check out more than one eTool at a time for any
reason. The supervisor will coordinate with the TODO to check out eTools completing an AF
Form 1297 for each device to be used per method above.

14.41.37. (Added) All keys, spare batteries, spare power cables and other accessories related to
eTools will be stored in the Tool Crib/Production Support Center (PSC) and checked out as
needed. If an employee is issued an accessory, such as a power cord, it must be clearly marked in
accordance with directives and placed on the OC-ALC Form 539, Maintenance Tool Add-On
Authorization List, per OC-ALCI 21-112, paragraph 13.1.1.1. The TODO must be notified in all
instances where a cabinet will be accessed by keys as opposed to CAC card. Keys will only be
checked out by TODOs, eTool CSAs (Computer Support Administrator) and production
supervisors. The responsible TODO will always be the preferred person to manually check-in or
out eTools. If a production supervisor accesses CAC cabinets using the key, he/she must notify
the TODO within 1 hour of the occurrence, so the TODO can update controller software
accordingly. Email is an acceptable form of notification. TODO POC information is posted on
each cabinet.

14.41.37.1. (Added) Contingency plan for TO access in the event of cabinet malfunction:

14.41.37.1.1. (Added) When cabinets are inoperable due to power failures etc., supervisors in
coordination with the responsible TODO, will use manual procedures to issue eTools.
Supervisors will check out cabinet keys from the tool crib/PSC and issue eTools using an AF
Form 1297. An AF Form 1297 is to be completed for each device checked out. If the TODO is
unavailable, the supervisor can perform manual procedures, but must notify responsible TODO
within 1 hour after occurrence. Email is an acceptable form of notification.

14.41.37.1.2. (Added) Exception: A supervisor may be given authority to maintain a key to the
eTool cabinet under special circumstances, only with squadron level approval in writing.

14.41.37.1.2.1. (Added) After gaining squadron approval, the key must be issued on an AF Form
1297. The supervisor receiving the key is only authorized to utilize it in the event that the
TODO is not available and the cabinet is inoperable due to power failure, system failure, etc. If a
production supervisor accesses CAC cabinets using the key, he/she must notify the TODO within
one hour of the occurrence so the TODO can update the controller software accordingly. Email is
an acceptable form of notification.

14.41.37.2. (Added) Technicians may share eTools by using multiple windows to display tech
data. This will be considered “Open and In Use” and “In Accordance With” but should be
limited to a maximum of seven technicians. “Open and In Use” requirement and definition is
dictated by OC-ALC SUP TO AFI 21-101, AFMC SUP, Chap 19.

14.41.38. (Added) Summary of Responsibilities:

Chapter 15 – Maintaining Commercial Derivative Aircraft


15.1. (Added) Background Information and Objective. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
type certification is the preferred method of certifying airworthiness of AF operated commercial
derivative aircraft (CDA). This method is appropriate when the military usage is no more severe
than the FAA certified flight envelope and usage environment. Depot maintenance activities to
AF CDA having FAA certification shall not cause the aircraft to lose its FAA certification. To
meet this requirement, all depot maintenance shall be performed in an FAA 14 CFR Part 145
Repair Station or in a military repair facility that has been deemed “equivalent” to the Part 145
standard by the FAA.


15.6. (Added) Certification Requirements. Maintenance technicians perform maintenance on
CDA under the authority of the FAA 14 CFR Part 145 Repair Station certificate thus they are not
individually required to have an airframe, powerplant, or repairman certificate. Only those
individuals authorized to return the repaired item (aircraft, engine, accessory) to service shall be
certificated. Individuals with return to service authority will issue return to service
documentation (Certificate of Conformance or AF letter) in accordance with the FAA approved
Repair Station Manual/Quality Control Manual.


15.7. (Added) Inspection Requirements. All depot maintenance processes and procedures shall
be in accordance with FAA approved inspection requirements and all applicable technical data
and/or TO. Refer to the FAA approved Repair Station Manual/Quality Control Manual for more
detailed guidance.


15.7.1. (Added) Maintenance Release Documentation.


15.7.1.1. (Added) KC-10 Aircraft. The KC-10 uses a return to service letter (official
memorandum with OC-ALC letterhead) to document all completed work and release the aircraft
back to the customer. This letter can either recommend the aircraft be returned to service or
release the aircraft for restricted flight back to home station or a contract depot facility for
 66                               AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013


additional repair. The letter shall be signed by an approved authority that is listed on the return
to service roster maintained in the OC-ALC Repair Station office and who also has either an
FAA Airframe & Powerplant (A&P), Airframe only, or Repairman certificate.


15.7.1.2. (Added) F-117 Engine. The F-117 uses a Certificate of Conformance (CoC) to
document all maintenance performed in the heavy maintenance center and applicable backshops.
It documents when an item has been repaired in accordance with the applicable WCD/work
order. There are three different types of CoC’s – Backshop, Engine Repair Without Test Run,
and Return to Service.


15.7.1.2.1. (Added) Backshop Certification of Conformance (CoC) . When an F-117 item is sent
to a backshop for repair, a PMXG Form 231, Certification of Conformance, is required to
document the maintenance action/repair that was performed. This document is signed by a
technician that is authorized to perform work in the OC-ALC Repair Station. For the backshop
CoC, the technician is not required to be an FAA certificated technician (A&P, Powerplant only,
or Repairman certificate).


15.7.1.2.2. (Added) Engine Repair Without Test Run CoC. When an F-117 engine has been
repaired and is released back to the contractor without having accomplished an engine
performance test run, this CoC is required (official memorandum with OC-ALC letterhead). It
documents the depot maintenance that was accomplished and specifically states that the engine
was not tested and it is not released back to service. The CoC shall be signed by an approved
authority that has an FAA A&P, Powerplant only, or Repairman certificate and is listed on the
return to service roster. This roster is maintained in the OC-ALC Repair Station office. Upon
contractor acceptance of the engine, it is the responsibility of the contractor to perform the test
run at another facility and return the engine to service under their authority.


15.7.1.2.3. (Added) Return to Service CoC. After the F-117 engine has been repaired and
successfully completed all engine performance test runs, it is released back to the contractor
using the return to service CoC (official memorandum with OC-ALC letterhead). This CoC
documents the depot maintenance that was accomplished and specifically states that the engine
was successfully tested and it is recommended for return to service. The CoC shall be signed by
an approved authority that has an FAA A&P, Powerplant only, or Repairman certificate and is
listed on the return to service roster. This roster is maintained in the OC-ALC Repair Station
office.

19.2.16.6.3. (Added) In cases of incomplete work at end of shift, sufficient documentation will
be provided by the off-going shift supervisor or wage leader to ensure the work, when continued,
will not require unnecessary re-accomplishment of previous tasks. Tasks not completed due to
end of shift will be documented in accordance with group carryover procedures.

19.2.16.6.4. (Added) The outbound supervisor or wage leader can describe the completed work
in a type of log or shift book. If log or shift books are used they will be maintained as official
records IAW AF instructions. This should list the steps completed by the technicians on that
shift. The entries should be stamped by the technician who completed the task either in a type of
log book or on the back/bottom of the WCD. The technician who subsequently completes the
task will certify completion by properly stamping and dating the WCD task in the appropriate
certification block. This method can be used or adapted to meet specific group needs.

19.2.16.6.5. (Added) If the follow-on technician is unable to appraise the work already
completed, the shift supervisor or wage leader will determine how to proceed. Some of the
options are as follows:

19.2.16.6.5.1. (Added) Contact worker who performed original work on the operation/sub-
operation.

19.2.16.6.5.2. (Added) Rework that portion of the operation in question.

19.5.2. (Added) Maintaining Stocks of Stamps.


19.5.2.1. (Added) Each group will appoint a group stamp monitor(s) in writing. It will be the
responsibility of the group stamp monitor to oversee the procurement, issue, and control of
stamps in accordance with this instruction and higher directives.


19.5.2.1.1. (Added) Group stamp monitor must use TSS/PAC to issue, turn-in, manage, maintain
and conduct the annual inventory for all maintenance stamps. 19.5.2.1.2. Stamps issued to
PMEL contractors shall use locally devised system to manage stamp inventory.


19.5.2.2. (Added) The stamp monitor will be required annually to oversee an inventory of their
stamp stock available and stamps in use for the purpose of accountability and legibility. They
will each maintain a list of current stamps issued to their organization for review. The review
will include screening the stamp for legibility and the stamp list for omission of employees
possessing stamps and/or employees listed who have turned in their stamps. Each employee will
legibly stamp the inventory list. Supervisor will take immediate action to correct any
discrepancies identified during the review IAW paragraph 19.5.1. Supervisor’s comments may
be annotated on the stamp listing. Stamp monitor will verify listing for correctness of current
status to the OC-ALC Form 800, (active, lost, destroyed, inactive, etc.), and a current copy of the
 76                                AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013


stamp list or electronic database. Stamp monitor will notify the appropriate squadron by email of
any discrepancies identified during inventory procedure for immediate corrective action. In
addition, this review will verify that stamps have not been misplaced/mislabeled. Supervisors
will review PAC/Electronic Training Records (ETR) against the stamp listing to validate stamp
authorization, requirements, and issue. Records of these reviews will be maintained for
accountability purposes until the completion of the next annual review.


19.5.3. (Added) Issue of Stamps. Following is the procedure for the issuance of stamps within
each group:


19.5.3.1. (Added) Stamps will be issued upon receipt of a letter from the first-line supervisor to
the group stamp monitor. This is only required on initial issue of a specific type of stamp to an
individual unless the individual’s stamp was turned in for one of the reasons stated in paragraph
19.5.1.4.


19.5.3.2. (Added) Upon determination that an individual requires and is qualified for possession
of a particular type of stamp, the applicable first-line supervisor will initiate and sign a letter that
will be forwarded to the appropriate group office for stamp issuance. PMXG will use PMXG
Form 234. Only one individual per request letter and it must be hand-carry to the appropriate
group office by the employee. The stamp monitor will ensure the employee requesting the stamp
has not been issued the same type stamp previously without having an AFMC Form 310,
Lost/Found Item Report, on file. NOTE: (Added) Civilians must present a valid Department of
the Air Force Civilian Identification Card prior to stamp issue. Military personnel must present a
valid Armed Forces of the United States Geneva Convention Identification Card prior to stamp
issue.


19.5.3.3. (Added) The appropriate group stamp monitor will complete and maintain an OC-ALC
Form 800 for all stamps issued, see Table 14.19. The letter will state the individual who is to
receive the stamp has been indoctrinated in the care and responsibilities of the possession of the
stamp IAW AFI 21-101, AFMC Sup 1 and this instruction. The letter should state the name of
the individual, and their middle initial (if they have no middle initial, use “No MI,” where the
middle initial would appear), the employees routing symbol, phone number, employee D number
or last four of Social Security Number, and type of stamp required. For “N” stamps, the “skills
block” of the form will reflect the non-destructive testing process for which the stamp is issued.
The employee’s signature will signify receipt of the stamp as indicated by the declaration
statement appearing on the form.


19.5.3.4. (Added) Stamps turned in as prescribed in paragraph 19.5.4 and 19.5.5 and stamps
reported lost or stolen and subsequently recovered, will be returned to the appropriate group
stamp monitor for return to inventory and will not be reissued for a period of at least 60 days.
Numbers assigned to stamps, which are not recovered, may be procured and reissued only after a
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       77


period of at least 1-year.


19.5.4. (Added) Revocation of Stamps.


19.5.4.1. (Added) Revocation Due To Administrative Cause. Maintenance stamps may be
recalled due to administrative reasons and not due to any fault of the employee. One reason for
recall of maintenance stamps may be the need to replace a series of older stamps with a new
series of stamps.


19.5.4.2. (Added) Revocation Due To Adverse Cause. Maintenance stamps may be withdrawn
due to improper use of the stamps in violation of this written procedure, and/or higher directives,
or when there is a verifiable deterioration of an employee’s knowledge and/or demonstrated
proficiency or quality of work. Probable cause may result from supervisor’s observations,
customer complaints, and final functional tests. Focus will always be placed on identifying the
root cause of the problem and on the retraining of the employee, not on the punishment of the
employee. Revocation of the issue of a stamp will be by written authority of the appropriate first-
line supervisor.


19.5.4.2.1. (Added) The act of changing or withdrawing any stamp will require the employee’s
PAC/ETR record to be amended if the employee is under the PAC program. It will be necessary
to amend the employee’s PAC/ETR record to document the reason(s) for the change or
withdrawal of the maintenance stamp. Decertification and recertification criteria are discussed in
AFI 21-101, AFMC SUP 1.


19.5.4.3. (Added) Recall of maintenance stamps will be accomplished by a letter, signed by the
group stamp monitor, and will provide instructions on which stamps are to be recalled and
furnish all details necessary for implementation.


19.5.5. (Added) Turn In and Replacement of Stamps.


19.5.5.1. (Added) Employee will be responsible for returning all stamps issued to them to the
appropriate group stamp monitor. Reasons for returning stamps include: termination of
employment, transfer, or loan from the assigned group, failure to maintain required certification
status, or at any time the duties of the employee no longer require use of the stamp for the
purpose issued. First-line supervisors will be responsible for notifying the appropriate stamp
monitor immediately by email on the return of any employee stamps and may be required to
return the stamps in the absence of the employee. The stamp monitor will issue a receipt to the
employee when the stamp is turned in. The group personnel manager will notify the applicable
stamp monitor monthly of any movement of employees within or out of the group. Exception:
 78                              AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013


The AMXG stamp monitor is to be notified monthly of employee movement into or out of
production/quality flight. This will enable the stamp monitor to notify the former work center
supervisor by email if a stamp has not been returned for proper disposition.


19.5.5.2. (Added) When an employee leaves the assigned group for whatever reason, the
employee will turn in the stamp to the appropriate stamp monitor. If the employee transfers
within the same group to a different flight or squadron, the former supervisor will be responsible
for notifying the stamp monitor of the new organization where the employee is being transferred.
Exception: AMXG employees transferring or loaned to a different production/quality flight
within the group will be responsible for returning their stamp to the stamp monitor.


19.5.5.3. (Added) When the group stamp monitor receives a returned stamp, they will remove
the applicable OC-ALC Form 800 from the active file and complete the “date returned” and
“received by” blocks of the form in the presence of the employee. The stamp monitor will issue a
receipt to the employee when the stamp is turned in. The returned stamp will not be reissued for
at least 60 days.


19.5.5.4. (Added) For replacement of worn or illegible stamps, a OC-ALC Form 800 will be
prepared in the same manner as prescribed for the initial issue of stamps. The worn or illegible
stamp must be turned in as prescribed in AFI 21-101, AFMC Sup paragraph 19.5.1 prior to the
issuance of a new stamp. A new letter for stamp issuance is required for replacement stamps.
(PMXG will use PMXG Form 234).


19.5.5.5. (Added) If the employee loses a maintenance stamp while at the job site, the loss of the
maintenance stamp will be reported using lost tool procedures for a lost item IAW OC-ALCI 21-
101. If the stamp is lost away from the job site, the AFMC Form 310 will require signature at the
section supervisory level; block 11A and a new stamp may be issued at this time. The loss of the
maintenance stamp must be reported as soon as discovered. Issuance for replacement of lost or
stolen stamps will be accomplished after the designated management representative, as
prescribed in OC-ALCI 21-101, clears the AFMC Form 310. AFMC Form 310 will be retained
for at least 2 years after annotation is made.


19.5.6. (Added) Destruction of unserviceable Stamps. The appropriate group stamp monitor will
assure that unserviceable stamps are destroyed or mutilated to the extent that the stamp number
imprint is no longer legible. Any practicable means may be used for destruction of the stamps.


19.5.7. (Added) Procurement of New/Replacement Stamps.


19.5.7.1. (Added) Drawings (a blueprint of each type of stamp) may be obtained from a stamp
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    79


manufacturer. All stamps will be of a size as to not obliterate any other stamp or information on
the WCD.


19.5.7.2. (Added) Design of the stamps shall be within the parameters defined in AFI 21-101,
AFMC Sup 1. Purchase of the stamps will be accomplished through local complex purchasing
procedures. The stamps may be purchased using the Government Purchase Card (GPC)
procedures, if permitted by local group purchasing instructions.


19.5.8. (Added) Electronic Stamps. Electronic maintenance stamps may be utilized when they
become available. Details will be defined in this instruction at that time.


19.5.9. (Added) Maintenance of Stamp Records.


19.5.9.1. (Added) The group stamp monitor will maintain records of all stamps issued using the
OC-ALC Form 800, which will be kept in an appropriate file and updated in TSS accordingly.
Stamps issued to PMEL contractors shall use a locally devised system to manage stamp
inventory. The group stamp monitor will update TSS at least monthly. Supervisors will ensure
the group stamp monitor is immediately notified by email of any changes to stamp holders status
for updating TSS. When a stamp is turned in, withdrawn, recalled, or reported lost or stolen.
TSS will be updated and OC-ALC Form 800 annotated and transferred to the appropriate file.
The file may be maintained either numerically or chronologically, whichever method is most
suitable.


19.5.9.2. (Added) The OC-ALC Form 800 is designed for repetitive issue of a stamp bearing the
same number. When all spaces on the form have been used, and upon subsequent issue, the form
will be stapled to the back of a new OC-ALC Form 800 and will be kept for 1 year after the life
of the stamp.


19.5.9.3. (Added) Annual Reviews. The annual review of all stamps will consist of the inventory
stamp list and stamp records, which will be accomplished IAW paragraph 19.5.1. Annual
reviews will be maintained by stamp monitors until the completion of the next annual review and
will be available for review upon request.


19.5.10. (Added) Special Processes.


19.5.10.1. (Added) OC-ALC Technical Director along with the supporting group chief engineer,
is responsible for identifying all maintenance processes considered to be special. Table 14.15
identifies special processes in OC-ALC. Any additions or deletions to this list must be
 80                              AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OCALCSUP 22 NOVEMBER 2013


coordinated with the OC-ALC Technical Director.

19.5.10.2. (Added) Current and future process orders (PO) that fall under special processes
identified on Table 14.15 are authorized for use provided the cognizant engineering authority has
approved their use and the production planning team has concurred the data is valid for
performing the required work. Each group engineering office will be responsible to maintain a
current listing of all process orders. This list will address at a minimum: PO number, title, last
review data, organization, number of pages, does it fall under a special process, does it
compromise form/fit/function of the part, and does it require cognizant engineering approval.

19.5.11. (Added) Obsolete Forms Referenced. Air Force Form 7 and OC-ALC Form 8.

NOTE: For 76 AMXG/PMXG Table 14.19 is an example of how PQDR WCDs may be
developed. The 76 CMXG uses planning documents for the investigation and repair of
workmanship failures. If investigation reveals a non-workmanship failure, the item is wash
posted to the “A” job designated control number for repair.




If no defect is found then the scheduler will sell asset to supply on the QN2195 screen “A” condition.
NOTE: This will auto fill to condition code “F”
