Personnel Requirements. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) applies to Total Force – Active Duty,
Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard (ANG), and Department of Air Force Civilian. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

(AFMC) This supplement implements and extends guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI)
36-2201, Air Force Training Program. The AFI is published word-for-word without editorial
review. This supplement describes AFMC‘s procedures for use in conjunction with the basic
AFI. This supplement supersedes information originally contained in AFMCI 36-201 Chapter 11
and Attachment 2, dated 10 July 2003. The remainder of AFMCI 36-201 was superseded by AFI
36-401, AFMC Supplement 1. It applies to all units in AFMC that develop courses using the Air
Force Instructional Systems Design process. It does not apply to the Air Force Reserve or Air
National Guard (ANG). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional‘s
chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) on the AF Portal:
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changed reference in para 4.4.1.4.3 to AF/A1DL as the receiver of unfunded requirements to
HQ AF/A1PT because these requirements go to the PEMs who are located in AF/A1PT.

Instances of ―AF/A3O-A‖ as the authority for training exemptions for Tiers 2 and 3 training need
to be replaced by ―ACC/A3O‖ in order to fully comply with GFM responsibility realignment
directed by PAD 07-13. Although PAD 07-13 directed this change, the governing document AFI
36-2201 needs to reflect this transfer of responsibility.

Increased requirement to have AF members trained on arrival to short tour overseas assignments
in USAFE and PACAF theaters required changing existing funding policy for several categories
of enroute training. The change to AFI 36-2201 places TD TDY responsibility under one
umbrella (AETC's TD Student Travel Program) and creates a one-stop shop for TD training.

Delete inaccurate hyperlink references in 8.4.2 and 8.4.2.1 and add hands on training because
CBT is not the only avenue for Tier 2A training.

Correct wording in para 8.4.2.2; change ―waived‖ to ―exempted‖ because the requirement is not
actually waived.

Add a statement to clarify pre-deployment training management for general officers and civilian
equivalent because these members do not attend CAST.

Correct wording ―Waiver Applies‖ to ―Exemption Applies‖ in Attachment 15 and at the bottom
of the page 192.

Correct paragraph reference to A19.5.

                                             Chapter 1

                              CONTINUUM OF LEARNING (CoL)

1.1. Description. Developing Airmen is a top Air Force (AF) priority and developmental
efforts are key to the AF‘s ability to provide warfighting assets to combatant commanders. These
Airmen must possess the right combinations of both occupational and institutional competencies.
AF developmental efforts span a career and are referred to as a CoL. It applies to all Airmen–
civilian and military, officer and enlisted, active duty, Guard, and reserve components.
1.2. Force Development (FD). Force Development is a function of education, training, and
experience, which produces adaptive, creative, knowledge-enabled Airmen. Total FD is designed
to be dynamic and deliberate. It depends on underlying processes that integrate and synchronize
institutional requirements and senior leader perspectives. FD processes are facilitated by inputs
from functional communities, commanders, and individual members, but must remain focused
on delivering institutional AF requirements. The CoL allows the AF to synchronize force
development using defined requirements.
1.3. Competencies. One key portion of the requirements, the part that touches all Airmen, is
captured in the Institutional Competency List (ICL), found in AFPD 36-26, Total Force
Development. The ICL serves to provide a common taxonomy underlying the CoL and to
promote consistency AF-wide. All occupational models that include institutional competencies
appearing on the ICL should use the labels and definitions contained in the ICL. Airmen increase
their proficiency in all competencies through AF FD programs that include any combination of
education, training and/or experience. These programs should build on each other throughout the
course of a career. AF developmental activities provide an opportunity to serve and excel,
maintain promotion opportunity, and balance depth and breadth of experiences to AF
requirements.
1.4. Expected Benefits:
     1.4.1. Aligns infrastructure investments that are replicated across the AF (i.e. systems,
     process definition, training, and maintenance).
     1.4.2. Enables management to better assess, track, and defend development costs for the
     Total Force.
     1.4.3. Enables the AF to transition to a smaller force, should that be required, that is able to
     expand its capabilities to better support the mission(s).
     1.4.4. Enables an AF-wide strategic FD framework to determine workforce projections,
     current and future competency gaps, and emergent human capital needs.
     1.4.5. Provides a common language and results in clearer understanding of AF FD programs
     and initiatives, resulting in greater management efficiencies.
     1.4.6. Provides a standard foundation for determining requirements and standards for FD.
     1.4.7. More clearly identifies career paths for all Airmen with defined attainable steps.
     1.4.8. Provides Airmen a clearer vision of goals and expectations and an understanding of
     what their performance is measured against.

1.5. Impact of CoL on Continuum of Training. Based on the expected outcomes above, the
CoL will standardize the requirements for FD. This will enable the AF structure to reduce
unnecessary duplication within the training process, minimize ancillary training demands, clarify
the requirements process, and establish a common training evaluation baseline.

                                            Chapter 2

                       TRAINING DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY

2.1. AF Instructional Systems Design (ISD):
     2.1.1. The ISD process provides a systematic approach to planning, developing, and
     implementing training and education. The goal of ISD is to increase the effectiveness and
     cost efficiency of training by: developing instruction based on job performance requirements;
     eliminating irrelevant skills and knowledge instruction from courses; and ensuring graduates
     acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to do the job.
     2.1.2. The product of the ISD process is an instructional system that is cost effective and
     produces personnel who can do the job.
     2.1.3. ISD Source Documents. AFH 36-2235, Information for Designers of Instructional
     Systems, Volumes 1-13, outlines how AF personnel implement the ISD process. Related ISD
     publications are AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development, AFMAN 36-2236,
     Guidebook for AF Instructors, and AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
     Systems. Each command provides additional guidance.
     2.1.4. Responsibilities:
        2.1.4.1. MAJCOM. NOTE: The term MAJCOM, when used in this publication, refers to
        all Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), DRU, ANG, and
        AFRC unless otherwise indicated. Additional MAJCOM responsibilities may exist within
        each functional area of this AFI.
            2.1.4.1.1. Ensure subordinate organizations apply the ISD process to all types and
            phases of training, development and management.
                2.1.4.1.1.1. Formal Technical Training Course Types. The 15 types of formal
                training described in paragraphs 2.1.4.1.1.1.1 through 2.1.4.1.1.1.15 are used
                singly or in varying combinations to meet Air Force training needs.
                    2.1.4.1.1.1.1. Type 1, Special Contract Training. One-time or limited nature;
                    contracted with civilian industrial or educational institutions; includes
                    commercial off-the-shelf courses; normally used to train selected personnel to
                    operate and maintain new systems. Often personnel in training are initial cadre
                    and AETC instructors who, upon completion of Type 1 training, return to their
                    technical training wing (TRW) or training group (TRG) to develop AETC
                    courses. See AETCI 36-2219, Type 1 Training, for specific information.
                    2.1.4.1.1.1.2. Type 2, AETC Special Training. Formal training of a one-time
                    or limited (1 year or less) nature; conducted by AETC instructors at an Air
                    Force base, other military location, or contractor's location; normally used to
                    train personnel to operate and maintain new weapons or systems. Type 2
                    courses require all course control documents (POI part I and II, Course Chart,
                    Course Training Standards, measurement plan, and measurement devices).
                    They do not require a CTP, and can be used to rapidly stand up a course when
                    in house resources are available.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          9


             2.1.4.1.1.1.3. Type 3, Resident Regular Training. AFS-centered training of a
             continuing nature; conducted at an AETC base, location, or station. It includes
             courses designed for initial training, retraining from one AFS to another,
             training on special or new equipment and procedures, advancement within an
             AFS, and initial skill multi-phased AFSC awarding courses.
             2.1.4.1.1.1.4. Type 4, Field Training. Technical training conducted at
             operational locations may be delivered by a field training detachment (FTD)
             or a field training team (FTT). The FTD mission is to qualify personnel on
             new equipment and in new techniques and procedures, increase personnel
             skill and knowledge, acquaint personnel with specific systems, keep personnel
             up to date on training concepts and requirements, and maintain individuals at
             given proficiency levels. An FTD may use the area concept to provide direct
             training support. This concept provides field training to more than one base,
             location or station using the capability of a single FTD. FTTs are teams of
             FTD instructors who conduct training at an operational base using that base‘s
             facilities. Mobile training sets may be used. Teams normally include trainers,
             training aids, and operational equipment designed for field use but used to
             support maintenance training.
             2.1.4.1.1.1.5. Type 5, Training by Other U.S. Government Agencies
             (Excludes Interservice Training Review Organizations [ITRO]). Not
             consolidated, collocated or an executive agent; is conducted by an Army,
             Navy, Air Force agency or unit other than AETC, or other government
             agencies inside or outside of the Department of Defense (DoD).
             2.1.4.1.1.1.6. Type 6, Distance Learning. Formal training developed by a
             TRW, TRG, or a contractor; for export to students at bases of assignment;
             designed for students to learn without AETC course-qualified instructor on-
             site expertise.
             2.1.4.1.1.1.7. Type 7, Mobile Training Team (MTT). AETC instructors from
             organizations that typically provide Types 2, 3 and 7 training, who conduct
             training at an operational base using that base‘s facilities. Mobile training sets
             may be used, and usually consist of trainers, training aids, and operational
             equipment designed for field use but used to support training.
             2.1.4.1.1.1.8. Type 8, ITRO. Consolidated course with the Air Force as lead
             service. Course faculty includes fair share instructor representation from
             participating services and the host service, and usually a mixture of service
             personnel who teach the course.
             2.1.4.1.1.1.9. Type 9, ITRO. Consolidated course with another service as
             lead. Course faculty includes fair share instructor representation from
             participating services and the host service, and usually a mixture of service
             personnel who teach the course.

            course on an Air Force installation.
            2.1.4.1.1.1.14. Type W, Wartime Training Course. Course focus is on
            different tasks and/or equipment trained for a wartime scenario; the wartime
            version of a course will have a different course number and require a separate
            build in the course design and development database. The wartime course
            must flow to the student management database no later than (NLT) 30 days
            prior to the initial class start date.
            2.1.4.1.1.1.15. Type M, Basic Military Training. Initial Air Force entry
            training The BMT mission is to transform civilian recruits into disciplined,
            dedicated, physically fit Airmen who have an expeditionary mind-set,
            foundational knowledge and skill in fundamental combat and mission related
            tasks required of all Airmen, and are committed to values required for success
            as Airmen warriors in the United States Air Force.
        2.1.4.1.1.2. The ISD process consists of five phases. The analysis phase defines
        what needs to be trained. Next, an instructional design is crafted to meet this need.
        Only after the design is complete are the instructional materials developed.
        During development, individual and group tryouts of the materials are conducted.
        Results are iteratively fed back into design and development. Evaluation is a
        central feature of ISD and is performed in each phase. The phases are:
            2.1.4.1.1.2.1. Phase 1: Analysis - Determine if training is the appropriate
            solution; if so, define training requirements.
            2.1.4.1.1.2.2. Phase 2: Design - Define objectives, design the training
            program, and select training methods and media.
            2.1.4.1.1.2.3. Phase 3: Development - Develop all training materials in
            accordance with design. Conduct pilot training classes. Refine course, as
            necessary.
            2.1.4.1.1.2.4. Phase 4: Implementation - Implement training, evaluate, and
            refine.
            2.1.4.1.1.2.5. Phase 5: Evaluation - Performed during development, during
            implementation, immediately after training, and six months or more after
            training.
     2.1.4.1.2. Review proposed system acquisition or modification programs to ensure
     subordinate organizations use the ISD process (to include media and cost benefit
     analysis) to decide upon the mix, quantity, sophistication of training equipment, and
     use of technology to deliver efficient and cost effective courseware.
     2.1.4.1.3. Use the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) system
     to ensure subordinate organizations are funded to meet training requirements.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                       11


        2.1.4.1.4. Define the proficiency level (education and training) qualifications for

        the AFCFM.
        4.1.3.4. Waivers will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Submit requests to the
        AFCFM for review and approval/disapproval. Examples of waiver requests may include:
        prerequisite AFSCs, mandatory course attendance (if the individual has equivalent skills
        through civilian experience or education) and skills gained through duty assignments.
        4.1.3.5. No shows will be charged to bases when insufficient time is allowed to obtain a

        Requests to release members from training should only be used for exceptional
        circumstances such as placement on medical profile. AFPC/DPPAOS will backfill the
        training seat. Request for swaps will not be entertained.
     4.1.4. Waiver Requests:
        4.1.4.1. Waiving Specialty Qualification Requirements. Specialty qualification
        requirements are published in the Officer and Enlisted Classification Directories, and the
        CFETP. These requirements may be for entry, award, or retention of the AFS and
        respective skill level. However, special circumstances may warrant waiving these
        requisites. A waiver saves training resources without impacting career field progression
        or mission accomplishment when an individual possesses qualifications equivalent to the
        established requirements.
        4.1.4.2. Evaluating Waiver Requests. Compare each waiver request against
        predetermined standards to maintain AFS integrity. Consider task knowledge and
        performance, ability to learn and transfer knowledge to performance, and future within
        the AFS in equal relation to peers. Requests must consider the following factors:
            4.1.4.2.1. Education. Has the individual completed an equivalent education course or
            certificate program (or equivalency test), or performed duty in an exceptional manner
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          23


        over an extended period of time in the actual or equivalent AFS or civilian
        occupation?
        4.1.4.2.2. Training. Has the individual completed an equivalent technical training
        course or civilian vocational technical training course, certificate program (or
        equivalency test), or performed duty in an exceptional manner over an extended
        period of time in the actual or equivalent AFS or civilian occupation?
        4.1.4.2.3. Knowledge. Does the individual possess the career knowledge equivalent
        to current requirements? Waiver requests must meet the mandatory career knowledge
        topics identified in the specialty description.
        4.1.4.2.4. Experience. Has the individual performed duty over an extended period of
        time in the actual or equivalent AFS or civilian occupation? Supporting
        documentation must include proof of experience, such as performance reports,
        training records, state or federal operating licenses, certificates of affiliation, etc.
        4.1.4.2.5. Other. Does the individual possess the physical ability, aptitude, or
        qualifications that are equivalent to, or commensurate with, the established
        requirement?
        4.1.4.2.6. Individual Involvement. Does the individual acknowledge possessing the
        prescribed training requirements? Trainees must understand what their education and
        training requirements are; accept responsibility for training, and document task
        qualification.
        4.1.4.2.7. Supervisory Involvement. Did the commander and supervisor fulfill their
        obligations to the trainee and the training program? Level of support or involvement
        is not, by itself, justification for approving waivers; it may indicate problems in
        training equity or other areas.
        4.1.4.2.8. Training System Equity. This area relates to circumstances beyond a
        trainee's control such as the following. Were training or testing conditions abnormal?
        Did the training or testing system provide the best opportunity for successful
        completion of training requirements? Was the training or testing system flexible
        enough to allow for unexpected situations or conditions? Did those responsible for the
        training or testing program fulfill their obligations effectively? Depending on the
        facts, this area may warrant options other than approving a waiver.
     4.1.4.3. Processing Waiver Requests. Process waiver requests according to AFI 36-2101,
     Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). Use the following criteria to
     evaluate waiver requests:

 Agency.
4.3. Managing, Administering, and Conducting AETC Type 6 Distance Learning (DL):
   4.3.1. AETC DL is technical training delivered to students at their base of assignment
   without an AETC instructor physically present. AETC DL is also known as Type 6 formal
   technical training, exportable training, and advanced distributed learning (ADL). AETC DL
   extends the training capabilities of AETC Schools to meet specific job and equipment
   training needs in place of resident training. AETC DL media can take the form of interactive
   multimedia instruction (IMI), interactive television (ITV), DVD, CD-ROM, Internet based
   instruction (IBI), paper, or some combination of these. AETC DL does not include CDCs.
       4.3.1.1. HQ AETC instructors are not required at receiving sites (base level), although
       students may interact with instructors by phone, fax, e-mail, etc. Receive sites will have a
       POC available for AETC DL administration and to perform duties described in this
       chapter.
       4.3.1.2. Final approval authority for cancellation and discontinuation of AETC DL
       courses is HQ AETC/A3T.
       4.3.1.3. When ITV is used, follow ATN PMO procedures and guidance for scheduling,
       delivery and administration of ITV programs, satellite distribution of prerecorded video,
       or large-file transfer.

   coordination of AETC DL.
       4.3.2.1. MAJCOM POCs will appoint, by letter, a primary and alternate DL POC for
       each base in the command and provide the name, complete mailing address, DSN and
       commercial phone number, DSN and commercial fax number, and E-mail address for
       both primary and alternate DL POCs to 2 AF. NOTE: Base DL POCs may be the same
       personnel used to support training delivered via the Air Technology Network.) MAJCOM
       DL POCs will notify 2 AF, in writing, of any changes to DL POC appointments using the
       DL POC worksheet accessible on the 2 AF DL site on the AF Portal.
4.3.2. 2. Only MAJCOM appointed DL POCs are authorized to request AETC DL training
products (e.g., course materials, tests, broadcasts). Base DL POC is to inform UTMs of
upcoming AETC DL presentations. 2 AF maintains a current listing of authorized DL POCs on
the 2 AF DL site on the AF Portal.
       4.3.2.3. MAJCOM DL POCs ensure all base DL POCs receive training to perform
       specific duties and responsibilities to administer AETC DL. Provide newly assigned base
       DL POCs training within 90 days of POC assignment to include AETC DL POC training
       conducted by 2 AF.

           5.9.6.5.2. Preparation Time. Plan on a 4-month lead-time to manage the overall
           process of convening a STRT/U&TW and creating or reviewing a CFETP.
           5.9.6.5.3. Conference Site. Conduct STRTs/U&TWs at the technical training
           location. The selection of alternate locations will be coordinated between the Training
           Group Commander, AFCFM, and TPM.
           5.9.6.5.4. Monitoring Activities. Establish a paper or electronic record of actions and
           decisions to support planned activities and expected results.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           45


         5.9.6.5.5. STRT/U&TW Costs. STRTs/U&TWs are costly to prepare and conduct.
         Restrict attendance to essential participants. Essential participants should possess the
         appropriate level of commitment and experience to actively participate.
  5.9.7. Prepare Draft CFETP. The AFCFM will gather CFETP input from MFMs and
  consolidate for review; see Attachment 5. If necessary, convene a working group (consisting
  of AETC TPMs, selected MFMs, AETC TMs and other SMEs) to assist with developing the
  draft CFETP.
     5.9.7.1. Coordinate the draft CFETP with MFMs, TPM and TM.
     5.9.7.2. Edit and prepare final draft CFETP prior to announcing the U&TW.
     5.9.7.3. AETC TM should identify any constraints.
  5.9.8. Prepare for the STRT/U&TW:
     5.9.8.1. Send a message announcing the specifics of the STRT/U&TW to all MFMs and
     affected agencies (see Attachment 6, Figure A6.2). Include the location of the meeting,
     travel days, inclusive dates of the meeting, lodging arrangements and estimated cost,
     transportation requirements, training group and host site POC (if different). Also, provide
     information about the draft CFETP (see Attachment 6, Figure A6.2). Require
     confirmations to include attendee‘s name, grade, duty phone, fax number, e-mail address,
     MAJCOM, and whether attending as a voting member or SME. Specific funding
     arrangements may be required; in such cases, Temporary Duty (TDY) orders and copies
     of final travel voucher may need to be furnished to the funding agency. Request attending
     MFM‘s be given command authority so the CFETP can be finalized at the U&TW.
     5.9.8.2. Draft Agenda. Draft the agenda to ensure all areas have been included in the
     STRT/U&TW.
     5.9.8.3. Establish working groups that encompass a wide range of career field experience
     to address each STRT/U&TW issue. EXAMPLE: STS, 7-skill level training, resident or
     exportable supplemental training, or CDCs. Each group should review appropriate
     portions of the CFETP for continuity.
     5.9.8.4. Prepare handbook and welcome package to provide attendees with a reference to
     smoothly transition from start through conclusion of the meeting.
     5.9.8.5. Reserve Meeting Support Equipment. Develop and finalize materials to support
     the meeting. Acquire the necessary equipment prior to the meeting.
     5.9.8.6. Consider Methods to Establish Rapport. Plan an ―ice breaker‖ the evening before
     or actual start of the STRT/U&TW. Try to alleviate the unexpected.
  5.9.9. Conduct the STRT/U&TW. The STRT is a requirements meeting chaired by the
  AFCFM. Training options and CREs are normally developed as a result of the new
  requirements. If it is obvious the new requirements do not drive additional resources the
  U&TW may be held in conjunction with the STRT. The STRT/U&TW process is divided
  into three segments. Segment one focuses on utilization issues and the specification of
  training task requirements. Segment two concentrates on training proficiency levels and
  training resourcing. Segment two typically follows immediately after segment one with the
46                                               AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     same participants. The third segment is optional and convened if necessary to resolve
     resource or other outstanding issues.
        5.9.9.1. Segment One. The AFCFM will chair this portion of the STRT/U&TW and
        provide identified customer requirements to the training community.
           5.9.9.1.1. Identify training requirements using a logical sequence by first finalizing
           the job description, then 3-skill level technical school requirements, wartime course
           requirements, 5-skill level CDC, core task requirements, 7-skill level CDC, core
           tasks, and formal school requirements.
           5.9.9.1.2. Ensure training references are current and valid. As needed, identify
           training requirements associated with the 9-skill level.
        5.9.9.2. Segment Two. The AETC TPM will chair the training and training-resourcing
        portion of the STRT/U&TW and provide training and training management services.
        AETC will determine the procedures and the TPM is responsible for identifying and
        budgeting for resources needed to support new training programs. Decisions will be made
        (and identified in writing) as to which organizations and agencies will furnish equipment,
        other resources, and required funding for assets required for the first two yearly budget
        cycles following the STRT/U&TW. After which, AETC will provide any and all
        resources required to support the training changes if approved through the POM process.
        (NOTE: Funding can be transferred to the AETC funding baseline via the annual O&M
        Budget. There is no guarantee that changes to training will be funded via the POM
        process). Establish delivery dates for critical resources.
           5.9.9.2.1. Document equipment availability, dates, POCs, transfer dates, and
           transportation costs. Identify training constraints that may result due to equipment
           non-availability.
           5.9.9.2.2. Determine if new or revised courses increase or decrease instructor and
           student man-year requirements. Work with the local manpower office to provide an
           estimate.
           5.9.9.2.3. Classrooms. Determine availability to support training requirements.
           5.9.9.2.4. Document long-range equipment and technology requirements for a
           training program. AETC/A2/3/10 will POM and budget for long-term support of
           training requirements. Include updates, if any, in the STRT/U&TW minutes.
           5.9.9.2.5. Ensure alternate methods and blended ADL/traditional instructional
           approaches are considered for delivery (may include Interactive Television [ITV],
           CD-ROM, Internet, browser-based content, etc) of courses or portions of courses.
        5.9.9.3. AFCFM, AETC TPM and AETC TM joint responsibilities:
           5.9.9.3.1. Establish development schedule and proposed course implementation dates
           for resident and nonresident training courses and determine the resources required.
           Consider the following when establishing the course development schedule and
           implementation dates:
               5.9.9.3.1.1. Consider factors affecting implementation dates for initial skill
               training such as: manpower, facilities, equipment, entry prerequisites,
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           47


            corresponding supplemental (i.e., advanced) courses, and specialty description.
            5.9.9.3.1.2. CDC development schedule (need date) is normally the first class
            graduation date in the new or revised basic course. Other factors are mission
            critical needs identified by the MFMs, Weighted Airman Promotion System
            (WAPS) testing cycle, resource availability, and predicted AU/A4L workload.
            5.9.9.3.1.3. For planning purposes, CDC volume change/supplement change
            (minor revision) is 30 days; simple revision is 45 days; major revision (typical) is
            60 days; and complicated revision is 75 days. NOTE: AU/A4L development time
            is 120 days. The AETC Form 469, Course Chart, is submitted a minimum of 30
            days prior to the submission of either type revision.
            5.9.9.3.1.4. Establish a customer delivery date, which is normally the date of the
            first class graduation date of the new or revised course. The AETC TM in
            consultation with HQ AU/A4L calculates projected delivery capability with the
            agreed upon date annotated in the STRT/U&TW meeting minutes.
        5.9.9.3.2. Document this information in the CFETP and STRT/U&TW minutes.
     5.9.9.4. Segment Three. Issue Resolution, is required only when unresolved issues
     remain. When required, a senior AETC official (normally AETC/A3T) chairs an issue
     resolution meeting. Participants, along with the AETC chair, are usually Air Staff and
     MAJCOM functional representatives with authority to transfer resources to the training
     community or accept a reduced level of training, i.e. AFCFMs, TPMs and TMs. Potential
     outcomes are reallocation of resources, reduction in training demands, or deferment of
     training changes until required resources can be provided through the corporate
     budgeting process. Defer areas needing additional research or coordination before a final
     decision can be made after the U&TW is completed. Incorporate these taskings and
     associated suspense dates within meeting minutes.
  5.9.10. Workshop Follow-up Requirements:
     5.9.10.1. The AFCFM and AETC TPM will prepare comprehensive minutes of the
     STRT/U&TW activities and decisions. The minutes will include attachments to
     validate/update customer requirements identified at the STRT/U&TW and provide
     greater detail including suspense dates for deferred action items. NOTE: Only the CFM
     is required to sign the meeting minutes if the STRT was held without a U&TW.
     5.9.10.2. The AFCFM consolidates and publishes final CFETP (see Attachment 2,
     Table A2.1 and Table A2.2). At the conclusion of the STRT/U&TW, participants may
     be tasked to coordinate the CFETP, conduct additional research, verify information, or
     validate training requirements within a specified period. All training requirements and
     resources should be included in the CFETP to support specialty training.

                                              Chapter 6

                 AIR FORCE ON-THE-JOB TRAINING ADMINISTRATION

6.1. Structure of the Air Force On-The-Job Training Program:
      6.1.1. Overview. Skilled and trained personnel are critical to the AF in providing a strong
      national defense capability. The AF On-the-Job Training (OJT) Program provides training
      for personnel to attain knowledge and skill qualifications required to perform duty in their
      specialty.
      6.1.2. Strategy. Develop, manage, and execute training programs providing realistic and
      flexible training producing a highly skilled, motivated force capable of carrying out all tasks
      and functions in support of the AF mission. These programs should provide the foundation
      for AF readiness.
      6.1.3. Training and Mission Accomplishment. Training is an integral part of the unit‘s
      mission. An effective training program requires commander and supervisory involvement at
      all levels.
      6.1.4. Training and Airman Career Program. Supervisors must explain to trainees the
      relationship of training to career progression. While the supervisor‘s primary responsibility is
      to plan a program outlining specific short term mission related goals for the trainee, overall
      success depends on the supervisor‘s ability to advise and assist airmen to reach long range
      career objectives. Supervisors must take an active role in the trainee‘s career progression.
      6.1.5. Training Components. The AF OJT program consists of three components. The first
      component, job knowledge, is satisfied through CDCs designed to provide basic knowledge
      across a wide spectrum of subjects pertaining to a career field. When CDCs are not available
      trainees study the applicable technical references identified by the supervisor and/or CFETP.
      The second component is job proficiency. This is the hands-on training provided on the job,
      allowing the trainee to gain proficiency in tasks performed in the work center. The third
      component is job experience, gained during and after upgrade training, to build confidence
      and competence. Career knowledge, general task, and deployment/unit type code (UTC) task
      knowledge, applicable to the AFSC, is gained through a planned program of study involving
      CDCs or TRs listed in the applicable CFETP.
      6.1.6. Total Force Training. Upgrade, Job Proficiency, and Retraining:
         6.1.6.1. Upgrade Training (UGT) is the key to the total training program. It leads to
         award of the higher skill level and is designed to increase skills and abilities.
         6.1.6.2. As stated in paragraph 6.1.5, hands-on training provides job proficiency while
         experience increases skills and builds confidence in the trainees. AFSC UGT
         requirements for award of the 3/5/7 and 9-skill levels are outlined in Chapter 4 of this
         instruction, AFI 36-2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), the
         AFECD, and the applicable CFETP.
         6.1.6.3. Retraining Program. The retraining program is designed to balance the numbers
         of personnel in specific grades and year groups of the Air Force Specialties (AFS). Once
         retraining is approved and the Airman has been assigned duty in the new specialty, UGT
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          49


      begins. With minor exceptions, training requirements for retrainees and standard upgrade
      trainees are identical. The Chief‘s Group (HQ USAF/DPE) must coordinate and approve
      chief master sergeants (CMSgt) who cross flow, including those returning to active duty
      from ANG and AFRC assets.

       trainee.
       6.6.25.16. Record and file the progress review in the AF Form 623 (or automated
       training records) until the member is upgraded. Commander will review documentation.
6.7. Supervisor, Trainer, Task Certifier, and Trainee Responsibilities.
   6.7.1. Supervisor Responsibilities. Supervisors have the single greatest impact on mission
   accomplishment. They must share their experiences and expertise to meet mission
   requirements and provide a quality training program to the trainee. Supervisors must plan,
   conduct, and evaluate training.
       6.7.1.1. Use CFETPs to manage work center and individual training.
       6.7.1.2. Develop Master Training Plan (MTP). Develop Master Training Plan (MTP) or
       electronic equivalent to ensure completion of all work center duty position requirements
       (e.g. 100 percent task coverage). For guidance on developing a MTP, refer to
       Attachment 13. As a minimum the training plan must include:
          6.7.1.2.1. Master Task List (MTL). The MTL identifies all day-to-day mission (duty
          position) requirements, core tasks, in-garrison and contingency tasks, and additional
          duties performed by work center personnel.
          6.7.1.2.2. Current CFETP or AFJQS.
          6.7.1.2.3. Locally developed or electronic equivalent AF Form 797, Job Qualification
          Standard (JQS) Continuation Sheet (if applicable).
          6.7.1.2.4. Milestones for tasks and CDC completion (identify the projected
          timeframe the trainee will complete all required tasks, HST, deployment/UTC tasks,
          and each set of CDCs as required).
       6.7.1.3. Work centers with one person assigned only require a master task list, unless
       otherwise directed by the AFCFM. Positions such as First Sergeant and Group/Unit
       Superintendents, Career Assistance Advisors, etc. do not require a MTL and are exempt
       from this requirement. Additionally, MTLs are not required for SNCOs working in staff
       functions above wing level i.e. NAF, MAJCOM, and HAF. This does not apply to
       SNCOs in retraining status.

     when the AFJQS reflects all mandatory core tasks as identified in the current CFETP,
     Part II.
     NOTE: If using an AFJQS, maintain current (printed or electronic) copy of CFETP in a
     central location within the work center for reference.
     6.7.1.6. Integrate training with day-to-day work center operations and consider trainer
     and equipment availability, training opportunities, schedules, etc.
     6.7.1.7. Maintain AF Form 623, six-part folder, or other approved training record for:
     Airmen in the grades of Airman Basic through Technical Sergeant (or personnel in
     combat ready duty positions, if required by the AFCFM) and SNCOs in retraining status,
     or as directed by the AFCFM. SNCOs who hold a skill level commensurate with their
     grade and Duty Air Force Specialty Code are considered qualified and do not require
     training records unless directed by the AFCFM.
     6.7.1.8. Prior to submission for upgrade, ensure the trainee, as a minimum, meets all
     mandatory requirements as defined in the AFECD, applicable CFETP, and AFJQS.
     6.7.1.9. Recommend the UTM initiate personnel action on trainees entering, completing,
     or withdrawn from training.

      exceptions:
          6.7.3.9.1. For AFSCs, duty positions, units, and/or work centers with specialized
          training standardization and certification requirements (e.g., space ops/missile
          maintenance shops, Maintenance Training Flight and/or HQ AETC instructors, air
          traffic controllers, aircrew standardization flight examiners, load masters, fire
          fighters, radiology, etc) the trainer/instructor is authorized to train and certify task
          qualification. Third-party certification is not required unless otherwise directed.
          6.7.3.9.2. If trainee task qualification occurs through Type-1, contractor-provided
          training without supporting documentation, supervisors/trainers who have attended
          the AFTC may document task qualifications as applicable. MAJCOM FMs in
          coordination with MAJCOM Training Managers may authorize exceptions when no
          one assigned locally meets the requirements.
          6.7.3.9.3. For those AFSCs with special requirements or needs, such as 3P0XX,
          1C1X1, senior airmen may perform this function, with approval from AFCFM.
   6.7.4. Trainee Responsibilities. The trainee is the focal point of the AF training program.
   Trainees must make every effort to become qualified to perform in their AFS. The success
   and quality of trainee training greatly depends on the relationship between the supervisor,
   trainer, and trainee. Trainees must:
      6.7.4.1. Actively participate in all opportunities for upgrade and qualification training.
      6.7.4.2. Comprehend the applicable CFETP requirements and career path.
      6.7.4.3. Obtain and maintain knowledge, qualifications, certifications, and appropriate
      skill level within the assigned specialty.
      6.7.4.4. Budget on- and off-duty time to complete assigned training tasks, particularly
      CDC and self-study training requirements, within established time limits.

      with any part of training.
      6.7.4.6. Acknowledge and document task qualification upon completion of training.
      Documenting task qualification serves as an official certification of proficiency,
      certifying the individual is accountable for task performance IAW the governing
      instructions.
      6.7.4.7. Understand their deployment/UTC, and home station requirements.
6.8. Training Forms and Documentation.
   6.8.1. Introduction. The purpose of this section is to provide guidance and examples for
   proper training documentation. Training documentation is important to personnel at all levels
   because it validates the status of training and task qualification. Documentation also helps
   management assess mission capability and readiness, and it defines requirements for
 66                                               AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


      individual career progression. The AF Form 623 (or electronic equivalent) is the standard
      folder used as a training record. The AFCFM, with AFPC/DPSIT coordination, may approve
      the use of AF Form 623b, Individual Training Record, throughout the career field. AFCFMs
      in conjunction with AFPC/DPSIT will provide specific implementation guidance for the AF
      Form 623b.
         6.8.1.1. Using AF Form 623, AF Form 623b, or other approved records. The AF Form
         623 reflects past and current qualifications, and is used to determine training
         requirements. Supervisors will ensure all documentation is accurate and comprehensive.
         All forms contained in the AF Form 623 may be automated using AF approved systems.
         However, if forms and the CFETP are automated they must meet the same documentation
         requirements (dates and initials of trainee, trainer, and/or task certifier) as hard copy
         forms. Automated training records may be placed on a disk for mobility purposes.
         6.8.1.2. CFMs are encouraged to use automated CFETPs. Minimize the use of the paper-
         based record if training records and CFETP are automated. Advise A1DLT as records are
         automated.
         6.8.1.3. The AF Form 623 must contain the following documents, in addition to any
         locally determined requirements. All other forms contained in the AF Form 623 may also
         be automated with the approval of the AFCFM.
             6.8.1.3.1. CFETP.
             6.8.1.3.2. AFJQS (if applicable).
             6.8.1.3.3. AF Form 797 (if applicable).
             6.8.1.3.4. AF Form 623a or automated version.
             6.8.1.3.5. CDC enrollment card, answer score sheets and scorecards (if enrolled in
             CDCs). (Maintain until completion of UGT or qualification training).
             6.8.1.3.6. AETC Form 156 or electronic equivalent (maintain until completion of 5
             skill level UGT).
             6.8.1.3.7. AF Form 2096.
      6.8.2. Maintaining AF Form 623. Supervisors maintain the AF Form 623 for all assigned
      personnel IAW paragraph 6.7.1 of this instruction, when required. AF Form 623 will be
      available to all personnel in the chain of command to include the UTM upon request. Replace
      unusable AF Forms 623, as required; ensuring all pertinent information is transferred to the
      new record.
      6.8.3. Disposition of AF Form 623. Upon separation, retirement, commissioning, or
      promotion to master sergeant, unless otherwise directed by the AFCFM, returns to the
      individual. Do not give AF Forms 623 containing classified information to the individual.
      NOTE: AFCFMs may request exception to policy of documentation rules from AF/A1DLT.
      An example of this would be the use of six-part folders or electronic records by some
      AFCFMs.
6.9. CFETP (or Electronic Equivalent). A comprehensive core training document identifying
life cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, core and HST, and
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           67


deployment/UTC task requirements for a specialty. Supervisors use the CFETP to plan,
prioritize, manage, and execute training within the career field. CFETPs are used to identify and
certify all past and current qualifications.
   6.9.1. In an effort to reduce local CFETP printing costs, the following options are
   authorized:
       6.9.1.1. Keep at least one copy of the entire CFETP (part 1 and 2) in the work center for
       general access and master training plan development.
       6.9.1.2. Unless otherwise directed by the AFCFM, work center supervisors may file only
       part 2 of the CFETP, with the cover page and ID page, in the AF Form 623, or equivalent
       form.
       6.9.1.3. Additionally, if the CFETP is divided into distinct sections (by aircraft, duty
       position, mission, etc) then file only the sections applicable to the individual, such as
       current/past qualifications, and current upgrade/ duty position training requirements.
       6.9.1.4. Keep used sections intact, regardless of the degree of use.
       6.9.1.5. As duty/training requirements change, insert applicable CFETP sections in the
       prescribed numerical order.
   6.9.2. Part I. Provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty and
   will be maintained as part of the work center MTP.
       6.9.2.1. Section A—explains how everyone will use the plan.
       6.9.2.2. Section B—identifies career field progression information, duties and
       responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.
       6.9.2.3. Section C—associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge,
       education, training, and other).
       6.9.2.4. Section D—indicates resource constraints (some examples are funds, manpower,
       equipment, facilities).
       6.9.2.5. Section E—identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through
       MSgt and other SNCOs as required by the AFCFM.
   6.9.3. Part II. Includes the following:
       6.9.3.1. Section A—contains the STS identifying the duties, tasks, and TRs to support
       training, AETC conducted training, core and HST tasks, deployment/UTC tasks, and
       correspondence course requirements.
       6.9.3.2. Section B—contains the COL and training standards to determine airmen
       training requirements.
       6.9.3.3. Section C—identifies available support materials. When developed, use a
       Qualification Training Plan to support proficiency training.
       6.9.3.4. Section D—identifies a training course index.
       6.9.3.5. Section E—identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements.

     6.9.4. AFJQS. Training documents approved by the AFCFM for a particular job type or duty
     position within an AFS
     6.9.5. Performance Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the ―Go‖ level. ―Go‖ means
     the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy,
     timeliness, and correct use of procedures (―Go‖ level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency
     code key).
     6.9.6. CFETP/AFJQS Documentation. All personnel authorized to sign off tasks in Part II of
     the CFETP must be listed on the Identification Block of the CFETP, Part II, including
     automated CFETPs. Supervisors must not change or re-accomplish any documentation
     completed before the release of the current AFI. The AF training record documentation is
     intended to be a complete history of qualifications and training completed. The AFCFM must
     follow current guidance in Chapter 5 of this instruction when developing new CFETPs.
        6.9.6.1. Documentation. Using the MTL, identify all duty position requirements,
        including those core tasks associated with the current duty position as directed by the
        AFCFM or MFM, by circling the sub-paragraph number next to the task statement.
        NOTE: Training on all applicable core tasks is still required for upgrade unless otherwise
        stated by the AFCFM (see paragraphs 4.1.2.2 and 6.9.6.1.2). Deviations in
        documentation of the MTL may be necessary when using electronic records as long as all
        required tasked are recorded on the document.
            6.9.6.1.1. When completing the identification page, enter only the last 4 digits of the
            SSN.
            6.9.6.1.2. Once initially certified, individuals are not required to maintain core task
            qualifications unless the task is part of the current duty position. (If task is part of the
            current duty position, it will remain circled. If not part of the current duty position,
            the circle may be removed). Core task training is not required if the training
            capability does not exist at the assigned base, or another base within the local area.
            Conversely, core task training is required if the training capability resides in another
            unit at the same base (unless otherwise directed by the AFCFM). Annotate on the AF
            Form 623a or automated version the reason core task training was not conducted.
            There is no requirement to send personnel TDY for core task training.
            6.9.6.1.3. As a minimum for initial certification complete the following columns in
            Part II of the CFETP:
                6.9.6.1.3.1. Training start date (day, month, year).
                6.9.6.1.3.2. Training complete date (day, month, year).
                6.9.6.1.3.3. Trainee Initials (upon completion of training).
                6.9.6.1.3.4. Trainer Initials (upon completion of training).
                6.9.6.1.3.5. Certifier initials when required by AFCFM (for tasks requiring third-
                party certification).
                NOTE: All entries on documents contained in or on the AF Form 623, to include
                the CFETP, AFJQS, AF Form 797, AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and
                Recurring Training, AF Form 803, and any additional training documents as
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              69


            determined by local requirements, will be documented in pencil, unless forms are
            automated and tracked in an approved electronic system. Entries on forms that are
            not subject to change, such as the front cover of the AF Form 623, signatures and
            AF Form 623a entries will be made in black or blue ink. However, if these
            publications/forms make up an automated training documentation package, pencil
            entries are not required.
        6.9.6.1.4. Knowledge training. Knowledge training is required if no CDC is available
        for the AFS or training must be documented for a CDC waiver. Define and develop,
        if necessary, evaluation criteria for career knowledge items to ensure comprehension.
        Document knowledge training IAW paragraph 6.9.6.1.
        6.9.6.1.5. Each time an Airman changes duty positions (transfers from another base
        or work center), the supervisor must perform an initial evaluation that includes a
        review of all previously certified tasks. These tasks are compared against the master
        task list and will determine the extent of training required for the new duty position.
        The supervisor will identify all new tasks applicable to the new duty position and
        erase all circles that do not apply to the current duty position. Do not erase the initials
        and certification dates of previously certified tasks. If the Airman was previously
        qualified on the task, the supervisor determines if he/she is still qualified. If the
        Airman is found to be qualified, no further action is required. If the Airman is found
        to be unqualified on a previously certified task, the supervisor must ensure the task is
        trained on and recertified. Record the initial evaluation on AF Form 623a or
        automated version and retain in the training record until PCS/PCA.
        NOTE: Supervisors in units using approved automated systems must remember to
        code and/or transcribe all tasks previously certified but not required in the current
        duty section.
     6.9.6.2. Transcribing. Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative
     function, not a re-evaluation of training. Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered
     synonymous for the purpose of documentation. Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for
     ARC) of CFETP revision date or from date revision is posted to automated training
     records system. Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to
     transcribe:
        6.9.6.2.1. Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and
        to transcribe qualifications from the previous CFETP.
        6.9.6.2.2. For tasks previously qualified/certified and required in the current duty
        position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the
        current date in the completion column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the
        current task certifier or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column.
        6.9.6.2.3. For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position
        (do not circle), transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials). If the ta sk
        later becomes required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.
        6.9.6.2.4. Annotate the AF Form 623a or automated version, (for example, ―I certify
        the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP
70                                                AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


            dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.‖ Signed and dated by
            supervisor and trainee).
        6.9.6.3. Maintenance of CFETPs for personnel in retraining status. Maintain CFETP
        from previous AFSC until commensurate skill level is achieved, then give the obsolete
        field CFETP to the individual.
        6.9.6.4. Decertification and Recertification. When a supervisor determines an Airman is
        unqualified on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor erases the
        previous certification, or deletes certification when using automated system. Appropriate
        remarks pertaining to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623a or
        automated version. Begin recertification (if required) following procedures in paragraph
        6.9.6.1.3.
     6.9.7. AF Form 623a or automated version. The AF Form 623a or automated version will be
     used to document an individual‘s training progression. This form will be used to reflect
     training status, counseling, and breaks in training. The supervisor and/or trainer and the
     trainee must sign and date all entries. All entries should be made in black or blue ink and
     include the date the counseling/entry is made, the statement or entry, and the trainee and
     supervisor signature. These requirements apply to all AFCFM approved training forms,
     regardless of format.
        6.9.7.1. Examples of AF Form 623a or automated version entries include initial CDC
        issue, CDC completion schedule, explanation of delays in CDC completion and/or
        training requirements, problems encountered with task certification (if any), and any
        training related counseling statements.
        6.9.7.2. When used for training-related counseling, include strengths, weaknesses, areas
        to improve, and means to improve.
        6.9.7.3. Maintain the AF Form 623a or automated version as long as it pertains to the
        current training objective (i.e., award of the skill level or completion of qualification
        training). The supervisor will determine if any additional AF Forms 623a or automated
        version will remain in the training record.
     6.9.8. AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard (JQS) Continuation Sheet. The AF Form
     797 is a continuation of the CFETP, Part II, or AFJQS. It defines locally assigned duty
     position, HST, and deployment/UTC requirements not included in the CFETP, Part II. It is
     also used to develop the AFJQS and the command job qualification standard if deemed
     necessary by the AFCFM. The AF Form 797 disposition is the same as the CFETP and
     AFJQS. When used to expand a section of the CFETP or to add duties not listed in other
     documents, a master copy should be placed in the section master training plan. The AF
     Form(s) 797 would then be placed in the training records of the person(s) performing that
     duty. If the work center supervisor develops an all-inclusive AF Form 797 for the work
     center, circle only those tasks that pertain to the individual performing the task or duty.
     Documentation of the electronic form is as follows:
        6.9.8.1. Column a, Critical Tasks, will place a symbol in the square automatically when
        you click on the box next to the task statement. This will identify tasks you have
        determined to be a critical or AFJQS core task, or a task requiring third party
        certification.

     manner as on the CFETP.
     6.9.8.7. Enter trainee name and page number on the bottom of the form.
  6.9.9. AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluation. Evaluators use the AF Form 803 to conduct
  and document completion of task evaluations during training SAVs, when directed by the
  commander, or when a task certification requires validation. Supervisors, trainers, task
  certifiers, and training managers can use this form to record up to 6 task evaluations per
  form. If evaluations are conducted on a single trainee by the supervisor/trainer, or task
  certifier, file completed evaluations in the AF Form 623 until upgraded or no longer
  applicable to current duty position. Training managers maintain task evaluations performed
  during SAVs with the completed report.
     6.9.9.1. Enter trainee‘s name, grade, and AFSC in the applicable blocks. In the UGT
     block check either yes or no to indicate UGT status.

     evaluator, and signature of evaluator.
  6.9.10. AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training. Supervisors use
  the AF Form 1098 to document selected tasks requiring recurring training or evaluation. AF
  and MAJCOM directives may identify tasks contained in the CFETP requiring special
  certification, recurring training, or evaluation. This form may be overprinted and filed in the
  AF Form 623. For tasks requiring certification this form should remain in the training record
  until superseded or no longer required.
     6.9.10.1. Column A: Enter the task title and training references.

        exceed the date completed. For example if the date completed was 15 Jan 03 the due date
        must be prior to 15 Jan 04 for training that is conducted annually.
     6.9.11. AF Form 1320a, Training Chart. The chart provides a method for organizing,
     scheduling, and recording training goals and qualifications. The instructions for using this
     form are located on the back of the form.
     6.9.12. Qualification Training Packages (QTP). AFCFMs develop, manage, and implement
     QTPs. They are used to assist task certification.
6.10. CDC Program Management.
     6.10.1. Purpose and Scope. CDCs are published to provide the information necessary to
     satisfy the career knowledge component of OJT. These courses are developed from
     references identified in the CFETP correlating with mandatory knowledge items listed in
     Enlisted/Officer Classification Directory. CDCs must contain information on basic
     principles, techniques, and procedures common to an AFSC. They do not contain
     information on specific equipment or tasks unless best illustrating a procedure or technique
     having utility to the entire AFSC.
     6.10.2. CDCs for UGT. HQ AU/A4L electronically publishes an AFSC listing of CDC
     Requirements, identifying all mandatory CDCs for skill level upgrade. The list is available
     on the HQ AU/A4L web site at http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/.
        6.10.2.1. If available, supervisors will use CDCs to satisfy career knowledge
        requirements for UGT.
        6.10.2.2. If a CDC becomes available after entering UGT, the individual does not have to
        take the CDC, unless specified by the AFCFM.
        6.10.2.3. An individual cannot be disenrolled from a current CDC enrollment unless
        specified by the AFCFM or member is being discharged. Airmen enrolled in 7 -level
        courses upon receipt of a line number who subsequently lose their line number are
        reverted back to TSC R as a 5-level and must be disenrolled from the 7-level CDC.
        6.10.2.4. Supervisors will conduct training to support specific required task knowledge
        using CFETP references.
        6.10.2.5. If a trainee is at the 8th month of CDC enrollment and is within 60 days of
        PCS, the losing UTM will request an extension of the enrollment.
        6.10.2.6. Upon a trainee‘s arrival at a new organization, the gaining UTM will process a
        change of address within 30 days of trainee‘s assignment.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                         73


      6.10.2.7. The UTM will use the OJT roster to monitor the CDC program. The CDC
      program is managed to effectively minimize failures, extensions, non-completions, and
      reactivations.
      6.10.2.8. The UTM will ensure trainees are enrolled in required CDCs within 45 days of
      in processing (within 60 days for overseas units). CDCs will not be ordered until the
      trainee has completed technical training and arrives at the first duty station. CDCs must
      be issued within 10 duty days of receipt.
      6.10.2.9. For AFSCs that require additional training prior to entry into 5-level UGT
      CDCs will be ordered after completion of the required training and must be issued within
      14 days of receipt (60 for ARC) IAW AFCFM directives. NOTE: Some AFSCs may
      require completion of Distance Learning Course prior to entering TSC B.
      6.10.2.10. Commercially purchased/produced software and locally developed test-
      question generating software by using testable material for test preparation is not
      authorized for use on government computers. Refer to AFI 36-2605 for further guidance.
      6.10.2.11. If the trainee has reached the 10th month of enrollment and has not taken the
      CE, the UTM will process a request for an extension.
      6.10.2.12. If recommending an exemption/exception to policy for trainees to complete
      mandatory CDCs for upgrade or qualification training, the UTM will process the request
      IAW paragraph 4.1.4.7. AFCFM is the final authority for this request.

                            CDC. The training manager will check the transaction register
                            or the HQ AU/A4L CDSAR system within 5 days to verify
                            enrollment request. ARC will check the system during the
                            following Unit Training Assembly (UTA). Do not enroll
                            trainees in more than one CDC at a time unless specified by the
                            AFCFM. For IMAs, contact HQ ARPC Education and Training
                            Office. The supervisor notifies the IMA of the CDC enrollment
                            and arranges for issue of CDC materials.
4    A CDC is received      Within 10 duty days of receipt the UTM issues CDC materials
                            to the supervisor and trainee and briefs them on the proper use
                            of the CDC and makes entry into the trainee‘s AF FM 623a or
                            equivalent automated training record. The supervisor and
                            trainee conduct an inventory of course material. Trainee will
                            make pen and ink changes and post, if necessary.

                                    ANCILLARY TRAINING

7.1. Program Description. Ancillary Training is universal training, guidance or instruction,
regardless of AFSC, that contributes to mission accomplishment. It does not include functional,
occupational or additional duty training.
7.2. Requirements. Ancillary training courses are established IAW international treaties, law,
DoD directives, and AFIs. The approved list of ancillary training is posted on the ETCA website
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
      7.2.1. Every effort must be made to ensure ancillary training is targeted carefully to the
      audience who needs the training, at the minimum frequency required to ensure retention, and
      that course lengths are no longer than necessary to adequately convey the information.
      7.2.2. While the effort to reduce requirements is intended to maximize unit effectiveness,
      commanders are reminded intelligent, sensible training remains an indispensable
      responsibility of the USAF. When local conditions or mission requirements demand
      additional or enhanced training, commanders have the discretion to train their Airmen as they
      deem necessary.
7.3. Ancillary Training Categories. Ancillary training may be accomplished through a variety
of methods including formal courses, mass briefings, advanced distributed learning, credit for
civilian equivalent experience, and one-on-one instruction. Ancillary training can be a one-time
event or recurring requirement and is divided into the following four categories:
      7.3.1. Annual Total Force Awareness Training (TFAT). General awareness-level training for
      the ―Total Force‖ mandated by Congress, DoD or USAF combined into concise, Computer
      Based Training (CBT). Training in these courses is required annually for all Airmen (Regular
      AF, Civilian, Guard and Reserve).
         7.3.1.1. In some cases, contracted employees and foreign national employees are not
         required to accomplish certain TFAT courses. Exceptions are listed in the ETCA
         descriptions for each TFAT course.
         7.3.1.2. Except where noted, TFAT training is accessed through the Advanced
         Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil. AF members who
         do not have an ADLS account can establish one by visiting the web site. ADLS can also
         be accessed from the Air Force Portal home page under ―Top Links and Applications:
         Training Links.‖
         7.3.1.3. Whenever possible, ADLS is the preferred method for completing TFAT.
         Airmen who complete their training on ADLS will have their records updated
         automatically. However, units have the option to download TFAT computer-based
         training to a local server and deliver the courses ―off-line‖ to individuals as needed.
             7.3.1.3.1. TFAT can also be accomplished in a mass briefing format by using the
             ADLS presentation. Mass training must be led by a unit ―functional expert‖ or
             commander (to include civilian equivalent) approved instructor.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          83


          7.3.1.3.2. Downloaded training or mass briefing options should only be used by units
          with limited computer access or availability.
          7.3.1.3.3. For either downloaded CBTs or instructor-led briefings, ancillary training
          monitors or unit training managers must certify completion and update ADLS for
          members to ensure full credit. Instructions for downloading and tracking ―off-line‖
          accomplishment of TFAT courses are provided in the ―UTM/UDM portal‖ from the
          Administration link on ADLS. NOTE: AF Reserve units are authorized to report
          member completion through ARCNet.
          7.3.1.3.4. Commanders should use care in determining whether to use any ―off-line‖
          training options giving full consideration to the resulting increased workload.
   7.3.2. Selected Force Training. Ancillary training targeted to specific groups or populations
   (e.g. Commanders, Supervisors, Civilians) versus the Total Force. For example, commanders
   and other select Air Force members are required to accomplish Survivor Assistance
   Awareness Training annually.
      7.3.2.1. This training is usually accomplished locally, and taught by unit experts who
      receive curriculum and other training related guidance from AF-level Course
      Owner/Sponsors (see paragraph 7.2.2).
      7.3.2.2. In most cases, this is recurring training, but some courses are one-time only
      events.
      7.3.2.3. Designated unit training personnel and Wing/Unit Level Training Agencies
      share responsibility for tracking accomplishment of this training and will ensure
      established measures are used for managing accountability.
   7.3.3. Event Driven Training. Ancillary training triggered by an event (e.g. inprocessing)
   and can be a one-time occurrence (e.g. Motorcycle Operator Training) or recurring (e.g.
   Equal Opportunity Human Relations Orientation).
      7.3.3.1. These courses are accomplished at the local level either by unit or base level
      training agencies.
      7.3.3.2. As with Selected Force Training, designated unit training personnel and the
      unit/base training agencies share responsibility for tracking this training.
   7.3.4. Expeditionary Skills Training (EST). Training directly related to an Airman‘s ability
   to survive and operate in a contingency environment.
      7.3.4.1. Due to the critical nature of EST, this category is managed separately from other
      ancillary training categories, and should be perceived at all levels as the most important
      training priority. See Chapter 8 of this instruction for specific guidance on EST.
      7.3.4.2. EST has also been referred to as Expeditionary Airmen Training, Deployment
      Training, and Readiness Training. Courses referred to by these terms are included in this
      training category.
      7.3.4.3. Provisions in paragraph 7.3.1.3 also apply to EST accomplished by CBT (as
      designated in Tier 2 course lists available at AEF Online paragraph 8.4.2).
7.4. Program Responsibilities:

         are responsible for completing any training required by their specific service contract.
7.5. Air Force Learning Committee (AFLC). The Air Force Learning Committee (AFLC)
provides senior leader guidance regarding the focus and subject matter of Air Force programs
designed to develop institutional competencies through AF education and ancillary training. The
AFLC is the ―gatekeeper‖ process to vet new ancillary training requirements, establish priorities,
and determine efficient delivery options for the Total Force. The strategic goal of the AFLC is to
provide broad guidance for institutional competency development to improve the focus, currency
and relevancy of Air Force curricula and training through a corporate view of AF priorities.
      7.5.1. The AFLC is a general officer level body chaired by the Air Force Director for Force
      Development (AF/A1D) and supported by a Working Group. The Working Group will
      thoroughly study inputs and provide their recommendations to the Committee. The AFLC
      will forward recommendations to the Force Management and Development Council (FMDC)
      for final disposition. These successive levels of review provide a ―holistic‖ approach to
      managing ancillary training requirements for the Total Force.
      7.5.2. The AFLC will be the AF governing body for adding, deleting or modifying existing
      ancillary training requirements to include ―Total Force Awareness,‖ ―Selected Force,‖ and
      ―Event Driven‖ categories and establishes the process to:
         7.5.2.1. Review and validate new ancillary training requirements.
         7.5.2.2. Modify or increase existing ancillary training requirements.
      7.5.3. New requirements or changes to frequency, duration, or target groups for AF-level
      ancillary training may come from Air Staff functional 2-digits, MAJCOM/A1s, or Reserve
      Components (‗upward suggestive‘) and must flow through AF/A1DL to initiate review and
      action by the AFLC. External agencies or sources such as Congress, the Office of Personnel
      Management, or the Office of the Secretary of Defense can also direct the AF to provide
      ancillary training (‗downward directive‘).
         7.5.3.1. Designated AF Course Owner/Sponsors for upward-suggestive or downward-
         directed ancillary training requirements must flow proposals through AF/A1DL for
         review by the AFLC to minimize impact on the Total Force and ensure efficient delivery
         methods are considered in complying with the mandate.
         7.5.3.2. No ancillary training requirement will be funded, developed or fielded without
         approval from the AFLC. NOTE: Functional, additional duty and expeditionary skills
         training requirements are managed by other processes.
      7.5.4. Air Force Learning Committee Operational Process:
         7.5.4.1. Changes to baseline requirements shall flow through the Air Force Directorate
         for Force Development‘s Learning Division (AF/A1DL). AF/A1DL shall forward all
         ancillary training proposals to appropriate Working Group members as soon as possible
         for an initial review and collaboration with the requestor prior to engaging the AFLC.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              87


     The Working Group will then convene to review requesting Course Owner/Sponsor
     proposals, make recommendations and forward to the AFLC for action.
     7.5.4.2. In the case of a proposal to add new ancillary training requirement affecting the
     Total Force, the requesting Course Owner/Sponsor will submit a proposal (see
     Attachment 14) to A1DL for initial review. The proposal provides standardized, detailed
     information on objectives, targeted audience, frequency and proposed delivery methods
     allowing AFLC WG members to evaluate essential elements of each proposal. As part of
     the initial review, A1DL will ensure these essential questions are addressed:
         7.5.4.2.1. What is driving the requirement?
         7.5.4.2.2. Is requested training already available?
         7.5.4.2.3. Is the content/duration/audience/frequency/requested media proposed by
         the requesting Course Owner/Sponsor appropriate for the requirement?
     7.5.4.3. A1DL will serve as the liaison between Working Group members and requesting
     Course Owner/Sponsors to consolidate questions, resolve open issues, and prepare final
     proposals with recommendations for AFLC action.
  7.5.5. The AFLC will vet ancillary training proposals to ensure:
     7.5.5.1. The proposals are targeted to the correct audience via the appropriate delivery
     method.
     7.5.5.2. The proposals are properly defined and clearly identify the training objectives.
     7.5.5.3. There is an implementation/replacement strategy for existing requirements.
     7.5.5.4. There is an understanding of the ―cost‖ to accommodate the new requirement.
     7.5.5.5. The AFLC also recommends the length of time each adjustment will last. Based
     on the cases laid out and the views of AFLC Working Group members, the AFLC will
     vote on which proposals to recommend for approval, modification or disapproval. AFLC
     recommendations are then forwarded to the FMDC for final disposition.
     7.5.5.6. If approved by the FMDC, the requesting Course Owner/Sponsor will develop
     the initiative, in accordance with applicable directives and the FMDC‘s recommendation.
     7.5.5.7. If the course is to be hosted on ADLS, the Requestor/Course Owner will
     coordinate with AETC/A3IA on technical aspects of developing the on-line module.
     7.5.5.8. A1DL will coordinate with Course Owner/Sponsors and AFPC/DPSIT to ensure
     ETCA is updated to reflect the new course and that an announcement is released to the
     field.
  7.5.6. AFLC Roles and Responsibilities:
     7.5.6.1. AF Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel, and Services (AF/A1). The
     SECAF-designated "Gatekeeper" for all ancillary training. The AF/A1 owns the AFLC
     process.

        on the type and level of ancillary training proposals submitted, will identify and invite
        representatives to participate in Working Group meetings.
     7.5.6.4. MAJCOM/A1s. As the focal point for Airmen development in the field,
     MAJCOM/A1s submit requests to change ancillary training, the institutional competency
     development program baseline/ or AF Special Areas of Emphasis (SAEs). They serve as
     the OPR for identifying requirements in their respective areas. MAJCOM/A1s forward
     recommendations for change at least 30 to 90 days prior to the AFLC meeting and serve
     as voting members of the AFLC.
     7.5.6.5. Functional Authority Force Development (FAFD) Lead. As the focal point for
     Airmen development within their functional areas, FAFD leads are O-6 level POCs who

                                             Chapter 8

                            EXPEDITIONARY SKILLS TRAINING

8.1. Program Description. Expeditionary Skills (ES) are defined as the knowledge, skills and
abilities (KSA) required of a deployment-ready Airman essential to prepare Airmen to survive,
operate, and succeed in a deployed environment, while reinforcing a strong warrior ethos. These
skills are obtained through a tiered training approach and target KSAs not routinely acquired
during occupational and/or other Ancillary Training venues. ES must be relevant, synchronized,
standardized and integrated across the AF to provide Combatant Commanders (CCDR) with
Airmen trained to support that theater‘s requirements, while maximizing resources. ES training is
optimized when incorporated as a continuum across an Airman‘s career and aligned with mission
tasking and deployments.
8.2. Requirements. ES are established IAW international treaties, law, DoD requirements,
Combatant Command (COCOM) requirements, and Headquarters Air Force policy. These
requirements are vetted and validated by the Headquarters Air Force Expeditionary Skills Senior
Review Group (ESSRG). An enduring element of our National Security Strategy is to engage
forward in peace, crisis and war. However, not all ES requirements are enduring and skills must
be reassessed and modified to adapt to current threats, environments, and missions. The Air
Force must train like it fights and continually assess ES across the Continuum of Learning to
eliminate unwanted duplication.
8.3. Responsibilities. Each responsible agency will execute roles and responsibilities as listed
to satisfy ES requirements.
      8.3.1. AF/A3O. Serves as the overall HAF focal point for Expeditionary Skills Training
      (EST).
      8.3.2. AF/A1D. Serves as HAF OPR for EST construct/policy and alignment of
      Expeditionary Skills within the Continuum of Learning (CoL).
      8.3.3. AF/A4/7Z. Integrates oversight of Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) and is the
      focal point for all cross-functional ECS-related issues. Creates and maintains the ESSRG
      Charter which defines the membership and responsibilities of the supporting bodies, as well
      as criteria for evaluating and validating new and existing requirements. AF/A4/A7Z will also
      provide administrative support to the ESSRG as Secretariat and serve as Chair and
      Secretariat of the Expeditionary Skills Working Group (ESWG).
      8.3.4. Expeditionary Skills Senior Review Group (ESSRG). Establishes a corporate level
      systematic process through which Expeditionary Skills training requirements are identified
      and validated, and the actual training will be synchronized and efficiently administered. As a
      subordinate body to the Force Management and Development Council (FMDC), the ESSRG
      will make recommendations to the FMDC on ES-related issues requiring senior level Air
      Force oversight. The ESSRG also provides guidance and direction to its subordinate ES
      Working Group and approves or disapproves ES training recommendations submitted by the
      ES Working Group. The ESSRG will meet quarterly, or as necessary. The ESSRG will
      maintain a holistic perspective of expeditionary skills development for Airmen and vet all
      new ES training requirements prior to implementation. The ESSRG formally establishes
      HAF advocacy of ES initiatives as required, matching resources with validated requirements.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                         91


  The formal review and approval process will serve to ensure validated Air Force ES
  requirements are met and approved with resourced training programs.
  8.3.5. Expeditionary Skills Working Group (ESWG). The ESWG is the Air Force focal point
  for EST related injects, changes, or modifications, and will serve as ―gatekeeper‖ for the ES
  training process. The ESWG is empowered to study ES related issues, validate and determine
  the resource estimates of new requirements, explore potential offsets for new requirements,
  explore potential venues for new requirements, and develop recommendations on ES-related
  injects, changes, or modifications to the ESSRG. The ESWG will assign new validated
  requirements to Lead-MAJCOM (L-MAJCOM) to determine the best Tier placement and
  owning agency of new/revised EST requirements/courses. If a potential new ES requirement
  is determined to be MAJCOM or functionally specific, the ESWG will identify the
  appropriate HAF OPR or champion. The Chair may also begin discussion on ES-related
  topics via an ad hoc gathering of the ESWG. The ESWG is empowered to approve any ES-
  related recommendations for further development and close any issues presented if policies
  are already in place. This group will meet quarterly, or as needed.
  8.3.6. Air Education and Training Command (AETC). L-MAJCOM for EST. Responsible
  for executing HAF policy and guidance to standardize and synchronize Expeditionary Skills
  Training across all Tiers. The L-MAJCOM will use current processes and mechanisms
  established by the HAF to manage EST in the same manner as other USAF training. Where
  required, AETC will coordinate with HAF and MAJCOMs to create needed processes for
  planning, programming, and budgeting IAW HAF policy and guidance. AETC will
  implement HAF-directed policy and guidance to provide L-MAJCOM support for ES related
  training issues to USAF regional training centers and owning MAJCOMs that conduct EST.
  HQ AETC, as L-MAJCOM, will work through the ESSRG as a voting member, and HAF
  A3O as the USAF training advocate, to ensure ES training requirements are validated,
  programmed (as applicable), and resourced. AETC will accept new EST validated
  requirements from the ESSRG/ESWG and will determine the best Tier placement and
  owning agency. Once Tier placement/owning agency has been determined, AETC will work
  with the agency of the new/revised EST requirement/course. Additionally, HQ AETC will
  execute Tier 1 (and where applicable for AETC, Tier 2 and Tier 3 training).
  8.3.7. USAF Expeditionary Center (USAF EC). As the USAF Center of Excellence for
  expeditionary combat support education, training and exercises, the USAF EC plays a central
  role in USAF expeditionary skills training (EST). The USAF EC will work through the
  ESSRG as a voting member and AF/A3O (as the USAF training advocate) to ensure
  expeditionary training requirements are validated, programmed (as applicable), and
  resourced. The USAF EC is assigned, and is the primary agency for, advanced EST (Tier 4).
  The USAF EC/EOS will develop Tier 4 courses in coordination with the Combatant
  Commander/requesting agency, AETC (as L-MAJCOM) and the ESSRG (IAW ESSRG
  approved processes located on the ESSRG CoP). If the USAF EC cannot meet the
  requirement, they will forward recommendations/needs for additional resources to the
  ESSRG, in coordination with AETC and the requesting agency. In this role, the L-MAJCOM
  will support the USAF EC in rapidly meeting requirements. The USAF EC will be
  responsible for gathering, refining, and being the repository for ES Lessons Learned and
  Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP). The USAF EC will make these TTPs available
  to the entire Air Force and in particular will enable the inclusion of new and rapidly
 92                                                 AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


      emerging TTPs (as applicable) in all EST. The USAF EC will provide the L-MAJCOM with
      expert advice on the proper development and implementation of EST (to include TTPs). The
      USAF EC will further develop concepts and TTPs which support USAF forward operations
      in the spectrum from permissive through uncertain/hostile operating environments. The
      USAF EC will continue to develop and execute AMC-unique EST programs. To execute
      these responsibilities, the USAF EC will have the authority to coordinate with all relevant
      organizations, MAJCOM and/or agencies, and initiate the necessary dialogue to enhance
      collaboration and gain synergies across affected organizations as described in the USAF EC
      Charter.
8.4. Expeditionary Skills Training Tiers:
      8.4.1. Tier 1, Foundational Expeditionary Skills Training. ES for all Airmen delivered
      through accessions and initial occupational training, and sustained through developmental
      education. Primary focus is to help our Airmen establish a ―Strong Warrior Ethos‖ while also
      providing them a solid foundation for the KSA to prepare to survive, operate, and succeed in
      a deployed environment. Airmen gain skills through Basic Military Training, Officer
      Accession venues, the Air and Space Basic Course, and, to some degree, Initial Skills
      Training. Completion of this training alone does not produce a deployable Airman.
      8.4.2. Tier 2, Deployment-Ready Expeditionary Skills Training. ES for all Airmen delivered
      at the wing level in alignment with assigned AEF band. Completion of this training is a
      requirement to maintain mission-ready status to produce a deployment-ready Airman, up to
      and including a Major Combat Operation (MCO). Tier 2 is designed to ensure every Airman
      maintains proficiency and sustain readiness currency for deployment. Local commanders
      have maximum flexibility to efficiently execute Tier 2 training; however, they must execute
      Tier 2B training IAW the HQ AETC curriculum and HAF guidance. Tier 2 EST curriculum
      is centrally maintained, but executed at the local level to afford commanders maximum
      flexibility. A current list of Tier 2 training is available at AEF Online. Tier 2 is divided into
      A and B categories. Refer to AEF Online for Tier 2 training categories, requirements, and
      frequencies.
         8.4.2.1. Tier 2A, ES Proficiency Training. All Airmen will maintain ES proficiency by
         completing Tier 2A training as they prepare for their postured AEF vulnerability period
         (reference AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air and Space Expeditionary Forces). These
         requirements are fulfilled by completing the requisite computer-based training (CBT) on
         the Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) and hands-on training. These
         training requirements must be accomplished by all members in preparation for their
         assigned AEF vulnerability period, irrespective of actual deployment taskings. NOTE:
         ARC members not assigned to an AEF Band will accomplish Tier 2A training in
         accordance with the requirements available at AEF Online.
             8.4.2.1.1. Additionally, some Air Force units maintain a high state of readiness with
             regard to Tier 2A skills. Members of these units may be exempt from Tier 2A training
             for the duration of their assignment or attachment to these units; however, HAF
             Career Field or Functional Area Managers must request certification of these training
             programs from AETC/A3Q. Documentation must explain how unit training meets or
             exceeds Tier 2A training standards. Once AETC/A3Q certifies the curriculum meets
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           93


         Tier 2A requirements, exemption requests must be coordinated through the owning
         MAJCOM/directorate and submitted to ACC/A3O for decision.
     8.4.2.2. Tier 2B, Home Station Pre-Deployment Training. Commanders will provide
     Tier 2B training to those members tasked to deploy or to maintain mission-ready status to
     support and including an MCO. Tier 2B Home Station Pre-Deployment Training is a
     combination of ADLS, standardized classroom, and standardized hands-on instruction.
     Tier 2B will meet AF entry requirements for a standard AEF deployment to a permissive
     environment. Tier 2B will also serve as the prerequisite for Airmen to attend Tier 3 or
     Tier 4 training unless exempted by the MAJCOM or functional directing the training.
     Tier 2A ES proficiency items that are accomplished within the currency for Tier 2B will
     satisfy both requirements. NOTE: If directed response times in MISCAP or DOC
     statements preclude units from completing Tier 2B training requirements on a "just in
     time" basis, the owning MAJCOM/Directorate may direct this training to be completed
     on a recurring basis (i.e. annually).
         8.4.2.2.1. Battlefield Airmen (BA), as defined by AFPD 10-35, are organized,
         trained, and equipped to deliver distinctive expertise in a ground combat environment
         with unequaled accuracy, responsiveness, flexibility and persistence. ES mastery is
         inherent in BA-specific training. Therefore, Battlefield Airmen are exempt from Tier
         2B ES training when attached or assigned to units that provide Battlefield Airmen-
         capabilities.
         8.4.2.2.2. Some career fields/Air Force units maintain a high state of readiness and
         conduct training that meets or exceeds Tier 2B training requirements. While they are
         encouraged to incorporate approved syllabi for individual Tier 2B events into their
         training, AETC/A3Q will provide support and guidance to any career field/unit
         requesting use of an alternate syllabus. AETC/A3Q will ensure these training venues
         meet COCOM intent for standard presentation of forces with regard to institutional
         ES training. If the HAF CFM or MAJCOM FAM believes their curriculum meets or
         exceeds Tier 2B training requirements, they can request exemption through the
         owning MAJCOM/directorate and submit to ACC/A3O for decision after AETC/A3Q
         certifies the curriculum meets Tier 2B requirements.
         8.4.2.2.3. (DELETED)
  8.4.3. Tier 3, Advanced Expeditionary Skills Training (Mission Specific). Enhanced ES for
  select Airmen as determined by factors including: deployment location, threat assessment,
  specific mission, duty assignment, role, operation, or special requirement. Tier 3 training is
  focused on pre-deployment training that supports both traditional AEF taskings and non-
  traditional USAF missions that support other CCDR taskings. Completion of this advanced
  training prepares an Airman for a specific deployment tasking. Tier 3 training provides
  mission specific, expeditionary skills for the individual Airman and/or team, and often
  includes timely updates on the latest enemy TTPs, use of ranges for field training scenarios,
  and small team leadership opportunities that are not available at home station. Tier 3 training
  includes courses designed in response to organic Air Force need or CCDR-directed theater-
  specific requirements. Typically, Tier 3 training is directed and identified in the force
  generation process and will be defined in appropriate line remarks/reporting instructions.
  NOTE: Training defined in appropriate line remarks and reporting instructions determines
 94                                              AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


      the Tier 3 training requirements for General Officers (GO) and Senior Executive Service
      (SES) members.
         8.4.3.1. Some career fields conduct training that meets or exceeds Tier 3 training
         requirements. While they are encouraged to incorporate approved curriculum for
         individual Tier 3 events into their training, AETC/A3Q will provide support and
         guidance to any career field requesting use of an alternate curriculum. AETC/A3Q will
         ensure these training venues meet the COCOM‗s intent for standard presentation of
         forces with regard to ES training. If a HAF CFM or MAJCOM FAM believes their ES
         training meets or exceeds Tier 3 training requirements, they can have their course
         certified as meeting Tier 3 training requirements. Managers must request certification of
         these training programs from AETC/A3Q. Documentation must clearly explain how unit
         training meets or exceeds Tier 3 training standards. Once AETC/A3Q certifies the
         curriculum meets Tier 3 requirements, exemption requests must be coordinated through
         the owning MAJCOM/directorate and submitted to ACC/A3O for decision.
         8.4.3.2. Pre-deployment CST is not waiverable and will only be exempted in cases where
         an individual has previously completed required training within 12 months of current
         deployment required delivery date for combat airman skills training (CAST). An
         exemption may be requested through AETC/A3Q as lead MAJCOM for EST and
         ACC/A3O as the exemption approval authority. These guidelines are in accordance with
         Joint Sourcing Training & Oversight (JSTO). Joint Expeditionary Tasking /Individual
         Augmentee Airmen who require Army CST must attend prior to each deployment to
         ensure currency of training. Once a member redeploys they must attend Army CST again,
         if ULN required, prior to their next deployment.
      8.4.4. Tier 4, Advanced Expeditionary Skills Training (USAF EC Assigned). ES courses that
      are rapidly developed and fielded to train Airmen on skill sets needed to meet
      critical/emerging requirements. These courses are often not initially well defined and are
      subject to rapid curriculum change. Additionally, Tier 4 courses include those advanced
      training programs that are unique to a specific MAJCOM and/or functionally specific, such
      as HQ AMC‘s PHOENIX Raven course. These courses are taught and/or assigned to the
      USAF EC and other venues.
8.5. Pre-Deployment Training Determination. The model depicted in Attachment 15
determines which individuals will attend what courses prior to deployment. All Airmen will
receive Tier 1 training. All Airmen will receive Tier 2A training as they prepare for their
postured AEF vulnerability period. Only Airmen tasked to deploy (or who maintain MR status
for an MCO) will receive Tier 2B training. Airmen tasked to deploy to an uncertain/hostile
environment will receive Tier 3 training. Airmen who require advanced skill sets to meet critical
or emerging requirements will receive Tier 4 training.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                             95

                                 TRAINING EVALUATION

9.1. Scope. Training providers evaluate formal courses, CDCs, and other training, as applicable,
to ensure currency and effectiveness.
9.2. Evaluation Responsibilities:
   9.2.1. HQ AF/A1DLT monitors the evaluation of recruit, formal, and Ancillary Training.
   9.2.2. HQ AU/A4L will develop and implement an evaluation program for CDCs. HQ
   AU/A4L will summarize evaluation data and ensure the information is available to the
   training activity responsible for preparing the course.
   9.2.3. MAJCOM organizations that operate formal courses and prepare CDCs will develop
   procedures to evaluate their education and training programs.
   9.2.4. Supervisors and Trainers:
       9.2.4.1. Evaluate formal course graduates to ensure training effectiveness. During the
       first 90 days following assignment, evaluate as a minimum:
           9.2.4.1.1. Military bearing.
           9.2.4.1.2. Technical ability. Using the Specialty Training Standard (STS) contained
           in the CFETP, evaluate the graduate‘s ability to perform tasks taught in the formal
           course at the specified training level.
       9.2.4.2. Use the Customer Service Information Line listed in the CFETP to report
       training deficiencies identified during the initial evaluation. Document the deficiencies in
       the graduates‘ AF Form 623a or automated version.
       9.2.4.3. When requested, use evaluation results to complete the AETC Graduate
       Assessment Survey (GAS) or Field Evaluation Questionnaire (FEQ) to provide feedback
       on the quality of formal course graduates. The GAS is sent to supervisors of graduates
       approximately 90 days after graduation. FEQs are conducted every 2 years (initial skill,
       AFSC awarding and mandatory 7-level courses) and are sent to supervisors of graduates
       4 to 6 months following graduation.
       9.2.4.4. Participate in field interviews conducted by formal course OPRs. Interviews are
       conducted 4 to 6 months after graduation.
   9.2.5. MAJCOM customers of training systems initiate requests for special evaluation
   projects by justifying and routing the request through the using command headquarters to the
   headquarters of the MAJCOM conducting the education or training.

Terms
Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)—An evolving, outcomes-focused approach to
education, training, and performance aiding that blends standards-based distributed learning
models emphasizing reusable content objects, content and learning management systems,
performance support systems/devices, web applications services, and connectivity. ADL is an
evolution of distributed learning (distance learning) that emphasizes collaboration on standards-
based versions of reusable objects, networks, and learning management systems, yet may include
some legacy methods and media. ADL is structured learning that takes place without requiring
the physical presence of an instructor. Although the AF uses the term advanced distributed
learning, some federal agencies and DoD components may use the term distance learning. These
terms refer to the same basic concept.
Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS)—ADLS is the system that delivers ADL
content and tracks & reports student progress.

    A3.1.1. Preface.
          A3.1.1.1. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that
          identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and
          minimum requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear
          career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE:
          Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position
          qualification training.
          A3.1.1.2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors plan, manage, and control
          training within the specialty using both parts of the plan.
             A3.1.1.2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the
             specialty. Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies
             career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies,
120                                             AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


         and career path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications
         (knowledge, education, training, experience, and other mandatory requirements); and
         Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower,
         equipment, and facilities.
         A3.1.1.2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the CTS, TRs to
         support training, AETC conducted training, and correspondence course requirements.
         Section B identifies training course index supervisors can use to determine resources
         available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses;
         Section C identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification
         Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training.
         Section D identified MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to
         determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. At unit
         level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training
         commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.
      A3.1.1.3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty
      receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan
      will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.
  A3.1.2. General Information.
      A3.1.2.1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs,
      MAJCOM functional managers (MFM), training management, supervisors and trainers to
      plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training
      program. The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to
      develop and progress throughout their career. For purposes of this plan, training is
      divided into entry level, upgrade, and proficiency training. Initial skills training is
      mandatory training for upgrade to qualified for officers. Normally, this training is
      conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies
      the mandatory courses, qualification requirements, and educational requirements for
      award of the intermediate (2), qualified (3) or staff (4) level. Proficiency training is
      additional training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond
      the minimum required for upgrade.
      A3.1.2.2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFM and supervisors at all levels to ensure
      comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the
      specialty.
         A3.1.2.2.1. AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident,
         nonresident, field and exportable training based upon requirements established by the
         users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM
         to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the
         identified training.
         A3.1.2.2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP
         mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, and
         contract training or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.
         MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion
         into the plan.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                         121


        A3.1.2.2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements
        specified in this plan. The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to
        support training.
     A3.1.2.3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the
     AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.
     MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on
     the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will
     eliminate duplicate training.
  A3.1.3. Section B—Career Progression and Information.
     A3.1.3.1. Specialty Description.
        A3.1.3.1.1. Specialty Summary. Refer to the Air Force Officer Classification
        Directory, (AFOCD), paragraph 1.
        A3.1.3.1.2. Duties and Responsibilities. Refer to AFOCD, paragraph 2. List duties
        and responsibilities individually and describe.
     A3.1.3.2. Skill and Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from
     the entry to the intermediate or qualified level play an important role in the AF‘s ability
     to accomplish its mission. It is essential everyone involved in training must do his or her
     part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided
     in this part of the CFETP would ensure each individual receives viable training at
     appropriate points in their career.
        A3.1.3.2.1. Entry (1) Level. (Provide an outline of activities for award of this level
        and to progress to the next level. Activities may consist of academic or experience
        requirements).
        A3.1.3.2.2. Intermediate (2) Level. (Provide an outline of activities for award of this
        level and to progress to the next level. Activities may consist of academic or
        experience requirements).

        Activities may consist of academic or experience requirements).
     A3.1.3.3. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to
     complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the (identify
     name of AFS) career field. The spectrum includes a strategy of training requirements for
     when, where, and how to meet the training requirements in a specific time period (if
     applicable). The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of
     training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. (Place a comment identifying
     where the training decisions were made).
        A3.1.3.3.1. Initial Skills. (Initial and Entry level training will usually be developed
        and taught by AETC).

   A4.1.1. Preface.
      A4.1.1.1. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that
      identifies life cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and
      minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a
      clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.
      NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position
      qualification training.
      A4.1.1.2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors plan, manage, and control
      training within the specialty using both parts of the plan.
          A4.1.1.2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the
          specialty. Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies
          career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies,
          and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications
          (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); and Section D indicates
          resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities;
          Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.
          A4.1.1.2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty
          Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, TRs to support training, AETC
          conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course
          requirements. Section B: contains the COL and training standards supervisors will use
          to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C: identifies available
          support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package, which may be
          developed to support proficiency training; Section D identifies a training course index
          supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included
          here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique
          training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for
          the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part
          II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this
          plan.
      A4.1.1.3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty
      receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan
      will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.
   A4.1.2. General Information.
      A4.1.2.1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs,
      MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors
      and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field
      training program. The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in
      order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills,
      upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS
130                                             AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


      specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this
      specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at
      one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses,
      task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for
      award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill level. Qualification training is actual hands-on task
      performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This
      training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed
      to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced
      training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is
      additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-
      job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the
      minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes—some are:
         A4.1.2.1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a
         career field-training program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at
         the appropriate point in an individual‘s career.
         A4.1.2.1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in
         the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an
         individual‘s career.
         A4.1.2.1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty identifies sources of
         training, and the training delivery method.
         A4.1.2.1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of
         the desired career field training process.
      A4.1.2.2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure
      comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the
      specialty.
         A4.1.2.2.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident,
         nonresident, field and exportable training based upon requirements established by the

A4.2. Part II.
   A4.2.1. Section A—Specialty Training Standard (STS).
       A4.2.1.1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by
       AETC for classes beginning (date) and graduating (date).
       A4.2.1.2. Purpose. As prescribed, this STS (refer to Figure A4.2 through Figure A4.5):
           A4.2.1.2.1. Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the
           most common tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for
           Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Number task statements
           sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1 Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*),
           specialty-wide training requirements.
           A4.2.1.2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of
           tasks and knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management
           systems to document technician qualifications, if available. Task certification must
           show a certification or completed date. (As a minimum, use the following column
           designators: Training Complete, Certifier Initials)
           A4.2.1.2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column
           4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of
           training on the task and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the
           correspondence course.
           A4.2.1.2.4. Qualitative Requirements. Figure A4.3 contains the proficiency code key
           used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and
           CDCs. (For this template, refer to Figure A4.3).
           A4.2.1.2.5. Use to document task when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job
           Training Record, and according to Chapter 6 of this instruction.
           A4.2.1.2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted
           Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are
           developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by senior NCOs with
           extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of
           STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most
           appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study
           references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of
           AFI 36-2605, AF Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the
           ANG.

 Explanations * A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance
 scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b) ** A
 subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not
 directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks. This mark is
 used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the
 course or CDC. X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required
 but not given due to limitations in resources. Note: All tasks and knowledge items shown with
 a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

 K          to identify facts, state principles, analyze, or evaluate the subject.
            Performance Training - Identifies that the individual has performed the task to the
 P          satisfaction of the course; however, the individual may not be capable of meeting
            the field requirements for speed and accuracy.
            Performance Knowledge Training - The verb selection identifies the individual‘s
 pk         ability to relate simple facts, procedures, operating principles, and operational
            theory for the task.
 -          No training provided in the course or CDC.
 X           Training is required but not provided due to limitations in resources.

NOTE: When developing your STS only identify applicable columns. For example, if you do not
have a QTP for your AFS then you do not need to develop a column as identified above. Also, if
you do not have a course or CDC for a particular skill level then you would not need to develop a
column for course or CDC.
A4.2.2. Section B—COL.
        A4.2.2.1. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or
        subject knowledge, which is measured using a written test. PC indicates required task
        performance, which is measured with a performance progress check. P indicates required
        task performance, which is measured with a performance test. PC/W indicates separate
        measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a
        performance progress check.
        A4.2.2.2. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for
        performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual
        progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check,
        and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory
        performance is attained.
        A4.2.2.3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the ―2b‖ proficiency
        level, which means the student can do most parts of the task but does need assistance on
        the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-
        step procedures for doing the task.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD SUBJECT: 3S2X1 Occupational Analysis Report
Development
1. On 11 January 2009 at 1330, I met with Mr. Bill Jones, AETC/A3-OA, in his office to discuss
the details of AETC/A3-OA providing an OAR for AFSC 3S2X1 (Education and Training). At
his request, I briefed him on the rationale for the OAR. Our meeting results are as follows:
a. Current data for an OAR for AFSC 3S2X1 exists and an OAR can be produced when needed.
Data received from the recent survey of AFSC 3S2X1 is being compiled, but time is needed to
reconcile against the current OAR.
2. The 3S2X1 OAR will include the following five reports:
(1) A task listing with data reflecting percentile of personnel performing, task difficulty, task
emphasis, and Automated Training Indicator (ATI).
(2) A task emphasis report rating tasks in descending order of emphasis (most to least
emphasized). This report will also reflect data illustrating percentile of personnel performing,
task difficulty, and ATI.
(3) A task difficulty report rating tasks in descending order of difficulty (most to least difficult).
This report will also include data reflecting percentile of personnel performing, task emphasis,
and ATI.
(4) An ATI report rating tasks in descending order of plausibility for training in an initial skills
(3-skill level) course (most to least plausible). This report will also reflect data illustrating
percentile of personnel performing, task difficulty, and task emphasis.
(5) An STS matching report listing all tasks as they line up on the STS. This report will also
reflect data illustrating percentile of personnel performing, task emphasis, and ATI. To produce
this report, the training manager at the technical training center will assist AETC/A3-OA by
arranging for Subject Matter Experts (SME) to align the tasks under the appropriate STS line
entries. SMEs can come from our office or the technical school.
3. The meeting concluded at 1400.

          GUIDE FOR INTERVIEWING PROSPECTIVE 3S2X1 RETRAINEES

A9.1. Purpose. The purpose of this guide is to provide additional information for interviewers
of personnel interested in retraining into AFSC 3S2X1 (Education and Training). This
information goes beyond the AF classification system of requirements and procedures for
retraining. Use this guide to provide an overview of the various jobs within the AFSC and entry
requirements.
A9.2. Introduction. Being a training manager in today's AF is a very demanding, yet
rewarding job, if approached with a positive attitude and a willingness to serve. Anyone desiring
to become a training manager must understand what the AFSC encompasses and requires.
A9.3. Information. As with any major decision in life, gain as much information as possible
before making a final decision. Gather information from the following sources:
   A9.3.1. Review AFECD, specialty description outlining 3S2X1 AFSC duties and
   responsibilities.
   A9.3.2. Review the current 3S2X1 Part II of the CFETP for general task requirements of the
   AFSC. Technical references and functional publications relating to the duty position, i.e.,
   AFI 36-2201, provide specific guidance.
   A9.3.3. Consider the need to work with people and communicate effectively both orally and
   in writing.
   A9.3.4. Consider the need to deal effectively with personnel at all levels, especially
   commanders and supervisors.
   A9.3.5. Techniques for skills such as guiding, persuading, counseling, advising, assisting,
   educating, and instructing are essential for success.
   A9.3.6. The initial mandatory AFS training is Education and Training Apprentice Course
   (E3ALR3S231-0A1A, PDS Code 472). Additionally, technical or academic instructor
   courses are helpful.
A9.4. Different Jobs. Next, a review of the different positions is in order. There are basically
three distinguishable areas in the AFSC; training and related training program development and
management, formal instructing and related training activities, and support of voluntary
education policy and programs. Within these three areas exist at least seven common variations
of jobs:
   A9.4.1. Unit Training Manager (UTM).
   A9.4.2. Aircraft or Missile Maintenance Training Manager.
   A9.4.3. Base Training Manager.
   A9.4.4. MAJCOM TM.
   A9.4.5. Instructor.
   A9.4.6. Education Services Manager.
   A9.4.7. ISD/Curriculum Development.
 170                                             AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


A9.5. Unit Training Manager (UTM). Being assigned as a UTM is one of the most
challenging places to begin in the AFSC. This is the grass roots level of the training environment
and a great place to learn the basics of the AFS. AFI 36-2201 outlines the many duties associated
with this important position. In this job, you interact daily with personnel at all levels. Your
position in the unit is extremely vital to the mission. The way you do business and conduct
yourself greatly impacts the effectiveness of the training program. Being a leader and a
professional is a necessity.
A9.6. Aircraft or Missile Maintenance Training Manager. There are at least two variations
of unit training management, working solely in a unit situation or at group level in a centralized
or consolidated aircraft maintenance or missile maintenance training activity. Most often they are
responsible for both unit and group training programs. You must accomplish the basic unit
training management requirements, as outlined by this AFI, and other related duties through the
use of automated training management systems and appropriate maintenance training directives.
A9.7. Base Training Manager. Working in the FSM Base Training Office as a Base Training
Manager is definitely in the mainstream of the AFSC. Interaction takes place with all serviced
units, directly with the personnel community, and up the chain with higher headquarters.
Previous unit level experience of at least one to two years is preferable before working in this
capacity. It‘s important to be knowledgeable concerning personnel policies and procedures
relating to manning, promotion, classification, and retraining. Duties also include using the
automated Personnel Data System.
A9.8. MAJCOM TM. Working at a MAJCOM requires extensive experience and a broad
view; a person new to the AFSC should not work there. Duties include interaction with staff
functions as well as the technical aspects of managing training programs on a command-wide
basis.
A9.9. Instructor. A different and significant duty available is instructing in a formal technical
or academic environment. Most positions are available in AETC and require submission of a
special duty application. Before beginning teaching duties, instructors must attend either a Basic
Instructor Course or Academic Instructor School.
A9.10. Education Services Manager. Duties in an Education Services Center as an Education
Services Manager are challenging and rewarding. Your exposure to a myriad of tasks will
require flexibility to successfully accomplish them. Good communication and customer service
skills are important characteristics to possess. You will assume responsibilities including
working with tuition assistance, obligating and recouping funds, scheduling education and
training activities, testing and counseling appointments, and equipment and classroom use.
A9.11. ISD/Curriculum Development. The duties associated with ISD/Curriculum
Development are the most technically challenging within the AFSC. The majority of positions
are in AETC or in organizations with training or education as its primary mission. Duties include
conducting job skill assessments, developing lesson plans and tests, and evaluating existing
courses through the instructional systems review process.
A9.12. Interview Checklist. This checklist highlights key areas to address when conducting an
interview and preparing the recommendation for retraining and reclassification.
   A9.12.1. The following areas are of interest to the interviewer:
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              171

       A9.12.1.4. AF career goals.
       A9.12.1.5. Prior experience in managing an Education and Training program or
       involvement as a trainer or supervisor.
   A9.12.2. Assess by available means (records, supervisor and commander interviews, etc) the
   ability to interact with people of varied grades and positions and to perform duties with little
   or no supervision.
   A9.12.3. Review EPRs for remarks concerning:
       A9.12.3.1. Duty Performance.
       A9.12.3.2. Human relations.
       A9.12.3.3. Learning ability.
       A9.12.3.4. Self-improvement efforts.
       A9.12.3.5. Adaptability to military life.
       A9.12.3.6. Bearing and behavior.

       A9.12.3.8. Supervisory experience (if applicable).
       A9.12.3.9. Acceptance of NCO responsibility (if applicable).
A9.13. Additional Considerations. The potential retrainee must possess qualification in any
AFSC at the 5-skill level or higher (or 3-skill level if no 5-skill level exists), and the ability to
speak clearly and distinctly. As a final check, the interviewer must review the following areas:
   A9.13.1. Potential retrainee‘s ability to communicate through writing.
   A9.13.2. Status of Unfavorable Information File (UIF) or Fitness Program participation, if
   applicable.

                   for entry in this TSC and advises them of the action required to qualify
                   for training at a later date (see Notes for processing instructions at the

                         reassignment, promotion or reenlistment. The commander will
                         evaluate members at 90 days and recommend action. For two-time
                         CDC failures refer to Table 6.1., Line 11. Document the evaluation in
                         writing, place a copy in the AF Form 623, and forward a copy to base
                         training. Keep Airmen in this TSC until reinstated, reclassified, or
                         separated. Note: Do not use this TSC instead of necessary
                         administrative or disciplinary action. Process case files for an Airman
                         recommended for withdrawal from training for failing to progress
                         (TSC T) according to option A, B, or C (see below). When processing
                         an AF Form 2096 placing a trainee in TSC T, a hard copy must be
                         forwarded to the FSM with the member‘s signature.
                         The applicable TSC has not been assigned or the gaining FSM has not
 16       Y              processed the Airman. Use this code for ANG personnel awaiting the
                         start of Basic Military Training School (BMTS).


OPTION A. If the commander and supervisor recommend withdrawal from UGT or mandatory
qualification training identified by the AFCFM, and justify the recommendation on AF Form
2096 with agreement from the base training office and the trainee, and base training approves:
(1) The commander enters the following statement in the remarks section of the AF Form 2096
and signs it along with the trainee: "I have been briefed on my ineligibility for promotion,
reenlistment, and reassignment while withdrawn from training and understand removal from
UGT may result in separation under the provisions of AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of
Airmen.‖ File one copy of the AF Form 2096 in the AF Form 623.
(2) The commander evaluates the individual to determine eligibility to reenter training at 90 days
for further action.
OPTION B. If the commander and supervisor recommend withdrawal from UGT, the AFSC, or
from mandatory qualification training identified by the AFCFM; and either the base training
office or trainee do not agree with the withdrawal:
(1) The Manpower Personnel Flight (FSM) chief (or designee) submits documents (last three
performance reports, training documentation, and medical evaluations, if appropriate) to the
parent MAJCOM with a cover letter recommending the course of action.
(2) The MAJCOM training manager coordinates with the MAJCOM FM to initiate one of the
following actions:
(a) Continue the Airman in training.

(b) Withdraw the Airman from UGT and continue in the present AFSC. If the MAJCOM
determines the trainee can progress in the AFSC, the commander (after evaluation) may allow
the Airman to reenter training at any time.
(c) Disqualify the Airman from the AFSC (see AFIs 36-2101 and 36-2626) and return to a
previously awarded AFS, if applicable, or recommend the Airman for retraining.

   MASTER TRAINING PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE USING INSTRUCTIONAL
                  SYSTEMS DESIGN (ISD) PRINCIPLES

A13.1. Master Training Plan (MTP). This attachment provides guidance for developing a
work center Master Training Plan (MTP). When developing your training plan make sure it
includes requirements identified in paragraph 6.7.1.2.
A13.2. Unit Training Program As applied to the unit training program, ISD consists of five
basic steps; analysis, design (master task list (MTL)), development (determining training needs
and capability), implementation (select training strategies and schedule training), and evaluation.
A13.3. Develop the Master Task List (MTL). The MTL is an integral part of your training
plan. It is a list of all required tasks in a work center and is a source from which you select tasks
for training and is a source from which you select tasks for developing individual CFETPs.
When developing the MTL identify all task requirements within your duty section or work center
to ensure 100 percent task coverage. This means identifying all tasks to include
contingency/wartime tasks, additional duties identified by the supervisor as a certifiable task, and
any mandatory core tasks required by the AFCFM. Documents used to develop the MTL include,
but are not limited to, the CFETP for all AFSCs within the work center; AF Forms 797 and 1098
(if applicable), automated forms, or forms required/approved by your MAJCOM.
   A13.3.1. Identifying Tasks. The following information provides guidance to assist in
   identifying tasks for your MTL.
   A13.3.2. Identify all normal day-to-day mission requirements. These are the tasks performed
   by personnel in your work center, to include required core tasks as defined by the AFCFM.
   A13.3.3. Identify Special Work Requirements. Some career fields have tasks that are not
   performed on a regular basis. This could encompass tasks performed infrequently, additional
   duty tasks, contingency tasks, Reserve Augmentation Duty (READY) Program, etc. Training
   references for these tasks include special operating instructions, local contingency plans, or
   the AF instructions governing the additional duty.
   A13.3.4. Determine Mandatory Qualifications. The CFETP and the Enlisted Classification
   Directory, may list additional requirements that must be met before an Airman is qualified to
   be upgraded. Refer to these for other mandatory tasks.
   A13.3.5. Recurring Training Requirements. Many AFSCs have tasks that require annual
   certification or recertification. Refer to the CFETP, governing directives, training manuals,
   etc. to determine recertification requirements for your AFSC.
   A13.3.6. Documenting the MTL. You may document the MTL in one of the following ways:
   A13.3.7. Coding. You may use color-coding, symbols, or other means to identify individual
   duty position requirements, core tasks, qualification tasks, additional duties, and so forth. It is
   advisable to also develop a legend to aid understanding when outside agencies, newly
   assigned personnel, or other supervisors in the work center are using or are initially exposed
   to the MTL. Be very careful when developing a coding system so you do not develop a rigid
   or inflexible training plan. Training plans must be flexible in order to meet manning,
 182                                              AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   equipment, or TDY fluctuations. Care should be taken to ensure all supervisors, trainers, and
   task certifiers can define and use the MTL.
   NOTE: It is advisable to identify tasks required for duty position rather than skill level task
   requirements.
   A13.3.8. Locally Developed Products. Unless otherwise directed by the AFCFM, any
   number of computer programs, such as Word, Excel, etc. may be used to develop your MTL.
   However, the CFETP must be used as the core document; other forms used to expand or list
   tasks not found in the CFETP are considered supplemental. These forms might include the
   AF Forms 797 and 1098.
A13.4. Determine Training Needs. Once the MTL has been developed you must determine the
training needs within your work center. To determine your training needs, you must:
   A13.4.1. Use the MTL to develop a Master Training Plan (MTP) as directed in paragraph
   6.5.4. An MTP is a guide for supervisors, trainers, and certifiers to ensure that personnel are
   trained in an effective and efficient manner to meet training and mission requirements.
   Considerations for MTP development will include; when tasks should be trained
   (priority/milestones), how they should be trained (resources/method), and approximately how
   long it should take to train on individual tasks or set of tasks.
   A13.4.2. Identify Requirements From Initial Evaluations. Once your MTL has been
   developed for your work center or section you will need to determine individual training
   requirements. Compare what the trainee knows or can perform against the tasks in the MTL.
   The difference between what the trainee can perform and the work center requirements is the
   individual‘s training requirements. Determine individual requirements in one of the
   following methods.
   A13.4.3. Initial evaluations. Using the MTL, identify what the trainee knows or can perform.
   If the trainee is a recent graduate from technical school compare the tasks in 3 -level course
   column to his/ her level of expertise. Match the qualification of the trainee to the
   requirements of the duty position. This will help identify what training is needed and how
   long it will take to upgrade the trainee. If the trainee can perform the task, without assistance,
   to 100 percent accuracy, nothing more needs to be done. If the trainee cannot perform the
   task to the current standards, circle the task as a training requirement and open training when
   training begins.
   A13.4.4. Review training previously received. If the Airman is assigned from another base
   or work center you will need to review the CFETP and verify trainee‘s ability to perform the
   tasks (if required in the new work center). Match the qualifications of the trainee against the
   predetermined standard in your MTP. If the trainee can perform the task, no further action is
   required. If the trainee cannot perform the task (or the standard/method of performance
   changed) and the task is required in the new work center, decertify the tasks IAW paragra ph
   6.8.8.4 and look to evaluate trainee‘s future training progress. It the trainee can perform the
   task, but the task is no longer required in the new duty position, erase the corresponding
   circles (but not the previous certification dates or initials).
   A13.4.5. Set Training Priorities. When setting training priorities, keep in mind some tasks
   require training before others. Other tasks may have a prerequisite task or knowledge
   requirements. For example, if the task is to measure electrical output of a socket, the trainer
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                                183


   might need to teach use of the multi-meter first. Deployment requirements, AEF tasks, and
   other factors driving the training need must also be considered when determining training
   requirements.
   A13.4.6. Plan for concurrent knowledge training. Most tasks require some type of
   background knowledge or skill. You may use the CDCs, AFIs, manufacturer‘s manuals,
   training references, or other materials to ensure the trainee has the knowledge base to
   perform the task.
A13.5. Training Capabilities and Resources. Determine Training Capabilities and Resources.
If you or others in your work center can perform the task, are certified in the applicable CFETP,
and have attended the AFTC, there is a training capability. However, if you feel there is no
method to provide the training, contact your unit training manager for assistance. The UTM will
contact Base Training to determine if the training can be provided within the base. If this is not
possible, Base Training will contact the MAJCOM for assistance.
   A13.5.1. Identify the most qualified trainers. In most cases, the trainer and supervisor are the
   same person. If this is not possible trainers may be appointed IAW guidance in paragraph
   6.7.2. Trainers may provide training to one trainee or small groups of trainees, depending on
   the task. The trainer must work the same shift as the trainee, must be given time to train, and
   must meet the requirements of paragraph 6.7.2.
   A13.5.2. If there is a training requirement for which you have no trainer or certifier, contact
   the Base Training Office. If the base training office cannot find a trainer/certifier locally, the
   MAJCOM training manager will be contacted for assistance.
A13.6. Select Training Strategies. The next step in the process is to decide how and where to
provide the training. What is the training objective? What is the best method for conducting
training? Is there a distance learning tool that can be utilized to assist in the training process? The
following questions may be used to assist in determining the best training method.

Table A13.1. Determining Training Strategy.
 Step                                                                               Yes No       N/A
 (1) Do you need classroom time?
 (2) Does the knowledge in the CDC meet some of your training
 requirements?
 (3) Can the trainer train more than one trainee at a time?
 (4) Can training be conducted without equipment downtime?
 (5) Is related background training available from another source?
 (6) Can regularly scheduled work be conducted at the same time as the
 training?
 (7) Can the training be conducted in one session?
 (8) Are special training aids required?
 (9) Will special training sessions be required?
 (10) Do all trainees need to be trained on the same task?
 184                                                AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


 Step                                                                      Yes No                 N/A
 (11) When must training be completed to assure work center continuity and
 mission effectiveness?
 (12) Can the training be accomplished through distance learning or web-
 based training?

A13.7. Develop training objectives. What must the trainee do or know in order to be
considered qualified? A training objective must define the resultant behavior (what the trainee
must do or know), the standard (how well the task must be performed), and the condition (what
will be given or denied during the final evaluation).
A13.8. Develop Lesson guides and task breakdowns. Some tasks are complicated, extremely
large, or confusing. Some tasks are so simple that no further training need be conducted.
    A13.8.1. When planning training for a large task, you need to break the task down into
    smaller, teachable units that will provide for a number of successes for the trainee and is
    short enough to complete in one session.
    A13.8.2. Some tasks take several days or weeks to complete; therefore you will need to be
    able to teach it in several sessions. Not all tasks require a breakdown. If there is a regulation
    or manual that provides step-by-step procedures, evaluation steps, checklists, etc, no task
    breakdown is required.
    A13.8.3. However, reference your training source in the MTL. If the task is covered under
    several regulations or manuals, is not covered under any regulations or manuals, is lengthy or
    complicated, a task breakdown or lesson guide is advisable.
    A13.8.4. A well-designed task breakdown can also serve as an evaluation tool during the
    evaluation phase.
A13.9. Schedule Training. Scheduled training gets priority attention. To the greatest extent
possible training should coincide with work schedules. However, when this is not possible,
schedule training far enough in advance that supervisors have enough time to schedule their
trainees to attend. To the greatest extent possible training should be scheduled in writing.
A13.10. Evaluate Training. After training has been conducted allow trainees time to practice
what has been learned. The trainer will determine when the trainee is ready to be certified on the
task. If no third party certification is required, training is certified complete by the trainer. If the
task requires third party certification, the training is certified complete after the task certifier
conducts the task evaluation.

       DL POC RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MANAGING, ADMINISTERING, AND
                            CONDUCTING DL

A17.1. Managing and Controlling DL Materials.
   A17.1.1. Base DL POCs. MAJCOM appointed individuals who serve as the central point of
   contact at the local level to manage DL. Recommend the POC be within the mission support
   squadron, education services function. Particular tasks may be delegated by the DL POC, as
   appropriate. However, the base DL POC is responsible for ensuring that all tasks are
   accomplished.
   A17.1.2. Inventory shipments and verify the amount matches the annual screening request.
   Course materials for out-of-cycle requirements are received on a continuing basis and will be
   inventoried using the same procedures.
   A17.1.3. Verify required contents (correct version of handout materials, written exercises,
   answer keys, and final examinations) were received and undamaged. Notify the appropriate
   distribution function of any damaged or missing material.
   A17.1.4. Establish a base DL library for high-flow courses. Determine the need for a high-
   flow course library by analyzing historical enrollment trend data.
A17.2. Managing Controlled Examination Material.
   A17.2.1. The Mission Support Squadron Commander will appoint, by letter, a primary and
   alternate Base DL Test Control Officer (TCO). DL POCs may also be designated as TCOs.
   A17.2.2. Base DL TCOs will inventory all incoming examination material, sign and return
   confirmation of receipt.
   A17.2.3. Note any discrepancies on the packing slip.
   A17.2.4. Maintain and inventory monthly all controlled exam materials in secure containers
   (safe or locked filing cabinet).
A17.3. DL Scheduling and Administration Procedures. The majority of DL courses are designed
to be self-paced, asynchronous and do not require scheduling. Other DL courses such as those
delivered via webinar and ITV are synchronous, designed to include interactivity with other
students and may be group-paced. The AETC TM validates and schedules synchronous courses
as applicable. (NOTE: Refer to the course announcement in ETCA and the Technical Training
Distance Learning Course Guide (Live Guide) at the 2 AF site on the AF Portal for information
on specific courses.)
   A17.3.1. Based on monthly projected training requirements forwarded by the UTM, the
   Base DL POC verifies availability of course material to support student enrollment and
   coordinates a scheduled date of enrollment in approved training, as required. UTMs direct
   students to the base DL POC for issue of student course materials.
   A17.3.2. Prior to student enrollment in a DL course, UTMs ensure students meet course
   prerequisites and that students are informed of unfurnished course materials (e.g., Technical
   data, etc.) as outlined in ETCA.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                       191


  A17.3.3. Self-paced DL Courses. Self-paced DL courses are delivered via IBI, CD-ROM,
  paper or a combination of media.
     A17.3.3.1. Internet Based Courses. Internet DL courses are available on the AETC
     Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS). Students may self-enroll in IBI courses
     via ADLS IAW ETCA, notify the DL POC if they need additional materials and when
     ready to test, as applicable. EXCEPTION: For 7-Level Craftsman IBI courses, the
     student will be directly notified by the appropriate agency and self-enroll via ADLS, as
     directed.
     A17.3.3.2. CD-ROM and Paper-based Courses. UTMs direct students to the DL POC for
     enrollment in these courses. If the DL POC maintains a Base DL Library, materials for
     these courses may be used as requested by students. Upon course completion, if students
     are required to complete a test, they must contact the DL POC. The DL POC will
     administer the test and the feedback questionnaire, maintain test security and complete
     final administrative details IAW course instructions. (Similar to procedures for CBT and
     ITV described in the next paragraphs.)
     A17.3.3.3. Computer-based Training (CBT). The base DL POC ensures availability and
     operability of computer laboratory, issues course materials, and explains course
     completion requirements. DL POC will:
        A17.3.3.3.1. Prepare a preliminary course enrollment by completing appropriate
        form and forward (via fax or other approved encrypted electronic transfer procedures)
        to the appropriate training group OPR.
        A17.3.3.3.2. Monitor use of computer laboratory equipment, and student progress
        during course. Use appropriate form to report changes of student status and class
        changes to the appropriate training group OPR. For example, if a student does not
        complete the course or does not complete it within the allotted time, complete
        appropriate form to report requests or recommendations for student withdrawals or
        extensions to the appropriate AETC training group OPR. The training group makes
        the final decision on student status. (Additional documentation may be required by
        the training group for eliminations, withdrawals of other student status changes.)
        Gather student elimination and withdrawal information by assisting students who do
        not complete a course or do not complete it within the allotted time in completing the
        Elimination Survey. Send the completed survey to the appropriate training group
        OPR.
        A17.3.3.3.3. Issue the final examination, monitor student during testing, and record
        final results on appropriate form. If the student completes the final examination
        through the computer, and the computer program automatically calculates the test
        score, the Base DL POC must verify results.
        A17.3.3.3.4. Administer course feedback questionnaires by directing students to the
        applicable online survey website. Conduct follow-up on any discrepancies identified
        falling within the receive site‘s purview and provide status to appropriate AETC
        OPR.
        A17.3.3.3.5. Maintain security of test materials IAW course instructions.
192                                          AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


         A17.3.3.3.6. Complete appropriate form, sign and forward along with appropriate
         course material, IAW course instructions.
      A17.3.3.4. The appropriate OPR in the training group verifies student course completion
      and provides graduation certificates to the DL POC for distribution to UTMs. UTMs
      update course completion to CAMS and/or TEMs, if appropriate.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                       193

       ―MAJCOM Priority‖ course until it extinguishes the host backlog.
   A19.4.3. Personnel resolve conflicting schedules that affect multiple host units at monthly
   TD-host scheduling meetings.
       A19.4.3.1. MAJCOMs apply the priority ratings of AFI 16-301, US Air Force Priority
       System for Resources Management, to resolve disagreements.
A19.5. Funding for 982 TRG TD Courses to include enroute training. Travel and per diem cost
for students travel to off station TD courses is submitted to 982 TRG, Sheppard AFB, TX for
funding approval. The system of record for all funding requests is the Defense Travel System
(DTS). The required actions for scheduling a class and obtaining funding are listed in A19.5.1.
   A19.5.1. Procedures for Obtaining Funding from 982 TRG for TD Courses are as follows.
       A19.5.1.1. The Logistics Training Flight (LTF) scheduler will schedule a class to meet
       Unit personnel requirements by contacting a teaching FTD. NOTE: Teaching FTD
       information for each course can be obtained using https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
       A19.5.1.2. LTF will forward course name, course number, and course PDS (course
       information) to scheduled student to use when entering request into DTS.
       A19.5.1.3. Scheduled student should enter request for travel orders into DTS NLT 10
       duty days prior to Class Start Date (CSD). Requests submitted less than 10 duty days
       prior to CSD will be worked as time permits, timely approval will be attempted by 982
       TRG but orders cannot be guaranteed.
       A19.5.1.4. Traveler must enter course information into the ―comments to approving
       official‖ section to enable 982 TRG/TXTGA to process funding eligibility.
       A19.5.1.5. If funding request includes items that are not payable by 982 TRG lines of
       accounting (LOA) the traveler must include a unit LOA to enable these items to be
       charged to the applicable source. Items not covered by 982 TRG are listed in A5.5.3.
       A19.5.1.6. Student will select 982TRG TDY Training routing list in DTS to ensure
       request is sent to 982 TRG/TXTGA for approval. NOTE: If 982TRG TDY Training
       routing list is not a traveler option, 982 TRG/RA must be contacted at DSN 736-4729 to
       have this option added to their organizational account.
       A19.5.1.7. 982 TRG/TXTGA will review request for student eligibility. If Student is
       eligible the request will be stamped ―reviewed‖ and sent to 982 TRG/RA. If the request is
 198                                             AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


       disapproved the request will be stamped ―returned‖ and applicable notes will be included
       to indicate next course of action for scheduled student.
       A19.5.1.8. 982 TRG/RA will review request forwarded by 982 TRG/TXTGA for
       funding eligibility. If request meets all funding requirements the request will be stamped
       ―approved‖ and DTS will notify the traveler that request is complete. If the request does
       not meet funding requirements the request will be stamped ―returned‖ and applicable
       notes will be included to indicate next course of action for scheduled student.
   A19.5.2. If an individual cannot attend the TD course after the request is submitted through
   DTS, the LTF Scheduler must notify teaching DET and 982 TRG/RA as soon as possible so
   appropriate action can take place.

   to the following and are requesting unit responsibility at the discretion of 982 TRG/CC:
   Authorization for a special conveyance (i.e., rental car)
   Vicinity mileage for POV and/or rental vehicles at TDY location
   Off-base lodging differential, regardless of on base availability, 982 TRG will cover up to the
   authorized on base amount only. Non-availability letters issued by lodging office will result
   in the requesting unit being liable for off base differential.
A19.6. Types of training not covered by 982 TRG:
   A19.6.1. All partial courses or training sessions. NOTE: Partial/incomplete courses resulting
   from unscheduled events, i.e. emergency leave will be covered by 982 TRG.
   A19.6.2. Courses where on-base billeting cannot be obtained and requesting unit does not
   supply a line of accounting to cover the off base differential. NOTE: If on-base billeting
   cannot be arranged, the requesting unit will be asked to fund the differential cost of on-base
   versus off-base billeting.

       cannot be finalized before departure, will be sent to the Airman‘s TDY location.
       Personnel records will be hand-carried by all students according to AFI 36-2608, Military
       Personnel Records System, and turned in to the end assignment MPS during in
       processing.
       A20.5.1.5. Ensures that students with end assignments overseas arrive at continental
       United States (CONUS) training locations before oversea movement.
   A20.5.2. Phase II Servicing MPS:
       A20.5.2.1. Servicing MPS/DPMUOS at Phase II training locations. Advises end-
       assignment training management office (MAT) and AFPC/DPAAS2 of delays of TDY
       students.
       A20.5.2.2. Servicing MPS/DPMUM at end-assignment. Gains members to its files.
       A20.5.2.3. Servicing MPS/DPMPC at end-assignment. Ensures the three-skill level is
       awarded on the initial duty assignment.
   A20.5.3. ARF MPS:
       A20.5.3.1. Publish orders for ARF personnel covering the entire period to TDY to
       include total training itinerary.
       A20.5.3.2. Publish all amendments to ARF students‘ orders. In case of limited time,
       amendments may be made by message to the appropriate AETC training wing servicing
       MPS.
A20.6. Multi-phase Training Procedures:
   A20.6.1. Student Management—PCS to End-Assignment. The gaining squadron
   commanders will have morale, welfare, UCMJ, billeting, and all other normal reporting
   responsibilities. Refer to the ETCA web https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ for further guidance
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          203


  on administrative and reporting instructions. Phase II training has priority over all base
  incoming newcomers treatment and orientation (INTRO), First Term Airman Center
  (FTAC), and ancillary training. NOTE: Not applicable to Air Reserve Component (ARC)
  personnel.
  A20.6.2. TDY En route to End-Assignment. Students will be assigned to the host unit for
  administrative support and for duty with TD. En route bases will schedule departures (port
  call) for TDY airmen in excess of 30 days.
  A20.6.3. Billet TDY multiphase trainees IAW AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing
  Management.
  A20.6.4. Students will hand carry personnel records. PCS end-assignment students will turn
  in records to the servicing MPS upon in processing. TDY students will retain records until
  reporting to final end-assignment. EXCEPTION: students eliminated from courses for cause
  will turn records into the servicing MPS.
  A20.6.5. Ordinary leave between phases of training will not normally be granted. Exceptions
  to this policy are at the discretion of the training squadron commander after coordination
  with 373 TRS/TXFR and 82 MSS/DPMAA. Leave authorization after arrival at the gaining
  base will be at the discretion of the gaining squadron commander. Ordinary leave should not
  delay entry into training and therefore will not normally be granted until completion of the
  TD training. Leave between completion of TD training at an en route base and proceeding to
  gaining base will be coordinated between the TDY host unit and gaining squadron
  commander.
  A20.6.6. Trainee Skill-Level Upgrade:
     A20.6.6.1. End-Assignment. Upon completion of Phase II training, the TD will prepare
     AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, and the appropriate record of student accounting
     and attendance. The host unit will submit the classification action for the award of 3-skill
     level and entry into 5-skill level upgrade training.
     A20.6.6.2. Personnel bound for overseas will be awarded the 3-skill level before
     departing the CONUS. The gaining MPS will enter airmen into upgrade training to the 5-
     skill level.
  A20.6.7. Personnel Strength Accounting Procedures. HQ USAF and base level military
  personnel systems account for individuals by skill level (one- or three-level) currently held.
  Procedures will vary depending on where an Airman completed Phase II training—either at
  the gaining base or TDY en route. Using the personnel transaction identifier PTI 517, the
  technical training graduate match program calculates a report-not-later-than-date that is equal
  to the graduation date from the basic technical training course, plus travel time, plus leave,
  plus the course length for TD training. It is essential that airmen be gained in the proper
  control Air Force specialty code (CAFSC) (one-or three-level) to ensure accurate
  classification and statistical accountability.
  A20.6.8. PCS to End-Assignment. Airmen will be gained (PTI 201/204) in the one-skill
  level primary Air Force specialty code and CAFSC; functional category will be ―L‖. Upon
  completion of TD, the above applies. Airmen‘s PAFSC and CAFSC will be upgraded to the
  three-skill level. Update functional category to ―A‖.
204                                             AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


  A20.6.9. TDY En Route to End-Assignment. Airmen who have completed TD before arrival
  at their end-assignment (for example, all oversea bound airmen) will be awarded the three-
  skill level in their appropriate AFSCs (see above).
  A20.6.10. Student Elimination Management Quality Control. Airmen who fail to complete
  any portion of initial skill multiphase training will be evaluated for either separation or
  retention. Non-prior service (NPS) students, eliminated from Phase I courses, reporting
  instructions are covered in AFI 36-2110, Assignments. Process retraining students according
  to HQ AETCI 36-2215, Training Administration or AETCI 36-2205 Volume 1, Formal
  Flying Training Administration and Management t, and AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining
  Program. When a student is eliminated from Phase II training, the TD commander will notify
  the unit commander by letter. If the student is from the Air National Guard, provide an
  information copy to NGB/TE, Wash DC 20330. If an AF Reserve Airman is eliminated,
  return the student to the unit of assignment for disposition.
      A20.6.10.1. When an active duty NPS student is eliminated from the TD phase of
      training and retention is recommended, the following procedures apply: NOTE:
      Retrainee eliminees are processed as explained in AFI 36-2626.
      A20.6.10.2. When training is conducted at the end-assignment, the MPS, in conjunction
      with the TD, initiates the message required by AFI 36-2110, and sends it to 2 AF Det 1,
      with information copies To AFPC/DPAAS2, and MAJCOM/DPRA. 2 AF Det 1 will
      provide reclassification instructions. AFPC/DPAAS2 will provide assignment
      information.
      A20.6.10.3. When training is conducted in a TDY en route status, the servicing MPS, in
      coordination with the TD, initiates the message required by AFI 36-2110 and sends
      information copies to 2 AF Det 1, AFPC/DPAAS2 MAJCOM/DPPA or MPRA, gaining
      and losing MPSs. 2 AF Det 1 will provide reclassification instructions to the losing MPS,
      with information copies to the TDY MPS and gaining MPS. AFPC/DPAAS2 will provide
      assignment instructions to the following:
      A20.6.10.4. When an active duty student is eliminated from Phase II training and
      discharge is recommended, normal AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen,
      procedures apply, in addition to the following:
      A20.6.10.5. For airmen at their permanent end-assignment, the TD will initiate the
      paperwork to advise the unit commander that discharge is recommended. The unit
      commander will then contact the appropriate training wing (TRW) registrar to determine
      if any information exists which would sup-port retention or have a bearing on the
      proposed discharge processing. If the Airman‘s commander concurs, a discharge case
      will be initiated by that organization.
      A20.6.10.6. For an Airman at a TDY en route base, the commander of the unit to which
      the Airman is attached will be advised by the TD that discharge is recommended. The
      commander will then contact the appropriate TRW training wing registrar to determine if
      any information exists that would support retention or have bearing on the proposed
      discharge processing. Providing no such information exists, the commander will contact
      the appropriate the servicing MPS to initiate a request for PCS to the en route base for the
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                             205


      purpose of discharge processing. Requests for PCS of eliminees to an AETC base will be
      addressed to AFPC/DPAAS2.
      A20.6.10.7. For recruits or initial skill trainees, separation may be initiated for failure to
      make satisfactory progress in the required training program (see AFI 36-3208).
      A20.6.10.8. If discharge processing results in retention, see applicable information in
      AFI 36-3208.
      A20.6.10.9. Should circumstances occur during TDY en route Phase II training that raise
      quality control questions that are not training related, the servicing MPS at the TDY
      location will dispatch a message to AFPC/DPAP with an information copy to
      AFPC/DPAAS2 for assignment determination.
      A20.6.10.10. Local conditions may occasionally require a change in the weapon system
      shred (and corresponding Phase II course). If TD training capability exists, the MPS can
      submit the formal request to AFPC/DPAAS2 with information copies to the 982 TRG,
      HQ AETC/A3T, and the MAJCOM. Upon AFPC/DPAAS2 message approval, document
      the AFSC shred change.
A20.7. Student Pipeline Flow. See responsibilities for HQ AETC/A3T and 982 TRG.
A20.8. Training Support:
   A20.8.1. Training Deficiencies. Should an STS training deficiency occur (or graduation date
   extend in excess of one week due to remedial training in Phase II), the unit conducting the
   training will report the deficiency according to AETCI 36-2203.
   A20.8.2. Support for Command Lacking Specific Training Capabilities. Some MAJCOMs
   may not have TD capability to support weapon system TOT due to small numbers of
   command gains. Gains to such commands will be trained at bases having TOT capability, as
   coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM, and scheduled by 982 TRG.
   A20.8.3. Alternate Training Methods:
      A20.8.3.1. Key to the TOT concept is the availability of operational equipment for TOT
      purposes. The host will ensure that aircraft and support equipment are provided. These
      arrangements will be closely coordinated between the TD and the host maintenance
      organization.
      A20.8.3.2. Alternate training methods to accommodate temporary surges or non-
      availability to training support equipment are vital to the success of multiphase training.
      Rather than develop alternate training courses to support such situations, existing courses
      will be used with STS tasks taught to lower proficiency levels. In each instance, a
      training deficiency report is required as out-lined in A4.8.1 above. When students are
      taught to proficiency levels lower than required by the STS, diplomas may still be
      provided.
A20.9. Student Scheduling:
   A20.9.1. Students whose Phase II training will be done at a TDY en route base will normally
   be held at the resident wing. Ordinary leave will not normally be granted. Exceptions to this
   policy will be at the discretion of the training squadron commander after coordination with
   373 TRS/TXFR and 82 MSS/DPMAA. In any case, students will report to the TDY en route
 206                                            AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   base no earlier than 14 calendar days and no later than 4 calendar days before TD class start
   date.
   A20.9.2. Students whose Phase II training will be accomplished at their base of end
   assignment should be scheduled to report to their gaining unit of assignment no earlier than
   30 calendar days, and no later than 4 calendar days before Phase II TD class start date. End
   assignment active duty students may complete the INTRO program, First Term Airman
   Center (FTAC), and all in-processing before the TD class start date if possible, provided it
   does not interfere with scheduled TD training. Students will not be removed from Phase II
   classes to attend in-processing or base INTRO programs or FTAC. NOTE: The INTRO
   program does not apply to ARC personnel.
   A20.9.3. TDs will promptly notify the following offices of no-shows.
       A20.9.3.1. TDY En Route Students. Notify 373 TRS/TXFR, AFPC/DPAAS2, losing and
       gaining MPSs.
       A20.9.3.2. End Assignment Students. Notify 373 TRS/TXFR, AFPC/DPAAS2, local
       unit commander and MPS.
A20.10. Operational Procedures:
   A20.10.1. The Initial Skill AFSC Multiphase Training Program for aircraft maintenance
   personnel is an alternative approach to training that developed during a period of constrained
   resources.
   A20.10.2. The ISD process will be used to determine the mix of training divided between
   phases of instruction and to develop and manage resulting training programs.
   A20.10.3. Total instructor and student authorizations (resident, TD, and task oriented
   training (TOT) augmentees) must be identified annually to support multiphase training. As
   training needs change, requests for adjustment of resources should be submitted through
   proper manpower channels. If an out-of-cycle request is submitted, the using command or
   agency will be asked to provide manpower until resources can be programmed and budgeted
   through the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution system.
   A20.10.4. Selective by-pass of Phase I may be authorized for the ARC prior service
   personnel based upon standards established by the National Guard Bureau (NBG) and HQ
   AFRC. Requests for waiver of Phase I training for active duty retrainees will be sent through
   the MAJCOM functional manager and the MAJCOM DPAT to AFPC/DPSFM for action
   with information copy to AETC/A3T.
   A20.10.5. Phase II for ARC personnel may be waived when specific weapon system and
   equipment required for TOT is expected to be unavailable. The ARC will develop and
   publish procedures that ensure personnel are given on-the-job training and upgraded to the 3-
   level within a stipulated time period after completing Phase I.
   A20.10.6. Specialty Training Standards (STS) will be used as the overall course content
   specification documents for multiphase AFSC awarding courses.
   A20.10.7. A relatively even flow of students between the phases of training is desirable to
   alleviate peak demands for equipment and instructors and to reduce pipeline inefficiencies
   and backlogs.
AFI36-2201_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          207


  A20.10.8. Students will report to the TDY en route base no earlier than 14 calendar days and
  no later than 1 calendar day before TD class start date.
  A20.10.9. Students should be scheduled to report to their gaining unit of assignment no
  earlier than 30 calendar days, and no later than 4 calendar days before Phase II training class
  start date. Students requiring Special Access Requirement (SAR) coding in support of
  classified weapon systems should report no later than 25 calendar days prior to detachment
  class start date in order to complete security requirements.
