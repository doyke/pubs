SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises 59 MDWI 41-102 by changing the Wing Compliance Committee to
the Commander’s Inspection Management Board. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised
material.
1. Program Policy. The Board of Directors (BOD) as the governing body sets policy and is
fully and legally responsible, either directly or by appropriate professional delegation, for the
 2                                                             59MDWI41-102 4 MARCH 2009


operation and performance of the organization, herein referred to as the 59th Medical Wing
(MDW) and WHASC. All references to “governing body” are by definition the 59 MDW BOD.
Chairpersons of wing-level committees are voting members of the BOD. They ensure their
wing-level committees are chartered and meetings have a purpose, agenda and set time limit.
Wing committees are responsible for activities identified within their charter and oversee
subcommittees and subordinate functions within their functional oversight. Subcommittees and
working groups are chartered at the discretion of the chairperson. Chairpersons brief the BOD
on outcomes. The charter is the only instrument used for establishing and managing committees.
Wing staff and group commanders are not to publish separate instructions or other implementing
plans for committees under their command or control.
2. Program Purpose. Wing committees formulate, implement and evaluate tactical level
objectives to promote a culture of safety and continuously provide high-quality health care
services in accordance with the principles of professional practice and ethical conduct. This
includes meeting compliance and regulatory standards, benchmarking and identifying innovative
approaches for operating a best-in-class, comprehensive and cost effective and efficient health
system that promotes and sustains the health, safety, performance and well being of both staff
and patients.
3. Program Responsibilities.
     3.1. Board of Directors (BOD). Sets policy, provides strategic direction, allocates resources
     and ensures the welfare and safety of staff and patients, and is responsible for the operation
     and performance of the organization.
     3.2. Wing-Level Committees. Implements and ensures a culture of safety, provides high-
     quality health care services, and maintains effective communication throughout the
     organization with linkage to quality management and improvement activities that support the
     mission and goals of the 59 MDW.
        3.2.1. Chairperson. A senior-level member of the BOD who “owns” (and therefore
        champions) the process, provides continuity of purpose and direction in meeting current
        and future mission needs. The chairperson removes barriers that would hinder the
        committee’s success. The chairperson:
            3.2.1.1. Provides management oversight.
            3.2.1.2. Selects a co-chairperson, team members and recorder.
            3.2.1.3. Provides resources needed for the committee to meet its charter
            responsibilities.
            3.2.1.4. Receives progress      reports   from   the   committee    and    subordinate
            committees/functions.
            3.2.1.5. Develops an agenda, using the format at attachment 2.
            3.2.1.6. Requires meeting minutes.
            3.2.1.7. Reviews, approves/disapproves minutes and annotates reason(s) for
            disapproval. 59 MDW Form 84, Review of Committee Minutes, is completed by the
            BOD Member assigned to review respective minutes. The reviewer briefs at the
59MDWI41-102 4 MARCH 2009                                                                                   3


             BOD and provides the completed form to the Recorder of the BOD for filing with the
             BOD minutes.
             3.2.1.8. Identifies all subordinate committees/functions reportable to the wing-level
             committee and a short summary of the mission/purpose of each subordinate
             committee/function.
             3.2.1.8.1. . Ensures communication between subordinate committees and the
             oversight wing-level committee on open actions items referred by subordinate
             committees with resolution back to the subordinate committee/function (see
             paragraph 3.2.7).
             3.2.1.9. Reviews and approves all minutes of subcommittees directly accountable to
             the appropriate wing-level committee by using the Minutes Review Summary at
             attachment 3. This function may be delegated to the wing-level committee
             membership.
          3.2.2. Develops a charter using the format at attachment 4.
             3.2.2.1. Charter. Represents a contract between leadership (in most cases the
             chairperson) and the committee. The mutually agreed upon charter clarifies
             expectations for the committee. The template is at attachment 4. Charters for group-
             level and sub-committees/working groups are not required.
                 3.2.2.1.1. Include subordinate subcommittees/functions, purpose and mission.
                 3.2.2.1.2. Submit final draft of wing-level charters to 59 MDW/EO for
                 processing.
          3.2.3. Committees with Subordinate Functions. Chairpersons may charter subordinate
          functions (e.g., subcommittees, working groups, etc.), determine membership, meeting
          frequency, documentation and subordinate functional requirements, and reporting
          procedures to the oversight committee. This includes implementation and evaluation of
          compliance with the Joint Commission (TJC), Health Services Inspections (HSI),
          Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI), Air Force
          Inspection Audit Agency (AFIAA) Audits, and other regulatory agency standards for
          which they are responsible.
          3.2.4. Function Reviews. Functions subordinate to a wing oversight committee briefs
          that committee on outcomes. Higher-level oversight committees and regulatory
          requirements determine the type and scope of data provided. The inputs from the
          subordinate functions may form the foundation for committee inputs to the oversight
          committee and the BOD.
          3.2.5. Committee Management. A meeting is often the best way to communicate
          information to others in a group when face-to-face interaction is necessary—when what
          you say depends on what another person says (or hears). Time spent attending a meeting;
          however, is time taken away from other duties. Table 3.1 provides guidance for an
          effective meeting.

Table 3.1. Running a Productive Meeting.
Purpose                          State why the meeting is being held and be clear about the objectives.
4                                                                        59MDWI41-102 4 MARCH 2009

Agenda                          Meetings should start with a well-planned agenda
                                List the topics in logical sequence
                                Prepare time allocation to each item on basis of importance, not urgency (for
                                  example, something is urgent, but not important, put it first but give it 5 minutes)
                                Have structure. Stop members jumping ahead or going over old ground
                                Achieve closure
                                Members should know what to expect before coming to the meeting.
                                It should contain sufficient detail to keep the meeting on track, but not to the point
                                  where members become slaves of the agenda
                                The agenda should not be the objective—it is a guide
Time                            Starting on time, staying on time and stopping on time are golden rules of meeting
                                  management.
                                Everyone’s time is valuable and it is likely that this is not the only meeting of the
                                  day for most members
Reaching Consensus              Setting and keeping reasonable time limits for activities can help the committee
                                  stay focused or reach closure on agenda items
                               Involve everyone in the discussion
                                Explore the alternatives
                                Listen to what the other person is saying
                                Identify actual problems, not symptoms
                                Be careful of quick, short-term solutions
                                Encourage differences to clarify issues
                                Avoid conflict-reducing techniques, such as majority vote, averaging or coin flips
                                Yield only to positions that have objective and sound foundations.
                                Try not to compete
                                Allocate time carefully
                                Always strive for the best answer
                                  1.      Good support data makes consensus easier
Tracking                        Show agenda items as “opened,” “tabled” (for future discussion), “info”, or “closed”. 

         roster matrix that is either attached or within the recording document.
         3.2.7. Minutes. Provide a clear, thorough record of oversight, decision-making and
         follow-up. Items requiring further action are tracked/followed to completion. Identify an
         effective mechanism for subordinate committees/functions to elevate issues to the
         appropriate wing-level committee with resolution back to the subordinate
         committee/function. Date the minutes the day they are distributed. Place information
         regarding future meetings in the last paragraph. If a committee member signs a
         document on behalf of the committee, the signature element indicates the member’s
         status on the committee. Show either: “open, ECD: (date) ________, POC: _______”,
         “closed” or “Info” status at the end of Old and New Business and other topics discussed.
         Indicate if BOD action is required on “Open” items. (Type “Approved as written” and
         “changes annotated” two lines below the recorder’s signature block, followed by the
         chairperson’s signature block.) Complete minutes within ten workdays following the
         meeting.
            3.2.7.1. Transfer action items between wing-level committees and/or sub-committees
            using the Transfer of Action Items between Committees memorandum at attachment
            5 and brief the gaining chairperson on the need for the referral. Committee minutes
            are to reflect the transfer action.
            3.2.7.2. BOD reviewers report results of committee minute reviews to the BOD
            during the month following the month in which the wing-level committee convened.
