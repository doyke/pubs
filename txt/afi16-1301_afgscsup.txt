  OVERVIEW
  Since the first publication of this instruction, several areas requiring increased clarification have
  been identified that impact the entire command. Updated locations are identified to complete or
  obtain copies of SERE 100 computer based training. Clarification of additional duties assigned to
  SERE specialists at unit level is provided to ensure mission accomplishment. The requirement
  for operating instructions signed at the Operations Group (OG) commander or equivalent level is
2                                               AFI 16-1301_AFGSCSUP 1 JANUARY 2010

spelled out and basic guidance provided on contents. The process to request additional
manpower authorizations to conduct code of conduct continuation training is clearly defined and
time limits placed on approved requests. OG commanders are delegated greater authority in
relation to identifying Emergency Parachute Training (EPT) SS-06 instructors. New guidance is
provided on currency requirements for EPT and non-interference flyers. This new guidance
allows OG commanders to designate increased currency requirements for those personnel that
have demonstrated proficiency, reducing training requirements. Guidance explaining the intent
of combat survival training is provided to ensure units understand objectives of the training and
methods to meet them. Information provided on Conduct After Capture (CAC) SS-03 brings
requirements in AFI 16-1301 and MDS specific Vol-1’s in line and reduces confusion. Combat
mission ready/ basic mission capable individuals are required to complete CAC every 36 months.
New guidance is provided to increase safety, requiring aircrew members to wear helmets and
gloves during emergency parachute training and personnel lowering device training.
Clarification on requirement for SERE specialists to have a Top Secret clearance and be
indoctrinated into Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI/SI-TK) is provided. Guidance
ensures SERE specialists are fully integrated into mission, evasion, and combat search and
rescue planning. Finally, additional clarification is given in Attachment 3, Operational Risk
Management. This guidance clarifies areas that need to be tailored to local environment and
training to increase safety.

should be accomplished prior to departure.
2.3.2.4.1. (Added) When base-level SERE specialists are deployed for more than 30 days,
leaving no SERE specialist capability at home station, those aircrew remaining at home station
are automatically granted a waiver for Combat Survival Training (CST), Water Survival
Training (WST), and Conduct After Capture (CAC) training events until the SERE specialist
returns. EPT will not be waived and must be completed on or before the due date by a certified
instructor. Aircrew must accomplish all waived training within 60 days of the SERE specialist
return to home station.
2.3.2.5. (Added) Due to the fact that there are no assigned SERE specialists within the missile
wings and AFDW, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) personnel or contractor equivalent are
authorized to provide CoCCT. They will comply with all certification requirements. Until they
are fully certified, the SERE FM assigned to HQ AFGSC/A3T will ensure that SERE specialists
are available and scheduled to complete all required CoCCT.
2.3.3.4. (Added) Personnel newly identified as requiring CST or WST, i.e., newly trained Flight
