4. Procedures in the event of disruption of UTA shuttle service.

    will complete both missions. This will either be accomplished by the mission capable
    aircraft completing a “Double Shuttle” (KMSP-KARR-KMSP-KMKE-KMSP) or a “Round
    Robin” (KMSP-KARR-KMKE-KMSP). The decision will be made by the Aircraft
    Commander and will be done in the most efficient manner without leaving any passengers
    behind. In the case of a “Double Shuttle” double TP’s are authorized for the aircrew.
    4.2. Members will be given liberal rescheduling authorization. Members can elect to have
    their UTA excused or conduct equivalent training.
    4.3. Members wishing to participate in the UTA may travel using GSA City Pair airfares. A
    credit card and military ID are required to purchase the airline ticket. Using an “YCA code,”
    when purchasing a airline ticket, may allow for a lower fare. Members are authorized to use
    the Government Travel Card to purchase tickets.
    4.4. Members may not be placed in manday or annual tour status for the travel day with the
    express purpose of covering their travel costs to Minneapolis. If members are placed on
934AWI10-204 29 JUNE 2009                                                                       7


   orders, the standing base policy (letter dated 24 Jan 2005) of at least one active duty day per
   IDT day will apply. Members must be scheduled for at least two annual tour days or
   mandays in addition to their two IDT days in order for travel reimbursement to be authorized.
