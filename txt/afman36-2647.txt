1. Scope.
   1.1. The vision for Institutional Competency (IC) development is to create the appropriate
   strategies, policies, and processes required to prepare all Airmen with the appropriate
   leadership expertise to accomplish assigned airpower missions.
   1.2. AF ICs apply to all Airmen across all functional communities and is the common
   taxonomy used to implement the Continuum of Learning (CoL).
2. Background.
   2.1. As part of the CoL framework, the AF develops ICs by providing synergistic education,
   training, and experiential opportunities that equip Airmen to meet the challenges of a
   dynamic operational environment. The ICs have replaced the Enduring Competencies and
   the Total Force Competency List.
   2.2. The Institutional Competency Development Programs (ICDPs) shall provide leadership
   knowledge and other attributes that allow Airmen to understand and possibly demonstrate the
   desired IC proficiencies. Actual attainment of ICs may be realized later or in conjunction
   with other education, training, or experiential opportunities.
   2.3. The ICDPs are officer and enlisted Professional Military Education (PME), the
   commissioning sources, Basic Military Training, and supervisory training (reference AFI 36-
   2301, Developmental Education).
   2.4. The ICs are the foundation for developing Professional Military Education (PME)
   programs as stated in AFI 36-2301.
   2.5. Assessing the potential of human capital measurement is a critical element of the Force
   Development (FD) process. Therefore, assessment data is instrumental in understanding how
   well the competencies are understood by Airmen and how they help leaders achieve FD
   goals.
   2.6. Competency assessment leads to more effective management of FD performance. The
   assessment effort consists of three phases: (1) identification of IC proficiency gaps from the
   military education schools, (2) identification of IC proficiency gaps from the military training
   venues, and (3) a holistic effort to examine how training, education, and experience
   contribute to enhancing competency for the Total Force (TF). The assessment process is
   discussed in more detail in Paragraph 6.
3. Purpose.
   3.1. Purposes of the ICs are to enhance leadership performance, set behavioral standards of
   leadership for all levels of the TF, and translate requirements and values into behavioral
   indicators.
   3.2. As Airmen progress in their careers, they should focus on increasing their proficiency in
   each of the required ICs via education and training opportunities, as well as deployments and
   assignments for themselves and development of those they lead or supervise.
4. Framework.
   4.1. The ICs consist of 8 competencies and 25 sub-competencies. Competencies are
   observable, measurable patterns of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and other
4                                                           AFMAN36-2647 25 MARCH 2014


    characteristics needed to perform institutional or occupational functions successfully. Like
    the AF Core Values, the ICs are enduring and encompass the leadership attributes the AF
    believes are critical to mission success.
    4.2. Competencies are delivered through the CoL that represents a combination of education,
    training, and experience for preparing Airmen for progressively higher levels of
    responsibility.
    4.3. The competencies are divided into three categories and these categories are linked to the
    AF leadership levels as explained in AFDD 1-1, Leadership and Force Development.
       4.3.1. Organizational category of the ICs (Employing Military Capabilities, Enterprise
       Perspective, Managing Organizations and Resources, and Strategic Thinking) is linked to
       the Strategic Vision Leadership Level and establishes policy and structure and articulates
       the vision for the organization.
       4.3.2. People/Team category of the ICs (Leading People and Fostering Collaborative
       Relationships) is linked to the Operational Competence Leadership Level and set the
       organizational climate.
       4.3.3. Personal category of the ICs (Embodies Airman Culture and Communicating) is
       linked to the Tactical Expertise Leadership Level and consists of those competencies
       needed in face-to-face and interpersonal relationships that directly influence human
       behavior and values.
    4.4. Airmen will require varying degrees of proficiency in each of the sub-competencies.
    The proficiency levels are measurable with action-type behavioral statements.
       4.4.1. The proficiency levels describe the full range of work performed within a
       competency--from gaining understanding through expert application.
       4.4.2. Proficiency level definitions and descriptive behaviors for the ICs are contained in
       Attachment 2.
    4.5. Developmental efforts are synchronized across the CoL providing the appropriate IC at
    the right time to maximize each member’s capabilities and their collective contributions to
    the mission.
       4.5.1. These competencies are universal requirements with an enterprise perspective and
       are used to drive total force development.
       4.5.2. Members will acquire desired ICs via education, training, and experience as stated
       in the CoL.
    4.6. Developmental venues throughout the AF will utilize the ICs in designing, executing,
    and evaluating developmental programs.
       4.6.1. Individual Airman developmental planning should be addressed in terms of these
       competencies.
       4.6.2. Assessments are required to identify leadership gaps between actual and desired
       mastery of the ICs. Methodologically sound assessment instruments are used to gather
       IC proficiency data for isolating strengths and areas for enhancement.
AFMAN36-2647 25 MARCH 2014                                                                     5


      4.6.3. The ICs and their use are addressed in AFDD 1-1; AFPD 36-26, Total Force
      Development; AFI 36-2014, Commissioning Education Program; AFI 36-2301; and AFI
      36-2640, Executing Total Force Development.
   4.7. As the Office of Primary Responsibility for the ICs, AF/A1DI, Force Development
   Integration Division, ensures the IC list and its components continue to meet AF
   requirements. For additional information on IC development, please reference AFI 36-2301.
      4.7.1. If a Functional Authority identifies a skill or ability not addressed by the IC List
      that is required of all Airmen, recommendations for change should be submitted to
      AF/A1DI for review.
      4.7.2. Recommendations are vetted through AF/A1 for consideration.
5. Assessment Strategy Scope.
   5.1. Assessments are used to identify and close gaps in Airmen’s capabilities.
      5.1.1. Individual leadership strengths are identified with recommendations for improving
      areas that need further refinement. The TF will have an opportunity to complete the
      individual assessments and use online resources to close gaps (reference Para 6.2).
      5.1.2. The organizational assessments are administered by the ICDPs.
   5.2. Some of the benefits of the assessment process include: (1) serving as a catalyst for
   creating a high performance workforce that will increase productivity; (2) identifying gaps
   that could exist in the execution of the competencies, allowing opportunity for improvement;
   (3) ensuring competencies are delivered as designed by the descriptive behaviors at the
   appropriate levels; (4) providing a foundation for the creation of targeted developmental
   plans; (5) improving outcome results of the process; and (6) maximizing return on
   investment.
6. Competency Assessment Process.
   6.1. Individual and organizational assessment of the ICs is a necessary component of
   competency-based management because it identifies an Airman’s proficiency level based on
   specific criteria and is demonstrated and sustained over time.
   6.2. Individual IC assessment instruments for the TF will help to identify leadership
   strengths and areas for improvement. They are 180-degree feedback assessments.
      6.2.1. The 180-degree feedback assessments are web-based surveys that gather
      observational information about performance using self and supervisor evaluations.
      These assessments will assist Airmen and their supervisors in identifying ICs for
      development and serve as an aid in designing a focused development plan.
      6.2.2. Descriptive behavior proficiencies are used to construct the tactical, operational,
      and strategic survey instruments. Airmen will select the appropriate assessment based on
      where they are in their careers.
      6.2.3. These 180-degree feedback assessments are offered at the Tactical Leadership
      Level for E1-E4, O1-O2, & GS1-8; at the Operational Competence Leadership Level for
      E5-E7, O3-O4, and GS9-13;, and at the Strategic Vision Leadership Level at E8-E9, O5-
6                                                          AFMAN36-2647 25 MARCH 2014


       O6, and GS14-15. They are located on the AF Portal under Life & Career/Force
       Development/Supervisor Resource Center

       934012F939C799305F8
       6.2.4. The web-based generated reports provide individual Airmen references to
       education and training resources for closing competency gaps.
       6.2.5. The Supervisor Resource Center at
       https://www.my.af.mil/gcssaf/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s88B4F00B2F6B2
       934012F939C799305F8 provides a clearinghouse of leadership development resources.
       The center features learning programs and courses based on the ICs.
    6.3. The organizational assessments are developed and administered by the ICDPs and an
    Executive Summary will be provided to AF/A1D depicting IC proficiency gaps.
       6.3.1. AFI 36-2301 provides additional information about the review and validation
       process for PME curricula.
       6.3.2. The curricula at the ICDPs are mapped to the ICs at the prescribed proficiency
       levels (reference Table A2.3).
    6.4. Components in the IC assessment process consist of identification of a sound
    assessment methodology; development of assessment survey instruments; assessment
    validation; web-based tool implementation; data collection, storage, and processing;
    reporting; analysis; and improvement. These components are needed to streamline the
    administrative elements of competency assessment.
    6.5. 180-degree feedback assessment surveys are administered using a web-based system to
    administer, collect, process, and store the data and generate reports to Airmen and their
    supervisors. Reports will direct Airmen to online resources for improving their IC
    performance.
    6.6. Feedback is a critical component of the assessment strategy. It provides information to
    Airmen on their competencies and helps them to define career developmental goals and a
    path to achieving those goals.

recruitment and retention efforts.
Experience—Active participation or involvement in positions, events, or activities leading to the
accumulation of knowledge or skill that can be utilized to meet mission requirements.
Force Development (FD)—A deliberate process of preparing Airmen through the CoL with the
required competencies to meet the challenges of current and future operating environments.
Institutional development generally results in leadership, management,
and warrior ethos proficiency. Occupational development generally results in flying and
technical skill proficiency.
Functional Authority (FA)—Senior leadership to include Assistant Secretaries (Presidential
Appointees confirmed by the Senate), Deputy Chiefs of Staff (three-star), and other selected
HAF two-letter General Officer or SES-level leaders that provide corporate perspective of
institutional requirements and force management and development. The FA serves as a final
authority to ensure all policies, established in accordance with this document, are implemented
within their functional community. FAs are supported by Functional Managers who are
supported by Career Field Managers.
Human Capital Measurement—Evaluation of how well a competency that drives productive
labor within an organization's workforce is performing. It captures behavioral measures against
job specifications.
Institutional Competencies (ICs)—Common taxonomy used to implement the CoL. These
leadership competencies are expected of all Airmen, throughout their careers, and will be the
competencies needed to operate successfully in the constantly changing environment in which
they function. The three categories of these competencies (Organizational, People/Team, and
Personal) are mapped to the AF leadership levels.
Institutional Competency Developmental Programs (ICDPs)—ICDPs are military education
and training schools and facilities that deliver the ICs to Airmen.
Organizational ICs—Apply to conceptual competence in creating policy, vision, and
interpersonal skills emphasizing consensus building and influencing peers and other policy
makers. Primary focus is at the Strategic Vision Leadership Level.
People/Team ICs—Combination of interpersonal and team relationships that are essential as
Airmen’s responsibilities are increased. Primary focus is at the Operational Competency
Leadership Level.
Personal ICs—Essential for individual contribution, for building cohesive units, and for
empowering immediate subordinates. Primary focus is at the Tactical Expertise Leadership
Level.
Records Disposition Schedule—Document providing mandatory instruction for the lifecycle
management of records (and non-record materials) in any format or media type. The RDS
provides for the disposition of records when agency business need for the records ceases, i.e.,
destruction of temporary records and transfer of permanent records to the National Archives of
the United States.
Taxonomy—Classification, categorization, or grouping of similar competencies.

Table A2.1. Proficiency Level Definitions.
  Basic – Airmen are focused on learning and developing a foundation skill set. They face similar challenges and have
  limited responsibilities and are given narrowly focused tasks.
  Intermediate – Airmen continue to learn and develop professional skills, understand how to leverage other professionals
  and knowledge sources, and begin to apply knowledge of the assigned objectives to their work.
  Proficient – Airmen leverage knowledge of issues and objectives to design and develop solutions. They understand how
  actions taken in one area of competence impact other related areas, and establish and manage the scope and quality of
  those areas of an assignment for which they are responsible. They may manage complex organizations.

  Skilled – Airmen leverage knowledge of strategies and issues to develop, present, and implement solutions. They consult
  with other subject matter experts and have a deep understanding how actions taken in one area of competence impact other
  related areas within proposed solutions. They contribute to the development of new levels of capabilities by articulating the
  added value of proposed solutions to leadership and staff and are considered subject matter experts within their
  organizational area. In addition, they may manage large, complex multi-tiered organizations.

  Advanced – Airmen impact the organization and the Air Force by leveraging their knowledge and expertise across the
  theatre to identify and address the critical success factors for complex areas. They apply knowledge of the strategic
  alignment of solutions with Air Force mission objectives and serve as recognized subject matter experts and thought
  leaders inside and outside their own organizations and/or represent the Air Force externally. In addition, they may manage
  large, complex multi-tiered organizations.
