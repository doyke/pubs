2.6. Management of Assignment Limitation Code C IDMTs.
   2.6.1. The Medical Evaluation Board/Physical Examination Board (MEB/PEB) process is not
   designed to decide if a person is fit to practice, it is a tool for deciding whether an individual’s medical
   condition limits their assignment/deployment options.
   2.6.2. The PEB sets a disability rating for the medical condition. Some medical conditions can pro-
   duce a significant level of disability that markedly interferes with functional ability. If the individual
   is not qualified to hold the AFSC, withdrawal actions according to AFI 36-2101 will apply.

                                  CLINICAL SERVICES SUPPORT

3.1. Medical Treatment.
     3.1.1. IDMTs perform all medical and dental treatment using AFMAN 44-158. These protocols, in
     conjunction with part II of the 4N0X1 CFETP, define the scope of practice for IDMTs. Physician pre-
     ceptors/on-call physicians and dental preceptors may, on a case-by-case basis, approve deviation from
     the prescribed USAF IDMT Medical and Dental Treatment Protocols. In this case, the provider and
     IDMT must document the deviation on their respective SF 600 and both SF 600s will be placed in the
     patient’s medical record.
        3.1.1.1. Patients with chronic problems are referred to a physician or dentist as appropriate. Med-
        ical or Dental preceptors give IDMTs written instructions defining their involvement in caring for
        patients with these conditions.
     3.1.2. Telemedicine Technology Use by IDMTs. With Theater/MAJCOM SG approval and in coor-
     dination with the designated physician preceptor, IDMTs may use telemedicine technology when
     available.

3.2. Medical Communication. The IDMT must immediately contact the HMTF physician preceptor or
on-call physician, when in doubt about a diagnosis/treatment, when dispensing any medication coded MD
on the IDMT authorized drug list or when protocols require.

3.3. Minor Surgical Procedures. The IDMT’s scope of practice is limited to suturing minor wounds
and opening/draining small abscesses. The IDMT may not suture lacerations crossing a vermilion border,
the eyelid, cartilage such as the ear or nose, openings over joint spaces that involve tendons or where deep
muscle is exposed, the genital or anal region, and the palms of hands or soles of feet unless directed by
preceptor. In cases where not re-approximating a wound may be detrimental to the patient, the IDMT
must consult the physician preceptor. Before performing any minor surgical procedure the IDMT must
obtain the patient's consent on OF 522, Request for Administration of Anesthesia and for Performance of
Operations and Other Procedures.

3.4. Medications. AFMAN 44-158 contains the IDMT Authorized Drug List and the scope of services to
be offered by each remote/deployed site or MMU, the MTF/HMTF Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T)
Committee/function determines the appropriate medication authorization. MTFs/HMTFs may make the
list more restrictive than the USAF IDMT Authorized Drug List.
     3.4.1. Additions/Substitutions to AF IDMT Authorized Drug List. The MTF/HMTF SGH forwards
     any recommended additions/substitutions to the USAF IDMT Authorized Drug List to the MAJCOM
     SG for review and approval.
     3.4.2. The IDMT dispenses medications as authorized by the MTF/HMTF, MAJCOM, USAF, and
     Department of Defense/Health Affairs directives.
        3.4.2.1. The JCAHO requires that all medications dispensed by non-pharmacy staff must follow
        the same procedures as if the drugs were dispensed by the pharmacy.
AFI44-103_ACC_I 5 AUGUST 2006                                                                          19


         3.4.2.1.1. The IDMT may only dispense controlled substances under the direction of a physi-
         cian. Specific physician instructions will be documented in the health care record and entered
         into the electronic patient profile [Composite Healthcare System (CHCS)] if available.
         3.4.2.1.2. The patient must countersign the prescription, acknowledging receipt of the con-
         trolled substance and understanding of instructions provided.
         3.4.2.1.3. Containers for all medications must be appropriately labeled with the patient name,
         name of provider, date issued, directions for use, quantity dispensed, and also must include
         appropriate cautionary labels to ensure safe, effective use of the medication by the patient.
         3.4.2.1.4. Documentation of patient counseling about proper utilization, storage, possible side
         effects, adverse effects, warnings, precautions, and interactions must be included either in the
         medical record or annotated on the AF IMT 781, Multiple Item Prescription. If patients
         decline counseling, the IDMT must document that fact in the patient medical record or on the
         AF IMT 781.
         3.4.2.1.5. IDMTs may dispense appropriately labeled and approved over-the-counter (OTC)
         medications IAW paragraph 3.4.2.
     3.4.2.2. IDMTs assigned to MMUs dispense medication at deployed or MAJCOM approved loca-
     tions and in the HMTF during pharmacy sustainment training.
  3.4.3. Dispensing Controlled Substances.
     3.4.3.1. Normally, IDMTs at remote/deployed/contingency locations will dispense controlled
     substances under the direction of a physician or dentist. The patient’s specific instructions will be
     documented in the health care record and entered into the electronic patient profile (CHCS) if
     available. The patient must countersign the prescription, acknowledge receipt of the controlled
     substance, and understanding of instructions provided.
         3.4.3.1.1. In the event there is a medically valid reason to dispense a controlled substance
         IAW the IDMT protocols, but the physician/dental preceptor cannot be contacted due to lack
         of communication connectivity at remote/deployed/contingency locations and the IDMT is
         unable to contact a USAF MTF ER (see para 1.10.11), the IDMT will dispense a 24-hour sup-
         ply of the controlled substance, document the communication failure and number of attempts
         to contact the physician/dental preceptor or ER.
         3.4.3.1.2. The IDMT will continue to call the preceptor/ER until able to contact and inform
         him/her of the situation and actions taken. The preceptor will document the incident and
         inform the SGH using AF Fm 765 Medical Treatment Facility Incident Statement.
  3.4.4. Labeling prescriptions. Prescription containers for all dispensed medications must be appropri-
  ately labeled IAW federal requirements stated in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Sections 502 and

        ing “CAUTION: Federal Law Prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person other than the
        patient for whom it was prescribed.”
        3.4.4.2. Appropriate auxiliary labels to ensure the safe and effective use of the medication.
     3.4.5. Documentation of Counseling. Documentation of patient counseling IAW the federal Omnibus
     Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. Patient counseling must include but is not limited to the
     following: name and description of the medication, route of administration, dose, dosage form, and
     duration of drug therapy. OBRA ’90 also mandates discussion of special directions and precautions
     for preparation of drugs, administration and use by the patient; common severe side effects or adverse
     effects or interactions and therapeutic contraindications that may be encountered (including their
     avoidance and the action required if they occur); techniques for self-monitoring drug therapy; proper
     storage; refill information; appropriate action in case of a missed dose and patient specific medication
     allergies.
        3.4.5.1. Documentation of such counseling must be entered on AF IMT 781, Multiple Item Pre-
        scription and on an SF Form 600 and placed in the patient’s medical record.
     3.4.6. Injection Therapy.
        3.4.6.1. IDMTs do not provide immunotherapy (allergy extract) unless they have completed the
        formal allergy course, have been awarded the 453 Special Experience Identifier (SEI), and are cur-
        rent in their training. Immunotherapy given by qualified IDMTS will only be done in the MTF/
        HMTF
        3.4.6.2. The IDMT may administer injections when directed by the physician preceptor/ on-call
        physician and in accordance with the AFMAN 44-158. EXCEPTION: IDMTs may administer
        epinephrine IAW the anaphylaxis protocol before consulting the physician preceptor.
        3.4.6.3. The IDMT may administer scheduled drug injections when directed by a physician or
        dentist.

inventory management. A list of approved medical supply items is signed by the MTF/HMTF Com-
mander or designee for the MMU/remote site and maintained by the IDMT. A copy is forwarded to the
HMTF Medical Logistics activity. Quantities on hand will not normally exceed a 30-day supply unless a
greater amount is the smallest quantity that can be ordered.
   6.1.1. Controlled Items. The IDMT uses the same storage, issue, accounting and inventory proce-
   dures and precautions for controlled drugs as a nursing unit, including AF IMTs 579. A separate form
   is used for each controlled drug.
       6.1.1.1. The MMU/remote site Commander appoints in writing a disinterested officer monthly
       (officer, SNCO E-7 or above, or civilian of comparable grade) to inventory Schedule II – V med-
       ications.
       6.1.1.2. The officer ensures that all drugs ordered from the pharmacy, as well as administered to
       patients, have been properly recorded since the last disinterested inventory reconciling each entry.
       6.1.1.3. The inventory officer counts the drugs on hand and verifies quantities by comparing
       stock on-hand to entries on each AF IMT 579 provided by the HMTF Medical Logistics activity
       or pharmacy.
       6.1.1.4. The inventory officer completes the Letter for Inventory of Controlled Substances,
       Attachment 5, by annotating the results of the inventory of each controlled substance and the bal-
       ance on the specific AF IMT 579. He/she includes a brief note stating “inventoried and found cor-
       rect” or “inventoried and found discrepancy of___” sign and date.
       6.1.1.4. (ACC) The MTF/HMTF Chief of Medical Staff (SGH) will designate licensed physician
       preceptors in writing.
       6.1.1.5. A copy of the inventory results is provided to the MMU/remote site Commander to be
       forwarded to the MTF/HMTF. The IDMT should retain the original for his/her records.
   6.1.2. Biennial (every two years) Review of Controlled Substances. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse
   Prevention and Control Act of 1970 requires an inventory of all controlled substances beginning 1
   May 1971 and every two years thereafter. The inventory officer/senior NCO designated by the MMU/
   remote site commander prepares a certificate to show the date of inventory, signature of the person
   conducting the inventory, and the site commander. Attach a copy of the inventory results to the certif-
   icate and forward the original to the HMTF Pharmacy and maintain current copy in the site folder.
