The Inspection Checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities,
and the AFI 90-201 USAFE Supplement 1, inspection programs. This guide identifies
compliance items that support guidance in the following: law, executive order, higher
headquarters publication (DoD, JCS, FAA, AFI, AFMAN, AFTO, etc.) and United States Air
Forces in Europe (USAFE) publications. This guide supports guidance in AFI 10-244,
Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces, as well as the associated USAFE
supplement. This guide is intended for inspections and Staff Assistance Visits. In addition,
higher headquarters inspection/assistance teams reserve the right to inspect, evaluate and assess
areas not listed on this checklist, however, as directed in JCS, Air Staff, and MAJCOM guidance.
It applies to all USAFE, measured units, Subordinate Reporting Organizations (SRO), as well as,
the individual measured units. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG)
and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and their units. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field
through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
pertain to the unit and ART reporting entities portion of the checklist.

1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
assessment. As a minimum, units should use these checklists in conjunction with their Unit Self-
Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required
capabilities. Higher headquarters may use this guide in whole or in part during visits or
exercises.
     1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items
     identified by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the HQ
     USAFE Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) to assess criticality of deficiencies.
        1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as
        key result areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to,
        items where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost,
        litigation or affect system reliability. These requirements may be mandated by law,
        Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs
        are referred to as significant guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs
        by using uppercase and bold letters.
        1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall
        performance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on
        mission performance but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation.
        Identify CGIs by using uppercase.
2. Applicability. All items on this guide are assigned an applicability code designating the
wing/unit/installation to which the item applies. GSUs are also subject to inspection using this
checklist.
