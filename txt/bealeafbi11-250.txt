2.1. RUNWAY INFORMATION. Runway 15/33, constructed of concrete, is 12,000’ long and
300’ wide; the runway is grooved 75’ either side of the centerline (center 150’ grooved). There
are 1,000’, nonload-bearing, asphalt overruns at each end. Note: the south overrun has an
additional 1,000’ of asphalt which is unusable due to raised approach lighting in the last 1,000’.
Runway elevation is 113’ MSL, measured at the Runway 15 approach end. Load-bearing and
surface specifications are available in the DoD IFR Supplement (see Attachment 2). Contact
Airfield Management (9 OSS/OSAA) for more information.
2.2. RUNWAY SUSPENSION AND CLOSURE.
   2.2.1. Runway Operations Suspended. Runway operations will be suspended when an
   aircraft is disabled on the runway, or when debris or other hazardous material might be left
   on the runway. The Tower Watch Supervisor, SOF and AMOPS personnel have the
   authority to suspend runway operations. Runway operations will normally be suspended
   immediately following IFE. Exception, if the SOF waives the FOD check, runway
   operations will not be suspended, see para 12.5.2.
   2.2.2. Runway Closure. The following personnel have the authority to close the runway: 9
   RW/CC, 9 RW/CV, 9 OG/CC, 9 OG/CD, SOF, and AM Ops. AM Ops is the only agency
   authorized to open the runway. AM Ops will advise the Tower when the runway is open.
2.3. PERMANENTLY CLOSED/UNUSABLE AREAS. Taxiway Alpha and the Christmas
Tree/alert apron are permanently closed. Request use of this area through the Airfield Manager
(AFM). Exception: U-2 Mobiles may use Taxiway Alpha for run-ins.
2.4. AIRFIELD INSPECTIONS AND CHECKS.
   2.4.1. Daily Airfield Inspection. The AFM or designated representative will conduct a
   minimum of one airfield inspection per day. The AFM will ensure personnel authorized to
   perform airfield inspections are knowledgeable and have an understanding of required
   distance for obstacles in relation to the runway, taxiways, and parking aprons.
   2.4.2. Quarterly Inspection. A joint airfield inspection will be conducted on a quarterly
   basis and should include representatives from AM, ATC, Wing Safety, SOF, Civil
   Engineering Squadron (CES), and Security Forces. The results of this inspection will be
   briefed at the Airfield Operations Board (AOB).
   2.4.3. Daily Opening Check. AM Ops will conduct a daily opening airfield check prior to
   any arrivals or departures to ensure the primary takeoff, landing, and taxi surfaces are FOD
   free, recommend the current bird watch condition, and assess the runway surface condition.
   2.4.4. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) Check. AM Ops shall conduct a runway check
   anytime the RSC is suspected to have changed and report conditions as follows:
       2.4.4.1. The runway shall be divided into four areas: North 3,000’, Middle 6,000’,
       South 3,000’, and Fringes (runway edge markings and beyond).

      2.4.4.2. AM Ops will call the runway either WET or DRY depending on the predominate
      condition of the runway, and may include additional information to include areas where
      the runway is patchy wet.
          2.4.4.2.1. If the runway is predominately WET it will be reported “Wet Runway”. If
          the runway is predominately WET, a NOTAM will be issued and it will be reported
          on the ATIS.
          2.4.4.2.2. If the runway is predominately DRY, it will be reported as one of the
          following:
             2.4.4.2.2.1. Dry runway.
             2.4.4.2.2.2. Dry (North 3,000’ patchy wet) (depth of standing water, if
             applicable).
             2.4.4.2.2.3. Dry (Middle 6,000’ patchy wet) (depth of standing water, if
             applicable).
             2.4.4.2.2.4. Dry (South 3,000’ patchy wet) (depth of standing water, if
             applicable).
             2.4.4.2.2.5. Dry (fringes patchy wet) (depth of standing water, if applicable).
             Note: “Patchy wet” information may be included for situational awareness and
             does not change the predominate RSC of DRY.
   2.4.5. Additional checks. AM Ops will check the runway when requested by the SOF or
   ATC and nightly to verify the status of airfield lighting.
   2.4.6. Emergency checks. AMOPS will normally check the runway immediately following
   any emergency landing. In the case of an airfield ground emergency, this check shall
   encompass all of the affected area. Unless a runway check has been specifically waived by
   the SOF, runway operations will be suspended after all In-Flight Emergencies (IFE) until
   resumed by AMOPS. AMOPS will log SOF runway check waivers on AF Form 3616, Daily
   Record of Facility Operation.
2.5. BIRD WATCH CONDITION. See               Beale    Plan   91-212,   Bird   Aircraft   Strike

3.1. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) SERVICES.
   3.1.1. Northern California TRACON (NCT). The FAA provides terminal Instrument
   Flight Rules (IFR) and Class C radar service to BAFB.
   3.1.2. BAFB Tower. Tower provides Class C service within a 5 Nautical Mile (NM) radius,
   surface to 2,100’ (MSL). Tower will coordinate with NCT to use airspace above 2,100’
   MSL.
3.2. CLASS C AIRSPACE.
   3.2.1. Coordination. NCT and BAFB Tower will coordinate sequencing and separation
   between IFR and VFR aircraft. Coordination procedures are contained in an ATC letter of
   agreement.
   3.2.2. Boundaries. BAFB Class C airspace is defined as follows; radials and distances are
   from the center of the runway (see Attachment 17), however airspace above 2,100’ MSL is
   delegated to NCT by Letter of Agreement. When Tower is closed, Beale’s airspace reverts
   to uncontrolled Class G below 700’ AGL and Class E at 700’ AGL and above.

3.5. LOCAL AIRCRAFT PRIORITIES. Local priorities do not take precedence over the
basic air traffic control priorities in FAAOJ 7110.65. After turn to final, an RQ-4 that loses all
command and control links is considered an Emergency and will autonomously land. Therefore,
during normal operations, an RQ-4 inside 7-mile final has priority over other aircraft conducting
training.

   3.6.1. Approval. ATC may disapprove or delay requests based on existing traffic or if there
   is insufficient lead time to coordinate with NCT.
   3.6.2. ATC Cutoffs. An opposite direction departure must be established on a course at least
   45-deg from runway heading before a normal direction arrival reaches a point 10 NM on
   final/initial. An opposite direction arrival must cross the landing threshold before a normal
   direction arrival reaches a point 10 NM on final/initial.
3.7. REDUCED SAME RUNWAY SEPARATION.
   3.7.1. The application of “dry” Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) will only be
   allowed when the Runway Surface Condition (RSC) is “dry” or “dry, patchy wet fringes”
   (see paragraph 2.4.4). ATC will use “wet” RSRS standards under all other RSC conditions
   (e.g. “Dry, patchy wet middle).
   3.7.2. Restrictions. RSRS may NOT be applied if any of the following conditions exists:
       3.7.2.1. An RQ-4, non-BAFB assigned, or Aero Club aircraft is involved.
       3.7.2.2. Any situation involving an emergency aircraft.

3.8. CIVIL AND TRANSIENT MILITARY PRACTICE APPROACHES. Civilian and
transient military practice approaches are authorized, to include use of the ILS. Practice
approaches during wing flying hours may be disapproved by the Tower Watch Supervisor or the
SOF if the practice will impair, delay or compromise the mission of 9 RW aircraft. All civil

aircraft practice approaches will terminate in low approach unless approved IAW paragraph
2.11.
3.9. RESTRICTED LOW APPROACHES
   3.9.1. Definition. A restricted low approach is a low approach at or above 700’ MSL (500’
   AGL). Restricted low altitude approach for heavy aircraft is at or above 1,200’ MSL (1,000’
   AGL) due to wake turbulence. RQ-4 aircraft shall not be issued restricted low approaches.
   3.9.2. Conditions. Normally ATC will issue restricted low approach when personnel or
   equipment are on or within 100’ of the runway or overrun edge. Unrestricted runway
   operations may continue with personnel and equipment up to the edge of the runway/overrun
   if all of the following conditions are met:
       3.9.2.1. Project manager has coordinated details of their activity with ATC and AM Ops.
       3.9.2.2. Ground crews maintain two-way communications with ATC.
       3.9.2.3. ATC issues an advisory to each aircraft.
       3.9.2.4. The pilot or SOF does not object.
3.10. RQ-4 OVERFLIGHT RESTRICTION. Aircraft under Beale tower control shall not be
permitted to overfly RQ-4 aircraft at any time. This procedure ensures separation in the event
the RQ-4 executes an unplanned/emergency climb. The RQ-4 will execute an immediate climb
to 7,000’ MSL if issued a go-around or if programmed logic determines the aircraft does not
meet set parameters.
3.11. AUTOMATED TERMINAL INFORMATION SERVICE (ATIS). ATC will operate
ATIS continuously during airfield hours.

                                 GROUND OPERATIONS

4.1. CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA.
   4.1.1. The designated Controlled Movement Area (CMA) is the runway, overruns, and any
   area within 100’ of the runway and overrun edge. Two-way radio communication and
   approval from ATC is required for access to the CMA, except for U-2 Mobiles and RQ-4
   Hawkeyes as specifically outlined in this instruction. All other areas are uncontrolled.
   4.1.2. Vehicles shall be operated IAW BAFBI 13-101.
4.2. HOLD LINES AND CRITICAL AREA PROTECTION.
   4.2.1. Instrument Hold Lines. Instrument hold lines protect NAVAID critical areas and are
   located on Taxiways B and E (see Attachment 2). A sign with “INST” in white letters on a
   red background is installed next to instrument hold lines.
      4.2.1.1. Instrument hold lines are in effect when the ceiling is less than 800’ AGL,
      visibility is less than 2 Statute Miles (SM), or ATC specifically instructs to hold at the
      instrument hold line. When the airfield rotating beacon is turned on, vehicles shall not
      proceed past the instrument hold line without ATC approval.
      4.2.1.2. Mobile/Hawkeye may proceed past the instrument hold line at any time.
   4.2.2. VFR Hold Lines. VFR hold lines protect the runway from vehicle/aircraft (see
   Attachment 2). Except for Mobile/Hawkeye procedures defined in this instruction, explicit
   ATC permission is required to cross a VFR hold line toward the runway.
   4.2.3. Precision Obstruction Free Zone (POFZ). The instrument hold lines are greater
   than 500’ from the runway centerline at the north end of the airfield and greater than 1000’
   from the runway centerline at the south end of the airfield. The POFZ is located inside these
   dimensions, and therefore no additional markings or signage is installed to identify/protect
   the POFZ.
4.3. TAXIWAY AND RAMP RESTRICTIONS. See Table 4.3 below for taxiway
restrictions. Also see AP/1. Refer to Beale AFB Plan 13-2, Aircraft Master Parking Plan for
more information; contact the Airfield Manager for a copy at DSN 368-9465.

                                                     Airfield Management
   4.3.1. Aircraft parking spots on the Recce Ramp are restricted to aircraft with wingspans of
   133' smaller. Exceptions must be coordinated with AM Ops at DSN 368-2002.
   4.3.2. Taxi lane G is restricted to U-2 or smaller wingspan when a C-5 is parked on spot C3.
   4.3.3. The Hawk Ramp is restricted to aircraft with wingspans of 133' or smaller.
   Exceptions may be approved by the Airfield Manager.
   4.3.4. Transient Ramp. The red carpet parking spot (DV1) is restricted to aircraft with a
   wingspan of 133’ or smaller and a turn radius of 65’ or less. Aircraft parked on the red
   carpet must use extreme caution and follow taxi line due to the proximity of hangar (bldg
   11200). The red carpet taxi line provides 25’ wingtip clearance from the hangar for a KC-
   135 aircraft. Aircraft commanders must ensure adequate clearance prior to operating in this
   area. All other transient spots are restricted to aircraft with wingspans of 60’ or less unless
   approved by AM Ops.
   4.3.5. Taxiing is not permitted in the Dock 1-6 area.
   4.3.6. B-52s must shut down on hammerheads and get towed to parking. Use caution for
   raised taxiway lights.
   4.3.7. Asphalt shoulders of taxiways and aprons are not stressed to support aircraft. Aircraft
   will not be taxied, towed, or parked on any asphalt surface or unpaved surface. Exception:
   (a) Aeroclub aircraft may be towed from the Skyhawk Ramp to the Aeroclub hangar by the
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                25


  most direct route, and (b) U-2 pogo wheels may roll over asphalt shoulders, however, avoid
  doing so if possible and avoid striking taxiway edge lights.
4.4. TAXI PROCEDURES.
  4.4.1. Aircraft shall state their location on the airfield when requesting taxi. Exception: T-
  38 and MC-12 aircraft will identify their location only if other than their respective ramps.
  4.4.2. All aircraft shall obtain taxi clearance prior to moving out of parking. If ATC
  observes an aircraft move out of parking without contact or coordination, hijack prevention
  procedures will be initiated.
  4.4.3. Portions of Taxiway Mike, Taxiway Hotel, and the transient/DV ramp are not visible
  from the Tower. Taxi with caution.
4.5. TOWING/MAINTENANCE TAXI PROCEDURES.
  4.5.1. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will coordinate all aircraft tows/maintenance
  taxis with ATC (during airfield hours) and Security Forces. Short tows to re-position parked
  aircraft in the same general area do not require ATC coordination. Exception: Aero Club
  coordinates tows/taxi with AM Ops according to Chapter 10 of this instruction.
  4.5.2. Prior to entering Taxiway F or exiting the restricted area, tow crews shall obtain
  Ground Control approval using aircraft radios or the Ramp Net, and shall monitor that
  frequency until off taxiways.
  4.5.3. Maintenance crews conducting taxi operations will contact ATC on ground control
  frequency and request taxi clearance. State the location, tail number and requested taxi route.
  Monitor ground control frequency and acknowledge and comply with ATC instructions.
4.6. ENGINE RUN PROCEDURES.
  4.6.1. MOC will coordinate all engine runs with ATC (during airfield hours) and SFS.
  Maintenance personnel shall obtain engine run clearance from Ground Control (during
  airfield hours), monitor Ground Control frequency, and advise when engine run is
  terminated.
  4.6.2. High-power engine runs must be conducted at designated locations. High-power tie-
  down anchors are located on the Cargo Ramp and Hawk Ramp. Idle power engine runs may
  be conducted on any parking spots except H1 – H14. AM Ops shall designate locations for
  transient aircraft engine runs.
  4.6.3. Engine runs are not authorized in the Dock 1-6 area. The Airfield Manager may
  authorize exceptions for propeller-driven aircraft.

   5.3.10. Aero Club/Helicopter Pattern. Pattern altitude 1,100’ MSL. West rectangular
   pattern; east pattern authorized when approved or directed by ATC (see Attachment 8).

   5.3.11. To allow air traffic planning and to preempt erroneous ATC release coordination,
   pilots should advise Ground Control as early as possible if they intend to delay in the
   VFR/IFR traffic pattern prior to departing on their delivered clearance.
5.4. GO-AROUND AND VFR PATTERN PROTECTION. To ensure appropriate separation
between departures, go-arounds, low approaches, touch-and-gos, missed approaches, and aircraft
in the SFO/overhead patterns, procedures in the following paragraphs apply to all aircraft unless
amended by ATC. ATC shall advise transient aircraft of appropriate pattern restrictions.
   5.4.1. VFR Pattern Protection. When the VFR pattern is in effect, all departing aircraft,
   except U-2s releasing pogos, RQ-4s, and MC-12s on initial departure shall maintain at or
   below 1,000’ MSL until departure end of the runway or ATC issued turnout, then climb out
   according to ATC clearance. When other pattern traffic is lower than 1,500’ MSL, ATC will
   amend the 1,000’ MSL restriction by issuing detailed climb-out instructions. When in VMC
   or VFR patterns are open, pilots executing missed approach shall maintain at or below 1,000’
   MSL until departure end of runway, then climb out as instructed.
   5.4.2. Offset Initial. To ensure 500’ of lateral separation between aircraft in the
   overhead/SFO pattern and U-2s releasing pogos, all RQ-4 departures, and MC-12 initial
   departures, ATC shall direct the airborne aircraft to offset initial left/right of the runway.
   The aircraft will offset no less than 500’, as required to keep the departing aircraft in sight,
   and break in the same direction as the offset, so as not to overfly the runway. ATC
   phraseology: “OFFSET INITIAL/HIGH KEY TO THE LEFT/RIGHT, U-2/RQ-4 ON THE
   RUNWAY FOR DEPARTURE.” Pilots will read back the offset instruction and add
   “OFFSET LEFT/RIGHT” to the Initial/High Key position report.
   5.4.3. Standard Go-Around. If ATC directs or the pilot initiates a go-around, the pilot
   shall fly runway heading, maintain at or below 1,000’ MSL until crossing the departure end
   of the runway, then climb out as instructed by approach control (or maintain VFR to stay
   with Tower). When pattern traffic below 1,500’ MSL is a factor, ATC will issue detailed go-
   around instructions in lieu of the standard 1,000-foot restriction.
   5.4.4. RQ-4 Go-Around. RQ-4 will immediately climb to 7,000’ MSL on course to the
   departure end of the runway, then turn east to the BAB 043/04 to enter a downwind leg.
   Unless otherwise directed by the controlling agency, the RQ-4 will descend to 4,000’ MSL
   en route to an 8 mile base leg where it will continue the descent to intercept final at 3,000’
   MSL and set up a glide path to touchdown. In the event of a catastrophic emergency prior to
   turning downwind, the aircraft will autonomously squawk 7700 and attempt to land in the
   opposite direction. After turning downwind, the aircraft will autonomously squawk 7700 and
   attempt to land on the active runway.
   5.4.5. Offset Go-Around. If ATC directs GO-AROUND LEFT/RIGHT SIDE, the pilot
   shall execute standard go-around (see paragraph 5.4.3) with a ground track offset 500’
   left/right of the runway. Pilots are responsible for determining the 500’ distance. The
   aircraft will turn closed/turn in the same direction as the offset, so as not to overfly the
   runway. Standard go- around climb restriction applies. RQ-4s will not be instructed to
   execute offset go-around.
   5.4.6. Local Climb Out. Defined as fly runway heading, climb and maintain 3,000’ MSL.
   When the VFR pattern is open, maintain at or below 1,000’ MSL until departure end. When
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                               29


   departing into the radar pattern, local pilots may be instructed to “EXECUTE LOCAL
   CLIMBOUT.”
5.5. HELICOPTER OPERATIONS.
   5.5.1. Beale AFB does not have helipads. ATC shall normally direct helicopter
   arrivals/departures to the runway, hammerheads, or intersections of Taxiway Foxtrot at Delta
   or Charlie.
   5.5.2. Helicopters shall not overfly other taxiing aircraft, flightline buildings, or parking
   ramps.
   5.5.3. Helicopters that are not capable of ground taxi will hover taxi along established
   (paved) taxi routes. Use caution to prevent rotor blast damage to equipment/personnel.
5.6. INTERSECTION DEPARTURES.
   5.6.1. Intersection departures are permitted from any taxiway upon request. Local
   operations that routinely use intersection departures will automatically be taxied to the
   appropriate intersection. Full length departures are available if desired.
   5.6.2. ATC shall issue distance remaining information to transient aircraft (see Attachment
   2).
5.7. CALL SIGNS. See table 5.8 below for 9 RW authorized call signs.

       Sleep Train Amphitheatre located between HWY 70 and 65.
       5.8.1.5. COWBOY – located at N3907.33 – W12128.70/BAB R227/2.5 DME
       5.8.1.6. PISTOL – located at N3909.08 – W12122.84/BAB R047/2.5 DME
   5.8.2. Arrivals via VFR entry points (other than MC-12 tactical arrivals) shall arrive at the
   entry point at or below 3,100’ MSL. All aircraft shall be considered requesting initial unless
   a straight-in approach or downwind entry is specifically requested prior to reaching the entry
   point
   5.8.3. MC-12s conducting the Bronco, Raven, or Crow tactical arrivals shall arrive at the
   entry point at 3,600’ MSL or 5,100’ MSL, but no higher than 500’ below the lowest stacked
   aircraft(e.g., if an aircraft is orbiting at 5,500’MSL, arriving aircraft must request

   5.8.4. Re-entry for initial/straight-in. Climb to overhead pattern altitude (U-2/MC-
   121,600’— T-38 2,100’) after the departure end of the RWY and proceed direct to the
   requested/directed point. Fly the normal VFR pattern ground track for re-entry. Report
   reaching the re-entry point. All aircraft shall be considered requesting initial unless a straight-
   in approach is specifically requested prior to reaching the re-entry point. Requesting a
   straight-in approach prior to reaching the reporting points will allow for proactive sequencing
   by air traffic control. Report reaching initial or five mile final for straight-in.

5.9. PAVE PAWS CAUTION. The PAVE PAWS phased array radar system, located east of
the airfield, is a potential hazard to airborne aircraft carrying electro-explosive devices (e.g.
ejection seats, flare dispensers). Aircraft carrying electro-explosive devices should avoid flight
within 1 NM horizontal and 6,000’ MSL above PAVE PAWS radar site located at N39.13°
W121.35° (BAB TACAN 072° radial, 4.2 DME).
5.10. ADF APPROACH.
   5.10.1. The Practice ADF approach (to AM 1410 located across from the Fairgrounds) is
   Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) only, minimum 5 SM visibility, and for 9 RW use
   only (see Attachment 18). Do not confuse this with the ILS RWY 14 (ADF procedure turn
   to Marysville/Yuba County airport).
   5.10.2. U-2s terminating the approach in a Simulated Flameout shall, on initial contact with
   ATC, state the intended High Key altitude and if runway crossing is required. Do not cross
   the runway centerline below 2,600’ MSL without ATC permission.
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                33

                                    U-2 OPERATIONS

6.1. U-2 DEPARTURE PROCEDURES.
  6.1.1. Intersection Departure. U-2s normally depart Runway 15 from Taxiway C and
  Runway 33 from Taxiway D.
  6.1.2. High Flight Release. Due to additional coordination between ATC, NCT and
  Oakland Center, U-2 high flights may experience some delay depending on traffic and ATC
  workload. To control flow and expedite ATC release coordination, departures should be
  ready for takeoff upon reaching the runway hold line. Pilots shall advise Ground Control as
  early as possible if they cannot accept an immediate IFR departure.
  6.1.3. Tactical Departure. Defined as a spiraling east turn, unrestricted climb to FL190
  remaining within 5 NM of BAB TACAN, then direct to PYNUN (SAC R345/90). Tactical
  Departures will not be filed in conjunction with a Departure Procedure. Tactical Departures
  will be accomplished in VMC only. Note: A spiraling climb to the west is unavailable due
  to radar coverage limitations.
     6.1.3.1. If initial climb to FL190 is unavailable, ATC will relay an amended climb
     altitude (determined by approach control). If unable to accept this altitude, the pilot
     should state intentions to depart non-tactical or delay until the unrestricted climb is
     available.
     6.1.3.2. Pilots shall write “Request Tactical Departure” in the remark section of the flight
     plan and should repeat the request to Beale Ground when calling for clearance (Example:
     “BEALE GROUND, PINON91, REQUEST IFR CLEARANCE TO (DESTINATION),
     TACTICAL DEPARTURE”). ATC will clearly state “TACTICAL DEPARTURE”
     when relaying IFR clearance to the pilot along with any modifications/restrictions prior to
     giving takeoff clearance.
     6.1.3.3. Upon reaching tactical climb altitude, pilot shall proceed direct to PYNUN and
     thereafter according to their IFR clearance.
6.2. U-2 SUPPORT (MOBILE/POGO) OPERATIONS
  6.2.1. Responsibility. The Mobile officer is responsible for all vehicle operations on the
  runway during launch, transition, and recovery operations. This includes accompanying
  maintenance “Pogo” crews as necessary.
  6.2.2. Communications. U-2 aircraft and Mobiles normally operate on ATC frequency
  287.0. Mobiles shall not perform ATC functions nor transmit ATC instructions or
  clearances, and will limit use of ATC frequencies to those transmissions necessary for safe
  U-2 operations.
     6.2.2.1. If Ultra High Frequency (UHF) equipped, Pogo crews shall monitor 287.0 to
     maintain situational awareness and to communicate with BAFB Tower if absolutely
     necessary to ensure safety.
34                                                   BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012


     6.2.2.2. Prior to operating on the runway, the Mobile officer shall perform a radio check
     with ATC.
     6.2.2.3. After runway operations are complete, the Mobile officer will ensure all
     accompanying vehicles and equipment are off the runway and shall advise ATC.
     6.2.2.4. Mobiles may change from ATC frequency in the interest of flight following or
     safety, as long as contact is maintained with the SOF.
  6.2.3. Departures. Mobiles and Pogo vehicles are automatically authorized onto the
  runway when their assigned aircraft is cleared onto the runway. Mobiles, Pogo vehicles and
  assigned aircraft are a departure package once on the runway, and are solely responsible for
  safely executing the departure procedures on the runway, including the separation of vehicle
  and aircraft during the procedures. Accordingly, the Mobile officer is authorized to
  maneuver as needed to accomplish all departure checks for the aircraft, until all vehicles and
  aircraft are off the runway. Mobiles shall ensure vehicles exit the runway at the same
  taxiway where they entered, unless ATC approves otherwise
  6.2.4. Arrivals. Mobiles are automatically authorized onto the runway to re-join the U-2
  when their aircraft crosses landing threshold. The Mobile officer and aircraft pilot are a
  recovery package once a landing clearance is issued by ATC, and are solely responsible for
  the separation of vehicle and aircraft during the rejoin/recovery procedure. Accordingly, the
  Mobile officer is authorized to maneuver as needed to accomplish a re-join with the
  recovering aircraft. Mobiles chasing aircraft conducting low approach/touch-and-go shall
  exit the runway via the most expeditious route without reversing course, except as defined in
  paragraph 6.2.4.1 below, or as directed by ATC.
     6.2.4.1. Course reversals to taxiways Charlie/Delta. The 6,000’ runway distance
     remaining marker shall be the determining factor in reversing course to Taxiway
     Charlie/Delta versus continuing to the next taxiway. Mobiles may reverse course and
     exit at taxiway Charlie/Delta prior to reaching the 6,000’ runway distance remaining
     marker without requesting permission from ATC. Once past the 6,000’ runway distance
     remaining marker, Mobiles shall proceed to the next taxiway and not reverse course
     without ATC approval, i.e., “REQUEST ONE- EIGHTY”.
     6.2.4.2. Pogo vehicles may enter the runway only after receiving ATC permission. The
     Pogo vehicle will enter the runway from the taxiway nearest to where the aircraft stopped
     (typically Charlie/Delta). When Mobiles are providing escort for Pogo vehicles, the
     Mobile officer must obtain permission from ATC.
     6.2.4.3. After recovery operations are complete, the Mobile officer is responsible for
     reporting to ATC when all recovery vehicles and aircraft are off the runway.
  6.2.5. Staging Areas and Run-In. When Runway 15 is active, Mobiles shall use Taxiway
  B for staging and run-ins to the runway. When Runway 33 is active, Mobiles shall use
  Taxiway E for staging and run-ins to the runway. High-keys at Delta and Charlie taxiways
  require Mobiles to stage at those taxiways.
  6.2.6. Support Priorities. In the event of a simultaneous recovery and departure, the Pogo
  crew will give priority to the departure unless the recovery is blocking the runway, or unless
  another priority is directed by the SOF.
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                35


6.3. EMERGENCY PROCEDURE (EP) PATTERNS. EP Patterns include Simulated
Flameout (SFO) patterns and “Flaps Up” patterns. All EP patterns require VMC conditions and
must be conducted between the start of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil
twilight.
   6.3.1. U-2 Simulated Flameout. Simulated Flameout (SFO) pattern training is critical to
   the pilots of the 9 RW. SFO pattern begins at High Key and ends 10’ above the runway
   normally followed by a landing or low approach. The pattern must be flown from start to
   finish to achieve the desired training objective. After leaving High Key, ATC will only issue
   pattern adjustments or discontinue the approach if required for flight safety. If necessary,
   SOF or ATC watch supervisor may disapprove SFO patterns.
      6.3.1.1. The SFO pattern requires all of the following conditions:
          6.3.1.1.1. Daytime (between start of morning civil twilight to the end of evening civil
          twilight).
          6.3.1.1.2. VFR weather conditions (1,500’ AGL ceiling and 3 SM visibility).
          6.3.1.1.3. Ceiling at least 500’ above High Key altitude.
          6.3.1.1.4. Flight or ground visibility of 3 SM or greater.
          6.3.1.1.5. ATC workload of less than eight aircraft.
          6.3.1.1.6. No more than 3 aircraft may be in an SFO pattern at one time.
      6.3.1.2. SFO Procedures. The pilot shall obtain ATC approval for a SFO. The request
      should include the desired High Key altitude. High Key altitude is 1,100’ to 2,100’ MSL.
          6.3.1.2.1. Phraseology: “(Call Sign), REQUEST (High Key Altitude) HIGH KEY.”
          6.3.1.2.2. When multiple aircraft are in the 2,100’ MSL patterns, ATC shall use
          offset procedures or other ATC techniques as needed to effectively separate aircraft.
          6.3.1.2.3. The pilot will report High Key, normally over the first two thirds of the
          runway. An abnormal or extended High Key (beyond first two thirds of the runway)
          requires prior coordination with ATC.
          6.3.1.2.4. Turns out of High Key will be to the east unless a west SFO pattern is
          approved or directed by ATC.
          6.3.1.2.5. Low Key altitude is normally 600’ to 1,100’ MSL near the approach end of
          the runway.
      6.3.1.3. High Key Abeam Charlie/Delta. A High Key, normally 1,100’ MSL, abeam
      Taxiway C (Rwy 33) or abeam Taxiway D (Rwy 15) shall turn out to the west. Remain
      within 3 NM of the runway throughout the turn. Pilots will specifically request “HIGH
      KEY ABEAM CHARLIE/DELTA.” Low Key will normally be between Charlie and
      Delta.
      6.3.1.4. Simulated Glide to High Key. Since an engine can flame out at any time, it is
      crucial for pilots to practice SFO patterns from various altitudes and geographical
      positions.
36                                                 BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012


        6.3.1.4.1. Pilots may practice SFO patterns from a requested altitude and
        geographical position with ATC approval. Example: “(Call Sign), REQUEST
        (Altitude), (East/West/North/South) OF THE FIELD.” Remain within 5 NM radius
        of BAFB unless otherwise approved by ATC.
        6.3.1.4.2. Pilots will report when inbound and request High Key. Example: “(Call
        Sign), INBOUND FOR HIGH KEY.” The ATC instruction to commence the SFO
        will be “REPORT HIGH KEY.” If multiple 360 degree turns to High Key are
        required, notify ATC and report “HIGH KEY” when commencing the last turn.
        6.3.1.4.3. Pilots will not cross the runway centerline without ATC approval.         If
        conditions dictate a change of ground track, request the change with ATC.
     6.3.1.5. SFO Alternate Entry Points. Pilots shall use Alternate Entry Procedures
     anytime a SFO commences at a point other than High Key (over the runway) and
     intercepts the normal SFO pattern prior to base key. A SFO glide that intercepts the
     normal SFO pattern at High Key is NOT an Alternate Entry.
        6.3.1.5.1. Two Alternate Entry points are located east of Runway 15/33 defined as 30
        degree arcs at 4 DME and one Alternate Entry point to the west defined as a 40
        degree arc at 4 DME (see Attachment 10). The SFO may begin from any point on
        the selected arc at an altitude from 1,100’ – 4,000’ MSL. Pilots shall proceed direct
        to Low Key. Do not cross runway centerline without ATC approval.
        6.3.1.5.2. Pilots shall request: “(Call Sign), REQUEST (Entry Point), at (Altitude).”
        Remain at or below 2,100’ MSL until cleared above. When inbound report “(Call
        Sign), (Entry Point), inbound for LOW KEY.” ATC may direct a 360 degree turn at
        the entry point for sequencing.
     6.3.1.6. Maneuvering Airspace. The following applies if ATC is unable to approve a
     high/alternate entry SFO request and the pilot elects to maneuver in Class C airspace,
     outside of the VFR pattern, until the SFO becomes available.
        6.3.1.6.1. Maneuvering airspace may be ATC directed or pilot requested and is
        intended to facilitate SFO entry at High Key/Alternate Entry point as soon as ATC
        approval is received. Pilot phraseology: “(Call Sign), REQUEST MANEUVERING
        AIRSPACE EAST/WEST OF THE AIRPORT/RUNWAY AT (Altitude).”
        6.3.1.6.2. East/west maneuvering airspace begins 2 miles from the runway centerline
        and extends to the boundary of the Class C surface area.
        6.3.1.6.3. If only a short delay is expected, and traffic permitting, ATC may instruct,
        “ORBIT HIGH KEY.” The pilot shall climb/descend to High Key altitude (or as
        instructed) and enter 360-degree turns carrying through High Key. Unless otherwise
        coordinated, turns shall be in the same direction that the SFO will be conducted.
     6.3.1.7. SFO Cutoffs. ATC personnel shall use the following cutoffs for separating and
     sequencing traffic when U-2 SFO patterns are being flown.
        6.3.1.7.1. Arrivals:
            6.3.1.7.1.1. U-2/MC-12 (or any transient CAT II or smaller aircraft) VFR or IFR,
            traffic shall not be allowed to proceed any closer than 4 miles on final until the
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 37


            SFO U-2 reports Low Key. A U-2 may be authorized to depart Low Key when a
            U-2/MC-12 is 1 mile or closer on final.
            6.3.1.7.1.2. T-38 (or any transient CAT III aircraft) VFR or IFR, traffic shall not
            be allowed to proceed any closer than 5 miles on final until the SFO U-2 reports
            Low Key. A U-2 may be authorized to depart Low Key when a T-38 is 2 miles or
            closer on final.
            6.3.1.7.1.3. An RQ-4/ heavy weight class aircraft VFR or IFR shall not be
            allowed to proceed any closer than 7 miles on final until the SFO U-2 reports Low
            Key.
            6.3.1.7.1.4. Aircraft conducting a Visual approach shall not be allowed closer
            than 4 miles to the runway with an aircraft between Low Key and Base Key.
            6.3.1.7.1.5. Aircraft conducting an overhead or rectangular pattern shall not be
            allowed to turn base with aircraft between Low Key and Base Key.
         6.3.1.7.2. Departures: Do not clear an aircraft onto the runway (takeoff or Line Up
         and Wait) after a U-2 reports Low Key. Note: an aircraft already on the runway prior
         to a U-2 reporting Low Key may be cleared for takeoff.
  6.3.2. U-2 No-Flap Pattern. U-2 No-Flap pattern can be flown from either a closed pattern
  or an overhead pattern.
     6.3.2.1. Pilots shall request extended pattern with ATC: “(Call sign) REQUEST
     CLOSED, EXTENDED PATTERN or “(Call sign) INITIAL, REQUEST EXTENDED
     BASE.” ATC shall respond with: “(Call sign), EXTENDED CLOSED TRAFFIC
     APPROVED.”
     6.3.2.2. U-2 extended pattern is a simulated emergency landing pattern normally flown
     to the east (west pattern authorized with ATC approval) at 1,100’ MSL until abeam the
     approach end, then begins a descent to turn extended base at 600’-800’ MSL and
     approximately 2-3 miles.
     6.3.2.3. Due to the reduced airspeed margin and shallow glide path for this pattern, ATC
     will only issue pattern adjustments or discontinue the pattern beyond the approach end of
     the runway if required for flight safety. If necessary to discontinue a no-flap pattern after
     passing the approach end of the runway, ATC will direct a climbing turn to reestablish on
     downwind at 1,100’ MSL prior to the approach end. 360-degree turns will not be
     accomplished on practice no-flap patterns after descending below downwind altitude.
     6.3.2.4. Pilots will not request an extended pattern if a no-flap, spoilers extended, 1 mile
     final is planned. Add “no-flap” to the base turn radio call to inform the Mobile.
6.4. U-2 STEREO ROUTES.
  6.4.1. IFR Routes. AM Ops maintains the following coded routes for 9 RW-assigned U-2
  aircrews departing IFR. Altitudes other than those listed may be requested from ATC or AM
  Ops.
     6.4.1.1. CHICO - Fly runway heading, radar vectors CIC D0+30, BAB. Requested
     altitude 10,000’ MSL.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     T-38 OPERATIONS

7.1. T-38 TACTICAL INITIAL.
   7.1.1. Approval. ATC must approve tactical initial prior to entering BAFB Class C airspace
   in tactical formation. Tactical initial will not be approved for formations of more than four
   aircraft or when an RQ-4, MC-12 initial departure, or U-2 releasing pogos has been cleared
   for takeoff. Aircraft established in the east patterns must be at or below 1,600’ MSL for a
   tactical initial to be approved. For coordination, pilots will inform SOF prior to departure or
   inbound to BAFB of intentions to request tactical initial.
   7.1.2. Procedure. A west overhead pattern will normally be flown; pattern altitude 2,100’
   MSL. Traffic permitting, flight leads may request east patterns and/or pattern altitude of
   1,600’ MSL (if east pattern aircraft are at or below 1,100’ MSL).
       7.1.2.1. 2-ship. Lead will align with the runway centerline on initial, wingman will
       space 4,000’ to 6,000’ abeam on the side opposite the break. Roll-out on downwind
       should be with in-trail formation spacing.
       7.1.2.2. 4-ship. A “box” formation will be flown, with the second 2-ship element no
       more than 6,000’ directly behind the first (or slightly offset on the side opposite the
       break). The lead element will break normally and the second element will break to roll
       out with 4-ship in-trail spacing on downwind.
7.2. TALON 1 PROCEDURES. Formations on initial that wish to complete individual touch-
and-go landings and then re-form for a straight-in and formation landing will add “TALON 1” to
the initial radio call to inform ATC. Example: “(Call Sign), INITIAL, TALON 1.” Note: The
Talon 1 procedure is intended for one touch-and-go landing immediately followed by a straight-
in full stop. Traffic permitting, ATC may approve multiple touch-and-go landings. Example for
such a request: “(Call sign), INITIAL, TALON 1, REQUEST THREE PATTERNS.”
   7.2.1. ATC will sequence the formation as a single unit. Pilots in the formation are
   responsible for aircraft separation between aircraft in the flight. If more than one pattern is
   requested, it may be difficult to sequence the formation as a single unit with other traffic.
   7.2.2. Make request for straight-in upon completion of final touch-and-go.
   7.2.3. Four-ship formations will rejoin for two, 2-ship wing landings. RSRS between flights
   will be 6,000’. If only one element is requesting to rejoin, call on initial will state which
   element is requesting the TALON 1. Example: “(Call sign), INITIAL, TALON 1, SECOND
   ELEMENT.”
   7.2.4. Any deviations from this procedure must be requested and approved by ATC.
7.3. T-38 FORMATION SPLIT-UP. Formations entering the pattern will clearly state
intentions with ATC (i.e., “TALON 1” or other approved procedure). Otherwise, formations will
be sequenced as separate aircraft following the first single-ship approach/landing. This
procedure maximizes single-ship aircrew training and ATC sequencing flexibility. ATC will
assume responsibility for separation between previous participating elements of a flight
 40                                                      BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012


following either: (1) the first single-ship touch and go landing after initial or (2) the lead aircraft
pulls closed following a formation low approach.
7.4. FORMATION CALL SIGN USAGE. Formations will use the formation call sign
regardless of aircraft position when the request/position report applies to all aircraft in the
formation. For example, “(Call Sign), INITIAL, TALON 1” or “(Call Sign), REQUEST FIVE-
MILE STRAIGHT-IN.” After split-up, aircraft previously in formation will use their
individually assigned call sign. Note: Gear Down Call - For accountability reasons, formation
members in the overhead traffic pattern or during formation “drag” procedures will call “gear
down” using its individually assigned call sign regardless of current position in the formation.
7.5. AIRSPACE SCHEDULING.
   7.5.1. Scheduling. Schedule MOA/ATCAA usage with 9 RW scheduling office as
   published in the DoD Area Planning guide (AP/1). If the time requested is outside the
   MOA/ATCAA’s published hours, scheduling will coordinate with the controlling agency to
   issue appropriate NOTAMs. Oakland Center is the controlling authority for MOA/ATCAA
   entry/exit and real-time activity status.
   7.5.2. Whitmore MOA/ATCAA. Altitudes normally 3,000’ AGL or 11,000’ MSL,

                                           Chapter 8

                                     RQ-4 OPERATIONS

8.1. CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORIZATION. Pilots will comply with each COA and LOA
in effect between Beale and other Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities. Currently, United States
Air Force Air Combat Command maintains a COA with the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) for RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft Operations. Additionally 9 OSS/OSA
(Airfield Operations) maintains a LOA specific to RQ-4 operations with Northern California
TRACON (NCT). The 9 OG/NCT, RQ-4 Coordination and Control Procedures LOA contains
specific routing instructions incorporated in RQ-4 mission plans.
8.2. AIRSPACE SCHEDULING. Normally China, Maxwell and Whitmore MOA/ATCAA
are used for local RQ-4 flights. Coordinate airspace reservations with 9 OSS/OSOH. The China
MOA/ATCC is the primary area for RQ-4 climbs, descents or holding for ATC sequencing. The
Maxwell MOA/ATCAA is the secondary area. All references to the China and Maxwell 1, 2,
and 3, and Whitmore 1, 2, and 3 MOAs in this section pertain to the lateral confines only,
altitude requirements will be as directed by ATC.
8.3. RQ-4 GROUND OPERATIONS.
   8.3.1. Engine Start. The RQ-4 mission initiates with maintenance towing the aircraft to a
   launch spot (mission start point). Limitations in the aircraft design preclude starting and
   taxiing from any location other than the surveyed launch spots. Engine start commences
   usually one hour before takeoff. The pilot, RQ-4 Mobile (call sign “Hawkeye”), and the
   crew performing the engine start will monitor ground frequency during engine start
   operations.
   8.3.2. ATC Release. Due to additional coordination between ATC, NCT, and ARTCC, RQ-
   4 departures may experience delays depending on air traffic and ATC workload. To control
   flow and expedite ATC release coordination, departures should be ready for takeoff upon
   reaching the runway hold line. Pilots shall advise ATC as early as possible if they cannot
   accept an immediate IFR departure.
   8.3.3. Designated Start Areas. There are two designated RQ-4 start points; Global Hawk
   South (GH-S) on the Hawk Ramp and Global Hawk Hammerhead (GH-HH) on the north
   hammerhead adjacent Taxiway Bravo.
8.4. RQ-4 DEPARTURES.
   8.4.1. Takeoff. Hawkeye will shadow the RQ-4 during takeoff to monitor for excess side-
   drift or aircraft problems. If a takeoff abort is required, Hawkeye or the LRE pilot will report
   over tower frequency “Abort, Abort, Abort”. The aircraft will rapidly decelerate to a stop and
   remain on the runway until a maintenance team arrives to tow the aircraft. There is no ability
   for the RQ-4 to taxi clear of the runway following a takeoff abort. It is possible for aircraft
   programming to reject a pilot-initiated abort and continue a takeoff, or execute an
   autonomous (non-commanded) abort if specific departure roll parameters are not met.
   CAUTION: Pilots and ATC will be aware that aircraft altitude, performance limitations, or
   steering point guidance may result in the RQ-4 executing an immediate return and landing
 44                                                   BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012


   opposite direction on the active runway. ATC shall ensure the runway remains clear until a
   departing RQ-4 reaches 7,000’ MSL.
   8.4.2. Departure. For normal departures, the RQ-4 proceeds to the China, Maxwell, or
   Whitmore MOA/ATCAA via the Global Hawk RPA departure ground track (see Northern
   California TRACON/Beale AFB 9th Operations Group Letter of Agreement). RQ-4
   operators will ensure the aircraft remains within radar coverage via confirmed Remote
   Alpha-Numeric Color Display (R-ACD) radar observation while operating below Class A
   airspace during climb out. RQ-4 launches may be suspended when the R-ACD is non-
   operational. NCT will be notified of any R-ACD outages.
8.5. RQ-4 ARRIVALS.
   8.5.1. Arrival. When applicable, the LRE will be manned at least 90 minutes prior to all
   scheduled RQ-4 arrivals. The 4.5° approach flown by the RQ-4 is preprogrammed and does
   not conform with standard instrument approaches In general, the RQ-4 proceeds from China
   or Maxwell MOA/ATCAAs at or above FL200, holding and or descending within the MOAs
   lateral confines as directed by air traffic control. Return routing follows a pre-programmed
   flight plan, terminating at the Initial Approach Point (IAP) of the Global Hawk Approach
   (see 9 OG/NCT, RQ-4 Coordination and Control Procedures LOA). Pilots will ensure the
   aircraft remains within Class A airspace until under confirmed R-ACD (or FAA-approved
   equivalent) radar observation for the descent phase. Notify NCT of any R-ACD outage and
   comply with instructions. Once inside the 7 mile final, ATC shall ensure the runway is clear
   for landing/low approach.
   8.5.2. Landing. The RQ-4 is programmed to land approximately 1,500’ past the runway
   threshold. Winds, fuel imbalances, or other factors may affect the exact touchdown point.
   Hawkeye will monitor landing progress and may, prior to touchdown, call for an aircraft “go-
   around” over tower frequency. Once the aircraft is below 200’ AGL, a go-around is no
   longer possible. Note: Some RQ-4 emergencies or abnormal conditions will require aircraft
   shut down on the active runway. Once the aircraft has come to a complete stop, maintenance
   crews will perform post-flight procedures and tow the aircraft off the runway.
   8.5.3. Go-Around. The RQ-4 go-around is a climb to 7,000’ MSL toward the departure end
   of the runway. In the event of an emergency requiring an immediate landing and time
   permitting, the pilot will advise ATC of the intended landing runway. Pilots and ATC will
   be aware that aircraft altitude, performance limitations, or steering point guidance may result
   in landing opposite direction on the active runway.
8.6. RQ-4 DIVERT PROCEDURES. Edwards AFB, CA. is the primary divert base for RQ-4.
Emergency engine-out divert locations are Fallon NAS, NV and Tonopah Test Range, NV. For
Fallon NAS, Fallon Approach Control will be the controlling agency for descent from Class A
airspace to landing. For Tonopah Test Range Base, Nellis Approach will be the controlling
agency for descent from Class A airspace to landing. Pilots will ensure Edwards AFB, Fallon
NAS, and Tonopah Test Range are notified of their respective vulnerability periods as
appropriate, for local RQ-4 flight operations.
8.7. PILOT/ATC Communications. Primary communications between the RQ-4 pilot and
ATC will be via sector-discrete radio frequencies, relayed through RQ-4 system equipment via
ground stations or aircraft. Secondary communications will be via Land Mobile Radio (LMR).
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   45


In the event of radio failure, the pilot will notify ATC via landline to initiate communications via
LMR.
8.8. RQ-4 MOBILE (HAWKEYE) OPERATIONS.
   8.8.1. Responsibility. Hawkeye is responsible to visually clear for the pilot-in-command
   during all ground operations from engine start through aircraft liftoff, and landing until the
   aircraft is off the runway and the engine is shut down. The Hawkeye is responsible for all
   vehicle operations on the runway during launch, and recovery operations. This includes
   accompanying maintenance crews as necessary.
   8.8.2. Communications. RQ-4 aircraft and Hawkeye normally operate on Ground Control
   and Tower frequencies. Hawkeye shall not perform ATC functions and will limit use of
   ATC frequencies to those transmissions necessary for safe RQ-4 operations.
       8.8.2.1. Hawkeye will perform a radio check with tower prior to operating on the
       runway. Hawkeye will report “off the runway” to tower once all accompanying vehicles
       and equipment are off the runway.
       8.8.2.2. Hawkeye may change from ATC frequency in the interest of flight following or
       safety, as long as contact is maintained with the SOF.
       8.8.2.3. If equipped, maintenance crews shall monitor ATC frequency to maintain
       situational awareness. Communicate with ATC only if necessary to ensure safety.
       Hawkeye shall be the primary focal point for Tower/Maintenance coordination.
       8.8.2.4. Prior to conducting RQ-4 towing operations on Taxiways B, C, D, E and F, tow
       crews will obtain ATC approval using Ramp Net, and will monitor Ramp Net until
       exiting those taxiways.
   8.8.3. Departures. Hawkeye is automatically authorized onto the runway when their
   assigned aircraft is cleared onto the runway. Hawkeye and assigned aircraft are a departure
   package once on the runway, and are solely responsible for safely executing the departure
   procedures on the runway, including the separation of vehicle and aircraft during the
   procedures. Accordingly, the Hawkeye is authorized to maneuver as needed to accomplish
   all departure checks for the aircraft, until all vehicles and aircraft are off the runway. When
   the RQ-4 pilot commands takeoff, Hawkeye will allow the RQ-4 to accelerate, thus creating
   distance between the aircraft and the vehicle. Hawkeye will accelerate if needed to maintain
   visual contact with the aircraft. Immediately after the RQ-4 has lift-off Hawkeye will exit the
   runway expeditiously. Hawkeye will remain with the RQ-4 for an aborted takeoff until
   emergency vehicles or a maintenance team arrives. Accompanying maintenance vehicles are
   not automatically cleared onto the runway with Hawkeye. Should additional vehicles be
   required to accompany Hawkeye, Hawkeye will coordinate for clearance to enter the runway
   with Tower.
   8.8.4. Arrival. Hawkeye will be staged on Taxiway Charlie for Runway 15 or Taxiway
   Delta for Runway 33 a minimum 15 minutes prior to arrival and will monitor the approach
   and landing from there (i.e., RQ-4 ground track, bird activity, traffic, etc). Hawkeye is
   automatically cleared onto the runway behind the RQ-4 when the aircraft crosses in front of
   Taxiway Charlie for Runway 15 or Taxiway Delta for Runway 33. Hawkeye will remain
   with the aircraft through the taxi or until the maintenance team arrives for towing.

  Accompanying maintenance vehicles are not automatically cleared onto the runway with
  Hawkeye. Should additional vehicles be required to accompany Hawkeye, Hawkeye will
  coordinate for clearance to enter the runway with Tower.
     8.8.4.1. Maintenance vehicles may enter the runway after receiving ATC permission, but
     must remain in trail behind both the RQ-4 and Hawkeye during landing. Hawkeye may
     relay runway clearance to maintenance crews upon receiving permission from ATC.
     8.8.4.2. Maintenance crews will normally enter the runway from the taxiway nearest to
     where the aircraft stops.

                                   MC-12 OPERATIONS

9.1. MC-12 VFR DEPARTURES. MC-12 VFR departures will be accomplished in VMC
only. When requesting clearance from Ground Control, pilots shall include call sign, requested
altitude, direction of turn on departure, and orbiting area. Example “BEALE GROUND (Call
Sign), REQUEST (Sector departure and altitude).” Pattern delay requests will also be made on
initial contact with ground for tower coordination.
9.2. AIRSPACE SCHEDULING.
   9.2.1. Schedule MOA/ATCAA usage with 9 RW scheduling office as published in the DoD
   Area Planning guide (AP/1). If the time requested is outside the MOA/ATCAA’s published
   hours, scheduling will coordinate with the controlling agency to issue appropriate NOTAMs.
   Oakland Center is the controlling authority for MOA/ATCAA entry/exit and real-time
   activity status.
   9.2.2. File the LIBERTY CHINA stereo route with the remark “Delay in CHINA MOA ___
   minutes.” All flight plans into the CHINA MOA must be filed IFR.
   9.2.3. Prior to MYV 360/028, request a CHINA area and an altitude block from Oakland
   Center.
   9.2.4. CHINA MOA/ATCAA. Area altitudes are normally 3,000’ AGL up to and including
   FL230 (Note: FL180-230 portion is ATCAA). Lateral limits are as depicted on aeronautical
   charts (not radial/DME defined).
9.3. MC-12 TACTICAL ARRIVALS. Beale tower must approve tactical arrivals prior to
entering inner ring of Class C airspace (5 NM). Tactical arrival will be accomplished in VMC
only.
   9.3.1. Defined as a VFR arrival through a VFR entry point unrestricted descent to 5,100’
   MSL or 3,600’ MSL as coordinated with Northern California TRACON (NCT), then
   continuing to a random steep/high overhead approach. Pilots will coordinate with NCT prior
   to reaching the VFR entry point or with Beale Tower if initiating procedure from the VFR
   pattern.
       9.3.1.1. Request tactical arrival recovery with NCT. Example: “(Call Sign) REQUEST
       (Crow/Bronco/Raven/Stalker) VIA (VFR entry point), 5,100’ WITH (ATIS CODE).”
       NCT will coordinate with Beale Tower for tactical arrival availability. Crews will
       contact Tower as soon as possible, but no later than the VFR entry point. Crews shall
       report the VFR entry points. Tower may hold aircraft at the entry points as well as
       COWBOY and PISTOL (if executing the BRONCO approach).
       9.3.1.2. While in the Beale pattern, tactical arrivals may be requested with Tower. Pilots
       shall request: (Call Sign), REQUEST (pattern), at (Altitude), i.e. "COUGAR TWO ONE
       REQUEST BRONCO THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED". Controllers shall issue:
       (Call Sign) (pattern) (altitude) APPROVED or alternate instructions, i.e., "COUGAR
       TWO ONE BRONCO APPROACH APPROVED THREE THOUSAND SIX
       HUNDRED"

  9.3.2. Random Steep Offset Straight-In (Stalker).
     9.3.2.1. Stalker is the standard pattern for MC-12 aircraft returning to Beale.
     9.3.2.2. Approach shall begin above 3,600’ MSL at distance one mile to every 1,000’
     (for example, 10 miles at 10,000’ MSL), offset up to 45° either side of extended
     centerline. Aircraft shall commence approach at 140 knots, descend at 1,000’ per mile,
     and establish normal 3° glidepath, rolling out no later than a 1/2 mile final (see
     Attachment 15). Once an MC-12W is cleared a Stalker approach, the aircraft shall
     proceed direct to a point on the extended runway centerline. Additional maneuvering
     airspace will require coordination with tower (see Attachment 15).
  9.3.3. Random Steep Abeam (Bronco). Bronco is a high-speed (180-220 knots) approach
  to a high-energy circling maneuver flown from the east or west at 3,600’ MSL or 5,100’
  MSL. Aircraft will enter at mid-field and maintain 3,600’ or 5,100’ MSL until turning east
  downwind and slowing to 140 knots for Runway 15/33 (see Attachment 13).
  9.3.4. Random Steep High Overhead (Crow). Crow is a high-speed, high overhead
  pattern flown at 3,600’ MSL or 5,100’ MSL. Aircraft will enter 3-5 NM initial between 180-
  220 knots, slowing to 140 knots on base turn (see Attachment 12).
  9.3.5. 45-to-Downwind (Raven). Raven is a high-speed (180-220 knots) rectangular pattern
  with a 45° entry at midfield. Aircraft will enter at 3,600’ MSL or 5,100’ MSL and descend
  upon turning downwind. Aircraft will slow to 140 knots on base turn (see Attachment 14).
9.4. MC-12 STEREO ROUTES.
  9.4.1. IFR Routes. AM Ops maintains the following coded routes for 9 RW-assigned MC-
  12 aircrews. Altitudes other than those listed may be requested from ATC.
     9.4.1.1. LIBERTY CHINA - Fly runway heading, radar vectors MYV 360/030 D0+15,

     altitude 3,000’ MSL.
  9.4.2. Butte View VFR Route. AM Ops maintains the coded route for 9 RW-assigned MC-
  12 aircrews departing BAFB VFR. ATC clearance phraseology will be: “(Call Sign),
  BUTTE VIEW, DEPARTURE FREQUENCY ______, SQUAWK ______.” Depart VFR,
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 49


   D2+30, BAB. VFR hemispheric altitudes apply while en route to training orbits. Once
   established in training orbit, inform controlling agency of operational altitude block.
9.5. MC-12W Low Stack Operations
   9.5.1. MC-12W training orbits may be flown from 17,000’ MSL to 4,100’ MSL. The
   minimum altitude may be reduced to 3,500’ MSL with a 9 OG/CC waiver, coordinated by
   the SOF. Operations below 6000’ MSL are defined as “Low Stack”.
   9.5.2. The MC-12W Operation Supervisor will advise the SOF when Low Stack operations
   are required and that status will be annotated under the MC-12W status in SOF Buddy.
   9.5.3. The minimum stack altitude which allows for tactical arrivals is 4,100 feet. Tactical
   arrivals will commence at 3,600’ MSL, ensuring a minimum of 500 feet vertical separation
   from stacked aircraft. Tactical arrivals are not permitted during stack operations below 4,100’
   MSL.
   9.5.4. During stack operations below 4,100’ MSL, recovery procedures will consist of an
   IFR clearance to an instrument approach. Once the instrument approach has been executed
   subsequent VFR patterns at 1600’ MSL with tower may be performed, conditions permitting.
   9.5.5. Tower shall include an advisory on the ATIS when low stack operations are in
   progress.

                                          Chapter 10

              AERO CLUB (FLIGHT TRAINING CENTER) OPERATIONS

10.1. LOCAL FLYING AREA.
   10.1.1. Dimensions. The BAFB Aero Club has defined their local flying area as extending
   to 50 NM from the BAB TACAN (on-field), excluding the region where mountainous terrain
   rises above 5,000’ MSL.
        10.1.1.1. The excluded mountainous terrain is located generally north and east of BAFB
        from a point at Highway 50, approximately 8 NM west of Placerville airport, north to
        Emigrant Gap, northwest to the 50 NM boundary, approximately 4 NM north of Sterling
        City
        10.1.1.2. Aero Club aircraft may operate in the local flying area without filing a cross-
        country flight plan. This is an all-purpose area designated primarily to support student
        instruction (other than crosscountry training), local checkout and transition training,
        instrument training, and check rides.
10.2. VFR TRAFFIC PATTERN. (See paragraph 5.4 and Attachment 8).
10.3. PRACTICE AREAS. The Flight Training Center has designated four practice areas in
the student local flying area, all within a 25 NM radius of the BAB TACAN:

Table 10.1. Practice Area Dimensions/Airports.
 AREA           DIMENSIONS                                       AIRPORTS
 PA-1           South of the BAFB and Marysville surface;        Lincoln, Auburn
                outside of the International (“Capital”)
                surface area; east of Highway 70; west of
                Highway 49
 PA-2           West of Highway 70; south of Highway 20;         Marysville/Yuba County, Yuba
                outside BAFB and Sacramento Class C              City/Sutter County, Colusa County
                airspace
 PA-3           West of Highway 70; north of Highway 20          Oroville
 PA-4           East of the BAFB housing area, north of          Nevada County
                Camp Far West, 3 NM east of Nevada County
                Airport; outside of BAFB Class C
10.4. FLIGHT PLANS. All Aero Club flights must file an IFR or VFR flight plan to arrive or
depart BAFB (see paragraph 2.9).
   10.4.1. The pilot in command is responsible for closing a VFR flight plan that originates or
   terminates off station, and an IFR flight plan to an uncontrolled airfield. All IFR flight plans
   and VFR “round robin” flight plans are automatically closed upon fullstop landing at BAFB.
   10.4.2. “Local VFR” may be filed on a flight plan if the entire flight will be under VFR
   conditions, within the local flying area, originating from and terminating at BAFB.
   10.4.3. Nut Tree airport (VCB) or Sacramento Executive airport (SAC) may be considered
   within 50 NM for purposes of flight planning.
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                               51


   10.4.4. Flight training students under “local VFR” may conduct practice landings at any
   airport within the local flying area, provided the airport has a paved runway at least 2,000’
   long and 50’ wide. If the airport is not listed in Table 10.3, it must be identified in the
   remarks section of the flight plan.
10.5. GROUND OPERATIONS.
   10.5.1. Engine Runs. Maintenance engine runs may be performed on the ramp in front of
   the Aero Club hangar and must be coordinated with AM Ops prior to start. When the airfield
   is closed, engine runs must be coordinated with Security Forces (x2131).
      10.5.1.1. Aero Club maintenance personnel shall provide aircraft type, tail number,
      engine run location, and call back number. AM Ops shall relay the information to Tower.
      10.5.1.2. Maintenance personnel shall call ATC on 121.6 to request engine run, monitor
      the frequency throughout the engine run, and advise tower when the run is complete.
   10.5.2. Aircraft shall not taxi outside of the Aero Club (Skyhawk) Ramp without clearance
   from Ground Control.
   10.5.3. Use caution in and around the ends of the runway (hammerheads) for U-2 and RQ-4
   Mobile traffic. As a general rule, Aero Club aircraft should never hold on the taxiway
   between the runway and Mobile traffic. Aero Club will give way to any “active” Mobile
   (light bar illuminated). Aircraft shall enter and exit their parking ramp via Taxiway B.
      10.5.3.1. Runway 15 Departures. When Mobiles are using Taxiway B, Aero Club
      aircraft will hold short of the runway while remaining on the south side of Taxiway B.
      10.5.3.2. Runway 33 Departures. Unless directed otherwise by ATC, Aero Club
      aircraft will taxi to Taxiway C for an intersection takeoff; 4,500’ of runway available.
10.6. DEPARTURES AND ARRIVALS
   10.6.1. Departures. After reaching a safe turning altitude, VFR departures will turn
   westbound (unless ATC approves otherwise) and fly parallel to North Beale Road on the
   north side.
   10.6.2. VFR Arrivals. Normally, Aero Club aircraft will enter the VFR traffic pattern from
   the west (see Attachment 8). Use extreme caution for T-38 and U2 aircraft operating west
   of the runway between 640’and 2,100’ MSL.
10.7. SPECIAL VFR. Special VFR departures are not authorized in Aero Club aircraft.
Special VFR arrivals are permitted when there is no conflicting base flying activity.
10.8. LOST COMMUNICATIONS PROCEDURES. Aero Club flights experiencing lost
communications in the local area will divert to Yuba County/Marysville (MYV) airport.
 52                                                    BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012


                                          Chapter 11

                                  SPECIAL OPERATIONS

11.1. HAZARDOUS CARGO. Aircraft carrying hazardous materials shall park on Taxiway F
between Taxiways D and E facing north. Hot Cargo Pad (HCP) is located 2,000’ north of
Taxiway E on Taxiway F.
11.2. HOT ARMAMENT. ATC will notify AM Ops as soon as practical of arrivals with hot
armament. Aircraft with hot armament (live munitions) will taxi to the south side of Taxiway E
to have their munitions secured (pinned). Aircraft will then taxi to the apron at the end of
Taxiway M and park facing the gun berms, no closer than 48’ from other aircraft. Tie-down is
available in these spots. Taxiway M is not lit (see restrictions in paragraph 4.3).
11.3. NATIONAL   AIRBORNE     OPERATIONS     CENTER      (NAOC)     ALERT
PROCEDURES. Refer to Beale AFB OPLAN 84-12, Rebound Echo Support for detailed
NAOC procedures.
11.4. MACHINE GUN AND EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL RANGES.
   11.4.1. M-60 Firing Range. A firing range for M60 machine gun and M-148 grenade
   launcher is located east of the airfield (see Attachment 21).
       11.4.1.1. The Small Arms Branch of the 9 SFS is responsible for range scheduling.
       9 SFS will notify AM Ops when the range is activated. AM Ops will notify ATC;
       aircraft will be advised by a blanket transmission and thereafter by ATIS.
       11.4.1.2. 9 SFS will actively control M-60 firing so that it does not occur with aircraft
       flying east of the airfield (i.e., on east closed pattern or SFO). Use of practice grenade
       rounds is not restricted.
   11.4.2. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). The EOD range is located east of the airfield
   at MGRS grid coordinates 3933 3400. Approximate location is depicted in Attachment 21.
   EOD shall contact Tower on the Ramp Net for approval prior to each detonation, and again
   when the operation is complete and the range is clear
11.5. DISTINGUISHED VISITOR PROCEDURES.
   11.5.1. Security. For security reasons, DV arrival and departure coordination shall be
   limited to the DV code, aircraft call sign, and pertinent movement/position information, and
   ATC instructions. A DV’s name, rank, title, duty position, and business shall never be
   transmitted.
   11.5.2. Arrival Notification. ATC will notify AMOPS as soon as the DV flight’s
   “inbound” is received from Approach Control (normally 10 to 15 NM from touchdown at
   BAFB). AMOPS will notify 9 RW/CP immediately after receiving the “inbound” from
   ATC.
11.6. SILENT LAUNCH PROCEDURES
   11.6.1. Concept. During a Silent Launch, normal control instructions are replaced by
   predetermined signals appropriate for the mission and agreed upon by ATC and the aircrews
   involved.
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                             53


  11.6.2. General Rules. The following rules apply in all real-world or simulated radio
  sensitive environments at BAFB:
     11.6.2.1. Radio transmissions will be limited to those essential for safety. Anyone may
     terminate Silent Launch in the interest of safety, i.e., “BEALE TOWER ON GUARD,
     TERMINATE SILENT LAUNCH.” If it becomes necessary to cancel a takeoff, ATC
     shall instruct “cancel takeoff clearance” on both Tower frequencies and on Guard (243.0
     MHz).
     11.6.2.2. Tail numbers instead of call signs shall be used during radio checks.
     11.6.2.3. “Silent Launch” (or similar terms) shall not be transmitted except as provided
     in paragraph 11.6.2.1 above.
     11.6.2.4. As an anti-hijacking measure, ATC shall coordinate with the SOF to verify
     aircraft’s location prior to aircraft taxi.
     11.6.2.5. Both aircraft and U-2/RQ-4 Mobiles shall visually monitor the BAFB Tower
     for light gun signals. Light gun signals for U-2s will be directed toward the Mobile;
     signals for formations will be directed toward the lead aircraft.
  11.6.3. Standard Procedures. Mission commanders must coordinate case-by-case specific
  procedures with 9 OSS/OSA (Airfield Operations). The following procedures are standard:
     11.6.3.1. Just prior to engine start, the Mobile driver calls the SOF to confirm tail
     number and request clearance. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) may also be used.
     11.6.3.2. ATC delivers clearances directly to the SOF. SOF relays clearances back to the
     Mobile via telephone or LMR.
     11.6.3.3. Pilots automatically taxi to the runway hold line while monitoring Ground
     frequency, hold short monitoring Tower frequency, and await the takeoff clearance light
     gun signal.
     11.6.3.4. Traffic permitting, ATC clears the aircraft for takeoff 5 minutes prior to
     scheduled departure time.
     11.6.3.5. After receiving takeoff clearance signal, Mobile leads the aircraft onto the
     runway and takeoff roll is commenced at scheduled departure time.
     11.6.3.6. Silent Launch procedures normally terminate when the aircraft is airborne and
     initial radio contact with Departure Control is made. Mobile resumes radio
     communications with ATC to report off the runway.
11.7. AEROMEDICAL AIRLIFT SUPPORT.
  11.7.1. Arrivals. AM Ops will provide type aircraft, ETA, parking location, total patient
  load information i.e. number of litters, ambulatory, and pertinent additional information to
  the Tower, Clinic, 9 RW/ CP, and Fire Department. BAFB Tower will inform AM Ops
  when the aircraft arrives in the local area and will provide ATC priority handling according
  to FAAOJ 7110.65.
  11.7.2. Departures. AM Ops will relay the ETD, patient load information i.e. number of

11.8. AIRBORNE FUEL DUMPING.
   11.8.1. Fuel dumping should take place at as high an altitude as possible and away from
   populated areas, agricultural areas, or water sources.
   11.8.2. Except in an emergency, aircraft commanders shall notify the 9 RW SOF and the
   appropriate ATC agency prior to dumping fuel.
   11.8.3. In any non-emergency situation fuel should be dumped from published holding at the
   BAB 333042, at or above FL 250. A U-2 with a hung pogo will dump fuel along the BAB
   032 radial between 2030 NM, at or above FL 250.
11.9. EXERCISES. The 9 OSS/OSA Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) must
be briefed at least 48 hours in advance of any exercise or inspection (e.g. ORE, ORI, MARE)
that involves Airfield Operations personnel or airfield facilities (to include ATCALS). The
AOF/CC must approve, in advance, exercises that include relocating airfield operations
personnel to alternate facilities or to shelter areas.
   11.9.1. The Tower watch supervisor must ensure ATC facility participation does not degrade
   services. The watch supervisor may interrupt or discontinue facility participation in any
   exercise if flight safety is in question or it interferes with the recovery of emergency aircraft.
   11.9.2. ATC personnel may wear gas masks in support of OREs/ORIs, consistent with Wing
   requirements, however the watch supervisor and coordinator (safety observers) must not
   wear a gas mask during facility operations while under simulated threat conditions. The
   watch supervisor has the authority to direct controllers to remove gas masks in the interest of
   flight safety. When an aircraft declares an emergency or is in distress, controllers in direct
   communications with the aircraft must remove the gas mask. Controllers wearing a gas mask
   must be equipped with the Gas Mask Communication System Interface Equipment when
   actively controlling air traffic.
11.10. NO-FLIGHT PLAN ARRIVALS. If ATC cannot locate a flight plan in the ATC
system, ATC will advise AM Ops and tell the pilot to contact AM Ops on pilot-to-dispatch. AM
Ops will attempt to verify a valid flight plan by contacting the appropriate Flight Service Station,
Command Post, ATC and/or point of departure. If AM Ops is unable to verify the flight plan, a
landing clearance will not be issued unless the aircraft declares an emergency.
11.11. UNAUTHORIZED LANDINGS. Unauthorized landings when the airfield is open will
be handled IAW with AFI 10-1001 and appropriate ATC/AM Ops checklists.
11.12. UNUSUAL MANEUVERS. Maneuvers requiring a waiver to Federal Aviation
Regulations (FAR) must be submitted to the Airspace Manager (9 OSS/OSOH) at least 30 days
in advance to provide adequate coordination time. These waivers require 9 OG/CC approval
prior to forwarding to the FAA.
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   55


                                           Chapter 12

                                EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

12.1. EMERGENCY DECLARATION. An emergency is a distress or urgency condition
when aircraft or aircrew safety is questionable and fire and rescue assistance and/or priority
traffic sequencing is required to minimize the risk. If there is any doubt whether a situation is an
emergency, it should be handled as an emergency. The pilot, U-2/RQ-4 Mobiles, SOF, ATC
personnel, maintenance personnel, 9 RW/CC, or 9 OG/CC may declare an aircraft emergency.
12.2. CRASH ALARM SYSTEMS.
   12.2.1. Primary Crash Alarm System. ATC activates the primary crash alarm system.
   Agencies on the primary network are: Flight Medicine/Ambulatory Services, Fire
   Department, and AM Ops. Additional monitoring (receive only) agencies are Security
   Forces and Base Command Post.
       12.2.1.1. ATC will activate the primary crash phone when:
           12.2.1.1.1. An emergency is declared.
           12.2.1.1.2. Any event in this chapter occurs.
           12.2.1.1.3. An actual or simulated disaster occurs.
           12.2.1.1.4. A no-radio (NORDO) aircraft is approaching without transponder code.
           (N/A if it is known that only a radio malfunction exists).
           12.2.1.1.5. The watch supervisor deems necessary.
       12.2.1.2. ATC will test the primary crash phone daily between 0730L-0800L during
       normal operating hours or immediately upon opening during other than normal airfield
       operating hours.
   12.2.2. Secondary Crash Net (SCN). AM Ops activates the SCN. Agencies on the SCN are:
   9 MSG/CC, Fire Department, Base Command Post, Maintenance Operations Control Center
   (MOC), Crash Recovery, Ambulatory Services, Flight Medicine, Weather, Emergency
   Management, Safety, Security Forces, EOD, Public Affairs, and Physiological Support
   Squadron. Note: IAW AFI 13-204V3, the SCN will only be used to relay information
   critical to aircraft and airfield operations. Use other forms of communication to relay non-
   critical base information. Requests for additions/deletions to SCN must be coordinated
   through 9 OSS/OSA and forwarded to the 9 OSS/CC for approval/disapproval.
       12.2.2.1. AM Ops will activate the SCN immediately following primary crash phone
       notification.
       12.2.2.2. AM Ops will test the SCN daily at 0800L during normal operating hours or
       immediately upon opening during other than normal airfield operating hours.
   12.2.3. Fire Department Land Mobile Radio Crash Net. If excessive background noise or
   chatter make continuous monitoring of the crash net impracticable, the Tower may terminate
   continuous monitoring.
       12.2.3.1. Tower shall notify the Fire Department when not monitoring the crash net.
 56                                                  BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012


      12.2.3.2. During emergencies or when otherwise deemed necessary the Fire Department
      will notify the Tower to monitor the crash net.
12.3. EMERGENCY CONTROL PROCEDURES.
   12.3.1. Time permitting, 9 RW emergency aircraft will contact the SOF.               SOF
   responsibilities are governed by AFI 11-418. Pilots flying RQ-4 aircraft are available by
   phone at the Global Hawk Operations Center.
   12.3.2. When an in-flight emergency intends to land at BAFB, ATC will transmit over
   emergency frequencies, “ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE BEALE AREA, IN-
   FLIGHT EMERGENCY IN PROGRESS, ETA _____, RUNWAY CLOSURE IS/IS NOT
   ANTICIPATED.” ATC will obtain an ETA. Aircraft flying in the area should check fuel
   status and coordinate with ATC to land at least 5 minutes before the stated emergency
   aircraft ETA or hold until the emergency is terminated.
   12.3.3. When an emergency aircraft reaches a point 5 minutes to fly or 10 flying miles from
   the runway (whichever occurs first), ATC shall suspend all departures, full-stop arrivals and
   touch-and-go approaches, unless directed otherwise by the SOF.
      12.3.3.1. Low approaches are permitted before the emergency aircraft arrives, as long as
      wake turbulence will not adversely affect the emergency aircraft. Restricted low
      approaches are permitted after the arrival (see paragraph 3.9).
      12.3.3.2. ATC shall direct aircraft to hold their position when emergency vehicles are
      responding or repositioning on the airfield. ATC may resume taxiing aircraft with
      approval from the Incident Commander (IC)/Fire Department.
   12.3.4. During in-flight emergencies military aircraft inbound to Beale may request
   frequency 269.6. This frequency will be used by Northern California TRACON and Beale
   Tower to provide the emergency aircraft a single frequency approach. When approved by
   the appropriate ATC facility, the SOF may use the frequency to communicate with the
   emergency aircraft.
12.4. EMERGENCY TERMINATION. Only the IC will terminate the emergency and will
notify ATC. ATC will relay the emergency termination time to AM Ops.
12.5. RUNWAY CHECK FOLLOWING EMERGENCIES.
   12.5.1. Runway operations will normally be suspended when an emergency aircraft touches
   down and shall not be resumed until AMOPS has inspected the landing area and declared
   runway operations resumed. However if the SOF waives the FOD check, do not suspend
   runway operations and refer to para 12.5.2.
   12.5.2. The SOF may waive requirement for runway inspection for 9 RW aircraft following
   an emergency if, in his/her judgment, a FOD check is unnecessary. In such case, SOF
   assumes responsibility for runway FOD condition until the next runway inspection is
   conducted. SOF waivers of the check will be entered in the AF Form 3616.
   12.5.3. If the runway inspection will be delayed due to AM Ops workload, the SOF may
   authorize a Mobile to conduct the inspection and resume runway operations. In this case,
   SOF will call AM Ops with the results of the inspection. Mobiles must be certified by the
   AFM to perform checks.
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 57


12.6. VISUAL CHECK OF EMERGENCY AIRCRAFT. Pilots will normally fly a low pass
at 500’ AGL, offset between the control tower and the runway. At night, personnel may be
positioned near the approach/strobe lights. When a U-2 Mobile is inspecting while in chase, the
U-2 low pass will be over the runway at or above 10’ AGL. RQ-4 Mobiles will not chase U-2s,
but may provide visual inspection from a stationary vehicle clear of the runway. RQ-4 aircraft
are restricted from performing a visual check fly-by.
12.7. EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER ACTIVATION
   12.7.1. An “active” Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) is one whose signal is received
   outside the authorized test window (the first 5 minutes of each hour for no more than 3 audio
   sweeps).
   12.7.2. Report active ELT signals to the nearest ATC facility. Include the frequency and a
   description of the signal (strong, weak, intermittent, continuous, etc.).
       12.7.2.1. ATC will forward reports to AM Ops and Northern California TRACON.
       12.7.2.2. ATC will report termination time to AM Ops when ELT is no longer heard.
       AM Ops will notify Aircrew Life Support, Survival Equipment, Physiological Support
       Squadron, and Aero Club (if transmission is on 121.5).
   12.7.3. Agencies shall notify AM Ops when the search has been completed. AM Ops will
   notify ATC.
12.8. HOT BRAKES.
   12.8.1. Hot brakes areas are on Taxiways B and E for Runways 33 and 15, respectively. If
   hot brakes are confirmed or suspected, the pilot will notify ground control.
   12.8.2. RQ-4 aircraft will exit at Taxiway “C” or “D”, if able, before ground support
   personnel have an opportunity to confirm hot brakes. If unable to clear the runway,
   coordination is required to confirm hot brakes on the runway prior to towing. If hot brakes
   are confirmed, the aircraft will remain on the taxiway or runway until cleared by the IC to
   continue taxi or towing.
12.9. HUNG ORDNANCE. Aircraft unable to drop hung ordnance will be parked on the south
side of Taxiway E no closer than 48’ from other aircraft, heading 170 degrees. AM Ops will
close Taxiway E until EOD declares the area safe.
12.10. EXTERNAL STORES JETTISON.
   12.10.1. Emergency Jettison. If safe flight cannot continue to the designated jettison area
   and the pilot determines that immediate jettison is required, pilot judgment will determine the
   action taken. In either case, any external stores jettison constitutes an emergency. The
   procedures of this section apply to use of the designated jettison area.
   12.10.2. VFR Conditions. ATC will hold taxiing aircraft until the drop is completed. ATC
   will visually scan the jettison area for personnel or equipment.
       12.10.2.1. AM Ops will request that 9 SFS close Gavin-Mandery Road from N Street to
       the main gate. 9 SFS will notify AM Ops when this area is clear of traffic.
       12.10.2.2. Aircraft should maintain at or above 2,000’ MSL until commencing jettison
       pass.
 58                                                  BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012


       12.10.2.3. The jettison pass should be offset to the right of Runway 15, at or above 700’
       MSL. The aircraft should avoid overflying populated areas. The target is the grassy area
       west of the overrun.
       12.10.2.4. Runway operations are automatically suspended following the jettison until
       AM Ops has completed a runway FOD check.
   12.10.3. IFR Conditions. Contact Northern California TRACON for vectors to the IFR
   drop zone at the SUU 188/020 DME (northwest corner of Suisun Bay).
12.11. CONTROLLED BAILOUT. The controlled bailout area is established to provide safe
terrain for recovery and to expedite search efforts. Bailout should be accomplished flying
outbound on the BAB 057 radial, as close as possible to 3 DME. This location is approximately
¾ NM northwest of the circular water reservoir.
12.12. EVACUATION OF AIRFIELD OPERATIONS FLIGHT FACILITIES
   12.12.1. ATC Evacuation. See 9 OSS/OSAT OI 13-204, Beale Tower Operations
   Instructions for detailed procedures.
       12.12.1.1. All personnel will evacuate the control tower when wind gusts reach or are
       forecasted to reach 50 knots.
       12.12.1.2. If evacuating because of a fire or bomb threat, all personnel will move to the
       AM Ops building 1060, and await further instructions.
       12.12.1.3. Time permitting, the Tower Watch Supervisor will accomplish the following
       actions before evacuating:
          12.12.1.3.1. Activate primary crash alarm system.
          12.12.1.3.2. Notify Northern California TRACON.
          12.12.1.3.3. Broadcast the following on appropriate ATC frequencies:
          “ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, BEALE TOWER IS EVACUATING. ALL
          AIRCRAFT        CONTACT       NORCAL   APPROACH     FOR  FURTHER
          INSTRUCTIONS. ALL TAXIING AIRCRAFT, TAXI TO PARKING.” If bomb
          threat, add, “MAINTAIN 1,000’ CLEARANCE FROM THE CONTROL TOWER.”
          12.12.1.3.4. No alternate ATC facility exists.
   12.12.2. AM Ops Evacuation. If time permits, AM Ops will activate the SCN and pass the
   following information:      “AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT AND WEATHER ARE
   EVACUATING DUE TO (Reason) AND WILL RELOCATE TO (Location)”. AM Ops will
   evacuate to the control tower IAW facility instructions. The SCN will be replaced by
   conference call.
12.13. HYDRAZINE EMERGENCIES. U-2s and F-16s contain hydrazine. If leaked, the
toxin might first be detected by an ammonia scent in the air. Evacuate immediately to at least
100’ upwind or 500’ downwind. Refer to BAFBI 21-180, Hydrazine Response Procedures.
12.14. HUNG POGO PROCEDURES. The pilot shall declare an emergency. If the pogo falls
free, the emergency may be terminated and the sortie may continue
BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                               59


   12.14.1. VFR Conditions. Maintain VFR, climb to at or above 1,100’ MSL while
   maneuvering to the drop zone. Avoid flying over populated areas. Maintain at or above
   1,100' MSL and fly 800’ offset west of the runway between the runway and the main gate to
   attempt to dislodge the pogo IAW U-2 Flight Manual procedures and IFG procedures. When
   practicing hung pogo procedures, coordinate with ATC.
   12.14.2. IFR Conditions. If weather precludes VFR flight, coordinate with ATC to remain
   clear of populated areas and fly an instrument approach to a full-stop straight ahead on the
   runway. Aircraft will dump fuel prior to the approach to preclude landing heavyweight.
12.15. AIRBORNE LOST COMMUNICATIONS.
   12.15.1. Pilots requesting emergency handling will squawk 7700. If experiencing lost
   communications but not declaring an emergency, squawk 7600 and take action in accordance
   with the FAA AIM. Controllers shall provide emergency handling to code 7700 aircraft and
   NORDO non-emergency service to code 7600 aircraft.
   12.15.2. Preferred local No Radio (NORDO) procedure, if in VFR conditions, is to fly an
   overhead pattern with offset initial and rock the wings. Always look for light gun signals if
   lost communication is suspected on the airport or within tower controlled airspace.
   12.15.3. An RQ-4 with radio failure that is communicating with ATC via telephone must
   receive priority handling. ATC shall suspend arrivals and departures until the RQ-4 lands.
12.16. RQ-4 LOST LINK PROCEDURES (C2). RQ-4 aircraft will automatically squawk
7600, fly the pre-planned profile and land. The pilot may still have radio communication with
ATC. The pilot will use radio and/or land lines to provide ATC situational awareness and pre-
planned routing, but will be unable to change the pre-set profile or command a go-around.
12.17. HUNG FLARE PROCEDURES.
   12.17.1. If flares are dispensed, inform Beale tower that a hung flare check is required.
   Immediately after exiting the runway, an aircrew member shall exit the aircraft and perform a
   hung flare check.
   12.17.2. If hung flare check is positive, pilot will notify ATC and declare an emergency. If
   the aircraft exited at Taxiway B or C, tower will direct a back-taxi on the runway to exit
   Taxiway D or E and proceed to the hung flare area on Taxiway M (see Attachment 22).
   Note: If Taxiway Mike is not available (i.e. nighttime, closed for repairs, in use by other
   aircraft), the hazardous cargo spot on Taxiway Foxtrot will be used.
   12.17.3. Once the aircraft is within the Taxiway M revetments, aim the flare toward the
   south berm. Establish a 600’ cordon around the aircraft IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosives
   Safety Standards. Aircrew will remain inside the aircraft until the flare is declared safe.
 60                                                     BEALEAFBI11-250 1 OCTOBER 2012



12.18. RQ-4 Termination Procedures. Any time the pilot deems the RQ-4 incapable of
continued flight, successful divert, landing, or safety is jeopardized, it may be desirable to
terminate (crash) the aircraft at the pre-planned location. Pilots will direct the aircraft towards a
0.5 nm radius area located at the BAB 067 radial 1.7 DME to the extent possible (Attachment
20). ATC will clear the airspace en route to the crash point and assist in post-crash response.
