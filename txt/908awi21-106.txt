                                                                                           Pages: 5

This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. It
gives procedures on monitoring actual aircraft usage and documenting crack and corrosion findings to
obtain data for updating inspection and maintenance technical orders. It applies to all units and personnel
in the 908th Airlift Wing. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office
of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication as
prescribed by AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual Program (FMP). Route AF Form 847 to the 908 MXS/
MXMF at Maxwell AFB AL. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-123 (will convert to
AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.


1. Inspection and Reporting Requirements.
   1.1. Maintenance Requirements. All safety critical structural inspections have been identified in the
   1C-130A-6, 1C-130A-3, 1C-130A-23, 1C-130A-36 series Air Force Technical Orders (TOs). Current
   examples of the verbiage used in the TO to identify the Airlift Wing Aircraft-Structural Integrity Pro-
   gram (ASIP) inspection requirements are as follows:
       1.1.1. TO 1C-130A-6, Special Inspections, System Airframe (System 11000), paragraph 18.
       1.1.2. TO 1C-130A-6WC-15, card number 1-349, paragraph 1, (NDI WORK DECK).
   1.2. All ASIP inspections listed in the applicable TO’s are required to be reported in the Automated
   Inspection, Repair Corrosion and Aircraft Tracking system (AIRCAT), and Inspection Corrosion and
   Repair Reporting (ICARR) program. An entry into the ICARR Program must be completed each time
   an inspection is accomplished or a discrepancy requiring a maintenance action is documented against
   the following system.
       1.2.1. 11XXX Primary structure and skin.
2                                                                        908AWI21-106 17 JULY 2007


       1.2.2. 13XXX Landing gear.
    1.3. TO 1C-130A-3 also has numerous occasions when ICARR reporting is required. Data collection
    is crucial in that it provides critical information to assist the Chief of Maintenance, Major Command
    and Warner-Robins Air Logistic Center (WR-ALC) in making fleet decisions.
    1.4. All ASIP and ICARR data input shall be accomplished within 5 days of completion of inspection
    or repair. Coordinate all data entry requirements with the Project Officer prior to database input.
    1.5. Work Center Responsibilities.
       1.5.1. Project Officer.
           1.5.1.1. Act as OPR for this operating instruction.
           1.5.1.2. Identify ASIP training requirements, method of documentation, and provide training
           to appropriate personnel.
           1.5.1.3. Review ASIP correspondence and ensure requests for action receives prompt atten-
           tion.
           1.5.1.4. During deployments all required ASIP and ICARR reporting will be accomplished
           while deployed. If program administrative needs are not available, it will be reported upon
           return to home station.
       1.5.2. Maintenance Flight Chief.
           1.5.2.1. Establish, maintain, and periodically review for accuracy an ASIP inspection list doc-
           umenting each aircraft’s inspections. Ensure the inspection list is annotated as the inspections
           are completed.
           1.5.2.2. Establish preprinted dock worksheets with the required inspections, and ensure that
           the individuals responsible for the inspection sign off their work once completed.
           1.5.2.3. Ensure that the ASIP inspections are required for each Isochronal (ISO) Inspection
           input so erroneous/unnecessary inspections are not accomplished.
           1.5.2.4. Ensure all ASIP inspections are complied with prior to closing out the Isochronal
           Inspection.
           1.5.2.5. Coordinate all required ASIP inspections with Non Destructive Inspection (NDI) and
           structural supervision.
           1.5.2.6. Periodically review the Isochronal Inspection work cards for the latest revisions and
           accuracy.
       1.5.3. MOF Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D).
           1.5.3.1. Ensure that ASIP special inspections are properly loaded in the appropriate mainte-
           nance information system and scheduled for all assigned aircraft.
           1.5.3.2. Monitor and ensure that a master record is created for each aircraft.
           1.5.3.3. Monitor and ensure accuracy of isochronal count number and inspection for assigned
           aircraft.

2. Operations Usage Reporting Requirements.
908AWI21-106 17 JULY 2007                                                                                 3


  2.1. TO 1C-130-101 is the governing technical order that describes the flight information data that is
  required to be reported. This data is used to satisfy the individual aircraft usage tracking requirements.
  Flight Engineers will use the flight data worksheet to record required information on all missions
  flown. Flight Engineers will comply with TO 1C-130-101 in the timely and accurate reporting of Air-
  craft usage into the Usage Data Input (UDI) software to ensure timely accomplishment of critical
  inspections. Ensure Inspection, Reporting Requirements, and Maintenance Requirements have been
  identified in the 1C-130A-6, 1C-130A-3, 1C-130A-23, 1C-130A-36 series TOs.
     2.1.1. Current examples of the verbiage used in the TOs to identify the ASIP inspection require-
     ments are as follows:
         2.1.1.1. TO 1C-130A-6, Special Inspections, System Airframe (System 11000), paragraph 18.
         2.1.1.2. TO 1C-130A-6WC-15, card number 1-349, paragraph 1, (NDI WORK DECK).
