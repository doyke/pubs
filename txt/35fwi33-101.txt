This instruction implements AFPD 33-1, Information Resources Management, Command, and
Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence Systems (C4I) and outlines the
responsibilities and rules for management of radio frequencies within the jurisdiction of Misawa
Air Base. This instruction applies to all units assigned, attached, and associated to 35th Fighter
Wing who use radio frequencies in facilities and the Misawa area. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule      (RDS)     located    at    https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
Additionally, if the publication generates a report(s), alert readers in a statement and cite all
applicable Reports Control Numbers in accordance with AFI 33-324. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from
the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision updates
Frequency Management Policies set for Misawa Air Base, Japan.
1. Introduction.
   1.1. Due to increased radio frequency congestion in the Misawa area, commanders must
   manage assigned radio frequencies to meet key mission needs. Planning and coordination
 2                                                          35FWI33-101 1 SEPTEMBER 2011


     with the proper command authority is essential for all radio frequency and electromagnetic
     compatibility matters to provide an environment free from interference.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Installation Commanders are responsible for all electromagnetic radiation emanating
     from the installation and from those outlying activities hosted by the installation.
     2.2. Installation Spectrum Manager (ISM) will:
        2.2.1. Submit all frequency actions through appropriate command channels.
        2.2.2. Provide users an authorization document of assigned frequencies and operational
        parameters, upon assignment.
        2.2.3. Publish a Radio Frequency Management Instruction for the installation defining
        the management of all electromagnetic radiating devices within the manager’s area of
        responsibility.
        2.2.4. Establish a frequency management education program.
        2.2.5. Attempt to resolve interference problems at the local level.
        2.2.6. Maintain a complete list of all United States Forces Japan (USFJ) frequencies
        assigned to Misawa Air Base.
        2.2.7. Assist using organizations in the preparation of Electromagnetic Interference
        (EMI) reports.
3. Using Organization.
     3.1. Any organization that radiates electromagnetic energy will appoint a Unit Spectrum
     Manager (USM) as a point of contact (POC) for all frequency matters. This person will have
     at least 1 year retainability at Misawa Air Base.
     3.2. The USM will:
        3.2.1. Maintain the frequency authorization documents for each frequency until the
        frequency is deleted.
        3.2.2. Ensure the operation of equipment that radiates electromagnetic energy complies
        with authorized limitations and tolerance.
        3.2.3. Coordinate all frequency actions with the ISM.
        3.2.4. Ensure frequencies in use are in compliance with the frequency assignment and
        governing directives.
        3.2.5. Identify frequency needs via Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) to the
        ISM a minimum 120 days prior to required date.
        3.2.6. Investigate and prepare all required EMI reports.
        3.2.7. Review assigned frequencies annually and identify frequencies which are no
        longer in use or required. A copy of the annual review will be forwarded to the ISM.
        3.2.8. Ensure the proper authorizing Spectrum Management (SM) agency designates and
        approves operating frequencies before contracts are approved or funds committed.
35FWI33-101 1 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                3


          3.2.8.1. Coordinate with the ISM on all plans, programs, and requirements using or
          changing the use of the radio frequency spectrum.
4. Processing.
   4.1. USMs will submit all permanent, temporary, or deployed frequency requests via the
   SFAF to the ISM. The ISM will review the SFAF for completeness and forward it to
   PACAF/A6. PACAF/A6 will validate the requirement and forward to the proper assigning
   authority. PACAF/A6 will coordinate all frequency requests within Japan or at the deployed
   location. All non-temporary frequency requests must be submitted at least 120 days prior to
   the required date. Temporary requests must be submitted at least 90 days prior to required
   date.
   4.2. Request for new frequencies. USMs will submit requests with complete explanation
   and justification of the requirement. Classified frequency requirements must include the
   classification directive. An approved frequency is required prior to equipment purchase.
   4.3. Modifications. Proposed modifications to assigned frequencies will be submitted in
   writing and approved by the ISM before any changes or modifications are implemented to
   ensure no interference with other authorized users.
   4.4. Deletion of assigned frequencies. Users will notify the ISM in writing when an
   assigned frequency is no longer required.
   4.5. Temporary frequency requirements.       No frequency will be used until a temporary
   frequency assignment is received.
   4.6. Deployment frequency. All requirements for use of frequencies at a deployed location
   must be obtained through the home station ISM.
   4.7. Radio frequency interference. Due to the congestion of the radio frequency spectrum,
   users may experience interference of assigned frequencies. When interference is disruptive
   and recurring, the user will log the occurrence and submit an EMI report.
5. Policy on Consumer Products that Emit Radio Frequencies.
   5.1. The Radio Law of Japan prohibits the use of radio frequencies on which U.S.-
   manufactured products such as cordless phones, walkie-talkies, and baby monitors often
   operate. However, similar locally purchased products, specifically manufactured for use in
   Japan, can be used because these products operate on authorized frequencies.
6. Radio Controlled Model Equipment.
   6.1. Authorized radio frequencies. The Government of Japan has authorized the use of these
   frequencies for radio controlled (RC) model equipment:
      6.1.1. 26.995 MHz, 27.045 MHz, 27.095 MHz, and 27.255 MHz; 2 watts power, A1A
      and A2D emissions.
      6.1.2. 72.24 MHz, 72. 4 MHz, and 75.64 MHz; 1 watt power; A1A and A2A emissions.
   6.2. Restrictions on use of authorized frequencies.
      6.2.1. The transmitter will not exceed the parameters above.
 4                                                         35FWI33-101 1 SEPTEMBER 2011


        6.2.2. The operator, transmitter, and controlled device must be within the requirements
        of the installation.
        6.2.3. The operator must have written approval from the installation commander prior to
        operation of RC model equipment.
        6.2.4. Operation of a transmitter declared to be causing interference with another
        communications-electronic facility will stop immediately. Transmissions may resume
        when the cause of the interference is eliminated.
        6.2.5. Private organizations, such as hobby clubs, may obtain frequency authorization by
        contacting the Installation Spectrum Manager.
7. Citizens Band (CB) Radio Equipment.
     7.1. There are many types of CB radio equipment on sale throughout Japan. Such equipment
     includes 1-channel walkie-talkies, base stations, and mobiles with various channel
     capabilities. The US has set certain specific frequencies (channels) aside for citizens band.
     However, these frequencies do not correspond to the Japanese citizens’ service allocation.
     7.2. The use of CB equipment or cordless phones in Japan is not authorized under the Status
     of Forces Agreement, except as noted in paragraph 6 above. However, frequency devices
     purchased locally may be granted approval. The Installation Spectrum Manager will issue
     approval letters on a case-by-case basis.
