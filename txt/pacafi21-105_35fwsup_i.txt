2.1. Purpose of Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) and Oil Analysis Program (OAP) (AFSC
2A7X2).
   2.1.1. NDI is a group of inspection methods used to investigate the quality, integrity,
   properties and dimensions of materials and components without damaging or impairing their
   serviceability. These inspection methods primarily are liquid fluorescent penetrant, magnetic
   particle, eddy current, ultra-sonic and radiographic. NDI extends the life of aircraft, engines
   and related support equipment by detecting defects, i.e., cracks, voids, delaminations and
   foreign objects. Interpreting oil analysis results. The engine condition is assessed based on
   the diagnosis of the probable source of the wear metal.
   2.1.2. The OAP Laboratory will inform the user of the analysis results, but will not make
   maintenance recommendations unless specifically called for by technical orders. When used

   inspection, treatment, and painting as follows:
      3.13.1.1. Washing and cleaning are the primary methods of corrosion prevention. The
      required AGE wash cycles are established based on location as determined in Technical
      Orders (T.O.) 1-1-691 and 35-1-3. The AGE flight chief will enforce the use of approved
      cleaning compounds specified in the Quality Products List (QPL).
      3.13.1.2. Corrosion prevention and treatment (cleaning and corrosion removal) will be
      performed by the AGE flight to the maximum extent authorized. In addition to scheduled
      AGE washes, the AGE flight chief will ensure assigned AGE is cleaned, inspected, and
      touched up as necessary during each periodic inspection. Corrosion prevention and
      treatment beyond AGE flight capability and authorization will be scheduled into the
      appropriate fabrication flight or contractor’s work area for treatment/repairs.
 18                                              PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


      3.13.1.3. Establish a program to cycle AGE through the Corrosion element at least every
      two (2) years for inspection. This program will require 5-skill level or above ASM
      specialists (or equivalent contract personnel) to thoroughly inspect each piece of AGE for
      corrosion and determine if corrosion related repairs are needed and if the coating system
      should be replaced. The AGE Flight will develop and coordinate an AGE corrosion
      inspection schedule based on the Corrosion elements workload capability. Coordination
      between the AGE flight and the Corrosion element is critical to insure all assigned AGE
      is inspected at least bi-annually. CAMS will be used to schedule and document AGE
      painting.
          3.13.1.3.1. (Added-35FW) AGE units will be scored by ASM utilizing a locally
          developed score sheet. (attachment 1C).
      3.13.1.4. The AGE flight chief will ensure programs are established to repair nicks,
      scrapes, or other minor damage to AGE coatings. Polyurethane paint will not be applied
      over lacquer or enamel coatings without complete removal of the lacquer or enamel
      coating system prior to the application of the new polyurethane coating. AGE is to be
      properly prepared IAW T.O. 35-1-3 before applying polyurethane coatings. Personnel
      applying polyurethane coatings will be properly trained, and will adhere to all technical
      and safety directives.
   3.13.2. Ensures AGE reflectorization requirements are IAW T.O. 35-1-3.
   3.13.3. Ensures CAMS is used to schedule and document AGE painting.
   3.13.4. Ensures maintenance, servicing and inspection activity personnel are oriented to
   corrosion prevention and control.
   3.13.5. Ensures powered and non-powered AGE is cleaned, thoroughly inspected, and
   touched-up as necessary during each periodic inspection.
   3.13.6. Enforces the use of approved cleaning compounds.
   3.13.7. Schedules work beyond AGE work center capability into the appropriate fabrication
   work-center or civilian contractor’s work area for repairs/repaint.
3.14. Training and Familiarization Requirements:
   3.14.1. All aircraft and AGE maintenance personnel will receive corrosion
   prevention/control training upon initial assignment and at least annually thereafter. Aircraft
   Structural Maintenance personnel (AFSC 2A7X3) are exempt from this training.
   3.14.2. Each unit will develop and implement a corrosion prevention/control training
   program.
      3.14.2.1. Training curriculum will include:
      3.14.2.2. Familiarization of corrosion types, identification procedures, techniques, and
      preventive measures.
      3.14.2.3. Familiarization of aircraft/equipment corrosion prone areas.
      3.14.2.4. Reporting and documentation procedures.
PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                               19


   3.14.3. Courses will be tailored to meet local needs, and should be applied to specific AFSC
   requirements, as well as general information. Use of 2A7X3 personnel to assist in instruction
   or training is encouraged. A training course code will be established and training will be
   documented in CAMS.
      3.14.3.1. (Added-35FW) The Maintenance Operations Training Flight or unit
      maintenance-training manager procures and ensures currency and administration of video
      Training courses IAW AFI 21-101_35FWSUP, chapter 6.
   3.14.4. Ensures ASM trainee’s are rotated to provide the opportunity to obtain proficiency in
   most aspects of their career field associated with assigned weapon systems.
   3.14.5. (Added-35FW) The ASM section will develop a local aircraft wash training outline
   and all wash crew supervisors will receive training from the ASM section to ensure proper
   wash methods and equipment usage. A roster will be maintained by the ASM section of all
   trained wash crew supervisors. All other personnel involved with aircraft washing will
   receive OJT training offered by the ASM section or trained wash crew supervisor. This
   training will be updated in TBA by the member’s supervisor or the wash crew supervisor.
3.15. Unit Corrosion Control Program Requirements.
   3.15.1. Owning activities shall wash and clean their aircraft and support equipment.
      3.15.1.1. (Added-35FW) A complete exterior cleaning will be accomplished on all
      aircraft as directed by T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons Systems Cleaning and Corrosion
      Control, and weapon system-specific technical data. This will be accomplished during
      scheduled wash cycles.
      3.15.1.2. (Added-35FW) Proper post-wash lubrication is vital in prevention of
      corrosion. Lubrication prevents water intrusion in bearing cavities and subsequent
      corrosion damage. If technicians wash components between normal cleaning cycles
      (flight line or ―spot‖ washes), re-lubrication of the affected components is required.
   3.15.2. ASM personnel will assist the owning activities in their corrosion prevention efforts
   by accomplishing scheduled corrosion inspections on aircraft, support and test equipment.
   Assigned 2A6X2 personnel or civilian equivalent, who are trained and qualified in corrosion
   prevention and detection may perform routine corrosion inspections during daily and
   periodic inspections of assigned AGE. However, upon request, ASM personnel (AFSC
   2A7X3) will assist in assessing and/or evaluating AGE equipment for structural integrity
   and/or paint condition.
   3.15.3. Aircraft Structural Maintenance personnel shall only perform aircraft inspection
   work cards specified for accomplishment by Aircraft Structural Maintenance in the -6 T.O.
   All maintenance personnel, regardless of AFSC, shall examine each part removed and
   inspect the inside of all exposed areas for corrosion. Avionics maintenance personnel shall
   inspect the electrical connectors of avionics line replaceable units (LRUs), inside equipment
   drawers, etc, for corrosion. The use of corrosion preventative compound (CPC) should be
   applied to all areas authorized by Technical Orders. All deficiencies noted during these
   inspections will be entered in the aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A) and reported to the
   Aircraft Structural Maintenance Section for corrective action. When corrosion discrepancies
   are discovered that may affect aircraft structural integrity or safety of flight/operation or are
 20                                               PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


   beyond the using organization’s capability to evaluate/repair, an aircraft structural
   maintenance specialist will be requested.
   3.15.4. Maintenance personnel who remove/install aircraft panels and doors must ensure
   seals are serviceable and sealant is applied to panels and fasteners as specified in applicable
   aircraft technical orders.
   3.15.5. Maintenance personnel shall report all corrosion deficiencies through the CAMS
   IAW 00-20 series technical orders. Accurate documentation of maintenance actions in
   support of the corrosion control program is essential to support future manning, equipment
   requirements, training, and parts/ material procurement requirements.
   3.15.6. Maintenance painting is defined as the application of coatings to aerospace
   equipment where the existing coating system is deteriorated or missing. Maintenance
   painting must be kept to a minimum and must comply with federal, state, and local
   environmental directives. Maintenance painting of aircraft will not be accomplished solely
   for cosmetics because of environmental and overall aircraft weight and balance concerns.
      3.15.6.1. All touch-up painting will be accomplished using seam-to-seam, and will be
      masked at the edges. Where a seam is not reasonably accessible, a ―simulated‖ seam may
      be created. Unmasked (maintenance painting) spray touch-up is authorized on
      camouflaged patterned paint schemes.
      3.15.6.2. SEMPENS and paintbrush application methods are the preferred means of
      touching-up minor scratches and fastener heads. Prepackaged aerosol paint cans should
      not be used to touch up any type of defect on aircraft or ground equipment.
          3.15.6.2.1. Locations that other wise authorize the use of prepackaged aerosol paint
          cans may use them on ground support equipment as long as they meet all mil-spec's
          requirements. The use of prepackaged aerosol paint cans is highly discouraged and all
          attempts to delete them from use must be made.
      3.15.6.3. Atomized spray, paint brushing, and rolling are authorized methods for paint
      application. Units limited by local environmental restrictions should maximize the use of
      brushing and rolling techniques. Coating film thickness must be carefully monitored
      when using these methods.
3.16. Aerospace Vehicles Marking Requirements.
   3.16.1. General. Paint schemes/configurations and USAF standard markings will be applied
   IAW T.O. 1-1-8 and the applicable aircraft technical orders. Attachment 1 contains specific
   locations/ instructions for applying PACAF approved USAF non-standard markings to
   PACAF aircraft. Aircraft Structural Maintenance will assist units with technical issues
   concerning aircraft markings.
   3.16.2. Structural Maintenance personnel are responsible for scoring aircraft paint systems
   and determining when to accomplish the scuff-sand and overcoat within the mid-life cycle.
   They will use a locally developed scoring system (or in accordance with technical data, if
   applicable) to determine priority for repaint. Repaint schedules will be established with
   consideration for PDM cycles, but coating condition, determined by Structural Maintenance
   technicians, will take precedence.
PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                              21


     3.16.2.1. (Added-35FW) Aircraft scoring will be accomplished after each aircraft wash
     and reviewed semi-annually. This is to ensure aircraft requiring corrosion attention are
     prioritized and scheduled accordingly within their mid-life cycle.
     3.16.2.2. (Added-35FW) All aircraft will be scored using the 35 MXS ASM section’s
     locally developed scoring sheet (attachment 1B). The Aircraft Paint Score will be
     updated and posted on the overall Misawa Fleet Condition status sheet on the 35 MXS Q
     drive and can be accessed through the following link: Q:\MXM\MXMF\Structural
     Mx\Paint Scores for MXM\Misawa Fleet Condition-working copy.xlsx
  3.16.3. All aircraft markings and basic paint schemes will be maintained intact and legible.
  Overcoating will be accomplished when necessary to restore protection to bare or eroded
  areas, extend coating service life, or when aircraft appearance is unacceptable (excessively
  faded or stained, etc.). Command standardization of markings is of primary concern. Fighter
  units may scuff sand and overcoat their aircraft every 24-48 months if needed to maintain
  coating system integrity and aircraft appearance. This 24-48 month overcoat is the
  approximate mid-life expectancy of present coating systems qualified for aircraft application.
  Aircraft scheduled for PDM within 24 months will not receive full repaint. Units are required
  to adopt maintenance-painting techniques (i.e., spot painting and sectionalized painting as
  stated in T.O. 1-1-8) to maintain aircraft corrosion protection and appearance between
  overcoats. Partial painting ―sections‖ of the aircraft will help reduce the effects of mottling
  and mismatch. Units will rotate Commander’s aircraft to prevent excessive paint build-up
  from too frequent overcoating. Specific tail numbers will not be permanently retained as
  flagships. Rotation will be planned and forecasted by the wing corrosion control manager and
  wing schedulers. Flagships will be converted utilizing the most effective means through
  programmed depot maintenance returns and already planned overcoats. Do not repaint
  aircraft solely to convert to flagship paint configuration. Fully overcoated aircraft will be
  documented in CAMS and the individual aircraft AFTO Form 95 for tracking purposes.
  When large portions of aircraft are repainted (i.e. full wing, large portions of fuselage, flight
  controls, etc.), the AFTO Form 95 will be annotated with type of paint and exact location.
  Large aircraft units should rely on spot maintenance painting and sectionalized painting
  between depot cycles to maintain the coating system integrity. Any changes in paint scheme
  required by this supplement should be deferred to the next scheduled full repaint.
     3.16.3.1. Aircraft paint data placards must not be permanently removed. When complete
     overcoats are accomplished, the paint data on the old placard will be annotated on the
     AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data. Field units that complete a scuff and
     overcoat will ensure a new placard is applied with new dates.
     3.16.3.2. Paint cure times are critical to the effectiveness of the final coating. Technical
     Order cure times must be allowed to expire before painted components are placed into
     service.
     3.16.3.3. External components (i.e. tanks, travel pods, pylons, etc.) shall be painted the
     same color and tone as the existing aircraft coating with no markings other than T.O.
     required. Flagships will not have specially marked tanks or travel pods.
     3.16.3.4. In the event detachable aircraft equipment (weapons stores, pylons, external
     fuel tanks, launchers, etc.) is governed by specific technical data for paint requirements,
22                                              PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


     the specific technical data will take precedence over general aircraft paint system
     requirements.
     3.16.3.5. IFR door numbers will be black in color.
     3.16.3.6. MAJCOM additional aircraft markings.
         3.16.3.6.1. F-15C/D use contrasting gray markings (medium gray color # 36251 on
         dark areas, and dark gray color # 36176 on medium areas). Black additional markings
         will be # 37038.
         3.16.3.6.2. F-16 use contrasting grays (gray background # 36270 will have gray
         markings # 36118, and gray background no. 36118 will have marking # 36270).
         Black additional markings will be # 37038.
         3.16.3.6.3. All other aircraft additional markings will be black # 37038 for flat paint
         coatings and 10738 for gloss paint coatings.
     3.16.3.7. Advance Protective Coating (APC) paint will be used as soon as it becomes
     available for each aircraft.
  3.16.4. Methods of Application. The following are approved methods for applying aircraft
  markings:
     3.16.4.1. Stenciling: refer to T.O. 1-1-8 and the applicable aircraft T.O. to determine the
     compatibility of stenciling paints, colors, and paint finishes.
     3.16.4.2. Silk-screen Printing. The silk-screen printing process is an approved method
     for applying insignia to aircraft.
         3.16.4.2.1. The silk-screen print method will not be used on aircraft surfaces that are
         contoured or have protruding screws, rivets, or bolts making use of rigid silk-screen
         frames impossible.
         3.16.4.2.2. When used, silk-screen printing kits will be procured using local purchase
         procedures (AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 2, Part 2) with organization and maintenance
         (O&M) funds – vendors can be identified by local contracting offices.
 3.16.5. Each Wing will send HQ PACAF/LGMFB high-resolution digital photographs
 displaying the entire left and right side of the NAF, Wing, OG, and flying squadron
 flagships. Additional, digital photographs displaying the entire left and right side of one non-
 flagship aircraft for each MDS is also required.
  3.16.6. Tail Stripe.
     3.16.6.1. Tail stripes are applied to identify aircraft operation squadrons. Each operations
     squadron tail stripe will be unique to that squadron. The use of the same tail stripe color
     by two or more squadrons within a wing is not permitted. The tail stripe will be applied at
     the upper portion of the vertical stabilizer, and must be in the form of a straight stripe.
     Lettering and/or logo are not authorized in the tail stripe. The width will be 6" on
     fighter/attack aircraft and as stated in Attachment 1 for all other. On aircraft with
     multiple vertical stabilizers, the tail stripe will be a wrap-around style on both vertical
     stabilizers. The paint must be a flat-based coating; no semi-gloss or gloss paint is
     authorized. The squadrons tail stripe colors and patterns are listed in Attachment 1.
PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                             23


  3.16.7. Aircrew and Crew Chief Names.
     3.16.7.1. Aircrew/crew chief personnel names will be applied as instructed in
     Attachment 1. Names applied to PACAF aircraft may use either their given name, go-by
     name, or nickname. If go-by name or nickname is used written WG/CC approval of the
     name is required. A copy of the WG/CC approval letter must be provided to the
     Corrosion shop prior to the name being applied on the aircraft. An individual’s first name
     can be either the given proper name (William, Robert, James, etc.) or the more familiar,
     shorter form of the proper name (Bill, Bob, Jim, etc.). The names will be 1-3/4 inch block
     style lettering for fighter/attack aircraft and helicopters. Heavy aircraft commander's and
     crew chief names will be 3-inch block style lettering. Painted or peel and stick lettering is
     acceptable; color will match the unit designator color. Designated commander's aircraft
     may have a different style of lettering but will maintain the designated lettering height.
     The title "Pilot", "WSO", DCC, or "ADCC" will not precede the aircrew and crew chief
     names. A ½ inch will separate DCC/ADCC name lines and Pilot/WSO name lines on
     fighter/attack aircraft. One inch will separate DCC/ADCC name lines on heavy aircraft.
     A background block, border, and/or design depicting the MDS (i.e. eagle head, falcon
     head, etc.) may be used to enclose aircrew/crew chief names. Descriptive, go-by
     names/nicknames/call signs like (Snake, Flash, Fish, etc.) will not be applied to PACAF
     aircraft.
         3.16.7.1.1. (Added-35FW) Aircrew and Crew Chief names will be Helvetica
         Medium Accent font, dark gray, MIL-C-36118 in color for standard aircraft. The
         NAF, Wing, OG, and flying squadron commander’s aircraft will be Brush Grip, gray
         MIL-C-36118 in color with white shadowing.
  3.16.8. Nose Art.
     3.16.8.1. For the purpose of clarification, ―nose art‖ will be the term used to identify
     specialized artwork applied to the forward area of the aircraft. Nose art is not authorized
     on PACAF aircraft unless directed by MAJCOM or higher authority.
     3.16.8.2. "Lets Roll" nose art is authorized on one aircraft per Wing to include static
     aircraft.
  3.16.9. Commanders’ Aircraft Markings
     3.16.9.1. Commanders’ aircraft referred to in this supplement are those designated as
     Numbered Air Force (NAF), Wing, OG, and flying squadron commanders’ aircraft. The
     NAF commander may select one wing within his or her respective command to have an
     aircraft specifically marked. It will be the only aircraft authorized so marked. Wing, OG,
     and flying squadron commanders are authorized only one aircraft each to be marked with
     commander-type markings. The following markings are authorized for use on
     commander aircraft:
     3.16.9.2. The NAF, Wing, OG, and squadron lead aircraft will have the unit designator,
     numerals, and AF, FW, WG, AW, OG, FS, RQS, or AS (as applicable) highlighted with a
     white or contrasting gray ¼, ½, 1, or 1-1/2-inch shadow on both sides of the vertical
     stabilizer (F-15, A/OA-10 aircraft: left and right outboard vertical stabilizer). The
     numerals will be the size depicted for the aircraft serial number in T.O. 1-1-8, applicable
     weapons system T.O., or as directed in Attachment 1. The AF, FW, WG, AW, OG, FS,
24                                                  PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


        RQS, or AS will be the same size as the numerals. It will be positioned below the unit
        designator in the space normally reserved for the aircraft serial number.
        3.16.9.3. The aircraft serial number will be 4-inches in height, and configured as
        depicted in T.O. 1-1-8 and repositioned as follows:
        3.16.9.4. F-16: centered on panel 4425 and 4426.
        3.16.9.5. F-15: centered on the bottom edge of the vertical stabilizer main box.
        3.16.9.6. H-60: aircraft serial number will remain in standard location. Squadron
        designator will conform to the contour of the tail rotor pylon and be centered between
        unit designator and aircraft serial number in 5-inch military block lettering (length forced
        to 68-percent).
        3.16.9.7. C-130: serial number will be placed as shown in T.O. 1-1-8, applicable aircraft
        technical drawings, -23, and Attachment 1 to this instruction.
        3.16.9.8. All other PACAF aircraft: centered on the vertical stabilizer below special
        markings.
        3.16.9.9. The NAF, Wing, and OG lead aircraft horizontal tail stripe on the vertical
        stabilizer will display all assigned squadron colors. The colors will be equally distributed
        with the assigned squadron color forward. The divisional slant of the colors will conform
        to the slant of the vertical stabilizer. In addition, insignia of all squadrons will be
        displayed. The additional insignia will be symmetrically positioned aft of the aircraft
        assigned squadron insignia. The NAF insignia will be located on the left side where the
        wing insignia is normally positioned. The wing insignia will be relocated aft of the NAF
        insignia.
     3.16.10. Victory Markings:
        3.16.10.1. Aircraft awarded a verified aerial victory are authorized to display a 6-inch
        green star with a 1/2 inch black border located just below and centered on the pilot’s
        name block. The type of aircraft shot down shall be stenciled inside the star in 1/2 inch
        white lettering. For aircraft with more than one aerial victory, a star is authorized for each
        aircraft shot down.
        3.16.10.2. Victory markings (i.e. bomb drops, bombing missions, radar kills, etc) may be
        temporarily applied at deployed locations with Deployment Commander's approval.
        These markings must be removed no later than 30 days upon returning to home station.
     3.16.11. Waivers/Changes:
        3.16.11.1. Requests for permanent waivers/changes to this supplement will be submitted
        through the OG/CC and MXG/CC recommended by the WG/CC and sent to the NAF/CC
        for review. If approved and recommended by the NAF/CC, the request will be forwarded
        to HQ PACAF/LG for review and coordination. PACAF/CC is the final approval
        authority for most permanent aircraft marking waivers/changes. If necessary, the waiver
        will be forwarded to HQ USAF for approval.
        3.16.11.2. Waivers will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
PACAFI21-105_35FWSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                           25


      3.16.11.3. Permanent waiver requests will include the present procedure/marking,
      description of the proposed change, justification for the proposed change, and two color
      photographs, one showing the present marking, and one digitally altered to show the
      requested change (color drawings may be substituted).
      3.16.11.4. Approved waivers/changes will be implemented to the next PACAFI 21-105
      re-write making the waiver obsolete.
      3.16.11.5. Photographs of approved paint waivers will be sent to PACAF/LGMFB
      within 30 days after the completion of the first aircraft being changed.
   3.16.12. Competition Aircraft.
      3.16.12.1. Units participating in competitions such as William Tell, Gunsmoke, Saber
      Spirit, etc., will follow the guidelines established in the competition rules for aircraft
      appearance. Competitions should be considered ―come as you are‖, and no waivers will
      be granted. ―Come as you are‖ is defined as no special effort, painting, or additional
      markings applied to enhance or improve the overall appearance of the aircraft. This
      includes polishing of titanium and using commander-type markings.
      3.16.12.2. When a unit wins one of the competitions listed above, the Wing Commander
      may authorize temporary marking additions to lead aircraft.
      3.16.12.3. If used, markings are to be displayed until the next competition winners are
      announced.
   3.16.13. Demo Aircraft.
      3.16.13.1. Demo aircraft will not have specially designed markings and "Lets Roll"
