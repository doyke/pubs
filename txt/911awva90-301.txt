                The Air Force has a well-established IG Complaints Program that allows you to
               obtain assistance quickly and fairly when you have a problem. The IG Complaints
               Program is addressed in AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints. This instruction
               informs you on procedures for filing a complaint. You may contact the IG at any
               level without notifying your chain of command. No one can prohibit your access to
               the IG. However, experience has demonstrated that commanders and supervisors
               can resolve complaints the best. For this reason, you are encouraged to discuss your
               problem with your supervisor or your commander before seeking assistance from
               the IG.
