SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction reflects the mission expansion of the AFISRA Special ISR Operations Cell
(SIOC) clarifying the incorporation of sensitive ISR capabilities into combatant commander
"Air, Space and Cyber operations." It also deletes management responsibilities for the Tactics
2                                                                           AFISRAI10-206 28 JUNE 2011


Analysis and Reporting Program (TARP) as directed by AFI 14-120, Tactics Analysis and
Reporting Program (program moved to AFISRA/A2).
1. Overview. This instruction provides a basic understanding of how the AFISRA SIOC will
provide ISR capabilities via the Integrated Joint Special Technical Operations (IJSTO) planning
and integration process to support sensitive Air, Space and Cyber Operations. The AFISRA
advocates and develops ISR competencies vital to sustaining full-spectrum Air, Space and Cyber
ISR capabilities for the war fighter and the nation. Also, the USAF has designated the
Commander, AFISRA as the Air Force Service Cryptologic Component (SCC). This unique mix
of responsibilities combines National Signals Intelligence capabilities with war fighting
authorities, facilitating sensitive ISR capabilities to be incorporated into Air, Space and Cyber
operations.
2. AFISRA Description. The mission of the AFISRA is to organize, train, equip, and present
assigned forces and capabilities to conduct ISR for combatant commanders and the nation. It is
responsible for implementing and overseeing execution of HQ USAF/A2 policy and guidance to
expand AF ISR capabilities to meet current and future challenges. Deconflicting, coordinating,
synchronizing, and integrating element activities with ISR Operations Courses of Action
(COAs), along with the deliberate planning, exercises and experiments are each considered
before a coordinated AFISRA response is developed. This synergy ensures the incorporation of
applicable ISR resources critical to successful Air, Space and Cyber operations.
3. Special ISR Operations Cell (SIOC) Description.
    3.1. AFISRA SIOC has been designated as a staff to coordinate, integrate, and synchronize
    sensitive ISR Planning and Integration (P&I) support to Air, Space and Cyber operations.
    The SIOC P&I process will adhere to the Joint Request and Approval Process (RAP).
    3.2. The SIOC is the AFISRA focal point for management and coordination of sensitive
    programs to include Focal Point, Special Technical Operations, COAL WARFIGHTER, as
    well as advocating the ISR requirements for Air, Space and Cyber Operations.
    3.3. The SIOC is the single AFISRA point of entry for IJSTO planning requests, sensitive
    ISR requirements, and provides coordination of critical ISR capabilities necessary for
    exercise, experiment, deliberate planning, and real world operations.
    3.4. The SIOC is responsible for providing comprehensive, coordinated ISR COAs from
    various AF and Joint elements to support Combatant Commanders' objectives. This includes
    sensitive ISR support recommendations and coordination/deconfliction with National-level,
    Joint and AF elements throughout the ISR enterprise.
    3.5. The SIOC is made up of action officers from the A3OW Cross Domain and STO flight
    in combination with action officers from across the AFISRA enterprise. These action
    officers will monitor operations, contingencies, and training for sensitive ISR requirements.
    The STO Chief will coordinate with Chief, Weapons and Tactics to assign appropriate action
    officers to work SIOC requirements. The SIOC acts as a focal point across the AFISRA
    Enterprise to work sensitive ISR issues for the AFISRA/CC and A3.
4. The Commander, AFISRA will:
AFISRAI10-206 28 JUNE 2011                                                                3


   4.1. Designate the AFISRA SIOC as the support staff and action office for all sensitive ISR
   issues and concerns that may impact or reflect on Air, Space and Cyber Operations forces,
   planning considerations or operations for the Focal Point, Coal Warfighter, or IJSTO process.
   4.2. Designate AFISRA/A3 as the lead to ensure effective ISR capabilities are provided to
   Air, Space and Cyber Operations.
5. AFISRA/A3 will:
   5.1. Ensure AFISRA supports plans (i.e., memorandum of agreements, instructions, etc.) in
   place and ensure agency resources are available to provide sensitive ISR solutions to
   combatant commander requirements that cannot be obtained from the national intelligence
   community.
   5.2. Represent the Commander, AFISRA during "Council-of-Colonels" Planning and
   Integration meetings, ensuring Evaluation Request Messages delineating Combatant
   Commander operational/ISR requirements are thoroughly reviewed and coordinated
   throughout the AFISRA Enterprise. The Council of Colonels is an A3-lead program,
   conducted via email, video teleconferencing (VTC), or in person, where AFISRA options are
   reviewed and vetted. Membership is fluid, based on subject, classification, and audience
   required. This process ensures potential COAs are comprehensive, presented in a timely
   manner, and are thoroughly coordinated and expedited through appropriate channels.
6. The SIOC will:
   6.1. Provide recommendations and advice on operational alternatives available from other
   AFISRA resources to include the AFISRA staff, National Air and Space Intelligence Center
   (NASIC), Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), 70th Intelligence, Surveillance
   and Reconnaissance Wing (ISRW), 480 ISRW, 361st Intelligence Surveillance and
   Reconnaissance Group (ISRG), and others as required.
   6.2. Coordinate with Combatant Commands, Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), and the
   Intelligence Community concerning any known operational ISR issues that relate to the
   planning, deconfliction, and cross coordination of support to ISR or Combat Air Force
   (CAF) operations.
   6.3. Identify and codify AFISRA requirements, legal opinions, intelligence support,
   innovative/developmental capabilities, and other AFISRA capabilities to best provide
   solutions to Combatant Commanders' requirements. In this role, the SIOC will consolidate
   inputs from AFISRA staff, AFTAC, NASIC, 70 ISRW, 480 ISRW, 361 ISRG, and others as
   required in a consolidated format and forward via the appropriate channels to applicable
   customer.
   6.4. Assemble representatives from the AFISRA Enterprise to review and help develop
   potential ISR Operations COAs and coordinate Combatant Commander ISR requests. Host
   the "Council of Colonels" when necessary, to review Combatant Commanders' needs and to
   coordinate ISR Operations responses. The Council will consist of O-6 representation from:
   the SIOC, AFISRA/A3, ISRW and ISRG staffs, AFTAC, NASIC, AFISRA staff elements
   and other subject matter experts as required. Representatives from NAFs or MAJCOMs (i.e.,
   24AF/ AF SPACECOM) are invited to attend the “Council of Colonels” when ISR support is
4                                                                        AFISRAI10-206 28 JUNE 2011


    required for their capabilities.      The Council will refine and codify proposed
    recommendations, providing a single response to sensitive ISR Operational requests.
    6.5. Provide ISR planning and integration updates to the Commander, AFISRA and his
    senior staff as required. These updates will ensure the Commander, AFISRA maintains
    access to, and is in direct communications with, AF elements performing ISR activities.
