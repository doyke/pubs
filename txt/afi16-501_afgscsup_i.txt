1. DoD PPBE Process.
     1.1. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Process. The PPBE
     system is the DoD resource management process with four interrelated phases consistent
     with national security objectives, policies, and strategies. Its purpose is to identify capability
     requirements (Planning), and match them with resource requirements (Programming),
     translate them into budget proposals (Budgeting), and evaluate spending (Execution) to
     determine how well the desired capabilities will be achieved. The Secretary of Defense
     (SECDEF) provides centralized policy direction throughout the four phases, while delegating
     program development, execution authority, and responsibility to Services and DoD agencies.
        1.1.1. MID 913 directed a significant change to the existing PPBS process. Beginning
        with the FY04 Program Objective Memorandum, Office of the Secretary of Defense
        (OSD) Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) implemented a 4-year process
        comprised of two 2-year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution cycles. The
        table below describes the details of each of the four years dealt with in 2-year cycles.

     Justification



   1.2. Planning. The first phase of the PPBE process, planning, begins as a DoD function. It
   is a vision of the future with broad strategies and plans. The planning phase encompasses
   long-range guidance out to 20-years, long-range objectives out to 10-years, and mid-term
   planning out to 6-years. Long-range guidance and objectives are generated to define the
   major force modernization and investment requirements for each DoD component. The
   Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) and the Joint Programming Guidance (JPG) have
   replaced the Defense Planning Guidance and guide the mid-term planning period. Both
   documents are published every other year, but the SPG may be published annually at the
   discretion of the SECDEF.
      1.2.1. The SPG is designed to provide focused, timely, strategic direction to resource
      allocation decisions of the DoD. The priorities in the SPG help provide the common
      analytical and programmatic course to build the joint capabilities needed to overcome the
      diverse challenges of the future.

       1.2.2. The JPG conveys the SECDEF’s decisions on issues developed through the
       Enhanced Planning Process (EPP) and on other matters of high priority. The guidance is
       fiscally constrained, executable, and mandatory. Implementation must be consistent with
       strategic direction and priorities set forth in the SPG.
    1.3. Programming. The second phase of the PPBE process, programming, applies
    constraints to the OSD vision developed in the planning phase. Programming is primarily a
    military department/agency function. Programming translates DoD guidance into action,
    balances allocation of resources to plans (requirements), organizes requirements into
    packages (programs), and prioritizes programs based on capabilities/risks.
       1.3.1. The Services’ Program Objective Memorandum (POM) is developed within the
       fiscal constraints set forth by the administration. These fiscal constraints guide the
       Services to make choices to meet the requirements of the SPG and JPG. The POM
       covers the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). In even-numbered years, the FYDP
       covers six years, as opposed to five years in odd-numbered years. Services then submit
       their POM to the OSD for review and compliance with directives and guidance.
       1.3.2. OSD Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) is responsible for the Program
       Review cycle and ensures the programs and corresponding resources are consistent with
       the objectives of the SECDEF and the President. PA&E issues Program Decision
       Memorandums (PDMs) to the Services highlighting OSD changes to any of the
       programs.
    1.4. Budgeting. The third phase of the PPBE process, budgeting, involves the formulation
    and control of near-term resource requirements, allocation, and use, based on the results of
    the planning and programming efforts. The budget is developed from the POM, as modified
    by the PDMs. The budget phase takes the first two resource years of the POM and prepares
    the requirements for presentation to OSD and Congress.
       1.4.1. Budget Review is OSD’s opportunity to ensure programs are correctly costed and
       dollars are budgeted against them within fiscal management rules and policies.
       1.4.2. OSD Comptroller (OSD (C)) is responsible for the Budget Review cycle and
       issues Program Budget Decisions (PBDs) highlighting proposed changes to the Services’
       budgets.
       1.4.3. In this process there is some opportunity for the programs to be adjusted to better
       meet capability requirements before submittal to Congress. Services may provide
       reclamas to draft PBDs, and signed PBDs that contain unacceptable issues and may be
       appealed with OSD via negotiation or may be designated major budget issues.
    1.5. Management Initiative Decision (MID) 913. MID 913 makes the Program Review
    and Budget Review concurrent under what is now called the Program Budget Review (PBR).
    Under MID 913, the PDM and PBD cycles both enact changes to Service’s POMs. The
    Budget Estimate Submission (BES) phase is no longer independent.
    1.6. Execution. The final phase of the PPBE process is the execution of the program-
    budget. Execution is the process by which the performance of the planning, programming,
    and budgeting phases are translated into warfighter capability. IAW MID 910, the
    effectiveness of the PPBE must be measured and validated with metrics.

2. Air Force PPBE Process.
2. (AFGSC)Air Force Planning, Programming, Budgeting & Execution (PPBE)
Process. The HQ AFGSC corporate structure provides a deliberate and iterative means of
developing the AFGSC Program Objective Memorandum (POM) submission for Commander
AFGSC (AFGSC/CC) approval. The success of the HQ AFGSC corporate process requires that
all participants take a ―corporate‖ approach to decisions that affect the entire command. Within
AFGSC, the goal of this process is to allocate AFGSC resources in support of USAF objectives
established by the SecAF and CSAF, as described in the Annual Planning and Programming
Guidance (APPG) and the budget. The AFGSC corporate structure (Fig. 1) plays an important
role in the PPBE process by providing guidance and management oversight for all activities
required to develop and integrate AFGSC issues. The primary elements of the AFGSC corporate
structure are the AFGSC Council, the AFGSC Board, the AFGSC Group, and the AFGSC
Panels.
   2.1. Goal. The goal of the Air Force PPBE process is to provide the best implementation
   and execution of the defense objectives in support of our national goals established by the
   President and captured by the SECDEF in the SPG/JPG and other guidance/documents.
   2.2. Headquarters Air Force Responsibilities:
       2.2.1. Prepares inputs for SPG/JPG. Develops and submits the Air Force POM to OSD.
       Develops and submits the Air Force PB to OSD and distributes program documents to the
       Programming Agencies.
       2.2.2. Implements OSD program directives and guidance during the PBR and ensures the
       OSD approved program is reflected in the FYDP.
       2.2.3. Ensures appropriate amendments to program guidance and directives are
       interpreted, implemented, and direction is provided to Programming Agencies.
       2.2.4. Makes necessary changes within the range of HQ USAF approval authority,
       funding, and manpower.
       2.2.5. Ensures requests for program changes initiated within HQ USAF or submitted by
       the Programming Agencies are processed IAW procedures defined in Attachment 3.
       2.2.6. Distributes Combatant Commander’s (COCOM) Integrated Priority Lists (IPL) to
       planning and programming agencies.
   2.3. Programming Agencies Responsibilities:
       2.3.1. Comply with program guidance issued by OSD and HQ USAF.
       2.3.2. Submit program data and briefings according to HQ USAF schedule and direction.
       2.3.3. Coordinate with the appropriate MAJCOM (see table below) to translate
       COCOM’s capability requirements into programmatic terms, to include program
       elements and required funding.

        results in their POM briefings to the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS).
        2.4.2. Coordinate with MAJCOMs to translate capability requirements               into
        programmatic terms, to include program elements and required funding.
        2.4.3. Use the vetting process to identify requirements more appropriately funded by
        another Service, and forward for inclusion in the other Service’s POM.
     2.5. Executive Agent Responsibilities.
        2.5.1. HAF and programming agencies will meet the requirements of the agencies and
        programs where the Air Force is identified as the Executive Agent. This responsibility

  3.1. Overview. The Air Force implements the PPBE process through the AFCS. The
  strength of the AFCS (see Figure 1) is the consistency of reviews tied to successive
  evaluation by grade level and experience within the functional staff (i.e. SAF/FM, AF/A3,
  AF/A4, etc.). It is not intended to supplant the functional staff but to enhance it and provide
  balance when making resource allocation decisions. The functional staff continues to
  conduct its functional business and reviews. The AFCS increases overall management
  effectiveness by applying cross-functional judgment, experience, and analysis to program
  adjustments in a resource limited environment.
  3.1. (AFGSC) Overview. AFGSC will employ a corporate approach to the PPBE process.
  The AFGSC corporate structure (Fig. 1) provides the command with cross-functional
  decision-making bodies that can address issues requiring consolidated command positions.
  The AFGSC corporate structure is focused on resource allocation issues--providing guidance;
  reviewing, prioritizing, consolidating and approving proposals; and directing HQ AFGSC
  PPBE activities. The Director of Plans, Programs and Requirements (AFGSC A5/8) has
  overall responsibility for the AFGSC corporate structure. The Comptroller (AFGSC/FM) has
  overall responsibility for budgeting and execution. AFGSC/CC is the final approving
  authority for all PPBE actions. Decisions requiring an official AFGSC position often have
  short suspenses affecting the command. In this regard, the AFGSC corporate structure may
  be required to convene and deliberate on very short notice. In some short notice cases, the
  AFGSC corporate structure can be held via email or the A5/8 can be the final decision
  maker. AFGSC corporate structure duties take precedence over all other routine staff
  functions. It is critical to the corporate decision-making process that all directorates provide
  appropriate representation at each level. The intent is to create an effective decision-making
  process supported by individuals knowledgeable of AFGSC requirements, plans, programs,
  and budgets; aware of directorate concerns; and able to assess issues from a corporate Air
  Force perspective.
     3.1.1. The AFCS enables Air Force transformation by supporting a capabilities-based
     resource allocation program. The AFCS presents the best courses of action to the
     Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) for
     making resource-based decisions. The top-down deliberative elements of the AFCS are
     the Air Force Council (AFC), the Air Force Board (AFB), the Air Force Group (AFG),
     and the 13 Mission and Mission Support Panels. The AFCS is guided by the Air Force
     Concepts of Operations (AF CONOPS) (Global Mobility, Global Persistent Attack,
     Global Strike, Homeland Security, Nuclear Response, Space and Command, Control,
     Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR),
     and Agile Combat Support) and the Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA)
     process informs investment decisions and the development of the Air Force POM.
     3.1.2. The ultimate goals of the AFCS are to: provide a multifunctional, cross-staff
     perspective on all key Air Force programs; enhance responsiveness to program issues;
     support corporate decision-making through interaction with Mission/Mission Support
     Panels; and cut across organizational barriers to improve the corporate decision-making
     process.
     3.1.3. Process Timing is on a calendar year schedule. Refer to Air Force POM
     Preparation Instruction (PPI) and DoD Instruction 7045.7 for calendar of events.

     3.2. Air Force Council (AFC). The AFC is the senior forum for cross-functional
     consideration of the most critical Air Force issues. The AFC reviews and evaluates Air
     Force objectives, policies, plans, programs, budgets, and studies to make timely
     recommendations to the SECAF and CSAF. The AFC also provides expeditious Deputy
     Chiefs of Staff (DCS)-level coordination on significant, urgent, and complex issues to ensure
     that Air Force plans, polices, and programs comply with Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), OSD,
     and national objectives. The AFC returns issues to the Air Force Board (AFB) for further
     study. The AFC is chaired by the AF/CV, and membership consists of Air Staff and
     Secretariat Principals (3-star and civilian equivalent with some selected 2-star members).
     3.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC Council. The AFGSC Council (Fig. 2) is the senior body in the
     AFGSC corporate structure; it provides executive-level review and direction for resource
     allocation. The Council meets to review and approve proposed AFGSC plans, programs,
     budgets, and staff actions requiring additional resources prior to submission to AFGSC/CC
     for approval. AFGSC Council approval may be used in lieu of formal topline coordination
     for certain streamlined staff actions as directed by the AFGSC Vice Commander (CV).

       oversight of resource allocation, management, security, and execution of all Air Force
       special access programs (SAPs), excluding the National Foreign Intelligence Program.
       The SPOC is chaired by the SECAF (see Figure 1).
       3.2.1. (AFGSC) Council Membership. The Council is chaired by the AFGSC/CV.
       Council members will consist of the Commander, Eighth Air Force (8AF/CC);
       Commander, Twentieth Air Force (20AF/CC); Manpower, Personnel and Services
       (AFGSC/A1); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AFGSC/A2); Operations
       (AFGSC/A3); Logistics, Installations and Mission Support (AFGSC/A4/7); Plans,
       Programs, and Requirements (AFGSC/A5/8); Communications and Information
       (AFGSC/A6); Analyses, Assessments and Lessons Learned (AFGSC/A9); Financial
       Management (AFGSC/FM); Inspector General (AFGSC/IG); Command Surgeon
       (AFGSC/SG); Public Affairs (AFGSC/PA); Judge Advocate (AFGSC/JA); Chaplain
       (AFGSC/HC); Legislative Liaison (AFGSC/LL); Chief Scientist (AFGSC/ST); and

     Safety (AFGSC/SE). Additional members and advisors will be appointed at the
     discretion of the Council Chair.
     3.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Each Council member will designate a representative (and
     alternate) to serve as a ―primary‖ AFGSC Board member. AFGSC/A8PE will maintain a
     consolidated list of Board members.

Figure 2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Council.




  3.3. Air Force Board (AFB). The AFB provides flag-level (1-2 star and civilian
  equivalent) review, evaluation, and recommendations within the same broad categories as the
  AFC. Members are selected by their AFC counterpart and are responsible for preparing their
  principal for AFC meetings. Additional members of the AFB are advisory and represent
  programs with Air Force Total Obligation Authority (TOA) and a combination of unique
  functional expertise. Additionally, panel chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are present,
  each representing mission and functional areas of Air Force expertise. Topics should be
  limited to important matters requiring corporate consideration and resolution. Its ultimate
  strength lies in its broad representative span that allows thorough vetting of issues before
  elevating the most critical issues to the AFC. Additionally, the AFB directs the focus of the
  AFG in resolving issues, refines AFG developed recommendations for submission to the
  AFC, and expedites Directorate-level coordination on significant issues. The AFB is chaired
  by Director of Programs, HQ USAF/A8P, with the Associate Director as his back up, and co-
  chaired by Deputy Assistant Secretary (Financial Management) (SAF/FMB), on non-budget
  issues. During budget formulation and execution, and during the Budget Review cycle, it is
  chaired by SAF/FMB.
  Board membership includes representatives from:
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                         11


  HQ USAF: A1 | A2 | A3/5 | A4/7 | A8 | A9 | HC | JA | RE | SG | TE
  SAF: AA | AG | AQ | FM | GC | IA | IE | IG | LL | PA | XC | USA | ANG
  Advisory members include: AF/A1M | AF/A7C | AF/A8X
  3.3. (AFGSC) AFGSC Board. The AFGSC Board (Fig. 3) provides directorate-level
  review and evaluation of recommendations presented by the AFGSC Group. In doing so, the
  Board seeks to narrow the scope of issues to those which require Council-level review and/or
  cannot be resolved at lower levels of the CS. Issues presented to the Council will be
  accompanied by viable Courses of Action (COAs) for consideration. The Board Chair will
  present POM position recommendations and outlying issues to the AFGSC Council.
     3.3.1. The Investment Budget Review Committee (IBRC) chaired by SAF/FMBI
     (General Officer equivalent), assists the AFC/AFB in evaluating investment
     appropriations and accounts in the year of execution, while the Operating Budget Review
     Committee (OBRC) chaired by SAF/FMBO (General Officer equivalent) assists in
     evaluating the program budgeting and execution of the Operations and Maintenance
     (O&M) appropriation in the year of execution (see Figure 1).
     3.3.1. (AFGSC) Board Membership. The Board is chaired by the AFGSC A5/8 for
     planning and programming activities or FM for budgeting and execution activities.
     Board members will consist of the Eighth Air Force Vice-Commander (8AF/CV);
     Twentieth Air Force Vice-Commander (20AF/CV); and Deputy Directors from
     Manpower, Personnel and Services (AFGSC/DA1); Intelligence, Surveillance, and
     Reconnaissance (AFGSC/DA2); Operations (AFGSC/DA3); Logistics, Installations and
     Mission Support (AFGSC/DA4 & DA7); Plans, Programs, and Requirements
     (AFGSC/DA5/8); Communications and Information (AFGSC/DA6); Analyses,
     Assessments and Lessons Learned (AFGSC/DA9); Financial Management
     (AFGSC/DFM); Inspector General (AFGSC/DIG); Command Surgeon (AFGSC/SG2);
     Public Affairs (AFGSC/DPA); Staff Judge Advocate (AFGSC/DSJA); Command
     Chaplain (AFGSC/DHC); Safety (AFGSC/DSE); Science (AFGSC/STN); and
     Legislative Liaison (AFGSC/LL). Additional members and advisors will be appointed at
     the discretion of the Board Chair.
     3.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Each primary Board member will designate a representative,
     and alternate, to serve as AFGSC Group members. Directorates may appoint a
     representative, and alternate, from each of their organizational divisions.
12                                             AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


Figure 3. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Board.




     3.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Combined Group/Board. A combined Group/Board serves as
     an option to the decision- making body for time critical and out-of-cycle issues. The
     process owner publishes and distributes an agenda, rules of engagement and read-ahead
     slides at least one hour prior to each combined Group/Board, if possible. Recommended
     courses of action from a combined Group/Board are submitted to the AFGSC/CV and
     forwarded to the AFGSC/CC for approval as necessary. Use of this form of the corporate
     structure should be kept to a minimum and only used when task completion timelines are
     so short that having a Group followed by a Board is not feasible (e.g., Program Budget
     Decision and Resource Management Decision review).
  3.4. Air Force Group (AFG). The AFG provides the AFB and senior-level leadership (O-6
  and civilian equivalents) a forum for initial corporate review and evaluation on appropriate
  issues within the same broad categories as both the AFB and AFC. The AFG is the first level
  of the AFCS that integrates the Air Force mission, mission support areas, and capabilities
  into a balanced Air Force program. Members are selected by their AFB counterpart or two-
  letter sponsors and are responsible for preparing their principal for AFB or AFC meetings.
  Its ultimate strength lies in its broad representative span that allows thorough vetting of
  issues before being elevated to the AFB or AFC for review and deliberation. Like the AFB
  and AFC, the AFG provides a forum for expeditious Division-level coordination on
  significant issues.
  3.4. (AFGSC) AFGSC Group. The AFGSC Group (Fig. 4) provides senior-level (Colonel
  and civilian equivalent) oversight and direction for resource allocation. The AFGSC Group
  is the first level of the corporate structure that integrates issues across the command. The
  Group oversees major exercises that shape the Future Years’ Defense Program (FYDP)
  AFGSC Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Program Change Requests (PCR),
  Resource Management Decisions (RMD) as well as AFGSC budgeting and execution
  Program Budget Reviews (PBR), Budget Change Proposals (BCP), Financial Plans
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                              13


  (FinPlan), and AFGSC Initial Distribution and Budget Execution Reviews (BER). The
  AFGSC Group reviews, deliberates, and recommends positions to the AFGSC Board on
  issues submitted for consideration by AFGSC Panels.
     3.4.1. The AFG is chaired by AF/A8P Deputy except for purposes of budget formulation
     and execution to include the Budget Estimate Submission (BES), Budget Review (BR),
     and the President’s Budget (PB) when it is chaired by SAF/FMBP. Additionally, Panel
     Chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are present during AFG meetings. Panel briefs to
     the AFG require minimum of four briefer support chairs (POC + 3 AOs).
     AFG include representatives from:
     HQ USAF: A1 | A1M | A1S | A2 | A3/5 | A3O | A3S | A4P | A7C | A7S | A8F | A8P |
     A8X | A9R | HC | JA | RE | SG | TE
     SAF: AA | AG | AQ | FM | FMC | GC | IA | IE | IG | LL | PA | USA | ANG | XC
     3.4.1. (AFGSC) The Group reviews plans, programs, and budgets; and recommends
     positions to the AFGSC Board regarding resource allocation and staff actions that require
     additional resources. The AFGSC Group establishes policy and provides guidance to the
     AFGSC Panels. AFGSC Group approval may be used in lieu of formal bottomline
     coordination for certain streamlined staff actions as requested by a sponsoring AFGSC
     director. The AFGSC Group chairman presents the integrated program and budget issues
     to the AFGSC Board for approval.
     3.4.2. The five Mission and nine Mission Support Panels are the Air Force centers of
     expertise for their areas, and they are the first level of corporate deliberation in the AFCS.
     The Panels serve as the initial point of entry for issues arising from the Program Element
     Monitors (PEMs), Integrated Process Team (IPT), MAJCOMS, FOAs, or DRUs that
     require AFCS review. Panels review and develop options for presentation to the AFG.
     3.4.2. (AFGSC) Group Membership. The Group is chaired by the AFGSC A8P for
     planning and programming activities or FMA for budgeting and execution activities.
     AFGSC Group members will consist of Division Chiefs from Manpower, Personnel and
     Services (AFGSC/A1M); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Strategy and
     Plans (AFGSC/A2X); ICBM Operations (AFGSC/A3I); Bomber Operations
     (AFGSC/A3B); Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (AFGSC/A3Y);
     Integration and Resources (AFGSC/A4/7I); Capabilities, Requirements, Plans, and
     Programs (AFGSC/A5C/A5R/A8X); Communications and Information (AFGSC/A6X);
     Analyses and Assessments (AFGSC/A9A); Financial Anaylsis (AFGSC/FMA); Inspector
     General (AFGSC/IGI); Medical Support (AFGSC/SGA); Public Affairs Resources and
     Plans (AFGSC/PAX); Judge Advocate Civil Law (AFGSC/JAC); Legislative Liaison
     (AFGSC/LL); Aviation Safety (AFGSC/SEF); and Command Chaplain (AFGSC/HCP).
        3.4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Advisors may be appointed to the AFGSC Group at the
        discretion of the Group Chair. Advisors are appropriate Colonel (or civilian
        equivalent) stakeholders within and outside AFGSC that may provide specific subject
        matter expertise on issues relating to AFGSC plans and programs. AFGSC Group
        advisors may consist of AFMC/NWC ICBM Systems Division, AFMC A8P, and
        HAF/A10-R. Additionally, 8 AF/CV and 20 AF/CV may appoint advisor Group
        members (as required).

Figure 4. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Group.




     3.4.3. The Special Programs Review Group (SPRG) serves as the working-level advisory
     panel responsible for integration of requirements and allocation of resources across the
     SAP portfolio.      The SPRG matches resources to requirements and makes
     recommendations to the SPOC Executive Secretary for presentation to the SPOC. The
     SPRG is chaired by SAF/AQL and co-chaired by AF/A8PE (see Figure 1).
     3.4.4. In addition to permanent SAF/FMB representation on each mission and mission
     support panel, the AFCS requires SAF/FMB appropriations manager coordination on
     each approved Disconnect (D), Initiative (I), or Offset (O). Appropriation manager
     cooperation at the panel level ensures proper budget level detail review and develops
     information requirements for the creation of J-Book submissions. An established
     working relationship between the panels and the appropriation managers ensures funding
     ramps are avoided when possible and explained to the proper level of fidelity, when
     required for mission needs. This relationship also protects AFCS intent when last
     minute, undistributed cuts emerge during the fall review. Appropriation managers, with
     the help of the panels, can assist in the distribution and programmatic assessment on non-
     programmatic cuts. Panel Chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are members of the IBRC
     and OBRC processes, as well.
  3.5. AF Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Champions. The AF CONOPS Champions
  assess the portfolio of Air Force through the Integrated Capabilities Review and Risk
  Assessments (CRRA) process and evaluate the risk of Panel proposals and issues to the
  execution of the AF CONOPS. Together, the Panels and AF CONOPS Champions represent
  a body of highly qualified experts in program portfolios that align with capability
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                         15


  requirements defined by the AF CONOPS and capability objectives identified through the
  CRRA process. The Panel structure and organizational chairmanship is as follows:

   Competitive Sourcing and Privatization      HQ USAF/A1MS
   Innovation                                  SAF/XCOI



NOTE: Special Access Required (SAR) panel, AF/A8PE-SAR, serves as the SPRG
representative to the AF Board and Air Force Group (see Figure 1).
  3.5. (AFGSC) AFGSC Panels. The AFGSC Panels develop program issues for
  consideration by the AFGSC Group. Currently AFGSC has two Panels: Strategic Forces
  (Fig. 5) and Mission Support (Fig. 6). AFGSC Panels are centers of excellence for their
  mission/mission support areas of responsibility. The Programs Division (HQ AFGSC/A8P)
  provides Panel chairs and direct support to the Panels which are comprised of AFGSC action
  officers from across the staff. The primary purpose of the Panels is to support AFGSC
  resource allocation decision-making and to serve as the point of entry for issues requiring
  AFGSC corporate structure review and approval. Panels facilitate review and discussion of
  AFGSC programs and issues concerning research, development, test, procurement, force
  structure, operations, maintenance, training, military construction, information technology,
  manpower, and sustainment. Panels analyze issues, develop tradeoffs among programs, and
  in coordination with AFGSC/A8P, identify initiative, disconnect, and offset options for the
  AFGSC Group. Other Panels can be created and added as directed by the AFGSC Group
  Chair.
     3.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC             Panel    Membership. The        Panels include
     representatives from all appropriate functional staff elements as designated by the
     AFGSC Group chair. They are comprised of core members from HQ AFGSC
     directorates and agencies and advisors from the AFGSC staff, as required.
 16                                           AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


      3.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Strategic Forces Panel. The Strategic Forces Panel Chair will
      be the senior ranking Branch Chief of either AFGSC/A8PA or A8PI. The Strategic
      Forces portfolio includes all AFGSC programs that fall under the Nuclear Deterrence
      Operations and Cyber Superiority & C2 Mission Panels at HQ USAF. Members will
      consist of subject matter experts from Manpower Requirements (AFGSC/A1M);
      Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Strategy and Plans (AFGSC/A2X); ICBM
      Operations (AFGSC/A3I); Bomber Operations (AFGSC/A3B); Nuclear Command,
      Control and Communications (AFGSC/A3Y); Integration and Resources
      (AFGSC/A4/7I);        Capabilities  (AFGSC/A5C);        Requirements   (AFGSC/A5R);
      Communications and Information (AFGSC/A6X); Strategy (AFGSC/A8X); Analyses
      and Assessments (AFGSC/A9A); and Financial Anaylsis (AFGSC/FMA).
      3.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) Advisors may be appointed to the Strategic Forces Panel at the
      discretion of the Panel Chair. Advisors are appropriate stakeholders within and outside
      AFGSC that may provide specific subject-matter expertise on issues relating to AFGSC
      plans and programs. Strategic Forces Panel advisors may consist of the AFGSC/SGA,
      AFGSC/SEF, and AFNWC.

Figure 5. (Added-AFGSC) Strategic Forces Panel.




      3.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) Mission Support Panel. The Mission Support Panel Chair is
      the Branch Chief of AFGSC A8PM. The Mission Support portfolio includes all AFGSC
      programs that fall under the Logistics, Installation Support, Communications and
      Information, and Personnel and Training Mission/Mission Support Panels at HQ USAF.
      Members will consist of subject matter experts from Manpower Requirements
      (AFGSC/A1M); ICBM Operations (AFGSC/A3I); Bomber Operations (AFGSC/A3B);
      Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (AFGSC/A3Y); Integration and
      Resources (AFGSC/A4/7I); Capabilities (AFGSC/A5C); Requirements (AFGSC/A5R);
      Communications and Information (AFGSC/A6X); Civil Engineer Assets Management

      (AFGSC/A7A); Civil Engineer Operations (AFGSC/A7O); Strategy (AFGSC/A8X);
      Analyses and Assessments (AFGSC/A9A); and Financial Anaylsis (AFGSC/FMA).
      3.5.5. (Added-AFGSC) Advisors may be appointed to the Mission Support Panel at the
      discretion of the Panel Chair. Advisors are appropriate stakeholders within and outside
      AFGSC that may provide specific subject matter expertise on issues relating to AFGSC
      plans and programs. Mission Support Panel advisors may consist of the AFGSC/SGA2,
      AFGSC/IGI, AFGSC/SEF, and AFGSC/A2X.

Figure 6. (Added-AFGSC) Mission Support Panel.




   3.6. Program Element (PE). Each Air Force PE is assigned a single PEM to act as the focal
   point for that PE. A PEM is usually assigned from within the Secretariat or Air Staff, based
   on the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for that PE. HQ AF/A8PE is the approval
   authority and the AF point of contact for all PE actions. PE documentation is maintained in
   the AF FYDP Structure Management System (AF FSMS). PEMs establish accounts in this
   web based system and are the AF POC for all PE actions. PEMs are primary advocates for
   their PEs, addressing issues and coordinating functional concerns across various staffs. Air
   Staff PEMs are expected to be the subject matter expert at the Air Staff level on their PEs. In
   conjunction with the Mission/Mission Support Panels, they prepare and update various
   planning, programming, and budgeting documents within the PPBE process.
   3.6. (AFGSC) AFGSC Program Element Monitor (PEM). The PEM is an expert on all
   programmatic aspects of the programs he/she is assigned. Every AFGSC program is
   assigned to a PEM (primary and alternate) within the HQ AFGSC directorate with primary
   responsibility for monitoring and/or managing the program. Programs are commonly
   referred to by their title/description, Program Element (PE) identifier. AFGSC/A8PE
   maintains a roster of AFGSC programs, assigned PEMs, and alternate PEMs.
 18                                            AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


      3.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) PEM Duties. PEMs must be familiar with PPBE concepts,
      processes, and resources (e.g. RAPIDS/ABIDES). PEMs must develop and maintain an
      in-depth knowledge of past, present, and future funding profiles, technical content, and
      scheduling for those elements. PEMs are responsible for preparing various products
      pertaining to their assigned programs and presenting concise, fact-based information to
      the AFGSC Panels during initial information gathering deliberations which are
      commonly referred to as ―PEM Parades.‖ AFGSC/A8P will publish the PEM Parade
      schedule. All AFGSC programs which require funding in the Future Years’ Defense Plan
      (FYDP) will be addressed by the CS. PEM ―products‖ include, but are not limited to:
      RAPIDS slides, background papers, Program Option Summaries (Blue Sheets) and
      comprehensive       briefings    which    include    detailed    breakouts     of     all
      appropriations/requirements, production schedules, system or modification costs,
      capabilities and beddown requirements, impacts on other programs and other pertinent
      POM       related     information.       PEMs      will     coordinate    with     other
      MAJCOMs/directorates/agencies (as needed) to ensure program related impacts are
      identified and accurately relayed to the CS. For example, programs with a manpower
      impact will have AFGSC/A1M, AF/A1X, and appropriate AF Panel coordination; cost
      data will have AFGSC/FMA coordination; and programs with an operational need or
      requirement impact will have AFGSC/A5R and appropriate AF Panel coordination.
      3.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) File Plan. At a minimum, PEMs will maintain a classified file
      plan and Program-Of-Record (POR) information for the PEs within their program
      portfolio. The file plan must contain background papers, issue slides, RAPIDS ―Perfect‖
      slides with notes, funding obligation/execution rates, and ABIDES data as well as other
      information deemed pertinent. During POM related deliberations, PEMs will be given
      short suspenses to produce accurate data pertaining to their assigned programs.
      3.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) PEM Training. PEMs must be familiar with the PPBE
      system. Formal HAF-level PPBE training is available through HAF/A8P (see HAF/A8
      AF portal site). AFGSC/A8P conducts ―in-house‖ training/products on PPBE and
      AFGSC PEM responsibilities as a supplement to or in lieu of the formal HAF training.
4. Documentation.
   4.1. Force and Financial Plan (F&FP). The USAF F&FP system fuses with the ABIDES
   database interactive tool to develop and submit the Air Force FYDP to OSD. It contains
   information on resources such as military and civilian manpower, flying hours, aircraft
   authorizations, and inventory and procurement quantities, as well as dollars. The F&FP
   provides considerable expansion of details over the FYDP for Air Force programs.
   Modifications to the Air Force Program after submission to OSD require prior approval from
   OSD, and are implemented only with specific direction from HQ USAF. Requests to modify
   the Air Force Program should refer to the F&FP and its resources data.
   4.2. Program. The Air Force disseminates the Program through program documents. The
   principal program documents and the supplementary program documents list particular
   resource commodities of the overall programs and their OPRs (see Attachment 2).
   Responsible HQ USAF organizations publish the principal program documents after the PB
   submission. They may also publish these documents after a significant amended budget
   submission or any time OSD directs an additional update. These program documents are
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                         19


  categorized by PE (where appropriate), consistent with the USAF F&FP, and are
  implemented only with specific and separate authority from HQ USAF.
  4.3. Program Change Requests (PCRs). PCRs are used to request an operational or fiscal
  change outside the normal PPBE cycle that is mission critical to accomplish in the execution
  or budget years. Changes to the Air Force Program after execution and budget years will be
  part of Program Agency initiatives or disconnects during the next POM programming phase.
  General guidelines for Air Force PCRs are outlined in Attachment 3.
  4.3. (AFGSC) Program Change Request (PCR). Within AFGSC, all PCRs will be
  accomplished IAW AFI16-501. AFGSC/A8P has overall responsibility for the PCR process
  within AFGSC. AFGSC/CC is the final approval authority for all PCRs. AFGSC/A8PE
  assigns PCR numbers and maintains a log of PCRs and their status. AFGSC/A8 is the
  assigning authority for PCR offices of primary responsibility (OPR). AFGSC/A8P OPRs
  will work closely with HQ AFGSC PEMs, HAF, and other affected NAF staffs to develop,
  refine, and facilitate approval of AFGSC PCRs.
     4.3.1. PCRs are submitted as fully funded or as no cost. Reprogramming is necessary if
     a PCR directs the transfer of funds between appropriations rather than absorbing the cost
     within an appropriation. If the cost of the PCR is absorbed within the appropriation,
     reprogramming is still required when moving funds between program elements.
     Examples are transferring Air Force O&M to Air National Guard O&M, or using
     procurement funds to pay an O&M bill. When this occurs in the current year, HQ USAF,
     OSD, and congressional approvals are required to support the reprogramming (use of
     funds in other than original appropriation submitted to and enacted by Congress). The
     effective implementation date of PCR actions will be delayed until approved by OSD and
     Congress. Failure to do so may result in an Anti-Deficiency Act Violation (DoD
     7000.14R, Vol. 14, Administrative Control of Appropriations and Anti-Deficiency Act
     Violations). When a PCR realigns funds between appropriations for the budget years,
     prior approval from HQ USAF and OSD is required.
     4.3.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC PCRs may be developed in response to needs identified by Air
     Staff or within the AFGSC staff. The first step in the PCR process is to verify the
     identified need within the staff and determine specific goals of the proposed PCR. If a
     functional office identified the need for the PCR, that office contacts the appropriate
     AFGSC/A8P OPR. The OPR and functional office then develop options to meet the
     goals of the proposed PCR. (NOTE: In some circumstances, the AFGSC/A8P OPR will
     initiate the PCR and develop the options). The AFGSC/A8P OPR will coordinate with
     other AFGSC staff agencies as appropriate to assess aircraft availability, manpower
     availability, facility impacts, training requirements, and support equipment to determine
     how the goals can be met. The AFGSC/A8P OPR will work with the AFGSC staff to
     price options, identify offsets, and develop a recommendation. The AFGSC/A8P OPR
     will initiate staff coordination within AFGSC and with other affected NAFs and the Air
     Staff. AFGSC/A8P OPR may be required to brief the PCR to the AFGSC Group, Board
     or Council for approval.
     4.3.2. Requests for reprogramming/realignment to fund a PCR are not automatically
     approved. Reprogramming within or between appropriations, within or over dollar
     thresholds, or involving Congressional special interest line items all require special
20                                            AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


     oversight. HQ USAF, OSD, or Congress can deny the reprogramming/realignment
     actions. MAJCOMs must weigh the risk associated with identifying sources to offset a
     program change with the benefit of implementing the PCR outside of the programming or
     budgeting cycle. There is less risk when the PCR is sourced within the same
     appropriation.
     4.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) AFI 32-7061 and Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part
     989 (32 CFR Part 989) requires AFGSC to initiate an environmental analysis prior to
     submitting a PCR to HQ USAF. The requesting office should submit an AF Form 813,
     Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, with the PCR.                   NOTE: An
     environmental analysis is required any time there is an anticipated movement or change
     of aircraft, mission, or personnel assignment. For assistance in completing AF Form 813,
     contact HQ AFGSC/A7.
     4.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) The AFGSC/A8P OPR, with help from the functional
     community, will build and coordinate the PCR package. This package will include the
     proposed PCR message and other supporting documentation as required. When the PCR
     package is built, the OPR will coordinate (bottomline and topline) the PCR package with
     all affected AFGSC staff agencies/organizations, any other affected MAJCOMs, and
     NAFs. After coordination is complete, AFGSC/A8P will forward the PCR package to
     AFGSC/CC for approval. Upon approval, AFGSC/A8P will forward the PCR message to
     AF/A8P for initiation of the Air Staff approval process. AFGSC staff agencies will
     immediately notify AFGSC/A8P of any actions that may affect the PCR.
     4.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) The AFGSC/A8P OPR will assist AF/A8 action officers
     throughout the Air Staff PCR coordination/approval process and will monitor the status
     of the PCR until receipt of the AF/A8 PCR approval or disapproval message. Upon
     official notification of CSAF/SecAF approval of the PCR (via AF/A8 PCR approval
     message), the AFGSC OPR will initiate/monitor implementation of the PCR.
  4.4. DoD and USAF Program Document Processing and Distribution:
     4.4.1. Program Elements are primary data elements in the FYDP. They are organized
     into 11 Major Force Programs (MFP)--6 combat force oriented programs, and 5 support
     programs. The AFCS assigns PEs to IPTs and Panels according to their force structure or
     support function. Since some PEs may affect more than one Panel, cross-Panel
     coordination is an absolute requirement. The functional DCS, or the Secretariat
     equivalent functional manager, will coordinate assignment changes to existing PEs for
     approval by SECAF. PE directives are located at Attachment 7.
     4.4.2. PPBE documents and supporting databases are not disclosed outside DoD or other
     governmental agencies (e.g., OMB) not directly involved in the defense planning and
     resource allocation process. The OSD office responsible for the PPBE phase to which
     the document or database pertains will consider requests for exceptions on a case-by-case
     basis. The responsible offices are as follows: Under Secretary of Defense (Policy) for
     the Planning phase, the Under Secretary of Defense, (Program Analysis and Evaluation)
     for the Programming phase, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) for the
     Budgeting phase [see DoD Instruction 7045.7]. The responsible OSD office coordinates
     and approves requests with the General Counsel.
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                              21


     4.4.3. The Air Force, by request, distributes SECAF and CSAF approved PPBE
     documents and decisions to OSD and headquarters elements of the Departments of the
     Army and the Navy. Sub-elements of those departments that require information on Air
     Force programs should get it from their respective departmental headquarters. The Air
     Force distributes program documents internally on a strict "need-to-know" basis (see
     DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regulation, January 1997, and AFPD 31-
     4, Information Security, 1 September 1998).
     4.4.4. HQ USAF distributes program documents to directorates through Programming
     Agencies. With specific, fully justified requests from the Programming Agencies, HQ
     USAF may distribute documents directly to the subordinate commands immediately
     below MAJCOM level.
         4.4.4.1. HQ USAF/A8 controls the distribution for the principal program documents;
         the OPRs control supplementary documents (see Attachment 2).
         4.4.4.2. Send all requests for program documents through the Programming Agencies
         to the HQ USAF OPR. Do not use normal publications channels. Requests for new
         or increased distribution must:
             4.4.4.2.1. Be signed at the command’s directorate level.
             4.4.4.2.2. Identify the using agency.
             4.4.4.2.3. Justify the reason for the request.
             4.4.4.2.4. Identify the total number now being received in the command’s
             headquarters.
             4.4.4.2.5. Identify the Programming Agency’s focal point responsible for
             program document control.
             4.4.4.2.6. In determining total requirements, Programming Agencies should use
             focal points or classified libraries that can make copies available to several offices
             in order to minimize the number of copies needed.
             4.4.4.2.7. Using DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
             Management, Programming Agencies should reproduce parts of documents when
             an individual office or subordinate command does not need the whole document.
  4.5. Education and Training (E&T) Requirements Determination Process. A key
  programming process is the E&T requirements determination process. E&T issues cut across
  all MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, with results that drive extensive programming actions and
  must follow certain timelines within the overarching PPBE process. It is important to
  establish a framework that Air Force agencies can work with to determine, document and
  fund E&T requirements. While the detailed sub-process guidance resides in other associated
  AFIs, Attachment 9 to this AFI provides the necessary overall framework for the E&T
  build. Air Force organizations are required to adhere to this framework and document those
  actions that drive programming actions.
  4.6. Limitations. Limit access to industrial firms under contract to the Air Force on a strict
  "need-to-know" basis as provided in DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 and DoD 5220.22-R,
  Industrial Security Regulation, December 1985 and AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program
22                                               AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


  Management, 29 June 2005. Do not release entire documents. The USD(C) will consider
  requests on a case-by-case basis. The commander responsible for procuring material,
  supplies, or services from a contractor or bidder may release or disclose only the classified
  information required to perform the specific contract or to prepare a specific bid or quotation.

AFCS (Air Force Corporate Structure)—Embodies the corporate review process for HQ
USAF. It does not replace the functional staff but, rather, enhances it by allowing time critical or
time limited functional reviews at the appropriate levels. The deliberative components of the
Corporate Structure are the Air Force Council (AFC), the Air Force Board (AFB), the Air Force
Group (AFG), and the thirteen Mission and Mission Support Panels. This structure increases
management effectiveness and improves cross-functional decision-making by providing a forum
in which senior Air Force leadership can apply their collective judgment, experience, and
analysis to major programs, objectives, and issues. This process balances programs among
mission areas, between force structure and support, and between readiness, modernization, and
transformation. Additionally, this approach ensures the Air Force program is capabilities based
and supports the Joint warfighter. Only military or Department of Defense civilian personnel
assigned to the Air Staff or Office of the Secretary of the Air Force may serve as members of the
corporate structure.

AFC (Air Force Council)—Advises and makes recommendations to the Chief of Staff and
Secretary on major matters, including the responsiveness of Air Force plans and programs to
national, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Air Force objectives. The
Vice Chief of Staff chairs the AFC. Membership is at the Deputy Chief of Staff (three-star)
level, corresponding Secretariat level, and selected Directorate (two-star) level (para 3.2).
AFB (Air Force Board)—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air Force Council
(AFC) on major programming and other staffing issues. In addition, the AFB conducts corporate
reviews of the resource allocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to
shape and refine proposals prior to presentation to the AFC. The AFB has decision authority for
issues submitted by the Air Force Group (AFG). The Director of Programs chairs the AFB,
except for purposes of budget formulation and execution to include the Program Budget Review
(PBR), Budget Review Cycle, and President’s Budget (PB), when the Deputy Assistant
Secretary (Budget) (SAF/FMB) chairs it. Membership is at the General officer/Senior Executive
Service level (para 3.3) but advisory members include the panel chairs, CONOPS Champions,
and those with special expertise.
AFG (Air Force Group)—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air Force Board
(AFB) on major programming and other staffing issues. Conducts corporate reviews of the
resource allocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to shape and
refine proposals prior to presentation to the AFB and the Air Force Council (AFC). The Deputy
Director of Programs chairs the AFG. Membership is at the Colonel/civilian equivalent level
(para 3.4), but advisory members include the panel chairs, CONOPS champions, and those with
special expertise. The AFG is the first level in the corporate structure that integrates the Air
Force mission, mission support areas, and capabilities into a balanced Air Force program.
Air Force Concept of Operation (AF CONOPS)—An Air Force Concept of Operations
delineates the highest service-level concept comprising a commander’s assumptions and intent to
achieve desired effects through the guided integration of capabilities and tasks that solve a
problem in an expected mission area.
AF CONOPS Champion—The Air Staff focal point for service-level CONOPS and the
capabilities described and required by that AF CONOPS. The Champion promotes the
attainment and sustainment of essential Air Force capabilities required to achieve the effects
needed by Joint Force Commanders (JFC) to fulfill their assigned missions. The Champion is
also responsible for leading the Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA) process,
advocating AF CONOPS, effects, and capabilities in all Department of Defense, Joint Staff, and
Air Staff capabilities-based planning processes, and informing the Air Force Corporate and the
Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System processes.
Air Force Mission/Mission Support Panel—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air
Force Group (AFG) on major programming and other issues. Conducts corporate reviews of the
resource allocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to shape and
refine proposals prior to the AFG. Serves as initial point of entry for all issues requiring
corporate review. Panels work closely with CONOPS Champions to ensure program capabilities
are consistent with Integrated Capabilities Review and Risk Assessments (CRRA). Chairs are
designated by appropriate Deputy Chief of Staff/Assistant Secretary (para 3.4.2).

Budget Year(s)—The year(s) following the current fiscal year, and for which the budget
estimate submission (BES) is prepared. For example, if the current fiscal year were FY 2005,
the budget year(s) would be FY 2006-07.
Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment—The Air Force process for identifying and
assessing the levels of capability needed to execute service-level concepts of operations,
determining the status of these capabilities to achieve desired effects, and recommending courses
of action to rectify overages, shortfalls, and gaps in the capability portfolio.
Disconnect—An approved program, which is unexecutable because of resource shortfalls.
Specific Air Force or Office of the Secretary of Defense Program Budget Decisions (PBDs) that
change the program content or pace in the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
cycle are not candidates for disconnects in the following year’s cycle.
D-22—Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Financial Management and
Comptroller, Directorate of Budget Operations (SAF/FMBO) Financial Plan exhibit used as a
vehicle to transfer Air Force Operations and Maintenance funds between commands to include

                      PROGRAM CHANGE REQUEST GUIDANCE

A3.1. General Guidelines for Air Force PCRs.
   A3.1.1. Final approval authority is SECAF.
   A3.1.2. Use PCR actions to make off cycle corrections to programs. Each PCR must be a
   stand-alone action that zero-balances in all years of the FYDP, so the PCR does not drive a
   bill to the Air Force.
   A3.1.3. Gaining and losing MAJCOMs must agree to exact dollar amount of request before
   submitting it to HQ USAF. PCRs will not be accepted without appropriate offsets identified
   for the budget and execution years as well as throughout the FYDP. All costs, to include
   tails, must be considered. Coordination between MAJCOM/FMs and MAJCOM/A8s is
   expected and should be documented for reference.
   A3.1.4. Identify adjustments to total Air Force Officer and Enlisted end strength by fiscal
   year and display funding by fiscal year. Transfers of end strengths between agencies and
   commands do not result in a change to the Air Force Military Personnel Appropriation unless
   positions are being added to or deleted from the Air Force manpower file.
   A3.1.5. After coordinating within Programming Agencies, submit PCRs to HQ USAF/A8P
   with informational copies to SAF/FMB, other Programming Agencies, and HQ USAF
   Mission/Mission Support Panels, as required. Submit PCRs by message (Attachment 4) or
   as an e-mail attachment (Attachment 5 and Attachment 6). Organizations with Defense
   Messaging System (DMS) capability should submit the PCR as a text file (Attachment 6)
   attached to a DMS message prepared according to standards.
   A3.1.6. Coordinate all end strength adjustments with HQ USAF/A1M. SAF/FMBOP will
   provide budgetary figures for manpower requirements.
   A3.1.7. Include in each PCR a detailed explanation of the costs involved for all
   appropriations/fund sources and Foreign Military Sales (FMS)/Security Assistance impacts.
   For Procurement Accounts, in addition to the PE, include the Budget Program (BP). Include
   out year costs and BP for PCR actions affecting out years. Coordinate PCR cost estimates
   and savings with appropriate MAJCOM or equivalent Financial Management and
   Comptroller staff prior to submission to USAF/A8P.
   A3.1.8. Identify in each PCR the source of cost estimates in each appropriation fund source.
   Specify offsets within each appropriation/fund source for the execution and budget year and
   throughout the FYDP. Offsets generated by FMS or Security Assistance programs must also
   be identified. Each offset will contain funding information to the program element and cost
   element detail. For Procurement Accounts, in addition to the PE, include the BP. Each PCR
   will be a stand-alone action. HQ USAF will reject using offsets from prior or subsequent
   PCRs. HQ USAF will return PCRs without action that do not contain sufficient offsets.
   A3.1.9. To identify PCRs, include the initiating organization name (Air Combat Command,
   National Guard Bureau, etc.), current fiscal year, and a sequential two-digit number (e.g.,
   AMC 08-01 is the first PCR AMC submits in Fiscal Year 08). AF/A8PE, as the Office of
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                         31


   Primary Responsibility, will assign PCR numbers for HQ USAF generated PCRs. The prefix
   will be HAF, followed by the current fiscal year and sequence number (e.g., HAF 08-01).
   A3.1.10. Coordinate all PCRs with Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A4) and identify
   potential support problems prior to sending them to HQ USAF. AFMC provides impacts
   then HQ USAF optimizes the bed down plan.
   A3.1.11. Each PCR will state that the requester has initiated an Environmental Impact
   Analysis Process (EIAP), as directed by AFI 32-7061, Environmental Impact Analysis
   Process, and as promulgated in AFPD 32-70, will identify which Program Agencies have
   coordinated on the PCR.

Subject:         ACC PCR 03-07

Attached is ACC PCR 03-07 concerning the proposed transfer of F-16 aircraft from Shaw to
Luke. It was released by HQ ACC/A8, Gen Smith.




Note: This is an example of an e-mail to which a PCR would be attached. Follow these
guidelines when using this method to submit a PCR:
1. Send the e-mail to exactly the same commands/offices that are on the addressee list on the
message itself (see next page). If the office has a Workflow or SCATS inbox, use that. If not, send
it to the office’s Executive Officer. The sender must determine which is appropriate for each
addressee, and must determine and verify the e-mail address for each addressee. All HAF
Workflow and SCATS inboxes used in this example are correct as of this writing. Other
addresses shown are representative and only for example purposes. Individual names are
imaginary.
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                                 45


2. Do not put the PCR in the body of the e-mail itself, since text formatting is often lost when
doing so. Make the PCR an attachment instead (see Attachment 5).
3. Make the attachment a stand-alone PCR, to include all addressee information.
4. Do not submit an official PCR unless it has been released by the appropriate authority.
5. When e-mailing a "working draft" PCR to the HAF AO for coord, mark the PCR "DRAFT".
6. Note Classification – SEE CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE, para 13.

                                   PROGRAM ELEMENTS

A7.1. Creating or Changing Program Elements.
   A7.1.1. To create or change PEs, send requests to appropriate Air Staff Panel. The Air Staff
   Panel submits the request into the current/processing database and coordinates with HQ
   USAF/A8PE. HQ USAF/A8PE coordinates with the Secretariat, and then submits the
   request to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Director,
   Program Analysis and Evaluation, for approval. The Air Staff Panel will submit the Air
   Force Program (AFP) request via the current PE database. HQ USAF/A8PE will confirm
   AFP request with Panel Chair. Once the request is approved, HQ USAF/A8PE will notify
   Panel and ensure the AFP is added to appropriate databases. When submitting a request, be
   sure to include the following information:
   A7.1.2. State whether the request is to create a new PE, or to change an existing PE.
   A7.1.3. State the title of the PE.
   A7.1.4. State justification for why this PE is needed, or why it should be modified. Include
   a recommendation for panel assignment.
   A7.1.5. PE Description.
   A7.1.6. The action officer’s name, office, and telephone number.
   A7.1.7. State the AFP code. If the AFP does not exist submit an AFP Request Form
   (Attachment 8) along with PE request to the Air Staff Panel.
A7.2. Air Force Programs (AFP).
   A7.2.1. AFP is a time phased set of resources that supports the activities that operate,
   modify, sustain or acquire weapon or support systems, or relate to the functions that supports
   the infrastructure needed to operate, maintain and acquire forces, and acquire and train
   personnel. The resources include dollars, forces and manpower.

NOTE: AFPs are only for internal AF deliberative processes.
   A7.2.2. An AFP consists of a six-digit program code, title, and description in the F&FP
   system of the ABIDES database tables and in the AF FSMS. The main purpose of the code
   is to provide programmatic insight into the F&FP database. In addition, the coding structure
   facilitates rapid viewing of groupings that cut across programs, program elements, and
   Panels. Examples of these cross-cutters are Depot Purchase Equipment Maintenance
   (DPEM), Aerospace Vehicle Petroleum (AVPOL), Military and Civilian Pay, and Military
   Construction. No program code will be created without identifying dollars to support it.
   A7.2.3. Administration of AFP: HQ USAF/A8PE shall review all AFP additions, deletions,
   and changes.
   A7.2.4. Process for Creating or Changing AFPs:
       A7.2.4.1. The Panel must receive authorization from Panel Chair before submitting AFP
       code within current database for approval.
AFI16-501_AFGSCSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                       47


     A7.2.4.2. The request should state the definition and justification for the AFP.
     A7.2.4.3. State the current program you are moving dollars from only when applicable.
     A7.2.4.4. State the PE and Appropriation (Appn) associated with the proposed program.
     A7.2.4.5. Coordinate with Appn Mgr(s), Program Element Monitor(s) and MAJCOM(s).
     A7.2.4.6. Panel must submit a Zero Balance Transfer (ZBT) with a temporary AFP code,
     when appropriate.
     A7.2.4.7. The Panel will propose an AFP Group and AFP Roll-up code when required.
  A7.2.5. AF/A8PE will confirm AFP request with Panel Chair. Once the request is approved,
