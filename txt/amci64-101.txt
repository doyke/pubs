SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include:
the elimination of the AMC Acquisition Circular (AMCAC) which was used to revise the AMC Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AMCFARS) and announce contracting policy, procedures, and
instructions. The AMCFARS was rendered obsolete and unnecessary with the issuance of Air Force
Acquisition Circular (AFAC) 2006-0515. This revision establishes the AMC Contracting Policy Letter as
the means by which the HQ AMC Contracting Division will document and disseminate significant policy
and guidance to all AMC contracting activities.


1. How AMC Contracting Policy Letters (AMCCPLs) Are Used. The AMCCPLs are used by the
AMC Contracting Division, Directorate of Installations and Mission Support, to announce contracting
policy and guidance. Each AMCCPL will include an effective date and any associated FAR or supplement
references relevant to the policy or guidance being issued.
