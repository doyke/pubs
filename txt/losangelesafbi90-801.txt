1. Background. 61 ABG will provide safe and healthful workplaces and conduct operations in
a manner that minimizes risk to mission accomplishment while preserving resources, protecting
the environment, and safeguarding Air Force personnel and the public both on and off the
installation. ESOHCs oversee implementation of AFPD 90-8 and all related guidance, and are an
integral part of the Air Force ESOH Management System (ESOHMS). As the primary ESOH

steering group, the ESOHC reviews policies and programs, establishes goals, monitors progress,
and advises leadership.
2. Concept.
     2.1. This instruction provides a framework to oversee the integration of LAAFB’s Core
     Mission Areas with Air Force environment, safety, and occupational health programs as
     defined by AFPD 90-8, Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health and Risk
     Management, AFPD 91-2, Safety Program, AFPD 91-3, Occupational Safety and Health,
     AFPD 32-70 Environmental Quality, AFPD 40-2, Radioactive Materials, and AFPD 48-1,
     Aerospace Medicine Program.
     2.2. The ESOHC should ensure the appropriate level of ESOH assets are sustained, restored,
     and modernized to achieve the desired mission capability using a risk-based decision making
     process.
3. Purpose. The ESOHC is the cornerstone of the ESOH program and provides senior
leadership involvement and direction at all levels of command; annually establishes goals,
measures, objectives, and targets; and provides additional ESOH guidance to subordinate
organizations as required.
4. ESOHC Membership. ESOHC members ensure their areas of responsibility participate in
the interdisciplinary, integrated approach to environment, safety, and occupational health issues
     4.1. ESOHC will be chaired by 61 ABG/CC. Membership will include the following
     organizations and offices. Each organization may send a designated representative, as
     appropriate.

      preventing and reducing the discharge of pollutants into receiving waters and will ensure
      compliance with construction, industrial and storm sewer system permits.
      5.3.4. Green Procurement Program (GPP) Team. USAF Memorandum Policy to
      Establish the Air Force Green Procurement Program, dated 29 Sep 06, requires
      Installation ESOHCs to establish a GPP team to develop and implement a viable GPP.
   5.4. Act as the primary executive steering group to ensure ESOH management decisions
   enhance mission capability.
   5.5. Oversee ESOH Management System implementation and ESOH performance to ensure
   continual improvement consistent with Air Force ESOH goals and objectives.
   5.6. Report and track instances where a mission or operation has been, or is expected to be,
   negatively impacted because of ESOH restrictions; and actions taken to affect, change, or
   eliminate the impact.
6. Records.
   6.1. Preparation: Within 30 days following an ESOHC or sub-committee meeting, the
   executive secretary prepares and coordinates minutes for distribution. The minutes will
   summarize the substance and outcome of all discussions.
