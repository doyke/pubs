                                           Chapter 1

                                            POLICY

1.1. Sound Judgment. Instructions in this AFI are mandatory and provide the best possible
operating instructions under most circumstances, but can not account for every possible situation
that a crewmember may encounter during contingency operations. During these times the
loadmaster must use his/her sound judgment and operational risk management to meet mission
demands.
1.2. General. This instruction establishes basic cargo compartment configuration, standard
equipment, and equipment locations aboard C-130J, C-130J (short version), and WC-130J
aircraft. In order to meet HQ AF guidance toward conserving fuel, equipment will be removed
when not needed to reduce the aircraft weight In Accordance With (IAW) Table 1.1, Table 2.1
and Table 2.2 Aircraft will not have tool boxes larger than the standard crew chief tool box, nor
large garbage cans onboard the aircraft. Some C-130J aircraft have additional equipment
installed that may affect configuring the aircraft as listed. For operational planning purposes,
each configuration has an average time annotated and number of personnel to configure the
airplane. The times quoted are approximate figures and are configuration times only. They do
not include de-configuration times. For example, reconfiguring from a P-1 configuration, 128
sidewall and center aisle seats to a C-1 configuration (clean floor) requires more than one-half
hour for one person, which is the time allocated to configure a C-1 configuration. Units with
operational control over the WC-130J will determine standard configurations except when
aircraft are gained to AMC.
1.3. Responsibility. Operational plans must consider the most appropriate configuration that
satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and man-hours to
change. USAF units performing services on C-130J/C-130J(S)/WC-130J aircraft (i.e.,
maintenance, aerial port, and aircrew flight equipment) are responsible for configuring the
aircraft IAW this instruction and as outlined in mission directives, to include equipment
stowage/installation IAW the configuration and equipment tables. Aircrew Flight Equipment
(AFE) personnel will ensure all life sustaining equipment is positioned on the aircraft to meet
mission requirements IAW Table 1.1. Maintenance personnel will ensure all required and
mission specific equipment is positioned aboard the aircraft to meet mission requirements IAW
Table 2.1 and Table 2.2. Some equipment listed in Table 2.2 is roll on/roll off equipment
controlled by unit designated personnel. Before home station departure, maintenance personnel
are responsible for configuring the aircraft (including modifications) to meet mission
requirements IAW Figure 3.1 thru Figure 3.64. For the CP-2 through CP-5 configurations, the
sidewall seats will be stowed to facilitate preflight of the Enhanced Cargo Handling System
(ECHS) rails and then lowered by aircrew with maintenance assistance. After departure from
home station, the aircrew will accomplish all configurations with assistance by
maintenance/aerial port personnel if available. During preflight, aircrew will ensure required
mission equipment has been provided and is properly installed. When the aircraft configuration
is not completed prior to aircrew show time, the loadmaster will assist in the completion of the
configuration, after accomplishing required pre-departure duties (i.e., preflight, loading, etc.).
Loadmasters have overall responsibility for configuration management and proper installation of
equipment on the aircraft.
8                                             AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA 9 DECEMBER 2009


1.4. Standard Configuration Codes. Use the following codes when referring to C-130J/C-
130J (short)/WC-130J cargo compartment configurations.
    1.4.1. S – C-130J (short version)
    1.4.2. A* - Armor Equipped Aircraft
    1.4.3. AE - Aeromedical Evacuation
    1.4.4. C - Cargo
    1.4.5. CP - Cargo and Passengers
    1.4.6. P - Passengers
    1.4.7. TAP - Tactical Airdrop Paratroop
    1.4.8. TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo
    1.4.9. NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration
1.5. Modifications. Configuration codes of this instruction may require modifications for a
specific mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to
ensure maximum flight safety and aircraft equipment compatibility. Each mission directive will
identify basic configuration codes and modifications to satisfy mission requirements. For
example, an aeromedical evacuation mission may require more litters than available in
configuration AE-1. Consult appropriate configuration charts to determine where the desired
additional litters can be installed and which seats must be removed. Indicate in the mission
directive, by position (left or right, and number) which seats are deleted and (by alphabetical
position) litter tier provisions are installed. Example: Configuration AE-1(Mod), remove seats
12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D.
1.6. Weight and Balance. Configuration equipment and necessary supply changes affect
aircraft weight and balance. To standardize equipment quantities and location, items shown in
Table 2.1 will be included in the aircraft basic weight and remain on the aircraft except for
maintenance and inspection. Equipment listed in Table 1.1 and Table 2.2 will be added as
necessary     when     computing    the     weight     and      balance    and    entered  in
Communications/Navigation/Identification-Management Unit (CNI-MU) and references 5, 6, or
7 of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical. The
loadmaster will enter the weight contained in the required equipment table for the applicable
configuration in the CNI-MU and when preparing the DD Form 365-4. Adjustments will be
made when the actual on board weight of these items vary from the data shown. Add aircraft
armor (Table 4.2) into the DD Form 365-4 (Form F) if armor is installed on the aircraft.
Paratroop door armor moments need to be re-calculated when armor is re-positioned. DD Form
365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
1.7. Revisions. To recommend changes, conflicts, suggestions, or recommendations to
departmental publications, use the AF Form 847 and route it through the publishing channels to
the OPR for the publication.
1.8. Aircraft Configuration Waivers and Supplements. Follow waiver protocol in AFI 11-
2C-130J, Volume 3. MAJCOMs forward approved requests to HQ AMC/A3V for continuity.
AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                                9


1.9. Aircrew Life Sustaining Equipment Configuration. Mobility Air Forces C-130J aircraft
are configured with standard quantities of aircrew life sustaining equipment (ALSE) IAW this
instruction. Configure aircraft as listed in Table 1.1. During aircraft contingency/deployment
generations, it is imperative that aircraft deploy with the full complement of ALSE. This
equipment must be at forward operating locations to allow maximum mission flexibility when
aircraft are away from home station. In the event installed ALSE inspection dates expire while
the aircraft is on alert status or away from operating location, place these items in the AFTO
Form 781A on a red dash until the aircraft goes off alert or returns to operating location. When
aircraft is released from alert or returns to operating location, upgrade to a red X IAW TO 00-20-
1 Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
   1.9.1. Aircraft Transfer Requirements. When transferring aircraft; position ALSE IAW
   permanent transfer configuration. Losing unit will contact the gaining organization’s AFE
   section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The
   gaining organization will conduct an acceptance inspection and forward a copy of
   discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW TO
   00-20-1. Without documented coordination and approval, do not transfer aircraft with less
   than the required equipment. The losing organization must make up any shortages from on-
   hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
   1.9.2. ALSE Overhead Racks. Handle ALSE with care to avoid damage to the equipment.
   ALSE will always be placed in the overhead racks, unless stowed elsewhere for aircraft CG
   limitations. The primary purpose of all overhead racks is for ALSE. Other items of
   equipment placed in the overhead racks must not interfere with ALSE life sustaining
   equipment and be easily secured. Oil, hydraulic fluid or other liquids will not be placed on
   the rack.
   1.9.3. Aircraft Returning From Off station. To minimize AFE reconfiguration time upon
   return from off station operations, crewmembers must return parachutes, kits, and AFE life
   sustaining equipment to their primary position after each mission. AFE personnel will ensure
   the aircraft is returned to the local training configuration at earliest opportunity not to exceed
   5 workdays. The five work day rule does not apply if the aircraft will not be flown during
   that period. In this case the aircraft will be in the proper configuration prior to next flight.
   All added equipment will be removed; under no circumstances will an aircraft be flown in a
   partial configuration. NOTE: Items listed in the table below are for stretch aircraft. Short
   aircraft numbers are in parentheses as needed.

 NOTES:
 1. Each aircraft should have one EPOS per passenger. EPOS have to be accessible, they do not
 have to be stationed at each seat. Do not exceed FL 250 if the number of passengers exceeds
 the number of EPOS onboard.
 2. Only required on contingency missions.
 3. Required for overwater flights. When parachutes are carried LPU-10/P quantities will match
 parachutes. LPU-10/Ps are designed to integrate with AFE used by aircrew personnel. A/C
 LPUs are not compatible and shall not be used with parachutes, survival vest, ABA, and
 Aircrew Eye Respiratory Protection System (AERPS).
 4. Three PBE’s will be placed on the flight deck and two in the cargo compartment, one
 forward and one aft.
 5. Preposition parachutes during actual contingency missions with hostilities and hazardous
 functional or acceptance check flights only. When carried, aircraft will have one parachute per
 crewmember. Each crewmember will wear or fit and have readily accessible for bailout. ML-4
 kits are required only for overwater flights when parachutes are carried.
 6. Any unit scheduled to conduct operations above 78 degrees north or below 60 degrees south

                                             Chapter 3

  FLOOR PLANS AND REQUIRED EQUIPMENT WEIGHT AND BALANCE DATA

3.1. General. This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configuration in floor plan format
and weight, location, and moment data for associated required equipment.
3.2. Configuration. Although basic configuration modifications are authorized to meet special
requirements, the following factors shall be considered:
   3.2.1. Single sidewall seats shall not be used unless connected to a double sidewall seat
   (except for specific configurations).
   3.2.2. Passengers/ambulatory patients may not be seated closer than 30 inches in front of
   palletized, netted cargo or cargo secure with straps. This does not apply to cargo restrained
   by chains/chain bridle assemblies. When palletized or non-palletized cargo is secured with
   aircraft tie down chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required. EXCEPTION: Always
   maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters.
       3.2.2.1. Parachutes will be carried IAW Table 1.1. When passengers/troops are carried
       with parachutes on board, up to four seats will not be available in the cargo compartment.
   3.2.3. Normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches; however, spacing will be as mission
   dictates. Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch
   spacing.
   3.2.4. Cargo height in pallet position two may be restricted if overhead equipment rack(s)
   protrude into the cargo area. This restriction will be 76 inches and will begin at the inboard
   side of the cargo handling system rails and extend inboard 12 inches. This restriction could
   be on either or both sides of the aircraft.
   3.2.5. For flight, the aircraft ramp’s cargo weight limit is 5,000 pounds of floor loaded or
   palletized cargo in pallet position eight (six for short), (to include the weight of pallet and
   nets). See TO 1C-130J-9 for other restrictions.
   3.2.6. Changes in configuration may affect overall aircraft center of gravity (CG). NOTE:
   The addition of aircraft defensive systems, Kevlar, and other modifications produces a
   forward CG which must be countered by adjusting the load center of balance within TO 1C-
   130J-1 limits. Weight for this equipment is in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3.
   3.2.7. This chapter’s drawings are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft
   locations. Clear space depicted forward of the first center aisle seat and aft of the last center
   aisle seat on STAP-1/TAP-1 configuration is unusable. NOTE: Center aisle seats begin at
   the first seat stanchion point LS 357 (262)
   3.2.8. A 20-inch clear area is required on the forward right side of a ramp pallet to allow
   access to aft latrine facilities. A safety aisle is required in pallet positions four, five and eight
   or for C-130J(S) three, four, and six. (Para 4.2.3, Figure 4.1).
   3.2.9. Trashcans, other than integral containers, will not be carried.
   3.2.10. Seats 1 and 2, left side will be stowed to allow unrestricted flight deck/crew entrance
   door access when the seats are not needed to accomplish a specific mission.

     3.2.11. Configurations’ seat totals include seats designated for loadmasters.
     3.2.12. ECHS lock/seat stanchion locations is provided in Table 4.4.
     3.2.13. Aeromedical evacuation (AE) configurations. Medical Crew Directors (MCD) and
     Charge Medical Technician (CMT) will determine final litter equipment configuration and
     aeromedical evacuation crewmember (AECM) seating. AECM seat locations may vary
     based on patient/cabin observation requirements. Overhead equipment racks, missile defense
     system modifications, and secure voice communications system will decrease litter capacity
     in litter tiers adjacent to their installation.          Up to six seats are required for
     AECM’s/loadmaster(s) depending on crew complement.                    Seats are numbered for
     identification from front to rear and will be referred to as seat 1-left, or seat 1-right, etc.
     Litter tiers are identified alphabetically and litter spaces identified numerically from lowest
     (1) to highest (5). On litter tier configuration illustrations, the number in parentheses
     indicates total litters per tier. Roller conveyers will be stowed where litters and seats are
     rigged. AE equipment, which may be secured in unused seats if floor space is limited, may
     reduce seat availability. Portable therapeutic liquid oxygen (PTLOX) shall be stowed in a
     location to prevent contact with fuels or hydraulic fluids. NOTE: Five portable oxygen
     bottles/PBEs will be available for AE personnel on AE and NASA configurations.
     3.2.14. Aircraft protective armor will be added as needed, and must be added into Ref. 7 of
     the DD Form 365-4.
     3.2.15. Some aircraft may be nose heavy due to armor installation and other modifications.
     Actual amount of passengers/litter patients/paratroopers/cargo allowed onboard may vary as
     determined by aircraft center of gravity limitations.
     3.2.16. When seating passengers next to cargo, consideration should be given to cargo
     (palletized/rolling stock) size and adequate passenger legroom. For cargo width up to 76
     inches, passengers may be seated on both sides. For widths 77-96 inches, passengers may be
     seated on one side if the cargo is offset to one side laterally. For widths 97 inches or greater,
     no passengers will be seated next to the cargo. For cargo positioned within the wheel well
     area: cargo width up to 52 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides; for widths 53-72
     inches, passengers may be seated on one side of cargo if offset; and for widths 73 inches and
     greater, no passengers will be seated in the wheel well.
3.3. Troop Life Preserver. If paratroopers are jumping near or over large bodies of water, the
service being airdropped will furnish required life preservers. However, life preservers, as
indicated in applicable configurations, will still be provided as required to cover emergency
ditching operations.
3.4. Crew/Passenger/Troop Drinking Water. Each basic configuration provides for an
adequate amount of drinking water. For example, a two-gallon water container will always be
provided; and for missions requiring more water in accordance with Table 5.3, additional
containers are available. Table 5.3 is provided to assist in determining water quantities.
However, the table is not provided as an absolute requirement and should not be used to cause
mission delay or refusal to airlift passengers. At no time will a mission be flown with no water
aboard. NOTE: When deploying to an austere environment or locations where a potable water
source is unavailable, ensure a sufficient amount of water is onboard to complete the mission.

                                              Chapter 4

                                       REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.
4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following
emergency exits and safety aisles are available:
     4.2.1. Equipment will not be positioned in a manner that obstructs the side emergency
     escape hatches. An obstruction is any equipment that prevents the effective means of rapid
     evacuation. Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered to be an
     obstruction.
     4.2.2. One unobstructed emergency exit will be available for each 20 passengers/troops.
     (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for
     egress.)
     4.2.3. When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisleway will be maintained in
     the wheel well (C-130J pallet positions 4 and 5) (C-130J(S) pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp
     area (C-130J pallet position 8) (C-130J(S) pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency
     exits. In the wheel well area, the aisleway will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the
     outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and will begin at the cargo floor or cargo handling
     system (CHS) outboard frame. Tiedown equipment (463L nets, straps, chains, and devices)
     shall not normally be considered an obstruction. The CHS outboard frame provides 8 inches
     of the 14-inch requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1.). In the ramp area, the
     aisleway will be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the CHS outboard
     frame. The aisleway should normally be on the left side of the aircraft. If the aisleway is
     placed on the right side of the aircraft, then clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be
     maintained. Additionally, access to aft latrine facilities requires a 20-inch clear area on the
     forward right side of cargo loaded on the ramp. The clear area must be on the right side of
     the pallet.
     4.2.4. If the aisleway requirement in paragraph 4.2.3. cannot be achieved on missions
     carrying crew only or MEPs authorized by operations order/plan or DIRMOBFOR, then an
     aisleway will be maintained in the wheel well area that provides a minimum of 14 inches
     between the outer edge of the cargo and aircraft beginning no higher than 36 inches above
     the floor/pallet/platform or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of cargo and the
     aircraft beginning no higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. The CHS
     outboard frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1).
     MAJCOM/A3/DO is authorized to waive this requirement based on MAJCOM/A3V
     evaluation and recommendation.
     4.2.5. During airdrop missions loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to
     accomplish tactical checklists.
     4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to
     the rear of the aircraft. Loads in Section VI of TO 1C-130J-9 are specific and do not require
     a waiver.

         WEIGHT & BALANCE INPUTS AND DD FORM 365-4 INSTRUCTIONS

5.1. Introduction. The loadmaster is responsible for entering weight and balance data into the
CNI-MU Wt. and Bal. pages, and transferring that information onto the DD Form 365-4 Form-F.
This can either be accomplished manually, or electronically utilizing the Automated Form F
(AFF) program and printer. Instructions for use of the AFF program can be found in the C-130
AFF training guide.
5.2. Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so the center of gravity of the loaded
aircraft will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition.
Consideration must also be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency
jettisoning. Math charts contained in TOs 1C-130(C)J-5-1, 1C-130J-5-1, 1C-130(C)J-5-2, and
1C-130J-5-2 are tools, which may be used for load planning. When the fuel load is unknown,
load plan for a 20-22 percent of MAC zero fuel.
5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to Transport Forms F using simplified
moments. Copy the information the CNI-MU weight and balance pages onto the Form F, plus
the heading information. A copy of the completed DD Form 365-4 Form F shall be attached to
the flight plan, or given to the controlling ground agency, quality assurance, transient alert,
maintenance, etc.
     5.3.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number,
     departure and destination station (name or ICAO identifier), home station of aircraft, and
     pilot's rank and last name.
     5.3.2. Limitations Column. Enter the appropriate weight and CG limits for the planned
     mission using the following criteria: the maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits
     specified in TO 1C-130J-1 will not be exceeded. Gross weights may also be limited by
     operating conditions; i.e., obstacle clearance, rate of climb, weather conditions, altitude,
     runway/taxiway bearing capacity, or any other published restrictions. The pilot will inform
     the loadmaster of any gross weight restrictions prior to mission planning so an accurate ACL
     may be obtained.
        5.3.2.1. Takeoff. Unless other restrictions are imposed, use 164,000 pounds for the C-
        130J and 155,000 pounds for the C-130J (S).
        5.3.2.2. Landing. Unless other landing restrictions such as assault landings are imposed,
        use 164,000 pounds for the C-130J and 155,000 pounds for the C-130J (S). Subtract
        operating weight plus estimated landing fuel (references 9 and 23). Refer to the T.O. 1C-
        130J-1 C-130J Flight Manual for assault landing limitations.
        5.3.2.3. Limiting Wing Fuel. The CNI-MU is the primary method to compute Limiting
        Wing Fuel. The limiting wing fuel chart in TO 1C-130J-1 is based on a 2.5 G maneuver
        load factor with indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual
        limitation charts. Specific mission requirements exceeding area "C" limitations must be
        computed using the appropriate flight manual weight limitation charts
AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                           87


   5.3.3. Permissible C.G. Takeoff and Landing. Compute the forward and aft center of gravity
   limitations using the center of gravity table in the appropriate TO 1C-130(C)J-5-2 or 1C-
   130J-5-2. Leave the block entitled "Permissible CG Zero Fuel Wt" blank.
   5.3.4. Signature Blocks:
       5.3.4.1. Computed by: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate.
       5.3.4.2. Weight and Balance Authority: Leave blank
       5.3.4.3. Pilot: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate.
5.4. Instructions for Form F. Copy the information from data entered in the CNI-MU Weight
and Balance pages and handwrite, type, or computer generate a copy of the DD Form 365-4.
NOTE: In the remarks section, enter a breakdown of takeoff fuel weight for each tank to the
nearest 100 pounds and moments using the CNI-MU. NOTE: During engine running onloads
or when planned ground times require, a combined load C/B may be used if a validated load plan
is presented, and the aircraft is loaded per the load plan.
   5.4.1. Compute and enter zero fuel weight and zero fuel moment by zeroing out the Take-
   Off and Landing fuels on the Fuel page. Return to the main weight and balance page to
   calculate the Take-off and Landing Zero Fuel Weight. After calculations have been entered
   return to the fuel page and return the fuel to its original state. Zero fuel percent of MAC is
   not required, but may be helpful when targeting a 20-22 zero fuel percent of MAC.
   5.4.2. Reference 22. If required, subtract airdrop load weight and moment from reference 21
   or changes in corrections column and enter as adjusted zero fuel weight/moment on first
   blank line in reference 22. First blank line title will read, ―ADJ ZFW/M‖.
   5.4.3. Use the following criteria to compute fuel burn off when flight plan fuel weights are
   not available. (PPH = pounds per hour.)
       5.4.3.1. 4,000 PPH - normal flight at altitude
       5.4.3.2. 5,000 PPH - first hour of flight (climb out) or low level.

Terms
Additional Crewmember (ACM)— Aircrew members not required for a particular mission
being flown, but who are required for follow-on missions.
Aeromedical Evacuation— Movement of patients under medical supervision between medical
treatment facilities by air transportation.
Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Member— Qualified Flight Nurses (FN), Aeromedical
Evacuation Technicians (AET), performing AE crew duties.
Air Reserve Component (ARC)— Refers to Air National Guard and AFRC forces, both
Associate and Unit Equipped.
Allowable Cabin Load (ACL)— The maximum payload that can be carried on an individual
sortie.
Director, Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR)— In overseas theaters, the DIRMOBFOR is
normally responsible for theater mobility force management. The Air Force component
commander exercises operational control of assigned or attached mobility forces through the
DIRMOBFOR. The DIRMOBFOR monitors and manages assigned mobility forces operating in
theater.
Distinguished Visitor (DV)— Passengers, including those of friendly nations, of star or flag
rank or equivalent status to include diplomats, cabinet members, members of Congress, and other
individuals designated by the DoD due to their mission or position (includes BLUE BARK and
COIN ASSIST).
Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT)— Continuation and proficiency
combat airlift training conducted in support of DOD agencies. Includes aircraft load training and
service school support. HQ AMC publishes JA/ATT tasking in AMC OPORD 17-76, annex C,
appendix 1.
Local Training Mission— A mission scheduled to originate and terminate at home station (or
an off-station training mission), generated for training or evaluation and executed at the local
level.
Medical Crew Director (MCD)— A qualified Flight Nurse (FN) responsible for supervising
patient care and AECMs assigned to AE missions. On missions where an FN is not onboard, the
senior AET will function as MCD.
Operational Missions— Missions executed at or above TACC level. Operational missions
termed ‖CLOSE WATCH‖ include CORONET missions and priority 1, 2, and 3 missions tasked
by TACC. Other operational missions such as deployment, re-deployment, reconnaissance
operations, operational readiness inspections (ORI), AMC-directed channel or SAAM, and
JA/ATT missions may be designated ―CLOSE WATCH‖ as necessary.
