recent updates to new DOD continuity related instructions and incorporates guidance for
business continuity as a subset of continuity. This rewrite reflects the transfer of HAF continuity
program, planning and execution responsibilities and associated Pentagon emergency
management and incident command responsibilities to the Air Force District of Washington
(AFDW). It also outlines HAF organizational responsibilities for continuity, personnel
accountability and emergency evacuation. It implements requirements for Balanced Survivability
Assessments in the Air Force. It establishes AF responsibilities for emergency management and
incident command of the Pentagon facilities and authorities for Raven Rock Mountain Complex.

(AFSOC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include supplemental instructions specific to HQ AFSOC, wing, group, and
squadron/unit levels; appointment letter, annual certification, and expenditure report examples;
inclusion of a self inspection checklist.

                                           Chapter 1

 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE CONTINUITY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY
                           GUIDANCE

1.1. Air Force Continuity.
1.1. (AFSOC)1. The AFSOC COOP program provides continuity for mission essential
functions (MEF) during conditions when normal operations have been threatened, impaired, or
made impossible. Unless otherwise stated, and as supplemented, AFI 10-208, COOP guidance,
rules, requirements, and business practices apply to all present and future AFSOC HQ, wings,
groups, and subordinate units (HQ AFSOC directorates/special staff agencies, 23d Air Forces,
Wings, Groups, subordinate units, units with a mission supporting AFSOC active duty units and
AFSOC-gained Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units after
mobilization, and tenants with regard to installation commander protect/direct/safeguard
responsibilities).
   1.1.1. It is Air Force guidance to maintain a comprehensive and effective continuity
   capability to preserve Air Force functions, missions and capabilities in support of DOD and
   Air Force Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs).
   1.1.2. All levels of command will plan, budget and be prepared to execute their Mission
   Essential Functions (MEFs), support execution of the Air Force and DOD PMEFs, project
   forces supporting Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), and when directed by the Secretary of
   Defense (SecDef), support civil and humanitarian requests.
   1.1.3. Continuity requirements must be incorporated into the daily operations of
   organizations to ensure seamless and immediate continuation of essential functions during
   and after a wide range of emergencies, including local or regional natural disasters, health-
   related emergencies, man-made disasters, accidents, technological limitations or attack-
   related emergencies.
   1.1.4. Air Force military, civilian and contract personnel with continuity responsibilities
   should know what actions to take without warning, across a wide range of potential
   emergencies.
   1.1.5. Continuity is a primary enabler of operational capability.
       1.1.5.1. Continuity is focused on maintaining the capability to perform the mission and
       the essential functions which comprise the mission.
       1.1.5.2. Continuity is best achieved through integration with the suite of programs that
       enable operational capability to continue with limited or no impact to mission execution,
       should an event or other disruption occur. Organizations and installations should develop
       integrated solutions among all programs that most effectively and efficiently enhance
       mission execution. These include integrated defense/force protection, anti-terrorism,
       critical infrastructure program (CIP)/critical asset risk management (CARM) and
       emergency management.
       1.1.5.3. Continuity planning should consider all-hazards, but emphasize events or other
       disruptions which will most likely degrade operations.
 6                                                   AFI10-208_AFSOCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


        1.1.5.4. Risk management methodologies, focused on the continuation of mission
        capability, should be used to identify and develop mitigation solutions, which should in-
        turn be used to prioritize and justify the allocation of budgetary resources.
     1.1.6. Continuity requires unity of effort between the mission owner and the installation to
     establish protection priorities on the installation.
     1.1.7. Business continuity is a collaborative effort among continuity, integrated defense,
     anti-terrorism and emergency management programs. Business continuity must comply with
     military and civilian personnel policies, to include telework guidance established by Deputy
     Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1) and computer system security
     requirements established by Chief of Warfighting Integration and Chief Information Officer
     (SAF/CIO A6).
1.2. Continuity Guidance. COOP planning should remain operationally focused on command
and control and prioritized through contingency and crisis planning.
1.3. Continuity Preparedness Objectives.
     1.3.1. Ensure the Air Force can continue its essential functions under all conditions.
     1.3.2. Ensure availability of personnel, critical assets, essential facilities, equipment, records
     and other assets necessary to continue MEFs in the event of a disruption.
     1.3.3. Execute a successful order of succession and/or delegation of authority in the event a
     disruption renders leadership unavailable or incapable of executing their responsibilities
     and/or exercising their authorities.
     1.3.4. Execute return to normal operations upon termination of a continuity event.

                              COOP PLAN DEVELOPMENT

3.1. Writing COOP Plans. COOP plans should use planning factors contained in this
instruction and War & Mobilization Plan, Vol 1 (WMP-1), Basic Planning. To ensure fully
integrated response operations, commanders should include COOP plans with other installation
plans, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), Integrated Defense
Plan (IDP), Antiterrorism (AT) Plan, Disease Containment Plans or other plans as long as all
COOP planning factors, risks and controls are addressed. If Commands combine COOP plans
with their other plans, such as CEMP, title the plan "CEMP/COOP- (organization designation)."
Although AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats and Guidance, is the recommended
plan format, organizations can adopt any format that best achieves their planning goals or as
directed by the MAJCOM.
   3.1.1. COOP plans should comply with guidance in the following documents:
       3.1.1.1. AFDD 3-10, Force Protection
       3.1.1.2. AFI 10-2604, Disease Containment Planning Guidance – plan for continuation
       of MEFs during a pandemic or other contagious biological event or outbreak.
       3.1.1.3. AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
       Operations – plan for continuation of MEFs during or following a major accident, natural
       disaster, conventional attacks (including high-yield explosives), or terrorist use of
       Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) materials. Incorporates CEMP
       10-2.
       3.1.1.4. AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting – comply with reporting requirements upon
       COOP activation and movement to alternate locations.
       3.1.1.5. AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution – comply with
       reporting requirements.
       3.1.1.6. AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC) – comply with security requirements.
       Develop OPSEC standards based on the priority of the MEF.
       3.1.1.7. AFPD 10-24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP) – implements a
       mission-focused, Air Force Task Critical Asset (TCA) identification and Critical Asset
       Risk Assessment (CARA) process. All CIP critical assets are designated as TCAs, with a
       subset of this list being designated as Defense Critical Assets (DCAs).
       3.1.1.7.1. War Mobilization Plan I (WMP-1) – contains additional factors to assist with
       planning efforts.
       3.1.1.8. AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism
       3.1.1.9. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
3.2. Classifying COOP Plans. Classify COOP plans according to content, as required by
applicable overarching program security guidance, MEFs, mission criticality, capabilities, key
personnel movement, compilation of data revealing additional associations or relationships and
the specific plan(s) supported. COOP plans directly supporting the national essential functions
AFI10-208_AFSOCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                           23


or DoD or AF primary MEFs will be not be marked lower than secret. Other COOP plans will
not be marked lower than For Official Use Only (FOUO).
   3.2.1. Use DoD Defense Continuity Program (DCP) Security Classification Guide, (15 Dec
   05) for details and to determine specific classification decisions ambiguity exists and/or no
   original classification authority (OCA) is available.
   3.2.2. Refer to the ―Continuity of Operations (COOP) /Continuity of Government (COG)‖
   Community of Practice for the Defense Continuity Security Classification Guidance
   (SIPRNet) or contact coop@pentagon.af.mil or coop@af.pentagon.smil.mil for a copy.
3.3. COOP Plan Review. Organizations are required to validate and update their COOP plan
every two years.
3.4. Elements of a Continuity Plan. COOP plans should be executable with and without
warning, during and after duty hours and should include the following elements:
   3.4.1. Mission Essential Functions. Prior to writing continuity plans, organizations should
   thoroughly analyze their organization‘s mission, functions, supporting activities,
   communication and vital records/data necessary for successful mission execution. Refer to
   Attachment 3 for further guidance.
      3.4.1.1. Identify MEFs. Prioritize MEFs based on the impact of interruption and degree
      of acceptable interruption.
      3.4.1.2. Identify leadership, personnel, facilities, equipment, computer and
      communication technologies, supplies and/or other resources necessary to execute each
      MEF.
   3.4.2. Orders of Succession and/or Delegation of Authority.
      3.4.2.1. Plan for order of succession and/or delegation of authority in the event a
      disruption renders leadership unavailable or incapable of executing their responsibilities
      and/or exercising their authorities.
      3.4.2.2. Commanders will establish, promulgate, and maintain orders of succession and
      delegation of authority for key positions. Orders of succession are an essential part of
      organizations‘ continuity plans and should have sufficient breadth, depth and geographic
      dispersal, where feasible.
      3.4.2.3. Procedures and conditions for delegation of authority must be documented in
      COOP plans and should indicate the extent and limits of the delegated authority. The
      description of the conditions for implementation should include specific ‗triggers‘ for
      when the permission to act for the principal may be used as well as when that permission
      is no longer authorized.
   3.4.3. Key Personnel.
      3.4.3.1. Identify key military, civilian and contractor positions with COOP
      responsibilities under normal and emergency procedures. Ensure position descriptions
      and contract statements of work clearly reflect COOP requirements.

      3.4.3.2. Establish alert and notification procedures for key personnel. Ensure others are
      available through recall procedures to augment key personnel. Develop accountability
      procedures for all AF personnel.
      3.4.3.3. Establish force health protection standards for key and other personnel.
      Incorporate disease containment guidelines in COOP plans.
      3.4.3.4. Ensure compliance with reporting requirements outlined in AFI 10-205,
      Availability of Key HQ AF Personnel and Major Command Commanders.
      3.4.3.5. Establish Counter Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (C-CBRN)
      protection measures for key and other personnel, such as masks, suits, antidotes, etc. or
      expedited decontamination processes.
  3.4.4. Communication and Data/Vital Records. Minimum requirements include secure and
  non-secure voice, data, video and fax as specified for the primary facility or as modified by
  higher headquarters directives.
      3.4.4.1. COOP plans should provide military specific equipment (i.e. common access
      card (CAC) readers) to military, civilians or contractors to perform work as required.
      Home Use Programs (HUPs) provide another method of assisting telework procedures.
      3.4.4.2. Establish procedures for fly-away kits which contain critical office items/records
      that cannot be pre-positioned.           Ensure compliance with Personally Identifiable
      Information (PII), American Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
      (HIPAA) and other Information Assurance standards, if electronic media are used in fly-
      away kits. Include copies of delegations of authority in the vital records and ensure they
      are available at all continuity facilities in the event the continuity plan is activated.
      3.4.4.3. Establish courier procedures.
      3.4.4.4. Establish procedures to distribute Government Emergency Telecommunications
      Service (GETS) cards, as required. (http://gets.ncs.gov/index.html)
      3.4.4.5. Establish procedures to distribute handheld communication devices, computers,
      etc.
  3.4.5. Transportation. Develop transportation plans for moving personnel to relocation sites
  and sustaining operations, if required.
      3.4.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Transportation of AFSOC assets will be accomplished
      through established processes i.e., TMO/Installation Deployment Plan.
  3.4.6. Facilities.
      3.4.6.1. MEFs are most efficiently executed from the primary operating location.
      Commanders should develop procedures and risk mitigation strategies to continue
      operations at the primary location for all MEFs. Implement force protection, physical
      security or other means to enhance operational capability. Disease containment and
      contamination avoidance measures should also be considered when appropriate to the
      threat.
      3.4.6.2. Establish shelter-in-place and relocation capability, as a minimum.
      3.4.6.3. Designate alternate facilities for MEF execution.
AFI10-208_AFSOCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                           25


          3.4.6.3.1. Ensure sufficient space, infrastructure, power, life support and network
          connectivity is available. Ensure power, life support and network connectivity are not
          provided through the same pathways and systems as the primary location. Establish
          procedures for maintaining alternate facilities in a minimum readiness state and pre-
          position unique equipment and supplies as necessary. Establish memorandum of
          agreement/understanding, as required. Refer to AFI 25-201, Support Agreements
          Procedures, for additional guidance.
          3.4.6.3.2. Designated alternate facilities can include virtual office options, such as
          telework and/or AWS. Apply telecommuting and AWS policies and procedures.
          3.4.6.3.3. Develop procedures for initial activation of relocation sites and for
          continuity staff to perform when alternate work location or telework is implemented.
          This may include testing communication systems, performing accountability checks
          and preparing and transmitting status and situation reports.
          3.4.6.3.4. Develop procedures to procure equipment and supplies ―just in time‖ that
          are not pre-positioned at alternate facilities.
       3.4.6.4. MEFs can be transferred to another organization provided execution timelines
       are met. When MEFs are transferred, COOP plans should include provisions for
       resumption of MEF by the primary staff from an alternate location. Establish
       memorandum of agreement/understanding between organizations.
       3.4.6.5. Disease containment may require other strategies, such as social distancing
       which can be achieved through split shifts, telework, AWS and/or dispersing personnel
       within available work space or to alternate facilities.
   3.4.7. Return to Normal Operations and Reconstitution. Establish plans for return to normal
   operations and/or reconstitution.
       3.4.7.1. For PMEFs and MEFs, plan options for return to normal operations and
       reconstitution regardless of the level of disruption that originally prompted COOP
       execution. This may include moving operations from the continuity or devolution
       location to either the original operating facility or, if necessary, to a new operating
       facility.
       3.4.7.2. Verify that all systems, communications, and other required capabilities are
       available and operational and that the facility is fully capable of accomplishing all
       essential functions and operations.
3.5. Risk Mitigation.
   3.5.1. Apply risk mitigation methodologies during the Readiness and Preparedness/Normal
   Operations Phase to mitigate risk to MEF execution. Refer to Attachment 4 of this AFI for
   further information.
   3.5.2. Plans should place increased planning emphasis on the events most likely to occur and
   which will most likely degrade operations beyond acceptable limits.

  3.6.1. Readiness and Preparedness / Normal Operations Phase. During normal daily
  operations, COOP readiness should ensure identification and protection of
  successors/military authority, accuracy of personnel accountability and readiness of
  relocation sites. As information and intelligence increase the likelihood of an event or other
  disrpution, every effort should be made to plan or implement pre-emptive relocation or
  establish an initial operating capability for critical missions and assets at alternate sites. This
  could also include sending non-essential personnel home as a means of dispersal.
  3.6.2. Activation and Relocation Phase (0-12 hours). This phase begins when operations at
  the primary facility can no longer support MEF execution. During this phase, give priority to
  military operations (including logistical support), continuing Command, Control,
  Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4 ISR) functions,
  transferring personnel and computer data/applications necessary to support operations,
  personnel accountability and damage and residual resource assessment and reporting.
  3.6.3. Alternate Operating Facility Operation Phase. This phase commences with full MEF
  execution with a focus on military operations, communications, transportation, performing
  other essential functions, resource recovery and reconstituting forces. Affected organizations
  should notify command and control agencies of manpower and capability at alternate
  locations.    Refer to AFI 10-206, for reporting requirements. Address the restoration of
  command staffs, capabilities, and functions as resources and operational tasks permit.
  3.6.4. Return to Normal Operations Phase. This phase begins when an appropriate authority
  directs the return to normal operations. During this phase, begin implementing plans to
  resume normal operations. Supervise an orderly return to the normal operating facilities, or
  movement to a temporary or permanent facility. Maintain communication with Command
  and Control (C2) agencies during transition and report mission manpower and capability.

Terms
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and
property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and
civilian forces. AT is one element of Force Protection. (JP 1-02).
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command
and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing,
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command and Control Systems (C2 Systems)—The facilities, equipment, communications,
procedures, and personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling
operations of assigned and attached forces pursuant to the missions assigned.
Continuity of Government—A coordinated effort within each Branch of Government ensuring
the capability to continue Branch minimum essential responsibilities in a catastrophic crisis.
Continuity of Government is dependent on effective continuity of operations plans and
 36                                               AFI10-208_AFSOCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


capabilities. DOD Continuity of Government activities involve ensuring continuity of DOD MEF
through plans and procedures governing succession to office; emergency delegations of authority
(where permissible, and in accordance with applicable law); the safekeeping of vital resources,
facilities, and records; the improvisation or emergency acquisition of vital resources necessary
for the performance of MEF; and the capability to relocate essential personnel and functions to,
and sustain performance of MEF at, alternate work site(s) until normal operations can be
resumed.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—An internal effort within individual components of the
Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches of Government assuring the capability exists to
continue uninterrupted essential component functions across a wide range of potential
emergencies, including local or regional natural disasters, health-related emergencies, accidents,
and technological and/or attack-related emergencies. COOP involves plans and capabilities
covering the same functional objectives of Continuity of Government, must be maintained at a
high level of readiness, and be capable of implementation both with and without warning. COOP
is not only an integral part of Continuity of Government and Enduring Constitutional
Government (ECG), but is simply "good business practice" - part of the Department of Defense's
fundamental mission as a responsible and reliable public institution.
Crisis—An incident or situation involving a threat to the United States, its territories, citizens,
military forces, possessions, or vital interests that develops rapidly and creates a condition of
such diplomatic, economic, political, or military importance that commitment of U.S. military
forces and resources is contemplated to achieve national objectives.
Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP)—USAF CIP/CARM is a mission assurance, risk
management program. The goal is to assure availability of assets/infrastructure critical to DoD
and AF missions. These include both operational and Title 10 missions and capabilities. The
Program identifies critical assets inside and outside the fence line, mission ―impact‖ caused by
critical asset loss/degradation, and focuses on theater/global impact vs. local impact. It supports
risk management –identifies risk to the asset and impact to the mission.
Defense Continuity Executive Steering Group (Continuity ESG)—Senior representatives
from designated OSD Components, Joint Staff, Military Services, and Defense Agencies that
serve as the "board of directors" for the DCP to provide guidance and oversight for DOD
continuity-related activities, while developing and implementing a DOD-wide continuity strategy
for the twenty-first century threat environment. The Continuity ESG also adjudicates functional
disputes concerning the use of common DOD continuity resources that support the Secretary of
Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Defense Continuity Program (DCP)—An integrated program comprised of defense policies,
plans, procedures, assets, and resources that ensures continuity of DOD Component MEF under
all circumstances, including crisis, attack, recovery, and reconstitution. It encompasses the DOD
Components performing Continuity of Operations, Continuity of Government, and Enduring
Constitutional Government functions across the spectrum of threats to continuity.
Devolution— is the capability to transfer statutory authority and/or responsibility for essential
functions from an agency‘s primary operating staff and facilities to other agency employees and
facilities, and to sustain that operational capability for an extended period.

Force Protection (FP)—Members Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against
DOD personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.
These actions conserve the force‗s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and
place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to
enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents,
weather, or disease. Also called FP (JP 1-02). Note: The Air Force defines FP as the process of
detecting threats and hazards to the Air Force and its mission, and applying measures to deter,
pre-empt, negate or mitigate them based on an acceptable level of risk.] (AFDD 3-10)
{Italicized definition in brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.}
Emergency Relocation Staff (ERS)—Members directly supporting uninterrupted operational
capability and COOP execution.
Information Assurance (IA)—Information operations that protect and defend information and
information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and
non-repudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating
protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.
Integrated Defense (ID)—Integrated Defense is the application of active and passive defense
measures, employed across the legally-defined ground dimension of the operational
environment, to mitigate potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force operations.
Also called ID. (AFPD 31-1)

emergency. These functions must directly support the NEFs and must be submitted/approved by
OSD.
Reconstitution—The rebuilding of an organization by relocating selected personnel from
subordinate organizations to a designated location to assume the mission essential functions
performed by the higher-level organization.
Reconstitution Site—A location selected by the surviving organization as the site at which a
damaged or destroyed function can be reformed by survivors of the event/emergency and
personnel from other sources, designated as replacements.
Relocation Site—The site selected by an organization that is capable of supporting the logistics
and communications necessary to continue an organization‘s mission essential functions.
Vital Records—Records essential to the continued functioning or reconstitution of an
organization during and after an emergency and also those records essential to protecting the
rights and interests of that organization and of the individuals directly affected by its activities.
Sometimes called essential records. Include both emergency-operating and rights-and-interests
records. Vital records considerations are part of an agency‘s records disaster prevention and
recovery program.

                 DEVELOPING AF MISSION ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS

Prior to writing continuity plans, organizations should complete a thorough analysis of the
mission and functions of the organization, supporting activities, communications, and vital
records/data necessary for successful mission execution.
A4.1. Identify the Mission Essential Function(s). Mission Essential Functions are derived
from, but not limited to, the following sources: DOD directive or instruction, AF policy
directives or instruction, MAJCOM or locally developed instructions, CCDR plans, i.e. concept
plans (CONPLAN), operational plan (OPLAN), tasks assigned through the Defense Readiness
and Reporting System (DRRS) in support of CCDRs or HAF, any memorandum of
understanding (MOUs) or memorandum of agreements (MOAs) or other agreements, and the
organization‘s mission statement. MEFs should provide overarching answers to questions, such
as, what function or service does this organization provide to the Air Force and/or DOD?
   A4.1.1. Mission Essential Tasks do not readily equate to MEFs. Functions should generally
   describe an activity required to achieve a desired goal, mission or organizational
   responsibility. The responsibility has been designated or delegated by higher authority.
   Tasks usually are more specific and may generally contribute to the performance of a
   function.
   A4.1.2. An example of a MEF may be, ―Ensure Air Force forces are continuously available
   to conduct CONUS air superiority.‖ This function implies a series of tasks, some which may
   not be readily defined in readiness reporting systems. Response times should be derived
   from higher headquarters.
A4.2. Identify interdependencies necessary to support MEF execution. Interdependencies
can be within and/or outside an organization or installation. Additionally, break the MEF into
subordinate elements or tasks necessary to accomplish the function. For example, an
organization may be tasked to launch F-22s to assist in maintaining air superiority. This task
requires aircraft with crews and maintainers, logistics, security and extensive mission support. A
headquarters staff function may need to provide situational awareness and analysis of the data to
a commander in support of decision-making.
   A4.2.1. Identify the subordinate elements or tasks/services necessary to execute the function.
   Some additional supporting elements may include situational awareness, computer and
   information support staff, and administrative management.
   A4.2.2. Identify any service, equipment, leaders and staff, facilities, communication
   capability, data/information, or other supporting infrastructure necessary to perform the
   function. Areas to consider, but not limited to, include: command and control, command
   decisions and strategies, crisis communications (including alerts and notifications), crisis data
   storage, retrieval and security, legal obligations, fiscal and contractual obligations, and
   personnel.
A4.3. Identify the impact and consequences over time should these functions not be
performed. This should establish the acceptable degree of interruption in the MEF execution
during a crisis.
AFI10-208_AFSOCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                           45


   A4.3.1. Determine what higher order MEF and/or organization this function supports.
   A4.3.2. Assess the impact and consequences over time if these functions fail.
      A4.3.2.1. Assess the maximum time period a function can be suspended without
      consequences.
      A4.3.2.2. Assess the minimum functional level that must be achieved upon resumption.
      A4.3.2.3. Assess the length of time normal functional levels must be achieved.
      A4.3.2.4. Contact the organizations which the function supports for guidance in
      determining the acceptable degree of interruption. For example, contact Wing Plans
      offices for response requirements outlined in OPLANS. MAJCOMs should provide
      guidance to subordinate organizations on OPLAN response requirements.
A4.4. Prioritize organizational MEFs, based on information above.
   A4.4.1. MEFs – broader set of essential functions – must be continued throughout or
   resumed rapidly after normal activities are disrupted. These enable the Air Force to execute
   vital missions and services, maintain safety, and sustain the industrial/economic base during
   disruption of normal operations. This includes incident management responsibilities.
      A4.4.1.1. Primary MEFs (PMEFs) must directly support the National Essential
      Functions (NEFs), execute before, during and in the aftermath of an emergency and be
      performed continuously or resumed within 12 hours of an event and maintained up to 30
      days after an event or until normal operations can be resumed. PMEFs must be submitted
      and approved by OSD.
      A4.4.1.1.1. MEFs must be performed continuously or resumed within 12 hours of an
      event and maintained up to 30 days after an event or until normal operations can be
      resumed.
   A4.4.2. Business Continuity MEFs – Support activities that should be continued or resumed
   whenever practical after a disruption of normal activities, but can accept a delay or minimal
   operating capability.
A4.5. Identify the connection between the higher headquarters MEF this organization
MEF supports.

                           RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

A5.1. Apply risk management principles to all continuity planning elements. Risk
management identifies, controls and minimizes the impact of uncertain events. This process
supports the overarching Continuity Program Management Cycle by identifying (1) the critical
risks to organizational readiness and (2) the strategies that best mitigate the risks. Commanders
should apply risk management principles to guide decisions about when, where, and how to
invest in resources that eliminate, control or mitigate mission risk. Continuity strategies should
seek to improve resilience to mission disruption by ensuring critical MEFs continue at, or are
recovered to, an acceptable minimum level and within acceptable timeframes.
   A5.1.1. Risk assessments performed through other mission assurance programs, such as the
   Critical Asset Risk Assessment (CARA) may be applied to build a COOP risk assessment.
   A5.1.2. Risk as a function of threats, vulnerabilities and consequences is a permanent
   condition.
   A5.1.3. Reviewing an organization‘s risks and risk management programs must consider
   additional factors such as mission/function impact, threat/hazard, and vulnerability
   assessments.
   A5.1.4. Further, cost may also be a factor to consider, because informed decisions about
   acceptable and unacceptable risk levels will ultimately drive the resources expenditures (i.e.,
   money, people, and time) to mitigate risk.
   A5.1.5. Risk can never be fully mitigated; no organization can afford to counter every threat
   to its mission. Successful continuity planning demands an intelligent analysis and
   prioritization of where and when to focus resources and apply funding or other assets.
   A5.1.6. A continuity threat assessment integrates a historical review of past events that have
   affected normal operations (e.g., natural disasters; disruptions of communication, power, and
   other utilities; threats to public safety) with a dynamic analysis of other potential threats,
   such as acts of terrorism (from both foreign and domestic agents) and war.
   A5.1.7. This process supports the overarching Continuity Program Management Cycle by
   identifying (1) the critical risks to organizational readiness and (2) the strategies that best
   mitigate the risks.
   A5.1.8. The recommended risk management cycle is made up of four analytical and
   management phases. The following sections describe the key elements that an organization‘s
   analysis team should address in each of the phase.
A5.2. Phase 1 – Risk Assessment. Answer the following three questions: (1) what can go
wrong, (2) what is the likelihood that the undesired event might occur, and (3) what would be the
impact should it occur? Critical steps in this phase include:
   A5.2.1. Prioritize the organizational MEFs. Fundamental to this evaluation is the criteria
   used to measure MEF value or the consequence of loss. Consequences should be evaluated
   as an inability to execute the MEF, consider both short- and long-term impacts as well as
   intended and unintended effects from threats/hazards.
AFI10-208_AFSOCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                               47


   A5.2.2. Identify the threat-hazards that can impact delivery of the critical functions. Threat is
   the likelihood that an event or other disruption will occur. This step would include exploring
   potential natural events, intentional man-made events, and unintentional man-made events
   that could adversely affect the ability of the organization to perform MEFs. Natural hazards
   are those where the occurrence is beyond the control of the organization, including
   earthquakes, floods, ice storms, winter weather, and external fires. Intentional man-made
   hazards are also beyond the direct control of the organization and could include events such
   as external sabotage, and terrorism. Unintentional man-made events, such as power outages,
   fires, explosions, equipment failures, or human errors may or may not be within the
   organization control.
   A5.2.3. Assess the Vulnerability. Develop the vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability is the
   likelihood that an event or other disruption would succeed, or that the event will result in the
   expected level of consequence.               To identify vulnerabilities assess existing
   safeguards/countermeasures in place to reduce either the likelihood (e.g., security
   countermeasures) or consequence (e.g., redundant capabilities) of the hazard. Identify
   existing safeguards/countermeasures. Identify the existing safeguards that are in place to
   reduce either the likelihood (e.g., security countermeasures) or consequence (e.g., redundant
   capabilities) of the hazard. Utilize CARA after-action reports, vulnerability assessments or
   IDRMP reports and the impact of other mission assurance plans.
A5.3. Phase 2 – Strategic Goals, Objectives, and Constraints. This phase involves
establishing the scope and structure of the risk-informed decision making process. Critical steps
in this phase include:
   A5.3.1. Understand and define the decision. For this effort, the critical question is: How
   should I invest my limited resources across the four continuity pillars – leadership, staff,
   facilities and communications – to ensure that my organization satisfies its continuity
   requirements?
   A5.3.2. Determine who should be involved. Incorporate those who should be involved in the
   decision-making and those who will be affected by actions resulting from the process. Input
   from higher headquarters and commanders are essential to a sound risk management process.
   A5.3.3. Identify the factors that will influence the decisions. The decision to invest resources
   for meeting continuity requirements is not based on only one factor. Decision makers must
   simultaneously weigh multiple factors, including costs, timelines, and risks.
A5.4. Phase 3 – Evaluation of Alternates. For many events, the current risk may be
considered to be at an acceptable level. For those events where the current level of risk is deemed
to be unacceptable, take risk mitigation action. Critical steps in this phase include:
   A5.4.1. Develop alternate risk management strategies. Engage the appropriate decision-
   makers to determine how the risks for each event can be managed most effectively. These
   alternate strategies should be completely developed and documented by addressing all
   critical factors (e.g., cost, schedule).
   A5.4.2. Assess the risk impact of the proposed strategies. The analysis team should reassess

   provide the risk reduction value of each of the alternate strategies.

A5.5. Phase 4 – Management Selection.
   A5.5.1. Once the alternative strategies are fully developed and their risk reduction value has
   been quantified, the process moves to the selection phase. During this phase, decision
   makers choose alternatives for implementation. The alternatives will be evaluated based on
   consideration of all of the previously identified critical factors, including effectiveness (risk
   reduction), efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
   A5.5.2. Another critical factor that should be considered is the confidence or belief that the
   alternative will achieve the projected level of performance. The effect of many of the
   alternative strategies may be well understood by the organization. For instance, these
   alternatives may have a proven track record of performance within other similar
   organizations, or they may have been extensively studied, as part of another program, such as
   CIP/CARM through a completed CARA.
