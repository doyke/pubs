      The Information Security Program is established on Goodfellow AFB (GAFB) with the
     17th Training Wing Information Protection Office (17 TRW/IP) as the OPR and is the point
     of contact for all matters pertaining to information security on GAFB.
            1.3.4.5. The 17 TRW/IP office will conduct semiannual security manager meetings
            in January and July of each year and when a meeting is necessary.
            1.3.5.1. Unit commanders or staff agency chiefs will appoint an activity security

        natural disaster, bomb threat, and civil disturbance. Collateral material procedures
        will be filed in the front of the locking drawer of the safe. Emergency action cards
        will be developed from the procedures. A set of cards will identify required actions
        for each emergency. They should be quick, to the point, and easily understood.
        Multiple cards give others the possibility to assist without duplicating effort. The
        cards will be posted near the safe. Review and document the review of the
        emergency procedures at least annually. Personnel who normally work in the same
        area as the safe should have a working knowledge of emergency procedures/cards.
        These procedures will be coordinated through 17 TRW/IP and 17 CES/CEF prior to
        implementation.
        5.9.3.2. (Added) Safes with both Communications Security (COMSEC) material

        COMSEC and collateral classified material in case of fire, natural disaster, bomb
        threat, and civil disturbance. These procedures will be coordinated through 17
        TRW/IP, 17 CES/CEF, and 17 CS/SCXS COMSEC account manager.
        5.9.3.3. (Added) Safes maintaining COMSEC material, but no collateral classified

        natural disaster, and bomb threat, but a civil disturbance plan is not required.
        COMSEC emergency action plans (EAP) are required to be kept in the COMSEC
        continuity book and posted as cards on the outside of the safe or near the COMSEC
        material. Each set of procedures will explain, with a reasonable amount of detail,
        what actions are needed and why. EAP will be coordinated through 17 CS/SCXS
        COMSEC account manager.
     5.12.1. The 17 TRW/CP will notify the 17 TRG/SSO of any requirements to secure SCI
     for transient personnel. The 17 TRG/SSO provides temporary storage of Sensitive

     Command Post (17 TRW/CP) provides temporary storage for all other classified material.
     The following applies to classified material temporarily stored by the 17 TRW/CP.
     Couriers of classified material will be directed to the Emergency Control Center (ECC).

     5.18.5. (Added) COMSEC material will be maintained according to COMSEC
     publications. COMSEC and collateral material may be maintained in the same safe but
     not in the same drawer. COMSEC will not be maintained in the locking drawer.

     Personnel without COMSEC access will not have the combination to the safe. 17
     TRW/IP is not authorized to inspect COMSEC material. COMSEC manager is not
     authorized to inspect collateral material. All personnel with access to the safe will be
     familiar with access, maintenance, and inspection practices.
