    Flight to ensure the unit is aware of all procedures to purchase the unit-funded AED. All 374
    AW AEDs will be logged into DMLSS by the Medical Logistics Flight.
    4.2. Maintenance: The 374 MDG MERC will conduct annual maintenance, address any
    mechanical problems found by the site coordinators, and inspect all AEDs after their use on a
    victim. After an event, MERC will download the event recording from the AED (if
    applicable) and offer a temporary loaner AED, if available. Any AED maintenance repair
    costs will be assessed by MERC and charged to the unit. The Medical Logistics flight will
    work closely with unit AED coordinators if an AED is recalled.
    4.3. Location: The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early defibrillation. Therefore,
    AEDs must be strategically placed throughout the organization based upon the time to initial
    shock of a victim of SCD. AEDs should be placed in facilities to ensure timely response for
    a medical emergency. Factors considered in determining Wing approved locations for AED
    placement included the following:
       4.3.1. Facility size and or accessibility.
       4.3.2. Number of employees in the facility.
       4.3.3. Identified high-risk environments.
       4.3.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
       4.3.5. Average age of the facility occupants.
       4.3.6. Incidence of heart disease given the population at hand.
       4.3.7. Emergency response protocol that may already be in place for your facility,
       keeping in mind that it is the time to initial shock that really matters.
    4.4. Wing approved locations of AEDs on the base are designated in Attachment 7. There
    are numerous other locations which have self-procured units. These locations are tracked by
    the HAWC.

         TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) PROGRAM INFORMATION

A6.1. What is TSR program? It is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention designed to
assist individuals and groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist events,
suicides, death - either accidental or intentional.)
A6.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services? Many types of events have
the potential to produce individual and community traumatic stress. Events include: large scale
disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small scale disasters (suicide, death or near-
death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after
traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events. The goal is to assist those
affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner.
These actions are intended to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or
mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A6.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services? The office of record for TSR
services is the Life Skills Support Center (225-3566). Please address any inquiries about TSR
services to the Chief of the TSR team.
