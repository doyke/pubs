SUMMARY OF CHANGES

1. Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances.
1. 1. Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances are vehicles that do not meet the
definition of Government Motor Vehicles, Government Vehicles Others, All Terrain Vehicles,
Motorcycles, or Low-Speed Vehicles and are not in full compliance with the Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standard. Prior to units purchasing Other Government Motor Vehicle
Conveyances , the 20 FW Ground Safety Office will review each purchase request in accordance
with Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-210, Contract Safety, paragraph 7.1.4.
 2                                                   SHAWAFBI 91-207 10 DECEMBER 2014


        1.1.1. Use will be restricted to roads with a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less.
        Prior to operating Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances on the roadways, a
        written Risk Management (RM) evaluation using an AF Form 4437, Deliberate Risk
        Management Worksheet, will be conducted and meet the minimum requirements
        outlined in AFI 91-207. As a minimum, the RM worksheet will be signed by the
        squadron commander. Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances will not be
        operated on Shaw Drive; Frierson Road; Patrol Road; Lance Ave or Sweeney Road
        during the hours of 0645-0800 and 1545-1700. If mission essential requirements dictate
        Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances be utilized on the above named roads
        during the above listed hours, the squadron commander will ensure a Government Motor
        Vehicle (sedan or truck) accompanies and provides escort services to the Other
        Government Motor Vehicle Conveyance. Both the Government Motor Vehicle and the
        Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances will travel in the right hand lane (if
        available) and will activate the vehicle flashers to increase visibility.
2. Land Mobile Radio /Cell Phone Use.
     2.1. Vehicle operators of government owned, leased, or rented vehicles on and off Shaw
     AFB are permitted to use issued Land Mobile Radios (LMRs) while the vehicle is in motion
     for the performance of their prescribed duties. This includes cellular phones and other
     devices, used only in push-to-talk (walkie-talkie, direct connection) mode if required and
     issued for the performance of official duties. Prior to using LMRs in this manner, the vehicle
     operator will evaluate the operating environment to ensure it is safe to do so.
2.2. Vehicle operators of government owned, leased, or rented vehicles on and off Shaw
AFB will find a safe location and place their vehicle in park prior to using a hand held
electronic device. Privately Owned Vehicle operators on Shaw AFB will find a safe location
and place their vehicle in park prior to using a hand held electronic device. Privately Owned
Vehicle operators off base are highly encouraged to make every effort to find a safe location and
place their vehicle in park when using a non hands-free device.

3. Motorcycle Requirements.
     3.1. All riders will carry their motorcycle course completion card, or a copy of the card on
     their person at all times when operating their motorcycle on Shaw AFB.
4. Exposure to Vehicular Traffic.
     4.1. Personnel are strongly encouraged to use the various running trails on Shaw AFB
     instead of roadways for the purposes of physical training or exercise. When unit formation
     runs are conducted on the roadways of Shaw AFB, the unit conducting the run will be
     required to complete a written risk assessment, utilizing an AF Form 4437 prior to
     conducting the formation run. Particular attention will be paid to traffic density and traffic
     flow patterns during the risk assessment. All risk assessments will be reviewed and approved
     by the unit commander as a minimum. Under no circumstances will traffic flow be
     interrupted during the formation run. Unit formation runs will utilize road guards and/or
     safety spotters when crossing any roads. When on roadways without a sidewalk, personnel
     will walk opposite the direction of vehicle traffic. Bicycle riders will travel in the same
     direction as vehicle traffic and follow the Installation Traffic Code.

5. Distracted Driving and Motorcycle Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Checks.
   5.1. The 20 FW safety office will periodically (as determined by the Chief of Safety or
   Ground Safety Manager) conduct seatbelt/distracted driving checks (i.e. cell phone, texting,
   etc.) and motorcycle PPE checks. Security Forces will accompany, mission requirements
   permitting, to issue citations to traffic code violators. Results of these checks will be
   presented at the Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Council.
6. Transportation in Vehicles without Fixed Seating.
   6.1. To the maximum extent possible, vehicle occupants will ride in areas of a vehicle with
   fixed seats. If circumstances require that personnel be transported in vehicles without fixed
   seating, the following will apply:
      6.1.1. The unit will complete a written risk assessment which will be approved by the
      unit commander. The risk assessment will remain on file as long as the unit utilizes
      vehicles without fixed seating.
      6.1.2. Transport is limited to short distances on DoD installations only and the vehicle
      cargo area will not have any open sides.
      6.1.3. Passengers must remain seated on the bed of the vehicle and no person is resting
      against a side area or gate that may open.
