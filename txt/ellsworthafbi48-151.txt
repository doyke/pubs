This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 48-1, Aerospace Medicine
Program, and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 48-151, Thermal Injury. This instruction
establishes Ellsworth Air Force Base (EAFB) responsibilities and procedures to prevent the
adverse effects of thermal stress and applies to all personnel assigned to EAFB and all tenant
units. It does not apply to contractor personnel or personnel on off-duty time using areas such as
the fitness center or golf course. It establishes policies and rules for non-flying operations during
periods of extremely hot and cold weather. It establishes Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)
monitoring and reporting procedures, heat stress conditions and notifications, cold stress
conditions and notifications, clothing and hydration requirements, and work/rest cycles. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

1. General. During mission essential, contingency, or emergency operations, commanders,
upon receiving counsel from 28 MDOS/SGPB, may waive the provisions of this instruction;
however, when commanders waive procedures they must ensure all supervisors exercise caution,
make certain all subordinate personnel are aware of heat and cold injury symptoms, and take
actions to protect the health of their personnel. Tables A3.1, A3.2, and A4.2 are the
recommended work activity restrictions based on climatic conditions for this geographical area.

        changes, a new Cold Stress Advisory will be issued IAW paragraph 3.3.
        2.2.4. Upon request, during non-routine activities (i.e., change of command ceremonies,
        parades, and readiness exercises) 28 MDOS/SGPB will monitor localized WBGT at site
        of non-routine activities and determine the Heat Stress Condition.
        2.2.5. Ensure thermal stress readings and guidance are available 8 hours a day during the
        duty week, and as needed in support of after hours and weekend operations/exercises at
        the request of unit commanders.
        2.2.6. Call the 28th Bomb Wing Command Post (28 BW/CP) with the current WBGT
        reading and thermals stress condition so they can prepare and forward advisory messages
        to the entire base.

        job safety training outline. Classify all industrial shops as being high, medium, or low
        risk of thermal stress. Conduct health risk assessments in workplaces as needed.
        2.2.8. Investigate all thermal stress illnesses documented on AF IMT 190, Occupational
        Illness/Injury Report.
        2.2.9. Develop an office operating instruction detailing procedures for determining
        WBGT measurements and heat/cold stress conditions.

         3.1.10.1. Supervisors of occupationally exposed personnel will use Tables A3.1 and
         A3.2 to plan work and rest cycles for individuals under their control. When the
         WBGT index reaches the temperatures shown in the attachment for the category of
         workload, supervisors will initiate the appropriate work rest regimen and ensure the
         proper water intake.
     3.1.10.2 Heat Stress Conditions provide guidance to workplace supervisors in order to
     reduce heat stress injuries. The WBGT Index should not be used directly for operations
     requiring heavy personal protective equipment (PPE) or hot indoor operations. Use
     correction factors for PPE from Attachment 3.
         3.1.10.3. Exposures above 90o F WBGT should be allowed only when performing
         mission essential duties and only then with caution.
         3.1.10.4. When necessary to accomplish a task, two or more details should be
         arranged to work in sequence to ensure each crew receives the proper work and rest
         cycle.
  3.2. Cold Stress:
     3.2.1. 28 OSS/OSW will monitor temperature and wind speed information and update
     the current weather information on their web site.
     3.2.2. 28 MDOS/SGPB will monitor cold stress routinely during the winter months. The
     winter monitoring period will typically begin around Thanksgiving and end around the
     first of March. (The winter monitoring period may be increased or decreased based on
     seasonal variations.)
     3.2.3. When predicted or forecasted temperatures fall to 30 oF, 28 MDOS/ SGPB will
     gather information every two hours during the duty day from 28 OSS/OSW and update
     the cold stress condition and equivalent chill temperature (ECT) on the EAFB CoP.

       personnel of Cold Stress Advisories and associated precautions
       3.2.6. During duty hours, direct questions to 28 MDOS/ SGPB or web site. After duty
       hours, emergency cold stress items will be directed to 28 MDOS/ SGPB technician on-
       call via     28 BW/CP at 385-3800.
       3.2.7. Guidelines for Occupational Cold Exposures:
           3.2.7.1. Supervisors of occupationally exposed personnel will use Tables A4.1 and
           A4.2 to plan work/warming cycles for their personnel and implement cold weather
           precautions. Supervisors will ensure proper cold weather gear is available and is
           utilized by personnel.
           3.2.7.2. Exposures below -45 F ECT should be allowed only when performing
           mission critical duties.
           3.2.7.3. When necessary to accomplish a task, two or more details should be
           arranged to work in sequence to ensure each crew receives the proper work/warming
           cycle and use the buddy system.
    3.3. When notified of any thermal stress conditions listed in Table A3.1 or Table A4.2, the
    28 BW/CP will immediately disseminate a Thermal Stress Advisory. Personnel operating
    outside the thermal stress restrictions may only do so at the direction of the Unit Commander
    or his/her representative. Thermal stress warning conditions remain unchanged.
    3.4. Contact 28 MDOS/ SGPB at 385-3172 for any thermal stress questions.

Terms:
Acclimatization—. Period of adjustment individual’s body requires becoming accustomed to
working in hot environments. Full acclimatization occurs through progressive degrees of heat
exposure and physical exertion. Personnel may need two weeks of increasing exposure to
become substantially acclimated and may retain most of their adaptation for one week after
leaving hot climate. Workers in good physical condition acclimatize more quickly.
Buddy System. When implemented, two persons (minimum) must be present during the
performance of each open—weather task. Each individual will monitor the other for symptoms
of frostbite, hypothermia, or other cold-related injuries.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)—. The WBGT index is a combination of temperature
measurements, which consider dry air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant heating. The
equation for the WBGT index uses dry bulb (DB) temperatures, natural wet bulb (NWB)
temperatures, and globe (GT) temperatures. "Heat Stress Index" is synonymous with "WBGT
Index."
