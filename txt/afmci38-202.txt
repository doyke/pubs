OPR: HQ AFMC/XPMR (Cliff Hensel)                      Certified by: HQ AFMC/XPM (Col Ron Sullivan)
                                                                                        Pages: 11
                                                                                   Distribution: F

This instruction provides guidance and procedures for implementing portions of AFPD 38-2, Manpower.
This instruction provides operating procedures for the allocation of colonel grades within AFMC. It is
applicable both to the Centers and to HQ AFMC Directorates. This instruction applies to all AFMC orga-
nizations. It does not apply to the Air National Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and members.



1. Position Description (PD) (AF Form 81, Colonel Position Description).
   1.1. The PD is the basic document to be used in managing AFMCâ€™s core colonels. Particular care
   must be taken to assure that it is accurate and complete, and adequately describes the duties and
   responsibilities of the position, as well as its organizational placement. It should also indicate clearly
   whether there is a GM-15 deputy. Since the PD is used, in addition to the process described below,
   to obtain qualified individuals for assignment, its importance is paramount. It should be reviewed
   periodically and updated if necessary. Organizational realignments and/or changes in duties and
   responsibilities should be documented with new PDs. Updated PDs should be submitted to HQ
   AFMC/XPMR, along with an abbreviated Organizational Chart showing the placement of the colonel
   and one organizational level above and one level below that block.
   1.2. PD Certification. AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements, indicates that colonel PDs
   should be signed, certifying the position as a valid colonel requirement. All PD updates, and PDs
   accompanying requests for core billet realignment or for new core billets, will be submitted for certi-
   fication. HQ AFMC staff elements will review the PD.
       1.2.1. XPMO will check organizational placement.
       1.2.2. XPMQ will check manpower data codes such as APDP, AFSC, RPI, etc. for applicability
       to the stated mission.
       1.2.3. DPO will check compliance with applicable military personnel standards.
2                                                                        AFMCI38-202 10 JULY 2000

       1.2.4. Functional office and Business Area (BA) will verify that the PD adequately describes the
       duties and responsibilities of a mission for which a colonel is required.
       1.2.5. XPM will sign approved PDs at Section III.

2. Realignment Requests. Realignment requests are those cases where an existing authorization would
be upgraded to colonel and a current colonel core authorization would be downgraded. The billet number
would be transferred to the upgraded authorization. These requests will be considered for approval upon
receipt.
    2.1. Center Realignments. Use of colonel billets is an "execution year" activity, and Center/CCs have
    authority to determine the best use of available billets to accomplish their missions. Centers submit
    realignment requests, with PD, Organizational Chart, and Center rank and PEC of the proposed posi-
    tion, through their Manpower Office to HQ AFMC/XPM. Upon certification, and coordination by
    affected BAs and functional offices, the request is approved, and XPM authorizes the requesting Cen-
    ter to adjust their unit manpower document (UMD) accordingly.
    2.2. HQ AFMC Directorate Realignments. Directorates submit such requests, with PD, Organiza-
    tional Chart, and Directorate rank of the proposed position, to HQ AFMC/XPM. Upon certification,
    the request is approved, and XPM adjusts their UMD accordingly.

3. Ranking of Colonel Positions. In the fourth quarter of each year HQ AFMC/XPM will ask Centers
and HQ AFMC Directorates to submit colonel position rankings. These rankings will be effective for the
following fiscal year, and will include any requirements for new colonel billets within the ranking. Rank-
ings will be distributed to the BAs after receipt by XPM.

4. New Billet Requests. These are cases where no existing core billet is identified as an offset. The
requirement is in addition to core billets already authorized. By definition, these requests should be
ranked lower than any existing colonel position owned by the submitting organization. If necessary,
realignment requests should be submitted to insure the requested new billet has the lowest rank. These
requests will be acted upon (as necessary) each year, after receipt of the rankings discussed above.
    4.1. Center Requests. Centers submit such requests, with PD, Organizational Chart, and PEC of the
    proposed position, through their Manpower Office to HQ AFMC/XPM. Upon certification, the BA of
    the proposed location sources from within or as agreed with another BA. The BA may source the
    requirement with an unused billet (if available), choose another core billet within its management to
    use as the offset, or negotiate with another BA for a billet. If the BA is unable to source the new
    request, it is forwarded to the AFMC Resource Board (ARB), which will make a recommendation for
    AFMC/CC/CV. Upon resolution, XPM authorizes the involved Centers to adjust their UMDs accord-
    ingly.
    4.2. HQ AFMC Directorate Requests. Directorates submit such requests, with PD and Organiza-
    tional Chart, to HQ AFMC/XPM. Upon certification, the ARB may recommend sourcing the require-
    ment with an unused billet (if available), or choose another core billet to use as the offset. Upon CC/
    CV decision, XPM adjusts the UMD accordingly.

5. ARB Resolution Process. Upon receipt of an unsourced colonel requirement as described above, the
Program Review Panel (PRP), an O-6/GM-15 level working group of the ARB, will use the following
procedure to determine a recommendation for ARB action.
AFMCI38-202 10 JULY 2000                                                                               3

  5.1. A group of candidate colonel positions will be assembled for consideration as offsets. The BAs
  will be responsible for determining a pool of offset candidates for the Centers and XP will assemble
  the pool for HQ. In either case, the pool should be at least three times the number of new requests.
  The rankings submitted by the Centers/Directorates will be the primary basis for selection, using those
  ranked lowest.
  5.2. The PDs of candidate positions will be scored using the attached evaluation criteria, which were
  developed to match up with the colonel PD, and are consistent with the General Schedule Supervisory
  Grade Guide used to classify civilian high grades throughout federal service.
  5.3. Each working group member will score all candidate PDs. After throwing out the high and low
  scores, the average of the remaining scores will be the baseline position. Additional information may
  be used by the PRP to determine recommended options for ARB consideration.

                                       EVALUATION FACTORS
A2.1. Instructions: For each Factor (A2A1 - A2F1), determine the Level that best matches the entire
PD. When all factors have been rated total the points, including those from the Colonel Position Scoring
Key (A2G1). Factors should be scored on the basis of the PD as a whole. Centers/Directorates must con-
struct PDs to highlight levels and importance of responsibilities.
A2.1.1. Factor 1 - Supervisory And Managerial Authority. This factor covers the authorities and
management responsibilities which are exercised in the position on a recurring basis. Points assigned
under this factor apply equally to the direction of specialized program management organizations, line
functions, staff functions, and operating and support activities.
A2.1.1.1.. 1 Point Level: Plans and schedules ongoing work on a quarterly/annual basis, or directs
assignments of similar duration. Adjusts staffing levels or work procedures to accommodate resource
allocation decisions made at higher echelons. Justifies the purchase of new equipment. Improves work
methods and procedures. Oversees the development of technical data, estimates, statistics, suggestions,
and other information useful to higher level managers. Decides the methodologies to use in achieving
work goals and objectives, and in determining other management strategies. Typically provides direct
supervision over one or fewer O-6/GM-15 position.
A2.1.1.2. 2 Point Level: Exercises authority to set a series of long-range work plans and schedules for
in-service or contracted work. Assures implementation (by subordinate organizational units or others) of
the goals and objectives for the program segment(s) or function(s) they oversee. Determines goals and
objectives that need additional emphasis; determines the best approach or solution for resolving budget
shortages; and plans for long range staffing needs, including such matters as whether to contract out work.
These positions are closely involved with high level program officials (or comparable staff personnel) in
the development of overall goals and objectives. For example, they direct development of data; provision
of expertise and insights; securing of legal opinions; preparation of position papers or legislative propos-
als; and execution of comparable activities which support development of goals and objectives. Typically
provides direct supervision over two or three O-6/ GM-15 positions.
A2.1.1.3. 3 Point Level: Exercises delegated authority for the overall planning, direction, and timely exe-
cution of a program, several program segments (managed through separate subordinate organizational
units), or comparable staff functions, including development, assignment, and higher level clearance of
goals and objectives for supervisors or managers of subordinate organizational units. Approves
multi-year and longer range work plans developed by subordinate organizational units, and subsequently
manages the overall work to achieve goals and objectives. Manages policy in response to changes in lev-
els of appropriations or other legislation. Manages organizational changes throughout the organization
directed, or major change to the structure and content of the program or program segments directed.
Exercises discretionary authority to approve the allocation and distribution of funds in the organization's
budget. Exercises final authority for the full range of personnel actions (military and civilian) and organi-
zation design proposals recommended by subordinate supervisors. This level may be credited even if for-
mal clearance is required for a few actions, such as removals and incentive awards above set dollar levels.
