SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2004-1. This IC reformats, consolidates, and renumbers
information where necessary. The (Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (CTO) and Attachment 6,
Centrally Billed Account Procedures. Based on two GAO reports (GAO 04-398, Control Weaknesses Led
to Millions of Dollars Wasted on Unused Airline Tickets, and 04-88, Internal Control Weaknesses at DoD
Led to Improper Use of First and Business Class Travel) and an Air Force Audit Agency Report, Cen-
trally Billed Account (CBAs) for Travel Audit (Project F2002-FB1000-0036.000), CTO and CBA
requirements have been significantly revised. Specifically, the changes outline the new procedures the
CTOs must follow with regard to making premium class travel (PCT) accommodations and ticketing
PCT, as well as the CTO requirements pertaining to fully unused tickets and partially used tickets and
turn-in for refunds. Additionally, this change also informs the CTO that it must comply with Centrally
Billed Account (CBA) procedures in Attachment 6 of this AFI and/or as specified in the CTO contract
statement of work. Use of Premium Class Travel (PCT) Accommodations: Based on GAO Report 04-88,
Internal Control Weaknesses at DoD Led to Improper Use of First and Business Class Travel, and result-
ing DEPSECDEF/USECDEF and SAF/OS memos, PCT policy has also been significantly revised. Spe-
cifically, this revision adds detailed overall policy on the use of PCT accommodations, to include the
authorizing/reporting officials for PCT, the PCT approval process, and the PCT documentation and
reporting requirements. Family Member/Spouse Travel to Award Ceremonies: Due to the ever-changing
numbers and types of awards, specific awards were deleted and a more generic statement was added that
mirrors the spouse travel requirements to award ceremonies in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations/Joint
Travel Regulations (JFTR/JTR). The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.

                                               Chapter 2

                                          TRAVEL POLICY

2.1. Basic Travel Considerations. The Traffic Management Flight (TMF) or the (contracted) Commer-
cial Travel Office (CTO) makes official travel arrangements and provides reservations and ticketing for
all uniformed service members, Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees, their family members
and non-DoD personnel when travel orders authorize travel and transportation.
   2.1.1. The primary consideration when arranging official travel is to satisfy mission requirements fol-
   lowing DoD and Air Force transportation and travel policies. Each traveler, including all infants, must
   be issued a ticket and provided a seat on all conveyances.
   2.1.2. Official Travel. IAW DoDI 4500.42, Enclosure 2, official travel is defined as “travel performed
   under competent travel orders at appropriated fund expense.” with business of the DoD or the govern-
   ment supported by appropriate travel orders. IAW JFTR and JTR, Appendices A, official travel may
   be performed within or in the vicinity of a permanent duty station (PDS); to or from the actual resi-
   dence; to, from, or between PDS; and to, from, at, and between temporary duty (TDY) locations, or
   other authorized locations.

2.2. DoD Approved Carriers. DoDD 4500.53, DoD Commercial Air Transportation Quality and Safety
Review Program, requires the DoD to procure commercial air transportation services from air carriers
approved by the DoD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Division, HQ AMC/DOB, 402 Scott Drive, Scott
AFB IL, 62269-5302, DSN 779-4343, Commercial (618) 229-4343.
   2.2.1. The Commercial Airlift Review Board (CARB) is authorized by law to make decisions regard-
   ing the temporary non-use or permanent suspension of a air carrier in the DoD Air Transportation Pro-
   gram. The CARB maintains a listing of DoD approved and suspended air carriers. The listing is
   updated/released quarterly via message to all TMFs. A current listing may be obtained at:
   https://amc.scott.af.mil/do/dob/approved.htm. The TMF/CTO must review the listing before mak-
   ing commercial air travel arrangements.

2.3. Order of Precedence for Travel .
   2.3.1. DoD 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 103 (http://public.transcom.mil/j4/j4lt/dtr.html) directs the
   TMF/CTO to use a specific order of precedence when making official travel arrangements. Accord-
   ingly, the DoD policy, in the following priorities, in order of precedence, must be used for passenger
   airlift:
       2.3.1.1. AMC-procured channel airlift (Category B (Patriot Express)) must be used in connection
       with international travel unless there is a documented negative critical mission impact.
           2.3.1.1.1. Exceptions are as follows:
              2.3.1.1.1.1. A mission impact statement is provided by the traveler and authorized by their
              unit commander or designee only in commanders’ absence. Use the format at Attachment
              2.
              2.3.1.1.1.2. Global Air Transportation and Execution System (GATES) issues a non-avail-
              ability statement/message for the requested travel window.
18                                                          AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


                 2.3.1.1.1.3. No AMC channel, configured for passenger(s), is available. The use of Cate-
                 gory M on AMC cargo aircraft is not regularly scheduled air passenger service, but may be
                 used if it accomplishes the mission.
                 2.3.1.1.1.4. Unaccompanied minors (without guardian or adult escort) between 12 - 17
                 years of age.
                 2.3.1.1.1.5. Unaccompanied (without parent) minors under 12 years of age.
         2.3.1.2. Scheduled commercial air service contracted through the GSA Airline City Pair Program
         contract.
         2.3.1.3. Other U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) carriers.
         2.3.1.4. DoD-approved, non-CRAF U.S. flag carriers.
         2.3.1.5. Scheduled service on U.S. air carriers that are neither DoD approved nor disapproved (for
         individual travel only).
         2.3.1.6. DoD-approved foreign flag carriers.
         2.3.1.7. Scheduled service on foreign air carriers that are neither DoD-approved nor disapproved
         (for individual travel only).

2.4. U.S. Flag Carriers. Travelers are required to use U.S. flag carriers for travel funded by the U.S.
government. The use of foreign flag carriers is prohibited when U.S. carriers are available.
     2.4.1. The exception to this requirement is if a U.S. flag carrier “code share(s)” with a foreign partner
     airline. Any tickets issued under a code share agreement must show the U.S. flag carrier as the ticket
     issuing authority and is not considered a foreign carrier (B-240956; Sep 25, 1991; 70 Comptroller
     General 713 (1991)).
     2.4.2. When the TMF/CTO determines U.S. flag carriers are not available, including a code share
     partner, foreign carriers may be authorized/approved by the orders Authorizing Official (AO). See
     JFTR, par. U3125-C and JTR, par. C2204-B for determining availability and non-availability.
     2.4.3. If it is determined that U.S. flag carriers are not available, documentation explaining why a
     U.S. flag carrier can not be used must be provided to the traveler and endorsed by the AO. The docu-
     mentation must include the name of the traveler, foreign-flag ship(s) or air carrier(s) used, flight iden-
     tification number(s), origin, destination and enroute points, date(s), justification, and authorizing/
     approving official’s title, organization and signature.
     2.4.4. The travel order must be annotated reflecting U.S. flag carrier is not available to satisfy mission
     requirements and that a foreign flag carrier was authorized/approved for use.
     2.4.5. When U.S. flag carriers are available, travelers with prior authorization to personally-procure
     airline tickets (e.g., Leave-in-Conjunction with Official Travel (LICWO) or circuitous routing), must
     be advised not to use foreign flag carriers over segments of their travel for which reimbursement for
     travel must be claimed. Reimbursement is not provided (for any leg of the journey) for transportation
     costs when unauthorized/unapproved foreign carriers are used. If U.S. flag carrier service is available
     for an entire trip and the traveler uses a foreign carrier for any part or all of the trip, the transportation
     cost on the foreign carrier is not payable (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 41, Chapter 301, Part
     301-10).
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                      19


2.5. Use of General Services Administration (GSA) Airline City Pair Program.
   2.5.1. Uniformed service members and DoD employees on official travel are mandatory users of the
   GSA Airline City Pair Program. There are two types of GSA city pair fares, non-restricted city pair
   fares (YCA) and capacity controlled city pair fares (_CA) which are less expensive than YCA fares,
   but have some limitation or restrictions. The _CA fares should be used if the restriction do not hinder
   mission accomplishment. The TMF/CTO is required to use this program when a city pair exists
   between the origin and destination listed in the official travel order.
       2.5.1.1. Government contractors and contractor employees are governed by the rules in the Fed-
       eral Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 31.205-46. As such, government contractors and contractor
       employees are not government employees and are not eligible, under any circumstances, for GSA
       city pair airfares or any travel-related item restricted to government employees. The GSA city pair
       contract (solicitation) can be viewed at
       http://www.eps.gov/spg/GSA/FSS/ FCX/FCXB-C2-010001-N/Attachments.html. The HQ
       USAF/ILT, Passenger Policy web page (http://www.il.hq.af.mil.ilt/iltt/pax1.html) has a link to
       this solicitation.
   2.5.2. Government airfares (e.g., GSA city pair fares - YCA and _CA, air fares offered by non-con-
   tract carriers at city pair rates - _DG, international non-contract air fare - MMZ, etc.) may be used for
   official DoD travel only. City pair fares may not be segmented when a through-fare exists, even if it
   costs less. Constructed YCA and _CA fares may be used when there is no through-fare between the
   origin and destination listed on the official travel orders. Unlike YCA and _CA fares, when using
   other government fares such as YMZ, MMZ, MDG, HDG, the use of through or segmented fares may
   be used to meet mission requirements when they provide the overall best value. Some airlines may
   have restrictions, check with appropriate airline carrier for specifics.
   2.5.3. Exceptions to mandatory use of this program are identified in JFTR, par. U3145; JTR, par.
   C2002; and DoD 4500.9-R.
   2.5.4. This program may be used for group travel up to 20 passengers. For guidance on obtaining
   group travel arrangements for 21 or more passengers, see paragraph 3.2.
   2.5.5. When alternate departure/arrival airports are considered see paragraph 3.31. for guidance.
   Note: Use of city pair fares to or from a leave point is strictly prohibited.

2.6. The (Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (CTO). The CTO is a civilian operated business
under contract with the DoD. It furnishes the TMF a service by providing transportation and travel ser-
vices for uniformed service members and DoD employees as outlined in the scope of the contract and
DoD 4500.9-R, Part I, Chapter 102. Use of the CTO for official travel is required when the CTO is avail-
able, and the CTO shall not issue tickets to the traveler without a valid travel order/authorization or writ-
ten approval from the TMF.
   2.6.1. While the contract requires CTO employees to be knowledgeable of DoD and Air Force trans-
   portation and travel policies, the TMF is the final adjudicator on interpreting transportation and travel
   entitlements, analyzing complex transportation issues, and furnishing passenger routing determina-
   tions, should a conflict exist.
   2.6.2. In addition to official commercial travel reservations and ticketing (air, bus, rail and ship) the
   CTO provides the following services as identified in the base or centralized CTO contract:
20                                                      AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


        2.6.2.1. Routes official travelers in accordance with DoD’s order of precedence for travel (this
        AFI, Chapter 2, paragraph 2.3.) to ensure legal and contractual requirements are met and cost to
        the Government is minimized to the maximum extent. Making arrangements through the CTO
        ensures that the traveler will be fully reimbursed for official transportation costs.
        2.6.2.2. Makes official air transportation travel arrangements on Patriot Express missions using
        the Global Air Transportation and Execution System (GATES) when required by the CTO con-
        tract.
        2.6.2.3. Makes rental cars arrangements when authorized.
        2.6.2.4. Makes commercial lodging reservations associated with official travel.
        2.6.2.5. Collects and reports statistical data to Headquarters, United States Transportation Com-
        mand (USTRANSCOM) for forecasting transportation needs (Statistical Collection of Passenger
        Travel (STATCO)).
        2.6.2.6. Provides suggestions for alternate routing that could benefit DoD, Air Force, and the
        traveler by saving time and money.
        2.6.2.7. CTO Contracts follow the basic guidelines of the Air Force, CTO Official Travel Perfor-
        mance Work Statement (PWS) and Guidelines for Proposal Submission and Evaluation (copy
        posted to the AF/ILGD web site), https://www.il.hq.af.mil/ilg/ilgd/index.cfm?osymbol=ilgd
        under CTO Issues).
     2.6.3. The CTO complies with the following when making and ticketing official travel accommoda-
     tions.
        2.6.3.1. The CTO marks the traveler's itinerary/or ticket(s) either electronically or manually with
        the method of payment. Tickets purchased using a Centrally Billed Account (CBA) will state,
        "Airline ticket(s) paid by CBA, Non-Reimbursable to Traveler." Tickets purchased using an IBA
        will state, "Airline Ticket(s) paid by IBA, Reimbursable to Traveler".
        2.6.3.2. If a portion of the CBA number is needed on the travel itineraries or other documents pro-
        vided to the traveler, the number entered will be limited to no more than the last 5 digits of the
        CBA number.
        2.6.3.3. The CTO notifies the TMF of all airline ticket transactions that have potential discrepan-
        cies in authorization or billing.
        2.6.3.4. The CTO only receives travel authorizations/requests from, and sends email ticket confir-
        mations to, ".mil" or ".gov" email addresses.
     2.6.4. The CTO complies with the following when making premium class travel (PCT) accommoda-
     tions and ticketing PCT:
        2.6.4.1. The Contractor does not issue PCT tickets (first class or business class) without the travel
        order/authorization being documented as directed in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR
        U2000-A2) and the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR C2000-A2). The travel order/authorization
        must specifically state that the use of PCT is authorized/approved.
        2.6.4.2. Where extenuating circumstances or emergencies situations preclude the traveler from
        obtaining advance PCT authorization/approval (Ref JTR, par. C2000-A2a and JFTR, par.
        U2000-A2a), after-the-fact approval is permitted. In these situations, the CTO only issues PCT
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                       21


       tickets when the AO places a statement on the travel order/authorization stating, "After-the-fact
       PCT approval is being/will be pursued. Issuance of PCT tickets is authorized in anticipation of
       approval. If PCT is not approved after-the-fact by the appropriate authorizing/approval authority,
       the traveler is responsible for the cost difference between the premium class transportation used
       and the transportation class for which the traveler was eligible."
       2.6.4.3. If the Contractor issues PCT tickets without the travel order/authorization documenta-
       tion, PCT approval/authorization statement or the after-the-fact statement by the travel order/
       authorization AO, the contractor is liable for reimbursement to the Government for the cost differ-
       ence between the premium class transportation used and the transportation class for which the
       traveler was eligible.
       2.6.4.4. Travelers are authorized to upgrade to premium class services and accommodations at
       personnel expense (e.g., cash or using personal frequent traveler benefits) without obtaining PCT
       approval.
   2.6.5. CTO requirements pertaining to fully unused tickets and partially used tickets and turn-in for
   refunds.
       2.6.5.1. The CTO notifies travelers that all unused and partially used tickets are of value and must
       be turned in for the applicable refund.
       2.6.5.2. The CTO maintains a daily log of all identified fully unused and partially used tickets.
       2.6.5.3. The CTO provides the TMF, once a month, a report of unused tickets obtained through
       the contractor’s Global Distribution System.
       2.6.5.4. The CTO identifies and cancels unused tickets 30 days after the last scheduled travel
       date, and initiates the ticket refund process.
       2.6.5.5. The CTO processes unused ticket refund requests with the airlines.
       2.6.5.6. The CTO provides the TMF with copies of all requests for refunds.
       2.6.5.7. The CTO provides the TMF with the data required to complete the Unused Ticket Data
       and Refund Data report. A copy of the report format is available at the AF/ILGD web site, under
       Unused Ticket Issues.
   2.6.6. The CTO complies with the CBA Procedures identified in Attachment 6 of this AFI and/or as
   specified in the CTO contract statement of work.

2.7. Use of Premium Class Travel (PCT) Accommodations. DoD policy requires the use of least
expensive coach class transportation accommodations for all official travel. Travel requirements should
be determined in sufficient time to reserve coach class accommodations for members, employees and
their dependents. Advance planning to include the use of alternate travel dates or rest stops is essential to
ensure travelers comply with DoD policy. PCT accommodations may be used only when exceptional cir-
cumstances are warranted to meet mission requirements and must not be common practice. Blanket
authorization/approval of PCT is not permitted. Requests for PCT accommodations will be considered on
a case-by-case basis. PCT accommodations shall not be used for PCS travel nor for CONUS to CONUS
flights, except for those limited conditions outlined in the JFTR or JTR. When PCT is authorized/
approved it applies to the principal traveler only, unless specifically approved for other travelers in the
party. PCT upgrades are permitted without approval when there is no cost to the Government (e.g.,

through the use of cash or frequent traveler benefits). For guidance on using frequent flyer program bene-
fits for upgrade to premium class travel, see Chapter 3, paragraph 3.30. of this AFI.
     2.7.1. Premium Class Travel (PCT) Categories. There are two types of PCT accommodations: first
     class and premium class other than first class. Hereafter, premium class, other than first class, will be
     referred to as business class in this AFI. When an airline flight has only two classes of service, the
     higher class of service, regardless of the term used, is treated as first class.
        2.7.1.1. PCT accommodations may be authorized/approved on an exception basis only as out-
        lined in the JFTR, paragraph U3125, for military personnel and their dependents and the JTR,
        paragraph C2204, for DoD civilian employees, their dependents, and others traveling under Invi-
        tational Travel Authorizations (ITAs).
        2.7.1.2. First class travel accommodations may be authorized/approved when at least one of the
        criteria identified in the JTR, paragraph C2204-B3 or the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B3 is met, fully
        justified and documented.
        2.7.1.3. Business Class travel accommodations may be authorized/approved when at least one of
        the criteria identified in the JTR, paragraph C2204-B4 or the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B4 is met,
        fully justified and documented.
     2.7.2. Premium Class Travel Authorizing/Reporting Officials. PCT can only be authorized/approved
     on an exception basis. Authorizing/approving officials must consider each request for PCT accommo-
     dations individually and carefully balance good stewardship of scarce resources with the immediacy
     of mission requirements. Requests that do not clearly substantiate an exceptional mission need justi-
     fying the use of PCT should be disapproved. To assist the traveler and the PCT authorizing/approving
     official in the request/approval process, a first class and business class decision support tool is avail-
     able at the AF/ILGD web site, under Premium Class Travel Issues. NOTE: Refer also to Table 2.7.T1
     at the end of this section.
        2.7.2.1. Self-approval of PCT for business or first class is prohibited.
        2.7.2.2. Code two and three Presidential appointees and three- and four-star general officers must
        now obtain business class travel approval from a person senior to the traveler in their chain of
        command.
        2.7.2.3. The Traffic Management Flight (TMF)/Commercial Travel Office (CTO) may no longer
        authorize/approve first or business class travel accommodations when regularly scheduled flights
        between the authorized origin and destination (including connection points) provide only first
        class or business class accommodations. These flights must now be authorized/approved by the
        appropriate business or first class travel authorizing/approving authority.
        2.7.2.4. First class travel accommodations. The SecAF has designated SAF/OS and SAF/US as
        the approval authorities for all first class travel accommodation requests, except as noted below.
        First class travel requests for civilian personnel will be submitted to SAF/AA for review and rout-
        ing to SAF/OS or SAF/US as appropriate for consideration. First class travel requests for military
        personnel will be routed to AF/ILGD for review and forwarding to AF/CV. AF/CV will review
        and determine whether or not military requests should be forwarded to SAF/AA for approval con-
        sideration. SAF/AA will review and route to SAF/OS or SAF/US as appropriate for consideration.
        Note the approval authority exception at paragraph 2.7.2.9. below.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                       23


     2.7.2.5. Business class travel accommodations. The SecAF has designated the following as busi-
     ness class travel authorization/approval and reporting officials. Note the approval authority excep-
     tion at paragraph 2.7.2.9. below.
     2.7.2.6. Air Staff and Air Force Secretariat civilian personnel forward all business class travel
     accommodation requests to SAF/AA. Air Staff and Air Force Secretariat military personnel will
     route all business class travel accommodation requests to AF/ILGD, for review and forwarding to
     AF/CV. AF/CV will review and determine whether or not military requests should be forwarded to
     SAF/AA for consideration. SAF/AA is the business class approval authority for three-star gener-
     als and below and civilian equivalents assigned to the Air Staff and the Air Force Secretariat. SAF/
     AA will review and forward business class travel requests for four-star general and civilian equiv-
     alents assigned within the Air Staff and the Air Force Secretariat to SAF/OS or SAF/US as appro-
     priate for consideration. Note the approval authority exception at paragraph 2.7.2.9. below.
     2.7.2.7. The MAJCOM Commander (MAJCOM CV in the absence of the CC) is the authoriza-
     tion/approval authority for business class travel for requests from personnel assigned to the MAJ-
     COM. Note: Includes personnel assigned to a Numbered Air Force when traveling on Air Force
     business. When traveling on Joint business, requests for business-class approval are submitted in
     accordance with the Joint Staff approval procedures.
     2.7.2.8. The AF/CV, or AF/CVA in the absence of the CV, is the authorization/approval authority
     for business class travel for requests from personnel assigned to Direct Reporting Units (DRUs)
     and Field Operating Agencies (FOAs). Requests for business class travel accommodation will be
     routed to AF/ILGD for review and forwarded to AF/CV for consideration.
     2.7.2.9. In accordance with the JTR, paragraphs C2204-B3d (first class) and B4d (business class),
     and JFTR, paragraphs U3125-B3d (first class) and B4d (business class) the category "When
     required by mission" can only be applied in connection with Presidential, Congressional or Secre-
     tarial designated boards, commissions, task forces, and special high level invited guests (approval
     level is Executive Secretary, Office of the Secretary of Defense) and for the Armed Forces Enter-
     tainment (AFE) Program, (approval level is the Executive Agent for the AFE program, currently
     the Department of the Air Force).
  2.7.3. Premium Class Travel (PCT) Approval Process. Every effort should be made to obtain
  approval prior to traveling. However, in cases where extenuating or emergency circumstances make
  advanced authorization impossible, the traveler must still obtain "after-the-fact" written authorization
  at the earliest possible time. In the event an after-the-fact request is disapproved, the traveler is liable
  for the difference in cost between the premium class and coach class air accommodations.
     2.7.3.1. The designated authorization/approval officials may authorize/approve first class accom-
     modations when at least one of the conditions in the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B3 or the JTR, para-
     graph C2204-B3 is met, and may approve business class accommodations provided at least one of
     the conditions in the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B4 or JTR, paragraph C2204-B4 is met.
     2.7.3.2. To assist in the authorization/approval official in determining whether the PCT request
     meets the JTR/JFTR criteria, a PCT Decision Support Tool has been developed for use by the trav-
     eler, travel authorizing official (AO), and the premium class authorizing/approval official. The
     PCT Decision Support Tool is available at the AF/ILGD web site, under Premium Class Travel
     Issues.
24                                                     AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


        2.7.3.3. The traveler submits the PCT request through the traveler’s order authorizing official
        (AO) to the appropriate PCT authorization/approval authority designated above. Requests for
        PCT accommodation that must be approved at the AF/CV, SAF/AA, SAF/US or SAF/OS levels
        should be submitted as soon as the requirement is anticipated, but not less than 15 duty days prior
        to the desired travel date. Note: MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs may want to establish PCT internal
        routing procedures for their organizations.
        2.7.3.4. A sample request for approval of PCT accommodation due to a Disability, or Other Phys-
        ical Impairment and a request for Other than a Disability, or Other Physical Impairment are avail-
        able at the AF/ILGD web site, under Premium Class Travel Issues. Justification for the PCT
        category requests must state why PCT is necessary for mission accomplishment and not just iden-
        tify the category as indicated in the JTR or JFTR. Much of the information indicated on the sample
        PCT request is used for the PCT reporting requirement.
        2.7.3.5. The designated PCT authorization/approval authority reviews the request to ensure suffi-
        cient justification is provided to show mission necessity and justify the expenditure of additional
        Government funds required for the PCT. After the decision is made to approve or disapprove the
        PCT request, the PCT authorization/approval authority forwards the decision to the travel autho-
        rizing official (AO). If the PCT request is approved, the PCT approval authority must retain a file
        copy of the approved package for a period of 6 years and 3 months for audit purposes.
        2.7.3.6. When the travel AO receives the PCT authorization/approval authority’s decision, the
        AO notifies the traveler of the decision. If approved, the AO ensures that the appropriate docu-
        mentation (see below for appropriate words) is entered on the travel order/authorization so the
        CTO can issue PCT tickets.
     2.7.4. PCT Documentation Requirements.
        2.7.4.1. Before the CTO can issue PCT tickets, a statement must be entered in the remarks section
        of the travel order/authorization indicating that PCT has been approved. The minimum informa-
        tion that must be entered on the travel order/authorization is:
           2.7.4.1.1. The type of PCT accommodations approved. (Business or First Class.)
           2.7.4.1.2. The regulatory reference in the JTR/JFTR that was used to justify the PCT.
           2.7.4.1.3. The cost difference between the premium class and coach class fares (normal Gov-
           ernment routing, YCA and other Government contract fares, etc., available).
           2.7.4.1.4. The premium class approving authority, Name, Rank, and Office Symbol.
           An example of required statement:
           Example: Business class travel has been justified and approved based on JFTR, U3125-B4a,
           space is not available in coach class. The cost difference between the business class fare and
           the coach class fare is $765.00. This PCT was approved by General, David Smith, HQ USAF/
           XXXX. Full documentation of the PCT approval is on file in the office of the PCT approving
           official.
        2.7.4.2. For those situations, as identified in the JTR, paragraph C2000-A2a and JFTR, paragraph
        U2000-A2a, where "extenuating circumstances or emergency situations" prevent advance authori-
        zation/approval of premium class travel, a statement will be placed on that travel order/authoriza-
        tion to permit CTO ticketing. The statement must indicate the extenuating circumstance or
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     25


     emergency precluding PCT authorization/approval prior to the start of travel and that authoriza-
     tion/approval is being or will be pursued after-the-fact. Issuance of PCT tickets by the CTO is per-
     mitted in anticipation of approval. If the authorizing/approval authority does not approve the
     after-the-fact PCT request, the traveler is responsible for the cost difference between the PCT
     transportation used and the transportation class for which the traveler was eligible. The statement
     must include the cost difference between the coach class and the premium class being requested
     and the name, rank and office symbol of the AO. The JFTR/JTR requires that after-the-fact PCT
     approval be completed within seven days of travel completion. It will be the responsibility of the
     traveler and AO to ensure that the PCT approval is obtained or that the traveler pays the difference
     between the travel class authorized and the travel class used.
     An example of required statement:
     Example: After-the fact approval for business class travel is being pursued. This is a short notice
     travel requirement and sufficient time is not available to obtain authorization/approval prior to
     travel commencement. Business class travel is being justified in accordance with JFTR, paragraph
     U3125-B4a; space is not available in coach class. The cost difference between the business class
     fare and the coach class fare is $765.00. If the request for business class travel is not approved, the
     traveler is responsible for the cost difference between the business class fare and the coach class
     fare. The travel order/authorization, authorizing official is Lt Col, Robert Jones, 355th XXX. The
     CTO is authorized to provide business class tickets for this travel.
  2.7.5. Premium Class Travel Reporting Requirement. All PCT must be reported to the Office of the
  Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness). The first report covered the period of 1 Apr
  04 through 30 Jun 04; the second report covered the period of 1 Jul 04 through 30 Sep 04. Future
  reports are required to be submitted semiannually, 1 Oct through 31 Mar, and 1 Apr through 30 Sep,
  with reports due to OUSD (P&R) 30 days after the end of reporting period. The office of the approv-
  ing official must enter on the spreadsheet (copy available at the ILGD web site, under Premium Class
  Travel Issues) the data required for reporting up channel. Also, available at the web site is a copy of
  the Premium Class Travel Report Data Elements Instructions. The reports (spreadsheets) should be
  completed and forwarded as an email attachment to
  "mailto:AFILGD.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil", not later than 20 days after the end of each report-
  ing period. AF/ILGD is responsible for consolidating and forwarding the Air Force report to OUSD
  (P&R).
     2.7.5.1. ‘Exceptional circumstances’ may be - travel on an extremely demanding schedule, the
     requirement to work enroute to the TDY location, and the need to be prepared to perform official
     duties and properly represent the Air Force or U.S. Government immediately upon arrival.
     2.7.5.2. Use of the '14-hour rule' requires that scheduled flight time (including stopovers) is in
     excess of 14 hours, and that the traveler be required to perform a full day (8 hours) of work imme-
     diately upon arrival at the TDY location. Business-class travel can not be approved under this rule
     when rest stops are approved.

                      SAF/AA to SAF/OS or SAF/US


                      Note: 1 & 2.                         Notes: 1, 3, & 6.

NOTES:
     1. Premium class travel authorizing/approving officials may not approve their own premium
        class travel accommodations. Authorization/approval must be obtained from a senior flag
        officer or civilian equivalent. Example: A four-star MAJCOM commander has business class
        approval authority for those within the MAJCOM on an exception basis and when the travel
28                                                      AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


            request meets the established criteria in the JFTR/JTR. However, MAJCOM commanders
            must submit their own business class travel requests to AF/CC or AF/CV, as appropriate.
        2. Civilian requests for first class travel will be submitted to SAF/AA. SAF/AA will review
           requests prior to forwarding to SAF/US or SAF/OS as appropriate. Military member requests
           for first class travel will be submitted to AF/ILGD. AF/ILGD will review requests and for-
           ward to AF/CV for review and forward to SAF/AA who will review and forward to SAF/US
           or SAF/OS for approval consideration.
        3. The authorization/approval authority for business class travel may be delegated no lower than
           to a two-star general officer or civilian equivalent level, and the approving official must be
           senior in the reporting chain to the requester. Therefore, if the indicated approval authority is
           not a two-star general officer or civilian equivalent or higher and senior in the chain of com-
           mand, the request must be forwarded up the chain of command for appropriate approval.
        4. Civilians assigned to the Air Staff and Secretariat will submit business class requests to SAF/
           AA. Military member requests for business class travel will be submitted to AF/ILGD. AF/
           ILGD will review requests and forward to AF/CV for review and forwarding to SAF/AA who
           will in turn review and as appropriate forward to SAF/US or SAF/OS for approval consider-
           ation. SAF/AA is the business class approval authority for three-star generals and below, and
           civilian equivalents assigned to the Air Staff and Secretariat. SAF/OS and SAF/US are the
           business class approval authorities for four-star generals and civilian equivalents assigned to
           the Air Staff and Secretariat.
        5. For personnel traveling on Air Force business, MAJCOM/CCs, and MAJCOM/CVs in the
           absence of the MAJCOM/CC, have business class approval authority for personnel under
           their command, including personnel assigned to numbered air forces. When personnel travel
           on Joint business, requests for business class travel approval are submitted in accordance with
           Joint staff or command approval procedures.
        6. The Air National Guard Director (NGB/CF) has business class approval authority for person-
           nel assigned to the ANG. In the absence of the NGB/CF, requests for business class travel will
           be forwarded through AF/ILGD to AF/CV for business class travel approval consideration.
     2.7.6. Codes two and three Presidential appointees, and three- and four-star generals may self-autho-
     rize/approve business-class accommodations when traveling TDY overseas and when at least one of
     the conditions identified in the JFTR or JTR for business-class travel are met. This authority extends
     to the principal traveler only and does not constitute blanket approval authority. Travel within the
     CONUS must be by coach-class only.
        2.7.6.1. Senior travelers must personally approve business-class air accommodation by providing
        written justification in accordance with the JFTR or JTR. The approval authorization must state
        which of the eight circumstances stated in these regulations apply. The senior traveler must sign
        the authorization reflecting their decision requiring the use of business-class travel.
        2.7.6.2. Disposition of the signed authorization is as follows: The Senior traveler’s duty section
        must keep the original signed copy on file. A copy must be provided to the TMF/CTO when tick-
        ets are purchased or picked up. A copy must be filed with the travel voucher on completion of
        travel.

2.8. Family Member/Spouse Travel. As a general rule, a family member may not travel at government
expense with a sponsor who is traveling on official business (TDY). However, travel is permitted under
certain circumstances. For the most part the Air Force limits family member travel to spouses. Because
spouse travel is a highly visible and sensitive area, it requires judicious application with a thorough
review at each level of command. Precedent setting requests require a high level of scrutiny and it is
encouraged to coordinate through the respective legal office. Requests for spouse travel at Government
expense must show there is an unquestionably official function in which the spouse/family member is
actually to participate in an official capacity or it must be deemed in the national interest because of dip-
lomatic or public relations benefit to the country (See DoDD 4500.56, enclosure 2, paragraph E2.5.). Both
commercial and MilAir authorization/approval must be supported with Invitational Travel Orders (ITOs)
ordinarily authorizing reimbursement of transportation costs only. Travel by MilAir is allowed on a mis-
sion non-interference basis. The authorizing/order-issuing official may authorize/approve transportation.
A Vice Commander cannot approve his or her own spouse/family member travel. Neither may the Vice
Commanders approve MAJCOM Commander spouse/family member travel. Four-star general officers
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     31


may self-approve as outlined in DoDD 4500.56, DoD Policy on the Use of Government Aircraft and Air
Travel, but AFSOC and AFRC Commanders will still require AF/CV approval for travel of their own
spouse/family member. In the limited instances per diem or other actual expenses are to be paid, the
CSAF must grant prior approval. Per diem and other expense allowances may be authorized by CSAF if
the individual's travel is mission essential and there is a benefit for DoD beyond fulfilling a representa-
tional role (See JTR/JFTR, Appendix E, paragraph 13.c). No travel arrangements may be made for spouse
travel until approved by the proper authority.
2.8. (AFRC) Family Member/Spouse Travel. In light of the exceptional nature of spouse travel at gov-
ernment expense, AFRC requestors seeking approval of such spouse travel are required to review para-
graph 2.8. of this AFI in its entirety prior to submitting requests to AFRC/CC or CV. The request must
fully justify spouse travel at government expense in accordance with the guidance contained therein.
Requests for approval must:


include a separate memo stating the expected cost of the requested travel and containing
complete justification; and,
state the benefit government-funded spouse travel will provide to DoD, the Air Force, and/
or AFRC and its members; and,
demonstrate with specific details (including sufficient and complete facts related to the
event) exactly how the requested spouse travel clearly meets one of the two alternate bases
for approvable spouse travel with reference to the specific guidelines below: “actual
participation in an official event” (para 2.8.1., below), or, “diplomatic or public relations
benefit to the nation” (para 2.8.2. & 2.8.3., below); and
include a written legal review from the requestor’s supporting Staff Judge Advocate and
concurrence of the requestor’s immediate commander (and, where applicable, similar legal
review and command concurrence at AFRC NAF-level); and,
state any, known detriment which would result if the request for spouse travel at government
expense is disapproved; and,
be submitted to AFRC/CC or CV as far in advance of the requested spouse travel as
possible, but routinely not less than 15 days prior to the intended travel date.
   2.8.1. Guidelines for approving spouse travel at Government expense based on actual participation in
   an official event.
       2.8.1.1. Requests for a spouse’s attendance at conferences, events, visits or tours is not on its own
       merit sufficient justification for spouse travel at Government expense. To meet the criteria for
       “actual participation” the spouse must actually confer with DoD officials on official DoD matters
       in a manner directly benefiting the AF through an exchange of substantive information, advice
       and/or guidance.
       2.8.1.1. (AFRC) Requests seeking AFRC/CC or CV approval for spouse travel based upon the
       “exchange of substantive information, advice, or guidance” with “DoD [USAF, or other officials]
       on official matters” must include a statement that the spouse agrees to submit an after-action
       report (as soon as practicable upon the spouse’s return to the home unit), for forwarding to AFRC/
       CV, which describes the substantive information involved and, when applicable, describes the
       expected home unit forum at which the spouse will convey acquired information.

     2.8.2. Guidelines for approving spouse travel based on a diplomatic or public relations benefit to the
     nation. There may be functions when it is in the best interest of the nation to have a spouse participate.
     However, the issues or audiences must transcend AF only interests. The term “national interest” infers
     some broader interest than that of the military departments or the DoD.
     2.8.3. Examples of events having a diplomatic or public relations benefit to the nation.
        2.8.3.1. Travel requests may include trips to functions with government officials of foreign coun-
        tries, including travel of spouses to act as escorts for spouses during CSAF counterpart visits or
        attaché visits, and meeting with officials of the foreign ministry, defense ministry and foreign air
        force. Public relations events include visiting with local officials where AF personnel are sta-
        tioned. It may include travel within the U.S. when the spouse accompanies the AF official to pub-
        lic relations functions, which include spouses of local officials and/or civic leaders.
        2.8.3.2. A spouse’s participation in a social event attended only by DoD or Air Force officials is
        not sufficient justification for travel at government expense.
        2.8.3.3. When local officials or civic leaders will be present, visits to DoD schools, hospitals,
        day-care facilities, family service centers, family housing areas, housing management offices,
        commissary or exchange facilities.
        2.8.3.4. Representing the military family at key civic events.
     2.8.4. Invitational travel orders (ITOs). In all instances of spouse travel, after the authorizing author-
     ity approves spouse travel, the requesting organization will issue ITOs in accordance with AFI 65-103
     Temporary Duty Orders, the JFTR, or the JTR, Appendix E, funding transportation only. A specific
     approval request must be generated for each instance of spouse travel. The invitational travel order
     will be personally signed by the sponsor. “Blanket” ITOs may not be issued. Documentation to
     include justification for all spouse travel approval will be retained for two years.
        2.8.4.1. Include the following statement in the invitational travel order as specified in JTR, Part 1,
        Appendix E., “This order authorizes the dependent to accompany the sponsor to attend an official
        function. It does not entitle the dependent to per diem or other expense allowances. If the depen-
        dent does not desire to bear the expenses, this order is canceled.”
     2.8.5. Four-star generals officers are authorized to approve their own spouse’s travel when the travel
     meets the criteria of this AFI.
     2.8.6. MAJCOM Commanders/Vice Commanders may approve spouse travel for personnel assigned
     to their command when the travel meets the criteria of this AFI. 2.8.6.1. through 2.8.6.5. are examples
     of spouse travel deemed to meet the criteria for unquestionably official travel. Note: A Vice Com-
     mander cannot approve a spouse travel request for his or her own spouse in the absence of the MAJ-
     COM/CC. (Only four-star general officers may self-approve as outlined in DoDD 4500.56, DoD
     Policy on the Use of Government Aircraft and Air Travel. AFSOC and AFRC Commanders will still
     require AF/CV approval for travel of their spouse).
     2.8.6. (AFRC) Requests seeking AFRC/CC or CV approval for spouse travel at government expense
     must cite the particular sub-paragraph of this AFI (paras 2.8.6.1. through 2.8.6.6., below) which the
     requestor is using to show the type of spouse travel involved in the request, in addition to satisfying
     the requirements of AFRC supplementary para 2.8., above.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                 33



In the absence of advance AFRC/CC or CV approval of spouse travel to an event (e.g.,
AFRC Commanders Annual Conferences), a request must also explain how the applied
sub-paragraph justifies the particular request, including compliance (or explanation for
non-compliance) with any conditions or guidelines contained in the applicable
sub-paragraph (for example, “2.8.6.1. . . . . Spouse travel visits should be limited to host/
wing bases subordinate to the NAF, and it is encouraged to involve more than one base per
trip.” Any request applying para 2.8.6.1. as the reason for CC or CV approval must address
the two “limitations” shown in italics.) All requests for approval must comply with the
detailed requirements of para 2.8. of this supplement, above
If requested spouse travel is to an event sponsored or conducted by a non-AFRC entity (e.g.,
a conference, “Rally”, or event held or hosted by another USAF MAJCOM, military service
or federal agency), but AFRC is expected to fund the spouse travel (if approved), the request
for AFRC/CC or CV approval must include any, available documentation showing that the
sponsoring entity has invited the spouse. Further, the request will indicate whether or not a
non-AFRC “spouse travel approval authority” has been requested to or has already
approved spouse travel for AFRC invitees to the non-AFRC event.

       2.8.6.1. Spouse travel for Numbered Air Force (NAF) Commander’s spouse may be approved for
       visits to NAF bases. Spouse travel visits should be limited to host wing/bases subordinate to the
       NAF, and it is encouraged to involve more than one base per trip.
       2.8.6.2. Spouse travel may be approved for MAJCOM Commander/Command Chief Master Ser-
       geant Annual Conferences. Spouse travel for this event should be limited to one trip per fiscal
       year.
       2.8.6.3. Spouse travel may be approved for Squadron Commander Orientation Conferences when
       the sponsor of the spouse attending is a current squadron commander and has at least 12 months of
       tenure remaining. Only one trip to the commander orientation conference should be authorized
       during the sponsor’s tenure as a squadron commander.
       2.8.6.4. Spouse travel may be approved for Professional Development Programs and should be
       limited to no more than two events per year each for the officer professional development program
       and the enlisted professional development program.
       2.8.6.5. Participating in DoD or service component training courses, conferences, or seminars
       supporting family readiness as a “subject-matter expert” (e.g., the spouse is qualified to speak/
       train by virtue of his/her education in a particular subject.)
       2.8.6.6. At the discretion of the MAJCOM/CC/CV, other similar spouse travel events may be
       approved when the travel meets the criteria of this AFI.
   2.8.7. Selected three-star generals officers (5AF/CC, 7AF/CC, 11AF/CC and 16AF/CC) serving as
   combined commanders are authorized to approve their own spouse travel when acting in the role of
   the combined commander when the travel meets the criteria of this AFI. When acting in their AF role,
   these commanders must submit their spouse travel requests IAW paragraph 2.8.6. (also see DoD
   4515.13-R Enclosure 2)
   2.8.8. Spouse travel requests not under the cognizant authority of a commander specified above must
   be forwarded through command/air staff channels to AF/CV (provide information copy to HQ USAF/
34                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


     ILT for staffing) for authorization/approval. Requests should be submitted as soon as the requirement
     is anticipated, but not less than 20 duty days prior to the desired travel date. When submitting requests
     to the AF/CV, the MAJCOM commander (CV in CC’s absence) must sign all requests. Full justifica-
     tion is required for all requests and must meet the criteria of this AFI.

2.9. Family Member/Spouse Travel to Award Ceremonies.
     2.9.1. MAJCOM commanders and vice commanders may approve spouse travel for spouses of award
     recipients to attend a major award ceremony (i.e., Presidential award ceremony, or an annual agency
     or major organizational component ceremony, or a prestigious honorary award ceremony sponsored
     by a non-Federal organization). When family member/spouse travel to attend an award ceremony is
     approved, an Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) will be issued. Only transportation costs will be
     funded; per diem will not be paid.
        2.9.1.1. If there is no spouse or the spouse is unable to attend, the recipient may elect to invite one
        family member to attend the ceremony. When family member travel to attend an award ceremony
        is approved, an ITA will be issued. Only transportation costs will be funded; per diem will not be
        paid. See JTR, Appendix E, Part I for further guidance.
        2.9.1.2. When the family member/spouse is an Air Force uniformed service member or Air Force
        Civil Service employee and family member/spouse travel is approved, a TDY order will be issued
        rather than an ITA.
        2.9.1.3. When an individual who is neither an Air Force member nor an Air Force Civil Service
        employee is selected as an award recipient, the recipient and family member/spouse may travel on
        an ITA to attend the presentation ceremony. See JFTR/JTR, Appendix E, for guidance and limita-
        tions on travel reimbursements.
NOTE: Family members and spouses traveling to an award ceremony are not required to meet the partic-
ipation requirements stipulated in this AFI, Paragraph 2.8.

                                       TRAVEL PROCEDURES

3.1. Dual Commitment Transportation. DoD passengers in CONUS must use commercial transporta-
tion except when military transportation is essential to meet training or mission requirements or when
opportune capability is generated as a result of training or logistics support requirements. Commercial
transportation must not be requested or scheduled unless all actions to obtain MilAir have been termi-
nated. Commercial air reservations must not be made to backup individual or group travel requests if
MilAir is scheduled. Mission requirements must be the determining factor when using commercial air.
Advise travelers to cancel MilAir or commercial air reservations in advance. Penalty fees may apply on
some fare basis offered by commercial airline carriers.

3.2. Group movements. For the purpose of this AFI group travel is considered two or more passengers
on the same mission, departing on the same flight and arriving on the same flight. Most airlines define a
group as 10 or more passengers leaving from one point and arriving at the same point on the same flight.
Booking individual reservations in order to by-pass group booking procedures is in violation of airline tar-
iffs and is not acceptable under any circumstances. TMFs have authority to route any size group except
those requiring the purchase of a full planeload charter.
     3.2.1. When available, groups of 20 or less passengers may use the GSA Airline City Pair Program.
     Groups of 10-20 passengers using city pair fares must book through the carrier’s group booking
     office.
     3.2.2. When city pair fares are NOT available for groups of 10 or more and when City Pair flights are
     available for groups of 21 or more passengers (non-mandatory city pair users), but less than a plane-
     load, it is recommended that commercial airline reservations for the group travel be made through
     USTRANSCOM/GOPAX: TCJ3, DSN: 779-1333/CML 618-229-1333, FAX DSN: 576-8429/CML
     618-229-8429 or by contacting the airline’s group travel help desk for rate quotes. Additional infor-
     mation on arranging group moves can be found in DoD 4500-9R, Part I, Chapter 104, paragraph F.
     3.2.3. Under the GSA Airline City Pair Program agreement and the Military Air Transportation
     Agreement (MATA) airlines may impose group travel cancellation penalties for late passenger cancel-
     lations and no-shows. Conditions and penalty fees that may be imposed can be found in the GSA Air-
     line City Pair Program contract solicitation, and in the MATA. The MATA can be viewed through the
     HQ AMC Contract Airlift Division (DOY) web site https://public.scott.af.mil/hqamc/do/DOY.htm
     and the GSA City Pairs Contract Solicitation can be viewed at
     http://www.eps.gov/spg/GSA/FSS/FCS/FCXB-C2-0100001-N/Attachments.html. Extracts of the
     GSA City Pair Program Group Travel policy and contract solicitation and links to the HQ AMCDOY
     web site can be viewed at the HQ USAF/ILTT, Passenger Team web site
     (http://www.il.hq.af.mil/ilt/iltt/pax1.html).
     3.2.4. It is recommended that group travel flight arrangements be charged to the Centrally Billed
     Account (CBA) to preclude individuals from facing the consequences of obtaining reimbursement on
     their Individually Billed Account (IBA).

3.3. Leave-In-Conjunction with Official (LICWO) Travel. When a traveler is taking leave-in-con-
junction with official TDY travel, the use of government contract airfares (e.g., YCA, _CA) and other
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     37


government fares (e.g., YMZ, MMZ, MDG, LDG, etc.) are strictly prohibited to and from leave points.
These fares are offered by the airline industry for official travel purposes only, not for unfunded leave
travel. Most airlines offer military members special or discount leave fares. The traveler must schedule all
official travel through the TMF/CTO to ensure appropriate routing and reimbursement. The TMF must
establish and publish local procedures for obtaining LICWO travel services based on their CTO contract
and the method used for travel arrangements and ticketing.
   3.3.1. The Air Force currently has two primary methods for providing leisure travel services associ-
   ated with LICWO travel.
       3.3.1.1. Leisure travel services may be provided by the Leisure Travel CTO on base. In this situ-
       ation the Leisure Travel CTO has exclusive rights to provide leisure travel services on the base. In
       the Air Force, this method is being phased out, eliminating the on base leisure travel CTO. The lei-
       sure travel CTO is being replaced by the Services’ Information, Ticket and Travel (ITT) office.
       3.3.1.2. When the ITT office is established on base, the Official Travel CTO can provide arrange-
       ments and ticketing for both the leisure and official travel for both the traveler and family mem-
       bers traveling on same day/days as official travel, when requested by the official traveler.
       However, it is strictly the individual’s choice to arrange LICWO with the official CTO. The trav-
       eler may also elect to make leisure travel arrangements through the ITT office.
   3.3.2. When the desired LICWO travel involves deviating from normal routing for the official travel,
   the TMF/CTO and FM must issue a LICWO travel memo (Attachment 5) to the traveler allowing
   them to self-procure one-way or roundtrip tickets, whichever benefits the member, when approved in
   advance. The memo must identify Government costs limits for the official portion of the trip, and pre-
   cludes problems with the traveler obtaining proper reimbursement.

3.4. Government Travel Card (GTC). Air Force members and employees are authorized at com-
mander-approved locations to procure official travel services through the CTO using the IBA. MAJCOMs
may direct the method of payment for their respective bases. When IBAs are used, the TMF/CTO must
record the authorized/official travel cost on the passenger name record (PNR) to facilitate reimbursement.
The TMF must provide written notification to the traveler or the finance services office (FSO) when
directing procurement of airline tickets from a source other than the CTO. TMFs, in conjunction with the
CTO and FSO, must establish local procedures for the use of an IBA and CBA.

3.5. International Travel. To arrange routes and reservations, the TMF/CTO routes the traveler IAW the
AMC Channel Sequence Listing, MTMC Routing Guide for DoD International Air Travel, Transporta-
tion Facility Guide (http://www.mtmc.army.mil), GSA Airline City Pair Program, DoD 4500.54-G
(http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil) and other appropriate industry publications and service directives.
   3.5.1. The TMF/CTO must obtain reservations from the AMC Passenger Reservation Center (PRC)
   by telephone or via GATES for international travel when available. If military or AMC contracted air
   transportation is not available, the TMF/CTO must route travelers using the GSA Airline City Pair
   Program fares (when available) over the normally traveled route between the closest international air-
   port serving the old or new PDS, the official TDY location, or the designated privately owned vehicle
   (POV) port or vehicle processing center. Members may select an alternate international airport
   between the losing and gaining duty stations; however, this constitutes circuitous travel (PCS only)
   and must be processed IAW paragraph 3.10. Travel reimbursement must not exceed the constructive
   costs between the old and new duty stations.
38                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


     3.5.2. A 10-day travel window is required for all PCS travelers; however, a 14-day window is recom-
     mended for members traveling with pets. For all other types of official travel (except emergency
     leave, short-notice, humanitarian travelers, retirements, etc.), it is highly recommended that each
     TMF/CTO establish a travel window to ensure maximum utilization of available resources such as
     Patriot Express missions without mission degradation.
     3.5.3. To establish a uniform entitlement for official travel cost comparisons, use the priority order of
     precedence for passenger airlift provided in paragraph 2.3. Guidelines in the following paragraphs
     establish the recommended primary ports for PCS, TDY and other transoceanic travel such as: circui-
     tous travel, early return of dependents, student travel, etc. These guidelines do not apply to emergency
     leave.
        3.5.3.1. For travel to and from Pacific Air Force’s (PACAF) installations, use either Seattle or Los
        Angeles International Airport AMC channels if available and if it meets mission requirements. If
        AMC is not available, use GSA city pairs. If city pair fares are not available use the best value
        commercial airfare that meets mission requirements.
        3.5.3.2. For travel to and from United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and United States
        Central Command (USCENTCOM) installations, use either Baltimore-Washington International
        or Atlanta International Hartsfield Airport, AMC channel, if available, and if it meets mission
        requirements. If AMC is not available, use GSA city pairs. If city pair fares are not available use
        the best value commercial airfare that meets mission requirements.
     3.5.4. Travelers may request a rest stop on international flights at the CONUS/OCONUS port of entry
     in connection with official travel. Rest stops may be requested for international travel when offered by
     the airline carrier and travel is conducted over the normally traveled route. A rest stop must not exceed
     24 hours. Travelers must not be routed circuitously to take advantage of a rest stop. See JFTR, par.
     U4300-C and D and JTR, par. C1058.

3.6. Excess Cost Collection for Official Travel . AMC fares, GSA Airline City Pair program fares or
other government fares when available, are the primary method for determining official travel cost. Fares
must be based on the air service available at the time of request (e.g., how much the travel cost would
have been if the TMF/CTO had booked the travel). When the IBA is used, the traveler submits a voucher
for reimbursement of authorized government travel costs only. When a CBA or GTR (SF 1169) is used
and a member’s travel request exceeds the authorized government cost, the TMF/CTO must initiate a DD
Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher or DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization. These forms
may be viewed at http://web1/whs.osd.mil/. Government constructive costs should be on the PNR and
filed with travel voucher as appropriate for the following:
     3.6.1. Circuitous travel.
     3.6.2. DoD civilians space-required emergency leave (cash reimbursement basis).
     3.6.3. Noncommand sponsored dependents, (AMC airlift or travel only).
     3.6.4. Consecutive overseas tours (COT)/In-place (IPCOT).
     3.6.5. Renewal agreement travel (RAT).

3.7. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel. The local military personnel flight (MPF) or civilian
personnel flight (CPF) identifies all PCS travel needs for military members, civilian employees and their
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                    39


dependents, and submits the port call request on an AF Form 1546, Request for Flight Surface Reserva-
tions, or a locally generated form, to the servicing TMF. This request should be submitted NLT 90 days
prior to the member’s projected departure date. The TMF/CTO secures travel reservations and provides
confirmed flight or ship information back to the servicing MPF or CPF.
   3.7.1. It is Air Force policy to offer PCS travelers confirmed port call reservations optimally 60 days
   and minimally 45 days prior to departure from the old PDS. Delays may impose personal hardships
   for service members or civilian employees and their family members. When the AMC Passenger Res-
   ervation Center (PRC) is unable to confirm a reservation within a reasonable period of time or the
   member begins to experience hardships associated with not having a confirmed port call, the TMF
   should obtain commercial airline reservations to meet mission requirements. However, the TMF must
   ensure that DoD 4500.54-G or other directives do not otherwise restrict such travel. The guidelines for
   order of precedence must be followed.
   3.7.2. The gaining and losing commanders are responsible for de-conflicting reporting dates for
   members to maximize use of Patriot Express missions. The MPF provides PCS data sheets to both
   commanders and if signed by the loosing commander, the port call may be changed and processed.
   The MPF or CPF initiates changes or cancellations for all port calls.
   3.7.3. When concurrent travel is authorized, it must be included in the member’s PCS order. Family
   members with concurrent travel approval in their sponsor’s PCS orders, but electing to delay their
   travel over 120 days after the member departs, lose their concurrent travel status and non-concurrent
   dependent travel orders must be published by the servicing MPF.
   3.7.4. All Air Force members, Air Force civilians, and family members are required to obtain govern-
   ment-procured transoceanic travel through the TMF/CTO. TMF/CTO must use DoD owned, -con-
   trolled or -contracted aircraft move travelers to, from and within overseas areas, when available.
   Self-procurement of transoceanic official travel is not authorized unless specifically approved prior to
   travel.

3.8. Early Return of Dependents (ERD) Travel (JFTR, par. U5900 and JTR par. C7003-D). T h e
installation commander may authorize return of OCONUS command-sponsored dependents or the com-
manding officer designated by the Service Secretary concerned. Normally, requests are initiated by the
sponsor and subject to approval on a case-by-case basis. Travel entitlement is limited from OCONUS to
the place specified in the travel order.

3.9. Noncommand Sponsored Dependents. Reference DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 2, paragraph C2.2.3.2.

3.10. Circuitous Travel (JFTR, par. U5116-E and JTR, pars. C2206 and C3104-Dle). The Air Force
defines circuitous travel as any route other than the one that would normally be prescribed by the TMF
between places listed in members travel orders (JFTR and JTR, Appendices A). Members requesting cir-
cuitous travel are required to pay excess costs (if any) compared to the cost the government would have
paid over the TMF/CTO prescribed travel route. Use Attachment 3 to make your request. The following
are guidelines and examples for approval of circuitous routing:
   3.10.1. Military members and their command-sponsored dependents may obtain approval for circui-
   tous travel in connection with PCS travel (including separations and retirements) to, from, between
   and within OCONUS areas only. The circuitous routing authorization does not extend to other types
   of official travel (e.g., TDY, student travel, renewal agreement travel, emergency leave, etc.).
40                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


     3.10.2. Command-sponsored dependents may accompany the member on the approved circuitous
     route or travel independently.
     3.10.3. The authorizing official may approve circuitous travel for any travel performed on ERD,
     IPCOT, and deferred COT travel orders. If orders are generated through MPF, members must formally
     apply for circuitous travel. If generated at the unit level, member must obtain unit commander’s
     approval prior to requesting travel. The TMF/CTO must ensure circuitous travel routing is authorized
     in orders before issuing travel documents.
     3.10.4. Circuitous routing must not be used to relocate dependents overseas when the sponsor is
     assigned to a restricted, remote or isolated area. NOTE: This does not apply to designated-location
     moves.
     3.10.5. Space-available travel may be used in conjunction with space-required travel as long as
     space-available travel does not substitute for any single leg for which the traveler has a space-required
     entitlement. Reference DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 6.
     3.10.6. Travelers assume responsibility for all costs exceeding the normally prescribed route by local
     TMF/CTO.
     3.10.7. Authorized travelers may self-procure all commercial tickets, including the transoceanic por-
     tion in accordance with the approved (indicated in orders) circuitous routing. Reimbursement must be
     limited to the cost of normal direct point-to-point routing for official travel. Reference paragraph 2.4.
     for foreign-flag carrier rules.
     3.10.8. Requesting and processing circuitous travel. To apply for circuitous travel, the member must
     formally submit a request for application through the MPF to the TMF/CTO.
        3.10.8.1. Members stationed overseas must submit circuitous travel request at least 120 days
        before their Date of Eligibility for Return from Overseas (DEROS).
        3.10.8.2. Members departing CONUS for overseas assignment should submit circuitous travel
        request, at a minimum, 90 days before departure and prior to issuance of orders.
        3.10.8.3. Circuitous travel may be approved when it is in the best interest of the member’s morale
        and welfare, and the applicant indicates that he/she has sufficient funds to defray the costs of that
        part of the travel, which the government does not pay.
        3.10.8.4. The TMF/CTO must perform a cost comparison from the old PDS to the new PDS or
        TDY enroute versus the circuitous route, and recommend approval of request on an individual
        basis. The TMF must then forward the information to the member's MPF for final authorization
        and inclusion in the member’s PCS travel orders.
     3.10.9. Approval authority for circuitous travel resides with the servicing MPF with assistance being
     provided from the TMF/CTO. The TMF/CTO must calculate the cost comparison and provide it to the
     MPF. The servicing MPF places the approved authority for circuitous travel in the member’s PCS
     travel order. See Attachment 3.
     3.10.10. The member is responsible for the following:
        3.10.10.1. When circuitous travel is desired, ensure approval is annotated in PCS orders (includ-
        ing ERD, IPCOT and deferred COT) prior to traveling.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     41


       3.10.10.2. Travelers may procure circuitous travel from the CTO, or directly procure airline tick-
       ets from other source when approved by the TMO. The MPF must place a statement in the orders
       authorizing self-procurement.
       3.10.10.3. If the member is authorized circuitous travel and chooses to travel by other modes
       (e.g., ship, rail, etc.), the member will receive reimbursement up to the authorized cost of the nor-
       mal route as stated in the PCS travel order (including ERD, COT, and deferred COT).
       3.10.10.4. Travel time in excess of normal routing is chargeable as leave.
       3.10.10.5. The member and/or their dependents are responsible for complying with all border
       clearance requirements outlined in the DoD 4500.54-G for countries visited.
       3.10.10.6. The member and/or their dependents must maintain copies of all travel documents to
       support voucher requests for reimbursement up to the government cost.
       3.10.10.7. Transoceanic travel must be by U.S. flag carrier or by foreign flag carrier under a US
       code-share agreement. For more information on foreign-flag carriers see paragraph 2.4.
       3.10.10.8. Reimbursement for travel on a foreign flag carrier is authorized if U.S. flag carriers are
       not available on the direct/normal route and not available on the circuitous route between the old
       and new permanent duty stations. (See JFTR, par. U5116-E3 and JTR, pars. C2204-B and
       C2205-F) NOTE: TMF/CTO must provide non-U.S. flag carrier availability statement prior to
       dates of travel.

3.11. Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) and In-Place COT Travel (JFTR, par. U7200). E l i g i b l e
members and their dependents are authorized travel and transportation for leave, at government expense,
between COT or IPCOT. Air Force members and family members may travel to their home of record
(HOR) or to any other point not to exceed the cost of travel to the HOR. Because this is Government
funded travel, use of GSA Airline City Pairs Program is authorized. The use of tour packages is prohib-
ited. Tour packages are expressly for leave travel and are not to be procured with appropriated funds.
Members should visit their local MPF to determine COT entitlements and eligibility.

3.12. Transoceanic Travel by Ship (DoD 4500.9-R; JFTR, par. U3130; and JTR, par. C2205). T h e
TMF must book travel on Military Sealift Command (MSC) controlled ocean-going ships through HQ
MTMC/MTOPT-CP when they are authorized and available. On ships with two or more accommodation
classes, use the lowest class accommodations available.
   3.12.1. Military dependents may use ship transportation at government expense for PCS travel when
   they have verification of a medical condition precluding travel by air. Military members may accom-
   pany their dependents when any one of the dependents is approved to use surface travel. If the verifi-
   cation is from a civilian physician, a government physician must also verify the need for surface
   travel.
   3.12.2. Civilian employees or their dependents may use ship transportation at government expense
   for PCS travel when they have verification of a medical condition precluding travel by air. If the veri-
   fication is from a civilian physician, a government physician must also verify the need, for ship travel.
   3.12.3. The orders-issuing authority or authorizing official must include authorization for ship move-
   ment in the travel order. The TMF/CTO must instruct travelers to meet the port call and have pass-
42                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


     ports, visas, immunization records, etc., in their possession before they begin travel. The member
     must satisfy all border clearance requirements and obtain necessary travel and entry documents.

3.13. Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) Travel Involving a Car Ferry. Per diem and reimburse-
ment entitlements can be found in the JFTR, par. U5116-C3 and JTR, par. C2156. POC travel of this type
does not exhaust the POV shipping entitlement in the JFTR, par. U5400 for a uniformed member. (Please
see JTR, par. C11003 for employees.)

3.14. Alaska Marine Highway System. The Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS) is an oceango-
ing car ferry service for transporting passengers, baggage, vehicles, and pets between the states of Wash-
ington and Alaska. Reservations may be arranged by the local CTO, or by contacting AMHS, phone at
1-800-642-0066 or (907) 465-3941, or mail at P.O. Box 2535, Juneau, AK 99802-5535. The primary
method of payment is the government travel card (GTC). Government transportation requests (GTR, SF
1169) must be used as a last resort for AMHS. Reimbursement is limited to costs to move the member,
authorized dependents, and a POV (pet shipments not included). Fees for use of the AMHS to transport
one POV to a new PDS are reimbursable under JFTR, par. U5116-C3c. Reimbursement of these fees does
not preclude use of the POV shipping entitlement authorized in the JFTR, par. U5410 for uniformed mem-
bers. (See JTR, par. C11003 for employee’s shipping entitlement.)

3.15. Pet Shipments. Pet shipment on AMC flights is limited to two pets per family in permanent change
of station status only. The traveler is responsible for all expenses related to the pet shipment and must
comply with the carrier regulations. Reimbursement for shipping a pet is not authorized. The member
may be reimbursed up to $550 for mandatory pet quarantine incident to PCS. Also, the traveler must
ensure all general entry and health requirements are met prior to pet shipment. The TMF/CTO must assist
with scheduling pets on AMC airlift. The combined weight of pet and container up to 150 pounds must be
charged as excess checked baggage. The average cost of excess baggage is $90 and varies depending on
the AMC channel and destination. AMC restricts weight for pets with kennels (container) up to 150
pounds. If pet spaces are unavailable or the pet exceeds weight restrictions (to include kennel/container),
the traveler is solely responsible for shipping the pet with a commercial airline carrier. Non-availability of
AMC pet space is not grounds for members to deviate from the DoD order of precedence outlined in para-
graph 2.3. Reference DoD 4500-9-R, Part I, Chapter 103, paragraph J1. Pets defined as cats or dogs only.

3.16. Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Air is the primary transportation mode for DoD personnel. Sur-
face transportation may be approved by orders issuing/approval official or a competent authority for oper-
ational requirements (e.g., mission must be performed on a ship, medical, etc.), not for personal
conveniences.
     3.16.1. TDY travel should originate from the most rate-favorable point serving the member’s duty
     station or place ordered to duty to obtain the best value travel arrangements for mission accomplish-
     ment. Travel orders must specify where authorized travel may originate and list all official travel seg-
     ments. For privately owned conveyance travel refer to JFTR, Chapter 3, Part D or JTR, Chapter 2,
     Part D. NOTE: Circuitous travel is not part of TDY entitlements and is not authorized at government
     expense.
     3.16.2. The home station TMF makes round trip reservations and issues travel documents when the
     TDY is 30 days or less. When the TDY exceeds 30 days, the TDY location must schedule return res-
     ervations and issue all travel documents. In extenuating circumstances, the origin station may issue
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                   43


   tickets. The TMF should brief traveler on the responsibilities of safeguarding travel documents and
   the consequences of losing tickets. (this AFI, paragraph 1.16.5.)
   3.16.3. Reasonable adjustments to the traveler’s schedule must be made by travelers and their orders
   issuing official to ensure maximum utilization of Patriot Express airlift for transoceanic travel. The
   traveler must review mission needs and validate the reason for non-use of Patriot Express airlift in
   writing to the TMF (Attachment 2). Unit commanders/authorizing officials must review and approve
   all travel requests.
   3.16.4. Bearing in mind that the use of CTO is mandatory DoD policy, the squadron commander or
   equivalent authority must approve authorization to self-procure transoceanic transportation with suffi-
   cient justification. Approval authority must not be delegated. TMF must provide a statement only if
   the traveler’s official travel requirements cannot be satisfied. Orders must be annotated with the fol-
   lowing statement: “Traveler authorized to personally procure transoceanic transportation.” (Reference
   AFI 65-103, paragraph 3.3.16)

3.17. Funded Emergency Leave (EL) Travel. When eligible members and dependents permanently
assigned to an OCONUS location receive notification of a family emergency away from their duty station
they may request travel orders to the emergency location. Once the member’s commander or the dele-
gated authority has determined emergency travel is authorized, the member and/or family member(s) are
entitled to government funded round-trip transportation in accordance with JFTR, par. U7205. Refer to
DoD 4500.9-R, Part 1, Figure 102-2 to make a determination on emergency travel authorizations and enti-
tlements. See AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, for specific guidelines. NOTE: Members and
employees on TDY and in certain instances members and dependents stationed in the CONUS may have
an emergency leave entitlement. Different entitlements apply to emergency leave; consult the DoD
4500.9-R and JFTR or JTR for specifics.
   3.17.1. When AMC contracted airlift is not available, commercial air must be used. Do not delay the
   EL traveler(s) pending available Patriot Express missions.
   3.17.2. Clarification for authorized origins and destinations can be found in the JFTR, pars. U7205
   and U7206, and JTR, par. C6455, and must be used to determine all authorized entitlements.
   3.17.3. Reference DoD 4515.13-R, Table 2-1 when travel is on a DoD-owned or -controlled aircraft
   to determine eligibility and privileges.
   3.17.4. When transiting the CONUS to travel from one overseas theater to another overseas theater,
   travel will be at government expense.

3.18. Funded Dependent Student Travel. Eligible uniformed service members and employees sta-
tioned overseas are authorized round-trip transportation for their student dependents attending formal
education programs, to include vocational education. An annual trip for educational travel is one
round-trip at anytime within a fiscal year (1 Oct through 30 Sep). Uniformed service members need to
contact their personnel office for program details. NOTE: The dependent student transportation entitle-
ment does not apply to cadets attending service academies as stated in JFTR, par. U5243. Also see JTR,
par. C7005.
   3.18.1. The overseas MPF must issue travel orders with fund citations for authorized student travel.

3.19. Renewal Agreement Travel (RAT). Civilian employees who are eligible for Renewal Agreement
Travel (RAT) must obtain official travel orders from their servicing personnel office stating authorized
travel location. Employees may select an alternate point, but must be stated in the orders. However, travel
to the alternate point cannot exceed the authorized cost for travel between the old PDS and the place of
actual residence and return to the old or new PDS as the case may be. Multiple alternate points are not
authorized. Employees must arrange travel through the TMF/CTO. Reference the JTR, Chapter 4, Part D,
for guidance.

3.20. Invitational Travel Orders (ITOs). Invitational travel is official travel primarily involving
non-governmental personnel, including spouses and other family members as stated in JTR/JFTR,
Appendix E. If approved, the CTO/TMF must arrange official travel for individuals traveling on ITOs
IAW the procedures in paragraph 2.1. Commander, MAJCOM; Commander, Intermediate Echelon; and
Commander of a Wing, Group or Squadron may issue ITOs when delegated by the responsible major air
command (see JTR, par. C3000). Requests for travel approval should be submitted at least 20 working
days prior to the anticipated date of travel. All requests must be forwarded through appropriate channels
in the same manner as requests for exception to policy. NOTE: The approval process may be different
when use of MilAir is desired (see DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 10).

3.21. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Travel. DoD personnel whose travel is funded by Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) case money provided by a foreign government are bound by the normal routing for DoD
travelers, unless otherwise stated in the U.S. Government, Letter of Offer and Agreement. These terms
must be annotated on the travel orders; otherwise the TMF must procure transportation according to the
order of precedence as specified in Chapter 2, paragraph 2.3., producing the best value for expending
funds. Refer to AFMAN 16-101, Internal Affairs and Security Assistance Management, for more infor-
mation.
     3.21.1. FMS-funded travel is chargeable directly to the FMS funds shown in the travel orders. In
     addition, FMS travel that is not funded by the U.S. Government is eligible for GSA Airline City Pair
     Program fares when the traveler is a DoD uniformed service member or a DoD civilian. Contractors
     may not use city pair fares.

3.22. Transporting Human Remains, Escorts, and Relatives of Personnel Attending Group Buri-
als. TMFs and mortuary affair officers satisfy travel provisions in AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Pro-
gram, JFTR, Chapters 4, 5, & 7, and JTR, Chapter 6. TMFs must work closely with mortuary affairs for
arranging transportation of human remains. Government aircraft is normally used to move human remains
between OCONUS points or to the CONUS aerial port of debarkation (APOD), and in certain overseas
locations, commercial air cargo must be used. The normal mode for movement of human remains within
CONUS is commercial air or other means that meet specific requirements.
     3.22.1. Escorts (military or civilian) for the remains of deceased Air Force military personnel or their
     family members are authorized travel as provided in the JFTR, par. U7601.
     3.22.2. Escorts (military or civilian) for the remains of deceased civilian personnel are authorized
     travel expenses as provided in the JTR, par. C6062.

3.23. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). IMAs may use GSA Airline City Pair Program fares
when traveling to perform Inactive Duty Training. DoDI 4515.16, Use of General Services Administra-
tion (GSA) Contracts for Air Passenger Transportation Services (GSA City Pair Program) for Attendance
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     45


at Inactive Duty (IDT) Assemblies, and HQ USAF/ILT Message R191135Z Nov 99 outline these proce-
dures. Reference http://arpc.afrc.af.mil/orders/travel.htm for more information.

3.24. Ready Reserves Called to Active Duty. Members of the Air Force Reserves and Air National
Guards coordinate travel arrangements when they receive orders to perform active duty. The TMF/CTO
provides round trip reservations for members on DoD –owned, -controlled, or –contracted aircraft when
DoD service is not available to meet civilian employment commitments.

3.25. Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF) Employees. NAF military members and U.S. civilian NAF
officials or employees performing official travel on orders are mandatory users of GSA Airline City Pair
Program and must follow the order of precedence for air travel as stated in paragraph 2.3. Non-U.S. citi-
zen employees of NAF activities are authorized NAF funded transportation in overseas areas in accor-
dance with the terms of the employment contract. NAF travelers may travel on MilAir or contracted
aircraft when issued NAF travel orders. NAF contractors may not travel on ITOs and cannot use GSA
Airline City Pairs fares. See DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 2 for additional information.

3.26. Contractor Travel. Government contractors may travel by MilAir and AMC contracted chartered
aircraft when issued a Letter of Identification (LOI) and are eligible under DoD 4515.13- R, Chapter 2,
paragraph B.9. See JTR/JFTR, Appendix E, Part I, for requirements when issuing an LOI.
Government contractors are prohibited from using GSA Airline City Pair Program fares. Contractors may
submit an LOI to a vendor for a discount on rail, hotel/motel or car rental. However, the vendor is under
no obligation to give the contractor a government discount. Some carriers may offer a reduced airfare.

3.27. Air Force Aero-Club Aircraft or Other Fly-It-Yourself Rental Aircraft. Use of rental aircraft
must be approved in the travel order IAW AFI 65-103. The TMF is not required to make arrangements for
such services but should brief travelers on authorized reimbursements according to JFTR, par. U3210 and
JTR, par. C4703-B.

3.28. Accompanied Baggage. Accompanied baggage is the free checkable baggage authorized for
movement with a traveler as part of their transportation ticket. Transportation of baggage by air is limited
to the amount authorized to carry free by the air carrier. An industry standard for free baggage allowance
consists of two checked pieces (not to exceed 70 pounds each) and one carry-on piece that can be securely
stowed in the passenger compartment aboard the aircraft. Baggage allowance rules for international travel
on foreign carriers vary by country and may authorize less weight and use kilograms to monitor weight
versus pounds. Verify weight restrictions and the weight of your baggage with the airline before traveling.
   3.28.1. Excess accompanied baggage must be approved by the orders issuing official and annotated
   in the traveler’s orders, IAW AFI 65-103, AFI 65-109 and AFI 36-2102. Travel orders must be anno-
   tated with the following statement, “___pieces, ___lbs. excess accompanied baggage authorized.”
   Travelers must pay the excess baggage charges directly to the servicing airline at the time of flight
   check-in and claim reimbursement on the travel voucher. The preferred payment for excess baggage is
   the government travel card. The traveler may also elect to mail the excess baggage at any U.S. postal
   office and file for reimbursement (See DoD 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 103-F.1; JFTR, pars. U3015
   and U4520; and JTR, pars. C2302, C4705-A and C4709.)
   3.28.2. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) security regulations generally prohibit travelers from
   carrying operable weapons in the passenger compartment of civil aircraft during peacetime. Individ-
46                                                        AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


     ual airlines may grant exceptions to their regulations when a traveler requires a weapon for official
     duties during flight. The TMF/CTO must contact the appropriate carrier when coordinating flight res-
     ervations to ensure authorized personnel may bring weapons aboard.
     3.28.3. Code of Federal Regulations 14, Chapter 108, Part 108.11 permits carriers to allow DoD trav-
     elers to carry weapons in passenger compartments when the entire civil aircraft is chartered or con-
     tracted for the military services during contingency operations or for training exercises.
     3.28.4. Commercial airlines may permit travelers to transport government-owned weapons and
     ammunition in baggage compartments when CTO or TMF notifies the carrier in advance. Ammuni-
     tion for individual weapons cannot be transported in checked baggage or as a carry-on on board AMC
     Patriot Express missions departing AMC gateways. Ammunition must be certified and shipped as
     freight from military installations.

3.29. Vehicle Rental. The base CTO/TMF is responsible for obtaining rental vehicles for official travel
when authorized in the traveler’s orders. They reserve the most economical vehicle that can satisfy the
traveler’s official requirement. The CTO will consider rental vehicles under the HQ MTMC Car Rental
Agreement when making the reservations.
     3.29.1. In the United States and several foreign countries limited collision insurance is available to
     travelers at no additional charge under the HQ MTMC Car Rental Agreement. Personal accident
     insurance, personal effects coverage, or other optional coverage may be offered to the renter but is not
     a prerequisite for renting a vehicle, and its cost is not reimbursed. In countries where theft insurance is
     a mandatory charge, those charges can be shown separately from the rental rate and collision damage
     waiver charges. Outside of the United States (and outside non-foreign OCONUS areas), travelers may
     be reimbursed for these additional charges if the insurance is required by the rental agency to provide
     full coverage insurance. In foreign OCONUS areas, travelers may be reimbursed for additional man-
     datory insurance coverage charges. Reimbursement may also be authorized for certain classified spe-
     cial operations.
     3.29.2. Air Force travelers on official business who rent vehicles at an overseas location may need an
     international driver's license, which they can obtain from most automobile clubs.
     3.29.3. The traveler must coordinate use of rental vehicles for other than official business with the
     rental car companies. Any additional charges or requirements for collision insurance are the sole
     responsibility of the traveler.
     3.29.4. Damage to rental vehicles. Requests for payment for damage to vehicles rented pursuant to
     orders are approved by the orders authorizing official. The requests may be from the traveler or from
     the rental company. Prior to acting, the orders authorizing official forwards the request to the Staff
     Judge Advocate for review. The package should contain the documents outlined in the DoD Financial
     Management Regulation, Volume 9, Chapter 4.

3.30. Frequent Flyer Program Benefits. Government travelers on official business at government
expense that are frequent flyer program members may keep points or miles, upgrades, or access to carrier
clubs or facilities for personal use. The promotional material must be obtained under the same terms as
those offered to the general public and must be at no cost to the government. Air Force personnel when
using their frequent flyer miles to upgrade to business or first class shall not wear a uniform or allow a
rank or grade to be associated with an upgrade.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                      47


3.31. Multiple Airports Servicing CONUS Origins/Destinations. Passengers should not be routed to
an airport farther away from origin or destination airports based solely on a lower airfare. When arranging
transportation, TMF must route passengers using the best value that meets mission requirements within
established guidelines. Per diem, travel time, most direct route, authorized GSA contract carrier versus
alternate carrier/airport, and rental car costs should be considered in factoring best value. If a traveler’s
request does not follow the order of precedence for travel in paragraph 2.3. or the airfare is more expen-
sive, the TMF must require the traveler to provide a mission impact statement (Attachment 2) approved
and signed by the traveler’s unit commander or designated representative.

3.32. Unique Control Numbers (UCN). Upon confirming reservations, GATES automatically assigns a
UCN for travelers. The TMF/CTO annotates travel orders as required in DoD 4500.9-R for travel aboard
AMC international airlift. A local UCN register must be maintained by the TMF on a fiscal year basis.
   3.32.1. The UCN is annotated on four copies of the travel order in the upper left hand corner and is
   distributed as follows:
       3.32.1.1. TMF retains one station file copy.
       3.32.1.2. Two copies to the member, one to turn in at the AMC terminal prior to travel and the
       other one to file with their travel voucher.
       3.32.1.3. TMF forwards a copy to the local FSO for TDY travelers only.

3.33. Travelope/Passenger Checklist . The TMF/CTO must brief all travelers concerning applicable
flight information at the time tickets are issued. Use of the PNR, invoice, travelope, passenger checklist or
any locally developed form. (see DoD 4500-9-R, Figure 103-4) is highly recommended (Attachment 4
may be used for this purpose).

3.34. Travel on Military Aircraft (MilAir). Patriot Express is an AMC-contracted commercial air ser-
vice and is not considered MilAir. MilAir, often provided by Operational Support Airlift (OSA) travel is
a premium mode involving high cost and limited resources (reference paragraph 3.37.). MilAir is used for
high-priority missions and movement of passengers and cargo to meet mission sensitive requirements.
MilAir should not be used when commercial air, including AMC-contracted (Patriot Express) service, is
able to meet the traveler’s departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24-hour period. Exceptions that
would make commercial air transportation impractical would include an unusual circumstance that pre-
sents a clear and present danger, an emergency exists, use of MilAir is more cost-effective than commer-
cial air, or other similar compelling operational considerations.
   3.34.1. Required Use MilAir Travelers. The following are "required use" MilAir travelers (as defined
   in DoDD 4500.56) due to their continuous requirement for secure communications, security reasons
   or for responsive transportation to satisfy exceptional scheduling requirements dictated by frequent
   short-notice travel, making commercial transportation unacceptable:
       3.34.1.1. The President of the United States
       3.34.1.2. The Secretary of Defense
       3.34.1.3. The Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff
       3.34.1.4. The Deputy Secretary of Defense
       3.34.1.5. Secretaries of the Military Departments
48                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


        3.34.1.6. Vice Chairman and Joint Chief of Staff
        3.34.1.7. Commanders of the Unified and Specified Commands
        3.34.1.8. Four-star general/flag officers. NOTE: Retired four-star general/flag officers traveling
        on official DoD business are not “required use” travelers. Requests for other individuals to be
        either temporarily or permanently designated as “required users” should be forwarded through
        MAJCOM and Air Staff channels to the Secretary of Defense.
     3.34.2. Use DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request, to obtain and document airlift
     support. Members may not make back-up commercial reservations when travelers have requested any
     type of MilAir support. (Prohibition of Dual Commitment reference 3.1.)

3.35. MilAir Payment . TMF/CTO must ensure all travel orders contain a Customer Identification Code
(CIC). The 15-digit CIC code is required by AMC for billing purposes. For contractor billing procedures,
reference DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 2, paragraph B.9.C. For non-DoD traveler billing procedures, refer-
ence the non-DoD tariff rates in GATES or the web site at U.S. Government DoD Airlift Rates and
Non-U.S. Government Airlift Rates https://www.amcfm.scott.af.mil/FMB.htm. In cases where a CIC is
unavailable, the complete billing address must be annotated in the travel order for AMC billing purposes.

3.36. Opportune Airlift. This is a generic term for all MilAir not otherwise classified as OSA, Special
Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM), AMC channel, Special Airlift Mission (SAM), etc. It is space-avail-
able, non-revenue generating SAAM traffic. Use the procedures in DoD 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix A
and B for requesting a SAAM.
     3.36.1. Users may submit an unsupported travel requirement to their SAAM validator. They may also
     find their own MilAir (e.g., ANG, AFRES, operational, etc.) and submit the mission for validation to
     their SAAM validator.
     3.36.2. The SAAM validator submits all opportune requests in the same manner as they would a
     funded SAAM request with the following exceptions:
        3.36.2.1. Address to USCINCTRANS SCOTT AFB IL//TCJ3-OD//.
        3.36.2.2. Include USCINCTRANS SCOTT AFB IL//TCJ3-ODJ// and HQ AMC TACC SCOTT
        AFB IL//SAAMS/XOOMO/XOOMS// as info message addressees.
        3.36.2.3. Place /-/ in the billing field on the message.
        3.36.2.4. Place UNFUNDED TRANSPORTATION REQUEST in the remarks field on the mes-
        sage and follow it with any other pertinent information.

3.37. Operational Support Airlift (OSA). OSA is a form of MilAir. See DoDD 4500.43 and DoDD
4500.56
     3.37.1. The SecAF and Air Force four-star generals are “required use” travelers when requesting
     OSA. Travelers must document their travel on DD Form 2768 and sign their own request as the senior
     traveler and as the authorizing official.
     3.37.2. OSA travel request for all other general officers and member of the Senior Executive Service
     (SES) must be approved in advance. Travel authorizing officials are:
        3.37.2.1. AF/CV for Air Staff two-letter principals
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     49


       3.37.2.2. Air Staff two-letter principals for those under their supervision
       3.37.2.3. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders may delegate this approval authority in writing, but
       no lower than their Vice Commander.
   3.37.3. When an authorizing official is absent from the installation or otherwise not available, the per-
   son acting in the capacity of the authorizing official may be authorized to sign as travel authorizing
   official.
   3.37.4. Each MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and HQ USAF DCS selects one office (normally in the trans-
   portation, administrative or operational functional area) to act as OSA validator for the entire organi-
   zation.
   3.37.5. OSA validator training is available through the Joint Airlift Logistics Information System
   (JALIS) Training Organization Registrar, Scott AFB, IL.

3.38. Common User Airlift on Operational Support Aircraft (OSA) Missions . Common User Airlift
may support OSA group travel requirements (e.g., CAPSTONE, TOPS IN BLUE, CIVIC LEADER
PROGRAMS) and other validated OSA missions. The Air Force supports such missions and other travel
requirements as Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). The following exception applies to CAP-
STONE CONUS Field Trip Travel only: "When CAPSTONE fellows are moved aboard mobility aircraft
for the purpose of demonstrating the capabilities of the aircraft and the enroute support structure, the
point-to-point transportation of the fellows becomes incidental to the capability demonstration. Therefore,
use of training missions in this case is appropriate. Training flights used to carry CAPSTONE fellows
should not include repetitive sorties on which the fellows are seeing similar elements of the Air Mobility
Mission."
   3.38.1. Essential Air Mobility activities on such capability demonstration sorties (e.g.,
   Intra-Inter-Theatre airlift, Airdrops, and Air Refueling) provide aircrews the opportunity to fulfill
   training requirements. On those capability demonstration missions identified by AMC for each CAP-
   STONE course, training missions must be logged using training hours. All CAPSTONE missions are
   handled as SAAMs for the purposes of command and control in order to ensure the success of these
   high-priority/visibility missions.
   3.38.2. MAJCOMS, in coordination with users, must program funds for group travel missions they
   sponsor, including civic leader groups. AMC must also POM for NON-MAJCOM group travel
   SAAM requirements such as DoD, HQ USAF, and other NON-MAJCOM sponsored OSA missions

3.39. Customs and Border Clearance. OCONUS travelers must meet all customs and border clearance
requirements. Travelers must have passports, visas, immunization records and all other required travel
documentation in their possession before they begin their travel. See DoD 4500.54-G, DoD 5030.49-R,
AFI 24-401, AFI 24-402, AFI 24-403, and AFI 24-404 for further guidance.

3.40. Security Considerations for OCONUS Travel. Security of DoD travelers overrides all other
routing considerations. See DoD 4500.54-G for guidance.

3.41. Entitlement Extensions for Retirements and Separations. Extension requests beyond estab-
lished entitlement expirations must clearly demonstrate hardship circumstances for the uniformed service
member and/or dependents. A written justification along with supporting documentation (i.e., proof of
50                                                      AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


home of record, place of entry, medical, educational, training, spousal employment, housing, etc) is
required. Forward extension requests to the following, based on the subject.
     3.41.1. The Joint Personal Property Shipping Office, San Antonio (JPPSO-SAT) is the extension
     approval authority for household goods when a member is hospitalized, receiving medical treatment,
     home of record (HOR), place from which called or ordered to active duty (PLEAD), or for education
     and training purposes.


                Mailing Address:       JPPSO San Antonio/ECAF-B
                                       613 Northwest Loop 410, Suite 400
                                       San Antonio, TX 78216-5518


     3.41.2. HQ AF/DPPTT is the extension approval authority for other deserving cases (e.g. construc-
     tion of retirement home).


                Mailing Address: HQ AFPC/DPPTT,
                                       550 C Street West, Suite 11
                                       Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4713



3.42. Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) Claims. Under Title 31, US Code, Section
3702, DOHA settles travel and transportation claims for members of the uniformed services. Prior to July
1996, the General Accounting Office settled such claims under that statute. The Accounting and Finance
Office is the point of contact for all DOHA claims.

3.43. Application for Correction of Military Record. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Record (AFBCMR) is established under the authority contained in Title 10, US Code, Section 1552. This
statutory authority is the highest administrative appeal in the USAF for reimbursing official travel and
transportation claims including DOHA rulings when justified. The final determination is based on the
information submitted to the AFBCMR, and each case is decided only after careful consideration of the
evidence presented, with the burden of proof resting on the applicant. MPF is the POC for processing DD
Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record.

3.44. Instructions to Travelers . TMF/CTO gives travelers essential travel information on the follow-
ing:
     3.44.1. Traveler's responsibility for safeguarding, handling, and using all travel documents including
     GTRs (SF 1169), carrier tickets, and meal tickets as applicable.
     3.44.2. Reservations, cancellations and overbooking policies.
     3.44.3. Routings, itineraries, transfer points, local transportation to include ground transportation,
     and rental vehicles.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                   51


  3.44.4. The traveler may keep promotional material including frequent flyer miles and payments
  from the carrier for voluntarily vacating a seat. Additional per diem may not be paid as a result of the
  delay in the travel in this case. See JTR, pars. C1200 and C1205, and JFTR, pars. U1200 and U1205
  for more detailed information.
  3.44.5. The traveler may not keep compensation for "denied boarding” when an airline does not allow
  a traveler to board an overbooked flight the airline owes the government compensation. Travelers
  must turn in any form of compensatory payment they receive from carriers to the finance office with
  their travel voucher.
  3.44.6. Turn in any unused documents to the TMF/CTO at their permanent duty station.

                                                 Chapter 4

                            TRAVEL DOCUMENTATION AND BILLING

4.1. General. Documentation of travel with associated charges and payments is a joint responsibility of
the traveler, authorizing official, TMF, CTO and FSO. Documentation, whether in paper or electronic
form, is used for travel authorization, travel vendor charges and payments, traveler reimbursement, audit-
ing purposes, and data collection for management information system reports.
     4.1.1. In an effort to streamline travel policy and procedures, TMFs must take positive steps to elim-
     inate use of the GTR (SF Form 1169). The elimination of the GTR is consistent with efforts to reengi-
     neer the transportation documentation and financial processes and to embrace charge vehicles for
     payment of transportation services. Thus, the preferred payment method for passenger travel is the
     GTC. If, however, a GTR is used as the payment method, the policy and procedures for GTR usage at
     paragraph 4.3. must be followed.
     4.1.2. Mandatory Use of the Government Travel Card (GTC). The Travel and Transportation Act of
     1998 (Public Law 105-264) requires use of the GTC as the method of payment for official travel
     expenses. The GTC encompasses the individually billed account (IBA), the centrally billed account
     (CBA) and the Unit Card. The requirement for mandatory use of the travel card applies to uniformed
     service members, DoD civilian personnel, and members of the USAFR and ANG while in federal ser-
     vice (Title 10 status). Use of the IBA is the administratively preferred method of payment.
     4.1.3. Transportation charges are as follows.
        4.1.3.1. Transportation charges for airline, bus and rail tickets may be billed to the CBA. The
        local TMF must determine valid use of the CBA and reconciliation procedures (Attachment 6).
        4.1.3.2. The IBA is the administratively preferred method of payment for official travel associ-
        ated charges where a charge card can be used such as: ticketing, lodging, rental car, meals, etc. The
        IBA can only be used to obtain ticketing and services directly associated with official government
        funded travel.
        4.1.3.3. The Unit Card is intended for use in group travel situations. Examples are presidential
        aircrews, academy athletic teams, and bands. The unit card can be used for official charges associ-
        ated with travel.
        4.1.3.4. The traveler is required to use the CTO for making official travel arrangements and tick-
        eting if the CTO is available. When the CTO is available, but the traveler arranges transportation
        through a non-contract travel agent or common carrier direct purchase, reimbursement is limited
        to the amount the government would have paid if the arrangements had been made directly
        through a CTO. The IBA, CBA, and Unit Card are the only methods of payment to be used.
        NOTE: Self-procured official travel without prior TMF/CTO approval may result in less than full
        reimbursement.
        4.1.3.5. MAJCOM commanders may decide whether transportation charges for official transpor-
        tation travel are billed to CBAs or IBAs or a mix. MAJCOM commanders may also delegate this
        decision to their base or installation commanders.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     53


       4.1.3.6. CBA and IBA Reconciliation and Refund Procedures. The TMF, in conjunction with the
       CTO and FSO, must develop local procedures in meeting installation requirements and guidelines
       outlined by the Prompt Payment Act. See Attachment 6.

4.2. Maintaining Records. At a minimum, the TMF must retain a copy of orders and either a copy of the
ticket, passenger name record (PNR), or AF Form 529, Request for Air Carrier Services, for each trans-
action processed. Additional documentation such as justification for non-use of GSA Airline City Pair
Program fares, Patriot Express missions, etc. must also be retained. GTR and CBA ticketing documenta-
tion must be grouped and filed together for reconciliation purposes and forwarded as determined by the
supporting FSO and operating location (OPLOC).

4.3. Traffic Management Flight (TMF) Control of Government Transportation Request (GTR, (SF
1169)), Meal Tickets, Passenger Warrants. Blank GTRs (SF 1169), meal tickets, and Passenger War-
rants (formerly MTWs) are examples of accountable forms. Maintain a complete audit trail when they are
transferred. Use an automated form or AF Form 213, Receipt for Accountable Forms, to record the
name, title, and signature of the persons transferring and receiving the GTRs (SF 1169). AFI 37-161, Dis-
tribution Management, contains guidance on transferring accountable documents.
   4.3.1. TMFs must store blank GTRs (SF 1169) in a locked container.
   4.3.2. Record each GTR (SF 1169) issued on an automated form or AF Form 1332, Government
   Transportation Request and Meal Ticket/Register.
   4.3.3. Dispose of records in accordance with AFI 37-138, Records Disposition – Procedures and
   Responsibilities, and AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
   4.3.4. Do not issue GTRs (SF 1169) for the following:
       4.3.4.1. For unofficial or leisure travel.
       4.3.4.2. For preparation by individual travelers, except when the traveler is appointed as an acting
       transportation officer.
       4.3.4.3. To travel agencies. This restriction does not apply to travel agencies approved by HQ
       USAF/ILTT.
       4.3.4.4. For military furlough and leave fares.
       4.3.4.5. To members being separated or released from active duty, unless the finance office certi-
       fies separation Monetary Allowance in Lieu of Transportation (MALT) entitlements will not be
       paid. File a copy of the certification with the issued tickets.
       4.3.4.6. For transportation costs less than $50.

4.4. GTR (SF 1169) Issuance, Distribution, and Notation . Once a GTR (SF 1169) is issued, travelers,
carrier personnel, or their agents may not make changes to the face of the document. Circumstances may
require travelers to arrange for transportation or accommodations other than those shown on the reverse
side of the GTR (SF 1169). In those instances, the traveler must note the changes on the reverse side of the
GTR (SF 1169) before exchanging it for a carrier ticket. The value is not placed on the GTR (SF 1169),
only the authorized routing and fare basis. The cost is annotated on the member’s travel voucher copy of
the GTR (SF 1169), TMF file copy, and the finance copy, but not on the copy provided to the carrier.
54                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


4.5. Persons Authorized to Sign GTRs (SF 1169) in Emergencies. Any commissioned officer or
senior noncommissioned officer in the pay grades E-7 through E-9 on duty at the place of issue may sign
a GTR (SF 1169) in emergency situations when other authorized personnel are not available. The acting
agent must print and sign their name on the GTR (SF 1169) over the typed or printed name of the respon-
sible TMF.

4.6. Designation and Responsibilities of Acting Transportation Officers. Travel orders may desig-
nate a traveler as an acting transportation officer for the purpose of issuing their own GTRs (SF 1169).
Travelers receive this designation to meet official travel situations, not for personal convenience.
     4.6.1. The TMFs must brief the acting transportation officers on their responsibilities.
     4.6.2. Acting transportation officers must send the issuing office legible copies of all GTRs (SF 1169a
     and 1169c) within 5 (five) workdays of travel. Attach the GTRs (SF 1169) to the travel order.
     4.6.3. When blanket travel orders are used, acting transportation officers retain unused GTRs (SF
     1169) until the order expires. At the expiration of the travel order or end of the fiscal year, forward a
     list of all unused GTRs (SF 1169) to the TMF.

4.7. Disposing of Unused GTRs (SF 1169), Transportation Warrants, Exchange Orders, Carrier
Transportation Credit Refund Applications, and Carrier Tickets. Travelers must understand these
forms are accountable and must turn in any unused documents to the TMF/CTO at their permanent duty
station. Turn in should occur within five days to ensure proper credit is processed in a timely manner
against the government travel card. Sign and attach a statement to the ticket, indicating the date, hour and
reason for canceling or changing seating or sleeping accommodations.
     4.7.1. TMFs/CTOs receiving unused travel documents must do the following:
        4.7.1.1. Document receipt for unused tickets (Use of DD Form 730, Receipt for Unused Trans-
        portation Request and/or Tickets, Including Unused Meal Tickets, is optional).
        4.7.1.2. File the receipt per local procedures for receipt of unused tickets.
        4.7.1.3. Send the receipt, voided unused ticket(s) and other pertinent documentation to the issuing
        TMF/CTO for proper disposition.

4.8. Destroying Unused, Damaged, or Canceled Travel Documents . Mark "Canceled" or "Void"
across the face of the original unused, damaged, or canceled GTRs (SF 1169), transportation warrants, and
meal tickets. (Refer to DoD 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix L). Dispose of them in accordance with AFI
37-138 and AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule. Dispose of the remaining copies as ordinary
trash.

4.9. Reporting Tickets or GTRs (SF 1169) Lost or Stolen
     4.9.1. While in Custody of the TMF. For lost or stolen GTRs (SF 1169), the TMF sends a report
     immediately, by message, to the paying office shown on the "billed to" portion of the transportation
     procurement document. Include payee's name (if applicable), the serial number of missing documents,
     and a statement explaining the loss or theft. For loss of commercial airline tickets, TMF must file a
     lost ticket application and initiate follow-up actions, as needed.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                      55


       4.9.1.1. If lost or stolen GTRs (SF 1169) were fully or partially completed, provide the serial
       numbers to the CTO, carrier or local travel agents and advise them not to honor identified lost/sto-
       len documents. Follow-up, in writing, and forward information to the appropriate Defense Finance
       and Accounting Service (DFAS) Office.
       4.9.1.2. TMFs who have blank GTRs (SF 1169) lost or stolen while in their custody must imme-
       diately notify, in writing, their local publication distribution office (PDO), and their appropriate
       finance office (i.e., DFAS), Offutt AFB, NE 68005-1920). Give the serial number or numbers of
       the missing GTRs (SF 1169) and circumstances surrounding the loss or theft.
   4.9.2. Tickets or GTRs (SF 1169) Lost While in Custody of Traveler.
       4.9.2.1. Travelers who lose their tickets/GTR (SF 1169) must notify the carrier and issuing TMF/
       CTO immediately, and complete a carrier lost ticket refund application. Travelers must purchase
       transportation with personal funds. If travelers do not have sufficient funds, the TMF may issue a
       replacement ticket on a cost charge basis. See paragraph 4.11. for cost charge authorization proce-
       dures, and reference DoD 4500.9-R.
       4.9.2.2. After completing the travel, they may request reimbursement on their travel voucher
       upon receipt of airline non-use verification. Dependents of service members may obtain cost
       charge transportation under JFTR, par. U5237; and civilian employees under JTR, pars. C2255
       and C2256. NOTE: Civilian travelers must also ask civilian personnel for specific documentation
       needed for cost charge transportation.

4.10. Carrier’s Compliance with GTR (SF 1169). All commercial carriers must comply with informa-
tion on the GTR (SF 1169). The Air Force does not pay excess costs that may arise when the carrier devi-
ates from routes, mode, or accommodations, even though the changes may result from oral instructions.
The carrier may provide transportation or accommodations only for the exact number of persons shown
on the GTR (SF 1169).

4.11. Furnishing Transportation to Military Personnel without Funds (Cost-Charge Travel). When
members of the uniformed services report to Air Force bases without funds and need transportation to
their duty station, TMF provides cost-charge transportation.
   4.11.1. For members with PCS or TDY orders, cite the original order and appropriation shown as the
   authority. TMF initiates a DD Form 139 for member. The member receiving cost-charge transporta-
   tion must complete a certificate in triplicate, stating that they agree either to pay the cost involved or
   to authorize collection from their pay. Give the original certificate to the member and place the dupli-
   cate copy in the file with the travel documents, and forward a copy of the cost charge GTR (SF 1169),
   the DD Form 139 and orders to the appropriate finance center:
       4.11.1.1. Army personnel: DFAF Centralized Pay Operation; ATTN: JUMPS Cross-Disbursing,
       Dept. 20; Indianapolis, IN 46249-0601.
       4.11.1.2. Navy personnel: Disbursing officer of member's ship or station.
       4.11.1.3. Marine Corps personnel: Marine Corps Finance Center; Code (SD2R); Kansas City,
       MO 64197-0001.
       4.11.1.4. Coast Guard personnel: Commandant (FP), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 2nd
       St. SW, Washington, DC 20593.
56                                                        AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


     4.11.2. For members without orders, the TMF may issue transportation to active duty members with-
     out funds on ordinary leave, AWOL, deserters, and absentees, to return to their permanent duty sta-
     tion. The TMF instructs the member to go to the base MPF for orders. Also, there is a requirement for
     members on leave, AWOL, deserters, and absentees to obtain a DD Form 460, Provisional Pass, from
     the Security Forces before orders can be issued. The local MPF must issue orders containing appropri-
     ations cited by the Headquarters, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC). An officer receiving
     cost-charge transportation must sign a certificate (in triplicate) stating that they agree to pay the cost
     involved or authorize collection from their pay, give the original certificate to the member, forward a
     copy to servicing FSO, and place a copy in the file with the travel documents. See DoD 4500.9-R, Part
     I, Appendix L for more information and an example.
        4.11.2.1. Air Force members receiving a cost-charge fund cite from AFPC do not require a DD
        Form 139 because the use of AFPC fund cites automatically generates collection actions against
        the member’s pay account.

4.12. Recovered GTRs (SF 1169) . For recovered GTRs (SF 1169), TMFs must follow the procedures
specified in paragraph 4.9. Annotate the AF Form 1332 or locally developed register appropriately.

4.13. Processing Unused Tickets for Refunds. Below are the recommended procedures for processing
refunds; however, local TMF/CTO and finance office may implement a different procedure in accom-
plishing refunds.
     4.13.1. For installations without a CTO function, complete a SF 1170, Redemption of Unused Tick-
     ets, or a standard memorandum letter and attach a copy of the lost ticket refund application, if avail-
     able, and copies of the original tickets. Maintain a copy for your suspense for 120 days, and send the
     original documents to the carrier. The SF 1170 can be found on the General Service Administration
     web site.
     4.13.2. Initiate tracer action on unanswered requests for refunds on the 121st day and each 90 days
     thereafter, for up to one year from date of the initial SF 1170. If the carrier fails to respond within one
     year, forward all correspondences and documentation with the member's case file and annotate copy
     of SF 1170 with the statement, "No Response Received From Carrier," and send the information to the
     appropriate DFAS in IAW AFI 37-138.
     4.13.3. Installations serviced by a CTO. The TMF, FSO, and CTO/ticket provider jointly agree on
     refund procedures or as specified in the local performance work statement outlined by contract.
     4.13.4. The issuing office may follow the recommended procedures below in processing unused
     travel documents and ticket refunds:
        4.13.4.1. Receive unused portion of tickets and a copy of travel orders.
        4.13.4.2. Use DD Form 730 (optional) or locally developed form (e.g., PNR, stamp, pre-printed
        labels, etc.).
        4.13.4.3. Annotate form with pertinent data (e.g., unused segments, cost of unused segment,
        CBA/GTR (SF 1169) number, etc.).
        4.13.4.4. Void/cancel original unused ticket without distorting the pre-printed fare basis and ticket
        value.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                    57


       4.13.4.5. Advise traveler to file copy of receipt with travel voucher and maintain a copy for per-
       sonal records.
       4.13.4.6. Mail all unused documents issued at other installations to the issuing TMF/CTO on a
       transmittal or other means for verifying receipt of accountable forms.
   4.13.5. Recommended refund procedures:
       4.13.5.1. Create a refund suspense list of all unused tickets for the established ticketing period
       (e.g., weekly, monthly, etc.).
       4.13.5.2. As a minimum, the suspense list must contain the traveler’s name, ticket number, and
       refund amount in duplicate copies.
       4.13.5.3. Provide CTO with the original unused tickets and a copy of the suspense list for process-
       ing at the end of the billing cycle (the average refund process takes 30 - 45 days).
       4.13.5.4. The TMF must follow-up on unprocessed ticket refunds beyond 45 days.
       4.13.5.5. Upon receipt of billing documents, verify ticket refunds against TMF suspense list and
       resolve discrepancies with CTO.

4.14. Recording Fiscal Data on the GTR (SF 1169). DoD 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix L, specifies the
general fiscal data entries to make on a GTR (SF 1169) (Block 1) when a TMF issues a GTR (SF 1169) for
travel or accommodations.
   4.14.1. Send a copy of each GTR, with travel orders, to the local finance office on the day of issuance
   to verify the accounting classification. Refer any questions on propriety of accounting classifications
   to the nearest finance office.
   4.14.2. TMFs may make pen and ink changes to Element Expense Investment Codes (EEIC), (e.g.,
   409 to 421) rather than requiring an amended order.

4.15. Air Transportation Tax on International Travel. On official travel, pay this tax only when it
applies. The domestic portion of an international trip is tax-exempt when the layover at the transfer point
is less than 12 hours.
   4.15.1. This U.S. tax exemption applies to the following:
       4.15.1.1. Connections between commercial airlines at a commercial airport.
       4.15.1.2. Arrival at a commercial airport.
       4.15.1.3. Departure from an international airport.
       4.15.1.4. Departure from an AMC aerial port of embarkation (APOE).
   4.15.2. To ensure carriers extend the tax-exemption privileges to official travelers, identify the con-
   necting international flight information on the GTR (SF 1169), AF Form 529, or the PNR for the
   domestic air travel. Place the identifying data on the GTR in the "special accommodations and
   requirements" block. When using the AF Form 529 or PNR, place the data in the "itinerary" block.

4.16. Local Payment of Airlines (LOPA) Procedures. For those installations still operating under
LOPA procedures, use a single GTR (SF 1169) to buy tickets during a specific ticketing period (e.g., daily,
weekly, monthly). The TMF, finance office, and CTO/ticket provider must jointly agree on the period.
58                                                      AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005

        4.16.4.3. Ensures all documents are accurate and all tickets are properly chargeable to the GTR
        number shown on the SF 1113.
        4.16.4.4. Resolves any billing discrepancies with the CTO.
     4.16.5. An authorized TMF representative signs SF 1113 in the "Verified By" block and assembles
     the documents. Attach the following in this order:
        4.16.5.1. With the first copy of the SF 1113 attach the original copy of the GTR (SF 1169), the
        ticket listing, a copy of each PNR, and copies of the official orders (in ticket number order).
        4.16.5.2. With the second copy of the SF 1113 attach the GTR (SF 1169a), a copy of the ticket list-

                                                Chapter 6

                                 DEFENSE TRAVEL SYSTEM (DTS)

6.1. Defense Travel System . The Defense Travel System (DTS) is an initiative designed to make DoD
TDY travel quicker, easier and more efficient. The DTS is based on the Common User Interface (CUI)
and it interfaces with other DoD and commercial systems. The traveler, authorizing official (AO), CTO,
TMF, base Finance and DFAS are all connected using combinations of desk-top computers, internet, and
direct connectivity to the CUI. The system aids the intended traveler by initiating an electronic travel
request identifying desired travel arrangements incorporating Air Force and DoD travel policy, and at
travels end, submits an electronic travel voucher through the CUI. The AO reviews and approves or dis-
approves the need for travel, availability of funds based on the CUI travel estimates (“should cost”) and
appropriate travel arrangements. The CTO ensures Air Force and DoD travel policy is adhered to and pro-
vides booking of travel arrangements for all travel including airline, bus, train, lodging and car rental.
Payment of travel services is accomplished through DFAS and the CUI. DTS permits payment using the
IBA, CBA or GTR (SF 1169). The authorizing or approving official determines necessary reimbursable
expenses. DTS views the traveler and the travel authorizing or approving official as honest professionals
which allows for elimination of tremendous amounts of documentation to support each expense or excep-
tion. NOTE: DTS is in the testing and early implementation stages, with processes continually being
developed and updated. For the most current information on the DTS processes, fielding and business
practices the following web sites are available (PMO-DTS web site http://www.dtic.mil/travelink/; HQ
USAF/ILTT, Passenger Team web site http://www.il.hq.af.mil/ilt/iltt/pax1.html; and the DTS contrac-
tor (TRW) web site http://www.defensetravel.com/).
     6.1.1. Other Than TDY Travel. Travel arrangements for other than business, training, and deploy-
     ment travel must also be made through DTS; however, orders must be produced outside of the DTS
     and a travel voucher must be manually prepared for payment/reimbursement of travel arrangements
     and other related travel expenses.
     6.1.2. DTS (Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (CTO) Contractor. Travelers must arrange com-
     mercial transportation, rental cars (if authorized), and government and commercial lodging through
     the CTO. In addition to the normal CTO responsibilities, the DTS Travel Services Contractor arranges
     international government airlift under Air Mobility Command (AMC) contract/control when it is
     available and when it satisfies mission requirements. The CTO must capture, record and report Statis-
     tical Collection of Passenger Travel (STATCO) Data in accordance with DoD 4500.9-R, Part I,
     Appendix H. The CTO must make Government and commercial lodging reservations with the auto-
     mated interfaces (when available) and must document “non-availability” on trip records when appro-
     priate. The CUI must calculate a “should-cost estimate” based on traveler and CTO inputs and
     forward the information to the AO for review. Ticketing must not occur until the CTO receives
     approval from the AO.

6.2. Defense Travel Administration (DTA). The DTA is the base function that oversees the DTS opera-
tion. In the Air Force, the DTA must be made up of functional representatives from Finance, Transporta-
tion, Communications, and Personnel. How the DTA is staffed and organized is a base level decision;
however, it is expected that the DTA will be located in the base finance office and will be manned during
normal duty hours by finance personnel.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                      63


   6.2.1. The DTA function must be responsible for entering and deleting travelers from the DTS, load-
   ing funds into organizational accounts, and serving as the central point for reporting problems and
   deficiencies in the DTS system.
   6.2.2. The DTA must support the end-user on problems or questions ONLY after the traveler or AO
   has exhausted all means of solving the problem at their level. The DTA Help Desk must field prob-
   lems and questions on topics such as: software and CUI use, entitlements, travel policy issues, trans-
   action problems, pay problems, contract performance issues, etc. Many similar functions are currently
   being performed locally but individually, under manual stove-piped processes. The DTA must for-
   ward problems to the appropriate functional area for resolution. If problem resolution is beyond local
   capability, the problem must be documented and forwarded through channels for resolution.
   6.2.3. Transportation personnel must field all non-routine transportation policy issues and identify
   organizations that do not follow transportation policy standards as identified in DTS reports. Other
   responsibilities include, but are not limited to: developing expertise on transportation modes of travel
   and best use of each, providing guidance on group and individual travel, policy on Patriot Express
   travel, guidance on transportation policies and procedures, and actively communicating with the CTO,
   and base level organization representatives.

6.3. Travel Entitlement. Simplified entitlements are the basis for the entire DTS travel process. They
reflect current policy (to include transportation, finance, budget, lodging, messing, personnel, etc.), law,
and customs; and affect virtually every aspect of the travel system. A full understanding of simplified
entitlements is required. The simplified entitlements are found in the JFTR/JTR, Appendix O.

6.4. Travel Arrangements and Reimbursement Rate . Transportation arrangements must follow nor-
mal point-to-point routing. The priority order of precedence in DoD 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 103 must
be used. The CTO must route passengers using Patriot Express and city pair fares, when available. The
AO has authority to reimbursement expenses and approve exceptions to normal point-to-point routing
based on mission requirements, but must provide justification. The CTO must capture exceptions to pol-
icy and report them through the STATCO reporting system. The amount of authorized reimbursement for
airfares must be calculated using the constructed cost of normal point-to-point routing using the costs
associated with the Patriot Express, city pair, or applicable commercial fares, the same as for travelers not
using DTS.

1. Member must provide sufficient justification and approval to deviate from: the use of contract carriers
and AMC flights when available, use of a significantly higher flight cost when a lower flight cost is avail-
able at an alternate airport serving the local area, and there is any deviation from what is authorized for
TMF/CTO approval/authorization. One or more travel condition(s) must apply if a non-contract carrier or
a contract carrier other than the primary contractor is used for travel within a contract route (reference
JFTR, par. U3145).

2. Final determination rests with the orders-issuing authority and not the Traffic Management Flight/CTO.
The TMF/CTO can best determine flight availability and cost for the order-issuing authority’s decision.

                     CENTRALLY BILLED ACCOUNT (CBA) PROCEDURES

A6.1. The CBA is used as the method of payment for airline, rail and sometimes bus tickets when:
   A6.1.1. A traveler has not been issued an Individually Billed Account (IBA), commonly referred to
   as a personal Government Travel Card (GTC).
   A6.1.2. Traveling as a group.
   A6.1.3. Directed by the MAJCOM Commander/Base Commander.

A6.2. To preclude travelers from mistakenly requesting reimbursement when the CBA method of pay-
ment is used, the CTO will mark the traveler’s itinerary or ticket(s) with the method of payment. Tickets
purchased using a CBA will state, “Airline ticket(s) paid by CBA, Non-Reimbursable to Traveler.” Tick-
ets purchased using an IBA will state, “Airline Ticket(s) paid by IBA, Reimbursable to Traveler”. Note:
The Passenger Name Record (PNR) invoice should not contain the CBA or IBA number.

A6.3. Except for travel arrangements made through the Defense Travel System (DTS), the Traffic Man-
agement Flight (TMF) must maintain a copy of the PNR invoice and a copy of the travel authorization/
order for each ticket issued on the CBA. These documents should be filed either by transaction date, ticket
number or alphabetically (traveler’s name) to facilitate reconciling the CBA invoice. If the travel authori-
zation/order is processed through the DTS, there is no need to retain a copy of the PNR and travel autho-
rization because they are stored electronically within the DTS. However, optional retention of a copy of
the PNR and travel authorization for DTS transactions, appropriately filed, may simplify the reconcilia-
tion process.

A6.4. When un-used or partially used tickets are returned to the CTO/TMF, documentation is initiated
and forwarded to the airline/rail company for the appropriate refund/credit. The TMF must establish an
active suspense file identifying all travel transactions due credits/refunds from the airlines/rail companies
for tickets charged to the CBA. Tracking must be accomplished by maintaining paper copy documenta-
tion files and by spreadsheet or another quick reference product that provides current status of all credits/
refunds due. As a minimum the tracking product requires the travel order/authorization number, traveler’s
name, date a refund request was submitted, amount of credit due, and the date refund/credit was received
as identified on the Government Travel Card Vendor (GTCV) invoice report. The TMF must ensure that
credits due appear on the GTCV’s invoice report until the credit is received. A follow-up process, at least
monthly, should be established to check status of outstanding credits due.

A6.5. CBA Reconciliation Process
   A6.5.1. The GTCV forwards the paper copy of the invoice at the end of the billing cycle to the TMF.
   The paper copy GTCV invoice (bill) should be received approximately seven to ten days after the end
   of the billing cycle. When received, the invoice is date stamped. This date starts the clock for prompt
   payment. The payment due date is stated on the GTCV invoice (and is the date used for determining
   amounts past due and the account suspension date). The reconciliation should be completed and certi-
   fied by the TMF within 10 days after receipt. Note: If the paper copy invoice is not received within 10
78                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


     days after the end of the billing cycle, the TMF should contact and advise the GTCV that the invoice
     was not received.
     A6.5.2. At the end of the billing cycle the GTCV sends an electronic version of the CBA invoice to
     the CTO. The electronic version should contain the same data as the paper copy invoice sent to the
     TMF. The electronic invoice should be used to start the reconciliation rather than waiting for the paper
     copy.
     A6.5.3. The TMF may also monitor CBA transactions using the GTCV EAGLS web based program.
     A6.5.4. Based on the CTO contract, the CTO’s participation in the reconciliation process varies. The
     TMF establishes written local procedures on the CBA reconciliation process to include specific CTO
     and TMF responsibilities and time periods for accomplishment.
     A6.5.5. The CBA reconciliation process as a minimum must include the following:
        A6.5.5.1. Review of all charges and credits on the electronic version of the invoice to include:
        amount, date, passenger name, ticket number, and airline code. The CTO may make minor correc-
        tions (but not dollar amounts) and forward the updated disk and reports to the Transportation
        Officer (TO).
        A6.5.5.2. The CTO/TMF pulls the previously filed copies of refunds identified as credits on the
        invoice for use in the reconciliation process.
        A6.5.5.3. The TMF/CTO assembles a copy of each travel authorization/order and a copy of each
        PNR invoice in the same sequence as appears on the GTCV hard copy invoice.
        A6.5.5.4. The TMF is responsible for reconciling the report for payment, making sure the ticket
        number, traveler’s name, airline code and cost on the PNR invoice match the hard copy of the
        GTCV’s invoice.
        A6.5.5.5. The CTO/TMF work the unmatched transactions indicating "awaiting credit or wrong-
        ful charges" to the account. If there are missing credits/refunds or wrongful charges, the ticket
        number is researched for the traveler's name and date the ticket was issued. Ensure the appropriate
        GTCV dispute form is completed. The TMO must suspense the dispute until it is resolved with all
        parties concerned. Once resolved, the TMO must monitor the next invoice to ensure all disputes
        have been updated.
        A6.5.5.6. All transactions on the GTCV PAPER COPY invoice must be certified for payment or
        placed in dispute. TMOs should reconcile and pay everything on that specific invoice so the
        charges on the invoice and the Standard Form 1113 or Standard Form 1034 match completely. The
        only time the price for that billing cycle should be different is when the TMO disputes a charge
        and/or credit. When the credit shows up on the next months invoice, the TMO can then process the
        credit, refund or void the ticket. The TO must verify the amount being certified for payment and
        type the certification statement on the Standard Form 1113 or Standard Form 1034, sign and date
        the form.
        A6.5.5.7. The TMF/CTO must make the number of copies of the travel authorizations/orders and
        PNR invoices required by the supporting DFAS/OPLOC. The travel authorizations/orders and
        PNRs must be assembled in the proper sequence and forwarded to the DFAS/OPLOC with a paper
        copy of the GTCV’s invoice, a copy of the TO’s certified Standard Form 1113 or Standard Form
        1034 and a disk (provided by the CTO) with all of the reconciled transactions in the TTOPRS for-
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                79


       mat. Note: CBA transactions processed through DTS do not require copies of the travel authoriza-
       tions/orders and PNRs to be forwarded to DFAS/OPLOC, as they can be reviewed through the
       web. The TMF should retain a backup copy of the assembled documentation in case the documen-
       tation is lost in transit between the DFAS/OPLOC and the shipping location.

A6.6. DFAS/OPLOC should process each invoice within 10 days of receipt and make EFT payment to
the bank. This effort ensures CBA payments are received by the bank in a timely manner preventing late
payment interest penalties, and precluding account suspensions.

the traveler, the number entered will be limited to no more than the last 5 digits of the CBA number.
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                        83


2.6.3.3. The CTO notifies the TMF of all airline ticket transactions that have potential discrepancies in
authorization or billing.


2.6.3.4. The CTO only receives travel authorizations/requests from, and sends email ticket confirmations
to, ".mil" or ".gov" email addresses.


2.6.4. The CTO complies with the following when making premium class travel (PCT) accommodations
and ticketing PCT:


2.6.4.1. The Contractor does not issue PCT tickets (first class or business class) without the travel order/
authorization being documented as directed in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR U2000-A2)
and the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR C2000-A2). The travel order/authorization must specifically state
that the use of PCT is authorized/approved.


2.6.4.2. Where extenuating circumstances or emergencies situations preclude the traveler from obtaining
advance PCT authorization/approval (Ref JTR, par. C2000-A2a and JFTR, par.
U2000-A2a), after-the-fact approval is permitted. In these situations, the CTO only issues PCT tickets
when the AO places a statement on the travel order/authorization stating, "After-the-fact PCT approval is
being/will be pursued. Issuance of PCT tickets is authorized in anticipation of approval. If PCT is not
approved after-the-fact by the appropriate authorizing/approval authority, the traveler is responsible for
the cost difference between the premium class transportation used and the transportation class for which
the traveler was eligible."


2.6.4.3. If the Contractor issues PCT tickets without the travel order/authorization documentation,
PCT approval/authorization statement or the after-the-fact statement by the travel order/authorization
AO, the contractor is liable for reimbursement to the Government for the cost difference between the pre-
mium class transportation used and the transportation class for which the traveler was eligible.


2.6.4.4. Travelers are authorized to upgrade to premium class services and accommodations at personnel
expense (e.g., cash or using personal frequent traveler benefits) without obtaining PCT approval.


2.6.5. CTO requirements pertaining to fully unused tickets and partially used tickets and turn-in for
refunds.


2.6.5.1. The CTO notifies travelers that all unused and partially used tickets are of value and must be
turned in for the applicable refund.


2.6.5.2. The CTO maintains a daily log of all identified fully unused and partially used tickets.
84                                                      AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005



2.6.5.3. The CTO provides the TMF, once a month, a report of unused tickets obtained through the con-
tractor’s Global Distribution System.


2.6.5.4. The CTO identifies and cancels unused tickets 30 days after the last scheduled travel date, and ini-
tiates the ticket refund process.


2.6.5.5. The CTO processes unused ticket refund requests with the airlines.


2.6.5.6. The CTO provides the TMF with copies of all requests for refunds.


2.6.5.7. The CTO provides the TMF with the data required to complete the Unused Ticket Data and
Refund Data report. A copy of the report format is available at the AF/ILGD web site, under Unused
Ticket Issues.


2.6.6. The CTO complies with the CBA Procedures identified in Attachment 6 of this AFI and/or as
specified in the CTO contract statement of work.


2.7. Use of Premium Class Travel (PCT) Accommodations. DoD policy requires the use of least expen-
sive coach class transportation accommodations for all official travel. Travel requirements should be
determined in sufficient time to reserve coach class accommodations for members, employees and their
dependents. Advance planning to include the use of alternate travel dates or rest stops is essential to
ensure travelers comply with DoD policy. PCT accommodations may be used only when exceptional cir-
cumstances are warranted to meet mission requirements and must not be common practice. Blanket
authorization/approval of PCT is not permitted. Requests for PCT accommodations will be considered on
a case-by-case basis. PCT accommodations shall not be used for PCS travel nor for CONUS to CONUS
flights, except for those limited conditions outlined in the JFTR or JTR. When PCT is authorized/
approved it applies to the principal traveler only, unless specifically approved for other travelers in the
party. PCT upgrades are permitted without approval when there is no cost to the Government (e.g.,
through the use of cash or frequent traveler benefits). For guidance on using frequent flyer program bene-
fits for upgrade to premium class travel, see Chapter 3, paragraph 3.30. of this AFI.
2.7.1. Premium Class Travel (PCT) Categories. There are two types of PCT accommodations: first class
and premium class other than first class. Hereafter, premium class, other than first class, will be referred
to as business class in this AFI. When an airline flight has only two classes of service, the higher class of
service, regardless of the term used, is treated as first class.
2.7.1.1. PCT accommodations may be authorized/approved on an exception basis only as outlined in the
JFTR, paragraph U3125, for military personnel and their dependents and the JTR, paragraph C2204, for
DoD civilian employees, their dependents, and others traveling under Invitational Travel Authorizations
(ITAs).
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                       85


2.7.1.2. First class travel accommodations may be authorized/approved when at least one of the criteria
identified in the JTR, paragraph C2204-B3 or the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B3 is met, fully justified and
documented.
2.7.1.3. Business Class travel accommodations may be authorized/approved when at least one of the cri-
teria identified in the JTR, paragraph C2204-B4 or the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B4 is met, fully justified
and documented.
2.7.2. Premium Class Travel Authorizing/Reporting Officials. PCT can only be authorized/approved on
an exception basis. Authorizing/approving officials must consider each request for PCT accommodations
individually and carefully balance good stewardship of scarce resources with the immediacy of mission
requirements. Requests that do not clearly substantiate an exceptional mission need justifying the use of
PCT should be disapproved. To assist the traveler and the PCT authorizing/approving official in the
request/approval process, a first class and business class decision support tool is available at the AF/ILGD
web site, under Premium Class Travel Issues. NOTE: Refer also to Table 2.7.T1 at the end of this section.
2.7.2.1. Self-approval of PCT for business or first class is prohibited.
2.7.2.2. Code two and three Presidential appointees and three- and four-star general officers must now
obtain business class travel approval from a person senior to the traveler in their chain of command.
2.7.2.3. The Traffic Management Flight (TMF)/Commercial Travel Office (CTO) may no longer autho-
rize/approve first or business class travel accommodations when regularly scheduled flights between the
authorized origin and destination (including connection points) provide only first class or business class
accommodations. These flights must now be authorized/approved by the appropriate business or first
class travel authorizing/approving authority.
2.7.2.4. First class travel accommodations. The SecAF has designated SAF/OS and SAF/US as the
approval authorities for all first class travel accommodation requests, except as noted below. First class
travel requests for civilian personnel will be submitted to SAF/AA for review and routing to SAF/OS or
SAF/US as appropriate for consideration. First class travel requests for military personnel will be routed
to AF/ILGD for review and forwarding to AF/CV. AF/CV will review and determine whether or not mil-
itary requests should be forwarded to SAF/AA for approval consideration. SAF/AA will review and route
to SAF/OS or SAF/US as appropriate for consideration. Note the approval authority exception at para-
graph 2.7.2.9. below.
2.7.2.5. Business class travel accommodations. The SecAF has designated the following as business class
travel authorization/approval and reporting officials. Note the approval authority exception at paragraph
2.7.2.9. below.
2.7.2.6. Air Staff and Air Force Secretariat civilian personnel forward all business class travel accommo-
dation requests to SAF/AA. Air Staff and Air Force Secretariat military personnel will route all business
class travel accommodation requests to AF/ILGD, for review and forwarding to AF/CV. AF/CV will
review and determine whether or not military requests should be forwarded to SAF/AA for consideration.
SAF/AA is the business class approval authority for three-star generals and below and civilian equiva-
lents assigned to the Air Staff and the Air Force Secretariat. SAF/AA will review and forward business
class travel requests for four-star general and civilian equivalents assigned within the Air Staff and the Air
Force Secretariat to SAF/OS or SAF/US as appropriate for consideration. Note the approval authority
exception at paragraph 2.7.2.9. below.

2.7.2.7. The MAJCOM Commander (MAJCOM CV in the absence of the CC) is the authorization/
approval authority for business class travel for requests from personnel assigned to the MAJCOM. Note:
Includes personnel assigned to a Numbered Air Force when traveling on Air Force business. When trav-
eling on Joint business, requests for business-class approval are submitted in accordance with the Joint
Staff approval procedures.
2.7.2.8. The AF/CV, or AF/CVA in the absence of the CV, is the authorization/approval authority for busi-
ness class travel for requests from personnel assigned to Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) and Field Oper-
ating Agencies (FOAs). Requests for business class travel accommodation will be routed to AF/ILGD for
review and forwarded to AF/CV for consideration.
2.7.2.9. In accordance with the JTR, paragraphs C2204-B3d (first class) and B4d (business class), and
JFTR, paragraphs U3125-B3d (first class) and B4d (business class) the category "When required by mis-
sion" can only be applied in connection with Presidential, Congressional or Secretarial designated boards,
commissions, task forces, and special high level invited guests (approval level is Executive Secretary,
Office of the Secretary of Defense) and for the Armed Forces Entertainment (AFE) Program, (approval
level is the Executive Agent for the AFE program, currently the Department of the Air Force).
2.7.3. Premium Class Travel (PCT) Approval Process. Every effort should be made to obtain approval
prior to traveling. However, in cases where extenuating or emergency circumstances make advanced
authorization impossible, the traveler must still obtain "after-the-fact" written authorization at the earliest
possible time. In the event an after-the-fact request is disapproved, the traveler is liable for the difference
in cost between the premium class and coach class air accommodations.
2.7.3.1. The designated authorization/approval officials may authorize/approve first class accommoda-
tions when at least one of the conditions in the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B3 or the JTR, paragraph
C2204-B3 is met, and may approve business class accommodations provided at least one of the condi-
tions in the JFTR, paragraph U3125-B4 or JTR, paragraph C2204-B4 is met.
2.7.3.2. To assist in the authorization/approval official in determining whether the PCT request meets the
JTR/JFTR criteria, a PCT Decision Support Tool has been developed for use by the traveler, travel autho-
rizing official (AO), and the premium class authorizing/approval official. The PCT Decision Support Tool
is available at the AF/ILGD web site, under Premium Class Travel Issues.
2.7.3.3. The traveler submits the PCT request through the traveler’s order authorizing official (AO) to the
appropriate PCT authorization/approval authority designated above. Requests for PCT accommodation
that must be approved at the AF/CV, SAF/AA, SAF/US or SAF/OS levels should be submitted as soon as
the requirement is anticipated, but not less than 15 duty days prior to the desired travel date. Note: MAJ-
COMs, DRUs, and FOAs may want to establish PCT internal routing procedures for their organizations.
2.7.3.4. A sample request for approval of PCT accommodation due to a Disability, or Other Physical
Impairment and a request for Other than a Disability, or Other Physical Impairment are available at the
AF/ILGD web site, under Premium Class Travel Issues. Justification for the PCT category requests must
state why PCT is necessary for mission accomplishment and not just identify the category as indicated in
the JTR or JFTR. Much of the information indicated on the sample PCT request is used for the PCT
reporting requirement.
2.7.3.5. The designated PCT authorization/approval authority reviews the request to ensure sufficient jus-
tification is provided to show mission necessity and justify the expenditure of additional Government
funds required for the PCT. After the decision is made to approve or disapprove the PCT request, the PCT
authorization/approval authority forwards the decision to the travel authorizing official (AO). If the PCT
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     87


request is approved, the PCT approval authority must retain a file copy of the approved package for a
period of 6 years and 3 months for audit purposes.
2.7.3.6. When the travel AO receives the PCT authorization/approval authority’s decision, the AO notifies
the traveler of the decision. If approved, the AO ensures that the appropriate documentation (see below
for appropriate words) is entered on the travel order/authorization so the CTO can issue PCT tickets.
2.7.4. PCT Documentation Requirements.
2.7.4.1. Before the CTO can issue PCT tickets, a statement must be entered in the remarks section of the
travel order/authorization indicating that PCT has been approved. The minimum information that must be
entered on the travel order/authorization is:
2.7.4.1.1. The type of PCT accommodations approved. (Business or First Class.)
2.7.4.1.2. The regulatory reference in the JTR/JFTR that was used to justify the PCT.
2.7.4.1.3. The cost difference between the premium class and coach class fares (normal Government rout-
ing, YCA and other Government contract fares, etc., available).
2.7.4.1.4. The premium class approving authority, Name, Rank, and Office Symbol.


An example of required statement:


Example: Business class travel has been justified and approved based on JFTR, U3125-B4a, space is not
available in coach class. The cost difference between the business class fare and the coach class fare is
$765.00. This PCT was approved by General, David Smith, HQ USAF/XXXX. Full documentation of the
PCT approval is on file in the office of the PCT approving official.


2.7.4.2. For those situations, as identified in the JTR, paragraph C2000-A2a and JFTR, paragraph
U2000-A2a, where "extenuating circumstances or emergency situations" prevent advance authorization/
approval of premium class travel, a statement will be placed on that travel order/authorization to permit
CTO ticketing. The statement must indicate the extenuating circumstance or emergency precluding PCT
authorization/approval prior to the start of travel and that authorization/approval is being or will be pur-
sued after-the-fact. Issuance of PCT tickets by the CTO is permitted in anticipation of approval. If the
authorizing/approval authority does not approve the after-the-fact PCT request, the traveler is responsible
for the cost difference between the PCT transportation used and the transportation class for which the
traveler was eligible. The statement must include the cost difference between the coach class and the pre-
mium class being requested and the name, rank and office symbol of the AO. The JFTR/JTR requires that
after-the-fact PCT approval be completed within seven days of travel completion. It will be the responsi-
bility of the traveler and AO to ensure that the PCT approval is obtained or that the traveler pays the dif-
ference between the travel class authorized and the travel class used.


An example of required statement:
88                                                        AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


Example: After-the fact approval for business class travel is being pursued. This is a short notice travel
requirement and sufficient time is not available to obtain authorization/approval prior to travel com-
mencement. Business class travel is being justified in accordance with JFTR, paragraph U3125-B4a;
space is not available in coach class. The cost difference between the business class fare and the coach
class fare is $765.00. If the request for business class travel is not approved, the traveler is responsible for
the cost difference between the business class fare and the coach class fare. The travel order/authorization,
authorizing official is Lt Col, Robert Jones, 355th XXX. The CTO is authorized to provide business class
tickets for this travel.


2.7.5. Premium Class Travel Reporting Requirement. All PCT must be reported to the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness). The first report covered the period of 1 Apr 04 through
30 Jun 04; the second report covered the period of 1 Jul 04 through 30 Sep 04. Future reports are required
to be submitted semiannually, 1 Oct through 31 Mar, and 1 Apr through 30 Sep, with reports due to OUSD
(P&R) 30 days after the end of reporting period. The office of the approving official must enter on the
spreadsheet (copy available at the ILGD web site, under Premium Class Travel Issues) the data required
for reporting up channel. Also, available at the web site is a copy of the Premium Class Travel Report
Data Elements Instructions. The reports (spreadsheets) should be completed and forwarded as an email
attachment to "mailto:AFILGD.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil", not later than 20 days after the end of
each reporting period. AF/ILGD is responsible for consolidating and forwarding the Air Force report to
OUSD (P&R).

                       Note: 1 & 2.                         Notes: 1, 3, & 6.


Note 1. Premium class travel authorizing/approving officials may not approve their own premium class
travel accommodations. Authorization/approval must be obtained from a senior flag officer or civilian
equivalent. Example: A four-star MAJCOM commander has business class approval authority for those
within the MAJCOM on an exception basis and when the travel request meets the established criteria in
AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                     91


the JFTR/JTR. However, MAJCOM commanders must submit their own business class travel requests to
AF/CC or AF/CV, as appropriate.


Note 2. Civilian requests for first class travel will be submitted to SAF/AA. SAF/AA will review requests
prior to forwarding to SAF/US or SAF/OS as appropriate. Military member requests for first class travel
will be submitted to AF/ILGD. AF/ILGD will review requests and forward to AF/CV for review and for-
ward to SAF/AA who will review and forward to SAF/US or SAF/OS for approval consideration.


Note 3. The authorization/approval authority for business class travel may be delegated no lower than to
a two-star general officer or civilian equivalent level, and the approving official must be senior in the
reporting chain to the requester. Therefore, if the indicated approval authority is not a two-star general
officer or civilian equivalent or higher and senior in the chain of command, the request must be forwarded
up the chain of command for appropriate approval.


Note 4. Civilians assigned to the Air Staff and Secretariat will submit business class requests to SAF/AA.
Military member requests for business class travel will be submitted to AF/ILGD. AF/ILGD will review
requests and forward to AF/CV for review and forwarding to SAF/AA who will in turn review and as
appropriate forward to SAF/US or SAF/OS for approval consideration. SAF/AA is the business class
approval authority for three-star generals and below, and civilian equivalents assigned to the Air Staff and
Secretariat. SAF/OS and SAF/US are the business class approval authorities for four-star generals and
civilian equivalents assigned to the Air Staff and Secretariat.


Note 5. For personnel traveling on Air Force business, MAJCOM/CCs, and MAJCOM/CVs in the
absence of the MAJCOM/CC, have business class approval authority for personnel under their command,
including personnel assigned to numbered air forces. When personnel travel on Joint business, requests
for business class travel approval are submitted in accordance with Joint staff or command approval pro-
cedures.


Note 6. The Air National Guard Director (NGB/CF) has business class approval authority for personnel
assigned to the ANG. In the absence of the NGB/CF, requests for business class travel will be forwarded
through AF/ILGD to AF/CV for business class travel approval consideration.




2.9. Family Member/Spouse Travel to Award Ceremonies.
2.9.1. MAJCOM commanders and vice commanders may approve spouse travel for spouses of award
recipients to attend a major award ceremony (i.e., Presidential award ceremony, or an annual agency or
major organizational component ceremony, or a prestigious honorary award ceremony sponsored by a
non-Federal organization). When family member/spouse travel to attend an award ceremony is approved,
an Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) will be issued. Only transportation costs will be funded; per
diem will not be paid.
92                                                       AFI24-101_AFRCSUP1_I 26 JANUARY 2005


2.9.1.1. If there is no spouse or the spouse is unable to attend, the recipient may elect to invite one family
member to attend the ceremony. When family member travel to attend an award ceremony is approved, an
ITA will be issued. Only transportation costs will be funded; per diem will not be paid. See JTR, Appen-
dix E, Part I for further guidance.
2.9.1.2. When the family member/spouse is an Air Force uniformed service member or Air Force Civil
Service employee and family member/spouse travel is approved, a TDY order will be issued rather than
an ITA.
2.9.1.3. When an individual who is neither an Air Force member nor an Air Force Civil Service employee
is selected as an award recipient, the recipient and family member/spouse may travel on an ITA to attend
the presentation ceremony. See JFTR/JTR, Appendix E, for guidance and limitations on travel reimburse-
ments.


NOTE: Family members and spouses traveling to an award ceremony are not required to meet the partic-
ipation requirements stipulated in this AFI, Paragraph 2.8.


Attachment 6


CENTRALLY BILLED ACCOUNT (CBA) PROCEDURES


A6.1. The CBA is used as the method of payment for airline, rail and sometimes bus tickets when:
A6.1.1. A traveler has not been issued an Individually Billed Account (IBA), commonly referred to as a
personal Government Travel Card (GTC).
A6.1.2. Traveling as a group.
A6.1.3. Directed by the MAJCOM Commander/Base Commander.
A6.2. To preclude travelers from mistakenly requesting reimbursement when the CBA method of pay-
ment is used, the CTO will mark the traveler’s itinerary or ticket(s) with the method of payment. Tickets
purchased using a CBA will state, “Airline ticket(s) paid by CBA, Non-Reimbursable to Traveler.” Tick-
ets purchased using an IBA will state, “Airline Ticket(s) paid by IBA, Reimbursable to Traveler”. Note:
The Passenger Name Record (PNR) invoice should not contain the CBA or IBA number.
A6.3. Except for travel arrangements made through the Defense Travel System (DTS), the Traffic Man-
agement Flight (TMF) must maintain a copy of the PNR invoice and a copy of the travel authorization/
order for each ticket issued on the CBA. These documents should be filed either by transaction date, ticket
number or alphabetically (traveler’s name) to facilitate reconciling the CBA invoice. If the travel authori-
zation/order is processed through the DTS, there is no need to retain a copy of the PNR and travel autho-
rization because they are stored electronically within the DTS. However, optional retention of a copy of
the PNR and travel authorization for DTS transactions, appropriately filed, may simplify the reconcilia-
tion process.
A6.4. When un-used or partially used tickets are returned to the CTO/TMF, documentation is initiated and
forwarded to the airline/rail company for the appropriate refund/credit. The TMF must establish an active

suspense file identifying all travel transactions due credits/refunds from the airlines/rail companies for
tickets charged to the CBA. Tracking must be accomplished by maintaining paper copy documentation
files and by spreadsheet or another quick reference product that provides current status of all credits/
refunds due. As a minimum the tracking product requires the travel order/authorization number, traveler’s
name, date a refund request was submitted, amount of credit due, and the date refund/credit was received
as identified on the Government Travel Card Vendor (GTCV) invoice report. The TMF must ensure that
credits due appear on the GTCV’s invoice report until the credit is received. A follow-up process, at least
monthly, should be established to check status of outstanding credits due.
A6.5. CBA Reconciliation Process
A6.5.1. The GTCV forwards the paper copy of the invoice at the end of the billing cycle to the TMF. The
paper copy GTCV invoice (bill) should be received approximately seven to ten days after the end of the
billing cycle. When received, the invoice is date stamped. This date starts the clock for prompt payment.
The payment due date is stated on the GTCV invoice (and is the date used for determining amounts past
due and the account suspension date). The reconciliation should be completed and certified by the TMF
within 10 days after receipt. Note: If the paper copy invoice is not received within 10 days after the end of
the billing cycle, the TMF should contact and advise the GTCV that the invoice was not received.
A6.5.2. At the end of the billing cycle the GTCV sends an electronic version of the CBA invoice to the
CTO. The electronic version should contain the same data as the paper copy invoice sent to the TMF. The
electronic invoice should be used to start the reconciliation rather than waiting for the paper copy.
A6.5.3. The TMF may also monitor CBA transactions using the GTCV EAGLS web based program.
A6.5.4. Based on the CTO contract, the CTO’s participation in the reconciliation process varies. The TMF
establishes written local procedures on the CBA reconciliation process to include specific CTO and TMF
responsibilities and time periods for accomplishment.
A6.5.5. The CBA reconciliation process as a minimum must include the following:
A6.5.5.1. Review of all charges and credits on the electronic version of the invoice to include: amount,
date, passenger name, ticket number, and airline code. The CTO may make minor corrections (but not
dollar amounts) and forward the updated disk and reports to the Transportation Officer (TO).
A6.5.5.2. The CTO/TMF pulls the previously filed copies of refunds identified as credits on the invoice
for use in the reconciliation process.
A6.5.5.3. The TMF/CTO assembles a copy of each travel authorization/order and a copy of each PNR
invoice in the same sequence as appears on the GTCV hard copy invoice.
A6.5.5.4. The TMF is responsible for reconciling the report for payment, making sure the ticket number,
traveler’s name, airline code and cost on the PNR invoice match the hard copy of the GTCV’s invoice.
 A6.5.5.5. The CTO/TMF work the unmatched transactions indicating "awaiting credit or wrongful
charges" to the account. If there are missing credits/refunds or wrongful charges, the ticket number is
researched for the traveler's name and date the ticket was issued. Ensure the appropriate GTCV dispute
form is completed. The TMO must suspense the dispute until it is resolved with all parties concerned.
Once resolved, the TMO must monitor the next invoice to ensure all disputes have been updated.
A6.5.5.6. All transactions on the GTCV PAPER COPY invoice must be certified for payment or placed in
dispute. TMOs should reconcile and pay everything on that specific invoice so the charges on the invoice
and the Standard Form 1113 or Standard Form 1034 match completely. The only time the price for that

billing cycle should be different is when the TMO disputes a charge and/or credit. When the credit shows
up on the next months invoice, the TMO can then process the credit, refund or void the ticket. The TO
must verify the amount being certified for payment and type the certification statement on the Standard
Form 1113 or Standard Form 1034, sign and date the form.
A6.5.5.7. The TMF/CTO must make the number of copies of the travel authorizations/orders and PNR
invoices required by the supporting DFAS/OPLOC. The travel authorizations/orders and PNRs must be
assembled in the proper sequence and forwarded to the DFAS/OPLOC with a paper copy of the GTCV’s
invoice, a copy of the TO’s certified Standard Form 1113 or Standard Form 1034 and a disk (provided by
the CTO) with all of the reconciled transactions in the TTOPRS format. Note: CBA transactions pro-
cessed through DTS do not require copies of the travel authorizations/orders and PNRs to be forwarded to
DFAS/OPLOC, as they can be reviewed through the web. The TMF should retain a backup copy of the
assembled documentation in case the documentation is lost in transit between the DFAS/OPLOC and the
shipping location.
A6.6. DFAS/OPLOC should process each invoice within 10 days of receipt and make EFT payment to the
bank. This effort ensures CBA payments are received by the bank in a timely manner preventing late pay-
ment interest penalties, and precluding account suspensions.
