1.7. Installation Commander. The installation commander is responsible for the fire safety of
personnel and property under their control, provided for by the FES programs contained in this
instruction. This responsibility is discharged through the Fire Marshal and executed by the Fire
Chief. The installation commander reviews and approves Operational Risk Management (ORM)
plans that address facility fire safety and reductions in FES capability. The Fire Marshal and Fire
Chief provide periodic updates to keep the commander aware of FES capability and risk.
   1.7.1. Installation commanders responsible for small installations such as radar sites,
   auxiliary fields with few facilities or infrequent aircraft operations will need to determine,
   with MAJCOM A7 concurrence, if a FES flight is warranted for their mission. The
   installation commander, with advice from the Command Fire Chief, develops an ORM plan
   to determine alternatives to an on-site fire department. Key considerations are preventing
   fires, workplace fire safety education, capability to provide early intervention at fires, and

     managing fires that have progressed beyond the incipient stages. When the installation
     commander concludes that an on-site fire department is not justified, they appoint a Fire
     Safety Manager and send the ORM to the MAJCOM A7 for approval by the MAJCOM CC.
     1.7.2. The Fire Safety Manager (reference paragraph 1.7.1), manages FES programs at
     installations without an on-site fire department. These individuals are responsible to oversee
     the execution of the ORM plan approved in 1.7.1.
1.8. Fire Marshal. The Civil Engineer (CE) Squadron or CE Group Commander or the Base
Civil Engineer (BCE) is the Fire Marshal. The Fire Marshal is responsible to the Installation
Commander for oversight of FES programs and provides the Fire Chief the resources available to
execute the FES mission. Fire Marshals shall attend the Fire Marshal Course at the Louis F.
Garland Fire Academy within six months of assuming Fire Marshal duties.
     1.8.1. The CE Programs Flight Chief is responsible to the Fire Marshal to ensure all
     construction projects are designed with all required fire safety features. The CE Operations
     Flight Chief (or contractor operations service) is responsible to the Fire Marshal for
     inspection, testing, maintenance and documentation associated with all fire detection,
     notification, suppression and water distribution systems.
1.9. Fire Chief. The Installation Fire Chief is the FES Flight Chief and is directly responsible to
the Fire Marshal for establishing, executing and maintaining FES programs; determining the
resources required; conducting risk assessments; advising commanders regarding risk and
capability, and implementing risk management actions. Fire Chiefs develop ORM plans that
address reduced FES capability.
     1.9.1. Fire Chiefs develop a variety of standard operating instructions, guides, plans and
     procedures according to local, AF, and statutory requirements. A summary of these
     requirements are listed in the Fire Emergency Services Assessment Program (FESAP). The
     FESAP is a dynamic document maintained by AFCESA/CEXF and available at the AF FES
     CoP.
     1.9.2. The Fire Chief will develop an Organizational Statement identifying the scope of
     services provided based upon the unique mission requirements of the installation.

                                MISSION AND STANDARDS

2.1. Mission. The mission of a Fire Emergency Services (FES) flight is to provide fire
prevention and protection, fire fighting, rescue, and Hazardous Materials (HazMat) response
capabilities to prevent or minimize injury, loss of life, and damage to property and the
environment.
2.2. Goal. The goal of FES flights is to protect AF personnel, property and missions from all
hazards. Resources are authorized to deliver required capabilities to manage the core missions of
the flight.
2.3. Organization. FES flights are organized as a part of civil engineer squadrons (CES) within
a civil engineer or mission support group.
2.4. Objectives. Fire prevention is a primary objective of the flight. This objective is achieved
with an aggressive and effective fire prevention program consisting of fire safety education,
inspections, enforcement and facility design review. A secondary objective is early intervention
at emergency events by occupants, operators, and automatic fire protection systems. Finally, the
third objective is to intervene early with firefighters when FES events occur. This multi-phased
approach ensures mitigating actions are initiated as soon as possible to minimize consequences
of the incident.
   2.4.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Authentic Standards: Fire-prevention and protection
   standards developed by recognized professional organizations apply to conditions not

affecting FES operations are adopted either as written or as implemented with specific Technical
Implementation Guides (TIG).
   2.6.1. AF FES policy and guidance will be implemented through TIGs approved by The AF
   Fire Chief. The TIGs reflect AF mission and priorities and ensure implementation of NFPA
   standards are consistent with Air Force policy and guidance.
   2.6.2. The Air Force Fire Chief shall establish working groups consisting of members
   nominated by the Command Fire Chiefs and representatives from labor and other functional
   areas when appropriate to assist in the development of TIGs. The Air Force Civil Engineer
   approves the implementation of all TIGs when deviations to policy exist. TIGs will be
   coordinated with all MAJCOM Civil Engineers prior to implementation.
   2.6.3. Fire protection requirements for facilities are contained in Unified Facilities Criteria
   (UFC) 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities and Engineering Technical
   Letters (ETL). NFPA standards (excluding facility design, engineering, and life safety
   requirements) will not be implemented for one year after publication to allow time for
   analysis and development of a TIG. One year after publication, the standard is effective
   unless otherwise directed by The Air Force Fire Chief. TIGs will be numbered according to
   the NFPA standard they implement and the edition of the standard. For example, NFPA TIG
   1710-01 implements NFPA Std. 1710, 2001 edition. TIGs remain in effect until superseded,

   withdrawn, or one year following a new edition of the NFPA standard. NFPA TIGs are
   available on the AF FES CoP web site.
   2.6.4. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreements
   (STANAGs). Units assigned to and that execute NATO missions implement NATO
   STANAGs as ratified by the United States. Ratification and applicability of NATO
   STANAGs are located at http://nsa.nato.int/.
2.7. Staffing. DoDI 6055.06, DoD Fire and Emergency Services Program, requires DoD
components to determine their scope of service (see paragraph 2.5), level of service objectives
and document staffing levels required to meet those objectives, assuming ―one major incident‖ at
a time. A major incident is one that requires the full on-duty staffing of the fire department.
Multiple minor events may occur but major events are rare.
   2.7.1. Each flight receives primary resources (manpower and vehicles) to manage the flight,
   prevent fires (fire prevention section), manage training (training section), and provide
   emergency response and incident management capability (operations section). The operations
   section is calculated on a 72-hour work week. All other positions are earned based on a 40-
   hour workweek but may work up to 60-hours to support operations when approved by the
   commander.
   2.7.2. Adjusted Manpower for Operations (AMO) is the total number of operations
   personnel needed to accomplish all fire ground tasks without multi-tasking. AMO is
   determined by dividing the total authorizations for operations by the manpower availability
   factor 2.64. The result is the number of personnel expected for duty when all authorized
   personnel are available. The AMO is based on typical structural and aircraft firefighting tasks
   (see paragraph A.4.3.).
2.8. Levels of Service. The Air Force has determined that each FES flight will provide a level
of service (LOS) commensurate with the risk. The LOS are expressed as the Optimum Level of
Service (OLS), Reduced Level of Service (RLS) and Critical Level of Service (CLS).
Manpower and vehicle authorizations are based on the OLS. Attachment 3 provides objectives
for FES operations and personnel and vehicle levels of service.
   2.8.1. It is assumed that only one major FES event will occur at a time at an installation.
   Based on historic emergency response data, the most probable major fire emergency event is
   a fire at one location inside or outside an aircraft, or a fire in a structure that has not
   progressed beyond the room/area of origin.
   2.8.2. Fire Chiefs must carefully consider the objectives of fire fighting operations as they
   allocate resources. These objectives depend on the type of fire attack, offensive (small
   contained fire) or defensive (fire is too large/dangerous for direct attack). For offensive fire
   attack, the objective is to quickly extinguish the fire and rescue any victims. For defensive
   fire attack, the objective is to protect exposures to the fire, account for exposed personnel and
   rescue if possible. These objectives do not change but the point at which an offensive attack
   changes to defensive attack can change according to available resources.
   2.8.3. The OLS is available when 90 to 100 percent of the AMO and 90 percent of required
   agent are available. During OLS, fire fighting forces can expect successful outcomes when a
   structural fire is confined to the room/area of origin, offensive fire attack operations can be
   initiated prior to flashover and required fire fighting vehicles are available. For aircraft fires,
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                         17


  fire fighting forces can expect success when the fire is limited to a single aircraft and all fire
  fighting agent is available.
  2.8.4. The RLS is when available resources are less than the OLS requirements but greater
  than CLS. This varying level of service allows adequate fire ground capability based on
  historic emergency response data and the most probable major fire emergency event. This
  level of service would be expected and acceptable when resources are not available due to
  various circumstances such as AEF deployments, sick leaves, etc. During this level of
  service, adequate firefighting capability can be provided by utilizing cross staffing, selective
  response and sound fire ground tactics. During RLS, fire fighting forces can expect
  successful outcomes when a structural fire is confined to the room/area of origin, offensive
  fire attack operations can be initiated prior to flashover and required fire fighting vehicles are
  available. For aircraft fires, fire fighting forces can expect success when all fire fighting
  agent is available and the fire is limited to one location. However, initially responding
  firefighters may not be able to sustain emergency operations without supplemental resources.
     2.8.4.1. During RLS, the Fire Chief allocates resources according to local risk factors
     with the goal to provide the highest level of service during higher risk periods. At the top
     of this level of service objectives can be achieved at most fire ground operations. As the
     level of capability decreases, increased cross-manned and multi-tasked by firefighters on
     the scene will be necessary to accomplish critical fire ground tasks. As the capability
     further decreases, the level of service will be reduced and the safety of firefighters on the
     scene must be considered. Example 1: Top End of RLS: 1st Run Engine w/4 FF on scene
     within 7 min, 2nd Run Engine w/4 FF, Rescue w/3 FF, and Chief 2 on scene w/in 12 min.
     Total of 12 firefighters on scene within required response times. Example 2: As manning
     decreases, 1st Run w/4 FF w/in 7 min, 2nd Run w/4 FF and Chief 2 w/in 12 min. Total of
     9 firefighters on scene within required response times. These examples meet the Air
     Force Level of Service policy.
  2.8.5. The CLS is the absolute minimum level of service and is only permitted for short
  durations. During this level of service at least one appropriate firefighting vehicle and a
  minimum of 7 firefighters must be available to respond to each FDZ within the emergency
  response time standard. At the CLS, fire fighting forces can expect successful outcomes
  when a structural fire is confined to the room/area of origin, offensive fire attack operations
  can be initiated prior to flashover and at least one pumper vehicle is available. For aircraft
  fires, fire fighting forces can provide initial fire suppression operations when at least one
  ARFF vehicle is available, the fire is limited to one location and the fire does not involve the
  aircraft’s fuel system. Firefighting crews may provide limited search and rescue, and
  property conservation during this period; however, these capabilities cannot be sustained
  without additional resources. Example: 1st Run w/ 4 FF on scene w/in 7 minutes, Rescue w/2
  FF and Chief 2 on scene w/in 12. Total of 7 firefighters on scene within required response
  times. These examples meet the Air Force Level of Service policy.
     2.8.5.1. Deviating below CLS, is not permitted. Below CLS, interior operations must be
     suspended except to perform rescue when at least 4 firefighters are available. Interior fire
     attack is not permitted unless a dedicated rapid intervention team is available. If resources
     are not available to sustain CLS, the Fire Chief prepares an ORM plan as described in
     paragraph 2.10 of this instruction.
 18                                     AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012


   2.8.6. To ensure crew integrity and prevent negatively impacting response times due to
   disruptions in emergency response posture, military firefighters shall be authorized Basic
   Allowance for Subsistence (BAS).
2.9. Standards of Response Coverage (SORC). The Fire Chief will establish a Standard of
Response Coverage which is defined as ―written policies and procedures that establish the
distribution and concentration of fixed and mobile resources of an organization.‖ SORC is a
system that includes an analysis of risks and expectations to assist in making decisions on
deployment issues.
   2.9.1. Fire Response Districts (FRD). FRD defines the area of responsibility for first-
   response apparatus. Fire response districts are developed to ensure arrival of appropriate
   levels of staffing and equipment in accordance with required response times found in DoDI
   6055.06
       2.9.1.1. Response time standards ensure firefighters intervene as soon as practical at the
       beginning of an event to minimize damage and avoid a major FES event. Locate fire
       stations and assign vehicles and staffing to comply with the response standards in
       Attachment 3 (taken from DoDI 6055.06 (21 Dec 06).
   2.9.2. Fire Demand Zones (FDZ). Within each FRD, fire demand zones are established
   based on pre-planning and historical response data to identify specific requirements/demands
   for FES incidents. FDZ are influenced by geography, special hazards, type of construction,
   and occupancy. All facilities should be identified within a FDZ with required resources
   capable of meeting response times to the facilities 90% of the time. Resources from multiple
   FRDs can be utilized to meet the FDZ requirements.
2.10. Master Planning. Fire Chiefs will develop a master plan that coordinates the vision,
mission, values, and goals of the FES flight. The master plan utilizes a service-area-wide
balanced and cost effective hazard management strategy that takes into consideration existing
conditions and anticipates overall community growth.
2.11. Deviations from FES Policy. FES policy is derived from DoDI 6055.06, AFPD 32-20,
OSHA regulations and NFPA standards, as implemented by this instruction. Deviating from AF
policy may impact the level of service of the FES flight and increase risk to AF personnel and
property. The Fire Chief, as the installation commander’s FES risk advisor, assesses the risk
resulting from all deviations from AF policy.
   2.11.1. Short-Term Deviations. Short-term deviations are caused by immediate unavoidable
   circumstances that reduce capability or situations that cause a deviation from other FES
   policy for less than 90 days continuously. Short- term deviations are normally resolved at the
   Fire Chief level. The Fire Chief will establish risk management plans, response plans and
   standard operating procedures to deal with reductions in manpower and vehicle resources.
   Reductions in levels of service are reported as instructed in paragraph 6.5. If the Fire Chief
   determines the need for an ORM plan it will be approved by the BCE and reviewed by the
   installation commander.
   2.11.2. Temporary Deviations. Temporary deviations are situations that reduce capability or
   situations that cause a deviation from other FES policy for more than 90 days but less than
   one year. The Fire Chief prepares an ORM plan that includes a get-well date within one year
   of ORM approval date. Temporary deviations and ORM must be approved by the installation
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                   19


  commander and reviewed by the MAJCOM/CV. Approved deviations are valid for up to one
  year from the date of approval. The fire chief will forward a copy of the approved temporary
  waiver to the command FES office within 7 days of approval.
  2.11.3. Long-Term Deviations. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) has delegated
  Long-Term Deviation authority to the Air Force Civil Engineer. When deviations from this
  instruction are not expected to be remedied, the installation commander will seek a Long-
  Term Deviation from the Air Force Civil Engineer through the MAJCOM/A7. A review of
  all Long-Term Deviations must be conducted every three years to determine validity.
  AFCESA will brief new AF Civil Engineers on all existing Long-Term Deviations.
  2.11.4. Reporting Deviations. Command Fire Chiefs provide a copy of all approved
  temporary and long-term deviations to AFCESA/CEXF no later than 31 Oct of each
  year. The Air Force Fire Chief will provide copies of all temporary and long-term deviations
  from DoDI 6055.06 to the DUSD(I&E).

                                           Chapter 3

                         FES ORGANIZATION AND PROGRAMS

3.1. Flight Organization. FES organizational structure is broadly categorized as Management
and Administration, Fire Prevention, Training, and Operations. The FES management staff
provides administration, communication, oversight and supervision for the flight. It consists of
the Fire Chief, Deputy Fire Chief, Operations Assistant Chief (one per shift), Training Assistant
Chief and Fire Prevention Assistant Chief. The administrative staff consists of fire inspectors,
emergency center dispatchers and an administrative assistant.
   3.1.1. Except for the administrative assistant/secretary and dispatchers, all positions are GS-
   081, Pay Bands YL/N, and Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 3E7XX. Dispatchers are GS-
   2151. Dispatchers will be civilian except at locations where Air Force civilian positions are
   not authorized. When necessary, military 3E7XX personnel may be assigned dispatcher
   duties on a rotational basis, however; Fire Chiefs will ensure the tour length is minimal and
   does not impact operational proficiency training needs.
   3.1.2. To maximize personnel availability, work schedules for all FES personnel (military
   and civilian) may include a 24-hour shift. Fire chiefs should consider using administrative
   personnel to mitigate personnel shortages in FES operations.
   3.1.3. Fire Marshals will ensure FES personnel are not assigned additional duties outside the
   FES flight that reduce personnel availability and capability to safely perform FES operations
   when called.
3.2. Management. The Fire Chief establishes and maintains FES programs to ensure the
protection of Air Force personnel and property, while ensuring firefighter safety.
   3.2.1. FES Assessment Program (FESAP) is based on national consensus standards, OSHA
   regulations, and DoD and AF specific guidance and policy. The assessment provides
   benchmarks to promote efficiency, sound management practices and to verify compliance
   with regulatory requirements. Command Inspector General (IG) teams will adopt the AF
   FESAP as the standard inspection checklist. Command Fire Chiefs will develop
   supplemental information to address unique mission requirements. Fire Chiefs will use this
   program to satisfy the self-inspection requirements specified in AFI 90-201, Inspector
   General Activities.
   3.2.2. Firefighter Fitness and Wellness Program is applicable for all AF firefighters whose
   position descriptions require participation in emergency incident operations. In addition to
   Air Force fitness requirements applicable to Airmen, all firefighters shall participate in a
   fitness and wellness program consistent with NFPA Std. 1500, Occupational Safety and
   Health Program as established by the Fire Chief. Individuals not physically capable of
   performing essential job functions will be referred to the appropriate medical authority for a
   fitness-for-duty evaluation in accordance with 5 CFR, Part 339, Medical Qualification
   Determination.
   3.2.3. Occupational Safety and Health Program is should comply with NFPA Std. 1500, for
   FES flights. The Fire Chief will complete ORM plans addressing non-compliance with
   NFPA Std. 1500.
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                         21


   3.2.4. Wildland Fire Management Program (WFMP). In accordance with AFI 32-7064,
   Integrated Natural Resources Management, the Fire Chief will determine the number and
   types of certifications required for the expected level of involvement prescribed in the
   WFMP. When firefighters are required to combat wildland fire fighting beyond the incipient
   stages, training will be provided to meet NFPA Std. 1051, Wildland Firefighter Professional
   Qualifications, certification standards and may also be required to meet additional National
   Wildland Coordinating Group (NWCG) Wildland Fire Qualification Subsystem Guide (PMS
   310-1/NFES 1414) qualifications. The WFMP may assist in determining required
   suppression resources to respond to installation wildfire hazards.
3.3. FES Fire Prevention. The objectives of the Fire Prevention Program are to prevent fires,
facilitate early intervention at fires that occur, and ensure the safety of exposed personnel during
fires. These objectives are accomplished through four program elements: FES facility plan
reviews, fire prevention inspections, code enforcement and fire safety education.
   3.3.1. Execution of the Fire Prevention program is a priority for the flight. The fire
   prevention program shall be properly staffed IAW DoDI 6055.06, with DoD certified fire
   inspectors. It is recommended AF fire inspectors attend the DoDFA Fire Inspectors course.
   3.3.2. Civil Engineer Programs (CEP) flight personnel manage fire protection engineering
   requirements as prescribed by the current edition of Unified Facility Criteria (UFC) 3-600-
   01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities. The CEP flight shall perform design reviews
   to ensure inclusion of UFC 3-600-01, Engineer Technical Letters (ETL), NFPA codes and
   applicable host nation standards.
       3.3.2.1. Projects involving design or modification of fire rated construction, fire
       detection, fire suppression, or life safety systems require the services and review of a
       qualified fire protection engineer meeting the requirements of UFC 3-600-01. The fire
       protection engineer is an integral part of the design team, and must be involved in every
       aspect of the design as it relates to fire protection.
       3.3.2.2. Fire inspectors should not conduct technical design reviews (hydraulic
       calculations, occupant load/exit calculations, etc.), but shall review plans to ensure all
       required features are present and local emergency response elements are incorporated
       (i.e., accessibility to facility, location of fire hydrants, etc.).
       3.3.2.3. The Fire Chief will provide design review comments to the CEP Flight Chief for
       incorporation in projects. This is normally achieved utilizing the fire prevention section.
   3.3.3. Fire prevention inspections are conducted at least annually for all facilities. Family
   housing is excluded except for common areas in multi-family housing units and privatized
   housing when directed by local agreements. Common areas include laundry rooms, game
   rooms, stairwells, hallways, elevators, etc. The Fire Chief may institute more frequent
   inspections to include unannounced and after hours inspections.
       3.3.3.1. Objectives of fire prevention inspections include identifying and correcting fire
       safety hazards (conditions that can cause a fire) and Fire Safety Deficiencies (FSD)
       (conditions that cannot directly cause a fire but will increase risk to personnel or property
       if a fire occurs).
22                                      AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012


         3.3.3.1.1. NFPA 1, Uniform Fire Code TIG, provides the standard for fire prevention
         inspection requirements except as modified by UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection
         Engineering for Facilities. Due to the complexity of AF missions and facilities, other
         AF Instructions or publications may apply.
         3.3.3.1.2. UFC 3-600-02, Operations and Maintenance: Inspection, Testing, and
         Maintenance of Fire Protection Systems, provides the standard for installed fire
         detection/suppression system inspection requirements. Technical guidance on the
         execution of the identified tasks is found in specific NFPA Standards and Guides as
         well as the system’s manufacturer’s guidance.
     3.3.3.2. Facility managers or their designee shall accompany the fire inspector during the
     inspection. Functional managers must sign any AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit
     Reports, issued against facilities and operations under their control that identified
     uncorrected hazards or FSDs.
  3.3.4. Code enforcement includes authority delegated by the installation commander to the
  Fire Chief to affect actions necessary to correct fire hazards and deficiencies. The using
  organization’s commander is responsible for ORMs to mitigate fire hazards and deficiencies
  for their area of responsibility. The Fire Chief is responsible to track mitigation actions until
  deficiency is corrected or waived.
     3.3.4.1. Using organization’s commander is responsible to correct fire hazards and
     deficiencies. The Fire Chief establishes reasonable timelines for the initiation of
     corrective actions. When these timelines are not met, the Fire Chief notifies the next
     higher commander progressively up to the installation commander.
     3.3.4.2. Management of fire hazards will be IAW AFI 91-301, Inspector General
     Complaints Resolution. Fire hazards must be corrected on the spot or annotated on AF
     Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report. Fire inspectors may be delegated authority by
     the Fire Chief to initiate required corrective actions to ensure the safety of personnel and
     resources. This may include requiring using organization to lock out/tag out defective
     equipment, stop hazardous operations, and restrict occupancy or use of facilities.
     3.3.4.3. FSDs are prioritized according to the risk they pose. Fire inspectors document
     FSDs on AF Form 1487 and determine the FSD Code. When deficiencies cannot be
     corrected immediately, the using organization’s commander initiates corrective action
     and prepares an ORM plan that mitigates the impact of the FSD. The ORM plan must
     ensure the safety of all occupants to the satisfaction of the Fire Chief. The ORM plan
     must be approved by the installation commander.
  3.3.5. Fire safety education is an essential part of workplace safety training, and is promoted
  during fire inspections and other personal contacts. It may be tailored for specific audiences
  and purposes, such as fire extinguisher training or public assembly employee training. Fire
  safety education objectives are to equip personnel with the information needed to prevent
  fires, protect themselves and intervene early when fire occurs.
     3.3.5.1. Fire Prevention Week (normally the first week of October) is a nationally
     established period to provide fire safety education to employees, their families and the
     public. FESs are encouraged to hold Open Houses and other events to publicize the
     annual fire safety message. The Fire Chief should budget for fire prevention and/or safety
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                         23


      materials, including nominal value incentive and educational items, as an integral part of
      the Public Fire Education Program to promote fire prevention and safety IAW DoDI
      6055.06
   3.3.6. Use AF Form 218, Facility Fire Prevention and Protection Record, or automated
   product as a checklist and to record results of facility inspections. Facility inspection records
   shall be entered into ACES-FD.
   3.3.7. Use AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report, or automated product, to identify
   the condition of the fire prevention program to commanders. Fire prevention visit reports
   shall be entered into ACES-FD.
   3.3.8. Installed Fire Protection Systems. Fire Chiefs must monitor the status of systems and
   devices provided to facilitate fire safety for personnel and property. The CE Operations
   (CEO) Flight is responsible to maintain these systems. This includes the procurement of
   agents required for re-servicing fire suppression systems.
      3.3.8.1. The CEO Flight Chief ensures the inspection, testing, repair, and maintenance of
      fire protection systems and water distribution systems are conducted in accordance with
      UFC 3-600-02, Operations and Maintenance: Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of
      Fire Protection Systems; and UFC 3-230-02, Operation and Maintenance: Water Supply
      Systems. Fire protection system impairments and systems out of service, to include water
      distribution systems, must be reported immediately to the Emergency Communication
      Center (ECC) and FES fire prevention office. CEO Flight Chief will prioritize repair of
      fire protection systems IAW AFPAM 32-1004, Volume 3, Working in the Operations
      Flight Facility Maintenance
      3.3.8.2. CEO personnel or contractor equivalent must record all water distribution tests
      on AF Form 1027, Water Flow Test Record, or automated product, and provide copies
      to the Fire Chief annually.
3.4. FES Training. The Fire Chief establishes a program that encompasses certification, and
proficiency training requirements. All military AFSC 3E7XX, civilian GS-0081 and NSPS, GS-
2151 (serving as FES Dispatchers) and contractor-operated fire department members will be
certified according to DoD 6055.06-M, DoD Fire & Emergency Services Certification System,
(FESCS).
   3.4.1. FES personnel shall meet the training requirements IAW NFPA Std. 1500 Chapter 5
   as specified in the FESAP. Trainers shall record all FES proficiency and certification training
   in ACES-FD.
   3.4.2. Where foreign national/host nation firefighters are employed, fire chiefs with
   MAJCOM coordination and approval, have the authority to approve equivalent certification
   and training requirements according to specific job assignments and agreements with the host
   nation. Fire Chiefs will ensure certification requirements are equal to or exceed NFPA
   standards and those outlined in the FESCS.
   3.4.3. Training to achieve FESCS certification is a personal responsibility. Supervisors
   facilitate certification by providing guidance, access to training materials, instruction, and
   through performance testing required for certification. Training to achieve FESCS
   certification is available to each AF employee at no cost to the unit or individual. Fire chiefs
 24                                      AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012


   may approve attendance at AF/DoD formal training venues. Acquiring training for FESCS
   certification from external (non-AF/DoD) contract sources at government expense requires
   review and approval by the Command Fire Chief.
   3.4.4. Certification in the FESCS will be granted only for skills required for the current duty
   position and the next-higher position to which an individual may be promoted (Exception:
   When directed by the Fire Chief, vehicle crew members may accomplish Fire Inspector II
   certifications to allow ―crew inspections‖ of facilities as appropriate). Certifications will not
   be issued for training or testing more than five years old. Command Fire Chiefs may approve
   waivers based on unique mission needs. All MAJCOM approved waivers will be included in
   the individual certification package when submitted to AFCESA/CEXF for consideration.
   3.4.5. Deployed firefighters will meet forward operating location proficiency training
   requirements and are exempt from home station proficiency training during the period of
   deployment. Upon return from deployment, home station proficiency training may be
   credited as current on the date of return to duty with approval of the Fire Chief. Training for
   recurring certifications must be completed based on required timelines, example: HazMat,
   Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) etc.
   3.4.6. AFCESA/CEXF is responsible for approving and investigating effective and cost-
   efficient methods to provide proficiency, Phase 2 commissioning and certification training.
   AFCESA/CEOA maintains environmentally acceptable design plans and drawings for
   aircraft live-fire training facilities and is responsible for Phase 1 commissioning and design
   modifications. Aircraft live-fire training facilities will be maintained and operated in
   accordance with Technical Order (TO) 35E1-2-13-1, Operation and Maintenance Instruction
   Manual Aircraft Fire Training Facility. This TO is managed by the AFCESA/CEXF
   Technical Content Manager (TCM). Mobile fire trainers will be operated and maintained in
   accordance with manufacturer specifications and instructions. Structural fire training facility
   designs and commercially procured products must satisfy the performance test elements of
   Firefighter II, as specified in NFPA Std. 1001, Standard for Firefighter Professional
   Qualifications. Structural fire training facilities using liquid petroleum gas for fire training
   will meet national safety standards. All live-fire structural training shall be conducted in
   accordance with NFPA Std. 1500 and NFPA Std. 1403, Standard on Live Fire Training
   Evolutions.
3.5. FES Operations. The goal of this program is to intervene early at emergency events with
appropriate resources according to response standards indicated in paragraph 2.6. Available
resources dictate the level of service that is provided.
   3.5.1. The core missions of the operations section include on-scene incident management,
   aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), structural firefighting, hazmat mitigation, technical
   rescue, and EMS support.
   3.5.2. Incident Management. The Fire Chief manages emergency incidents according to
   the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) defined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force
   Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. The Incident Command
   System (ICS) is a component of the AFIMS. ICS is a standardized on-scene emergency
   management structure used for managing all emergencies, large or small.
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                        25


     3.5.2.1. AFIMS shall serve as the installation standard for incident management for large
     events involving multiple organization responses. NFPA Std. 1561, Standard on
     Emergency Services Incident Management System, shall serve as the FES flight
     framework for single FES event responses.
     3.5.2.2. The Incident Commander (IC) is the individual responsible for all incident
     activities, including firefighter safety, development of an Incident Action Plan, and
     utilization of all emergency resources. The IC has overall authority and responsibility for
     conducting incident operations and is responsible for the management of all incident
     operations at the incident site. An IC is required for each incident regardless of size or
     complexity.
     3.5.2.3. All FES personnel that respond to FES emergencies will receive progressive IC
     training as indicated in the FESAP training section.
     3.5.2.4. Incident Safety Officer (ISO). ISO responsibilities shall be accomplished at all
     incidents and during training evolutions involving fire. When responding off base, the
     Fire Chief will appoint an ISO to observe AF operations. If unsafe conditions are
     observed or encountered by AF firefighters, the ISO will mitigate the condition and
     inform the IC.
     3.5.2.5. The Fire Chief, with the approval of the Installation Commander, will determine
     those agencies that are authorized transceiver access to the fire and crash radio networks.
     A minimum of two radio frequencies are required for use by the fire department to
     provide sufficient command and control. One frequency will be limited to fire department
     access only for tactical fire ground operations. A third frequency may be required to
     support mutual assistance operations. Ground-to-aircraft communication requirements are
     determined by the local commander.
  3.5.3. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF). ARFF capabilities are based on the
  quantity of fire fighting agent, agent discharge rates, the number of fire fighting vehicles,
  availability of firefighters, and response times to perform initial fire ground operations for an
  installation’s largest assigned aircraft.
     3.5.3.1. It is a core mission to rescue aircrew members from aircraft involved in
     accident/fire incidents. At locations with a flying mission, rescue personnel designated by
     the Fire Chief must be trained in aircrew rescue and extraction techniques on mission
     assigned aircraft as identified in TO 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and
     Mishap Response Information (Emergency Services).
  3.5.4. Structural Fire Fighting. Structural fire responses are based on life safety as well as
  the priority of the facility as it relates to mission criticality. Response times shall be IAW
  Attachment 3.
  3.5.5. HazMat and CBRNE. The Fire Chief will maintain a defensive capability to respond
  to HazMat and CBRNE incidents. The flight’s core capability during these incidents include
  command, control, communications; accountability; fire suppression; rescue and extrication;
  emergency decontamination and preserving evidence performed by HazMat Operations
  certified responders.
26                                    AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012


     3.5.5.1. Limited atmospheric monitoring, detection; mass decontamination and
     operations in the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) locations will only
     be performed when qualified personnel and adequate resources to effectively mitigate the
     incident are available.
     3.5.5.2. Neutralization, recovery, cleanup, and disposition of hazardous waste are
     accomplished by trained experts in related fields and are not a function of FES personnel.
     Follow requirements established by 29 CFR Part 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations
     and Emergency Response; DoDI 2000.18, Department of Defense Installation Chemical,
     Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive Emergency Response
     Guidelines; and NFPA Std. 472, Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous
     Materials Incidents.
     3.5.5.3. When day-to-day FES flight staffing is insufficient to accomplish offensive
     HazMat operations, the Fire Chief will work with the installation leadership to develop a
     non-traditional plan which may include options such as relying on regional HazMat
     teams, supplementing FES manpower with other on-base personnel who have been
     adequately trained and equipped (e.g., CE Waste Water Treatment Plant personnel,
     Bioenvironmental, Readiness/EM personnel, etc.).
     3.5.5.4. Installation Commander shall identify properly trained personnel outside FES to
     provide medical support, chemical detection, personnel decontamination, and other tasks
     not specifically required to be accomplished by FES.
  3.5.6. Technical Rescue. The Fire Chief will maintain a capability to perform rescues
  related to the FES core missions. This capability may be integrated with other functions
  through cross staffing or provided as a stand-alone capability. The Fire Chief determines the
  number and selects firefighters who require advanced rescue technician training and
  certification based on the mission needs of the installation.
     3.5.6.1. Based upon installation-specific requirements, some FES personnel may require
     training in special operations such as confined space, high/low angle rope rescue, urban
     search and rescue, vehicle extrication and water rescue. Where possible, utilize mutual
     aid partners technical rescue capabilities to prevent unnecessary duplication of resources.
  3.5.7. Emergency Medical Services. The EMS program and responsibility to deliver EMS
  services is owned by the medical group commander. The medical group commander
  recommends and the installation commander approves the level of care to be provided. In
  addition, the medical group commander establishes response time standards, standards of
  care, protocols, and provides training, resources and program oversight. At locations without
  a medical group commander, EMS guidance is provided by the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
  Medical Authority.
     3.5.7.1. FES flights may assist the installation’s primary medical provider (Medical
     Group or contract) within the limits of training and resources and guidelines specified in
     Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A). This support role entails
     responding to EMS emergencies for early intervention with life-saving care. If first to
     arrive, firefighters transfer treatment to the EMS provider upon their arrival and are
     available to respond to other FES emergencies. Patient care can only be transferred when
     the primary EMS provider has an equal or higher level of training and certification.
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                     27


         3.5.7.1.1. Tenant Ambulance Crews (contractor and/or Medical Group). Due to the
         time response requirement for fire station locations, the FES flight serves as an ideal
         host for an ambulance crew staging area. FES flights hosting a non-fire managed
         ambulance service shall develop an MOA/U with the Medical Group and outline
         specific operational and safety requirements for tenant compliance. As a minimum,
         bio-hazard waste disposition, infectious disease control measures, and exposure
         protection practices shall be addressed. Whenever guidance is lacking regarding non-
         fire EMS crew policies, applicable NFPA standards shall be used.
     3.5.7.2. Any role in EMS above the support role outlined above must be clearly
     articulated in a Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A), coordinated by the
     MAJCOM A7C and Surgeon General, and approved by AF/A7C and AF/SGO before
     assignment to the FES flight. The MOU/A must address medical dispatch, resource
     requirements, training/certification requirements, medical logistics, funding, medical
     authority, protocols, program oversight, command and control, insurance and billing
     procedures, and personal and organizational liability. Any contract or agreements with
     the local community is the responsibility of the medical group commander and is not tied
     to fire departments’ mutual aid agreement. The FES flight will have no role in providing
     contract oversight, administration, QAE, etc. These functions are solely the responsibility
     of the medical group commander and will not be delegated to the FES flight.
  3.5.8. Hazardous Standbys. FES will support aircraft hazardous standbys outlined in TO
  00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding and other applicable
  aircraft technical orders as deemed necessary by the Fire Chief. Due to the necessity to cross
  staff emergency response vehicles and maintain the ready posture of the FES flight the focus
  should be to correct hazardous operations before they begin and limit support only to critical
  mission requirements.

                                            Chapter 4

                                          RESOURCES

4.1. Emergency Response Resources. Primary FES resources are fire vehicles, manpower and
equipment. Fire vehicles are authorized to deliver command and control, emergency
communications, fire fighting agent and equipment to FES events as needed. Manpower is
authorized to accomplish tasks necessary to manage emergency operations, such as operating
hose lines, operating vehicles and pumps; ventilating facilities; search and rescue; life-saving
emergency care; and command and control. Fire Chiefs allocate available resources to manage
FES events based on circumstances and local risk factors. Senior fire officers on scene ensure
tasks are assigned to firefighters that can be performed safely with available resources.
   4.1.1. Manpower authorizations determined by using Air Force Manpower Standard
   (AFMS) 44EF, Fire Emergency Services Manpower Standard are based on fire ground
   capabilities. The number of authorizations is predicated on managing one major FES event at
   a time. Assigning firefighters to duties outside the core missions negatively affects
   emergency response posture and are not recommended. Fire Chief’s will approve duties
   outside the FES flight.
       4.1.1.1. Ancillary Training and Additional Duties/Details. Firefighters shall not have
       additional duties, details, training, medical/dental appointments or other official duties
       assigned outside the normal 72-hour scheduled work week (except for disciplinary
       purposes). Off-duty time for firefighters will be treated in the same manner that weekends
       are treated for other AF members. Increasing the normal work hours is only acceptable to
       provide CLS capability.
   4.1.2. Fire Vehicles are authorized in Allowance Standard (AS) 019, Vehicle Fleet
   (Registered) All MAJCOM. The type and size of vehicle is calculated based on the need to
   deliver fire fighting agents for aircraft and structure fires, specialized equipment, and
   command and control.
       4.1.2.1. The AF has designated six Fire Fighting Vehicle Core Sets based on the overall
       length and external fuselage width of the installation’s largest assigned aircraft. The
       larger the aircraft, the more fire fighting agent, discharge rates, fire fighting vehicles and
       firefighters required for an initial aircraft response.
           4.1.2.1.1. Set 1 ARFF capabilities are adequate for small-frame aircraft such as F-15.
           4.1.2.1.2. Set 2 ARFF capabilities are adequate for small-frame aircraft such as C-20.
           4.1.2.1.3. Set 3 ARFF capabilities are adequate for medium-frame aircraft such as C-
           130.
           4.1.2.1.4. Set 4 ARFF capabilities are adequate for large-frame aircraft such as C-17
           and KC-135.
           4.1.2.1.5. Set 5 ARFF capabilities are adequate for large-frame aircraft such as KC-
           10, VC-25.
           4.1.2.1.6. Set 6 ARFF capabilities are adequate for large-frame aircraft such as C-5.
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                       29


       4.1.2.2. Force Activity Designator (FAD) codes for fire fighting vehicles, equipment,
       and supplies will be equal to the flying mission or highest mission being supported as
       prescribed in AFI 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.
       4.1.2.3. Service testing and annual inspections of all fire vehicle pump systems shall be
       accomplished IAW NFPA Std. 1911, Inspection, Maintenance, Testing, and Retirement
       of In-Service Automotive Fire Apparatus and Records. All worksheets and forms used in
       the testing process shall be maintained IAW Air Force Restoration Information
       Management System (AFRIMS) guidelines. Record inspection results electronically
       and/or into ACES-FD when available. All worksheets and forms used in the inspection
       process shall be maintained IAW AFRIMS guidelines.
       4.1.2.4. Fire Chiefs will maintain sufficient stock levels of fire fighting support
       equipment. AS 490, Civil Engineer Fire Protection Support and Aircraft Crash Rescue
       Equipment, provides the primary basis of issue. Fire Chiefs determine the reserve levels
       of specialized equipment.
       4.1.2.5. All ancillary fire ground and training equipment (ladder, self contained breathing
       apparatus, hose, rope, powered equipment, etc.) will be maintained IAW the applicable
       NFPA standards or technical data. Inspection, maintenance and testing records will be
       maintained in ACES-FD. All worksheets and forms used in the inspection process shall
       be maintained IAW AFRIMS guidelines.
   4.1.3. Fire Chiefs will determine the quantity of reserve firefighting agents based on mission
   requirements and establish procedures to expediently transport agent to emergency incidents.
4.2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Uniforms. All military firefighters are issued
PPE as outlined in Attachment 8. PPE is permanently issued to military firefighters at the first
duty location as professional gear. It is hand-carried between duty stations and reflected in
Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders. Upon PCS the Fire Chief will provide an AF Form
538, Personal Clothing and Equipment Record, annotating PPE issued; copies of Self
Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) mask fit test records, documentation of servicing,
testing, and maintaining of the SCBA mask. All PPE is hand carried to the next duty station.
   4.2.1. Personnel being discharged from active duty service and selected for transition to
   ANG or AFRC will transfer with PPE, excluding SCBA masks. For civilian firefighters, the
   losing Fire Chief determines the disposition of PPE. If the employee is allowed to take the
   PPE, the gaining fire chief will be notified. Military firefighters not assigned to FES flights
   (instructor, staff, etc.) will be issued PPE at their next duty assignment. The Fire Chief will
   ensure all PPE is inspected IAW NFPA Std. 1851, Standard on Selection, Care, and
   Maintenance of Protective Ensembles for Structural Fire Fighting and Proximity Fire
   Fighting and is safe to use.
   4.2.2. Station Work Uniforms. FES personnel who are issued PPE and all civilians receiving
   a uniform allowance must wear station work uniforms while assigned to an apparatus,
   conforming to the requirements in NFPA Std. 1975, Station Work Uniforms. For military
   firefighters, these uniforms are provided by the unit. For civilian employees who receive a
   uniform allowance, the work station uniform is purchased by the individual from sources
   approved by the Fire Chief.
30                                    AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012


  4.2.3. Fire Protection Badge. AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
  Personnel, and AFI 36-801, Uniforms for Civilian Employees, prescribe the wearing of the
  fire protection badge. There are four fire emergency services duty-badges: (1) Firefighter
  (one trumpet/scramble); (2) Assistant Chiefs (operations, prevention, and training) (gold
  shield with three trumpets); (3) Deputy Chief (gold shield with four trumpets); and (4) Fire
  Chief (gold shield with five trumpets). FES personnel shall wear the duty badge appropriate
  to their position within the FES flight if properly certified.
     4.2.3.1. Fire Marshals may wear the Fire Chief duty badge after completing the Fire
     Marshal Course, X30ZR32E4 0F1A, and may continue to wear it in all subsequent duty
     positions that include FES management and oversight responsibilities.
     4.2.3.2. The Commander, Louis F. Garland DoD Fire Academy shall wear the Fire Chief
     duty badge. Course supervisors shall wear the Assistant Chief duty badge. Fire instructors
     at all FES training sites shall wear the firefighter duty badge.
     4.2.3.3. AFCESA/CEXF, Command FES, and 3E7XX Inspector General staff members

                                           Chapter 5

                          EXTERNAL AGENCY COORDINATION

5.1. External Agency Coordination. The Installation Commander may establish a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with civilian communities or other government agencies to
offset internal shortfalls in FES staffing, vehicles, or equipment if the MOA does not violate the
prohibitions of 10 USC 2465, Prohibition on Contracts for the Performance of Fire Fighting or
Security-Guard Functions.
   5.1.1. Mutual Aid Agreements. The Fire Chief manages mutual aid agreements in
   accordance with Attachment 5 (US) and Attachment 6 (Foreign) of this instruction. The
   format and substantive provisions for these agreements may be modified or supplemented,
   subject to a legal review by the Installation Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), and approval by the
   installation commander. If the AF provides fire fighting services at joint-use civilian airports,
   include a release and indemnification clause in accordance with Attachment 7. AF fire
   departments may be part of automatic response agreements with local communities when
   approved by the Installation Commander. Emergency responses to local communities must
   be approved by the Installation Commander and shall be in accordance with AFI 10-802,
   Military Support to Civil Authorities. Coordinate requests for reimbursement of emergency
   services support provided during responses with the installation financial management staff
   in accordance with DoD Directive 3025.1, Military Support to Civil Authorities, and AFI 65-
   601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
   5.1.2. Promulgation of mutual aid agreements with surrounding communities is encouraged
   to improve capability to manage large FES events. Requests for assistance under such
   agreements should be honored except when an actual FES event is in progress on the
   installation or when supporting the request would reduce AF capability below the CLS.
   5.1.3. The CLS is an acceptable level of service when required to honor requests for
   assistance from mutual aid partners.
   5.1.4. Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). Procedures for response to requests for
   assistance from civil authorities are prescribed in DoD Directive 3025.1 and AFI 10-802.
   DSCA responses include mutual aid responses and are reported to the Command Post. Costs
   associated with DSCA responses, other than support to mutual aid partners, may be
   reimbursable. Record expenses incurred for all DSCA responses in ACES-FD. Consult the
   local comptroller to develop procedures to seek reimbursement for FES support.
   5.1.5. National Response Framework and National Incident Management System. Homeland
   Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5) implements the National Incident Management
   System (NIMS). HSPD-5 is implemented in the AF with AFIMS. The Fire Chief must
   coordinate with local emergency response agencies to familiarize each other with the IMS
   used and develop procedures to integrate the IMS systems.
   5.1.6. Off-Base Familiarization. FES personnel will become familiar, at least annually, with
   areas surrounding the base where they may provide mutual aid or assistance. Fire chiefs will
   maintain copies of civilian community fire department emergency response plans for high
   hazard areas when those communities maintain such plans and where permitted by host
   nation/local laws.
32                                     AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012


  5.1.7. Fire Incident Investigations. Fire investigations are performed in accordance with AFI
  91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. For Class C incidents, the installation Fire Chief
  determines the most probable cause. For Class A & B incidents, the Safety Investigation
  Board President will request support from the MAJCOM FES staff to conduct the fire
  investigation. Any time FES tactics or competency is an issue, the convening authority will
  request investigative support from the MAJCOM FES staff.
  5.1.8. FES Response Reporting. The Fire Chief reports FES responses as prescribed at
  Attachment 2.
  5.1.9. Pre-Incident Plans. The Fire Chief will develop pre-incident plans for facilities with
  large fire or life loss potential, hazardous operations, all assigned aircraft and any transient
  aircraft as the Fire Chief deems necessary. Facility pre-incident plans are recorded on AF
  Form 1028, Facility Pre-Fire Plan, or computer generated equivalent form and entered in
  ACES-FD. Aircraft pre-incident plans are recorded on AFTO Form 88, Aircraft Pre-Fire
  Plan, or computer generated equivalent form and entered in ACES-FD. AFCESA/CEXF is
  responsible for the development, maintenance, and web management of TO 00-105E-9,
  Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency Services). This
  TO is managed by the AFCESA/CEXF Technical Content Manager (TCM). The TO
  provides aircraft emergency rescue, fire fighting, and hazardous materials information and
  procedures.
  5.1.10. Prior Notification of Exercises. The Fire Chief or senior fire official (SFO) on duty
  must receive at least a 30-minute prior notification when exercises involve fire fighting
  vehicles, equipment, or personnel.
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                       33


                                           Chapter 6

                        RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

6.1. Risk Assessment and Management. Fire Chiefs are responsible for managing available
resources to minimize risk to people, property, and the environment. Risk decisions based on
fact-based analysis provide a high degree of confidence that FES events will be managed
appropriately with available resources. Risk assessments based on actual emergency response
data, tempered with sound professional judgment, provides the best opportunity for effectively
managing FES events.
   6.1.1. Failure to provide adequate fire prevention services poses the greatest potential for
   long-term negative impact on fire safety. MAJCOM Directors, Installation Commanders and
   Fire Chiefs must ensure prevention programs including engineering controls, education, and
   enforcement receives the highest priority to effectively mitigate hazards.
   6.1.2. The FES operations function is critical to the safety of people and property during
   emergencies. When emergencies occur, early intervention is the critical factor in reducing the
   potential for damage, injury and death. For this reason, response time standards are crucial to
   initial success.
   6.1.3. The level of service provided must be balanced based on risk, probability of incidents
   and available resources. Although the RLS may provide resources needed to accomplish
   successful operations, it must be measured against historic response data to ensure resources
   are sufficient for the risk. When the CLS is reached, leaders must recognize the severe
   limitations of FES capability. There are, however, periods where the Installation Commander
   and Fire Chief must consider a reduction of service. These include but are not limited to:
       6.1.3.1. Vehicles out of service, sick leaves, deployments, or support to mutual aid
       partners.
       6.1.3.2. Periods of reduced activity or ―down days‖ when normal base operations
       (example, flying, aircraft maintenance or wing support functions) are suspended.
6.2. Allocating Resources. Resources are authorized to provide the OLS; however it is
reasonable to assume not all authorized resources will be continuously available. Consequently,
the RLS is expected to occur frequently and for extended periods at most installations. During
RLS the Fire Chief must ensure resources are allocated based on local risk factors, varying
resources according to the risk periods while ensuring a CLS within the response time standards
to each FDZ (see Attachment 4). Use local emergency response data and the following facts to
allocate resources:
   6.2.1. Many FES events can be managed with one fire vehicle responding within the
   response time standard for early intervention. Firefighting is a labor-intensive task that
   requires adequate staffing to perform in as safe a manner as possible. Consequently, fire
   chiefs must actively manage FES events to reduce risk to firefighters and ensure rapid
   intervention teams are available.
   6.2.2. Most FES events occur during normal duty hours or periods of normal activities.
 34                                     AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012


   6.2.3. Most FES events occur when/where people are present and rarely occur in unoccupied
   buildings or parked aircraft that are not being maintained.
6.3. Mitigating Risk. Fire chiefs have wide latitude to manage risk by allocating resources
according to local risk factors, to provide capability within the limits of available resources.
   6.3.1. Except to provide CLS capability, dramatic actions such as, increased work hours
   and/or contractor support should not be necessary. By allocating available resources (vehicles
   in service and firefighters for a maximum of 72 hours per week), an acceptable level of
   service can normally be provided. Options to maximize available manpower resources
   include:
       6.3.1.1. Adjusting work schedules so more resources are available during higher risk
       periods and fewer during lower risk periods
       6.3.1.2. Assigning management and administrative personnel to the Operations Section
       as training and certifications allow.
   6.3.2. Cross staffing and utilizing administrative personnel provides additional FES
   capability and can mitigate manpower shortages.
   6.3.3. To ensure firefighters are postured for emergency response, an AF CE goal was
   established to reduce hazardous standbys using CY06 data as the baseline. Unless prescribed
   in AF policy, standbys will be limited to temporary abnormal situations such as equipment
   failures, as determined by the Fire Chief and Installation Commander IAW TO 00-25-172.
6.4. Risk Management.
   6.4.1. The Fire Chief will establish management plans addressing reduced operational
   capability during periods of time when the department will operate below OLS as determined
   using the guide described in Attachment 4. The plan must include control measures
   implemented by the Fire Chief that describe both the probability and consequence of the
   potential risk. These components include predicting the consequence of the identified risk
   and the probability of the event occurring. Control measures can include varying the
   available resources by time of day and day of the week based on the predicted probability
   while considering the consequence during both periods of risk. These plans are developed in
   advance when possible and consider the following factors:
       6.4.1.1. An assumption that only one major FES event will occur at a time. All available
       FES resources may be employed to manage a single large FES event.
       6.4.1.2. Historic emergency response data proves early intervention by occupants,
       operators or firefighters occurs at almost every FES event, preventing major events that
       require extensive resources.
   6.4.2. Fire Chiefs are empowered to implement management actions necessary to
   continuously maintain the CLS for each FDZ. The Fire Chief develops ORM plans in
   advance for review by the Fire Marshal and approval by the installation commander. When
   shortages are not known in advance, previously developed management plans and response
   procedure will be executed by the Fire Chief as required.
6.5. Level of Service Capability Reporting.
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                           35


   6.5.1. CLS capability must be maintained at all times. Whenever CLS capability cannot be
   continuously provided resources shall be allocated to provide increased capability. Deviating
   below CLS requires the Fire Chief prepare an ORM IAW paragraph 2.10.
   6.5.2. To ensure commanders are aware of reduced capability, fire chiefs will make the
   following notifications:
       6.5.2.1. When the AMO or available agent is or will be reduced below 75 percent, the
       Fire Chief notifies the Fire Marshal.
       6.5.2.2. When the AMO or available agent is reduced below 50 percent, the Fire Marshal
       or Fire Chief make appropriate notifications to inform the Installation Commander and
       MAJCOM FES Staff.
       6.5.2.3. When the CLS is not or will not be available for any period of time within a
       FDZ, the Fire Marshal or Fire Chief makes appropriate notifications to inform the
       Installation Commander and MAJCOM FES Staff. Seven firefighters and the required
       agent for the assigned vehicle set is the CLS. See Attachment 4.
6.6. Minimum Manning Standards. Except to provide the CLS for each FDZ, a minimum
number of firefighters required to be available is not specified by this instruction. Minimum
manning standards that prescribe a number of firefighters that prevent varying the LOS based on
risk factors are prohibited. Fire Chiefs have wide latitude to allocate resources according to local
risk factors. Such standards restrict the fire chief’s ability to allocate resources according to risk
factors; a fundamental tenet of FES risk management.

Terms
Adjusted Manpower for Operations (AMO)—is the total number of operations personnel
needed to accomplish all fire ground tasks without multi-tasking. AMO is determined by
dividing the total authorizations for operations by the manpower availability factor 2.64. The
result is the number of personnel expected for duty when all authorized personnel are available.
The AMO is based on typical structural and aircraft firefighting tasks.
Aggregate Response Times (ART)—Total of dispatch time, turnout time, and travel time. The
time elapsed from the receipt of the emergency alarm to when the units arrive on scene.
Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Vehicle—Vehicles designed to deliver and
dispense fire fighting agents on fires involving aircraft or liquid fuels
Air Force Fire Emergency Services Community of Practice (AF FES CoP)—The official
web site for AF FES.
Automated Civil Engineer System – Fire Department (ACES-FD)—A comprehensive and
automated dispatch system, and data collection and retrieval system mandatory for use in all AF
FES flights excluding expeditionary flights.
Critical Level of Service (CLS)—The level of capability when resources available provide at
least one appropriate vehicle and crew to each FDZ within the response time standard. Although
acceptable, CLS is the absolute minimum level of service and should only be allowed for short
durations. At this level firefighting forces can provide rescue and quick fire attack operations for
a short duration. Firefighting crews may provide limited search and rescue, and property
conservation during this period; however, these operational capabilities cannot be sustained
without additional resources.
AFI32-2001_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 21 JUNE 2012                                                         43


DoD Component—USAF, USA, USN, USMC, and the Defense Logistics Agency
DoD Fire Emergency Services Certification System (FESCS)—A nationally accredited
system that validates training received by DoD emergency responders and issues certifications.
Fire Demand Zone (FDZ)—A specific area within a fire district that demands similar resources,
tactics and strategy to manage FES events.
Fire District—The geographical area that a fire station serves.
Fire Vehicles—Emergency response vehicles designed to pump or carry fire extinguishing
agents to the scene of a fire, transport specialized equipment required for FES operations, or
provide command and control capability. Fire vehicles include command, pumper, rescue,
HazMat, aerial, or ARFF vehicles.
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)—A national organization, recognized as the
authority for all matters involving fire emergencies that publishes national consensus standards
and the National Fire Codes.
National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS)—A national database of emergency
response data, owned by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and managed by the United States Fire Administration. NFIRS is
the mandatory central depository used by all DoD FES response organizations. ACES-FD sends
response data to the Naval Safety Center for population of the NFIRS database.
Optimum Level of Service (OLS)—The level of service available when 90 to 100 percent of
AMO required resources (vehicles set to provide required agent, required discharge capacity; and
required manpower for fireground capability) are available. At the OLS, a maximum level of
service can be continuously provided, when determined appropriate by the Fire Chief. During
OLS, firefighting forces are capable of providing all services continuously throughout an event
with reasonable expectation of successful offensive fire attack operations, search and rescue, and
property conservation.
Reduced Level of Service (RLS)—The level of FES capability that exceeds the critical but is
less than the optimum level of service. During this level adequate firefighting capability can be
provided by utilizing cross staffing, selective response and sound fireground tactics. At the RLS,
firefighting forces should be successful in offensive fire attack operations, search and rescue, and
property conservation; however, operations may not be sustainable throughout an event without
additional resources.
Senior Fire Official (SFO)—The senior official at the scene of an emergency.

                                FES RESPONSE REPORTING

A2.1. Initial Notification:
   A2.1.1. Within 6 hours of the beginning of a significant FES emergency event, provide
   notification to AFCESA/CEXF and Command FES office by phone (after duty hours) or
   email (during duty hours). Significant FES emergency events result in:
       A2.1.1.1. A loss of $50,000 or more to military family housing (combined Air Force and
       non-Air Force loss). NOTE: Report responses to privatized or leased housing incidents as
       mutual assistance responses when US Air Force organizations provide initial response
       services.
       A2.1.1.2. A loss of $100,000 or more (combined Air Force and non-Air Force loss).
       A2.1.1.3. Loss of life or lost time injury due to a fire related event.
       A2.1.1.4. Injury to FES personnel occurred during the emergency operation.
       A2.1.1.5. Adverse public reaction.
       A2.1.1.6. Mutual aid responses that require extensive use of personnel or equipment to
       suppress major fires, assist in mass injury or casualty recovery, or have significant public
       impact potential.
       A2.1.1.7. Any event that that generates OPREP 3.
   A2.1.2. Initial notification methods:
       A2.1.2.1. During normal duty hours (0700-1600 Central Standard Time), the MAJCOM,
       FOA, or base FES office will up-channel information by email (designate as high
       importance) to afcesa.cexf@tyndall.af.mil. Attach the report generated by the Fire
       Emergency Response Notification System (FERNS) (available at the AF FES CoP).

                              DETERMINING RISK PERIODS

A4.1. Method to determine the higher risk response periods:
   A4.1.1. Step 1: Using response data from NFIRS, determine highest number of responses in
   an hour: 5171 in the example below.
   A4.1.2. Step 2: Determine 50 percent of Step 1: 2586 in the example below.
   A4.1.3. Hours with 2586 responses or more are in the higher risk period.
   A4.1.4. Hours with less than 2586 responses are in the lower risk period.
A4.2. Black line indicates break point in this example.
   A4.2.1. In this example, the period from 0700 – 1800 is the higher risk period and accounts
   for over 67 percent of the total emergency responses. Note that this chart represents the
   average responses for a year, which includes holiday periods. Considered separately, holiday
   periods are very low risk.

Figure A4.1. Risk Response Period.




A4.3. FES Capability Charts. The following chart illustrates the variation in capability
according to the number of firefighters available to respond to an incident within a Fire Demand
Zone (FDZ). The Incident Commander (IC) determines the required vehicles and manpower
based on the type and magnitude of the incident. Further, the IC determines the type of resources

needed, when and where they are deployed, and personnel required to accomplish fire ground
tasks. The following list of positions and capabilities shall be considered at each FES event:
   A4.3.1. Incident Commander

NOTE:
   1. The adjusted manpower for operations (AMO) is based on personnel assigned to
   operations on a 72 hour work week. The position manpower factor (PMF) 2.634 is multiplied
   against the number of firefighters required to perform fire ground operations based on
   structural firefighting, aircraft category and the vehicle set. It further factors the .634 as
   unavailable personnel due to Kelly-days and other absences.Example: AMO 20 x 2.634 =

  3. At the optimum level of service (OLS) 90% to 100% of the AMO and agent required for
  Q1+Q2+Q3 (NFPA 403) is available. At this level, sufficient capability exists to accomplish
  all tasks required to manage typical FES incidents.
  4. At the reduced level of service (RLS), essential tasks can be accomplished but multi-
  tasking will be required and sustaining operation will become increasingly difficult as
  manpower decreases and/or the incident escalates
  5. The critical level of service (CLS) is the minimum capability that must be maintained at
  all times. At this level of capability, firefighters can accomplish quick attack (two hose lines)
  but cannot sustain operations beyond the initial agent capacity of fire vehicles. This level of
  service is reserved for only short-durations necessitated by unanticipated personnel absences
  and equipment failure and/or very low risk periods such as holidays. CLS is further defined
  as the first arriving company at remote and outlying areas where additional resources may
  not arrive within 12 minutes.
