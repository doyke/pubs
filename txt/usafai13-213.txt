                                           Chapter 1

 RESPONSIBILITIES OF AGENCIES INVOLVED WITH THE AIRFIELD DRIVING
                        TRAINING PROGRAM

1.1. Concept.
   1.1.1. The 306th Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Assistant Airfield Manager (AAFM)
   or designated representative is the OPR for the USAFA Airfield Driving Program and is the
   final authority for interpretation and enforcement of this program. Airfield Management
   trains and certifies Unit Airfield Driving Program Managers (UADPM). The UADPM will,
   in turn, manage their unit program, and train and certify unit personnel who have a
   requirement to drive on the airfield in accordance with (IAW) this instruction. Only the
   Airfield Manager (AFM), AAFM, or the Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC)
   Airfield Management Operations (NAMO) may sign the front of the USAFA Airfield
   Drivers License (AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency), and/or the USAFA Form 119,
   Airfield Driver Training and Certification, Section VII. The information contained within
   this instruction applies to both the USAFA Airfield and Bullseye Auxiliary Airfield.
   1.1.2. The goal of the airfield-driving program is to create a safe driving environment. Safe
   operation of motor vehicles on the airfield is absolutely essential to normal aircraft and
   maintenance operations. Motor vehicles present a clear and definite danger, both to aircraft
   and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste, and disregard for established safety standards are
   the primary sources of aircraft-vehicle collisions and/or incidents and personnel injury with
   motor vehicles on the airfield.
   1.1.3. The standards set in this instruction are to control all motor vehicles on the airfield.
   Only properly trained and certified personnel will drive on the Air Force Academy/Bullseye
   Airfields and will be knowledgeable of and comply with this instruction. All personnel
   operating a vehicle must be trained on local driving procedures and possess a valid AF Form
   483. This requirement applies to both military and civilian employees who are either
   assigned to, visiting, or on temporary duty to this base, and applies to drivers of military,
   commercial, and private motor vehicles.
   1.1.4. Personnel acting as an escort must be authorized and certified to drive on the airfield
   and be fully aware of associated responsibilities.
   1.1.5. The airfield and airfield controlled area is a place of official business. Activities on
   the airfield/airfield controlled area are generally limited to functions directly supporting
   aviation and/or parachute training programs. The flying of radio control aircraft, golfing,
   jogging for personal physical fitness, dirt biking, bicycling, public drinking, etc., are
   examples of recreational activities that are not allowed on the airfield or in the airfield
   controlled area. Personal pets are strictly prohibited in the airfield control area because they
   can become a hazard if they escape the control of their owner. Any unusual activities must
   be coordinated through and approved by the Airfield Manager.
1.2. Host Wing Commander Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. Designates personnel and agencies to support the Airfield Driving Program.

          1.11.2.8.1. AIRFIELD or FLIGHTLINE AUTHORIZED: Authorization given to an
          individual who requires access to CMA defined as any portion of the airfield
          requiring aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians to obtain control tower approval for
          access (via direct two-way radio contact with the control tower). Personnel who meet
          this requirement and or specifically need to either gain access onto or cross runways
          or perform their duties within the CMA will be issued this type of authorization.
 16                                                    USAFAI13-213 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


          Training documentation for this type license requires the USAFA Form 119, Section
          III, Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 be completed. Annual refresher training is
          required to maintain the authorization ( see paragraph 2.9.). This type of
          authorization is also valid at Bullseye.
          1.11.2.8.2. AIRFIELD NON-CMA ONLY: Authorization given to an individual
          who requires access to the ramps/aprons, but who does not qualify for the Airfield or
          Flightline Authorized license because they did not pass the color vision requirements
          or does not require full access. Training documentation for this type license requires
          the USAFA Form 119, Section III, Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 be completed.
          Annual refresher training is required to maintain the authorization (see paragraph
          2.9.).
          1.11.2.8.3. ACCESS ROAD ONLY: Authorization given to an individual who only
          requires driving out to and from the midfield area parking lot. Personnel issued
          ACCESS ROAD ONLY authorizations are not required to have radio
          communications with the control tower. Training for this type of authorization
          requires viewing of the local airfield driving video and receiving the ACCESS ROAD
          ONLY briefing/training. Trainees are not given a written test; they will be given an
          oral test by the UADPM or alternate to demonstrate proper Access Road procedures.
          Training documentation for this type license requires the USAFA Form 119, Section
          III, read the local Airfield Management Instructions as identified in Item 1 and
          complete the training identified in Item 2 (Classroom Training and video), the
          remainder of Section III will be N/A. Section II, Color Vision, is also N/A as drivers
          on the access road are not subject to tower light gun signals. Annual refresher
          training is NOT required.
          1.11.2.8.4. 306 FTG Form 12, TEMPORARY AIRFIELD DRIVING PERMIT:
          Authorization given to an individual whom only needs airfield access for a short
          period of time (example: contractors completing an airfield construction project).
          The valid period of the permit and the areas on the airfield it is valid for based on the
          contract. The valid period will not exceed the duration of the contract and will be
          limited to the specific haul routes and construction site for the project. The AFM or
          AAFM will specify the training requirements based on these routes and the
          construction site location. A Temporary permit may be issued for the USAFA
          Airfield or Bullseye Auxiliary Airfield.
          1.11.2.8.5. BULLSEYE: Authorization given to an individual who only needs to
          drive on the Bullseye Auxiliary Airfield. Training/documentation for this type of
          license requires the completion of the training on the USAFA Form 119, Section III,
          Items 1, 2 (including the video), 4 and 5. Bullseye is an uncontrolled airfield; no
          ATC, no CMA, and like the "Access Road Only" type license, the training is specific
          to what is required to operate on this unique airfield. Annual refresher training is
          required to maintain the authorization (see paragraph 2.9.).
1.12. Trainees.
   1.12.1. Provide feedback to trainer and/or UADPM on training received as required.
   1.12.2. Comply with requirements in this instruction.

   2.2.4. To the maximum extent possible, mobile radios should be installed in unit vehicles
   that routinely operate in the CMA. Handheld radios can be used as a backup. Units are
   responsible to ensure vehicle operators know how to operate and tune their radio to the
   correct frequency for communications with ATC.
2.3. Color Vision Testing.
   2.3.1. Personnel must have normal color vision IAW paragraph 1.9.
   2.3.2. See paragraph 1.9. for Color Vision screening and documentation procedures.
       2.3.2.1. Section II, Color Vision, is not applicable (N/A) for ―Access Road‖ and
       ―Bullseye‖ only. If a license is NON-CMA ONLY because the individual only needs
       access to a ramp area, the color vision test is not required.
       2.3.2.2. Individuals who fail color vision requirements must obtain waiver approval from
       the AAFM. Per AFI 13-213, waivers to color vision requirements can only be approved
       for non-radio controlled areas. A practical driving evaluation will be conducted. Results
       will be annotated on the waiver request letter. If an AFSC specifies the individual cannot
       be color blind, the waiver may be disapproved.

      Procedures Video. The presentation and video must include as a minimum all Crossing
      Procedures, Airfield Signs & Markings meanings and requirements, local trends, impact
      incursions could have on safety to both the individual and other personnel/aircraft, and
      consequences noted in paragraph 4.3.7.5.
USAFAI13-213 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             21


     2.10.1.2. One orientation walk/tour of crossing area, utilizing the proper crossing
     procedures. The object of this walk/tour is to demonstrate to the trainee the proper
     crossing techniques that must be utilized for crossing the runway(s) at midfield. During
     the walk/tour, the training will point out the various airfield signs/markings, their
     meanings, and how they relate to ensuring compliance with the crossing procedures.
     2.10.1.3. One tour of the Control Tower or Observation Deck is highly recommended.
     The object of this tour is to further explain runway-crossing procedures.
     2.10.1.4. One practical crossing evaluation. The object of this evaluation is for the
     trainee to demonstrate to the trainer the proper crossing techniques. Actual crossing
     techniques, application of rules, and knowledge of airfield signs and markings will be
     evaluated by the trainer.
     2.10.1.5. One written exam developed/administered by the trainees unit. The unit test
     must be approved by 306 FTG/SE. As a minimum, the exam will have at least 10
     questions, covering all Crossing Procedures, Airfield Signs and Markings meanings and
     requirements, impact incursions could have on safety both to the individual and other
     personnel/aircraft, and consequences noted in paragraph 4.3.7.5. Answering 8 of the 10
     questions (80%) is required. The written Pedestrian Crossing Test is a controlled item
     and must be protected as such from compromise.
     2.10.1.6. Document all the above training and testing requirements on 306 FTG Form
     14, Pedestrian Midfield Crossing Procedures Training. These forms will be maintained
     in a separate binder from the Drivers Training information. Like the Unit Airfield
     Drivers listing, a listing of individuals who are Pedestrian Midfield Crossing Procedures
     trained will be maintained and annual refresher training tracked. The UADPM or other
     individual appointed by the Unit Commander will maintain this binder and ensure annual
     refresher training is accomplished and documented on time.
     2.10.1.7. The Unit Commander will ensure refresher training is completed annually and
     documented on the bottom of the USAFA Form 119. Annual refresher training, as a

 22                                                     USAFAI13-213 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


                                           Chapter 3

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. Airfield Diagram.
   3.1.1. The following items are depicted on the Airfield Diagram.
      3.1.1.1. CMA for vehicles and pedestrians.
      3.1.1.2. Location of VFR Holding Positions (The USAFA Airfield is a Day VFR airfield
      and does not have instrument hold lines).
      3.1.1.3. Airfield access points.
      3.1.1.4. Controlled Area boundaries and entry points.
      3.1.1.5. Vehicle Traffic lanes/traffic flow.
      3.1.1.6. USAFA Airfield is a Day VFR airfield, thus does not have critical area
      boundaries for navigational aids.
      3.1.1.7. The actual Airfield Diagram is located at Attachment 2.
3.2. Controlled Movement Area Access and Emergency Removal Procedures.
   3.2.1. Controlled Movement Area.
      3.2.1.1. The CMA is defined as any runway (includes the runway overruns) or the grass
      areas within 100 feet of the runway. The runway/CMA begins at the runway hold lines
      and ends at the opposite side hold lines and as such the portions of Taxiway Juliet and
      Kilo inside the runway hold lines are part of/within the CMA. (Attachment 2)
          3.2.1.1.1. Depending on the reasoning for a runway or other area within the CMA
          being issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) closed, it may/may not be appropriate to
          maintain CMA status of the closed area. If the CMA status is also being removed to
          allow non-ATC approved/controlled operations, the NOTAM closing the area must
          also state the area involved is ―temporarily removed from the CMA.‖
          3.2.1.1.2. While the Sailplane Landing Area (SPLA) and Parachute Drop Zone (DZ)
          are not part of the CMA due to the unique nature of the sailplane and parachute
          operations on the USAFA airfield, access into these areas must be pre-coordinated.
          Prior to entering either area, prior coordination/permission must be obtained through
          AM to the 94 FTS and/or 98 FTS. Entering either area without the required prior
          coordination/permission creates a safety hazard for both the individual entering the
          area and/or 94th/98th personnel operating in the area; the AAFM may revoke the
          violator's Airfield Drivers license (AF Form 483) for entering without permission.
      3.2.1.2. Crossing the runway shall be kept to an absolute minimum. Do not cross the
      runway for convenience. The Midfield Access Road and Airfield Drive shall be used to
      travel to the opposite side of the airfield or to the midfield facilities unless time is of the
      essence.
USAFAI13-213 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                23


     3.2.1.3. The control tower is responsible for the control of vehicles crossing or operating
     on the runways. Academy Ground controls the CMA east of the Access Road and
     Skytrain controls the CMA west of the Access Road.
     3.2.1.4. Vehicles entering the CMA must have direct two-way radio contact with the
     tower or be escorted by a vehicle meeting this requirement. Vehicle operators shall
     remain in direct radio contact with the control tower while in the CMA. Vehicle
     operators escorted in CMA areas shall remain in contact with the escort vehicle operator
     and shall adhere to any escort instructions. After obtaining control tower approval for
     crossing, the escort vehicle will ensure all vehicles cross the runway. The escort vehicle
     will notify the control tower when all vehicles are beyond the established hold lines and
     off the runway.
         3.2.1.4.1. If driving on the airfield when tower/airfield is closed you must have a
         VHF radio and make appropriate radio notifications when entering or crossing the
         CMA via freq 124.150. The VHF requirements only apply between sunrise/sunset
         and the tower is closed. The only exception is when Snow Control is out on the
         airfield removing snow they are not required to have a VHF radio.
     3.2.1.5. Vehicles operating in any CMA area will have their emergency/warning flashers
     or a rotating beacon on to maximize their contrast to the landing environment. Special
     care must be taken during periods of restricted visibility when control tower visibility of
     the landing area is degraded.
     3.2.1.6. Vehicles requesting to cross the runway at a specific location shall do so
     expeditiously after receiving control tower approval. Vehicles anticipating travel along
     the length of the runway shall advise the control tower upon initial request.
     3.2.1.7. The Drop Zone Control Officer (DZCO) controls all vehicular traffic in the
     parachuting drop zone. Non-98 FTS vehicles must coordinate between AM and the
     DZCO prior to driving onto the drop zone. The coordinating agency is SKYTRAIN
     when parachuting is not operating.
  3.2.2. Disabled/Malfunction Vehicle Procedures.
     3.2.2.1. In the event of an accident or vehicle breakdown on the airfield, the control
     tower (Academy Ground or Skytrain) and AMOPS must be notified by the fastest means
     possible.
     3.2.2.2. If a vehicle malfunction prevents operation under its own power, individual(s)
     must make every attempt not to block a runway or taxiway. Try to move the vehicle
     beyond the wing tip clearance area.
     3.2.2.3. Leave the vehicle parking lights, emergency flashers and/or rotating beacon ON.
     3.2.2.4. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, notify the tower and AMOPS of
     your location and the nature of your problem. AMOPS will respond as appropriate to the
     situation.
         3.2.2.4.1. If a vehicle is not equipped with a radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
         attempts to get the attention of the taxiing aircraft or other vehicle operators by
         flashing your headlights and opening the vehicle hood.
 24                                                      USAFAI13-213 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


       3.2.2.5. Drivers will stay with the vehicle until the situation is resolved.
       3.2.2.6. Vehicles involved in accidents shall not be moved until released by 306
       FTG/SE, USAFA/SE, 306 OSS/OSAA, and 10 SFS.
   3.2.3. Radio Terminology/Phraseology and Discipline.
       3.2.3.1. Strict radio discipline is mandatory. No Citizen Band (CB) 10 codes, sarcastic,
       superfluous, obscene, or deceptive transmissions will be made. Only approved call signs
       as depicted in Attachment 10 will be used.
       3.2.3.2. The normal word authorizing a vehicle to operate near, enter, or cross any CMA/
       Runway is ―Proceed.‖ The word ―Proceed‖ may be accompanied with other words or
       phrases.
       3.2.3.3. The normal words to indicate disapproval for a vehicle to operate near, enter, or
       cross any CMA/Runway is ―Hold Short.‖ ―Hold Short‖ may be accompanied with other
       words or phrases. If ―Hold Short‖ is utilized, vehicle operators will NOT enter the
       CMA/Runway.
       3.2.3.4. Vehicle operators will read back/repeat all instructions to the tower prior to
       moving the vehicle. It is important vehicle operators listen carefully and repeat the
       instructions as they understood them. When reporting off of a CMA/Runway, the vehicle
       operator will ensure a response from the tower indicating tower understands the vehicle is
       off the CMA/Runway.
       3.2.3.5. If other vehicles will accompany the vehicle requesting access to the
       CMA/Runway, the vehicle operator must indicate this by including the word ―plus‖ and
       the number of escorted vehicles in the transmission. Example: ―Airfield2 plus 1.‖
       3.2.3.6. Normal communications to the control tower (Ground or Skytrain) will be
       initiated with whom you are calling and whom you are. Tower will reply in the same
       manner. The tower‘s reply indicates they are ready to hear your request. A normal
       request will be initiated with your call sign (who you are), your present location (where
       you are), and your request (what you want to do). Below is an example of how the
       communications between a vehicle (Airfield2) and the Tower (Ground) might go:

Table 3.1.1. Sample Calls.
Sample Call Description                                             Sample Call
Vehicle Operator‘s Initial Call to Tower           ―Ground, Airfield2‖
Tower‘s Initial Reply to the Vehicle               ―Airfield2, Ground‖
Vehicle Operator Makes Request                     ―Airfield2 on Taxiway Charlie, request to cross
                                                   Runway 34R to Taxiway Golf‖
Tower‘s Reply if Request is Disapproved            ―Airfield2, Hold Short of Runway 34R‖
Vehicle Operator Reads Back Instruction            ―Airfield2 holding short of Runway 34R‖
                                                 Or
Tower‘s Reply if Request is Approved               ―Airfield2, proceed across Runway 34R from
                                                   Taxiway Charlie to Taxiway Golf, report when
                                                   off the runway‖
Vehicle Operator Reads Back Instruction            ―Airfield2 proceeding across Runway 34R
USAFAI13-213 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  25


                                                  from Taxiway Charlie to Taxiway Golf, will
                                                  report off the runway”.
Once Across the Runway, Operator Reports          ―Ground, Airfield2 off Runway 34R at Taxiway
                                                  Golf‖
Tower‘s Reply to Vehicle Reporting Off            ―Airfield2, copy you are off Runway 34R at
                                                  Golf‖
       3.2.3.7. Some runway crossing approvals may be issued as ―without delay.‖ This means
       the tower has approved your operation using minimal time on the runway. If you are
       crossing the runway DO NOT STOP. If you expect to use more than minimal time on the
       runway or you are unable to proceed ―without delay,‖ hold short and advise the tower. If
       the tower approves you to cross the runway before you have made your request and you
       need access onto the runway instead of crossing, hold short and advise the tower.
       3.2.3.8. Under no circumstances shall a vehicle be driven onto the runway if there is any
       uncertainty concerning the approval of the request. Additionally, the words ―clear,‖
       ―cleared,‖ or ―clearance‖ must not be used by personnel or vehicles in the CMA or in
       communications with the tower.         These words are used strictly by ACT in
       communications with aircraft only.
3.3. Restricted/Controlled Areas.
   3.3.1. The USAFA airfield does not have a ―Restricted‖ area, but the Airfield is designated a
   ―Controlled‖ area and access is limited. Vehicle operators/personnel must be on the USAFA
   airfield controlled area access list and have a blue ―AF‖ on their proxy card to enter the
   airfield-controlled area as shown in Attachment 5 and 306 FTGI 31-101, Airfield Resource
   Protection. To operate a vehicle in the Controlled Area, an AF Form 483 is also required.
   An AF Form 483 alone does NOT grant access into the airfield controlled area.
   3.3.2. Personnel who work on the airfield on a routine basis are required to receive
   controlled area training and have the proper identification in their possession (Proxy Card
   with blue ―AF‖ on it). This requirement is processed through the Airfield Controlled Area
   Monitor who can be reached through Airfield Management. Procedure for entering/exiting
   the airfield gating system will be explained during this briefing.
   3.3.3. When approaching an entry control point of the controlled area, it is the responsibility
   of the operator to inspect and ensure the vehicle is not transporting personnel or materials
   which constitute a threat to the security of the resources. To prevent tailgating through the
   security gate, if a vehicle is behind you when entering a gate, drive through the gate and stop,
   wait for the gate to close and only then would you pull away from the gate.
   3.3.4. The USAFA Airfield does not normally have a Restricted area. However, 10 SFS
   may establish a Temporary Restricted Area to protect visiting aircraft to comply with Air
   Force Installation security requirements.
3.4. Vehicle Parking and Chocking.
   3.4.1. Vehicles will not be left unattended on runways, run-up pads, isolation pads, or
   taxiways. Vehicles within 100 feet of a runway or taxiway may be considered on the
   runway/taxiway. Exception: A gator or warning truck parked on/next to the beach.

     3.4.2.4. Parking brake set. Vehicles not equipped with an internal braking system will
     have chocks placed both in front of and behind one of the rear wheels. One chock will be
     placed between the tandem wheels of dual (tandem) axle vehicles. The only vehicles
     exempt from these requirements are emergency vehicles responding to an emergency.
     3.4.2.5. The doors will remain unlocked.
     3.4.2.6. At night, when parked unattended, the parking lights and/or emergency flashers
     shall be turned on.
  3.4.3. Only aircraft servicing support vehicles, which require the vehicle engine to operate as
  a power source for auxiliary components may be left unattended while the engine is running.
  The parking brake will be set, transmission placed in neutral (manual transmission) or park
  (automatic transmission) and the rear wheels chocked.
  3.4.4. Towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the driver completes
  hookup operations. The parking brake will be set.
     3.4.4.1. Drivers must shut off the vehicle, set the parking brake, and place the vehicle in
     park or reverse if they do not drive off with the aircraft ground equipment (AGE)
     equipment immediately following hookup.
  3.4.5. With the exception of emergency response vehicles that must remain in operation at
  the scene of the emergency, no other vehicles will be left with the engine running and
  unattended while on the airfield. Emergency response vehicles will have the parking brake
  set, have the transmission in neutral or park, and parking brake set when the driver‘s seat is
  not occupied.
  3.4.6. Vehicles will not be parked within 25 feet of any aircraft, except as authorized for
  operations such as unloading, loading, servicing, or towing.
     3.4.6.1. A spotter will be posted when a vehicle is backed towards an aircraft and pre-
     positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from striking the aircraft. The
     spotter will pre-brief the operator on the standard signals used.
  3.4.7. Park vehicles with the driver‘s side toward the aircraft. Never park a vehicle facing
  toward an aircraft.
     3.4.7.1. When parking vehicles near an aircraft, the desired location is in front of the
     aircraft, specifically in front of either wing. If it is necessary to park a vehicle at the side
     of aircraft, the vehicle must be parked in such a manner as to be visible to the aircrew in
     the cockpit.

3.14. Description and Location of Runway/Taxiway Marking and Signs.
   3.14.1. Airfield Markings (Standard).
      3.14.1.1. VFR Hold Short Line: Consist of two solid yellow lines adjacent to two dashed
      yellow lines and bordered in black as shown in Attachment 12, Figure A12.2.1. The
      dashed lines are located on the runway side of the marking. Hold Lines are painted
      across all taxiways leading to the runway and are located a minimum of 100 feet from the
      edge of the runway. Personnel, vehicles, and aircraft must contact the control tower and
      obtain permission prior to proceeding beyond the hold line (Figure A12.2.1.). NOTE:
      The VFR Hold Lines on Taxiway Juliet & Kilo are located just east of the Airmanship
      ramp (approximately 500 feet from the runway). This is a non-standard distance from the
      runway to protect the approach to the Sailplane Landing Area.
      3.14.1.2. Taxiway Centerline Marking: Solid yellow line used to designate the center of
      the taxiway as shown in Figure A12.3.1.
   3.14.2. Airfield Markings (Non-Standard).
      3.14.2.1. End of Runway (EOR) marking on Runways 16C/34C & 16R/34L are shown
      in Figure A12.4.1. Solid white line running across the runway near the midfield area of
      the runway. Aircraft, vehicles, and personnel between the EOR lines (within the
      sailplane staging area) are considered off the runway. The EOR lines are for use only by
      94 FTS aircraft, and give controllers and marshalling personnel a visible guide to ensure
      the designated runway surface is clear and that landing aircraft are at taxi speed and fully
      under control as they approach the sailplane staging area.
      3.14.2.2. ATC aircraft separation distance markings. Solid white line running across the
      runway, 1000 feet and 1500 feet from the approach ends as shown in Figure A12.4.1.
      Utilized by ATC to judge/ensure aircraft separation distance.
      3.14.2.3. Runway center point marking. Solid white line running across the runway at its
      center point as shown in Figure A12.5.1.
      3.14.2.4. Midfield cross walk markings; comprised of the pedestrian crossing box,
      warning markings, and crossing lane markings as shown in Figure A12.5.1. The crossing

      boxes are yellow boxes with diagonal yellow stripes located on each side of the center
      runway at midfield. The warning markings are red and white plain English writing
      providing hazard warnings & guidance for personnel wanting to cross the center runway.
      The crossing lane markings are two parallel yellow lines running between the crossing
      boxes (the yellow lines break on the center runway) providing a border where all
      pedestrian crossings take place. See paragraphs 3.19.1. and 3.19.2. for crossing
      procedures.
      3.14.2.5. Tow plane positioning lines. A set of five solid white lines running across the
      runway in the midfield area of the runway as shown in Figure A12.8.1. Utilized by tow
      plane pilots to correctly position their aircraft for sailplane hook-up.
      3.14.2.6. Hold line at midfield between the center & west runway. Consist of two solid
      yellow lines on each side of one dashed yellow line as shown in Figure A12.7.1. This is
      a two sided/ dual-purpose hold line. If you are on the center runway, you must hold short
      of the west runway at this hold line. If you are on the west runway, you must hold short
      of the center runway at this hold line. Personnel, vehicle, and aircraft must contact the
      control tower and obtain permission prior to proceeding beyond the hold line.
   3.14.3. Airfield Signs.
      3.14.3.1. Mandatory Signs: Red background with white inscription. Airfield mandatory
      signs are located adjacent to runway and instrument hold lines as shown in Figure
      A12.8.1. You must have permission from the control tower to go past this sign and
      associated lines.
      3.14.3.2. Informational Signs.
          3.14.3.2.1. Taxiway Direction Sign. Yellow background with black inscription and
          arrow. Identifies direction and designation of an intersecting taxiway as shown in the
          insert of Figure A12.8.1.
          3.14.3.2.2. Taxiway/Runway Location: Black background with yellow inscription.
          Identifies taxiway or runway on which the vehicle/aircraft is located as shown in
          Figure A12.8.1.
          3.14.3.2.3. Runway threshold markings consist of a 3-foot white bar running across
          the full width of the runway starting 6 inches in from the overrun chevron. This
          white bar indicates the beginning of the full strength pavement.
3.15. Control Tower and/or Vehicle Radio Problem Areas and Visual Blind Spots.
   3.15.1. Airfield vehicle operators must be aware of visual blind spots. There are no radio
   blind spots on the airfield, but should the radio fail, follow procedures detailed in paragraph

   Management for identification and processing through 306 FTG/SE.
3.17. Lateral Distance Requirements for Mobile Obstacles on Runways/Taxiways/Aprons.
   3.17.1. Runways.
      3.17.1.1. Runway Lateral Clearance Zone extends 500 feet on each side of the runway
      centerline and must be clear of fixed or mobile objects. Fixed obstacles include
      manmade or natural features such as buildings, trees, rocks, terrain irregularities, and any
      other features constituting a possible hazard to moving aircraft. Mobile obstacles include
      parked aircraft, parked or moving vehicles, railroad cars, and similar equipment. Taxiing
      aircraft, emergency vehicles, and authorized maintenance vehicles are not considered an
      obstacle.
      3.17.1.2. Runway Clear Zones are areas on the ground, located at the ends of each
      runway that possess a high potential for accidents and their use is restricted to be
      compatible with aircraft operations. The Clear Zone is 1,000 feet wide centered on the
      extended runway centerline and 3,000 feet in length measured along the extended runway
      centerline beginning at the runway end. The first 1,000 feet of the Clear Zone is the
      graded area and is to be cleared and grubbed of stumps and free of abrupt surface
      irregularities, ditches, and ponding areas; the graded portion of the Clear Zone must be
      maintained.
   3.17.1.3. Ramps. Clearance from the apron/ramp edge to fixed or mobile obstacles is
   variable, based on the wingspan of the aircraft using the ramp. Compute the distance by
   multiplying 0.5 times the wingspan of the most demanding aircraft that will use the apron,
   and add the appropriate wing tip clearance required of an aircraft on interior or Secondary
   Peripheral Taxi lanes and or Primary Peripheral Taxi lanes. Then subtract the distance from
 32                                                   USAFAI13-213 15 SEPTEMBER 2011

      the performance of assigned duties. Additionally, the 94 FTS may operate a gator on the
      west side of the airfield when soaring operations are in progress. Golf-type carts and/or
      gators will follow all rules established for general and special purpose vehicles and will
      be equipped with forward and rear lamps if operated at night. Operators of these type
      vehicles must have a valid USAFA issued AF Form 483.
      3.18.1.6. During special events (ceremonies) at the midfield facilities, the 306 OSS/CC
      may open the Access Road for special guests in POVs who will be attending these events.
      The 306 OSS/CC will take into consideration airfield flight activities prior to approving
      this procedure. This procedure will be coordinated with AM and Academy Ground. It is
      highly recommended that Taxiway G at the intersection of the access road be swept
      following the completion of these events when all guests have departed the area. POVs
      on the midfield access road do not require a POV pass.
   3.18.2. Unauthorized Vehicles: Motorcycles, bicycles, mopeds, and two-wheeled scooters

   when soaring operations are active. Pedestrians wishing to cross the center runway will
   stand in the crossing box, facing the control tower Crossing Light System as shown in
   Attachment 13, Figure A13.1.1. Controllers will use the Crossing Light System to authorize
   personnel in the crossing box to proceed across the center runway by changing the Crossing
   Light from red to green. Pedestrians in the crossing box must hold short of the center runway
   as long as the Crossing Light is red. When the Crossing Light System is inoperative, the
   Skytrain public address system (Giant Voice) may be used. The red crossing light will be on
   at all times when the airfield is open, unless tower is specifically authorizing someone to
   cross the center runway.

     not required for this type suspension (unless deemed appropriate by the AAFM).
         4.3.7.3.1. While the SPLA and Parachute DZ are not part of the CMA due to the
         unique nature of the sailplane and parachute operations on the USAFA airfield,
         access into these areas is restricted.      Prior to entering either area, prior
         coordination/permission must be obtained through AM to the 94 FTS and/or 98 FTS.
         Entering either area without the required prior coordination/ permission creates a
         safety hazard for both the individual entering the area and/or 94 FTS/ 98 FTS
         personnel operating in the area; the AAFM may revoke the violators Airfield Drivers
         License (AF Form 483) for entering without permission.
     4.3.7.4. Drivers who commit three violations within a 12-month period will lose their
     driving privileges for a minimum of 6 months. After serving the 6 month revocation, the
     driver must be re-certified/trained (as if a new driver) to drive on the airfield.
     4.3.7.5. Pedestrians committing an airfield procedural infraction/violation, runway
     intrusion, or CMAV will automatically have their airfield driving privileges (if they have
     an AF Form 483) suspended pending an investigation of the incident. Additionally, these
     individuals will not be allowed to return to the airfield for any reason until they have been
     interviewed/briefed by the responsible unit CC, or DO if the CC is not available and
     retraining/recertification is completed. This interview/briefing may not be delegated
     below the DO level. The CC/DO interview/ briefing and retraining/recertification must
     be documented in writing. Forward a copy of the documentation to the AAFM at 306
     OSS/OSAA to be filed with the other CMAV paperwork.
     4.3.7.6. Any further action is at the discretion of the unit commander.
  4.3.8. The AAFM will maintain a record of driving violations for the current year plus the
  previous calendar year. Records will include a copy of the AF Form 651 or AF Form 457,
  the driver‘s written statement, a copy of the 306 FTG/SE AFSAS or report of incident, and
  the written notification to the violator‘s commander. If it was a pedestrian violation, the
  records will also include the violator‘s unit CC/DO interview/briefing and
  retraining/recertification documentation.
  4.3.9. Airfield CMA or procedures violations will be briefed quarterly to the AOB.
