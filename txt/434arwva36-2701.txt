                                        Equal Opportunity
                 “Committed to Fairness and Equality for All”


  Our goal is to improve mission effectiveness by promoting an environment free from
 personal, social or institutional barriers that prevents Air Force members from rising to
  the highest level of responsibility possible based on their individual merit, fitness and
                                          capability.

  The Equal Opportunity Informal and Formal Complaint processes are directed by AFI
 37-2706 Chapters 3 (military) & 4 (civilian). Each chapter provides procedures for filing
                          a complaint and complainant rights.
