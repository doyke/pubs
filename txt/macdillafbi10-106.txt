SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises the accessibility and releasability statements. A margin bar (|)
indicates new or revised material since the previous edition.
1. General. The assignment of the 6 AMW, the United States Special Operations Command,
the United States Central Command, and other agencies around base make servicing transient
aircraft a vital function of MacDill Air Force Base. Every effort should be made to furnish
aircrews with services and necessary facilities they require during their stay at this base. To
measure our effectiveness, each transient aircraft commander will be encouraged to rate the
services furnished during their stay.

2. Procedures.
     2.1. Airfield Management Operations will ensure each transient aircrew commander is aware
     of MACDILL AFB IMT 14 prior to departing the base. This will normally be accomplished
     upon submission of his/her flight plans, but MACDILL AFB IMT 14 will also be available in
     the flight planning area.
     2.2. The Airfield Manager (6 OSS/OSAA) will:
        2.2.1. Make a copy of the survey where ‘poor’ ratings are indicated and forward this to
        the Commander (6 OSS/ CC). The 6 OSS/CC will route the MACDILL AFB IMT 14 to
        the agency of primary interest through the applicable group commander(s).
        2.2.2. Maintain a file of MACDILL AFB IMTs 14 where ‘poor’ ratings were given and
        the corrective action taken by the base agency.
     2.3. Staff agencies/units receiving a MACDILL AFB IMT 14 from the 6 OSS/CC will:
        2.3.1. Take immediate action to correct unfavorable comments or justify current
        procedures.
        2.3.2. Reply by endorsement to the 6 OSS/CC through the Commander (6 AMW/CC)
        and the 6th Operations Group Commander within 10 duty days, describing what actions
        have been taken in lieu of the comments made by the transient aircrews.
        2.3.3. The 6 OSS/CC will forward the completed survey to the 6 OSS/OSAA for filing
        and any additional actions required.
