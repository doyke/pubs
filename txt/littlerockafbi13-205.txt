SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision updates
general wording and offices of responsibility. Due to the new parking plan revamp the parking
spots resized within the restricted area. Major changes include: ADD - 1.1.10. Row M spot 1
should remain open during normal operations to ensure emergency towing capability out of
hangar 250 spots 4-6 and hangar 255 north and south to the main apron. Change Note to read,
“Additional Maximum Credible Event restrictions apply to certain munitions within HC/D 1.2.1
and 1.2.3. Coordinate with Weapons Safety”. ADD: Airfield Parking Map. 1.1.1. 19th Airlift
Wing and 314th Airlift Wing aircraft will normally be parked on rows B through T. The
maintenance operations center (MOC) is responsible for assigning aircraft parking locations for

19AW and 314AW aircraft on these rows. 1.1.2. 189th Airlift Wing aircraft will normally be
parked on rows U through W. The 189th MOC is responsible for assigning parking locations for
189AW assigned aircraft on these rows. 1.1.3. Transient aircraft will normally be parked on rows
Y and Z. Parking of transient aircraft will be determined by Airfield Management Operations in
coordination with transient alert. NOTE: Rows X-Z are established to accommodate a variety of
large, wide-body transient aircraft. To maximize parking flexibility regardless of the mix of
aircraft, parking row Z taxi-lines have been omitted. When using this row, aircraft must use
extreme caution and respond to marshaler’s instructions while parking. 1.1.4. X and Y row are
“Big Bird”. X and Y row are used for formation re-marshaling and other formation operations;
however, only X row provides secure parking for priority level 3 and large frame transient
aircraft. Use of this area for any other purpose requires coordination with Airfield Management
Operations. Should X and Y row run out of available space, Z row can be used for formation re-
marshaling and other formation operations after coordination with Airfield Management.1.1.5.
There is no Q row. Row Q was omitted and replaced with a 30ft wide lane designated as the
FIRE LANE for emergency vehicle response. 1.1.6. The Christmas Tree apron is located at the
far east end of the airfield and contains eight parking stubs which are used for a variety of
reasons. The Christmas Tree is restricted to C-17 and smaller aircraft (Note: Stub 1 is normally
used for equipment storage). 1.1.7. Only one aircraft per parking spot in the Christmas Tree.

6. Support For Non-HUREVAC Explosives Loaded Combat Airlift.
   6.1. With the exception of parking locations for HUREVAC operations, Little Rock Air
   Force Base is not sited for explosives loaded combat aircraft.
      6.1.1. Situations may arise when parking support for explosives loaded combat aircraft is
      required (i.e. in-flight emergency, weather divert, etc.) In these cases, the Airfield
      Manager will contact the Wing Weapons Safety Manager or Weapons Safety stand-by for
      parking coordination. In the event communication cannot be made, park explosives
      loaded combat aircraft in the safest manner possible, utilizing the greatest distance from
      other parked aircraft, populated facilities, transportation routes, and base boundaries.
      6.1.2. Little Rock Air Force Base will not be considered a “stopover” site for normal
      transiting explosive loaded combat aircraft or in other planning processes. Parking of

        LRAFBI 91-107.
7. Airfield Restrictions/Coordination.
     7.1. Recurring apron pavement repairs/restriping often requires parking spot and/or row
     closure(s) and the temporary relocation of aircraft. The following procedures apply:
        7.1.1. Airfield Management will:
            7.1.1.1. Per AFI 13-204V3, impose restrictions and/or close any part of the airfield to
            all traffic when an unsafe condition exists such as pavement deficiency/failure.
            7.1.1.2. Coordinate aircraft relocation requirements with MOC NLT 72 hours prior to
            projected closure. EXCEPTION: Severe pavement failure may require immediate
            closure for emergency repair.         To the maximum extent possible, Airfield
            Management will assist MOC in determining adequate parking locations for displaced
            aircraft.
            7.1.1.3. Provide alternate parking locations for number of displaced aircraft only if
            space is unavailable on the main parking apron.
        7.1.2. MOC will:
            7.1.2.1. Make every effort to support the requested work.
            7.1.2.2. Provided space is available, make all arrangements to relocate aircraft. If
            space on the main parking apron is not available, MOC will coordinate with Airfield
            Management for alternate parking locations adequate for the number of displaced
            aircraft.
            7.1.2.3. Determine aircraft parking availability and make the              appropriate
            coordination (to include SFS for any additional security requirements).
            7.1.2.4. Coordinate with maintenance units to relocate aircraft.
            7.1.2.5. Inform Airfield Management whether the requested parking areas will or will
            not be available NLT the day prior to scheduled work.
8. Deviations.
     8.1. Deviations from assignments established by this instruction will be in coordination with
     the 19th MOC Senior and the Airfield Manager.
