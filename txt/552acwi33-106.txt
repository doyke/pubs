SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes have been made to update office symbols and AFI references. Historical information
was removed from the OGV SME handbook review procedures (previous attachment 2).

The 552 OG/OGV Subject Matter Expert (SME) is the individual responsible for questions
regarding their positional handbook.
1. Policy. The processing of 552 ACWPHB orders and proposed changes, coupled with the
distribution of E-3 software manuals, are mission essential. All changes to 552 ACWPHBs must
be approved by 552 OG/OGV Subject Matter Experts (SME) prior to publication and operational
use of E-3 software. New E-3 operational software versions will only be released in conjunction
with 552 OG/OGV approved documentation that is published in the 552 ACWPHBs. Software
test and evaluation sorties supervised by the 552 OSS/OSR (Operations Group Requirements)
and approved by the 552 OG/CC are exempt from this documentation requirement. E-3
operational software release dates and documentation milestones must be coordinated through
552 OG/OGV, 552 ACNS/SCXP, 552 ACNS/SCXC (Configuration Management Section), 552
OSS/OSR, and 552 OSS/OST (Combat Training Flight) and are coordinated at the monthly
Software Delivery Working Group (SDWG) meetings. 552 OG/OGV will notify 552
OSS/OSTP (Media Production) of the software release date. The goal is to ensure 552
ACWPHBs are in place and ready two weeks prior to the scheduled software/documentation
change release date. This is vital to ensure version-associated training and procedures are in-
place prior to the software release date.
     1.1. Initiating Software Changes. 552 OSS/OSR is the OPR for initiating and coordinating
     most Computer Software Change Requests (CSCRs). System Design Requests (SDRs),
     Program Error Reports (PERs), Database Changes Request (DBCRs), and Document Error
     Reports (DERs) are possible source documents for software and documentation corrections.
     While anyone can initiate an SDR, Program Incident Report (PIR), or DER, only software
     programmers can initiate a PER. These documents and the PIRs form the source documents
     for the CSCR process. 552 OSS/OSR and 552 ACNS/ SCXP are the functional agencies for
     the monitoring and tracking of the software development process. OGV will be kept
     informed of software development through the Software Delivery Working Group.
     1.2. Software Project Management. The 552 Air Control Networks Squadron (ACNS)
     receives a 552 ACW approved Requirements Priority list which is used to start a new
     software project. The project then continues through the software development process until
     accepted at the version/change release date, by the user.
     1.3. Project Deliverables. As the project nears the software version/change release date,
     552 ACNS/SCXC will provide 552 OG/OGV Red Line copies of all documents that will
     change the 552 ACWPHBs.
        1.3.1. The 552 ACW Form 7, Document Error Report (DER), reporting process is a
        continuous function. 552 ACNS/SCXC receives, assigns tracking numbers, and forwards
        DERs to the 552 OG/OGV for review and approval. DERs are normally banked and
        included in a software version/change release. Any DERs not approved 16 weeks prior
        to version/change release date will be prioritized and banked for subsequent software
        version/change release.
552ACWI33-106 26 MAY 2011                                                                     3


       1.3.2. Project change documents (i.e., DERs and Red Line Copy changes) will be
       delivered to the 552 OG/OGV by 552 ACNS/SCXC NLT 12 weeks prior to software
       version/change evaluation release date. 552 ACWPHB SMEs will produce a White Line
       version of their volume and provide them to 552 OSS/OSTP to start the documentation
       change and production process. This does not preclude addition of minor revisions
       identified during software evaluation and testing.
2. Duties and Responsibilities.
   2.1. 552 OG/OGV. 552 OG/OGV is the single focal point for the operational review and
   approval of all DERs, and new documentation associated with new software version/change
   release generated by commercial or organic sources. 552 OG/OGV 552 ACWPHB volume
   SMEs will:
       2.1.1. Process all DERs for 552 ACWPHBs received from 552 ANCS/SCXC IAW
       Attachment 2 of this instruction. DERs not approved 16 weeks prior to software
       version/change release date will not normally be approved for inclusion in the current
       software version/change release and should be limited to DERs that are administrative in
       nature (i.e., typos or format errors). SMEs will maintain a Red Line copy of 552
       ACWPHB for each E-3 baseline specific software.
       2.1.2. Process software project approved 552 ACWPHB annotated Red Line copies of
       documents received from 552 ACNS/SCXC 12 weeks prior to the software
       version/change evaluation release date.
       2.1.3. Prepare Red Line page changes for 552 ACWPHBs IAW Attachment 2 of this
       instruction, and incorporate these changes into the SMEs appropriate volume for 552
       OSS/OSTP as soon as practical, but NLT 10 weeks prior to software version/change
       evaluation release date.
       2.1.4. Review preliminary change document (preliminary White Line copy) and return to
       the      552 OSS/OSTP within two full duty days of receipt.
       2.1.5. Review and post final White Line Copy. Annotate correction(s) to the
       basic/change and conduct an ―A‖ page check (checking each page’s change number with
       the List of Effective Pages).
       2.1.6. A software change is not required for the document change process to be initiated.
       New equipment or excessive DERs are some reasons for a document change. A change
       can be initiated at the discretion of OGV.
   2.2. 552 ACNS/SCXC. The single focal point for the receipt, assignment of tracking
   numbers, processing, and technical review of all DERs submitted IAW 552 ACWI 63-101,
   E-3 Operations data Software Requirements and Enhancements. The 552 ACNS/SCXC
   will:
       2.2.1. Process all DERs for 552 ACWPHBs through OGV. Any DERs not approved 16
       weeks prior to software version/change release date will be prioritized and banked for
       subsequent software version/change releases.
       2.2.2. Process software project approved 552 ACWPHB series change documents (i.e.,
       DERs, PERs, SDRs, etc.), and provide OGV Red Line copies with all changes NLT 12
       weeks prior to the software version/change evaluation release date.
 4                                                            552ACWI33-106 26 MAY 2011


        2.2.3. Prepare Red Line page changes for 552 ACWPHBs.
     2.3. 552 OSS/OSTP will:
        2.3.1. Review changes and revisions requested by 552 OG/OGV and, if necessary,
        request overtime/compensatory time for editors through the 552 OG/CC in order to
        accomplish the preliminary white-line changes in a timely manner for OGV review.
        2.3.2. Prepare preliminary White Line for OGV review and approval NLT six weeks
        prior to software version/change release date. Provide copies of the preliminary White
        Line to the     552 OSS/OST for use in training development/changes prior to software
        release. Prepare White Line copy of changes for review by the 552 ACW Foreign
        Disclosure Officer.
        2.3.3. Prepare one final White Line copy (including change instructions) for 552
        OG/OGV review and final approval. OGV will coordinate with 552 ACNS/SCXC and
        Delaware Resource Group if required.
        2.3.4. Prepare reproduction master for print.
        2.3.5. Prepare PDF version files of change packages for inclusion on the OGV web page.
        After each individual change package has been prepared, OSTP will then merge the PDF
        change packages into the ―basic through‖ package to facilitate OGV reprints.
     2.4. 552 OG/OGV TODO will:
        2.4.1. Receive and disseminate all DERs for 552 ACWPHBs to each volume SME.
        2.4.2. Coordinate with 552 OSS/OSTP for delivery of preliminary White Line, final
        White Line, and validated basic/change copies of all 552 ACWPHB software manuals
        and associated volumes.
        2.4.3. Provide Delaware Resource Group two final White Line copies IAW with contract
        requirements.
        2.4.4. Receive and disseminate printed 552 ACWPHBs from the printer.
        2.4.5. Maintain one master copy of each 552 ACWPHB volume for reprint.
        2.4.6. Process all orders, pick-up basic/change, and distribute all 552 ACWPHB software
        manuals to the following organizations: 552 ACNS/SCXC, Contractors, 960 AACS, 961
        AACS, 962 AACS, 963 AACS, 964 AACS, 965 AACS, 966 AACS, 970 AACS, and the
        552 TRS.
        2.4.7. OGV TODO will coordinate among OGV SMEs for the exact number of
        basic/changes for each of the 552 ACWPHBs, by volume, to be printed. Initiate print
        request and forward basic/change to the printers.
3. Ordering and Distribution.
     3.1. To order 552 ACWPHBs, all users will submit a letter of justification to the 552
     OG/OGV TODO stating which volume(s) is/are needed, the number of each volume
     required, and provide the name and address of their Flight Manual Control Officer (FMCO).
     The 552 OG/OGV TODO will process all requests and distribute the 552 ACWPHBs and
552ACWI33-106 26 MAY 2011                                                                 5


   changes to the unit FMCO through the flight manuals distribution system. For the 552 ACG,
   the 552 ACNS/SCXC office provides the FMCO function.
   3.2. For Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), the 552 ACWPHBs basic/change will be
   mailed first class or registered mail to the requester.
   3.3. New accounts require Chief, 552 OG/OGV approval before they can be added to the
   official distribution list.
4. Submitting Changes. All documentation changes affecting the contents of the
552 ACWPHB software manuals result from two sources, simple user reported documentation
errors, or from 552 ACNS/SCF validated CSCRs, which prompt documentation changes.
Documentation errors will be submitted to the 552 ACNS/SCXC using the 552 ACW Form 7,
Document Error Report, IAW 552 ACWI 63-101. Changes promted by CSCR’s will be
documented by annotated Red Line copies of the 552 ACWPHB.
5. Posting Changes. The 552 ACWPHBs are considered specialized publications. The current
governing regulation is AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
6. List of Effective Pages (LEP) checks. LEP checks are a comparison of the page and change
numbers on each page of a positional handbook with the data on the LEP (or "A" Page). LEP
checks are MANDATORY when changes and revisions to paper positional handbooks are
posted.

                     OGV SME HANDBOOK REVIEW PROCEDURES

A2.1. The Document Error Report (DER) monitor will receive DERs continually and provide
them to the respective SME. These DERs will be maintained with the respective red line
positional. All positional handbooks must be checked to verify if a DER is approved.
Standardization of all common areas in the positional handbooks is the responsibility of the
Surveillance SMEs in OGV. One of these individuals will be appointed the 552 ACWPHB
Standardization Monitor.
     A2.1.1. Standardization of Positional Handbooks: Once the OGV SME has approved a
     DER, the OGV DER monitor who is the lead SME for coordinating the Red Line, White
     Line, printing and distributing processes will take this document to the standardization
     monitor for review. Corrections will be made to the DER if a handbook was overlooked;
     return to the DER monitor for coordination.
     A2.1.2. Documentation for each switch action/tabular display is identical for all positionals
     with that function. Each mission crew section has its own specialized volume and is
     organized with the sections:
Section I – General Information. Standardized across most positionals. Exceptions: CDMT,
CT, and ART.
Section II – Switch Actions. The framework for this section is identical for most positionals.
What varies is the content, based on the needs of that specific crew position.
Section III – References. The organizational framework for this section is similar to section 2,
and is the same for most positionals. Chapter 1 – Attentions, Alarms, Alerts, and Messages,
Chapter 2 - Positional Description, and Chapter 3 – Start Over.
Section IV- Notes

 Attachment 1 – Glossary.


A2.2. Establishing the Baseline for the Red Line Copy (16 weeks prior to software
version/change release). IAW para 1.6.1 and 2.1.1, any DERs not approved 16 weeks prior to
software version/change release date will be prioritized and banked for subsequent software
version/change. In other words, 552 ACNS/SCXC delivers a red line copy with all DERs they
understand will be included in the upcoming software/change version change release (para 2.1.1
and 2.1.2). Each OGV SME (para 2.1.1, 2.1.2 and 2.1.3) must review and cross check these
DERs against their current copy. Ideally, all DERs will be included in the 552 ACNS/SCXC
copy. If they are not, then the SME must add the missing DERs to the list and report the
differences to the DER monitor. The DER monitor will cross check with the OGV
standardization monitor to ensure all positionals have the version and revision baseline. Once
finalized, the 552 ACNS/SCXC is notified and the final red line is produced. These tabbed red
line volumes are then forwarded to OSTP for production.
A2.3. Red Line Review Process (16 weeks, but NLT 12 weeks prior to software version/change
release). The tendency for OGV is to work in isolation as individual SMEs and to consume the
552ACWI33-106 26 MAY 2011                                                                      9


vast majority of this time. These OGV copies must be standardized and sent to OSTP in one
large group. A change by one SME can affect every volume. While the DER monitor
historically does the coordination with each SME and OSTP, the OGV standardization monitor
must approve all changes to the common areas of the handbooks before any volumes are sent to
OSTP. Therefore the OGV SMEs must come together as a priority to finalize the red lines for
delivery to OSTP. This must be scheduled as a major OGV event at the start of the red line
process.
A2.4. Preliminary White Line Copy (10 weeks but NLT 6 weeks prior to software
version/change release). IAW para 2.1.4 and 2.4.2, OSTP will produce the initial white line
copies and return them to OGV for review. The SMEs must review every facet of the change.
Specifically, the A-page must be fully validated each time the change is reviewed. This is more
than a content check to validate the DERs changes were made. It is normal for the white line to
move back and forth between OGV and OSTP.
A2.5. Final White Line (generally a 2 week process). The final step of the software
version/change release process is to create a new red line copy for the new software version
change release. At the start of the process, ACG and OGV collectively close the DER process
and agree to a red line. The red line is prepared by OGV and submitted to OSTP. IAW para
2.3.3, the preliminary white line version is produced and validated by the OGV SMEs, and the
OGV standardization monitor. Once the OGV SME accepts the final version, (para 2.1.5 and
2.4.2) that book, posted with the upcoming change, becomes the new red line. Exception: a
complete revision. IAW para 2.4.3, the DER monitor delivers the two white line copies to
Delaware Resource Group to ensure the IQT faculty has the documentation and the necessary
training time for the upcoming software version/change release.
A2.6. Once a final white line is approved, OGV prepares the documents and submits them to the
printer for production (para 2.4.7). IAW para 2.4.4 and 2.4.6, the OGV TODO will receive these
documents and prepare them for distribution. The software version change/revision delivered by
the printer must be validated prior to making the distribution. The OGV SMEs should post a
copy of the positional in the TODO office to validate the quality of the printers work. Once this
is done, the TODO must correct the discrepancy, by working with OSTP. If there are no errors,
store the print masters for future use and proceed with the distribution, via the FCIF process.
The software version/change documentation must precede the software version/change release
delivery date.
