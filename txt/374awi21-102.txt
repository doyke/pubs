This instruction establishes specific guidelines for 374th Airlift Wing (374 AW) C-130 aircraft
configured with chaff/flare munitions for Aircraft Defensive Systems (ADS). These systems use
Hazard Class/Division 1.3. and 1.4., explosives, which require special handling and coordination.
The following procedures must be accomplished to ensure explosives are handled safely and
expeditiously while on Yokota Air Base (AB) or at a deployed location. All personnel working
around explosives-loaded aircraft must be trained and familiar with the hazards involved. They
will also ensure explosives operations expose a minimum number of people to minimum amount
of explosives for a minimum amount of time. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance (IAW) Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of IAW the Air Force Records
