AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                     39


  review. The audit helps identify errors, validate AOs that change the ASC match the
  Aviation Service Audit Worksheet, and confirm the OFDA total is correct. The following
  guidelines help to audit and can help to verify or reconstruct information contained in
  ARMS. (T-1)
     3.14.1.1. Rated Officer Computation. The Aviation Service Audit Worksheet computes
     OFDA months using information from the AO history published after the ACIA of 1974.
     (T-1)
        3.14.1.1.1. Audit each change of ASC against AOs to ensure proper OFDA credit.
        (T-1)

            1A8X2). (T-1)
     3.14.1.2. CEA and ABM Computation. Prior to 1 Oct 99, CEAs, and ABMs were
     classified as nonrated aircrew members and OFDA months were not tracked. The NDAA
     of FY00 established the CEFIP Program and classified certain enlisted AFSCs as CEAs.
     An AF Form 142 was created for all CEAs and ABMs annotating each nonrated ASC
     date and the number of active/inactive months of flying accrued prior to 1 October 1999.
     This form was used to establish the ASD, marked as a permanent record, and filed in the
     FRF. (T-1)
        3.14.1.2.1. For rated officers with Other US Military Service time, the inclusive dates
        of prior service is entered on the first line, the number of months of OFDA (active
        and inactive) for that time period, and the branch of service is annotated in the left
        margin (e.g., Army, Navy). The next line entry is the appropriate ASC based on the
        ASD. (T-1)
        3.14.1.2.2. Do not publish AOs prior to commission or enlistment in the Air Force.
        HARM personnel will update prior service active/inactive periods in ARMS to ensure
        correct OFDA calculation without publishing AOs for those prior service periods.
        Use the member’s ARB application to document these periods. If missing, the
        member must provide official prior service documentation. HARM personnel can
        retrieve sister service publications from the official web page (if needed) to validate
        official source documentation (example: BUPERS-Navy, Army Regulations-
        ARMY). (T-1)
     3.14.1.3. Maintain the ARMS-generated ASAW in the FRF after an individual passes the
     18 (rated) or 20 (CEA) year gate. Do not update the form after an individual has passed
     the 18-year aviation service gate (Rated) or 20-year aviation service gate (CEA). (T-1)
     3.14.1.4. Ensure all rated officers and CEA flight records contain a clear audit trail
     establishing the initial OFDA and subsequently accrued OFDA months. (T-1)
 40                                                                  AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014

Notes:
1. When records are transferred and TDY is 90 days or longer, item 1, Table 4.1 may apply.
2. If records are not electronically transferred, the SARM will forward a copy of current IDS, FHR,
ITS, and Flight/Jump Checklist to the TDY HARM office. The IDS is used to validate member’s
physical availability code (DNIF status), aviation service code, flight physical, and physiological
accomplishment/due dates. The FHR reflects member’s current experience level. The ITS reflects
members current training requirements/accomplishments. Flight/Jump TDY Worksheet validates
Go/No-Go requirements were verified by the member and member’s SARM for the TDY period.
The TDY SARM can compare the ARMS products against the Flight/Jump TDY Worksheet to
validate the member is qualified through TDY period. SARMs will still need to monitor DNIF
status at TDY location.

Notes:
1. Use of code “A” enables ARMS to calculate the Flight Physical Due Date IAW AFI 44-170.
2. Use of code “F” is primarily utilized for undergraduate flying training members assigned FSC
U. This code allows users to enter the Flight Physical Due Date based on the “Date Medical
Clearance Expires” block of the AF Form 1042 and provides an extended time to accomplish
initial/advanced (pipeline) training. Use of the code “F” is also utilized when the Flight Physical
Due Date does not match the “Date Medical Clearance Expires” on AF Form 1042 when using
Flight Physical Status Code “A”.

                    AERONAUTICAL ORDERS ADMINISTRATION

4.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines duties for preparing, processing, and general instructions
for aeronautical orders.
4.2. Waiver Criteria. This chapter includes (T-1) and (T-2).
4.3. Aeronautical Orders (AO).
   4.3.1. AOs validate individual qualification for aviation and parachutist service; to authorize
   and direct individual performance of duty that involves frequent and regular participation in
   aerial flight or parachute duties and to authorize and direct individuals (non-aircrew) to
   perform non-interference flying duties. AOs initiating and authorizing aviation/parachutist
   service shall not be effective before the member is medically qualified.
   Note: ARMS AOs are not considered “computer-generated” as stated in AFI 33-328,
   Administrative Orders. HARM offices evaluate the products, process all required changes in
   ARMS, and an Aviation Resource Manager generates the AO. (T-1)
   4.3.2. Maintained in individual FRFs/JRFs to provide a complete chronological history of
   each individual’s aviation/parachutist career. A record set will be maintained in the HARM
   office file system until it is moved to the staging area. (T-1)
   4.3.3. Distributed according to Table 4.2. (T-1)
   4.3.4. Completed according to Table 4.1 (T-1)
   4.3.5. With 1C0 MFM concurrence and OG/CC approval, and subject to the qualification
   requirements listed in paragraph 2.6.1., the assistant CHARM may sign aeronautical orders
   on behalf of the CHARM. Additionally, the statement “Signed for” must be written or typed
   above the signature block and the assistant CHARM will sign his or her name above the
   CHARM’s signature block. The 1C0 MFM will document this approval. Note: The only
   authentication stamp authorized on AOs is the CSAF stamp on Department of the Air Force
   (DAF) AOs. (T-1)
4.4. AO Publication. Publish AOs for:
   4.4.1. Officers and enlisted qualified for an aviation career (restricted to rated officers,
   CEAs, officers in flying training leading to award of an aeronautical rating, or enlisted
   members in flying training leading to the CEA designation) to: (T-1)
       4.4.1.1. Start or stop the requirement to perform operational flight/jump duty. (T-1)
   4.4.2. Members (officer and enlisted) not qualified for an aviation/parachutist career to: (T-
   1)
       4.4.2.1. Initiate or terminate member‘s requirement to perform regular and frequent
       flight as a crewmember. (T-1)
       4.4.2.2. Direct and record changes to ASC/FAC “4”, “5”, “6”, “8”, and “E” duties and
       incentive pay entitlement. (T-1)
 54                                                                AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


      4.4.2.3. Establish or terminate member’s requirement to perform frequent and regular
      parachute jump duties as a parachutist member. (T-1)
      4.4.2.4. Initiate operational support and non-interference flying. Once an AO terminates,
      it is no longer in effect. Do not publish an AO to terminate aviation service for these
      members. (T-1)
   4.4.3. Award authorized basic ratings and badges. AOs that award aeronautical ratings,
   aircrew member badges, and parachutist ratings are single-action orders. The local HARM
   office shall update ARMS to award the advanced rating/badge effective the date the member
   satisfies requirements IAW AFI 11-402. (T-1)
   4.4.4. Publish AOs for professionally qualified government civilian employees using AF
   Form 1887, Aeronautical Order. Do not publish AOs for qualified members of other US
   military or foreign services (unless in UFT), or government contractors. Place all members
   on the unit‘s flight authorization. (IAW AFI 11-401). Validate US military and Foreign
   Service members have competent orders (AOs, special orders or International Travel Order
   (ITO) depending on assignment status) from their respective service directing them to
   perform flying duties. HARM offices may enter other US military, Foreign Service,
   government contractor, or government civilian members in ARMS for the purpose of
   tracking aircrew training, physical, and physiological qualifications when the member
   performs flying duties on a frequent basis. (T-1)
4.5. AO General Instructions.
   4.5.1. The HARM office prepares AOs IAW this instruction and inputs from unit SARM
   offices, commanders (including unit commanders), and AF/A3O-AI. (T-1)
      4.5.1.1. Number AOs in chronological order, starting with number one for each fiscal
      year. Cite, above the heading of the first order of a year, the number of the last order
      published the previous year.
      Example: “FY13 Last AO was #2140.” File the current and previous fiscal year in the
      HARM office prior to forwarding to the staging area. File AOs in the record set in
      chronological order with most current on top. (T-1)
          4.5.1.1.1. A record set of AOs contains all orders published during a fiscal year, to
          include cut in errors, regular, amendment and revocation orders. Each order number
          must be accounted for (AO log required), from the first order through the last order
          published for that fiscal year. Multiple logs and numbers (with letters added) are not
          authorized. The AO log as a minimum will contain: the AO number, member’s name,
          action/effective date, processor’s initials/date, and a column that verifies
          amendments/revocations were posted in the master record set and FRF (as required).
          (T-1) Template example of ‘AO Log’ is located on the Aviation Resource
          Management SharePoint site at:                 https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-

          4.5.1.1.2. A separate file of background material (from official sources) which
          supports each order’s publication must be maintained for each fiscal year IAW
          AFMAN 33-363 and disposed in accordance with the Air Force RDS schedule.
          Annotate (in ink) the background material information in the lower right-hand margin
          to show the order number to which it pertains. AO’s cut in error do not require a
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                       55


         source document on file. For example: Background material for AO # 0527, dated 26
         Nov 2012. File background material in chronological order with most current on top.
         (T-1)
             4.5.1.1.2.1. Post amendment AOs to the HARM office record set and FRF/JRF.
             Post revocation AOs to the HARM office record set only. If the revoked AO was
             used as an MPO, file it in the MPO section IAW paragraph 4.2.5.5. Example:
             “Amended/Revoked by AO #2705, 433d OSS, dated 12 Dec 13.” (T-1)
         4.5.1.1.3. Source documents include information from personnel database interfaces,
         finance system documents, re-enlistment papers, etc. Do not use documents that
         transferred dates or information from one source document to another, use the initial
         source. (T-1)
     4.5.1.2. Confirm verbal orders (in writing) within three duty-days. Include in the written
     order the date and by whom the verbal order was issued, and if flying/jump status or
     aeronautical ratings/badges were affected, and a statement why written orders were not
     issued earlier.
     Example: "The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances
     prevented written orders in advance." (T-1)
  4.5.2. Unit commanders shall notify the HARM office to request aviation or parachutist
  service actions that originate at the unit level.
  Example: Initiating aviation/parachutist service, non-interference flying, or operational
  support requests. (T-1)
  4.5.3. HARM offices may publish a single aeronautical order affecting several members
  providing the action is exactly the same for each member. For group orders, mask
  information protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 (SSNs) to prevent unauthorized
  disclosure. (T-1)
  4.5.4. A single AO may be published directing several actions that pertain to an individual,
  provided all actions have the same effective and termination dates. (T-1)
  Exception: AOs awarding aeronautical ratings or badges do not contain other actions. (T-1)
  4.5.5. Use AF Form 1887 or ARMS AO to amend or revoke a previous AO. (T-1)
     4.5.5.1. Amend AOs to correct minor administrative errors (erroneous SSN, improper
     grade, termination date, misspelled name, etc.), if the intent of the original order is
     unaffected by the correction. The amendment order shall contain the original effective
     date and only other required identifying data (name, grade, SSN, crew position, and
     organization) and the amended data. If other personal data is the same as the AO being
     amended (ASD, ASC, FAC, etc.), it may also be included on the AO. Underline
     amended items and reference the amended item(s) in the AO remarks. (An amendment
     makes the amended order read as it should have initially). An AF Form 1887 is the
     recommended medium for amending an AO because, as an automated system, ARMS
     automatically includes current information that may not be applicable for the effective
     period of the AO being amended. This information may be included if it mirrors the AO
     being amended. Use of AF Form 1887 avoids HARM system "work-arounds" that entail
     entering false data into ARMS. False data may interface with other Air Force systems
     and corrupt promotion or assignment processes. (T-1)
56                                                              AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


        4.5.5.1.1. HARM offices may use a single amendment AO to correct erroneous data
        on more than one AO if the data to be changed is the same on each incorrect AO.
        Example: A HARM office may generate one AO to amend the ASD and termination
        date on two separate AOs after an ASD adjustment. Correct the ASD and termination
        date and list each AO number that required correction in the remarks section of the
        amendment AO. (T-1)
        4.5.5.1.2. Do not publish an amendment order to correct information on another
        amendment order. Revoke the incorrect amendment and publish a single correct
        amendment. (T-1)
        4.5.5.1.3. Amending a termination date is authorized, except on an AO published to
        change a termination date. In this case, the AO’s intent was incorrect from the
        beginning. When amending an AO, document in ink the AO number and request date
        of the amendment AO on the lower left-hand margin of the original AO in the record
        set and FRF being amended.
        Example: Amended by AO #0410, dated 27 May 2013. (T-1)
        4.5.5.1.4. HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an effective date. Since
        the intent of a published AO is that the AO is valid from the beginning (effective
        date), an incorrect AO effective date invalidates that AO from the beginning. HARM
        offices must revoke the AO and publish a new AO with the correct effective date and
        the required aviation service change. (T-1)
        4.5.5.1.5. HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an erroneous OFDA total
        or FAC unless the AO was published to mark an aviation service point (e.g. 12 years
        of aviation service, or to assign FAC 6/E). (T-1)
        4.5.5.1.6. HARM offices will not amend a past AO solely to correct an erroneous
        authority paragraph reference or remark sections. The authority paragraph reference
        must be correct on the member‘s current AO. (T-1)
        Note: HARM offices are authorized to amend other HARM offices’ AOs (provide
        copy to original office). (T-1)
     4.5.5.2. Do not rescind AOs. Action taken on a later AO supersedes only the same item
     on previous orders. Previously awarded items on an order maintain the same effective
     date.
     Example: MSgt Churchill, (ASC 9D) aeronautical order (AO) will terminate 22
     November 2013. However, MSgt Churchill reenlists on 15 Nov 2013, and will remain on
     active flying status. An AO must be published to reflect the new termination date based
     on the new DOS; the effective date of the new AO will remain the same as the original
     AO that placed MSgt Churchill on flying status. (T-1)
     4.5.5.3. Revoke an order when it is void and without effect from the beginning. (A
     revocation deletes the order from the chronological history in the member’s FRF/JRF.)
     However, the revoked AO must be filed with the record set background material of AOs
     to support the AO being published. When an AO is revoked, it no longer exists as an
     official document. Do not revoke a revocation; instead, publish a new order. (T-1)
     Example: When the HARM office publishes AO #0327 to revoke AO #0212. Remove
     AO #0212 from the FRF and file AO #0327 in the HARM office record set. When
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                          57


      revoking an AO, document in ink the AO number, the request date and the base of the
      revoking AO on the lower left-hand side margin of the revoked AO in the record set.
      Example: Revoked by AO #0327, dated 31 Jan 13, Tinker AFB. HARM offices must
      send a copy of the revoking AO to the original HARM office and both AOs to the
      member. The Revoking AO will be distributed in the same manner as the AO it revoked.
      AFPC/DPSIRR maintains a permanent file in member’s historical file to show all
      aviation service actions processed.
          4.5.5.3.1. Post each revoke AO to the HARM office record set. Unless, the revoke
          AO was used as an MPO, post revoke AO information in FRF/JRF, and file in MPO
          section IAW Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 of this instruction. “Z” out top portion of AO
          and write MPO purpose only. Enter an explanation in ink on the left margin of the
          original order.
          Example: “Revoked by AO #2705, dated 12 Dec 13.” (T-1)
          Note: If a revoked AO is also the MPO source document, file it in the MPO section
          of the FRF. It will not be filed in the chronological AO portion of the FRF. Line
          through AO portion of revoked order, ensure revoke statement is annotated on left-
          hand margin, and annotate “For MPO use only”. (T-1)
4.6. Restrictions on AO Publication.
   4.6.1. Non-interference AOs will be published for AFRC and ANG personnel while
   attending the Flight Screening Program. (T-1)
   4.6.2. The AO effective date will not precede the date the member met all eligibility
   requirements. (T-1)
   4.6.3. Prior to publication of an AO that will involuntarily terminate aviation service for
   non-CEA enlisted aircrew members, the HARM office must ensure the member was given a
   120-day generated notification before removal from aviation service (IAW AFI 11-402).
   Receipt of assignment notification documentation from the FSS, as directed by AFI 36-2102,
   Base-Level Relocation Procedures, verbal orders of the member’s unit commander (written
   confirmation must be received within three duty-days), or any official documentation
   received from AF/A3O-AI constitutes certification and will be noted in remarks of the
   published AO. Include the FSSs on distribution for all such AOs. (T-1)
   4.6.4. AOs shall not be published later than the effective date if the action changes, initiates,
   or terminates incentive pay entitlement or OFDA, unless: (T-1)
      4.6.4.1. The AO confirms an ASC change as a result of PCS. In this case, the effective
      date is the day after the member signs out from the losing organization, as provided by
      the FSS. A retroactive statement is not necessary for this action. HARM offices shall
      establish procedures to validate DDLDS as documented on the member’s in-processing
      checklist    by     requesting   a   MilPDS      interface    or   ad     hoc    report.
      Note: ARC personnel (non-EAD) use the Effective Date of Change of Strength
      Accountability (EDCSA) on the AF Form 1288 or assignment order, the effective date on
      the AF Form 2096 or MilPDS duty history. (T-1)
      4.6.4.2. The AO involves circumstances where a directive establishes an effective date of
      AO. Cite the governing directive that applies as authority. (T-1)
 58                                                                AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


4.7. Aviation Service Code (ASC), and Flying Activity Code (FAC) Effective Dates. Note:
HARM offices must verify UMD information to confirm that aircrew/parachutists are assigned
to an authorized flying/jump position prior to publishing AOs. HARM offices shall have UMDs
for their assigned aircrew on file in order to accomplish position validation. (T-1)
   4.7.1. Flying or parachuting duties, OFDA credit, and incentive pay start on the ASC
   effective date. Incentive pay terminates the day prior to the ASC effective of a suspension,
   disqualification, or termination. Assign the ASC effective date as follows: (T-1)
      4.7.1.1. Use the individual’s aviation service date for medically qualified officers and
      CEAs entering formal Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT), Undergraduate Remotely
      Piloted Aircraft Training (URT) or approved local initial qualification training (IQT)
      flying training courses where flying is part of the course. This date cannot be prior to
      member        meeting       qualification      requirements      IAW       AFI      11-402.
      Example: Lt Scheuneman class start date is 10 Jan 2014, but he did not accomplish his
      flight physical until 15 Jan 2014; the effective date of his AO will be 15 Jan 2014. (T-1)
      4.7.1.2. Use the day after DDLDS from the losing organization for a PCS move that
      requires an ASC change. This includes inactive officers/CEAs that require active AOs to
      attend formal flying training TDY enroute to PCS to an active flying assignment. Note:
      ARC personnel (non-EAD) use the Effective Date of Change of Strength Accountability
      (EDCSA) on the AF Form 1288 or assignment order, the effective date of the AF Form
      2096 or MilPDS duty history. (T-1)
      Exceptions: Exceptions are listed from 4.7.1.2.1 through 4.7.1.2.5.
          4.7.1.2.1. Use the day a rated officer or CEA UFT/URT graduate signs into the
          operational unit at the permanent base following initial qualification training to
          change the FSC from “X” to “A/Z.” (T-1)
          4.7.1.2.2. Use the day after departing the TDY location where initial qualification
          was completed to change FSC “X” to “A/Z” when an officer/CEA UFT/URT
          graduate PCS’s to their first operational unit and then goes TDY to complete initial
          qualification training. (T-1)
          4.7.1.2.3. A rated officer/CEA will retain FSC “X” until completion of MDS specific
          training, to include an approved in-unit course, as documented by a flight evaluation.
          Publish an AO to change the FSC “X” to “A/Z” effective the day after the AF Form
          8, AF Form 8a, or AF Form 3862. (T-1)
          4.7.1.2.4. Use the latest UFT/URT graduation date to publish the ASC change from
          1U to 1X (rated) or AU to AX (CEA). The UFT/URT HARM office will publish the
          AO. For CEA UFT/URTs without a formal graduation, use the effective date of the
          AF Form 8, AF Form8a, or AF IMT 3862. (T-1)
          4.7.1.2.5. A previously rated officer or CEA returning to another UFT course (to
          include URT) will maintain their current ASC until the UFT/URT class-start date.
          Example: Captain Cleveland, at Eglin AFB is a rated combat systems officer (CSO)
          with a current ASC of 1A. She is selected to attend pilot UFT at Laughlin AFB.
          Captain Cleveland departs Eglin AFB on 30 Apr 13. The UPT class-start date is 05
          May 13. The Laughlin HARM office changes Captain Cleveland’s ASC from 1A to
          1U effective 05 May 13. (T-1)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                        59


     4.7.1.3. FSC “K” authoritative guidance is detailed in AFI 11-401; HARM offices will
     use the below criteria as reference for publication for AO(s) for assignment of FSC “K”.
     Note: In all cases, the HARM office will publish the AO, with explanatory remarks. (T-
     1)
        4.7.1.3.1. Use the OG/CC letter or military orders directing assignment of FSC K
        when aircrew members assigned to an active Aircrew Position Indicator (API), but
        not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft, flying hours, unit deactivation,
        etc.). (T-1)
            4.7.1.3.1.1. Use the date of the OG/CC’s letter to return the member(s) back to
            active flying status from lack of support. (i.e. aircraft, flying hours, unit
            deactivation, etc.)
        4.7.1.3.2. For aircrew assigned to an active flying position and deploying to a non-
        flying position, use the effective date of the CED orders to the non-flying position to
        change FSC “A/Z” to “K.” (T-1)
            4.7.1.3.2.1. Use the date the member returned to home station from their non-
            flying deployment to change FSC “K” to “A/Z”. Date of return must be validated
            by a signed DD Form 1351-2 (or suitable substitute) or commander’s letter
            returning member to active aviation service IAW AFI 11-401. (T-1)
        4.7.1.3.3. Use the date of assignment to an active flying position to assign FSC K to a
        member that is awaiting a class start date for formal training. In all three examples
        below the member is placed in FSC K due to lack of support (member not qualified in
        current unit aircraft). Assign FSC “A/Z” effective the class start date of formal
        training.                                                                          (T-1)
        Example 1: MSgt Katie Carter, a qualified loadmaster in C130H, transfers to another
        unit to fly C130Js, but hasn’t attended formal training for that aircraft.
        Example 2: Capt Lesley Beard separated from AD, entered a position in the ARC
        and      is    awaiting     a      class     start     date     for   formal   training.
        Example 3: Maj Allen Gregory returned to an active flying position from inactive
        flying status and is awaiting a class start date for formal training.
            4.7.1.3.3.1. Use the date of the unit commander’s letter or class roster (attending
            formal training) to return member back to active flying status from lack of
            support. (T-1)
        4.7.1.3.4. Use the OG/CC letter approving return to aviation service as the source
        document to publish an AO to assign FSC “K” for aircrew members returned to
        service as the result of an FEB (T-1).
     4.7.1.4. Use the formal jump school training (leading to the basic parachutist rating)
     class start date as the AO effective date to initiate Air Force parachutist service for
     members initially assigned to an authorized jump (“J” prefix DAFSC or jump inherent
     DAFSC) UMD position. HARM offices may use TDY orders or formal training
     notification to jump school to process initial AO prior to the member attending training.
     (T-1)
60                                                                AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


        4.7.1.4.1. HARM offices shall publish AOs for parachutists to attend Military Free
        Fall (MFF) School prior to the member attending school, effective the class start date.
        Member must be on competent orders for that type of jumping and AOs must specify
        the type of pay (MFF). MFF pay will not start until the member performs a MFF
        jump. Once the member performs a MFF jump, MFF pay is authorized from
        effective date of the AO forward (if otherwise qualified). If the member does not
        complete the course, MFF pay terminates on the day the member is disenrolled from
        class. A new AO must be published effective the day after disenrollment to reinstate
        Static Line HDIP (if member returns to previous jump duty) or previous ASC held
        (prior to the class). (T-1)
            4.7.1.4.1.1. For members approved to attend a formal jump course prior to an
            approved assignment (PCS or PCA) to a “J” prefixed AFSC or jump inherent
            DAFSC, the HARM office will publish an AO authorizing jump status effective
            the class start date. HARM offices will process an AO assigning ASC 06
            effective one day after the course completion date. Member’s gaining HARM
            office will publish an AO authorizing active jump status again, once the member
            is officially assigned to the billet.
            Note: This is authorized only for members retraining, possessing an authorized
            jump inherent AFSC, or pending an assignment to a “J” coded position.
            AOs/HDIP are not authorized for members who are not approved to be assigned
            to a full-time, active jump position. (T-1)
     4.7.1.5. Use the duty effective date for officers/CEAs or civilian employees and changes
     in duty that does not involve PCS but requires an ASC change
     (suspension/disqualification actions, flying waivers, etc.). (T-1) Example: Maj Jillian
     Mishalob was assigned to an inactive position approved for a FAC waiver to support a
     contingency or the date on the letter the commander directs suspension/disqualification
     IAW AFI 11-402.
     Note: Duty effective date for civilian employees is located on a MAJCOM specific form
     which will also identify civilian status (rated/non-rated equivalent). Assign ASC 7A for
     rated equivalent status, ASC HA for CEA equivalent status and ASC 9D for non-
     rated/non-CEA equivalent. (T-1)
        4.7.1.5.1. Use effective date of formal training class to assign FSC L to
        aircrew/parachutist members attending a formal course of instruction that does not
        require flying/jumping as part of the syllabi of instruction, for more than 180 calendar
        days (i.e. medical training, language programs, etc.). Unit aviation management
        offices will notify the HARM immediately and forward a copy of the member's
        formal training RIP or other MilPDS products reflecting enrollment. (T-1)
     4.7.1.6. HARM offices will publish AOs to change FSC from “Z” to “A”, for Remotely
     Piloted Aircraft (RPA) aircrew members attending manned aircraft training prior to the
     member attending the formal training school and reassigned to an active flying position
     in a manned aircraft; effective date is the class start date.
     Note: Do not assign FSC “A” for RPA aircrew members attending refresher training in a
     manned aircraft and returning back to RPA unit; he/she will remain FSC “Z”. (T-1)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                     61


     4.7.1.7. For inactive aircrew approved to attend a formal flying qualification or
     requalification course prior to PCS or PCA to an active flying position, the HARM office
     will publish an AO assigning FAC “6/E” and FSC “A/Z” effective the class start date.
     Enter reason for AO in the remarks section.
     Note: Termination date for rated officers and CEA’s will be applicable gate. If a member
     attends a formal flying requalification course (from an inactive position), then returns
     back to the non-flying position awaiting PCS/PCA to an active flying position, the
     member will remain FAC “6/E” and FSC “A/Z.” (T-1)
        4.7.1.7.1. For an inactive aircrew deploying to positions requiring active flying, the
        HARM office will validate the requirement to fly/control utilizing the member’s

        established in the commander’s request letter and with a termination date not to
        exceed 365 days.
        Example: MSgt Tiffany McMinn, a qualified parachutist, currently not assigned to a
        “J” coded UMD position is approved to provide manning assistance on a Joint
        Readiness Exercise from 19 Jul 13 through 23 Sep 13. The HARM office would
        publish an AO effective 19 Jul 13, with a termination date of 23 Sep 13. AO remarks
        will reference approval letter justification. (T-1)
        4.7.1.12.4. If a parachutist reenlists without a break in service, publish a new AO to
        change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified, incentive pay and badge
        creditable months continue through this period. (T-1)
        4.7.1.12.5. Publish a new AO when type of jump duty changes (Static/MFF).
        Member must be required to perform MFF duty to be eligible for the MFF incentive
        pay rate. This includes attending MFF School. (T-1)
        4.7.1.12.6. Use the day a member is no longer assigned to an authorized UMD
        parachutist position to assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP Flying/Jump requirement
        terminated) at the same duty location. This includes members who retrain out of
        parachutist duties or members who are assigned to a unit that has no available jump
        authorizations (manning in excess of total UMD authorizations). (T-1)
        4.7.1.12.7. Use the day after DDLDS or jump school for the members who PCS to a
        base without an available UMD parachutist position (“J” prefix DAFSC or jump
        inherent DAFSC) IAW AFI 11-410 to remove the parachutist from parachute duty
        and assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP Flying/Jump requirements terminated).
        Note: ARC personnel (non-EAD) use the Effective Date of Change of Strength
        Accountability (EDCSA) on the AF Form 1288 or assignment order, the effective
        date on the AF Form 2096 or MilPDS duty history. (T-1)
        4.7.1.12.8. HARM offices will publish AOs for USAFA cadets and other approved
        Air Force members participating in jump related duties as part of the USAFA
        Airmanship Program. Use the effective date of entry to the USAFA Airmanship
        Program. The effective period of the AO authorizing parachutist service is limited to
        the period of training at the USAFA. Do not assign an aviation service code. Leave
        the ASC section of the AO blank. Neither jump duty credit nor jump incentive pay
        are authorized. (T-1)
     4.7.1.13. Non-rated officers and non-CEAs. The effective period of an AO authorizing
     aviation service as a non-rated/non-CEA aircrew member is limited by the member’s

         duty availability. The member must be assigned to an aircrew-prefixed manpower
         position on the UMD. For members initially beginning aviation status, the AO effective
         date is the date the member is certified for aircrew duty and is entered into a formal
         school where in-flight duties (not observation) are part of the course curriculum. (T-1)
         Example 1: On 1 Jun 13, SMSgt Bernhart reported to the base for aircrew duty. On 15
         Jun 13, the commander certified eligibility and assigned the member to an aircrew-
         prefixed manpower position on the UMD. SMSgt Bernhart departed TDY for the formal
         training school with a class start date of 01 Jul 13. The AO effective date is 01 Jul 13.
         Example 2: On 1 May 13, Capt Dukes-Johnson reported to his base of assignment for
         aircrew duty. On 15 May 13, the commander certified eligibility, assigned the member to
         the appropriate UMD aircrew prefixed DAFSC, and notified the HARM office of in-
         flight training start date. On 20 May 13, Capt Dukes-Johnson began formal in-unit flying
         training. The AO effective date is 20 May 10; however, the training must lead toward
         initial qualification.
            4.7.1.13.1. For previous non-rated/non-CEA inactive aircrew members assigned to
            an active flying position at the gaining unit, HARM offices will assign ASC “9D”
            (Active Non-rated Aircrew Member) effective one day after member departed last
            duty station, providing the member is qualified for aircrew duty and is assigned to an
            authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew “X,” “K,” or “Q” (Officers may also hold a
            “B”, “C”, and “F” prefix) UMD DAFSC position, not occupied by another active
            flyer. If there was no PCS involved, use the effective date of duty (if otherwise
            qualified).
            Note: ARC personnel (non-EAD) use the Effective Date of Change of Strength
            Accountability (EDCSA) on the AF Form 1288 or assignment order, the effective
            date on the AF Form 2096 or MilPDS duty history. Also reference AFI 11-402 for
            limitations on exceeding UMD manpower authorizations for non-rated/non-CEA
            aircrew positions. (T-1)
            4.7.1.13.2. Use the date the non-rated/non-CEA aircrew member is no longer
            assigned to an authorized aircrew “X,” “K,” or “Q” prefixed (Officers may also hold
            a “B”, “C”, and “F” prefix) UMD manpower position to terminate aviation service
            and assign ASC “9J” (Inactive-Restricted).
            Note: This paragraph also applies to members approved for retraining. (T-1)
            4.7.1.13.3. If a non-rated aircrew member reenlists without a break in service,
            publish a new AO to change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified,
            incentive pay and badge creditable months continue through this period. (T-1)

personnel. Each flyer will have an in-processing checklist and training folder (electronic
documentation may be used). (T-3)
5.4. Area of Responsibility. SARM offices shall update ARMS for aircrew/parachutist
members assigned to the duty station and flying/parachuting with the unit. HARM offices shall
update ARMS with flying/jump accomplishments for members not assigned to an airborne,
flying unit, or a unit that does not have 1C0 personnel attached to support them, unless otherwise
delegated to another SARM/HARM office in a memorandum of agreement or operating
instruction. (T-1)
5.5. In-processing checklist. SARM offices shall use and maintain an in-processing checklist.
Note: Accomplish the following after the record has been in-processed in ARMS: (T-3)
Template example of the ‘In-processing Checklist’ is located on the Aviation Resource
Management SharePoint site at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-85/default.aspx
   5.5.1. Verify the HARM assigned a flying organization, member has a current flight
   physical, altitude chamber (if applicable), and has a current AO with the appropriate ASC.
   Note: For non-rated, non-CEA enlisted, and parachutist, the commander must submit a
   request letter to the HARM certifying a member’s eligibility for aviation/parachutist duties
   IAW AFI 11-402/11-410. (T-3)
   5.5.2. Obtain/verify letter of attachment and file in training folder prior to first flight in the
   unit. Provide a copy to the HARM office IAW AFI 11-401 (if required). (T-3)
   5.5.3. Review aircrew training currencies and grounding events. Take appropriate actions
   prior to member’s first flight/jump. (T-3)
   5.5.4. Input flying time/jump extracts and training accomplishments, as necessary. (T-3)

MARs, the SARM shall print Individual Training Summaries (ITS) each month during the
training period (may be maintained electronically). (T-3)
5.8. AF Form 4324 Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet. The AF Form
4324 is the source document for aircraft assignment, updating initial qualification events,
recording changes to aircrew qualification/certification or upgrades and prorating aircrew
training requirements into ARMS. Maintain AF Form 4324 for assigned or attached aircrew
members on file to validate the member’s qualifications.
Exception: Units may utilize class entry letter or MilPDS class training roster in lieu of an AF
Form 4324 for individuals attending formal flying training (e.g. UFT or FTU). During formal
training, UFT/FTU are authorized to use mission forms to update crew positions/assign profiles
accordingly when immediately entering another upgrade (i.e. completed basic qualification and
entering mission) to prevent delays in training if they are documented with Q1 and signed by an
evaluator.
Note 1: Units may use an “end of training cycle proration letter” in lieu of an AF Form 4324.
The AF Form 4324 may be maintained electronically.
Note 2: SARM(s) do not need to recreate or obtain any AF Form 4324(s) from a previous duty
station. (T-3) Template example of ‘End of Training Cycle Proration Letter’ is located on the
Aviation Resource Management SharePoint site at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-
85/default.aspx
   5.8.1. Maintain original Aircraft Assignment AF Form 4324 or FTU/UFT training entry
   document throughout member’s duty assignment and ensure commander’s signature per
   instructions on the reverse side of the AF Form 4324. (T-3)
   5.8.2. Assign training profiles to newly assigned/attached aircrew/parachutists prior to first
   flight/jump, if applicable. Coordinate position assignment and AO action with the HARM as
   necessary. The training officer or designated representative will direct the SARM personnel
   in writing prior to first flight, via an AF Form 4324, to assign appropriate training profiles.
   (T-3)
       5.8.2.1. For students awaiting formal flying training, the formal training unit (FTU), the
       SARM shall manage ARMS profile updates once enrolled in training (if applicable).
       Effective date of profiles will be the start date of formal flying course. Note: FTUs may
       assign ground training profiles earlier than class start date to ensure validation of
       prerequisite training. (T-3)
   5.8.3. The Aircrew Training or Standardization/Evaluation or equivalent section will initiate
   and sign an AF Form 4324’s for newly assigned/attached aircrew/parachutist to SARM
   personnel. All request(s) for changes to qualification and/or certification will originate at the
   Unit Standardization/Evaluation section to ensure the source documents agree with the
   aircrew/parachutist Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) before updating ARMS.
   Exception: Units may utilize class rosters or MilPDS class training roster in lieu of an AF
   Form 4324 for individuals attending formal flying training (e.g. UFT or FTU).
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                           73


   Example: Update from flight qualified to mission qualified, from instructor to evaluator,
   etc. (T-3)
   5.8.4. All AF Form 4324s generated during the current training period will be maintained
   until the end-of-training cycle. At the end of each training cycle, the SARM will maintain
   and file a copy of the Letter of Xs and Training Profile Assignment List to validate
   qualifications from the previous training cycle. After verification, the SARM will remove
   previous AF Form 4324s from the member’s training folder and place in a transitory file (see
   note). (T-3)
   Note 1: Maintain aircraft assignment for duration of member’s duty assignment. (T-3)
   Note 2: At the wing FM’s discretion, units may maintain previous training cycles AF Form
   4324s in the member’s ATMF, Part 5 for historical purposes only and will not be an
   inspectable item. If the unit maintains inactive AF Form 4324s, the unit will describe
   procedures in their unit’s continuity book. (T-3)
   5.8.5. SARM offices may use AF Form 1042s, non-flying TDY orders, or proration letters
   authenticated by unit training offices for DNIFs, non-flying TDYs, or non-flying periods due
   to formal schools or other authorized reasons IAW AFI 11-2MDS, if applicable. (T-3)
5.9. AF Form 1042 Procedures. Ensure SARM has the most current DNIF listing available
(i.e. DNIF browser, DNIF log, etc.). The HARM office is the office of primary responsibility for
AF Form 1042 procedures and processing for the ARM database IAW paragraph 3.16.;
coordinate SARM AF Form 1042 Procedures with the HARM. (T-3)
5.10. Flight Authorizations. Prepare, publish, and maintain Flight Authorization (FA) IAW
AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM instructions. Maintain FAs in one file, in numerical order, and retain
IAW the AF RDS in AFRIMS, Table 13-10. Ensure all local and off-station FAs contain a flight
order number printed on the form. Issue FA numbers chronologically, beginning at the start of
the Fiscal Year (FY). Track/control FAs on a log. 1C0 MFMs may authorize units to maintain a
separate file and log for off-station flights. (T-3)
Note 1: RPA units shall maintain/file the pre-flight authorizations with the Flight
Authorizations. This is due to RPA LRE and MCE perform Go/No-Go checks at each location.
(T-3)
Note 2: If TFI units are working in one office, TFI units may combine FA logs into one plan.
(T-3) Template example of ‘FA Log’ is located on the Aviation Resource Management
SharePoint site at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-85/default.aspx
   5.10.1. Flight authorizations are not published for missions not controlled/owned by the Air
   Force. SARM offices shall still complete required Go/No-Go or TDY worksheets (when
   applicable) and ensure proper documentation of authorized flight/training accomplishments
   as needed. (T-3)
5.11. SARM Pre-Mission Review. All SARM offices shall verify Go/No-Go items for all
flyers prior to flight IAW AFI 11-401 to include any grounding items referenced in AFI 11-202,
and AFI 11-2MDS. The minimum items for Go/No-Go verification include the following items
prior to flying: flight physical, DNIF status, altitude chamber, centrifuge (if applicable), Aviation
Service Code (ASC), and AO effective and termination dates, qualification dates, letter of
attachments, aircraft assignment, flight time maximums.
Note: SARM shall have back-up products on-hand/available (i.e. electronically or printed) to
 74                                                                   AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


validate all assigned aircrew; this process is to ensure base/unit can operate effectively during
connectivity outages. Back-up products will be produced at least weekly. (T-1)
5.12. SARM Post-Mission Review. Validate all flying hour and training data before manual
input or interface push to ARMS. As a minimum, compare the Flight Authorization (FA), AFTO
Form 781, and training data source (Mission Accomplishment Report (MAR)/Training
Accomplishment Report (TAR)) for compliance with applicable AFIs. Continuation Training
(CT) events will be logged in Zulu date to match the AFTO Forms 781 and the Flight
Authorizations IAW AFI 11-202.         Ensure timely input of information into ARMS.
Note: If the SARM office has dual monitors, MAJCOM FM may approve the use of electronic
audit prior to the push to ARMS. (T-1) Template example of ‘MAR/TAR’ is located on the
Aviation Resource Management SharePoint site at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-
85/default.aspx
   5.12.1. Validate all jump activity (AF Form 4323 or 922) before manual input or interface
   push to ARMS. As a minimum, compare the source document and the training data source
   (Mission Accomplishment Report (MAR)/Training Accomplishment Report (TAR)) for
   compliance with applicable AFIs. Ensure timely input of information into ARMS. Note: If
   the SARM office has dual monitors, MAJCOM FM may approve the use of electronic audit
   prior to the push to ARMS. (T-3)
   5.12.2. Ensure aircrew/parachutist members complete and turn in a MAR/TAR for each
   flight/jump (if applicable). Units may log/maintain training accomplishments in an Air Force
   approved electronic database for interface to ARMS. As a minimum, maintain training
   accomplishment data (paper or preferably electronic) for the current and previous training
   cycle.
   Note: Wing 1C0 FM shall establish procedures for all SARMs to indicate when
   aircrew/parachutist members do not accomplish training (e.g. TAR with “Events not

Regulation (DoDFMR) 7000.14R, Volume 7A, Chapters 22 (Active Duty), 57/58 (Air Reserve
Component) with Air Force policy to execute the flying incentive pay programs. This chapter is
used in conjunction with AFIs 11-401 and 11-402 for crediting flight time and qualification of
aviation service. Accessibility of Attachments: Due to the nature of continuous evolving AF
policy, all attachments included in this instruction will be located on the Aviation Resource
Management SharePoint site at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-85/default.aspx
7.2. Waiver. This chapter includes (T-0) and (T-1).
Note: This chapter expands the ‘how to’ validate and verify entitlement to pay and perform
MPO actions. The primary directive to apply and credit flight time is the DoD Financial
Management Regulation.
7.3. Terms.
   7.3.1. Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP).
       7.3.1.1. Rated officers must be entitled to basic pay, hold a current aeronautical rating or
       be enrolled in training leading to an aeronautical rating, and be qualified for aviation
       service according to AFIs 11-401 and 11-402 to receive continuous or conditional ACIP.

       7.3.1.3. Air Battle Staff Duties. Rated General Officers that satisfy minimum flight
       time requirements will receive ACIP until completion of 25 years of Aviation Service, if
       otherwise qualified. Inactive members who perform non-crew member duties are entitled
       to Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) provided they do not receive ACIP
       concurrently. These members will log non-crew member time (crew position FZ) IAW
       AFI 11-401. The servicing HARM office will publish an AO reflecting the type of
       incentive pay authorized IAW DoDFMR. In the remark section of the AO, cite “FAC 8:
       member is performing in-flight non-crew member Air Battle Staff duties”. Do not
       establish a new ASC for a member performing Air Battle Staff duties.
   7.3.2. Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP).
       7.3.2.1. CEAs must be entitled to basic pay, hold a 1AXXX AFSC or be enrolled in
       formal flying training leading to a designation as a CEA, and be qualified for aviation

AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                      87


     7.3.3.2. Operational support flyers are personnel required to perform inflight duties on an
     occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs, non-rated officers,
     or non-career enlisted aviators IAW AFIs 11-401 and 11-402. These members receive
     HDIP.
     7.3.3.3. Rated or CEA personnel not already receiving ACIP or CEFIP are eligible to
     receive HDIP for the entire month IAW this instruction if they log at least 4.0 hours of
     qualifying flight time (if otherwise qualified), they are eligible to receive HDIP for the
     entire month.
  7.3.4. Aviation Incentive Pay (AVIP). RPA Incentive Pay authorized are those active duty
  and ARC who are performing service, while entitled to basic pay and while holding an 18XX
  AFSC assigned as RPA pilot performing RPA pilot duties and assigned to RPA training in
  order to receive the above referenced AFSC. Eligible recipients shall also meet all other
  criteria applicable to aviators receiving aviation career incentive pay (ACIP).
  7.3.5. Career Enlisted Aviation Incentive Pay (CEVIP). RPA Incentive Pay authorized
  are those active duty and ARC who are performing service, while entitled to basic pay and
  while holding an 1U0X1 AFSC assigned as RPA sensor operators performing RPA sensor
  operator duties and assigned to RPA training in order to receive the above referenced AFSC.
  Eligible recipients shall also meet all other criteria applicable to aviators receiving career
  enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP).
  7.3.6. Crediting and Non-crediting Criteria. AFI 11-401 establishes guidance regarding
  logging and crediting flight time for incentive pay. Do not credit flight time logged in a
  simulator toward flying hour requirements.
  7.3.7. Aerial flight. Flights performed in an aircraft when required by competent orders. In
  the context of this chapter, aeronautical orders are competent orders.
  7.3.8. Flight Activity. A member performing inflight hazardous duty while obtaining or
  maintaining qualification IAW AFIs 11-202 Volume 1, 11-401, and 11-2 MDS Specific.
  7.3.9. Minimum Flight Time Requirement. Aerial flight time required to satisfy a
  month’s flying hour requirement. Minimum flight time applies to all aircrew members in a
  conditional pay status. IAW the DoDFMR, minimum flight is four hours per month or a
  prorated amount for members on active flying status for a fraction of the month (also
  reference paragraph 7.8 and subparagraphs for flight time requirements pertaining to ARC
  members). (T-0)
  7.3.10. Fractions of a Calendar Month (Conditional Flyers Only). Flight time
  requirements may be prorated when the member is placed on flying status for part of the
  month or removed from flying status before the end of the month. Use the AO effective date
  and/or AO termination date to determine the number of days the member was on flying status
  for a fraction of a month. (Refer to the Fractions of a Calendar Month table IAW the
  DoDFMR). Calculate the number of days from the AO effective date to the end of the
  month, the number of days from the first of the month to the AO termination date, or from
  the AO effective date until the AO termination date for members placed on flying status for a
  fraction of a single month. (T-0)
  Example 1: A member is placed on flying status effective 3 Feb (AO effective date).
  Calculate the number of days the member was on flying status starting with the effective date
88                                                                  AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


  of the AO. The member is available for 26 of the 28 days in Feb. IAW the DoDFMR, the
  flight time requirement for Feb is 3.5 hours.
  Example 2: A member is placed on flying status effective 18 Jan (AO effective date)
  through 29 Jan (AO termination date). Calculate the number of days the member was on
  flying status starting with the effective date of the AO, and ending with the termination date
  of the AO. The member is available for 12 of the 31 days in Jan. IAW the DoDFMR, the
  flight time requirement for Jan is 1.6 hours.
  Example 3: A member is removed from flying status 15 Dec (AO effective date). Calculate
  the number of days the member was on flying status from 1 Dec through 14 Dec. The
  member is available for 14 of the 31 days in Dec. The flight time requirement for Dec is 1.9
  hours.
  Note: When incentive pay status changes from continuous to conditional, flight time logged
  in a continuous status may not be applied to the conditional flying hour requirements.
  Incentive pay will restart when the member qualifies for entitlement to conditional incentive
  pay using only those hours flown from the effective date of the conditional status AO
  forward, if otherwise qualified. Also applies to a member returning from disqualified status
  (i.e. ASC “07”).
  7.3.11. Suspension (Conditional Flyers Only). When a member is removed from flying
  status as a result of suspension, the HARM office must wait until action is completed to
  determine if the member qualified for a proportionate rate of pay during the month. Pay will
  terminate the last day of the month prior to the month of suspension if flight requirements
  were met. Do not use banked hours towards entitlement to pay for a portion of a month a
  member was suspended until the suspension action is resolved (if otherwise qualified). If
  disqualification is approved, the disqualification AO will have the same effective date as the
  original suspension AO and pay may be authorized for the portion of the month when the
  member was not suspended, if otherwise qualified. If the suspension is revoked with no
  disqualification, the requirements will revert to 4.0 hours (a full month's flight time
  requirement). (T-0)
  Example 1: Member was suspended from aviation service effective 19 Jul 13 with 3.4 hours
  in the bank. HARM personnel submitted a MPO to terminate HDIP effective 30 Jun 13 and
  waited for final disqualification action. If the member is ultimately disqualified, the effective
  date of disqualification will be 19 Jul 13 (effective date of original suspension). In this case,
  HARM personnel would submit a MPO to pay the member for 1-18 Jul 13 using the banked
  hours.
  Example 2: Member had a total of 1.6 hours in the bank and was suspended from flying
  effective 3 Jan 13. Although the member’s hours in the bank are sufficient to pay the
  member for 1 - 2 January, the HARM personnel will submit a MPO to stop pay effective 31
  Dec 12. If the suspension is revoked without disqualification action, the flight time
  requirement for Jan 13 will revert to 4.0 hours. In this case, the 1.6 hours in the bank would
  not be sufficient to authorize incentive pay for January.
  7.3.12. Disqualification. For members in a conditional pay status, excess flight time logged
  prior to the disqualification is considered lost and may not be applied if the member is
  requalified for aviation service. Incentive pay will restart when the member qualifies for
  entitlement to conditional incentive pay using hours flown from the effective date of the
  requalification AO forward, if otherwise qualified. (T-0)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                        89


  7.3.13. Insufficient Flight Time. Insufficient flight time is time accrued that does not meet
  the minimum monthly flying hour requirement.
  7.3.14. Excess Flight Time. Excess Flight Time is a combination of flight time in excess of
  the time required and insufficient time to qualify for a particular month.
  Example 1: Member is on flying status for the entire month of Jun and must perform
  inflight duties for at least 4.0 hours to qualify for conditional incentive pay for the month.
  The member accrued 6.0 hours in Jun. The additional 2.0 hours flown are banked as excess
  flight                                                                                     time.
  Example 2: Member is required to perform inflight duties for at least 4.0 hours in Jul to
  qualify for conditional incentive pay. The member accrued 1.5 hours. The 1.5 hours are
  insufficient to satisfy flight time requirements for that month and are banked as excess time.
  7.3.15. Banked Time. (N/A for operational support flyers) Banked time is excess flight
  time (including both excess and insufficient hours) available to satisfy later months’ (current
  month plus 5 succeeding months’) flight time requirements.
  7.3.16. Aviation Accident. A member in conditional incentive pay status (including
  students in formal flying/parachutist training on competent AOs) injured or otherwise
  incapacitated while performing in-flight or other hazardous duty he or she was ordered to
  perform, shall be considered to have met flight requirements for no longer than three months
  while incapacitated.
  Note: Member is entitled to flight and jump pay that is injured performing parachutist duty
  is entitled up to three months of both pays due to the parachutist injuries. (T-0)
     7.3.16.1. If the member satisfied flight time requirements for the month during which the
     injury occurred, incentive pay entitlement under this provision begins the first day of the
     month following the month during which the injury occurred. Hours flown in excess of
     the required hours used to qualify the member for pay may be banked and used IAW the
     rules of application. (T-0)
     Example: A flyer is incapacitated in January while performing hazardous duty. If the
     member satisfied flight time requirements for January before the injury occurred,
     incentive pay entitlement under the “aviation accident” provision begins the first day of
     February. Member is entitled to pay for Jan, Feb, Mar, and Apr.
     7.3.16.2. If the member had not met requirements for the month during which the injury
     occurred, incentive pay entitlement under this provision begins the first day of the month
     during which the injury occurred. The insufficient hours flown during the month the
     injury occurred may be banked and carried forward up to five months IAW the rules of
     application.                                                                          (T-0)
     Example: A flyer is incapacitated in January while performing hazardous duty. If the
     member did not satisfy flight time requirements for January incentive pay entitlement
     under the ”aviation accident” provision begins the first day of January. Member is
     entitled to pay for Jan, Feb, and Mar.
     7.3.16.3. Entitlement to incentive pay continues under this provision until the recovery
     date as determined by the medical authority, or until the last day of the third month
     following the month in which entitlement to incentive pay under the “aviation accident”
     provision began, whichever occurs first. (T-0)
     Example 1: A flyer is injured in January while performing hazardous duty and has not
 90                                                               AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


       met requirements for January. The member is entitled to pay for January through March,
       or through the end of the month of return to flying status, whichever occurs first.
       Insufficient hours from January may be banked as excess flight time and carried forward
       up to five months.
       Example 2: A flyer is injured in January while performing hazardous duty and has not
       met requirements for January. The member returned to flying status on 15 Feb. The
       member is entitled to pay for January and February. Insufficient hours from January may
       be banked as excess flight time and carried forward up to five months.
7.4. Order of Application for Conditional Entitlement. (N/A for operational support flyers).
HARM personnel will comply with the order of application discussed below. Apply each rule in
the order of application to one month at a time before moving to the next month. (T-0)
   7.4.1. Rule 1: First, apply hours flown in a month to the current month’s flight time
   requirement.
   7.4.2. Rule 2: Next, if the member is in a grace period, apply excess flight time accrued
   during the month to the previous month or months to satisfy flight time requirements. If the
   full grace period requirement is not satisfied, excess hours will apply only to months in
   which flight activity was performed; reference paragraphs 7.5. and 7.6.1.).
   7.4.3. Rule 3: Next, apply banked time to the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth
   succeeding months only to the extent the member fails to satisfy flight time requirements
   during each month. Use the oldest hours first. Reference the example below.

Figure 7.1. Rule 3 Example.




       7.4.3.1. -(March) Assume for purpose of this example, that the member had no excess
       flight time from the prior months. There are 11.5 excess hours from Mar (15.5 flown –
       4.0 required = 11.5 excess). (T-0)
       7.4.3.2. -(April) Use 2.7 banked hours from Mar to satisfy Apr flight time requirements
       (1.3 flown + 2.7 banked = 4.0). There are 8.8 hours available in the bank from Mar (11.5
       – 2.7 = 8.8 banked). (T-0)
       7.4.3.3. -(May) Use 1.3 banked hours from Mar to satisfy May flight time requirements
       (2.7 flown + 1.3 banked = 4.0). There are 7.5 hours available in the bank from Mar (8.8
       – 1.3 = 7.5 banked). (T-0)
       7.4.3.4. -(June) Use 1.0 banked hours from Mar to satisfy Jun flight time requirements
       (3.0 flown + 1.0 banked = 4.0). There are 6.5 hours available in the bank from Mar (7.5
       – 1.0 = 6.5 banked). (T-0)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                       91


       7.4.3.5. -(July) Use 2.5 banked hours from Mar to satisfy Jul flight time requirements
       (1.5 flown + 2.5 banked = 4.0). There are 4.0 hours in the bank from Mar (6.5 – 2.5 = 4.0
       banked). (T-0)
       7.4.3.6. -(August) Use 2.0 banked hours from Mar to satisfy Aug flight time
       requirements (2.0 flown + 2.0 banked = 4.0). The remaining 2.0 hours from Mar (4.0 –
       2.0 = 2.0 banked) is not used (lost) since Aug is the 5th succeeding month. (T-0)
       7.4.3.7. After applying excess hours as shown in above paragraphs 7.4.3.1. – 7.4.3.6, the
       member has 2.0 excess hours remaining at the end of Aug. Because banked hours from
       Mar can be used to satisfy flight requirements for up to five succeeding months, no
       banked hours are available to apply to Sep flight time requirements. The remaining 2.0
       banked hours from Mar is now not used (lost) time and Sep begins a grace period. (T-0)
7.5. Grace Period. (N/A for operational support flyers) A maximum three-month period for a
member to accrue sufficient hours to satisfy flight time requirements for a previous month(s)
when a shortfall occurred. (T-0)
   7.5.1. Beginning and Ending Grace Periods. Regardless of the effective date of an AO,
   begin a grace period with the first month a member has flight time requirements, but does not
   satisfy those flight time requirements and sufficient banked hours are not available to cover
   the shortfall. (T-0)
       7.5.1.1. Terminate the grace period at the end of the second month if the member
       satisfied flight requirements for the first two months. (T-0)
       7.5.1.2. Extend the grace period through the end of the third month if the member did not
       accrue sufficient hours by the end of the second month to satisfy flight time requirements
       for the first two months. The member must satisfy flight time requirements for the entire
       three-month period to be entitled to incentive pay for all three months. (T-0)
       7.5.1.3. In the example below, the grace period began with Aug (the first month the
       member had flight time requirements but did not satisfy those requirements. If the
       member accrues at least 8 hours of flight time in Sep, terminate the grace period at the
       end of that month. Otherwise, terminate the grace period at the end of Oct (third month
       of the grace period). (T-0)

Figure 7.2. Beginning and Ending Grace Period Example.




   7.5.2. Beginning Grace Periods when initially placed on flying status. The example
   below shows the correct action to take if a member does not satisfy flight time requirements
   for the first month placed on flying status. Assume the member was placed on status 8 Jul.
   Because the member was on flying status for 24 days during Jul, the flight time requirement
   for Jul was 3.2 hours. Because the member did not accrue at least 3.2 flying hours in Jul, a
   grace period was started. (T-0)
 92                                                                 AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


Figure 7.3. Initially Placed on Flying Status Example.




   7.5.3. When to begin a new grace period. A new grace period may begin after the member
   satisfies flight time requirements for the previous month or, if the previous month was part of
   a grace period, flight time satisfied the entire grace period requirement. Do not begin a new
   grace period until the member satisfies flight time requirements for one month following a
   failed grace period. (T-0)
       7.5.3.1. In the following example, the member entered a grace period in Jul, the grace
       period extended through the end of Sep, and the member accrued enough flying hours to
       satisfy the entire grace period. Therefore, the member was eligible to begin a new grace
       period in Oct.

Figure 7.4. New Grace Period Example.




       7.5.3.2. In the example below, the member was placed in a grace period in Jan. This
       grace period extended through the end of Mar, and the member did not accrue sufficient
       flying hours to satisfy the entire grace period. The member subsequently failed to satisfy
       flight time requirements for Apr. Because the member failed to satisfy flight time
       requirements for the previous grace period, a new grace period will not begin until the
       member satisfied requirements for one month following that grace period (May). The
       member is eligible to begin a new grace period in Jun. (T-0)

Figure 7.5. New Grace Period Following Inactivity Example.
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                       93


   7.5.4. Grace Period Rules when no flight activity occurred in the first month. If a
   member does not accrue flying hours during the first month of a grace period and, in the
   second-month, accrues at least 4 flying hours but less than 8 flying hours (including banked
   hours), authorize incentive pay for the second month only. (T-0)

Figure 7.6. New Grace Period in First Month Example.




   7.5.5. Grace Period Rules when no flight activity occurred in the first and second
   month. If a member does not accrue flying hours during the first two months of a grace
   period, the member must accrue at least 12 flying hours (including banked hours) by the end
   of the third month to be entitled to incentive pay for all three months. If the member accrues
   4 or more flying hours, but less than 12 flying hours (including banked hours ), authorize
   incentive pay for the third month only. Use 4.0 banked hours from Apr to satisfy May flight
   time requirements (4.0 banked). There is now 3.9 hours available in the bank from Apr (7.9
   – 4.0 = 3.9 banked). The member satisfied flight time requirements for May; therefore, a
   new grace period may begin in Jun. (T-0)

Figure 7.7. New Grace Period in First and Second Month(s) Example.




7.6. Application of Flight Time. (N/A for operational support flyers).
   7.6.1. Banked Flight Time. “Banked” time is flight time not previously used to satisfy a
   month’s flight time requirement. Banked hours may be used up to five months forward.
   Banked hours accrued prior to a grace period may be used to satisfy flight time requirements
   within the grace period. Several examples for the proper use of banked flying hours are
   shown below. (T-0)

Figure 7.8. Banked Flight Time Example 1.
 94                                                                 AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


Figure 7.9. Banked Flying Time Example 2.




Figure 7.10. Banked Flying Time Example 3.




      7.6.1.1. In the example above, examine the hours flown and apply the rules of
      application (IAW paragraph 7.4) one month at a time. The 1.0 hour flown in Aug was
      insufficient to satisfy that month's flight time requirement (rules of application, rule 1)
      and is now classified as excess flight time. The 1.0 hour from Aug cannot be moved
      backward because it's the first month in the grace period (rules of application, rule 2).
      There are no hours in the bank to satisfy the Aug requirement (rules of application, rule
      3). The 3.0 hours flown in Sep were insufficient to satisfy that month's flight time
      requirements (rules of application, rule 1) and are now classified as excess flight time.
      Because the member is in a grace period, use the 1.0 excess from Aug hours forward to
      satisfy the Sep requirement (rules of application, rule 2). IAW paragraph 7.5.1.2, the
      member did not meet the entire grace period flying hour requirement by the 3rd month
      (Oct), therefore, failed the grace period. The 1.0 hour excess from Oct is moved forward
      to satisfy flight time requirements for Nov. The member has zero hours in the bank in
      Dec and, since flight time requirements were met in Nov, they may start a new grace
      period. (T-0)
      Note: Excess hours may be applied only if the pay type, e.g. conditional to conditional,
      and flyer-type duties are the same, e.g. rated duty to rated duty. For example, hours
      accrued in conditional ASC 5A/ACIP may be applied to hours accrued in conditional
      ASC 6A/ACIP; hours accrued in conditional ASC 7A/ACIP may be applied to hours
      accrued in rated aircrew duties earning conditional HDIP (same flyer type duties); hours
      accrued in conditional ASC 7A/ACIP, however, will not be applied to hours accrued in
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                    95


      non-crew/non-rated duty (Airborne emergency action officer, mission crew commander,
      etc.) nor vice-versa. (T-0)
   7.6.2. Using excess time backward and forward. Excess hours may be used up to two
   months backward if the member is in a grace period, and up to five months forward from the
   month during which the excess hours were accrued. Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.11. Using Excess Time Backward and Forward.




      7.6.2.1. In the example above, the member began a grace period in the May and it ended
      in Jul. The member was entitled to incentive pay for May using 4.0 excess flying hours
      from Jul (two months backward within a grace period). The member was entitled to
      incentive pay for Aug using 2.0 excess flying hours from Jul (excess hours may be used
      up to five months forward). At the end of this period, the member had one excess flying
      hour in the bank from Jul. This hour may be used through Dec (five months forward
      rule). (T-0)
   7.6.3. Moving flight time into a grace period. Banked hours accrued prior to a grace
   period may be used within the grace period to satisfy flight time requirements. In the
   example below, the grace period began in Jan and ended in Feb. The 2.0 excess flying hours
   accrued before the grace period began (Nov) and 1.0 excess hour from Feb were applied to
   Jan to satisfy flight time requirements for the Jan, as well as the grace period. (T-0)

Figure 7.12. Moving Flight Time Into a Grace Period Example.




   7.6.4. Moving flight time within a grace period. In the example below, the grace period
   started in May and ended in Jul. Insufficient time from May and June is placed in the bank
   along with the remaining 0.3 excess hours from Jul. The member lost incentive pay for the
   first and second month. (T-0)

Figure 7.13. Moving Time Within a Grace Period Example 1.




      7.6.4.1. In the example below, the grace period began in Nov and ended in Jan. 3.0
      excess hours from Jan were applied to Nov to satisfy flight requirements for that month.
      Flying hours could not be applied to Dec because no flight activity occurred during that
 96                                                                 AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


      month and the member did not accrue sufficient hours to satisfy flight time requirements
      for the entire grace period.

Figure 7.14. Moving Time Within a Grace Period Example 2.




      7.6.4.2. In the example below, the grace period started in Jan and ended in Mar. 0.6
      hours from Jan and 0.3 hours from Mar were applied to the second month to satisfy flight
      time requirements for that month. The member did not accrue sufficient hours to satisfy
      the flight time requirement for Jan.

Figure 7.15. Moving Time Within a Grace Period Example 3.




   7.6.5. Moving time out of a grace period. Flight time accrued during a grace period but
   not used to satisfy flight time requirements during the grace period may be banked and
   carried forward. Reference the example below; the grace period began in Dec and ended in
   Feb. The member lost incentive pay for Dec and Jan, but was entitled to pay for Feb. The
   1.0 flying hours from Jan and 1.8 of the 2.0 excess flying hours from Feb were applied
   forward to Mar to satisfy flight time requirements for that month. At the end of this period,
   0.2 excess hours remained in the bank. (T-0)

Figure 7.16. Moving Time Out of a Grace Period Example.




   7.6.6. Military operations or non-availability of aircraft. If a member does not satisfy
   normal flight requirements due to military operations (combat or otherwise) or unavailability
   of aircraft (all aircraft are deployed or fleet is grounded for a three-month period) he or she
   may satisfy minimum flight time requirements by performing 24 hours of aerial flight over a
   period of six-consecutive calendar months. The member’s commander will certify in writing
   whether military operations or unavailability of aircraft prevented the member from
   completing normal flight requirements for the initial three-month period. At the end of the
   initial three-month period, HARM personnel will publish an MPO to terminate and collect
   incentive pay for months in the initial three-month period that the member failed to satisfy
   flight time requirements. At the end of the six-month waiver period, HARM personnel shall
   publish MPOs as required to authorize incentive pay.
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                         97


   Note: For ARC personnel, this policy applies only to members who are on six or more
   consecutive months on full time status and all AGR personnel. (T-0)
      7.6.6.1. If a member fails a three-month grace period due to military operations or non-
      availability of aircraft, the six-month waiver period begins on the first day of the initial
      three-month grace period. Reference the example below; assume the member accrued
      zero hours in the bank before May. The member entered a grace period in May due to
      insufficient flight time accrued. During the first month of the grace period all available
      aircraft were deployed for contingency operations. The member failed the initial three-
      month grace period. The member’s commander submitted a letter in Aug verifying that
      unavailability of aircraft caused the grace period failure. The CHARM published an
      MPO on the first day of Aug to terminate incentive pay effective the last day of Apr,
      prior to entry into the grace period. The member flew 24.0 hours during the remaining
      three months of the six-month period. At the end of the sixth month, the CHARM
      applied the provision for military operations or non-availability of aircraft and published
      an MPO to authorize incentive pay effective the first day of the grace period (May). The
      member satisfied flight time requirements for the six-month period. (T-0)

Figure 7.17. Military Operations or Non-availability of Aircraft Example 1.




      7.6.6.2. If a member is not in a three month grace period when the commander declares
      in writing that the provision for military operations or non-availability of aircraft exists,
      the first month in which military operations or aircraft non-availability prevents
      fulfillment of flight time requirements constitutes the beginning of the six-calendar-
      month waiver period for satisfying the 24-hour flight time requirement under this
      subparagraph. Reference the example below; assume the member’s commander
      submitted a letter verifying that all aircraft were deployed for a 120-day rotation effective
      15 Mar (1st month). The member accrued 4.0 flying hours during a sortie on 3 March and
      satisfied the flight time requirement for March before the commander submitted the
      letter. Therefore, the member entered a six-month grace period effective 1 Apr. The
      member accrued 25.6 flying hours during the six-month period that began on 1 Apr and
      ended 30 Sep. Therefore, this member satisfied the 24.0 hours flight time requirement
      for the six-month period and received incentive pay for the entire period. At the end of
      this period, the member accrued 1.6 banked hours that could be carried forward up to five
      months. (T-0)
 98                                                               AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


Figure 7.18. Military Operations or Non-availability of Aircraft Example 2.




      7.6.6.3. If a member enters a three month grace period due to military operations or
      aircraft non-availability, the six-calendar-month waiver period under this subparagraph
      begins effective the first day of the three-month grace period. At the end of the six-
      month grace period, the HARM office will use rules of application to determine months
      when flight time requirements were satisfied. Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.19. Military Operations or Non-availability of Aircraft Example 3.




          7.6.6.3.1. In the example above, the commander submitted a letter on 1 Apr (first day
          of the fourth month). The HARM office published an MPO on 1 Apr to terminate
          incentive pay effective 31 Dec. The six-month grace period ended on 30 Jun. The
          member accrued 22.0 flying hours during the six-month period. The member
          satisfied flight time requirements for Apr based on flight time accrued during that
          month. The excess hours from Apr will not be carried backward because the member
          failed the initial three-month grace period and did not accrue at least 24.0 hours
          during the six-month period. Excess hours from months 4-6 of a six-month grace
          period will not be applied to months 1-3 of the six-month grace period unless the
          member accrued at least the minimum flying hours needed to satisfy the entire six-
          month grace period. The six-month grace period ended on 30 Jun. Because the
          member failed the grace period, a new grace period will not start until the member
          meets flight time requirements for one month following the failed grace period.
          Because the member accrued sufficient excess hours in Apr to satisfy requirements
          for Jul and Aug (if required), a new grace period may begin in Sep or later.
      7.6.6.4. The provisions of military operations or non-availability of aircraft are
      applicable only if the member did not satisfy flight time requirements due to one of these
      causes. Reference the example below; assume the commander submitted a letter in Jan.
      Because the member accrued 16.0 excess hours in Dec, he or she satisfied flight time
      requirements for the initial three-month grace period and had sufficient excess hours in
      the bank to carry forward and satisfy the fourth and fifth months. Since the member met
      requirements in the initial three-month period, the six-month waiver letter was not
      applicable. (T-0)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                       99

   7.7.9. Monitoring Monthly Flight Pay Entitlement.
       7.7.9.1. Use the Flying Pay Control Document (FPCD) in conjunction with the AF Form
       1520 to monitor monthly entitlement to conditional incentive pay for active duty
       members. Use the ASC Conditional Entitlement Flying Hours Report in conjunction
       with the AF Form 1520a and the Attendance Calendar from DJMS-RC to monitor
       monthly entitlement to conditional incentive pay for reserve component members. (T-1)
       7.7.9.2. Complete the AF Form 1520 or 1520a (ARC) IAW the instructions on the
       reverse side of the form and maintain the document permanently in the FRF. Note 1:
       The office may keep the current worksheet in a suspense binder until the member departs
       via     PCS,     is    placed   on    inactive     status,  separates,     or   retires.
       Note 2: AF Form 1520 will be used for aircrew in an AGR status. (T-1)
       7.7.9.3. Notify an aircrew/parachutist member when pay entitlement status changes.
       Electronic notification via CMS satisfies this requirement provided the notification
       explains the action.

       AF-85/default.aspx
       7.7.9.4. Notify an aircrew member and/or parachutist in conditional status when he or
       she enters an incentive pay grace period. (T-1)
       7.7.9.5. Terminate incentive pay when members receiving conditional incentive pay
       status depart via permanent change of station (PCS) or permanent change of assignment
       (PCA) to an inactive position, retire, separate, are suspended, or disqualified (losing
       HARM office responsibility). (T-1)
   7.7.10. Entitlement Status Letter.
       7.7.10.1. Use the Entitlement Status Letter to notify rated officers and CEAs of incentive
       pay termination or a change in incentive pay entitlement status. (T-1)
       7.7.10.2. HARM personnel shall forward a signed copy of the Entitlement Status Letter
       to the member for review and signature three months before a change in entitlement
       status. The member shall return the signed copy to the HARM office and it will be filed

7.8. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Incentive Pay.
   7.8.1. Terms.
       7.8.1.1. Active Duty (AD). Active Duty is defined as full-time duty in the active service
       of a Uniformed Service, including full-time training duty, annual training duty, full-time
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                     103


     National Guard duty, and attendance, while in the active service, at a school designated
     as a Military Service school by law, or by the Secretary concerned.
     7.8.1.2. Extended Active Duty (EAD). Extended Active Duty is defined as active duty
     performed by a member of a Reserve Component when strength accountability passes
     from the Reserve Component to the active military establishment.
     7.8.1.3. Inactive Duty (IAD). Inactive duty includes the following pay categories:
     Training Period (TP), Unit Training Assembly (UTA), Equivalent Training (ET),
     Additional Flying Training Period (AFTP), Additional Ground Training Period (AGTP),
     and Readiness Management Period (RMP).
     7.8.1.4. Duty Status Codes (DSC): Use Duty Status Codes to indicate the status of
     flying duty performed by the aircrew member. DSC 1 = Active Duty, DSC 2 = Unit
     Training Assembly (Inactive Duty), DSC 3 = Flying Training Period (Inactive Period),
     DSC 4 = Civilian/Technician, and DSC 5 = Contractor.
     7.8.1.5. Incentive Pay Entitlement. Aircrew members of the Reserve Components are
     entitled to flying incentive pay during periods of military duty if serving under competent
     orders and otherwise meeting the requirements of the DoDFMR. Members entitled to
     incentive pay will be compensated for one-thirtieth of the monthly rate for each
     day/period of duty (ARC members may be paid for up to two inactive duty (IAD) periods
     in a calendar day).
     Note: every calendar month is considered 30 days. Reference the example below: (T-0)
     Example: Member performs 4 days/periods of IAD and 3 days of AD during the month;
     daily incentive pay rate equals $840/30 ($28); member’s incentive pay entitlement for the
     month equals $196.
  7.8.2. Determining an aircrew member’s status (IAD/AD). Unless an aircrew member
  performs in an active duty pay status during the month, consider the member in inactive
  status for the entire 30 days. For example, a member performed 10 days of active duty
  during the month of April. The remaining 20 days are considered to be inactive duty status
  (30 days – 10 days = 20). (T-0)
     7.8.2.1. The individual attendance calendar is a computer generated report provided by
     the RPO. It is used to accurately determine the members pay status. Reference the
     example below: (T-0)
 104                                                              AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


Figure 7.21. Attendance Calendar Example.




       7.8.2.2. Flying Time Crediting Criteria. Flight time accrued while in DSC 1, 2, or 3
       may be used to meet flight time requirements. (T-0)
       7.8.2.3. Non-crediting Criteria.       Flight time accrued in a civilian, technician,
       contractor, or ANG state activities pay status cannot be used to satisfy the flight time
       requirements for military incentive pay. (T-0)
   7.8.3. Minimum Flight Time Requirement. ARC minimum flight time requirements are
   one-half of those prescribed for a member on active duty. When a member performs active
   duty during the month, the member incurs an active duty flight time requirement. (T-0)
   7.8.4. Fractions of a Calendar Month. Prorate flight requirements when the member is
   placed on flying status for part of a month or removed from flying status before the end of
   the month. When starting an aircrew member’s flight incentive pay, prorate flight time
   requirements based on the number of days the member was on flying status. Reference the
   Fraction of a Calendar Month Table for prorating flying hour requirements below: (T-0)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                     105

   7.8.5. Order of Application of Flying Hours for Conditional Entitlement. Reference
   paragraph 7.8.8 for IAD application rules and paragraph 7.8.9 for AD application rules. (T-0)
   7.8.6. Banking Active Duty and Inactive Duty Flying Hours. Active duty hours may be
   banked only if the member is on continuous orders for more than 30 days or if the AD period
   extends unbroken over parts of two months. Banked IAD time may be used in the five
   succeeding months. (T-0)
 106                                                              AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


   7.8.7. Combined Flight Requirements. Apply flight time in the category earned first.
   When a member performs both AD and IAD in the same month, all flight time earned may
   be combined to satisfy both AD and IAD monthly flight time requirements. Flight time
   accrued in excess of the monthly requirement will be applied in the order of application for
   the category in which it was earned. (T-0)
   7.8.8. Inactive Duty (IAD) Hours Application Rules. (T-0)
       7.8.8.1. First, IAD hours must be applied to the IAD requirement in the current month.
       Reference the example below where Jan is the current month: (T-0)

Figure 7.23. Combined Flight Requirements Step 1 Example.




          7.8.8.1.1. Second, if insufficient flight time was accrued to satisfy the IAD
          requirement, apply insufficient IAD hours to the current month’s AD requirement.
          Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.24. Combined Flight Requirements Step 2 Example.




          7.8.8.1.2. Third, apply the insufficient IAD and insufficient AD hours to the current
          month’s IAD requirement. Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.25. Combined Flight Requirements Step 3 Example.




          7.8.8.1.3. Fourth, apply the current month’s insufficient IAD and insufficient AD
          hours plus the IAD banked hours to the current month’s IAD requirement. Reference
          the example below: (T-0)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                       107


Figure 7.26. Combined Flight Requirements Step 4 Example.




   7.8.9. Active Duty (AD) Hours Application Rules. (T-0)
      7.8.9.1. First, apply AD hours to the AD requirement in the month earned. Reference the
      example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.27. AD Hours Application Rules Step 1 Example.




      7.8.9.2. Second, apply the current month’s insufficient/excess AD hours to the current
      month’s IAD requirement. Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.28. AD Hours Application Rules Step 2 Example.




      7.8.9.3. Third, apply the current month’s insufficient AD and excess/insufficient IAD
      hours to the current month’s AD requirement.
      Note: The AD requirement will always be satisfied before the IAD requirement if the
      IAD requirement is not met. Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.29. AD Hours Application Rules Step 3.




      7.8.9.4. Fourth, apply the current month’s insufficient AD hours plus the insufficient
      IAD hours to the current month’s IAD requirement. Reference the example below: (T-0)
 108                                                             AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


Figure 7.30. AD Hours Application Rules Step 4.




       7.8.9.5. Fifth, apply the insufficient AD hours plus any AD banked hours to the AD
       requirement.
       Note: Active duty hours may be banked only if the member is on continuous orders for
       more than 30 days or if the AD period extends unbroken over parts of two months.
       Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.31. AD Hours Application Rules Step 5.




   7.8.10. Grace Periods. In addition to the examples below, reference paragraph 7.5. of this
   instruction. (T-0)
       7.8.10.1. Entering a grace period when initially placed on status. Reference the
       example below. (T-0)

       7.8.10.2. Two-month grace periods. Reference the example below. (T-0)
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                       109


Figure 7.33. Two-month Grace Period Example.




      7.8.10.3. Three Month Grace Period. Reference the example below. (T-0)

Figure 7.34. Three-month Grace Period Example.




      7.8.10.4. When a new grace period may begin. When a member fails a three-month
      grace period, a new grace period cannot begin until flight requirements have been
      satisfied for one month after the failed grace period. (T-0)
      7.8.10.5. No Flight Activity Performed in the First or Second Month. When a
      member does not accrue flight time during the first two months of a three month period,
      the member must satisfy the total aerial flight requirement by the end of the third month
      (including banked time prior to grace period) to be entitled to pay for all three months. If
      the member accrues 2 or more hours, but less than the total flight time requirement
      (including banked time), the member is entitled to pay for the third month only, because
      the member did not perform flight activity in the first and second months. When no
      flight activity is performed during the first two months of a grace period, banked time
      (prior to grace period) may be used only if the entire three-month requirement is satisfied.
      Reference the example below: (T-0)
 110                                                            AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


Figure 7.35. No Flight Activity Performed in the First or Second Month Example.




       7.8.10.6. No Flight Activity Performed in the First and Third month. When a
       member does not accrue flight time during the first and third month of a three month
       period and accrues 4 hours in the second month, the member is entitled to pay for the
       second month only. Reference the example below: (T-0)

Figure 7.36. No Flight Activity Performed in the First or Third Month Example.




       7.8.10.7. Active Duty Banking Rules. Active duty flight time can be banked only when
       a member is on continuous orders for more than 30 days (reference example 1 below) or
       if the AD period extends unbroken over parts of two months; reference example 2 below
       for Captain Slyder. (T-0)

            HAZARDOUS DUTY INCENTIVE PAY (PARACHUTIST DUTY)

8.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes Air Force policy for management of Hazardous Duty
Incentive Pay (HDIP) for Parachute Duty and supplements provisions of DoDFMR 7000.14R,
Volume 7A, Chapter 24.
8.2. Waiver Criteria. This chapter includes (T-0) and (T-1). Note: This chapter expands the
‘how to’ validate and verify entitlement to pay and perform MPO actions. The primary directive
to apply and credit flight time is the DoD Financial Management Regulation.
8.3. Entitlement to HDIP for Parachutists. Members must satisfy the provisions of this
instruction and other applicable guidance as they pertain to parachutists’ HDIP entitlement. (T-0)
Note: P.L. restricts CEAs from receiving parachute incentive pay. (T-0)
   8.3.1. Entitlement is authorized when the member satisfies the following prerequisites: (T-0)
       8.3.1.1. On competent orders: To be entitled to HDIP, qualified parachutists must have a
       current AO authorizing performance of parachute duty. When a member becomes
       Military Freefall (MFF) qualified, publish an AO to authorize MFF duties, and parachute
       duty Type 2 HDIP. The effective date of the AO is the basis for determining entitlement
       to incentive pay. Inactive, suspended, or disqualified parachutists will not receive HDIP.
       (T-0)
       8.3.1.2. Assigned to a valid UMD authorization: A member must be assigned to a valid
       “J” prefixed position, or “jump-inherent” DAFSC position. Reference AFI 11-410 for
       guidance pertaining to jump-inherent DAFSCs and excess members assigned to UMD
       positions.
       Exception: “C” or “B” prefixes are authorized for commander and DO billets. AO
       remarks will state that jump requirement has been verified via the AF Form 4322, Active
       Parachutist Justification. (T-1)
       8.3.1.3. Formal Training School: A member enrolled in a formal course of instruction
       leading to the award of the Basic Parachutist rating IAW AFI 11-410 is entitled to HDIP.
       Note: When member returns from school and is assigned to a valid UMD authorization,
       HARM personnel will start the member’s HDIP if otherwise qualified. (T-1)
       8.3.1.4. Do not authorize HDIP entitlement for parachute jumps performed while on
       leave or in PCS status. Do not authorize HDIP entitlement for parachute jumps
       performed while on Temporary Duty (TDY) or Temporary Assignment Duty (TAD) and
       not required as essential part of duty or formal course education and training
       announcements syllabi requirements (including weekends while enrolled in non-jumping
       formal classes). Temporary assignment duty is performed when the member remains on
       base to perform temporary duty; TDY is performed off-station. (T-0)        Note: Dual
       purpose TDY orders must specify the specific date(s) jumping is required as essential to
       the TDY. For example: MSgt Alissa Miller, a qualified jumpmaster departed for TDY
       to Hurlburt Field to attend an Intro to Middle East Course at the Air Force Special
       Operations School during the week of 18-22 Jan. The 720 STG had pre-coordinated a
       manning assistance request for MSgt Miller to perform instruction and jump with a
 116                                                               AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


       special tactics team from 23-24 Jan. MSgt Miller’s TDY orders must specify the dual
       TDY dates in order for jumps performed during the manning assistance period to count
       for entitlement to HDIP. If the manning assistance was not requested and MSgt Miller
       performed the jumps on her accord, the jumps would not be logged on an AF Form
       4323/922 for entry in ARMS and would not count toward HDIP entitlement. Rationale:
       jumping was not essential (required) for the TDY.
8.4. Performance Requirements for HDIP. IAW DoDFMR 7000.14R, Volume 7A, Chapter
24 and as further defined in AFMAN 65-116. There are two types and rates of HDIP for
parachutists. (T-0)
   8.4.1. Static line (Type 1). Authorized for parachute jumps from an aircraft in aerial flight
   when static line procedures are utilized. (T-0)
   8.4.2. MFF (Type 2). Authorized for parachute jumps from an aircraft in aerial flight,
   provided members are in MFF training or have completed Military Freefall School and
   performing freefall jumps (HALO/HAHO) when parachute deployment by the jumper occurs
   without the use of a static line. Members must be specifically required by an AO to perform
   MFF duties. (T-0)
8.5. Performance Requirements. Member must satisfy performance requirements of the
DoDFMR 7000.14R, Volume 7A, Chapter 24, Table 24-3, and the provisions of this instruction
to receive incentive pay. The member must satisfy performance requirements before the HARM
initiates incentive pay action (i.e. a static jump for Type 1 HDIP and MFF jump for Type 2
HDIP). Do not use jumps performed in excess of the minimum monthly requirement for pay
purposes unless Rule 3 guidance applies. (T-0)
   8.5.1. Submit certified documentation (AF Form 922/4323) of all jumps performed in a
   given month to the servicing HARM office by the 5th duty day of the following month.
   SARM personnel will document periods of permissive TDY, leave, and non-jumping
   TDY/TADs to ensure jumps performed during these periods do not count toward members’
   HDIP entitlements and are not entered in ARMS. (T-0)
   8.5.2. Definition of DoDFMR Table 24-3 Rules. In every case discussed below parachute
   performance requirements must be met before payment is made. (T-0)
       8.5.2.1. Rule 1. Member is entitled to pay for a consecutive three-month period based
       on one jump performed. Credit the member for a qualifying jump for the month it was
       performed and: (T-0)
          8.5.2.1.1. Two preceding months or…
          8.5.2.1.2. Two succeeding months or…
          8.5.2.1.3. One      preceding month      and     one      succeeding     month.
          Note: When a member does not jump for a month and is not covered under any other
          rule, Rule 1 will apply.
       8.5.2.2. Rule 2. Initiate a new three-consecutive month period when performance
       requirements      are     met    for     two      consecutive   months.      (T-0)
       Example: A member performed a qualifying jump in January, entitling parachute duty
       pay for January, February and March (month jump was performed plus two succeeding
       months IAW Rule 1). Member performed another parachute jump in February. This
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                    117


     jump entitled the member to HDIP for the new three-consecutive month period. Member
     is now qualified for HDIP through April (Rule 2).
     8.5.2.3. Rule 3 (Waiver). Member may qualify for parachute duty pay for a twelve-
     consecutive month period, based upon the performance of 4 qualifying jumps during a 9-
     month period following a 3-month period when the member did not qualify for parachute
     duty pay due to military operations of the command, absence of jump equipment or
     aircraft, or extenuating circumstances. Inability to perform parachute jump duty due to
     normal operations (e.g. Emerald Warrior, Red Flag, JSET, etc.) or lack of TDY funds is
     not valid reasons for a Rule 3 waiver. (T-0) Approved requests for consecutive Rule 3
     periods for will be info copied to the 1C0 MFM. (T-1)
        8.5.2.3.1. To place a member under the provisions of Rule 3, a letter certified by the
        AF Chief of Staff, MAJCOM Commander, Commander of an Airborne/Parachute
        unit, or the member’s unit commander must be submitted to the servicing HARM
        office. A Rule 3 letter must be submitted no later than 15 duty days after completion
        of the three-consecutive month period when the member did not qualify for parachute
        duty pay due to military operations, lack of parachute equipment or aircraft, or
        extenuating circumstances (See Note below). The letter must state the reason(s) why
        the member could not perform a parachute jump during the three-consecutive
        calendar month period. Rule 3 letter will be filed in JRF. (T-0) Template example of
        ‘Rule 3 Letter’ is located on the Aviation Resource Management SharePoint site at:
        https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-85/default.aspx
        Note: Reasons may include periods of “mission related” pre-deployment training for
        major contingency operations (military operations of the command) or extenuating
        circumstances (i.e. weather condition/cancellations, range/landing zone closures).
        8.5.2.3.2. A member in Rule 3 status is not entitled to incentive pay for the initial
        three-month period until he or she performs four qualifying jumps. (T-0)
        Example 1: Member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump during Jan – Mar
        due to military operations of the command. Based off the commander’s Rule 3 letter
        submitted to the HARM office on 10 Apr, the member entered the Rule 3 period
        effective 1 Jan. This member will not receive incentive pay for Jan – Mar until
        he/she performs four qualifying jumps between 1 Apr – 31 Dec (1 Apr to 31 Dec = 9
        months).
        Example 2: Member completed a static jump on 15 Feb, but did not perform a
        qualifying MFF jump from Jan-Mar due to absence of MFF equipment. Based on the
        commander’s Rule 3 letter submitted to the HARM office on 12 Apr, the member
        entered the Rule 3 period for Type 2 effective 1 Jan. The HARM office processed a
        MPO to STOP Type 2 pay effective 31 Dec and REPORT Type 1 pay for Jan-Mar.
        The member is required to perform four qualifying MFF jumps from Apr-Dec to
        receive Type 2 pay for the entire Rule 3 period (to include the rate difference between
        Type 1 and Type 2 for Jan-Mar). If Rule 3 requirements were not met the member
        may be authorized to pay for qualifying jumps performed during the Rule 3 period
        (Revert back to Rule 1, rules of application).
        8.5.2.3.3. During the Rule 3 period HARM office may submit a MPO to authorize
        payment for any period the member satisfied minimum requirements by performing a
        qualifying jump (except the initial period). If at the end of the Rule 3 period the
118                                                           AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


      member met the entire requirement by completing four jumps, the HARM office then
      submits an MPO to authorize payment for the remaining months (including initial
      period) the member was not paid. Revert back to Rule 1 (rules of application) if four
      jumps are not completed. (T-0)
      Example: A member entered Rule 3 effective 1 Jan and performed two parachute
      jumps in Jun and one parachute jump in Jul. The HARM office published an MPO to
      authorize HDIP for Apr, May, and Jun for the jump performed in Jun (month that
      jump was performed plus two preceding months (Rule 1)), and Jul, Aug and Sep for
      the jump performed in Jul (month that jump was performed plus two succeeding
      months (Rule 1)). If the member performs a fourth parachute jump by the end of
      Dec, (end of twelve-month period), the HARM office will publish an MPO to
      authorize HDIP for the remaining months of the Rule 3 period (Jan, Feb, Mar, Oct,
      Nov, and Dec).
      8.5.2.3.4. The member is entitled to the pay based on which type/number of jumps
      accomplished. Award the member the highest rate of pay they are entitled based off
      jumps performed (i.e. static jump for Type 1 HDIP and MFF jump for Type 2 HDIP).
      (T-0)
      Example 1: Member performs two static jumps and two MFF jumps: Member is
      entitled to six months of Type 1 HDIP and six months of Type 2 HDIP.
      Example 2: Member performs three static jumps and one MFF jump: Member is
      entitled to nine months Type 1 HDIP and three months Type 2 HDIP.
      Example 3: Member performs three static jumps and three MFF jumps: Member is
      entitled to three months Type 1 HDIP and nine months Type 2 HDIP.
      8.5.2.3.5. If a member fails to perform at least four parachute jumps during the
      twelve month Rule 3 period, he/she is not entitled to HDIP for the initial three-
      consecutive month period. The member is entitled to HDIP for the remaining nine
      months based on qualifying parachute jumps performed (revert back to Rule 1). (T-0)
      Example: A member entered Rule 3 effective 1 Jan and performed two parachute
      jumps in Apr and one parachute jump in Jul, but did not perform another parachute
      jump before the end of the twelve-consecutive month period. The HARM office
      published an MPO to authorize HDIP for Apr, May, and Jun for the jump performed
      in Apr (month that jump was performed plus two succeeding months (Rule 1)), and
      Jul, Aug and Sep for the jump performed in Jul (month that jump was performed plus
      two succeeding months (Rule 1)). Because the member did not perform a fourth
      parachute jump during the twelve-consecutive month period, he/she is not entitled to
      HDIP for Jan – Mar (initial three-consecutive month period) or Oct. Nov and Dec
      TBD based on Rule 1, rules of application.
      8.5.2.3.6. Parachute jumps performed in excess of the four parachute jumps required
      to satisfy Rule 3 performance requirements can be carried forward out of the twelve-
      consecutive month Rule 3 period to satisfy minimum performance requirements in
      subsequent months. (T-0)
      Example 1: Member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump during Jan-Mar
      13. Member was placed in Rule 3 effective 1 Jan 13. Member performed one
      parachute jump in Apr 13, two parachute jumps in Aug 13 and two parachute jumps
      in Dec 13. The HARM office published an MPO to authorize HDIP for Apr-Jun 13
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                   119


        based on the parachute jump performed in Apr 13 (performance month plus two
        succeeding months IAW Rule 1). The HARM office published a subsequent MPO to
        authorize HDIP for Jul-Sep 13 based on the two parachute jumps performed in Aug
        13 (performance month plus one preceding month and one succeeding month IAW
        Rule 1). The first parachute jump performed in Dec 13 was the fourth parachute
        jump performed during the twelve-consecutive month period (Jan – Dec 13).
        Therefore, the HARM office published an MPO to authorize HDIP for all remaining
        months in the Rule 3 period, i.e. Jan-Mar 13 and Oct-Dec 13. The HARM office
        published another MPO to authorize HDIP for Jan-Feb 14 based on the second
        parachute jump performed in Dec 13 (performance month plus two succeeding
        months IAW Rule 1).
        Example 2: Look again at the example above. If the member performed one
        qualifying parachute jump in Apr 13, two qualifying parachute jumps in Aug 13 and
        two qualifying parachute jumps in Nov 13 verse Dec 13, the HARM office would
        publish MPOs to authorize HDIP for the entire Rule 3 period (Jan – Dec 13) based on
        the four qualifying parachute jumps performed. The HARM office would publish
        another MPO to authorize HDIP for Jan 14 based on the second parachute jump
        performed in Nov 13 (performance month plus two succeeding months IAW Rule 1).
        8.5.2.3.7. Disqualification (e.g. ASC 07) during a Rule 3 period. A Rule 3 period
        concludes on the day prior to disqualification. Upon return to an active AO, the
        member will revert to standard application of jumps. (T-0)
           8.5.2.3.7.1. If the member completed the four jumps required for the Rule 3
           period prior to disqualification, the member is entitled pay from the beginning of
           the Rule 3 period until the day prior to disqualification. (T-0)
           Example: Member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump for Jan - Mar and
           is granted a Rule 3 waiver from Jan - Dec. The member performed four jumps
           between Apr and Aug. The member was disqualified effective 1 Sep. The
           member is entitled to pay from 1 Jan – 31 Aug.
           8.5.2.3.7.2. If the member performed qualifying parachute jumps but did not
           meet the four jump requirement for the Rule 3 period, the member is entitled to
           pay based on standard application of jumps until the day prior to disqualification.
           (T-0)
           Example: Member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump for Jan - Mar and
           is granted a Rule 3 waiver from Jan - Dec. The member performed one jump in
           Apr and one jump in Aug. The member was disqualified effective 1 Sep. The
           member is entitled to pay for 1 Apr – 30 Jun (Rule 1) and 1 Jul – 31 Aug (Rule 1).
           8.5.2.3.7.3. If the member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump prior to
           disqualification, the member is not entitled to pay for the Rule 3 period. (T-0)
           Example: Member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump for Jan - Mar and
           is granted a Rule 3 waiver from Jan - Dec. The member was disqualified
           effective 1 Sep. The member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump from
           Apr - Aug. The member is not entitled to pay from 1 Jan – 31 Aug.
        8.5.2.3.8. Rule 3 periods may be superseded by Rule 4 only when paragraph 8.5.2.4
        of this instruction applies. The member’s status will revert back to Rule 3 upon
 120                                                               AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


           completion of a Rule 4 period. Use the following Table 8.1 of this instruction to
           prorate the Rule 3 performance requirement (four qualifying parachute jumps) based
           on the length of the Rule 4 period (3, 6, 9, or 12 months). (T-0)

       8.5.2.4. Rule 4 (Waiver). Minimum parachute jump requirements may be waived if a
       member is unable to perform a qualifying parachute jump by reason of being engaged in
       combat operations in a hostile fire area. Commander will submit a Rule 4 waiver letter to
       the HARM office validating the period of the member’s deployment to a hostile fire area.
       IAW AFMAN 65-116V2, commanders will certify all DD Forms 114 associated with
       Rule 4 waivers. For each month that Rule 4 applies, the member will be entitled to HDIP
       at the highest rate of pay the member was qualified to receive during the same period. If
       a member is in a Rule 4 status for at least one day during a given month, parachute jump
       requirements for that month will be waived and member will qualify for HDIP for the
       entire month. Rule 4 terminates the end of the month the member leaves the hostile fire
       area.
       Exception: If the member performed a qualifying jump during the Rule 4 period and as
       a result is under Rule 1 criteria on the date of return from the hostile fire area, normal
       Rule 1 criteria apply. Reference paragraph 8.5.2.4.4 and Example 2.) Do not include
       post deployment leave, emergency leave, ordinary leave or additional TDY days when
       determining Rule 4 termination date. Commanders will submit letter(s) during the Rule 4
       period as needed to ensure HDIP is not interrupted. A new three-month requirement
       period begins the month following return from the hostile fire area. Rule 4 letter will be
       filed in JRF. (T-0) Template examples ‘Rule 4 Letter’ and ‘DD Form 114’ is located on
       the Aviation Resource Management SharePoint site at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-
       OP-AF-85/default.aspx
           8.5.2.4.1. If a member satisfied HDIP requirements for the entire Rule 4 period based
           on qualifying parachute jumps performed before the Rule 4 period began, prepare a
           DD Form 114 (for filing/validation purposes only) with a certifying statement signed
           by the unit commander listing the inclusive periods the member qualified for a Rule 4
           waiver. File the MPO in the member’s JRF for accountability purposes. Because the
           member experienced no interruption in HDIP and the finance office was not involved,
           include a remark stating “no CMS case required.” (T-0)
           Example: A member performed a qualifying parachute jump on 15 Jan.
           Commander submitted a Rule 4 letter for 1 Feb – 31 Mar. Because HDIP entitlement
           for Feb and Mar is satisfied by the qualifying parachute jump performed 15 Jan, the
           HARM office prepared a DD Form 114 listing the period requirements were met (1
           Feb – 31 Mar) with a certifying statement signed by the commander. A new three-
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                   121


        consecutive month period began effective 1 Apr and the member’s status reverted to
        Rule 1.
        8.5.2.4.2. If a member satisfied HDIP requirements for a portion of the Rule 4 period
        based on qualifying parachute jumps performed before the Rule 4 period began,
        prepare a DD Form 114 (for filing/validation purposes only) with a certifying
        statement signed by the unit commander for the period parachute jump requirements
        were met. The HARM office will process a separate DD Form 114 (for
        filing/validation purposes only) with a certifying statement signed by the unit
        commander for each month that the member did not meet parachute jump
        requirements in Rule 4 status based on the commander’s letter. File the MPOs in the
        member’s JRF for accountability purposes. Because the member experienced no
        interruption in HDIP and the finance office was not involved, include a remark stating
        “no CMS case required.” (T-0)
        Example: A member performed a qualifying parachute jump on 15 Jan.
        Commander submitted a Rule 4 letter for 1 Feb – 30 Jun. Because HDIP entitlement
        for Feb and Mar is satisfied by the qualifying parachute jump performed on 15 Jan,
        the HARM office prepared a DD Form114 listing the period requirements were met
        (1 Feb – 31 Mar) with a certifying statement signed by the commander. The HARM
        office then processed a separate DD Form 114 for each month (Apr, May, and Jun)
        with a certified statement signed by the commander. A new three-consecutive month
        period began effective 1 Jul and the member’s status reverted to Rule 1.
        8.5.2.4.3. If the member was not entitled to HDIP at the beginning of the Rule 4
        period due to non-performance of parachute jumps but is otherwise qualified to
        receive HDIP, the HARM office will process a separate DD Form 114 with a
        certifying statement signed by the unit commander for each month that the member is
        in Rule 4 status based on the commander’s letter (Example 1).
        Exception: If the commander submitted the Rule 4 letter after the member returned
        from a hostile fire area, the HARM office will process a DD Form 114 with a
        certifying statement signed by the unit commander for the inclusive periods the
        member qualified for a Rule 4 waiver (Example 2).) Do not start member’s HDIP
        until receipt of the commander’s letter certifying the Rule 4 period. (T-0)
        Example 1: A member’s HDIP entitlement was terminated in Jan for failure to
        satisfy parachute jump requirements. The member did not perform a parachute jump
        in Feb before deploying to a hostile fire area from 10 Feb to 5 Jun. Upon receiving
        the commander’s Rule 4 letter, the HARM office processed a separate DD Form 114
        for each month (Feb, Mar, Apr, May, and Jun) with a certifying statement signed by
        the commander. A new three-consecutive month period began effective 1 Jul and the
        member’s status reverted to Rule 1.
        Example 2: A member’s HDIP entitlement was terminated in Jan for failure to
        satisfy parachute jump requirements. The member did not perform a parachute jump
        in Feb before deploying to a hostile fire area from 10 Feb to 5 Jun. Upon the
        member’s return from the deployment, their commander submitted a letter validating
        the member qualified for a Rule 4 waiver during the entire deployment period. The
        HARM office processed one DD Form 114 for the entire period (1 Feb – 30 Jun) with
 122                                                               AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


          a certifying statement signed by the unit commander. A new three-consecutive
          month period began effective 1 Jul and the member’s status reverted to Rule 1.
          8.5.2.4.4. If the member performed a qualifying parachute jump in Rule 4 status, the
          member reverts to Rule 1 status based on qualifying parachute jump(s) performed.
          HDIP entitlement was satisfied under Rule 4 criteria from the beginning of the Rule 4
          period through the month prior to the parachute jump. If the member remained in the
          hostile fire area after the period HDIP entitlement was satisfied by parachute jump
          requirements, their status will revert back to Rule 4. (Example 1) If the member
          departed the hostile fire area while in Rule 1 status, normal Rule 1 criteria applies.
          (Example 2). (T-0)
          Example 1: Commander submitted a Rule 4 letter for 1 Jan–31 Jul. Member
          performed a qualifying parachute jump on 15 Apr. HDIP entitlement for Jan, Feb,
          and Mar was satisfied under Rule 4 criteria, and the parachute jump performed on 15
          Apr satisfied HDIP requirements for Apr, May, and Jun under Rule 1 criteria.
          Assuming the member did not perform a qualifying parachute jump after 15 Apr, the
          member’s reverted back to Rule 4 from 1 Jul – 31 Jul.
          Example 2: Commander submitted a Rule 4 letter for 1 Jan – 31 Jul. Member
          performed a qualifying parachute jump on 15 May. HDIP entitlement for Jan, Feb,
          Mar, and Apr was satisfied under Rule 4 criteria, and the parachute jump performed
          on 15 May satisfied HDIP requirements for May, Jun, and Jul under Rule 1 criteria.
          The member returned to home station on 31 Jul while in Rule 1 status and a new
          three-month period began effective 1 Aug.
       8.5.2.5. Rule 5. The month a member enters training or reports for duty is considered
       the      first    month        of    the      three-consecutive      month       period.
       Note: The HDIP entitlement for fractions of a month(s) will be prorated to coincide with
       the number of days on status. (T-0)
          8.5.2.5.1. If a member is static line qualified and subsequently enters MFF training,
          he or she will receive MFF pay from date entered training forward based on
          performance of MFF jumps. Because the member was previously static line
          qualified, a MFF jump may satisfy requirements for static pay for the period prior to
          beginning MFF training. (T-0)
          Example 1: Member entered MFF training effective 4 Apr. Member performed a
          MFF jump on 11 Apr. IAW Rule 5, this jump satisfied MFF HDIP requirements for
          4 Apr to 30 Jun. Additionally, this MFF jump could have been used to authorize
          static line HDIP for 1-3 Apr if necessary (period prior to start of MFF training).
          Example 2: Member entered MFF training effective 4 Apr. Member performed
          MFF jumps in Apr and May. In this scenario, the Apr jump satisfied MFF HDIP
          requirements for 4 - 30 Apr. The MFF jump performed in May started a new three-
          consecutive month period (Rule 2) and this jump satisfied MFF HDIP requirements
          for 1 May – 31 Jul. Accordingly, IAW Rule 1 the MFF jump performed in Apr could
          have been used to authorize static line HDIP for 1 Feb – 3 Apr (current month plus
          two preceding months).
8.6. Incentive Pay Effective Dates.
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                      123


  8.6.1. Start Dates. The start date for HDIP will be based on the ASC effective date and no
  earlier than: (T-0)
     8.6.1.1. …the class start date for those placed on orders to attend a formal training course
     leading to the award of the parachutist badge.
     Note: Members will be entitled to MFF (Type 2) pay effective the class start date of
     Military Freefall School provided MFF performance requirements are satisfied. (T-0)
     8.6.1.2. …the effective date of the AO when performance requirements are satisfied
     within three-consecutive months of the AO effective date. First, apply jumps to satisfy
     requirements backward towards the start date of an AO/requirement, regardless of how
     many days the member is on jump status in a month. (T-0)
     Example: Member is placed on status 15 Jan and performs a jump before the end of
     Mar. The effective date of the MPO is 15 Jan (date placed on status). Based on this
     jump, the member satisfied HDIP requirements for 15 Jan – Mar. AFI 11-401 establishes
     criteria on AO effective dates and when the entitlement begins.
     8.6.1.3. the first eligible month the member qualified for HDIP when the first jump is not
     performed       within     the   initial  three-consecutive    month    period.     (T-0)
     Example: Member is placed on status 15 Jan and performs the first jump in Apr. The
     effective date of the MPO will be 1 Feb and the member is entitled to HDIP for Feb –
     Apr (Rule 1, current month plus two preceding months).
     8.6.1.4. Incentive Pay Effective Dates for Rule 3 Periods. The member will not
     receive HDIP for any month in the initial three-consecutive month period until he/she
     performs four qualifying jumps; and the four jumps must be performed within the
     additional nine-consecutive month period.
     Note: HDIP is authorized for any month other than the initial three-consecutive month
     period when performance requirements are satisfied. Upon completion of the fourth
     jump, the member is entitled to HDIP for all twelve months. (T-0)
     Example: Member is placed in Rule 3 effective 1 Mar and performed a jump on 15 Jun.
     The HARM office submitted an MPO on 1 Jul to authorize HDIP for 1 Jun – 31 Aug
     (Rule 1, current month plus two succeeding months). Member performed three parachute
     jumps on 15 Oct. Because the member performed at least four jumps during the Rule 3
     period, the HARM office submitted an MPO to authorize HDIP for the initial three-
     consecutive month period (1 Mar – 31 May) and the remainder of the twelve month Rule
     3 period (1 Sep – 28 Feb). On the final MPO, the HARM office will list inclusive
     periods member was previously paid during the twelve month period.
     8.6.1.5. Incentive Pay Effective Dates for Rule 4 Periods. HDIP pay is effective the
     first day of the month of deployment to a hostile fire area. (T-0)
     8.6.1.6. When a MFF qualified parachutist performs MFF jumps to qualify for Type 2
     for a period when the member was previously authorized Type 1 HDIP (static line), the
     member will be entitled to the difference of the two rates. (T-0)
     Example: A MFF qualified member performed a static line jump on 15 Mar and was
     authorized Type 1 HDIP for 1 Jan – 31 Mar based on the static line jump. This member
     performed a MFF jump on 10 Apr. He/she was now entitled to Type 2 HDIP for Feb –
     Apr based on the MFF jump (Rule 1, current month plus two preceding months).
     Because the member already received Type 1 HDIP for Feb and Mar based on the
 124                                                              AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


       previous static line jump, he/she will receive the difference between Type 1 and Type 2
       HDIP for Feb and Mar. HARM personnel will submit an MPO action to change the rate
       of pay form Type 1 to Type 2 from 01 Feb – 31 Mar.
   8.6.2. Termination Dates. Terminate incentive pay when member fails to satisfy minimum
   performance requirements. (T-0)
   Example: A member is placed on jump status 15 Jan and performed one qualifying jump on
   21 Jan. Based on this jump the member is entitled to HDIP for 15 Jan – 31 Mar (Rule 1,
   current month plus two succeeding months). However, the member did not perform a
   qualifying jump during Feb – Jun. The HARM office processed MPOs to collect HDIP 1-30
   Apr and 1-31 May previously. On 5 July the HARM office processes a MPO to terminate
   HDIP effective 31 Mar. HARM personnel will review jump performance each month and
   process MPOs to pay the member for previous months as required (pay was terminated on 31
   Mar). Reference 8.8.1.2 of this instruction for jump grace period rules.
   8.6.3. Member is disqualified, suspended, or removed from active jump position assignment.
   The HARM office will take action to terminate HDIP effective one day prior to
   disqualification/suspension AO or the last day the individual is assigned to an active jump
   position. A stop pay action provides payment to the member through midnight of the pay
   stop date. If a member was suspended and suspension is later revoked, the member may be
   entitled to HDIP for the suspension period based on qualifying parachute jumps performed.
   (T-0)
   Example 1: The HARM office processes an AO to assign ASC 06 effective 15 Jun. This
   AO terminates entitlement to HDIP. The pay stop effective date is 14 Jun (last day member
   was assigned to the active jump position).
   Example 2: Member performed a jump on 15 Jan which entitled him to pay for Jan, Feb and
   Mar. On 19 Feb, the HARM office processed an AO assigning ASC 07, Failure to Maintain
   Medical Certification, and terminated HDIP effective 18 Feb. On 25 Feb, the HARM office
   processed an AO assigning ASC 9E. The jump that was accomplished on 15 Jan entitled the
   member to HDIP from 1 Jan to 18 Feb. The member entered a grace period effective 25 Feb.
       8.6.3.1. Provide notice as soon as possible to members before removal from an active
       jump position. The 120-Day notification policy prescribed in AFI 11-402 does not apply
       to parachutists. (T-0)
   8.6.4. Member is placed under Rule 3 criteria. The HARM office will take action to
   terminate HDIP effective the last day of the month prior to the initial three-consecutive
   month period. (T-0)
8.7. Conditions of Entitlement.
   8.7.1. Incapacitation. When a member is incapacitated as a result of performing hazardous
   duty and minimum jump requirements have been satisfied for the month in which the
   incapacitation occurred, the member is entitled to HDIP until the recovery date as deemed by
   the appropriate medical authority or a three-consecutive month period beginning the month
   following the month in which the incapacity occurred, whichever occurs first. (T-0)
       8.7.1.1. When incapacity occurs as a result of performing hazardous duty and minimum
       jump requirements have not been satisfied for the month, the member is entitled to HDIP
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                       125


      for a three-consecutive month period beginning with the month in which the incapacity
      occurred. (T-0)
      8.7.1.2. When a member receiving HDIP as a result of incapacity resulting from
      hazardous duty is reassigned to an inactive position or receives PCS orders, HDIP
      continues through the end of the three-consecutive month period. (T-0)
      Example: A parachutist student was placed on 9E orders for the duration of the
      Airborne Course effective 10 May. During the course the member performed a
      qualifying jump on 20 May. On 25 May the member became incapacitated while
      performing a jump and was disenrolled from the course. The member is entitled to
      received HDIP for May and the three-consecutive months (1 Jun - 31 Aug). (T-0)
   8.7.2. Concurrent Entitlement. Pararescue personnel assigned to an active flying position
   (ASC 9D) may be entitled to HDIP for both parachute duty and flying duty. Rated officers
   assigned to a valid jump position may be authorized both ACIP and parachute duty pay.
   Members must satisfy requirements for each entitlement separately. (T-0)
8.8. Monthly Jump Pay Entitlement Verification.
   8.8.1. ARMS Jump Pay Control Document. Use the ARMS Jump Pay Control Document
   in conjunction with the AF Form 1521 ARMS Individual Jump Pay Entitlement Worksheet to
   monitor monthly entitlement to parachute duty pay IAW the DoDFMR. (T-1)
      8.8.1.1. Complete the AF Form 1521 ARMS Individual Jump Pay Entitlement Worksheet
      IAW the instructions on the reverse side of the form and maintain the document
      permanently in the JRF. (T-1)
      Note: The HARM office may keep all worksheets for active jump records in a suspense
      binder until the member departs via PCS, is placed in inactive status, separates or retires.
      (T-1)
      8.8.1.2. HARM personnel will enter parachutists who fail to satisfy minimum parachute
      jump performance requirements for a given month into a three-consecutive month jump
      grace period. If at the end of the three-consecutive month period the member satisfied
      performance requirements for the first month, no pay action is required. If at the end of
      the three-month jump grace period performance requirements were not satisfied, pay
      action is required to collect (stop and start) HDIP for the first month only; because
      requirements can no longer be satisfied for that month. A new three-month jump grace
      period will begin the next month that the member did not meet requirements within a
      three-month period. (T-0)
      Note: If a member fails to perform a qualifying parachute jump for five consecutive
      months, HARM personnel shall process an MPO to terminate HDIP effective the last
      calendar day of the last month in which the member qualified for HDIP. Do not submit
      an MPO to restart HDIP until the member performs a qualifying parachute jump (unless
      under a Rule 4 waiver letter). (T-0)
      Example: As of 5 Jul, Captain Dedeaux has not performed a qualifying parachute jump
      since 5 Jan. HARM office processed MPOs to collect HDIP for 1 – 30 Apr and 1 – 31
      May previously. On 5 Jul, HARM personnel processed an MPO to terminate HDIP
      effective 31 Mar. HDIP will not restart until the member performs a qualifying parachute
      jump.
 126                                                                AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


       8.8.1.3. Parachutists that fail to satisfy a three-month jump grace period due to military
       operations of the command, absence of jump equipment or aircraft, or extenuating
       circumstances may be entered into a Rule 3 period. Upon receipt of the Rule 3 letter
       from the commander, HARM personnel shall ensure HDIP is terminated effective the last
       calendar day before the start of the Rule 3 period. (T-0)
       8.8.1.4. As a minimum, HARM personnel shall ensure each month in which Rule 3 or 4
       applies is properly annotated in the “Rule” field on the AF Form 1521. (T-1)
   8.8.2. AF Form 922/4323 Completion. SARM personnel (jump units) or parachutist
   members (when not assigned to a SARM) must ensure the AF Form 922/4323 are completed
   IAW AFI 11-410 and submitted to the HARM office NLT 5 workdays after a month during
   which a qualifying parachute jump was performed. Failure to provide these forms to the
   HARM office delays validation of HDIP entitlement and may cause an interruption in jump
   pay. (T-1)

ARMS User ID’ is located on the Aviation Resource Management SharePoint site at:
https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-85/default.aspx
   9.7.1. User Administration. The purpose of user administration is to provide a means to
   allow Portal Users (Air Force Portal account) access to a specific HARM database. A Portal
   user ID may have access to one or multiple HARM databases, but before a user can get
   access to ARMS they must register through the ARMS User Registration window on the Air
   Force Portal. Once registered, the CHARM shall accept the account or authorize access
   using the Users Administration Screen. CHARMs will validate the user's "need to know"
   prior to authorizing access. Once access is validated the account will be activated and
   privileges granted.
   9.7.2. ARMS External Accounts. The External User Accounts Screen is designed to create
   database-level user accounts for either ad hoc queries users (i.e. Oracle Discoverer) or IRA
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                          129


   (Virtual), users that require/have access directly to the database. It will also serve as the user
   account password administration for database level users. The database user account will
   only have access to one HARM per database user account.
9.8. Ad Hoc Queries (i. e. Oracle Discoverer) Connectivity Pre-deployment Requirements.
   9.8.1. Determine network connectivity at the deployed location if deploying to a new
   location. Network connectivity is essential to the operation of our duties while at a deployed
   locations. The Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) may be from another DoD service
   component, NATO, U.S. Allies or be part of a contractual agreement approved by the
   deployed location commander.
      9.8.1.1. If network connectivity is not established contact the unit computer support
      administrator (CSA), base communications squadron or project officer or NCO to
      establish network support requirements. If local CSA or communications personnel will
      not deploy, contact the OPR at the deployed location to establish network support
      requirements.
      9.8.1.2. For locations where network communication is not available; submit a request to
      the unit CSA or local communications squadron to establish a Remote Access Server
      (RAS) account NLT 45 days prior to deployment.
      9.8.1.3. Use existing forward deployed location’s infrastructure whenever possible. If
      deploying to a base with a servicing HARM office, contact the local CHARM for
      assistance and support.
   9.8.2. Ensure computers contain access to the current version of Oracle run-time.
      9.8.2.1. If necessary, use https://ceds.gunter.af.mil/ to download the Oracle application
      in a deployed location. A username and password will need to be created for this website.
      9.8.2.2. Ensure the deployed location has an approved Firewall Exemption Letter on file
      for the installation of Oracle. If a Firewall Exemption Letter has not been approved,
      contact the unit CSA or local Communications Squadron immediately for processing
      procedures and submit an AFTO Form 265. See ELSG SharePoint for additional
      documentation.

Aircrew—The total complement of rated officers (pilots, combat systems officers, navigators,
air battle managers, and flight surgeons), career enlisted aviators (1AXXX Air Force Specialty
Codes), and non-career officer/non-CEA aviator aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed Air Force
Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft and
onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission
(includes members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an authorized
operational flying position). Individuals will be on aeronautical orders and assigned to an
authorized position according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or
nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft’s basic crew complement, but required for the mission.
Aircrew members perform principal duties inflight and their presence is required for the aircraft
to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be essential to operating the aircraft or
mission systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties essential to the
aircraft’s mission.
Air Force Aircraft—US Government owned or leased aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.
ARMS Advisory Group (AAG)—The AF ARMS Advisory Group (AF AAG) concentrates on
streamlining issues affecting policy, procedures, and standardization of key aviation and
parachute management processes AF-wide. Highlighting and implementing necessary changes
will improve our career field's efficiency & ability to network information across all commands.

The AAG is comprised of a 1C0X2 Chairperson and Vice Chairperson designated by AF/A30
and representative (Primary/Alternate) from each MAJCOM and Formal school Representative.
ARMS Steering Group (ASG)—The AF ARMS Steering Group (AF ASG) concentrates on
issues affecting innovation, policy, and development affecting short-/long-term growth of the
career field and any applicable aviation matters. In addition, the ASG will review and prioritize
all ARMS SCRs; in-turn, provide recommendations to the ARM Functional Review Board. The
ASG is comprised of our Career Field Manager (Chairperson), MAJCOM Functional Managers,
1C0X2 Formal School Representatives, AF AAG and AWG Chairperson(s). Note: The ARM
Functional Review Board is comprised of AF A3O-AI (Chairperson), 1C0X2 Career Field
Manager, MAJCOM 1C0X2 Functional Mangers, ARMS Program Manager, all system module
program managers (i.e. AF Flying Hour Program Manager, AF Sim Utilization Program
Manager, AF Aircrew Force Program Manager, etc.), to include Flying Operations
Representatives supporting leadership at the HAF, MAJCOM, Wing and Squadron levels. The
official charter of the ARM Functional Review Board is maintained by AF/A3O-AI.
ARMS Working Group (AWG)—The AF ARMS Working Group (AF AWG) concentrates on
issues affecting ARMS implementation, technical operation, sustainment, and enhancements.
The AWG collects ARMS SCRs from the group (or base) 1C0X2 ARMS Working and Advisory
Council (AWAC) assigned to their respective MAJCOM. AWACs collect SCRs from ARMS
customers and evaluate requests to ensure suitability for submission to the AWG. The AWG
provides inputs to ARMS long range planning goals for consideration by the ARMS Steering
Group (ASG). Interaction with HQ AF/A3O-AIF ASG, AFPEO EIS/HIJD, 1C0X2 Technical
School Representative, and MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM) is essential. The AWG will
monitor SCR progress, participate in periodic project reviews, and evaluate modification and
new requirement requests. AWG members are primarily responsible for providing AFPEO
EIS/HIJD support with defining requirements for future upgrades to ARMS along with providing
field testing support before ARMS is released for implementation. The AWG is comprised of a
1C0X2 Senior NCO (preferably a Senior Master Sergeant), wing level or below (currently with
active, day to day ARMS job requirements and a current SEI 066), Chairperson and Vice
Chairperson designated by AF/A30. Additional members consist of a representative from 1C0X2
formal schoolhouses, HQ ELSG/BISA (ARMS Advisor), and 1C0X2 Primary/Alternate
representative from each MAJCOM.
Authentication—Evidence by proper signature or seal that a document is genuine and official.
Authorized Aircrew—Aircrew authorized IAW AFI 65-503.
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP)—Incentive pay authorized for rated officers (regular
and reserve) in an aviation career. See AFI 11-401.
Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first aeronautical order to perform flying
duties. For rated officers, this date is set when the member first reports, on competent orders, to
the aviation activity with aircraft assigned in which the officer will receive flight training leading
to an aeronautical rating (e.g. start date of SUPT, SUNT, or UPT-H class or Weapons Systems
Training) or date of commission, whichever is later. For flight surgeons, the ASD equals the date
all requirements for the flight surgeon rating were met, which is normally the date Course
50BY9351 or equivalent was completed. For Air Battle Managers, the ASD is the date the
crewmember enters training at one of five FTU sites (Tinker, Robins, Keesler, Davis-Monthan,
and Geilenkirchen AB). For CEAs, the ASD is set when the member first reports, on competent
AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014                                                                          139


aeronautical orders, to the aviation activity that has aircraft in which the member will receive
flight training leading to CEA status (normally the class start date).
Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)—Enlisted aircrew in AFSCs 1AXXX.
Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP)—Incentive pay for CEAs in an aviation career
as authorized in the NDAA of FY 00 (see AFI 11-401).
Coaching—A coach helps/guides individuals by sharing insights and lessons from their own
experience to conduct recurring training and/or training in general. Coaches may be found inside
or outside of their current organization and not formally appointed as trainers. The purpose of
coaching is to improve the individual's performance on the job. This involves either enhancing
current skills or acquiring new skills.
Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource Management Report—A daily product used
to highlight aviation service code, flying activity code, and API mismatches. Additionally, this
report highlights errors for aircrew and parachutist members without aircrew or jump prefixes on
duty AFSCs yet assigned active flying status codes; missing military pay dates; expired physicals
yet assigned active ASCs; and much more. This report is a tool to help HARM personnel decide
appropriate management actions. This data flows automatically and monthly to Air Staff with or
without errors.
Conditional Entitlement—The requirement for any aircrew member in an aviation career to
meet monthly flying requirements to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
Continuous Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and CEAs in an aviation
career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flying activity.
Continuation Training—The continuation-training program provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground) necessary to maintain proficiency in
the assigned qualification level. Training in which personnel already qualified in their respective
aircrew positions maintain assigned level of proficiency IAW AFI 11-202 and MDS Specific
Instructions.
Flight—For the purpose of this instruction, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
Frequent and Regular—“Frequent and regular” is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two,
term which establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional
ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP. Chapters 22 and 24 set the minimum at four hours for active duty and
Chapters 56 and 57 set the minimum at two hours for ARC per calendar month, or a prorated
share for lesser periods. By itself, the requirement to fly frequently and regularly is not
justification to assign an individual to aircrew or operational support flyer status. There must be a
need to perform in-flight duties.
Gate—Identifies a point in a rated officer’s or CEA’s aviation career at which utilization is
measured according to the ACIA of 74, the ACIA of 89, or NDAA of FYs 96, 99, and 00.
Utilization is measured at the 12th and 18th year of aviation service for rated officers, and 10th,
15th, and 20th year of aviation service for CEAs.
Government Aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
 140                                                                  AFI11-421 10 APRIL 2014


Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel, to include
general officers with over 25 years of aviation service, required to perform in-flight duties on a
frequent and regular basis. Entitlement is conditional.
Instrument Flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, instrument flight is defined as a
flight conducted in conditions that do not permit visual reference to the horizon, ground, clouds
or water.
Military Freefall (MFF)—High altitude military parachute jump (e.g. HAHO / HALO)
performed without the use of a static line. Static-military parachute jump performed with the use
of a static line.
Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for
which an aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols in AFI 11-401) and may consist of an
increment of one or more sorties. For example, a mission may involve several sorties, or in the
case of an in-flight refueling, several missions may be accomplished in one sortie.
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight
officer, whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal
commissioned service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For
flight surgeons, the OSD includes constructive service granted medical officers in the
computation of creditable service for basic pay.
Operational Flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel
(primarily for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic
flying skills are usually maintained for performing assigned duties.
Operational Support Flyer—Any individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require
flying; however, the Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis in
order to perform a specific, essential in-flight duty which a regularly assigned primary or mission
crewmember cannot perform. Duties may include, but are not limited to, in-flight test, operation
or maintenance of aircraft systems or installed equipment. Commanders must authorize and
request the local HARM office to place operational support flyers on aeronautical orders, if the
requirements established in AFI 11-402, chapter 6, are met in order to receive hazardous duty
incentive pay.
Primary Aircrew Member—Personnel comprising the basic crew complement in AFI 65-503.
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on
takeoff or takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when
the aircraft returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are
stopped, or the aircraft is on the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change
is made in the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. A series of practice landings is
considered one sortie; for a series of practice landings, close out the flight after five minutes on
the ground and begin a subsequent flight but do not log a sortie until the final landing. For
