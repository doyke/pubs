SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication changes technical references to AFI 21-101, Maintenance Plans, Scheduling and Docu-
mentation and AF Form 4097, Aircraft Identification Sheet. It also incorporates technical references AFI
21-401, Flight Documentation and T.O. 00-20-1, AFTO Form 781 Series. It further removes any refer-
ence to Maintenance Data Systems Analysis requirements. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.


1. Procedures. After the completion of each sortie generation, the aircraft commander will provide accu-
rate and completed AFTO Form 781, Arms Aircrew Flight Data Document along with an AF Form 4097,
Aircraft Identification Sheet to the de-briefer.
   1.1. The maintenance de-briefer will review all AFTO Forms 781 and AF Forms 4097 for complete-
   ness and identify any missing information or errors for immediate correction. The maintenance
   de-briefer will ensure that the pilot has initialed the AFTO 781 in the appropriated block 38. The
   maintenance de-briefer will deliver the forms to the Maintenance Operations Control Center
   (MOCC). The MOCC, in turn, after further review, will deliver the forms to Plans, Scheduling and
   Documentation (P, S & D).

    1.2. P, S & D Section will:
       1.2.1. Enter all required data from the AFTO 781 into the MIS- GO81system, 9020 program
       (automated debriefing subsystem). PS&D will initial the appropriate block 37 along with placing
       a G081 processing stamp on the AFTO Form 781.
       1.2.2. Verify all entries loaded into the MIS thru the batch job program 67034. The printed 67034
       will be verified to assure that the Aircraft Utilization Report matches the mission numbers and
       flight times listed on the AFTO Form 781 from the previous day. Any error on the AFTO 781 will
       be entered in red and then corrected. The reviewed 67034 will be dated, signed, and filed by the
       reviewer.
       1.2.3. Duplicate the AFTO 781 and file the copy in the appropriate aircraft 781 jacket file. Ensure
       the original AFTO 781 , along with a printed copy of G081/ 8038 program, Aircraft Flight Status
       Data, is delivered to or picked up by Resource Operations.
    1.3. Resource Operations will:
       1.3.1. Verify and compare the AFTO 781 with the flight authorization for any differences. When
       differences occur, Resource Operations will contact PS&D for confirmation and correction to be
       accomplished.
       1.3.2. Forward a copy of the AFTO 781 along with the MIS- G081/ 8038 program to Current
       Operations Management. The original AFTO 781 will be delivered to Aviation Records.
    1.4. Aviation Records will audit reports entered into the Aircraft Resource Management System and
    file the original AFTO 781.
    1.5. Current Operations Flight Management will:
       1.5.1. Compute total flying hours, accrued against the assigned aircraft mission, from the com-
       pleted AFTO 781.
       1.5.2. Validate total flying hours and reconcile with PS&D on a daily basis. Hours must be recon-
       ciled and changes must be completed no later than the fourth calendar day of the following month.
       Any hours accrued after the fourth calendar day will be considered late.
