This instruction implements AFPD 11-2, Flight Rules and Procedures, by providing guidance
and procedures for standard Air Force flying under visual flight rules (VFR). Since aircraft
flight instrumentation and mission objectives are so varied, this instruction is necessarily general
regarding equipment and detailed accomplishment of maneuvers. Individual aircraft flight
manuals, AFI 11-2MDS series publications, and AFTTP 3-3.XX series publications should
provide detailed instructions required for particular aircraft instrumentation or characteristics.
This manual provides both technique and procedures. Text in bold italic is procedure. This
manual, when used with related flight directives and publications, provides the best possible
operating instructions under most circumstances, but it is not a substitute for sound judgment.
Extreme situations may require the pilot to modify procedures for safety or high-priority mission
accomplishment. While pilots are ultimately responsible for the proper conduct of flight, all
aircrew must be knowledgeable of and comply with the guidance contained in this manual.
When crew positions other than the pilot utilize this guidance, they do so as a subset of the
pilot’s overarching responsibility to ensure all tasks are accomplished in accordance with (IAW)
this manual or, where authorized by the pilot in command, in a modified manner. This
publication applies to the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard (ANG) when published
in the ANGIND 2.

NOTE: This manual is designed to complement AFI 11-202, Volume 3 General Flight Rules.
While AFI 11-202V3 instructs WHAT to do, AFMAN 11-217 instructs HOW to do it. In case of
conflict between this manual and AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-202V3 takes precedence.

WAIVERS: In general, waivers are not granted to AFMAN 11-217V2 as this manual describes
procedures and techniques for complying with rules in AFI 11-202V3. Waivers are more
appropriately granted to the rules in AFI 11-202V3. Waivers granted to AFI 11-202V3, also
 2                                                                              AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


apply to corresponding applicable sections of AFMAN 11-217. A separate waiver is not
required. If a MAJCOM desires a waiver to a bold italic procedure in AFMAN 11-217V2 that is
not addressed in AFI 11-202V3, comply with the Waiver and Exemption guidance in AFI 11-
202V3.

NOTE: The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) published by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) is not regulatory. However, it provides information that reflects examples
of operating techniques and procedures that may be requirements in other regulations. The AIM
is not binding on USAF pilots. Furthermore, it contains some techniques and procedures not
consistent with USAF mission requirements, regulatory guidance, waivers, exemptions, and
accepted techniques and procedures. However, the AIM is the accepted standard in the civil
aviation community and reflects general techniques and procedures used by other pilots. Much
information contained in this AFMAN is reproduced from AIM and adapted for USAF use. If a
particular subject is not covered in this AFMAN, FLIP or other USAF regulations, follow
guidance in the AIM (or appropriate host nation publication) unless mission requirements
dictate otherwise.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a new publication and must be completely reviewed. The former AFMAN 11-217V2
dated 6 August 1998, has been renamed AFMAN 11-217 Volume 3, Supplemental Information.

                                            Chapter 1

                          BASIC VISUAL FLIGHT PROCEDURES

1.1. Applicability of AFI 11-202V3 to VFR Flight.
     1.1.1. USAF flight operations are conducted under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) to the
     maximum extent possible. However, there are many missions that require pilots to operate
     under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) including many OCONUS and most USAF rotary wing
     operations. AFI 11-202V3 details procedures for all flights, to include: preflight weather
     briefing requirements, fuel logs, checking Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), flight manual
     requirements, performance computations, and departure, enroute and arrival planning. Flight
     under VFR does not relieve the pilot of the responsibility to comply with requirements in
     AFI 11-202V3.
     1.1.2. Definitions. The following definitions will aid in understanding VFR flight.
        1.1.2.1. Visual Flight Rules (VFR). These are the rules that govern flight using visual
        references. The term ―VFR‖ is also used in the United States to indicate weather
        conditions that are equal to or greater than minimum VFR requirements. In addition, it is
        used by pilots and controllers to indicate the type of flight plan. To conduct flight under
        VFR the weather must be equal to or better than the minimums specified in Table 7.1 of
        AFI 11-202V3.
        1.1.2.2. Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). This is the description of flight
        conditions when flying in the clear. It includes flight on top of the clouds, under the
        clouds, or between cloud layers. These flight conditions are expressed in terms of
        visibility, distance from clouds, and ceiling equal to or better than specified minima.
        1.1.2.3. Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). These are the rules that govern flight with
        reference to instruments. Also, a term used by pilots and controllers to indicate the type
        of flight plan.
        1.1.2.4. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). This is the description of flight
        conditions when flying in the clouds. It does not include flight on top of the clouds, under
        the clouds, or between cloud layers. These flight conditions are expressed in terms of
        visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less than the minima specified for VMC.
        1.1.2.5. VFR-on-top and VFR-over-the-top. VFR-on-top is ATC authorization for an
        aircraft on an IFR clearance to operate at VFR altitudes of their choice in VMC. VFR-
        over-the-top is an aircraft on a VFR flight plan that departs and climbs over the clouds in
        VMC, maintains VMC above the clouds, then descends in VMC and lands.
        1.1.2.6. Special VFR (SVFR). (Ref. AIM Section 4) A set of modified visual flight
        rules that allow civil aircraft and USAF helicopters to enter, depart or operate in Class
        B/C/D/E airspace when weather is less than that required for VFR flight. SVFR
        procedural guidance is published in AFI 11-202V3.
     1.1.3. It is important not to confuse any of these terms or use them inappropriately. Flight
     conditions do not always correspond to the type of flight plan filed. A large portion of USAF
     flying is conducted in VMC under IFR. When flying IFR, the aircraft may be in IMC or
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                    7


   VMC. However, when operating under VFR, it is mandatory to maintain VMC with
   visibility and cloud clearances appropriate to the type of airspace in which the aircraft is
   operating.
   1.1.4. It is also important to understand rules specific to different types of airspace. For
   instance, IFR flight is authorized in Class G (uncontrolled airspace). However, in Class G
   airspace, the pilot-in-command is the clearance authority and is solely responsible for terrain,
   obstacle, and traffic avoidance. See AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1,
   Instrument Flight Procedures, for further explanation of IFR flight in uncontrolled airspace.
1.2. Inadvertent Flight Into IMC While Operating Under VFR. Despite the best planning, it
is possible to inadvertently penetrate IMC while flying under VFR. This is especially true when
flying at night wearing Night Vision Devices. It is a violation of Federal Aviation Regulations
and Air Force policy to fly VFR with less than the required cloud clearances or visibility. If
IMC is encountered while flying VFR, the situation requires immediate corrective action.
Before flying under VFR, USAF pilots must brief actions to be taken in the event of
inadvertent penetration of IMC.
   1.2.1. If IMC is encountered while flying under VFR, USAF pilots will make every effort
   to maintain VMC.
   1.2.2. If IMC is encountered, the pilot’s actions will be dictated by the particular situation
   and the applicable AFI 11-2MDS or AFTTP 3-3.XX series publications. Factors to consider
   include terrain, obstacles, communication requirements or limitations, other air traffic,
   aircraft equipment limitations, crew complement and experience, theater or local procedures,
   flight manual procedures, threat, etc. In the absence of more specific MAJCOM guidance:
       1.2.2.1. Immediately transition to instruments.      AFMAN 11-217V1 details unusual
       attitude recovery procedures.
       1.2.2.2. Begin a climb to the emergency safe altitude (ESA) or an applicable minimum
       IFR altitude. Except in an emergency, do not climb into Class A airspace without an
       IFR clearance.
       1.2.2.3. If possible, exit IMC by changing altitude or heading. Use caution if exiting
       IMC requires a turn towards higher terrain to ensure the aircraft remains above the safe
       altitude for that flight segment.
       1.2.2.4. If VMC cannot be regained, immediately obtain an IFR clearance to avoid
       conflicts with other traffic.
          1.2.2.4.1. When utilizing VFR Flight Following with an air traffic control (ATC)
          facility, contact that agency and inform them of the situation and your intentions.
          1.2.2.4.2. If you are not utilizing VFR Flight Following, consult the enroute chart,
          instrument approach procedure (IAP) chart, sectional chart, enroute supplement, or
          other publication to determine an appropriate ATC frequency for the area. Attempt
          contact with a radar facility (air route traffic control center [ARTCC] or approach
          control). If contact with a radar facility is not possible, attempt to contact a control
          tower or Flight Service Station (FSS). A tower or FSS can relay to a radar facility
          and provide a frequency. If unable to contact a controlling agency, use the
 8                                                     AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


           emergency frequencies of 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz, and consider squawking
           emergency.
       1.2.2.5. Unless a greater emergency exists, theater procedures dictate otherwise, or the
       pilot is not instrument rated, do not squawk 7700. Continue to squawk the appropriate
       VFR code until an IFR squawk is assigned by ATC.
1.3. Pilot Responsibilities. When operating under VFR, the pilot-in-command is responsible
for terrain, obstacle, wake turbulence, and traffic avoidance. The main principle to remember for
flight under VFR is ―see-and-avoid.‖ Limited traffic separation services may be available from
an ATC radar facility for VFR aircraft. See Chapters 4-6 for further information on radar
services for VFR aircraft.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   9

2.1. VFR Flight Planning. VFR flight planning is especially important as there is little time for
in-flight computations. An important part of good mission planning is proper chart preparation.
The most commonly used charts for VFR operations are the Joint Operations Graphic (JOG), the
Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC), and Sectional Aeronautical Charts (commonly called sectionals).
Sectionals may be preferable for VFR planning because they display critical information that
may not be printed on other charts (e.g. airspace boundaries, special use airspace, ATC
frequencies, IFR airways, etc.) Normally, radius of turn procedures are used (route is drawn
taking into account the distance an aircraft covers while it is turning after passing over a turn
point) when drawing the chart, but depending on tactics, airspeed and altitude, other options like
point to point may be applicable. Time elapsed marks and distance remaining marks along the
course line of each leg will aid in dead reckoning. Consult the applicable AFTTP 3-3.XX
manual and MDS-specific directives for procedures specific to your aircraft.
2.2. Dead Reckoning. Dead Reckoning (DR) is the process of estimating position by
calculating where the aircraft will be at a certain time if a planned ground speed and track are
held. Prior to the advent of computerized flight planning and sophisticated on-board navigation
systems, DR was accomplished largely using a DR computer, also known as an E6B flight
computer (Figure 2.1) or ―whiz wheel.‖ For a quick reference guide to flight computer formulas,
see Attachment 3. Consult your flight manual and/or MAJCOM guidance for specific
procedures.

   2.2.1. Dead Reckoning Terms.
      2.2.1.1. True Course (TC). The intended horizontal direction of travel over the surface
      of the earth, expressed as an angle measured clockwise from true north (000°) through
      359°.
      2.2.1.2. Magnetic Variation (VAR). The difference between true north and magnetic
      north. The magnetic variation is annotated on navigational charts, will be different from
      one position on the earth to another, and will vary slightly over time. Figure 2.2. gives an
      example of magnetic variation (isogonic) lines in the CONUS.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                11


Figure 2.2. Magnetic Variation in the CONUS.




      2.2.1.3. Magnetic Course (MC). True course corrected for magnetic variation. As
      shown in Figure 2.3. applying 10° east variation to a true course of 65° results in a
      magnetic course of 55°. (East variation is subtracted and west variation is added to the
      true course. The memory aid ―east is least and west is best‖ helps in applying the correct
      variation.).

Figure 2.3. Applying Magnetic Variation to Find MC.




      2.2.1.4. Course Line. A line between any two points on the route.
      2.2.1.5. Track. The direction the aircraft moves over the ground. If the pilot fails to
      correct for wind, the aircraft’s track will diverge from the course line.
      2.2.1.6. True Heading (TH). The horizontal direction in which an aircraft is pointed in
      relation to true north. The difference between track and TH is caused by wind and is
      called drift.
      2.2.1.7. Groundspeed (GS). The speed of the aircraft over the ground. Normally
      expressed in nautical miles per hour (knots). (Accounts for wind effect on aircraft speed
      across the ground.)
      2.2.1.8. True Airspeed (TAS). The speed of an aircraft relative to the air surrounding it.
      Since the air mass is usually moving in relation to the ground, TAS and GS are seldom
      the same.
      2.2.1.9. Dead Reckoning Position (DR Position). A point in relation to the earth
      established by keeping an accurate account of time, GS, and track since the last known
      position. It may also be defined as the position obtained by applying wind effect and
      VAR to TH and TAS.
   2.2.2. Pilotage. Pilotage is the use of fixed visual references, normally with reference to a
   chart, to navigate. Air Force pilots combine dead reckoning and pilotage to precisely fly a
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                13


  specific course or route to an objective area. The objective area may be a target designated
  for attack, drop zone, landing zone, photo reconnaissance target, etc. A route is usually
  divided into several legs each beginning and ending with a turnpoint. In order to dead reckon
  successfully, skillful pilotage must be employed to accurately discern distance from different
  altitudes, account for differences in landscape appearance due to seasonal changes, and
  correct for variable wind effects on the aircraft flight path.
     2.2.2.1. Estimating Distance. A landmark often falls right or left of course and the pilot
     must estimate the distance to it. While the ability to estimate distance from a landmark
     rests largely in skill and experience, the following methods may be of assistance:
         2.2.2.1.1. Compare the distance to a landmark with the distance between two other
         points as measured on the chart.
         2.2.2.1.2. Estimate the angle between the aircraft and the reference point on the
         ground. The distance in nautical miles from the landmark to the aircraft’s position
         over the ground depends on the sighting angle:
             2.2.2.1.2.1. (60°): horizontal distance = (AGL altitude) x 1.7
             2.2.2.1.2.2. (45°): horizontal distance = AGL altitude.
             2.2.2.1.2.3. (30°): horizontal distance = (AGL altitude) x 0.6
     2.2.2.2. Seasonal Changes. Seasonal changes can conceal landmarks or change their
     appearance. Small lakes and rivers may dry up during the summer. Their outlines may
     change considerably during the wet season. In many areas, the only indication that a
     river exists may be the presence of deciduous trees. Snow can cover up almost all of the
     normally used landmarks. When flying in the winter, it is often necessary to rely on more
     prominent checkpoints, such as river bends, hills, or larger towns. However, due to the
     size of these checkpoints, course control can be somewhat degraded.
     2.2.2.3. Wind Direction. Many times during low level flight, the only way to read the
     wind is from indicators on the surface. On water, if downwind, the leeward side of the
     waves will appear choppy. (e.g. Wind speeds in excess of 20 knots will start to cause
     whitecaps on the surface of lakes.) If upwind, the windward side of the waves will have
     a smoother appearance. In a similar fashion, the leaves on deciduous trees are lighter on
     the underside which will show to windward. The shiny and normally darker side of the
     leaves will be present on the leeward side of the tree. Smoke and blowing dust also
     provide an easy indicator of wind direction.
  2.2.3. Checkpoints/Turnpoints and Course Lines. Checkpoints are landmarks or geographic
  coordinates on a VFR route used to fix the position of the aircraft. A turnpoint is a
  checkpoint at the beginning/end of a route segment. Figure 2.4. shows a typical VFR route
  plotted on a navigational chart. The yellow circles are turnpoints which are connected by
  course lines. In this figure, one of the course lines is not straight. In some situations,
  following certain terrain features will give an aircraft a tactical advantage. There are no
  checkpoints on this example. They are normally used on long course lines to give an
  intermediate position check during that leg of the route.

Figure 2.4. VFR Navigational Chart.




      2.2.3.1. Before fixing each position, look for several related details around each
      checkpoint to make sure it is positively identified. For example, if the checkpoint is a
      small town, there may be a lake to the north, a road intersection to the south, and a bridge
      to the east. In Figure 2.4. the western-most turnpoint can be verified by the presence of
      the large town to the west, a small heliport just to the north, and a group of towers to the
      west-northwest.
      2.2.3.2. Compare the aircraft position to that of the checkpoint to fix the aircraft's
      location. Arrival over checkpoints at planned times is a confirmation of the wind
      prediction and indicates reliability of the predicted track and groundspeed. If the aircraft
      passes near but not over a checkpoint, the planned track was not held. If checkpoints are
      crossed, but not at the predicted time, the planned ground speed was not flown. Prudent
      pilots are quick to observe and evaluate the difference between an anticipated position
      and an actual position. Corrections must be made to maintain the intended course as soon
      as possible. Small errors are cumulative and can quickly result in the pilot becoming lost.
   2.2.4. Chart Reading.
      2.2.4.1. Orient the chart so that the course line on the chart is aligned with the intended
      course of the aircraft and landmarks on the ground appear in the same relative position as
      the features on the chart.
      2.2.4.2. Obtain the approximate position of the aircraft by pilotage. Select an
      identifiable landmark on the chart at or near the aircraft’s estimated position. It is
      imperative to work from the chart to the ground. Identify the landmark selected and fix
      the position of the aircraft. The importance of good pilotage cannot be over emphasized.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                 15


     2.2.4.3. Clock to Map to Ground. To navigate accurately, check the expected time on
     the route segment, select a feature on the chart, and then find it on the ground rather than
     working from the ground to the chart. The chart does not show all the detail that is on the
     ground and one could easily become confused. Checkpoints should be features or groups
     of features that stand out from the background and are easily identifiable. In open areas,
     any town or road intersection can be used; however, these same features in densely
     populated areas are difficult to distinguish.
        2.2.4.3.1. Funneling Features. When possible, find a feature on the chart that leads to
        the turn point. A funneling feature can be a stream, road, power line, railroad, terrain
        feature, etc. that forms a visual boundary and aids in navigating to and identifying the
        turnpoint.
        2.2.4.3.2. When a landmark cannot be seen or is not available at a turn point, make
        the turn at the estimated time of arrival (ETA). Extend the DR position to the next
        landmark and fix the position of the aircraft to make sure the desired course and GS
        are maintained. Remember, the desired magnetic course on any given leg corrected
        for drift is the magnetic heading which will parallel the course line. This will
        minimize departure from the intended track.
     2.2.4.4. Low-level chart reading presents additional challenges. More attention must be
     committed to flight parameters for obstacle avoidance, the lower AGL altitude reduces
     the range of visibility and landmarks pass by rapidly.
     2.2.4.5. Chart Reading at Night. Night navigation comes with certain inherent
     challenges including hazards due to visual illusions. Lighted reference points tend to
     look closer than they actually are at night, large objects in the background can mask
     closer obstacles, darkness adversely affects visual acuity requiring greater use of
     peripheral vision, colored lighting used for chart reading can mask features on the chart,
     etc. It is critical to understand that contrast can change the way landmarks look at night.
     Proper use of cockpit lighting and night vision devices (NVD) enhances night navigation.
     Special caution must be used when operating around ridgelines utilizing high moon
     illumination. Shadowing can make other ridgelines and obstructions extremely difficult
     to see. For a complete discussion on the use and effects of NVDs on night operations,
     reference AFMAN 11-217V3.
     2.2.4.6. Contour Chart Reading. Contours are lines that connect points of equal
     elevation and are the most common method of showing relief features on a chart.
     Contour lines are closer together where the slope is steep and farther apart where the
     slope is gentle. Within the limits of the contour intervals, the height of points and the
     angle of slope can also be determined from the chart.
        2.2.4.6.1. Contour intervals are determined by the scale of the chart, the amount of
        relief, and the accuracy of the survey. Contours may be annotated in feet or meters in
        the chart legend and are frequently labeled with figures of elevation. To further
        accentuate the terrain, a gradient system of coloring may also be employed. The
        lighter colors might be used to show lower areas while darker colors may portray
        higher terrain. (Some charts use an opposite coloring method. Check chart legend
        for an elevation depiction guide.)

           2.2.4.6.2. Military operations usually require the analysis of contour-labeled charts to
           visualize the land. Operationally this is of the utmost importance, whether planning a
           route for a safe flight or determining the best escape from enemy territory.
       2.2.4.7. Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF). The MEF (Figure 2.5.) can be found on
       many chart variations. It is based on the highest point, natural or man-made, within a
       given grid square. The MEF is determined by adding a 300 foot safety margin plus a
       vertical accuracy factor to the highest point in the grid square and then rounding up to the
       next 100 foot increment. This chart feature is particularly useful if maneuvering off
       course. If the position of the aircraft is known, the MEF for the grid square the aircraft is
       in (or will be in if transiting grid squares to a higher MEF) can be used to calculate a new
       MSA or ESA by simply adding the appropriate amount (i.e. 200 feet for an MSA) to the
       MEF.

Figure 2.5. Maximum Elevation Figure.




2.3. Hazards to Low Altitude Navigation. In low-level flight, one should be particularly alert
for obstructions. Hills and mountains are easily avoided if the visibility is good but radio and
television towers, which may extend as much as 2,000 feet or more into the air, often from
elevated ground, are less conspicuous. Even more dangerous, the guy-wires supporting such
towers are virtually invisible. For this reason, pilots should plan to avoid all towers by a
horizontal distance equal to at least the AGL height of the tower. If flying at extremely low
altitudes, power lines should be crossed at poles or towers as the line a pilot sees may not be the
highest one.
   2.3.1. WARNING: Some obstructions may not be shown on aeronautical charts. Update
   the location of obstructions by using the Chart Updating Manual (CHUM), or electronic
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   17


   CHUM (E-CHUM) if using flight planning software. The CHUM lists important changes
   to all current navigation charts, but does not contain manmade obstacles less than 200 feet
   tall. The CHUM and E-CHUM are published twice a year with supplements published
   monthly. Charts will be updated with CHUM or E-CHUM at least once a month unless
   more restrictive MAJCOM guidance exists.
   2.3.2. WARNING: Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than 200
   feet AGL or a change in terrain until it exceeds the chart contour interval. The worst
   situation would occur if a 199-foot obstacle sat on terrain with an elevation just below the
   next higher contour. For a TPC (1:500,000) with a contour interval of 500 feet, this results in
   an uncharted obstacle existing 698 feet above charted terrain. Additionally, the highest spot
   elevation on any given navigation leg may not be the highest terrain as in the case of
   gradually rising elevations. Planners will check both spot elevations and the contour levels
   to determine enroute and minimum safe altitudes.
   2.3.3. CAUTION: Some charts, such as JOG and topographic line maps (TLM) in some
   areas of the world, may depict terrain and obstacle heights in meters instead of feet.
   2.3.4. Uncharted obstacles. If an obstacle is encountered while flying a route that is not
   charted properly, the following list of contacts will ensure future chart editions or CHUM/E-
   CHUM include the obstacle. For Sectionals, contact the FAA at 1 800 626-3677 or email
   them at aerochart@faa.gov. For NGA products, call the CHUM Help Desk at (636) 321-
   5608, DSN 369-5608 (leave message) or email chum@nga.mil.
   2.3.5. WARNING: All charts used for low altitude navigation shall be full color. If
   making color copies, ensure that all colors come through, as some shades of blue and green
   may not transfer, causing some terrain features or obstacles to be deleted. Exception:
   MAJCOMs may approve the use of black and white copies of original mission planning
   charts to enhance navigational capabilities on night vision missions. However, all mission
   planning and chart annotations must be done on original full color charts prior to making
   copies of any type.
2.4. Chart Reading in High Latitudes. Chart reading in high latitudes presents unique
challenges. The nature of the terrain is significantly different, charts are less detailed and less
precise, seasonal changes may alter the terrain appearance or hide it completely from view, and
there are fewer cultural features.
   2.4.1. In high latitudes, there are few distinguishable features from which to determine a
   position. Built-up features are practically nonexistent and the few that do exist are usually
   closely grouped, offering little help when flying long navigation legs. Natural features may
   be limited in variety and are difficult to distinguish from each other. Lakes can seem endless
   in number and identical in appearance. The countless coastal inlets are extremely difficult to
   identify. Recognizable, reliable checkpoints are few and far between.
   2.4.2. Map reading in high latitudes is further complicated by inadequate charting. Some
   polar areas are yet to be thoroughly surveyed. The charts portray the appearance of general
   locales, but many individual terrain features are merely approximated or omitted entirely. In
   place of detailed outlines of lakes, for example, charts often carry the brief annotation,
   ―Many lakes‖. Pilotage is possible, but requires extended effort and keen judgment.
 18                                                    AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


   2.4.3. When snow blankets the terrain from horizon to horizon, pilotage becomes acutely
   difficult. Coastal ice becomes indistinguishable from the land, coastal contours can change
   dramatically, and many inlets, streams, and lakes disappear. Blowing snow may extend to
   heights of 200 to 300 feet and may continue for several days, but visibility is usually
   excellent. However, when snow obliterates surface features and the sky is covered with a
   uniform layer of clouds so that no shadows are cast, the horizon disappears, causing earth
   and sky to blend together. This forms an unbroken expanse of white called whiteout. In this
   complete lack of contrast, distance and height above ground are virtually impossible to
   estimate. Whiteout is particularly prevalent in northern Alaska during late winter and spring.
   The continuous darkness of night presents another hazard; nevertheless, surface features are
   often visible because the snow is an excellent reflector of light from the moon, the stars, and
   the aurora.
2.5. On-Board Navigational Systems.
   2.5.1. Radio aids to navigation (NAVAIDS), inertial navigation systems (INS), flight
   management systems (FMS), global positioning systems (GPS), and other navigation systems
   are required in various combinations for IFR flight. The requirements for VFR flight are
   much less stringent. For a complete discussion on the characteristics and operational
   procedures of NAVAIDS, see AFMAN 11-217V1. For NAVAID requirements under VFR,
   see discussion under each airspace type.
   2.5.2. Although not required for VFR flight in most types of airspace, it is highly
   recommended that pilots use their on-board navigation systems during flight under VFR
   when operational requirements allow. This will maximize situational awareness and enhance
   safety by facilitating the transition to IFR should it become necessary.
2.6. Airspace.
   2.6.1. Airspace in most of the world is divided up into different types and categories,
   including controlled, uncontrolled, and special use.
      2.6.1.1. Pilots must be familiar with the operational requirements for each of the various
      types or classes of airspace. When overlapping airspace designations apply to the same
      airspace, the operating rules associated with the more restrictive airspace designation
      apply.
      2.6.1.2. When operating under IFR, transition from one type of airspace to another is
      generally transparent to the pilot. The IFR clearance is clearance to enter each type of
      airspace as it is encountered and typically no specific clearances will be issued.
      However, when operating under VFR, it is up to the pilot to determine the airspace type,
      operating rules, and equipment requirements, and comply accordingly. Under VFR,
      transitions from one type of airspace to another are not transparent to the pilot, and in
      many cases, require a specific clearance. A thorough understanding of airspace is
      required for VFR flight. During VFR mission planning, pilots must review the route
      and comply with the requirements for each type of airspace to be transited.
   2.6.2. The categories and types of airspace are dictated by:
      2.6.2.1. The complexity or density of aircraft movements;
      2.6.2.2. The nature of the operations conducted within the airspace;
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                19


     2.6.2.3. The level of safety required; and
     2.6.2.4. The national and public interest.
  2.6.3. Generic Airspace Descriptions and Definitions.
     2.6.3.1. Controlled Airspace. A generic term that covers the different classification of
     airspace (Classes A-E) and defined dimensions within which air traffic control service is
     provided in accordance with the airspace classification. NOTE: Class F airspace does
     not exist in the US. Class F airspace is uncontrolled but aircraft operating under IFR will
     still be provided traffic separation. Consult FLIP and host nation aeronautical
     information publication (AIP).
     2.6.3.2. Uncontrolled Airspace. A term that covers all airspace (Class G) not designated
     as controlled airspace.
  2.6.4. Airspace Weather Minimums. Each type of airspace has specific weather minimums
  and cloud clearance requirements for VFR operations. If the weather is less than the
  airspace required weather minimums, pilots must alter route, altitude or destination to
  maintain VFR, fly under IFR or delay until the weather improves. Where applicable,
  helicopter pilots may request SVFR. For rules governing VFR weather minimums, required
  visibilities and cloud clearances, reference AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 7.
  2.6.5. Airspace Classifications and Procedures. This section details the classes of airspace
  (A-G), operational requirements for each, and charting details. (Figure 2.6.)

      2.6.5.1. Class A Airspace.
          2.6.5.1.1. Location. In the National Airspace System (NAS), Class A airspace
          extends from 18,000 feet MSL up to and including FL600. This includes the airspace
          overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles (nm) of the coast of the CONUS and
          Alaska and designated international airspace beyond 12 nm of the coast and Alaska
          within range of domestic NAVAID or ATC radar coverage where domestic
          procedures are applied. O-CONUS, consult appropriate FLIP products (e.g. approach
          plates) for Class A airspace altitudes.
          2.6.5.1.2. Operations Requirements. Except for specific military operations all
          flights in Class A airspace must be conducted under IFR.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                               21


             2.6.5.1.2.1. VFR operations in Class A airspace will be specifically authorized in
             the Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order (ACO), Special Operating
             Instructions (SPINS), Memorandum, or equivalent document. Pilots shall not
             operate under VFR in Class A airspace without authorization from the
             appropriate airspace authority.
             2.6.5.1.2.2. Since VFR flights are not permitted in Class A airspace except for
             unique military operations, there are no standard procedures for operations except
             for adherence to VFR cruising altitudes described in this chapter.
          2.6.5.1.3. Equipment Requirements. Equipment requirements are in accordance with
          IFR.
          2.6.5.1.4. Charting. Class A airspace is not specifically charted.
      2.6.5.2. Class B Airspace.

Figure 2.7. Class B Airspace.




          2.6.5.2.1. Location. Class B Airspace (Figure 2.7.) is generally from the surface to
          10,000 feet MSL surrounding the busiest (primary) airports in the NAS. The
          configuration of each Class B area is individually tailored and consists of a surface
          area and two or more layers which are sometimes described as ―an upside down
          wedding cake‖. Class B airspace contains all published instrument approach
          procedures for the primary airport as well as all secondary airports.
             2.6.5.2.1.1. Operations Requirements. Pilots must obtain an ATC clearance to
             enter Class B airspace even when operating VFR. Unless otherwise authorized
             by ATC, all large turbine-engine powered aircraft operating to or from the
             primary airport must operate at or above the floor of the Class B airspace when
             operating within its lateral limits.
             2.6.5.2.1.2. When flying VFR, before entering Class B airspace, contact ATC
22                                             AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


     on the appropriate frequency with reference to geographical fixes shown on
     sectional charts. For example, ―SOCAL Approach, PROPS 74, VFR at 13,500
     approaching Santa Anita Racetrack from the north, request clearance to proceed
     VFR to Santa Monica for landing.‖
     2.6.5.2.1.3. When departing VFR from an airport within Class B airspace,
     obtain a VFR clearance from clearance delivery or ATC. Advise the controlling
     agency of the intended direction of flight and altitude. For example, ―DULLES
     Clearance, MUSEL 08, VFR to Shenandoah Regional, request VFR departure to
     the southwest at 4,500 over Casanova.‖
     2.6.5.2.1.4. ATC will normally advise VFR aircraft when leaving the
     geographical limits of the Class B airspace. Radar service is not automatically
     terminated when leaving Class B airspace unless the controller specifically states
     ―Radar service terminated‖.
     2.6.5.2.1.5. Aircraft transiting the Class B airspace and not landing at the primary
     airport may obtain a clearance to do so when traffic conditions permit. When
     transiting the lateral limits of Class B airspace it is encouraged to operate above or
     below the Class B airspace limits, or use published VFR corridors. VFR corridors
     are published on Terminal Area Charts. NOTE: When operating in a published
     VFR corridor, pilots are urged to exchange position information on VHF 122.75.
     2.6.5.2.1.6. VFR aircraft are provided sequencing and separation from all other
     aircraft while operating in Class B airspace. These services are not available in
     the event of radar outage. This does not relieve pilots of their responsibilities to
     see and avoid other traffic, wake turbulence, terrain, obstacles, or IMC. If any
     change to route or altitude is required due to these conditions, inform ATC and
     obtain an amended clearance.
     2.6.5.2.1.7. ATC may assign altitudes to VFR aircraft that are not in accordance
     with the standard VFR cruising altitudes. "Resume appropriate VFR altitudes"
     will be broadcast when the altitude assignment is no longer needed for separation
     or when leaving Class B airspace.
     2.6.5.2.1.8. There are several Special Federal Aviation Regulations (SFAR) in 14
     CFR Part 91 that may be applicable to military VFR operations. Examples
     include operations around large airports in Class B airspace, special events, and
     specific locations like the Grand Canyon or Washington D.C. Federal Aviation
     Regulations are contained in Title 14 of the U.S. Government Code of Federal
     Regulations (14 CFR) and may be viewed and searched electronically at
     http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies.        Consult appropriate federal
     regulations for the latest SFAR provisions prior to flight in these areas.
     2.6.5.2.1.9. Proximity operations. VFR aircraft operating in proximity to Class B
     airspace are cautioned against operating too closely to the boundaries, especially
     where the floor of the Class B airspace is 3,000 feet or less or where VFR cruise
     altitudes are at or near the floor of higher levels. Observance of this precaution
     will reduce the potential for encountering an aircraft operating at the altitudes of
     Class B floors. Additionally, VFR aircraft are encouraged to utilize VFR
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                               23


             Planning Charts as a tool for planning flight in proximity to Class B airspace.
             Charted VFR Flyway Planning Charts are published on the back of VFR Terminal
             Area Charts.
          2.6.5.2.2. Equipment Requirements. Aircraft must have an operable two-way radio
          and transponder with Mode C to operate in Class B airspace. Additionally, all
          aircraft operating within 30 nm of the airports listed in Appendix D, 14 CFR Part 91
          between the surface and 10,000 feet must have an operable transponder with Mode C.
          Pilots will ensure their aircraft is properly equipped prior to entering Class B
          airspace.
          2.6.5.2.3. Charting. Class B Airspace is charted on Sectional and VFR Terminal
          Area Charts.
      2.6.5.3. Class C Airspace

Figure 2.8. Class C Airspace.




          2.6.5.3.1. Location. Generally, Class C airspace (Figure 2.8.) is from the surface to
          4,000 feet (charted in MSL) above airports with an operating control tower and are
          serviced by a radar approach control. The airspace typically consists of two rings: A
          core with a 5nm radius from the surface to 4,000 feet above airport elevation, and a
          shelf area that extends to 10nm from 1,200 to 4,000 feet above airport elevation. An
          additional Class C outer area extends out to 20nm and extends from the lower limits
          of radio/radar coverage up to the ceiling of the approach control’s designated
          airspace.
          2.6.5.3.2. Operations Requirements. To enter Class C airspace, a clearance is not
          required, however pilots must be in two-way radio communication with ATC.
          Unless otherwise authorized, when within 4 nm of the primary airport at or below
24                                               AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


     2,500 feet AGL, do not exceed 200 KIAS. Exception: If the aircraft flight manual
     requires a higher speed for safe operation, fly the lowest practical speed.
        2.6.5.3.2.1. Contact the Class C airspace ATC facility on the published frequency
        and give position, altitude, radar beacon code, destination, and request Class C
        service. Radio contact should be initiated far enough from the Class C airspace
        boundary to preclude entering Class C airspace before two-way radio
        communications are established. For example, ―SOCAL Approach, CROME 91,
        20 north of Burbank descending from 10,500 to 3000, squawking 4325, enroute to
        Van Nuys.‖
        2.6.5.3.2.2. When departing from a primary or secondary airport with an
        operating control tower, two-way radio communications must be established
        and maintained with the control tower, and thereafter as instructed by ATC
        while operating in Class C airspace.
        2.6.5.3.2.3. When departing a secondary airport without an operating control
        tower, two-way radio communications must be established as soon as
        practicable after departing with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the
        Class C airspace. For example, ―SOCAL Approach, ARROW 12, departed Van
        Nuys VFR climbing to 4500 enroute to Long Beach.‖
        2.6.5.3.2.4. In the event of radar outage, separation services are not provided in
        Class C airspace to VFR aircraft. Even when in radar coverage and under ATC
        control, VFR pilots are not relieved of the responsibility to see and avoid other
        traffic, wake turbulence, terrain, obstacles, or IMC. If any change to route or
        altitude is required due to these conditions, inform ATC and obtain an amended
        clearance.
        2.6.5.3.2.5. Pilot participation is voluntary within the 20 nm outer area and can be
        discontinued, within the outer area, at the pilot's request. Class C services will be
        provided in the outer area unless the pilot requests termination of the service. All
        participating VFR aircraft are provided basic radar services beyond the outer area
        on a workload-permitting basis. The controller can terminate this if workload
        dictates. USAF crews should continue to monitor the appropriate ATC frequency
        even if services are terminated.
        2.6.5.3.2.6. Some facilities provide Class C services only during published hours.
        At other times, only terminal IFR radar service will be provided. It is important
        to note that the communications and transponder requirements are dependent on
        the class of airspace established outside of the published hours.
        2.6.5.3.2.7. In some locations Class C airspace may overlay the Class D surface
        area of a secondary airport. In order to allow that control tower to provide service
        to aircraft, portions of the overlapping Class C airspace may be procedurally
        excluded when the secondary airport tower is in operation. Aircraft operating in
        these procedurally excluded areas will only be provided airport traffic control
        services when in communication with the secondary airport tower.
        2.6.5.3.2.8. Aircraft proceeding inbound to a secondary airport will be terminated
        at a sufficient distance to allow time to change to the appropriate tower or
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                 25


             advisory frequency. Class C services to these aircraft will be discontinued when
             the aircraft is instructed to contact the tower or change to advisory frequency.
             2.6.5.3.2.9. Aircraft departing secondary airports will not receive Class C
             services until they have been radar identified and two-way communications have
             been established with the Class C airspace facility.
          2.6.5.3.3. Equipment Requirements. An operable two-way radio and transponder
          with Mode C are required in Class C airspace.
          2.6.5.3.4. Charting. Class C airspace is charted on Sectional and VFR Terminal Area
          Charts. A complete listing of CONUS Class C airspace is also in Chapter 3 of the
          AIM and available electronically at http://www.faa.gov.
      2.6.5.4. Class D Airspace.

Figure 2.9. Class D Airspace.




          2.6.5.4.1. Location. Class D airspace (Figure 2.9.) is generally airspace from the
          surface to 2,500 feet above airport elevation around airports with an operating control
          tower. The lateral dimensions are tailored to the airspace and designed to contain
          published instrument procedures. Unless otherwise authorized, when within 4 nm of
          the airport at or below 2,500 feet AGL, do not exceed 200 KIAS. Exception: If the
          aircraft flight manual requires a higher speed for safe operation, fly the lowest
          practical speed.
          2.6.5.4.2. Operations Requirements. Two-way radio communication must be
          established and maintained with the ATC facility providing ATC services prior to
          entry into Class D airspace. Pilots of arriving aircraft should contact the control
          tower on the publicized frequency and give their position, altitude, destination, and
26                                                  AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


        any request(s). Radio contact should be initiated far enough from the airspace
        boundary to preclude entering Class D airspace before two-way radio
        communications are established. For example, ―KINGSTON Tower, SABER 24, 10
        miles north of the field at 3000 for landing with Charlie.‖
            2.6.5.4.2.1. At those airports where the control tower does not operate 24 hours a
            day, the operating hours of the tower will be listed on the appropriate charts and
            in the Enroute Supplement. During the hours the tower is not in operation, the
            Class E surface area rules or a combination of Class E rules to 700 feet above
            ground level and Class G rules to the surface will become applicable. See
            Enroute Supplement for specific operating hours and airspace information. Use
            caution when operating at military airfields when the control tower is closed. In
            most cases, consider the entire airfield closed if the tower is closed.
            2.6.5.4.2.2. When departing from a primary or secondary airport with an
            operating control tower, two-way radio communications must be established
            and maintained with the control tower, and thereafter as instructed by ATC
            while operating in the Class D airspace.
            2.6.5.4.2.3. When departing a secondary airport without an operating control
            tower, two-way radio communications should be established with ATC prior to
            departing. If unable to contact ATC on the ground, establish contact as soon as
            practicable after departure with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the
            Class D airspace. For example, ―HOLLOMAN Approach, RIPSAW 04, departed
            Alamogordo VFR climbing to 17,500 enroute to Albuquerque, request flight
            following.‖
        2.6.5.4.3. Equipment Requirements. Aircraft must have an operable two-way radio
        to operate in Class D airspace.
        2.6.5.4.4. Charting. Class D airspace is charted on Sectional and VFR Terminal Area
        charts.
     2.6.5.5. Class E Airspace.
        2.6.5.5.1. Location. Class E airspace encompasses any other controlled airspace that
        is not designated as Class A, B, C, D or a TRSA. Class E airspace has no defined
        vertical limit. It extends to the lower limit of the overlying or adjacent controlled
        airspace. There are several different types of Class E airspace of varying dimensions.
            2.6.5.5.1.1. Surface Area Designated for an Airport. Class E airspace that is
            configured to contain instrument approaches within controlled airspace. Extends
            down to the surface.
        2.6.5.5.1.2. Extension to a Surface Area. There are Class E extensions to Class B, C,
        and D surface areas designated for an airport. These provide controlled airspace to
        contain instrument approach procedures without imposing additional communication
        requirements for pilots operating under VFR.
            2.6.5.5.1.3. Airspace Used for Transition. Controlled airspace that extends from
            either 700 feet AGL or 1,200 feet AGL used to transition to/from the terminal or
            enroute environment.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                               27


            2.6.5.5.1.4. Federal Airways. Controlled airspace that extends from 1,200 feet
            AGL up to, but not including 18,000 feet MSL along a published route. These are
            normally the ―Victor Routes‖.
            2.6.5.5.1.5. Enroute Domestic Areas. Areas that extend upward from a specified
            altitude that provide controlled airspace where there is a requirement for IFR
            enroute ATC services but the Federal Airway system is inadequate.
            2.6.5.5.1.6. Offshore Airspace Areas. Areas located beyond 12 nm from the
            coast where there is a requirement to provide IFR enroute ATC services and
            where the US is applying domestic procedures. These areas begin at a specified
            altitude and extend up to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL.
            2.6.5.5.1.7. General Class E Airspace. Except where designated at a lower
            altitude, all airspace in the CONUS and Alaska (including the waters within 12
            nm of Alaska) above 14,500 feet MSL, up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL is
            Class E airspace.
            2.6.5.5.1.8. Alaska. All airspace above FL600 in Alaska is Class E airspace
            except Alaskan airspace west of 160W. All airspace in Alaska below 1,500 feet
            AGL is not Class E unless specifically designated.
        2.6.5.5.2. Operations Requirements.        There are no specific communication
        requirements for VFR aircraft operating in Class E airspace. No separation services
        are provided to VFR aircraft in Class E airspace.
        2.6.5.5.3. Equipment Requirements. There are no specific equipment requirements
        for operating VFR in Class E airspace.
        2.6.5.5.4. Charting. Class E Airspace is charted on Sectional and VFR Terminal
        Area Charts.
     2.6.5.6. Class F Airspace. Class F airspace is not used in CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, or
     other US possessions or territories. For more information on Class F airspace, consult the
     Area Planning (AP) series in FLIP or host nation AIP.
     2.6.5.7. Class G Airspace.
        2.6.5.7.1. Location. Class G, or uncontrolled airspace, is airspace that has not been
        designated as Class A, B, C, D, E, or F airspace.
        2.6.5.7.2. Operations Requirements.      There are no specific communication
        requirements for VFR aircraft operating in Class G airspace. No ATC services are
        provided to IFR or VFR aircraft in Class G airspace. IFR operations are permitted in
        Class G airspace and are largely autonomous. Therefore, pilots operating under VFR
        must exercise vigilance to insure separation from all aircraft, whether they are
        operating under IFR or VFR. AFI 11-202V3 outlines additional requirements for
        operations in Class G airspace. When operating VFR in Class G airspace, pilots
        must adhere to VFR cruising altitudes unless mission requirements dictate
        otherwise.
        2.6.5.7.3. Equipment Requirements. There are no specific equipment requirements
        for operations in Class G airspace.
 28                                                     AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


          2.6.5.7.4. Charting. Class G airspace is not specifically charted on VFR charts, other
          than it is airspace not otherwise designated. It is charted on IFR Enroute Low
          Altitude Charts in brown.
2.7. VFR Cruising Altitudes and Flight Levels. In the NAS, when flying under VFR, there is
a great deal of latitude for choosing altitude. However, to aid in separation between aircraft,
standard cruising altitudes for VFR flight exist. When flying under VFR, unless mission
requirements dictate otherwise, use the following table to determine an appropriate cruising
altitude. VFR cruising altitudes only apply when flying above 3000 feet AGL. Outside the
NAS, the pilot must consult the appropriate AP-series FLIP to determine the correct VFR flight
rules and cruising altitudes.

Table 2.1. VFR Cruising Altitudes and Flight Levels.
Magnetic Course      More Than 3000 Feet Above 18,000 Feet           Above FL 290*
                     AGL but Less Than        MSL to FL 290*

*Note: VFR flight is prohibited in FAA airspace above 18,000’ MSL without special
authorization.
2.8. General Air Traffic Services for VFR Aircraft. When operating under VFR, there is no
requirement for pilots to talk to ATC except when operating in Classes A-D airspace. Generally,
most operations under VFR are conducted in Class E airspace where communication is not
required. USAF pilots will utilize VFR flight following to the maximum extent practical where
available and mission requirements allow.
   2.8.1. Flight Following services for VFR aircraft are provided on a workload-permitting
   basis. Even when Flight Following is not available, it is recommended that pilots monitor
   the appropriate ATC frequency.
   2.8.2. Traffic advisories will be provided to all aircraft as the controller's work situation
   permits. When operating under VFR, pilots are ultimately responsible for terrain, obstacle,
   wake turbulence, and traffic avoidance.
   2.8.3. Safety Alerts are mandatory services provided to ALL aircraft. There are two types of
   Safety Alerts: Terrain/Obstruction and Aircraft Conflict/Mode C Intruder.
       2.8.3.1. A Terrain/Obstruction Alert is issued when, in the controller's judgment, an
       aircraft's altitude places it in unsafe proximity to terrain and/or obstructions.
       2.8.3.2. An Aircraft Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert is issued if the controller observes
       aircraft in unsafe proximity to each other. When feasible, the controller will offer aircraft
       an alternative course of action.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  29


   2.8.4. Two-way Radio Contact vs. ATC Clearance. When flying into different types of
   airspace, there may be a requirement for an ―ATC Clearance‖ to enter the airspace or only
   ―Two-way radio contact‖. It is important to understand these terms to prevent entering
   airspace without a clearance.
       2.8.4.1. An ATC clearance allows the aircraft to proceed into the controller’s airspace.
       For example, ―BULL 32, Cleared to enter Class B airspace, maintain 4500.‖
       2.8.4.2. Two-way radio contact means you are talking to ATC but may or may not have
       been cleared for anything. In order to be in two-way radio contact, the controller must
       refer to the aircraft by call sign. For example, if a controlling agency responds, ―RAVEN
       66 Stand by‖, this IS two-way radio contact because the controller used the aircraft call
       sign. If the controller responds, ―Aircraft calling Potomac Approach, standby‖, then two-
       way radio contact has NOT been established.
   2.8.5. Inoperative Equipment. ATC has some latitude in granting VFR aircraft on-the-spot
   access to airspace without meeting all equipment requirements. This is granted primarily to
   aircraft whose transponders become inoperative during flight on a traffic and workload-
   permitting basis. Pilots shall not plan to transit airspace without the minimum equipment
   requirements unless they acquire advance permission from ATC.
       2.8.5.1. NOTE: One-time ferry flights or long-term requirements for operations in
       airspace without meeting minimum equipment requirements should be addressed through
       the one-time ferry flight waiver and/or exemption processes outlined in FLIP GP and AP
       1, AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM directives.
       2.8.5.2. WARNING: Loss of a transponder or two-way radio communications in an Air
       Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA), or Temporary
       Flight Restriction (TFR) are taken very seriously by air traffic control and air defense.
       Consult NOTAMS or the Flight Information Handbook for transponder/radio failure
       procedures in these types of airspace. Failure to comply with transponder/radio failure
       procedures can result in your aircraft being intercepted.
2.9. Special Use Airspace. Special use airspace confines certain aerial activities due to their
nature and/or imposes restrictions on aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities.
Except for controlled firing areas, special use airspace areas are depicted on Sectional and VFR
Terminal Area Charts. Charted descriptions include the hours of operation, altitudes, and the
controlling agency. Definitions of the types of Special Use Airspace are in FLIP GP Chapter 2.
FLIP AP volumes contain the specific locations and dimensions of all Special Use Airspace in
the US and other countries.
   2.9.1. Prohibited Areas (Figure 2.10.)
       2.9.1.1. Prohibited areas contain airspace of defined dimensions where flight by aircraft
       is prohibited. Such areas are established for security or other reasons associated with the
       national welfare. These areas are depicted on Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Charts
       and the Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Chart Legends.
       2.9.1.2. WARNING: The dimensions of prohibited areas are frequently changed with
       little notice due to security requirements. Most notably are the prohibited areas in the
       Washington DC area. Pilots must check the NOTAMS carefully prior to each flight to
 30                                                    AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


      ensure they have accurate prohibited area dimensions. Aircraft that penetrate
      prohibited areas without authorization are generally intercepted and may be forced to
      land or fired upon.
      2.9.1.3. Since flight within prohibited areas is not permitted at any time, there is no
      specific ―controlling agency‖. Therefore, the charts will show ―No A/G‖ in the
      communications area since no air-to-ground communications are available unless the
      owner of the prohibited area specifically requests otherwise.
      2.9.1.4. There are specialized military flight operations allowed in prohibited areas,
      however, these are extremely restricted, regulated and confined to specific units and/or
      missions. If specifically tasked for one of these specialized missions, flight within the
      prohibited area is permitted IAW procedures specified in the mission documentation or
      local procedures.

Figure 2.10. Prohibited Area.




   2.9.2. Restricted Areas (Figure 2.11.)
      2.9.2.1. Restricted areas contain airspace identified by an area within which the flight of
      aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restrictions. Activities within these
      areas must be confined because of their nature or limitations imposed upon aircraft
      operations that are not a part of those activities or both. Restricted areas denote the
      existence of unusual, often invisible hazards to aircraft such as artillery firing, aerial
      gunnery, or guided missiles. Penetration of restricted areas by non-participating aircraft
      without authorization from the using or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous
      to the aircraft and its occupants. These areas are depicted on Sectional and VFR
      Terminal Area Charts and the Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Chart Legends.
      2.9.2.2. When operating VFR in the vicinity of a Restricted Area, pilots must be
      cognizant of the location of Restricted Areas to avoid penetration. However, if the
      Restricted Area is not active and has been released to the FAA controlling agency, ATC
      will allow IFR and VFR-on-top aircraft to operate along a route in the Restricted Area
      without issuing a specific clearance to do so. If operating VFR in the vicinity of a
      Restricted Area, if in doubt as to the status of the Restricted Area, contact the appropriate
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  31


      ATC facility to clarify its status prior to entering the airspace. If the Restricted Area is
      active, non-participating aircraft must remain clear of the area.

Figure 2.11. Restricted Area.




   2.9.3. Warning Areas (Figure 2.12.)
      2.9.3.1. Warning Areas extend outward from three nautical miles from the coast of the
      U.S. They contain activity that may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The
      purpose of such warning areas is to warn nonparticipating aircraft of the potential danger.
      A warning area may be located over domestic or international waters or both. VFR
      aircraft are not specifically prohibited from entering active Warning Areas, however, to
      do so could be extremely hazardous to the aircraft or its occupants. Warning Areas are
      depicted on Sectional Charts and the VFR Terminal Area Chart Legends.
      2.9.3.2. When operating VFR in the vicinity of a Warning Area, pilots must be cognizant
      of the location of the Warning Area to avoid penetrating it. When a Warning Area is
      active, non-participating aircraft are not prohibited from penetrating it since Warning
      Areas are largely in International Airspace. Unless the mission warrants, non-
      participating VFR USAF aircraft will not penetrate an active Warning Area unless in
      contact with the controlling agency.
 32                                                    AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


Figure 2.12. Warning Area.




   2.9.4. Military Operations Areas (MOA) (Figure 2.13.)
      2.9.4.1. MOAs consist of airspace of defined vertical and lateral limits established for the
      purpose of separating certain military training activities from IFR traffic. Examples of
      activities conducted in MOAs include, but are not limited to: air combat tactics, air
      intercepts, aerobatics, formation training, and low-altitude tactics.
      2.9.4.2. VFR aircraft are not prohibited from entering an active MOA, however, to do so
      may be hazardous to the aircraft or its occupants. Non-participating VFR USAF aircraft
      will not penetrate an active MOA unless in contact with the controlling agency.
      2.9.4.3. The activity status (active/inactive) of MOAs may change frequently. Therefore,
      pilots should contact any FSS within 100 miles of the area to obtain accurate real-time
      information concerning the MOA hours of operation. Prior to entering an active MOA,
      pilots will contact the controlling agency for traffic advisories.
      2.9.4.4. If military aircraft utilizing the MOA become aware of non-participating
      traffic transiting the MOA, the pilot/flight lead will keep the aircraft/formation well
      clear of the traffic.
      2.9.4.5. MOAs are depicted on Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Charts.
      2.9.4.6. MOAs extend only to 18,000 MSL. In many areas, military operations are
      conducted in the Class A airspace over the lateral limits of the MOA, sometimes to FL
      600. These areas are called Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) and can
      contain the same types of activities conducted in the MOA underneath. ATCAA airspace
      is not charted except in directives and agreements between the ATC facility and the local
      unit(s). When authorized to operate VFR in Class A airspace, use caution when
      operating over the lateral limits of an active MOA. ATC and the FSS can be an excellent
      source of information for non-participating aircraft on activity within the ATCAA.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                    33


Figure 2.13. Military Operating Area (MOA).




   2.9.5. Alert Areas (Figure 2.14.)
      2.9.5.1. Alert areas are depicted on Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Charts to inform
      non-participating pilots of areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training or an
      unusual type of aerial activity. The depiction of an Alert Area is the same as a Prohibited
      or Restricted Area but will be prefaced with an A rather than a P or an R. Pilots should
      be particularly alert when flying in these areas.
      2.9.5.2. Although there are no specific special procedures for flight in an Alert Area,
      pilots of participating aircraft as well as pilots transiting the area are equally responsible
      for collision avoidance. IAW AFI 11-202V3, when operating under VFR, pilots will
      utilize Flight Following or other radar services to the max extent practical.

Figure 2.14. Alert Areas.




   2.9.6. Controlled Firing Areas (CFA).
 34                                                   AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


      2.9.6.1. CFAs contain activities that, if not conducted in a controlled environment, could
      be hazardous to non-participating aircraft.
      2.9.6.2. The distinguishing feature of the CFA, as compared to other special use airspace,
      is that its activities are suspended immediately when spotter aircraft, radar, or ground
      lookout positions indicate an aircraft might be approaching the area. There is no need to
      chart CFAs since they do not cause a non-participating aircraft to change its flight path.
   2.9.7. Wildlife and Recreation Areas (Figure 2.15.) While not necessarily ―special use
   airspace‖ VFR pilots need to be aware of areas designated as Wildlife or Recreational Areas.
   Depicted on Sectionals and Tactical Pilotage Charts as a solid blue line surrounding a string
   of blue dots, these areas require a minimum AGL altitude of 2000 feet. These areas prevent
   disturbance to wildlife in noise sensitive areas. Avoid flight within these areas unless
   necessitated by an emergency.

Figure 2.15. Wildlife or Recreation Area.




2.10. Military Training Routes (MTR) (Figure 2.16)
   2.10.1. The MTR program is a joint venture by the FAA and the Department of Defense
   (DOD). MTRs are developed for use by the military to conduct low-altitude, high-speed
   training. In general, routes above 1,500 feet AGL are developed for flight under IFR to the
   maximum extent possible. Routes at 1,500 feet AGL and below are generally developed for
   flight under VFR. NOTE: Slow Routes (SR) are not part of the MTR program. Great
   caution should be used in planning and flying SRs. Further information on SRs can be found
   in FLIP AP1/B. USAF pilots utilizing MTRs will follow coordination procedures found in
   AP/1B.
   2.10.2. In general, MTRs are established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds in
   excess of 250 knots. However, route segments may be defined at higher altitudes for
   purposes of route continuity. For example, route segments may be defined for descent,
   climb-out, and mountainous terrain. IFR and VFR routes are designated as follows:
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  35


      2.10.2.1. IFR Military Training Routes (IR). Operations on these routes are conducted in
      accordance with IFR regardless of weather conditions, unless otherwise specified in the
      route description. See AP/1B page 2-1 for further details on IR routes.
      2.10.2.2. VFR Training Routes (VR). Operations on these routes are conducted in
      accordance with VFR except flight visibility shall be 5 miles or more; and flights shall
      not be conducted below a ceiling of less than 3,000 feet AGL.
   2.10.3. Charting. Military training routes are identified and charted as follows:
      2.10.3.1. Route identification.
          2.10.3.1.1. MTRs with no segment above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by four
          number characters; e.g., IR1206, VR1207.
          2.10.3.1.2. MTRs that include one or more segments above 1,500 feet AGL are
          identified by three number characters; e.g., IR206, VR207.
          2.10.3.1.3. Alternate IR/VR routes or route segments are identified by using the
          basic/principal route designation followed by a letter suffix, e.g., IR008A, VR1007B,
          etc.

Figure 2.16. Military Training Route.




      2.10.3.2. Route charting.
          2.10.3.2.1. IFR Low Altitude En Route Chart. This chart depicts all IR routes and all
          VR routes that accommodate operations above 1,500 feet AGL.
          2.10.3.2.2. Sectional Charts. These charts will depict military training activities such
          as IR, VR, MOA, Restricted Area, Warning Area, and Alert Area information.
          2.10.3.2.3. Area Planning (AP/1B) Chart (DOD FLIP). This chart is published by
          the DOD primarily for military users and contains detailed information on both IR
          and VR routes. DOD FLIP contains charts and narrative descriptions of these routes.
   2.10.4. Nonparticipating aircraft are not prohibited from flying within an MTR; however,
   extreme vigilance should be exercised when conducting flight through or near these routes.
   Pilots should contact any FSS within 100 nm of a particular MTR to obtain current
   information about route usage. Information available includes times of scheduled activity,
   altitudes in use on each route segment, and actual route width. Route width varies for each
   MTR and can extend several miles on either side of the charted MTR centerline. Route
   width information for IR and VR MTRs is also available in the FLIP AP/1B along with slow
 36                                                     AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


   route/air refueling route information. When requesting MTR information, pilots should give
   the FSS their position, route of flight, and destination in order to reduce frequency congestion
   and permit the FSS specialist to identify the MTRs which could be a factor. NOTE:
   Information on slow routes and air refueling routes will not be available from the FSS.
2.11. Airport Advisory Services.
   2.11.1. There are three advisory type services available at selected airports.
       2.11.1.1. Local Airport Advisory (LAA) service is operated within 10 statute miles of an
       airport where a control tower is not operating but where a FSS is located on the airport.
       At such locations, the FSS provides a complete local airport advisory service to arriving
       and departing aircraft. During periods of fast changing weather the FSS will
       automatically provide Final Guard as part of the service from the time the aircraft reports
       "on-final" or "taking-the-active-runway" until the aircraft reports "on-the-ground" or
       "airborne." NOTE: Current policy, when requesting remote ATC services, requires that
       a pilot monitor the automated weather broadcast at the landing airport prior to requesting
       ATC services. The FSS automatically provides Final Guard, when appropriate, during
       LAA/Remote Airport Advisory (RAA) operations. Final Guard is a value added
       wind/altimeter monitoring service, which provides an automatic wind and altimeter check
       during active weather situations when the pilot reports on final or taking the active
       runway. During landing or take-off operations, when the winds or altimeter are actively
       changing, the FSS will broadcast significant changes in the blind if the specialist
       determines the change might affect the operation. Pilots should acknowledge the first
       wind/altimeter check but due to cockpit activity no acknowledgement is expected for the
       blind broadcasts. It is prudent for a pilot to report on-the-ground or airborne to end the
       service.
       2.11.1.2. RAA service operates within 10 statute miles of specified high activity general
       aviation airports where a control tower is not operating. Airports offering this service are
       listed in the Enroute Supplement and the published service hours may be changed by
       NOTAM. Final Guard is automatically provided with RAA.
       2.11.1.3. Remote Airport Information Service (RAIS) is provided in support of short
       term special events like small to medium fly-ins. The service is advertised by NOTAM
       only. The FSS will not have access to a continuous readout of the current winds and
       altimeter; therefore, RAIS does not include weather and/or Final Guard service.
       However, known traffic, special event instructions, and all other FSS services are
       provided.
   2.11.2. USAF pilots are not required to participate in Airport Advisory Services, however,
   participation is highly recommended unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
2.12. Published VFR Routes. Published VFR routes are designed for transitioning around,
under and through complex airspace such as Class B airspace. All of the following terms, i.e.,
"VFR Flyway" "VFR Corridor" and "Class B Airspace VFR Transition Route" have been used
when referring to the same or different types of routes or airspace. The following paragraphs
clarify the functionality of each type of route and specify where and when an ATC clearance is
required.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                37


   2.12.1. VFR Flyways. A VFR Flyway (Figure 2.17.) is a general flight path, not a specific
   course for use by pilots in planning flights into, out of, through or near complex terminal
   airspace to avoid Class B airspace. An ATC clearance is NOT required to fly these routes.
      2.12.1.1. VFR Flyways are depicted on the reverse side of some of the VFR Terminal
      Area Charts. Eventually all Terminal Area Charts will include a VFR Flyway Planning
      Chart. These charts identify VFR flyways designed to help VFR pilots avoid major
      controlled traffic flows. For charting of VFR Flyways, see the Sectional and VFR
      Terminal Area Chart Legends. They may further depict multiple VFR routings
      throughout the area which may be used as an alternative to flight within Class B airspace.
      The ground references provide a guide for improved visual navigation. These routes are
      not intended to discourage requests for VFR operations within Class B airspace but are
      designed solely to assist pilots in planning for flights under and around busy Class B
      airspace without actually entering Class B airspace.
      2.12.1.2. It is very important to remember that these suggested routes are not sterile of
      other traffic. The entire Class B airspace, and the airspace underneath it, may be heavily
      congested with many different types of aircraft. Pilots must comply withVFR at all times
      while on a VFR flyway. Further, when operating beneath Class B airspace,
      communications must be established and maintained with all control towers while
      transiting the Class B, C, and D surface areas of those airports under Class B
      Airspace.

Figure 2.17. VFR Flyway.




   2.12.2. VFR Corridors (Figure 2.18.) The design of a few of the first Class B airspace areas
   provided a corridor for the passage of uncontrolled traffic. A VFR corridor is defined as
   airspace through Class B airspace, with defined vertical and lateral boundaries, in which
   aircraft may operate without an ATC clearance or communication with air traffic control.
   Charting of VFR Corridors is shown in the Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Chart Legends.
      2.12.2.1. These corridors are, in effect, a "hole" through Class B airspace. A corridor is
      surrounded on all sides by Class B airspace and does not extend down to the surface like
 38                                                     AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


      a VFR Flyway. Because of their finite lateral and vertical limits, and the volume of VFR
      traffic using a corridor, extreme caution and vigilance must be exercised.
      2.12.2.2. Because of the heavy traffic volume and the procedures necessary to efficiently
      manage the flow of traffic, it has not been possible to incorporate VFR corridors in the
      development or modifications of Class B airspace in recent years.

Figure 2.18. VFR Corridor.

   2.12.3. Class B Airspace VFR Transition Routes. (Figure 2.19.)
      2.12.3.1. To accommodate VFR traffic through certain Class B airspace, such as Seattle,
      Phoenix and Los Angeles, Class B Airspace VFR Transition Routes exist. A Class B
      Airspace VFR Transition Route is defined as a specific flight course depicted on a
      Terminal Area Chart for transiting Class B airspace. These routes include specific ATC-
      assigned altitudes, and pilots must obtain an ATC clearance prior to entering Class B
      airspace on the route.
      2.12.3.2. These routes, as depicted in the Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Chart
      Legends, are designed to show the pilot where to position the aircraft outside of, or clear
      of, the Class B airspace where an ATC clearance can normally be acquired with minimal
      or no delay. Until ATC authorization is received, pilots must remain clear of Class B
      airspace. On initial contact, pilots should advise ATC of their position, altitude, route
      name desired, and direction of flight. After a clearance is received, pilots must fly the
      route as depicted and, most importantly, adhere to ATC instructions.

2.13. Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA) (Figure 2.20).
   2.13.1. TRSAs were originally established as part of the Terminal Radar Program at selected
   airports. TRSAs were never controlled airspace from a regulatory standpoint because the
   establishment of TRSAs was never subject to the rulemaking process; consequently, TRSAs
   are not contained in, nor are there any TRSA operating rules in the CFRs. Part of the Airport
   Radar Service Area (ARSA) program was to eventually replace all TRSAs with ARSAs
   (now designated Class C airspace). However, Class C requirements are relatively stringent
   and not all TRSAs met the traffic flow or passenger enplanement requirements to convert to
   an ARSA or Class C airspace, but still had sufficient traffic volume to justify radar services.
   Therefore, TRSAs do not fit into any of the U.S. airspace classes and TRSA services are
   voluntary. TRSAs are charted in the Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Chart Legends.
   2.13.2. USAF pilots will use TRSA services when operating under VFR (when available)
   unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
   2.13.3. No clearance is required to enter a TRSA. However, if the TRSA contains an airport
   with an operating control tower (normally the primary airport and possibly some secondary
   airports as well) then normal Class D procedures apply regardless of whether you choose to
   participate in TRSA services.

2.14. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR). TFRs can be established for a variety of reasons.
Long-term TFRs may be charted on Sectional or VFR Terminal Area Charts however their
dimensions frequently change. Some TFRs apply only to civil aircraft and others apply to all
aircraft. Unauthorized aircraft penetrating TFRs are subject to being intercepted, forced to land,
or may be fired upon. When operating IFR, ATC will generally keep aircraft from penetrating a
TFR unless they are authorized to route non-participating aircraft through the area. When
operating VFR, pilots will ensure the aircraft remains clear of the TFR unless authorized to
enter. A thorough review of NOTAMs prior to each flight is essential to avoid inadvertent
penetration of a TFR.
   2.14.1. Some of the reasons for establishing a TFR include:
       2.14.1.1. Protect persons and property on the surface or in the air from a hazard
       associated with an incident on the surface.
       2.14.1.2. Provide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft.
       2.14.1.3. Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident or event
       that may generate a high degree of public interest.
       2.14.1.4. Protect inhabitants in a declared national disaster area for humanitarian reasons
       in the State of Hawaii.
       2.14.1.5. Protect the President, Vice President, or other public figures.
       2.14.1.6. Provide a safe environment for space agency operations.

ON SCENE EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITY.
CHICAGO /ZAU/ ARTCC, TELEPHONE 630-906-8341, IS THE FAA
COORDINATION FACILITY.
  2.14.3. The NOTAM establishing the TFR will include the reason for establishing it.
     2.14.3.1. When the reason for establishing the TFR is covered under 2.14.1.1., 2.14.1.2
     or 2.14.1.4, only participating hazard relief aircraft under the direction of the official in
     charge of the on-scene emergency may fly in this area.
  2.14.4. NOTE: If the aircraft is operating on an ATC approved IFR flight plan and receives
  an ATC clearance through the TFR then flight is permitted IAW the ATC clearance.
  2.14.5. NOTE: If weather or terrain preclude avoidance of the area when operating under
  VFR directly to or from an airport in the TFR, and notification is given to the FSS or ATC
  facility designated in the NOTAM, then flight is permitted provided it does not interfere with
  relief operations and is not for sightseeing.
  2.14.6. Except as noted in paragraph 2.14.3.1., aircraft must have a specific authorization to
  fly in a TFR. USAF aircraft shall have authorization from the appropriate authority prior
  to flight in a TFR.
  2.14.7. The amount of airspace needed to protect persons and property or provide a safe
  environment for rescue/relief aircraft operations is normally limited to within 2,000 feet
  above the surface and within a 3-nautical-mile radius. Incidents occurring within Class B,
  Class C, or Class D airspace will normally be handled through existing procedures and
  should not require the issuance of a TFR NOTAM. Temporary flight restrictions affecting
  airspace outside of the U.S. and its territories and possessions are issued with verbiage
  excluding that airspace outside of the 12-mile coastal limits.
  2.14.8. The FSS nearest an incident site is normally the "coordination facility." When FAA
  communications assistance is required, the designated FSS will function as the primary
  communications facility for coordination between emergency control authorities and affected
  aircraft. The ARTCC may act as liaison for the emergency control authorities if adequate
  communications cannot be established between the designated FSS and the relief
  organization. For example, the coordination facility may relay authorizations from the on-
  scene emergency response official in cases where news media aircraft operations are
  approved at the altitudes used by relief aircraft.
  2.14.9. ATC may authorize operations in a temporary flight restrictions area under its own
  authority only when flight restrictions are established for the reasons listed in 2.14.1.1.
  through 2.14.1.3. The appropriate ARTCC/airport traffic control tower manager will,
 42                                                     AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


   however, ensure that such authorized flights do not hamper activities or interfere with the
   event for which restrictions were implemented.
   2.14.10. To preclude misunderstanding, the implementing NOTAM will contain specific and
   formatted information. The facility establishing a temporary flight restrictions area will
   format a NOTAM beginning with the phrase "FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS" followed by: the
   location of the temporary flight restrictions area, the effective period, the area defined in
   statute miles, the altitudes affected, the FAA coordination facility and commercial telephone
   number, the reason for the temporary flight restrictions, the agency directing any relief
   activities and its commercial telephone number and other information considered appropriate
   by the issuing authority.
2.15. National Security Areas (NSA). National Security Areas consist of airspace of defined
vertical and lateral dimensions established at locations where there is a requirement for increased
security and safety of ground facilities. Pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid flying through
the depicted NSA. When it is necessary to provide a greater level of security and safety, flight in
NSAs may be temporarily prohibited. Regulatory prohibitions will be disseminated via
NOTAM.
2.16. Parachute Jumping Operations (Figure 2.21)
   2.16.1. Civil parachute jump areas are in the FAA Airport Facility Directory. They are also
   sometimes annotated on Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Charts as shown in the Sectional
   and VFR Terminal Area Chart Legends.

Figure 2.21. Parachute/Glider Operations Area Depiction.




   2.16.2. It is recommended that pilots of parachute jump aircraft avoid releasing parachutists
   while aircraft are in the traffic pattern and make broadcasts on the appropriate ATC
   frequencies. Prior to commencing a jump operation, the pilot should broadcast the aircraft's
   altitude and position in relation to the airport, the approximate relative time when the jump
   will commence and terminate, and listen to the position reports of other aircraft in the area.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  43


   These calls are not mandatory. Pilots must exercise caution when operating in the vicinity of
   parachute jumping areas.
2.17. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) (Figure 2.22)
   2.17.1. The ADIZ is an area of airspace over land or water in which the ready identification,
   location, and control of civil aircraft is required in the interest of national security. VFR
   operations are permitted in the ADIZ and are referred to as Defense Visual Flight Rules
   (DVFR).

Figure 2.22. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).




      2.17.1.1. Although this definition states ―civil aircraft‖, in reality all aircraft, whether
      civil or military must be positively identified. Consequently, civil DVFR procedures also
      apply to most military VFR operations as well. Specific exceptions are made for certain
      missions. These exceptions will be specifically authorized in the Air Tasking Order
      (ATO), Airspace Control Order (ACO), Special Operating Instructions (SPINS),
      Memorandum, or equivalent document.
      2.17.1.2. Pilots will not deviate from normal DVFR procedures without authorization
      from a competent authority or risk interception.
   2.17.2. Operating Requirements.
      2.17.2.1. A functioning two-way radio is required. Pilots must maintain at least a
      listening watch on the appropriate aeronautical facility frequency unless mission
      requirements dictate otherwise.
      2.17.2.2. For departures from an airport in the ADIZ, pilots must file a DVFR flight
      plan IAW FLIP GP and the aircraft must depart within five minutes of the estimated
      departure time in the flight plan unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
          2.17.2.2.1. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC or mission requirements dictate, do
          not operate an aircraft into, within, or cross an ADIZ unless you file, activate, and
          close a flight plan with the appropriate aeronautical facility.
44                                                   AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


        2.17.2.2.2. If the departure airport is within the Alaskan ADIZ and there is no facility
        for filing a flight plan, then immediately after takeoff, when within range of an
        appropriate aeronautical facility, comply with the above directions as appropriate, or
        proceed according to the instructions issued by the appropriate aeronautical facility.
     2.17.2.3. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC or mission requirements, a functioning
     transponder with Mode C is required for flight in an ADIZ. NOTE: This does not
     apply to aircraft originally certificated without an engine driven electrical system and
     which has not subsequently been certified with such a system. This includes balloons
     and gliders.
  2.17.3. DVFR Flight Procedures.
     2.17.3.1. The pilot in command of an aircraft for which a DVFR flight plan has been
     filed shall file an arrival or completion notice with an appropriate aeronautical facility,
     unless the flight plan states that no notice will be filed or mission requirements dictate
     otherwise.
     2.17.3.2. Position reports for DVFR flights.
        2.17.3.2.1. Prior to penetrating the ADIZ boundary, report to the appropriate
        aeronautical facility the following: Time, position, altitude at the last reporting
        point prior to penetration of the ADIZ, and next appropriate reporting point along
        the route.
        2.17.3.2.2. If there is no appropriate reporting point along the flight route, report
        the following 15 minutes prior to ADIZ penetration: estimated time, position, and
        altitude crossing the ADIZ boundary.
        2.17.3.2.3. If the airport is within the ADIZ or so close to the ADIZ boundary that
        it prevents compliance with the above paragraphs, report the following immediately
        after takeoff: the time of departure, altitude, and estimated time of arrival over the
        first reporting point along the flight route. NOTE: When mission requirements
        dictate and are authorized by appropriate authority, position reporting is not required
        when operating VFR in an ADIZ.
        2.17.3.2.4. Position reporting tolerances. Position reports should be made within five
        minutes or less of the estimated time over each reporting point or point of penetration
        of an ADIZ or, in the case of a flight originating within an ADIZ, depart within five
        minutes of the proposed time of departure specified in the flight plan unless the actual
        time of departure is reported to an appropriate aeronautical facility.
     2.17.3.3. Navigation tolerances. Maintain a distance of no more than ten nautical miles
     from the centerline of the route of flight if the flight is entering or operating within an
     ADIZ, or 20 nautical miles from the centerline of the route of flight if the flight is
     entering or operating within a coastal ADIZ or the Alaska ADIZ.
        2.17.3.3.1. Aircraft flights that are operated in excess of specific tolerances are
        subject to interception to confirm their identity. The unnecessary dispatch of manned
        interceptors is costly to the United States and can be avoided by adhering to
        established DVFR procedures.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                              45


          2.17.3.3.2. Do not deviate from the filed DVFR flight plan without notifying the
          appropriate aeronautical facility unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
      2.17.3.4. For radio failure when operating VFR in an ADIZ, consult the Flight
      Information Handbook (FIH). When operating under DVFR, proceed with the original
      DVFR flight plan OR land as soon as practicable. The pilot shall report the radio
      failure to an appropriate aeronautical facility as soon as possible.
2.18. Special Operating Procedures in the Vicinity of Washington DC. The area
surrounding Washington DC is designated as an SFRA and ADIZ (Figure 2.23.) where unique
procedures apply. These procedures change frequently and are disseminated by NOTAM. All
aircraft must comply with the special operating procedures or risk interception. Consult
NOTAMS for “KZDC” prior to each flight in the vicinity of Washington DC for complete text
of current flight restrictions.
   2.18.1. Military aircraft are not exempt from the requirements of the Washington DC ADIZ.
   It is essential that a thorough NOTAM review be conducted prior to any VFR flight inside or
   in the vicinity of the Washington DC ADIZ.
   2.18.2. The Washington DC SFRA/ADIZ is charted on the Washington DC Sectional and
   VFR Terminal Area Charts. However, pilots must still consult the NOTAMS to verify the
   dimensions. Sectional and VFR Terminal Area Charts are only updated on a six-month
   cycle and dimensions could be outdated.

                                PLANNING A VFR FLIGHT

3.1. Altimeter Setting Procedures.
   3.1.1. All altimeter setting procedures and information in AFMAN 11-217V1, as well as the
   FIH, apply to VFR flight.
   3.1.2. When operating at uncontrolled or austere locations, use all means available to obtain
   a local altimeter setting prior to departure. Some uncontrolled airports have automated
   weather reporting capability that includes altimeter setting.
      3.1.2.1. At certain locations it may be possible to obtain a nearby altimeter setting.
      However, use caution as bodies of water, terrain, or meteorological phenomenon can
      cause significant local differences in altimeter settings over a short distance.
      3.1.2.2. If no other means are available to obtain a local altimeter setting, set the airport
      elevation in the altimeter.
3.2. Route Development.
   3.2.1. Chart Types and Their Use: Pilots flying VFR away from home station will have a
   properly annotated VFR chart, appropriate to the mission, readily available in the cockpit.
      3.2.1.1. Sectional Charts and VFR Terminal Area Charts. Sectional Charts and VFR
      Terminal Area Charts are published by the National Aeronautical Charting Office
      (NACO) and are approved by both DoD and the FAA for use during VFR navigation.
      Both are published on a six month cycle (12 months for selected Alaskan Sectional
      Charts). Expiration dates are staggered so not all charts expire on the same day.
          3.2.1.1.1. Effective dates and expiration dates are shown on the front of the chart.
          (Figure 3.1.) Data on the front of sectional/VFR terminal area charts will include the
          latest airspace changes through the date annotated. Generally this date is the same as
          the effective date. Other data (obstacles, terrain, etc.) will be included through
          another date, generally about 2 months prior to the effective date. For this reason,
          pilots must review NOTAMs, the FAA Airfield Facility Directory, and the Chart
          Updating Manual (CHUM) for the latest aeronautical data prior to VFR flights.
          3.2.1.1.2. Most sectional charts are printed every six months; however, if a chart is
          more than eight weeks old, it probably isn’t current. Aeronautical information
          changes frequently. All charts necessary for the mission will be updated with the
          most current information available. To update sectionals, NACO publishes the
          Aeronautical Chart Bulletin in the back of each Airport/Facility Directory (AFD)
          every 56 days (also available online at http://www.naco.faa.gov under Aeronautical
          Charting/Free Downloads/VFR Chart Bulletins). Additionally, NACO maintains a
          comprehensive guide of aeronautical chart information (Aeronautical Chart User’s
          Guide) available as a free download under the Aeronautical Charting/Freedownloads
          tab.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                 47

          3.2.1.1.3. The geographic area covered by a particular Sectional Chart (Figure 3.2.) is
          annotated on the front cover of the chart. Hash marks denote on the map the
          approximate area covered by a particular Sectional Chart. Terminal Area Charts are
          published for each Class B airspace area in the US. Terminal Area Charts are
          denoted by purple hash marks on the overall map of the US on the front cover of all
          Sectional Charts. Terminal Area Charts do not have this overall map of the US, only
          the name of the Terminal Area Chart.

         3.2.1.1.4. The front cover of the Sectional Charts shows the coloring of terrain
         contours (Figure 3.3.) depicted on that particular chart, along with the highest
         elevation on the chart with its geographic coordinates.
             3.2.1.1.4.1. VFR Terminal Area Charts (TAC) provide greater detail and clarity
             of information than a sectional covering the same area.
                3.2.1.1.4.1.1. The front of a TAC will show the area in great detail, including
                terrain features. The back of the TAC will exclude the terrain features and
                only show the airspace boundaries, navaids and prominent landmarks.

         3.2.1.1.5. The rear cover of Sectional Charts has a legend that depicts symbols used
         in Sectional Charts (Figure 3.4.) The rear cover of VFR Terminal Area Charts may
         depict symbols used on VFR Terminal Area Charts.
            3.2.1.1.5.1. The legends are identical with one exception. Sectional Charts have
            additional symbology to differentiate airports with different runway lengths.

      3.2.1.2. Chart Selection. Select charts (JNC, ONC, TPC, JOG, etc.) that satisfy
      navigational requirements and provide the desired detail commensurate with planned
      altitude and speed. Charts with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater detail are desired for low-
      level operations. Use a larger scale (i.e. 1:50,000) or greater to locate the objective. Use
      a prominent ground feature when changing between charts.

          3.2.1.2.5. The 1:50,000 Topographic Line map (TLM) (Figure 3.9.) is a lithographic
          map that portrays the greater detail of topographic and cultural information. Relief is
          shown by contours and spot elevations measured in meters, feet or yards. The map is
          a true representation of terrain detail. Features are plotted to correct orientation and
          true location. The map depicts the level of detail required for detailed route and
          objective area study as well as foot navigation in the case of a survival or evasion
          situation.

          3.2.1.2.6. Modern computer flight planning software suites may be able to generate
          charts with even smaller scales, or digital/satellite-acquired images of ground
          features, and are useful for selecting specific identifiable features like the western
          edge of a dam, or a certain building along a road.
          3.2.1.2.7. Satellite imagery provides the most accurate depiction of an objective area,
          allowing easier identification of terrain feature and natural and man-made landmarks.

          3.2.1.2.8. VFR Helicopter Charts (Figure 3.11.) NACO publishes VFR Helicopter
          Charts for navigation in major cities with a high concentration of helicopter activity.
          Helicopter Charts are four-color charts depicting current aeronautical information
          (heliports, frequencies, lighting, NAVAIDs and obstructions) and items to aid VFR
          navigation (pictorial symbols, roads and easily identifiable geographical features).

      3.2.2.2. Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS). A multifaceted software system
      designed for combat mission planning. As a stand-alone tool it can produce all materials
      (charts, flight plans, etc.) necessary to accomplish missions in any environment. The
      software supports air-to-air, air-to-ground, air refueling, electronic combat,
      reconnaissance, special operations, bombing missions from all altitudes and weapon
      release types, airlift, and rescue missions. PFPS is Microsoft Windows based and can
      operate from commercially available notebook computers.
      3.2.2.3. The Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS). A robust modular software
      and computer hardware suite that allows Air Force mission planners to go from the Air
      Tasking Order (ATO) to mission debrief in one all-inclusive process. The main tools
      available to the Air Force mission planner utilizing AFMSS are:
         3.2.2.3.1. The Mission Planning System (MPS). Expands the capability of PFPS to
         integrate with theater battle management systems such as the ATO, threat analysis,
         intelligence and imagery updates, mission folder production, terrain based radar
         predictions, and terrain based perspective views.
      3.2.2.4. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The next generation of mission
      planning tools that will replace PFPS. Already in use by a limited number of weapon
      systems, JMPS includes a core software suite called the Joint Mission Planning
      Environment (JMPE) which combines with Unique Planning Component (UPC)
      software that supports a particular weapon system or user. JMPS will eventually support
      most of the aircraft in the DoD inventory as well as DoD sensor assets.

  3.2.3. Sources of Airport Information (For departure/arrival/emergency airport information.)
     3.2.3.1. FLIP
         3.2.3.1.1. IFR Supplement. Contains reference data and flight procedures for
         airdromes across the United States. Information includes runway dimensions and
         capabilities, available aircraft services, communications, navigational aids, and
         various other airdrome details. All airports listed in the IFR Supplement will have at
         least one DoD published IAP and/or ASR/PAR minima.
         3.2.3.1.2. VFR Supplement. Directory consisting of an airport sketch with
         supporting text of military and general aviation VFR airports (landplanes, seaplanes
         and heliports) selected by the respective military departments. Airports listed in the
         VFR supplement generally do not have instrument approach procedures available.
     3.2.3.1.3. Instrument Approach Procedures. DoD instrument approach plate books
     contain airport diagrams that include useful information about the airport, its facilities,
     and the surrounding features. In general, the information in the IAPs should be a
     secondary or backup source of flight planning information.
     3.2.3.1.4. The AP-1 series includes information about military low level routes (SR, VR
     and IR), airfield information (not available in the IFR Supplement) and information about
     nearby airspace (ranges and hazards).
     3.2.3.2. Other Sources
     3.2.3.2.1. Jeppesen publishes an Airport Information Directory (J-AID) that covers the
     entire US in a two-column format with detailed airport operation information, expanded
     airport remarks on FBO services, rental cars, lodging and restaurants. VFR airport
     diagrams are included.
         3.2.3.2.2. The Airport Facility Directory (AF/D), published by the National
         Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) is available online at http://naco.faa.gov. The
         AF/D may be useful in VFR flight planning if DoD materials don’t contain the
         desired information.
  3.2.4. Chart Building. Units may establish low-level surveyed routes or Low Altitude
  Tactical Navigation (LATN) areas IAW AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management.
  MAJCOMS will publish standardized guidance on required chart information. All charts,
  including the master chart, will be updated with current DAFIF/E-CHUM and the date of
  the information will be annotated clearly on the charts. In the absence of MAJCOM
  guidance, VFR charts utilized by fixed wing aircraft will include, at a minimum: Course
  lines, magnetic heading, leg distance, and time for any segments flown below 1000’ AGL.
  Helicopters may fly in an annually surveyed low level area with a current CHUM/E-CHUM
  above 200’ AGL without the above chart requirements. Below 200’ AGL on non-published
  routes, helicopters will comply with fixed wing chart requirements. MAJCOMs may
  approve use of AF Form 70 or equivalent navigation log when required. Note: If
  helicopter mission requirements dictate unplanned and uncharted routing, comply with
  AFI 11-2MDS-V3 chart requirements.

Figure 3.13. Sample Low Level Navigation Chart with Route.




      3.2.4.1. Turn Points. In tactical situations, avoid direct routes. Select turn points based
      on a balance between their ease of identification and the tactical situation. Label each
      turn point with the same identifier used in the flight plan.
      3.2.4.2. Course Lines. Normally straight lines between points but may be ―spaghetti‖
      routing to take advantage of terrain masking. Different tactical situations will dictate
      different transitions from one course to another at the turn points. Examples of
      transitions include: Radius of Turn, Curved Path, or simple Point to Point.
      3.2.4.3. Time, Distance, Fuel. Can be annotated in various ways on the chart and may
      show information just for the leg being flown or for the remainder of the route. Ensure
      that information does not cover up important map features. PFPS allows the user to set
      the transparency level of the ―dog-houses‖ so chart details can still be seen through them.
      3.2.4.4. Safe Altitudes. All charts must have Minimum Safe Altitudes (MSA) and at
      least one ESA (Also known as Emergency Route Abort Altitude or ERAA). An MSA is
      an initial VFR altitude that provides increased clearance from terrain or obstacles when
      dealing with minor circumstances that do not require an overall route abort. In the
      absence of more restrictive MAJCOM guidance, an MSA will be computed for each leg
      of the route by adding 500 feet to the highest obstruction to flight within 5 nm of route
      centerline to include the aircraft turn radius. ESA/ERAA is designed to provide
      positive IMC terrain clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low-
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  59


      level structure. Planners may compute several ESAs for route segments transiting
      significant terrain differentials, or a single ESA for the entire low-level route. In the
      absence of more restrictive MAJCOM guidance, compute ESA by adding 1,000 feet
      (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain as defined in AFI 11-202V3) to the elevation of the
      highest obstruction to flight within 22 nm either side of the entire planned route. The
      ESA(s) will be computed for the route and conspicuously annotated on the chart.
      3.2.4.5. Emergency Diverts. When available and applicable, each route should include
      clearly highlighted airfields that may be used if an immediate landing situation occurs on
      the route.
      3.2.4.6. Military Training Routes. To enhance scanning while flying the route, mission
      planners/pilots will annotate areas where IFR, VFR and slow speed low altitude routes
      (IR, VR, and SR) cross the planned route.
3.3. NOTAMS.
   3.3.1. Applicability of NOTAMs to VFR Flight. The FAA publishes NOTAMs IAW FAA
   Order 7930.2 (available under the Regulations & Policies tab at http://www.faa.gov). D
   NOTAMs are widely disseminated and available from any FSS. These NOTAMs include
   information pertinent to IFR and VFR operations. Examples of useful information to the
   VFR pilot include: taxiway closures, VASI outages, temporary obstructions on the airfield,
   etc. (L NOTAMS have been phased out and no longer exist as part of the FAA NOTAM
   system.)
   3.3.2. Special Interest Items for VFR Flight
      3.3.2.1. Tethered Balloons exist in various parts of the United States on cables that
      extend to altitudes greater than 10,000’ AGL. Locations of these balloons are depicted as
      restricted areas on DoD IFR Enroute Low Altitude charts as well as FAA Sectional
      charts.
      3.3.2.2. Glider and Parachute Operations are depicted with symbols on FAA Sectional
      charts. Glider or parachute activity may also be discussed in the IFR or VFR supplement
      or may be announced by NOTAM. If the airport where the activity originates is not in a
      supplement, a nearby listed airport may mention the activity. (e.g. Under El Paso Intl
      remarks: Sailplane and ultralight opr in vcnty of Horizon Arpt 8 nmNE of twy K1.)
      3.3.2.3. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) are a type of NOTAM that defines an area
      restricted to air travel due to a hazardous condition (forest fire fighting area), a special
      event (Olympic Torch path), a national security area (Disneyland), or an FAA airspace
      general warning. A current list of TFRs can be found at http://tfr.faa.gov. This site lists
      the TFRs and provides links to charts, text descriptions of the TFRs, and other useful
      information.
3.4. VFR Flight Plans.
   3.4.1. Transition from VFR-IFR and IFR-VFR. Information on how to file a composite
   (contains both IFR and VFR portions) flight plan is in FLIP GP Chapter 4. The main item of
   emphasis when transitioning between IFR and VFR is communication with ATC. If going
   from VFR to IFR, prior to the IFR segment, maintain VFR and contact the nearest FSS and
   request an IFR clearance. Once cleared by ATC to operate under IFR, cancel the VFR
 60                                                    AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010


   portion of the flight plan with a FSS. Conversely, if going from IFR to VFR, simply cancel
   IFR with ATC, then radio FSS and activate the VFR portion of the flight plan.
   3.4.2. VFR-on-Top. IAW AFI 11-202V3, MAJCOMs may authorize VFR on Top
   operations if a specific mission dictates. VFR-on-Top is ATC authorization for an aircraft on
   an IFR clearance to operate at VFR altitudes while maintaining required VFR cloud
   clearances and continuing to comply with applicable instrument flight rules. VFR-on-Top
   does not necessarily require the existence of clouds below the aircraft. It is just another way
   of operating IFR, allows the pilot a wider choice of altitudes to fly, and puts the
   responsibility on the pilot to see and avoid other aircraft. VFR-on-Top operations will not be
   authorized in Class A airspace.
   3.4.3. Defense VFR (DVFR). Allows aircraft to operate under VFR in the ADIZ. DVFR
   differs from VFR in that while operating DVFR in the ADIZ, the pilot must fly the flight-
   planned route unless otherwise cleared by ATC. Two way radio communications must be
   maintained and aircraft must have an operable transponder unless specifically cleared
   otherwise by ATC. No pilot may deviate from the filed DVFR flight plan unless that pilot
   notifies an appropriate aeronautical facility before deviating.
3.5. Navigation.
   3.5.1. Low Level Navigation.        What constitutes ―low level‖ will vary from one
   aircraft/mission to another. In general, consider any route flown below 1000’ AGL as low
   level. Flight in this environment requires increased preflight preparation, route study, chart
   complexity and attention while flying. Terrain, man-made obstacles, birds, enemy activity
   and reduced time to deal with aircraft emergencies, all make the low-level environment a
   more intense place to operate. The ability to operate undetected by the enemy or defeat
   enemy weapon systems mitigates the increased risk and validates low level navigation as a
   viable Air Force tactic.
   3.5.2. Terrain Masking/Contour Navigation. Aircraft operating in the low altitude
   environment may elect to enhance their threat avoidance capabilities by hiding their physical,
   radar, and heat signatures in the available terrain features. Along the low level route there
   may be vegetation or changes in elevation that can hide an aircraft from the enemy. Pilots
   should attempt to include terrain masking in their pre-flight route study so that off-course
   maneuvering does not negatively impact time over target (TOT) control. In some cases
   however, opportunities to terrain mask will not be evident until flying the route. Aggressive
   clearing and chart reading are essential to ensure that the benefits of terrain masking are not
   negated by unnecessarily increasing the overall risk factor of the mission.
   3.5.3. Time Control. Various techniques are used to control arrival time over the objective
   area. These techniques can be as simple as changing airspeed or more complicated
   applications of off-route maneuvering. Use caution when departing the planned route of
   flight, especially at night, to avoid encountering obstacles or flying into known areas of
   enemy activity when employing off-route time control techniques. If the off-course
   maneuvering exits the MSA corridor, a new MSA must be computed. This can be done
   quickly by adding 500 feet to the charted maximum sector elevation(s) in the off-course
   maneuvering area.

                            VFR DEPARTURE PROCEDURES

4.1. Communications Procedures.
   4.1.1. ATC Clearances. Even when flying VFR, pilots will comply with ATC instructions
   when in controlled airspace. When able, activate the VFR flight plan and obtain flight
   following prior to departure. In some instances, radio contact with ATC will not be possible
   on the ground and the flight plan must be activated through a FSS once airborne. The FSS
   will notify the destination airport or servicing FSS of the ETA.
   4.1.2. Transponder Operations. Pilots operating VFR in the NAS will squawk 1200 or an
   ATC assigned flight following code.
   4.1.3. Uncontrolled Airport Procedures It is very important when operating VFR from
   uncontrolled airports for pilots to be extremely vigilant for other aircraft both on the ground
   and in the air as well as other hazards to aircraft. When ready to depart, utilize the airport
   CTAF/UNICOM frequency to announce aircraft location, departure runway, intentions, and
   direction of flight after departure.
4.2. Climb Gradients and Obstacle Clearance. It is important to understand that even when
operating under VFR, if departing an airfield with a published instrument procedure, unless
specifically waived by the MAJCOM/A3, fixed-wing multi-engine aircraft must be able to
meet, OEI, any published IFR climb gradient for the planned departure path, IAW AFI 11-
202V3. Remember, flying under VFR in VMC does not bring your departure a level of safety
equivalent to an instrument procedure or TERPS review. Adhering to instrument standards as
reviewed by TERPS will produce quantifiable aircraft performance requirements that can be
evaluated by the pilot during mission planning. Under VMC, there is no assurance obstacles can
be avoided once identified in flight. If the airport has no published instrument procedure and
weather conditions allow a VFR departure, MAJCOM guidance, aircraft flight manuals,
operational risk management, and PIC discretion dictate whether aircraft performance and
obstacles will permit a safe departure.
4.3. Contingency Procedures.
   4.3.1. Aircraft Emergencies. Air Force pilots operating VFR must familiarize themselves
   with their departure airport in order to effectively deal with aircraft emergencies.
   Availability of emergency return runways (consider length, winds, barrier equipment, etc.),
   existence of hazardous obstructions, radio and ground based services, hot brake areas,
   arm/de-arm areas, etc. are all important items to know about the airfield prior to departure in
   case of an emergency return.
   4.3.2. Encounter with IMC. Anticipate IMC and alter route of flight to maintain VFR unless
   safety dictates otherwise. If unable to maintain VFR the pilot must immediately coordinate
   an IFR clearance and cancel the VFR flight plan with ATC or a FSS. (Refer to paragraph
   1.2.) Helicopters may request SVFR, where applicable, when the weather is below that
   required for the given airspace but above MDS-specific weather requirements. Limit the use
   of SVFR to mission essential as these procedures limit the traffic tower can allow in its
   airspace.

                             VFR ENROUTE PROCEDURES

5.1. Communications Procedures.
   5.1.1. ATC Clearances. When in controlled airspace, VFR pilots will comply with ATC
   instructions. If ATC clearances will cause an unsafe situation or cause the aircraft to
   enter IMC, notify ATC and request new instructions.
   5.1.2. Transponder Operations. VFR aircraft operating in the NAS (including SRs) will
   squawk either 1200 or an ATC assigned flight following code. VFR aircraft must still
   comply with TCAS RAs. Exception: Aircraft on a VR squawk 4000 (or ATC assigned
   code.) Aircraft operating in or near the Washington D.C. ADIZ/Special Flight Rules
   Area/Flight Restricted Area refer to appropriate publications for transponder procedures to
   prevent intercept.
   5.1.3. ATC Services
      5.1.3.1. Radar Assistance to VFR Aircraft. ATC may provide vectoring service to VFR
      aircraft. USAF pilots are encouraged to accept such assistance. Some ATCs have
      limited vectoring capability for weather avoidance, but the responsibility to remain in
      VFR conditions while on a VFR flight plan always belongs to the pilot.
      5.1.3.2. Flight Following. If requested by the pilot and ATC workload and equipment
      capability permits, flight following services will be provided. ATC should provide
      separation from IFR traffic and participating VFR traffic. Even while participating in
      flight following, the ultimate responsibility for traffic separation rests with the pilot.
      5.1.3.3. Flight Service Station. A Flight Service Station provides preflight briefings,
      NOTAMS, weather, flight plan filing, flight plan opening and closing, navaid monitoring,
      collection and dissemination of PIREPS, relay of information from ATC, traffic
      advisories (very general information, no radar capability), and emergency assistance.
      Flight Service Stations can be reached via land line at 1 800 WX BRIEF and by radio on
      frequencies published on FAA Sectionals and DoD Enroute charts.
          5.1.3.3.1. Enroute Flight Advisory Services (EFAS), also called Flight Watch,
          provide enroute weather updates. They can be contacted on 122.0 MHz anywhere in
          the United States. Because some EFAS areas overlap, specify an EFAS on initial
          contact. EFAS, unlike ATC, can usually provide very good weather radar
          information. When calling Flight Watch, state the name of the Flight Watch station
          (normally the same name as the FSS), aircraft call sign, and aircraft location in
          relation to a navaid, airport, or town.
          5.1.3.3.2. Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS) is continuous
          weather information broadcast over selected VOR frequencies. VORs with HIWAS
          service are identified by a small solid square inside the VOR’s frequency
          identification box. To listen to HIWAS information, turn up the volume on the VOR
          receiver just as if monitoring the VOR for identification.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  63


          5.1.3.3.3. Emergency Frequencies. If VFR and not in radio contact with ATC,
          emergency contact can be attempted on UHF Guard, 243.0 MHz or VHF Guard,
          121.5 MHz. These frequencies should only be used for emergencies or to contact
          ATC when no other contact method is available.
          5.1.3.3.4. Other Frequencies. For various reasons while flying under VFR, it may be
          necessary to contact a FSS or ATC facility (weather, change in destination, update an
          ETA, etc.) Carrying charts and other FLIP materials normally used for flight under
          IFR will prove very useful in such situations. Become familiar with the chart legends
          on Sectionals, VFR Terminal Area Charts, IFR Enroute Charts, as well as the VFR
          and IFR Enroute Supplements. Doing so will make locating required frequencies
          simple and fast. VHF 123.6 is a common airport advisory frequency.
          5.1.3.3.5. Remote Communications Outlets (RCOs). Many FSSs are equipped with
          RCOs and can transmit and receive on more than one frequency at more than one
          location. To enable the FSS specialist to utilize the correct transmitter, broadcast
          ―Any radio,‖ aircraft call sign and the nearest navaid. RSOs use frequencies 121.5
          and 255.4 as well as UHF and VHF Guard.
   5.1.4. Uncontrolled Airspace Procedures. No ATC services are provided in Class G
   (uncontrolled) airspace. VFR pilots must maintain cloud clearances IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   Clear aggressively, listen for position reports of other aircraft, and monitor TCAS for traffic
   information.
5.2. Enroute Navigation.
   5.2.1. Pilotage is the use of visual, radio, radar, GPS, etc. to navigate from one point to
   another while maintaining situational awareness. For VFR operations, Air Force crews
   typically navigate by referencing a route drawn on a chart, comparing it to landmarks on the
   ground while flying a precise heading and airspeed to stay on the route centerline. For a
   complete discussion on pilotage and clock-to-map-to-ground navigation, refer to Chapter 2 of
   this manual.
   5.2.2. Terrain and Obstacle Avoidance. One of the single most important tasks for pilots
   flying VFR routes, especially at night or in marginal weather conditions, is to maintain
   situational awareness in relation to terrain and obstacles. A thorough preflight route study
   coupled with aggressive chart reading and clearing techniques will minimize the possibility
   of contacting terrain or obstacles. One technique that is very effective involves looking
   ahead on the chart as the aircraft joins a new leg of the route. Once on the leg and clear
   ahead, the pilot or crew should spend a brief period studying the chart for potential hazards
   and discuss plans to avoid them if necessary. If training or the tactical situation do not
   require flight at lower altitudes, flying the route at or above a computed MSA will negate
   most terrain and obstacles.
   5.2.3. Military Training Routes (MTR) MTRs allow flight below 10,000 feet MSL at speeds
   greater than 250 KIAS. A description of the Military Training Route program can be found
   in AIM Chapter 3 Military Training Routes. Procedures for utilizing MTRs are found in
   FLIP AP/1B Chapters 1 and 2. A more detailed discussion of MTRs can be found in Chapter
   2 of this manual.
5.3. Contingency Procedures.

   5.3.1. Aircraft Emergencies. As with any aircraft emergency, the primary task of the pilot
   operating VFR is to maintain aircraft control and avoid terrain and obstacles. If an aircraft
   emergency occurs while operating in the low level environment, unless specific MDS
   procedures (i.e. helicopter precautionary landing) dictate otherwise, a climb to the MSA or
   higher will be initiated as soon as possible. The pilot must maintain situational awareness
   while dealing with the emergency. Clearing for other aircraft and knowing where the aircraft
   is in relation to obstacles, various types of airspace, and emergency divert airfields are
   critical to a successful recovery.
   5.3.2. Lost Aircraft. If flying VFR using dead reckoning and you think you are lost,
   continue to navigate clock to map to ground and turn on time. Many times a slight off-course
   condition can be quickly corrected once on a new leg of the course with more prominent
   ground references. While doing this, climb to a higher altitude (weather permitting), being
   careful to maintain airspeed to preserve dead reckoning accuracy. This will conserve fuel
   while improving navaid and radio reception. Attempt to tune and identify navaids that can
   provide positional information and do not delay declaring your condition to ATC. If you find
   visual references that you recognize, make sure to use more than one thing to verify the
   reference for what it is. (e.g. airports, towers, lakes, etc.)
   5.3.3. Route Abort. Various situations may make abandoning the route necessary (e.g. low
   fuel, aircraft emergency, bad weather, etc.) No abort will be the same and pilots must
   exercise good judgment when choosing a new altitude and route of flight. In most
   emergency situations, climbing to the ESA is the best course of action. Flying at the ESA
   will ensure that the aircraft is clear of obstructions and will minimize hazards to flight while
   abort procedures are applied. Aborting the route itself does not constitute an emergency and
   pilots must take all factors into consideration when deciding how to proceed after the abort.
   5.3.4. Encounter with IMC. The key to dealing with IMC when flying VFR is early
   recognition and aggressive decision making. Pilots must remember that flying into IMC is
   not only prohibited while VFR, it immediately and dramatically increases the risk factor of
   the flight. At the first sign that the weather may prevent continued flight under VFR, unless
   safety dictates otherwise, alter the route to maintain VFR, decide what options remain for a
   destination, and, if required, coordinate an IFR clearance with ATC. If flying into IMC
   cannot be safely avoided before a safe landing can be made or gaining a clearance from
   ATC, climb immediately to the appropriate minimum safe altitude for the type of airspace,
   utilize all tools available to keep clear of obstacles and other traffic (i.e. TCAS, radar, etc.)
   and continue to attempt contact with ATC for a clearance. If a landing is made off-airport
   (e.g. VTOL aircraft) without the permission of the property owner, note GPS position and
   notify your chain of command as soon as possible.
5.4. Low Level Time to Impact (TTI).
   5.4.1. Time to Impact- Wings Level (Table 3.1.) At low altitudes, loss of situational
   awareness can lead to an insidious descent rate. As the following charts show, even a minor
   nose-low attitude can result in terrain impact in a very short time. With wings level, the time
   differences based on pitch, altitude, and airspeed are all linear. (e.g. Cutting the altitude in
   half or doubling the nose-low pitch angle will both cut the time to impact in half.) Historical
   data shows that while 90% of low level operations are straight and level, only 9% of low
   level accidents occur during straight and level flight. Conversely, turning and looking
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     65


   accounts for only 5% of low level flight but 52% of accidents. This demonstrates that
   clearing ahead for terrain must be a priority while maneuvering at low altitudes.

   5.4.2. Time to Impact – Banked. The majority of low level accidents occur while the aircraft
   is in a bank. Even the smallest distraction or inattention to the proximity of terrain while
   maneuvering the aircraft can result in a loss of situational awareness and a fatal accident.
   The more bank used, the more Gs needed to maintain level flight. For instance, in 30° of
   bank, 1.15 Gs must be maintained in order to prevent a descent. In 60° of bank, 2 Gs are
   required. Above 60° the amount of Gs required to maintain altitude increases dramatically
   and it follows therefore that the descent generated by overbanking without holding the
   required Gs will be significant. At low altitudes this means a very short time to impact. The
   following chart (Table 3.2.) shows just how little time there is from 500’ if a pilot holds the
   Gs for one bank angle but flies in an overbanked condition. Considering that many aircraft
   fly low levels at 300’ AGL and normally use a 60° bank angle to turn from one course to
   another (or even higher bank angles during simulated threat avoidance), a 20° overbank error
   could result in less than 3 seconds time-to-impact. This demonstrates how critical it is for
   pilots to prioritize attention to flight parameters, terrain and cockpit duties. (Helicopters have
   additional flight characteristics to consider in banked flight. Refer to MDS specific flight
   manuals for cautions and warnings specific to banked flight at low altitudes.)

                                           Chapter 6

                               VFR ARRIVAL PROCEDURES

6.1. Pilot Responsibilities. Prior to descending into the airport area obtain an update to the
weather forecast (if available). Ensure the field conditions will still permit a VFR arrival and
consider a descent profile that will conserve fuel and allow for a stable approach to the intended
landing surface.
6.2. Communications Procedures.
   6.2.1. ATC Clearances.         Class C, D and E (when in an airport traffic area) airspace
   procedures require pilots operating under VFR to maintain two-way radio
   communications with ATC. Two-way communication includes ATC using the VFR
   aircraft’s call sign in the radio call. ―Calling LUBBOCK Approach, stand by.‖ for instance,
   does not qualify as two-way communications. Pilots must obtain a clearance into Class B
   airspace from ATC prior to entering Class B airspace. Sectionals and VFR Terminal Area
   Charts include flag symbols designating geographical points familiar to ATC around some
   Class B, C, and D airspace that allow VFR aircraft to make accurate initial position reports.
   6.2.2. Transponder Operations. In the NAS, VFR aircraft will squawk 1200 unless
   assigned a transponder code by ATC. Aircraft operating in the Washington D.C. area
   must follow specific transponder procedures or risk intercept.
   6.2.3. Controlled Airport Procedures. When arriving at a controlled airport, contact ATC
   (Approach Control or the Tower) and advise them of call sign, position and intentions.
   Traffic permitting, ATC will normally allow a VFR aircraft to self-navigate to the landing
   runway. However, if traffic dictates otherwise, VFR aircraft can expect ATC to provide
   vectors and altitudes to maintain separation.
   6.2.4. Uncontrolled Airport Procedures. Communication and clearing are paramount when
   operating into uncontrolled airfields. If unfamiliar with the airfield and preflight information
   is minimal, it may be prudent to fly over the airport and check the airfield for potential
   hazards prior to flying the approach and landing. Runway construction, vehicles, animals
   and various other obstacles and hazards may not be visible from the final approach point of
   view. See also Figure 6.1. for recommended communication at uncontrolled airports. When
   maneuvering in the VFR traffic pattern or taxiing, frequently broadcast position and
   intentions on the appropriate frequency (usually UNICOM or Common Traffic Advisory
   Frequency (CTAF).) For example, ―Potosi traffic, TRACK 10, left base, runway 17 right,
   touch and go.‖

   6.2.5. Closing VFR Flight Plans. VFR flight plans are not automatically closed. USAF
   pilots will notify ATC by any means available to ensure their VFR flight plan is closed.
   Failure to ensure a VFR flight plan is closed within ½ hour of the ETA will cause initiation
   of search and rescue efforts.
6.3. VFR Helicopter Operations at Controlled Airports. Helicopters should avoid the flow
of fixed-wing aircraft traffic patterns unless they can maintain a compatible speed.
6.4. Landing.
   6.4.1. Day. Use all available information (navaids, runway diagrams, terrain features, etc.)
   to ensure you are at the correct airport. There are many instances of very similar airports
   being located close to one-another resulting in aircraft landing at the wrong destination. (e.g.
   El Paso International and Biggs Army Air Field.) Use appropriate visual and instrument
   references (e.g. VASI, ILS) to help fly the approach. Many airports have visual illusions
   associated with certain runways that can be overcome by using these assets.
   6.4.2. Night. Along with the techniques and recommended practices in the above paragraph,
   night VFR approaches require a thorough study of the final approach area. Darkness can
   mask terrain features and obstacles that may become a factor when flying a final approach at
   night. Pilots should also be aware of the ―black hole‖ effect when flying a final turn type of
   approach to a runway with minimal surrounding cultural lighting. Because the runway will
   appear to rest in a black featureless plain, pilots tend to fly the final turn high and end up very
   steep once on final approach. This can result in high descent rates on final and potentially
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                               69


  hard landings. Combat this effect by monitoring descent rates throughout the final turn and
  cross checking against visual glidepath guidance, if available. It is possible, especially at
  night, for IMC to become a factor without warning. If at any time visual conditions
  deteriorate and make a safe approach questionable, immediately perform a go-around and
  climb in the safest direction for obstacle and traffic avoidance. Contact ATC for an IFR
  clearance and instructions.

                                            Chapter 7

                                 ICAO VFR PROCEDURES

7.1. Introduction.
   7.1.1. Conventions. Variations to standard US VFR operations are published in the
   appropriate FLIP Area Planning (AP/1, 2, etc.) product. Variations include non-standard
   VFR cloud clearances, restrictions to VFR traffic in certain types of controlled airspace, VFR
   enroute altitudes, etc.
   7.1.2. Compliance. In the absence of theater MAJCOM guidance, USAF pilots will review
   and comply with the applicable Area Planning product or host nation AIP for ICAO VFR.
   During contingency operations, theater MAJCOMs may produce variations to the VFR
   procedures in the SPINS, ACO, etc. (See Chapter 8)
7.2. Operations in International Airspace. Unless MAJCOM or contingency guidance
specifies otherwise, pilots operating in international airspace will file an IFR flight plan (DD
Form 1801) and comply with ATC instructions and procedures. The following discussion on
Due Regard procedures covers the rare instances where IFR flight procedures conflict with the
parameters of US Air Force missions.
   7.2.1. Operating due regard can only be accomplished in international airspace. Full
   explanation of due regard operations can be found in DoD FLIP GP Chapter 8. Aircraft
   should normally adhere to ICAO procedures and control when operating in international
   airspace but if certain specific conditions are met, due regard may be utilized to accomplish
   the mission.
   7.2.2. International airspace exists over the high seas at any point greater than 12 miles
   offshore of a coastal state. Some nations claim more than 12 miles offshore. Refer to
   diplomatic clearances and the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) for specific guidance on
   sovereign territory avoidance procedures.
   7.2.3. Examples of situations where due regard is appropriate are: Military contingencies,
   classified missions, politically sensitive missions, routine aircraft carrier operations or other
   training activities. These are not all inclusive but give the general idea of the types of
   situations where due regard can be utilized. Due regard should not be used, for instance,
   because you are not happy with the routing you receive from air traffic control.
   7.2.4. According to DoD FLIP GP 8-8, operations not conducted under ICAO flight
   procedures are conducted under the ―Due Regard‖ or ―operational‖ prerogative of military
   aircraft and are subject to one or more of the following conditions:
       7.2.4.1. Aircraft shall be operated in Visual Meteorological Conditions; or
       7.2.4.2. Aircraft shall be operated         within      radar    surveillance   and    radio
       communications of a surface radar facility; or
       7.2.4.3. Aircraft shall be equipped with airborne radar sufficient to provide separation
       between themselves, aircraft they control, and other aircraft; or
       7.2.4.4. Aircraft shall be operated outside controlled airspace.
AFMAN11-217V2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   71


   7.2.5. Flight under above provisions shall be regarded as deviations from normally
   accepted operating procedures and practices, and shall not be undertaken
   routinely. Except for missions preplanned to operate under due regard, pilots or
   Commanders exercising “Due Regard” authority shall record the details in writing, and
   upon request from higher authority, furnish a detailed report. (IAW AFI 11-202V3 1.7.2)
7.3. Altimeter Setting Procedures. ATC terminology and procedures vary widely in ICAO
nations regarding altitudes and altimeter setting procedures. Many nations give altitudes in
meters instead of feet. Many give altimeter settings in millibars instead of inches. Additionally,
the transition level where the standard altimeter setting is used varies widely from one country to
another. In some cases the transition level/transition altitude may be below 3000 feet. Pilots
must be aware of the altimeter procedures used by the country they will be operating in and if
their instruments do not automatically convert between one convention and the other, they must
have access to a method to make the conversion manually. Most importantly, pilots operating
between countries that have significantly different altimeter procedures must be extremely
vigilant for mistakes that might put the aircraft at risk.
   7.3.1. QNE. Refers to operations where the altimeter is set to standard conditions of either
   29.92 inches of mercury or 1013.2 hectopascals or millibars. This setting is normally used at
   and above the transition level and normally applies to IFR flight. However, in some
   countries the transition level is low enough that VFR flight may need to set QNE.
   7.3.2. QNH. Local station pressure causes the altimeter to show the aircraft’s height above
   Mean Sea Level. When on the ground, the altimeter should show the airport MSL elevation.
   7.3.3. QFE. Local station pressure causes the altimeter to show the aircraft’s height above
   airport elevation. When on the ground, the altimeter should read zero. Only used in a few
   countries but making a mistake flying VFR at night could result in less than desirable
   obstacle clearance.
7.4. Airspeed Procedures. As with other ICAO procedures, airspeed limitations for VFR
aircraft vary widely from one country to the next. Pilots will refer to and comply with the FCG,
appropriate FLIP Area Planning publications and/or any theater MAJCOM guidance to
determine appropriate/maximum VFR airspeeds.
7.5. Communications Procedures.
   7.5.1. ATC Services. As indicated by the preceding information, VFR procedures in ICAO
   airspace can vary dramatically from one area to another. In general, aircraft can expect that
   ATC involvement under VFR will be much more prevalent in ICAO airspace than in FAA
   airspace. Just as in FAA airspace, aircraft operating under VFR in ICAO airspace are still
   required to comply with ATC instructions.
   7.5.2. Uncontrolled Airspace. ATC separation is not provided but traffic information may
   be given if practical. Class G airspace exists where ATC does not have radar or radio
   coverage. Therefore, pilots operating under VFR in Class G airspace must be particularly
   vigilant and use all available resources to see and avoid other air traffic.
   7.5.3. Transponder Operations. The VFR squawk in ICAO airspace is 7000. In general, this
   is only used in uncontrolled airspace. While under VFR in any ICAO controlled airspace,
   aircraft will normally be in contact with ATC on an ATC assigned squawk.

                    THEATER AND CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS

8.1. Contingency Operations. Due to wartime or contingency conditions, flight under VFR in
foreign airspace may be altered by theater commanders in order to enhance mission capability,
improve flexibility, or deconflict various weapon systems operating in confined airspace. Pilots
must have a thorough knowledge of all theater-specific rules governing VFR flight and must
frequently review the SPINS, ATO, ACO, FCIF, and other MAJCOM guidance to ensure safe
and effective mission accomplishment.
8.2. Special Instructions (SPINS). Similar to Rules of Engagement (ROE), SPINS define the
theater-specific guidance. With respect to flight under VFR, the SPINS may alter the normal
VFR procedures that exist in a country during non-contingency operations. Failure to study and
apply the information found in the SPINS may result in unsafe or illegal conduct punishable by
the UCMJ.
8.3. Local Directives. Despite contingency guidance for VFR flight, pilots must still be aware
of local directives governing VFR flight that are not covered or changed by MAJCOM
publications. Avoiding noise or culturally sensitive areas and complying with host nation rules
when they don’t conflict with approved MAJCOM deviations will foster good will between
nations and further enhance the US Air Force mission.
8.4. Air Tasking Order (ATO). The Air Tasking Order contains individual aircraft mission
taskings listed chronologically for a single day. Each item on the ATO will have various details
depending on the mission. In the following example, the listings are for several four-ship flights
of A-10s and F-15s. Figure 8.1 is notional and exists purely as an example. Working with the
mission planning cell or tactics office to learn how to read or ―break out‖ an ATO is an important
operational skill that can enhance flexibility, mission effectiveness and ability to interact with
other theater assets.

8.5. Airspace Control Orders (ACO). The Airspace Control Order (Figure 8.2.) is published
either as a separate document or as part of the ATO and is the primary means of the airspace
control authority in various theaters to disseminate approved airspace control measures. The
ACO complements the ATO cycle and may be published several times daily. The ACO is
developed by the airspace control center of the TACC. With respect to VFR, it is important to
realize that ACO operations may resemble IFR and VFR simultaneously. The routing through
portions of the airspace may be very structured like an IFR airway. Yet the pilot may be
operating autonomously with some flexibility in altitude, maneuvering and need to employ see-
and-avoid. Pilots must be very familiar with the rules of the airspace they are utilizing (which
may differ from the rules that applied to that same airspace on previous editions of the ACO) as

well as the times they are authorized to use the airspace and the times it is authorized for
missions ahead of and behind them.
