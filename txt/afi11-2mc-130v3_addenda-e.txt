                                                Chapter 1

                                                POLICY

1.1. General. Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of variations are
available and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most typical encountered day
to day.

1.2. Responsibilities. Personnel engaged in planning operations must consider the most appropriate con-
figuration that will satisfy mission requirements and permit minimum variations and man-hours to
change. Units performing services on AFSOC C-130E/H aircraft (e.g., maintenance, life support) are
responsible for configuring the aircraft In Accordance With (IAW) this instruction and as outlined in mis-
sion directives to include the stowage/installation of equipment IAW the configuration and equipment
tables outlined herein.

1.3. Codes. Use the following codes when referring to C-130E/H cargo compartment configuration. The
letter code will be followed by a number identifying configuration capability.
    1.3.1. AE – Aeromedical Evacuation
    1.3.2. C – Cargo
    1.3.3. CP – Cargo and Passengers
    1.3.4. LP – Psychological Operations
    1.3.5. P – Passenger
    1.3.6. RAPID – Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel
    1.3.7. TAC – Tactical Airdrop Cargo
    1.3.8. TAP – Tactical Airdrop Personnel

1.4. Modifications. The coded configurations of this regulation may require modification for a specific
mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission execution to ensure maximum
flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment. Each mission directive will identify the basic con-
figuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy mission requirements. For example, a
cargo mission may require additional seats or equipment such as a bulldog winch not in the C-cargo con-
figuration. Indicate the mission directive configuration C (number as applicable) and modification, e.g.,
two additional seats and bulldog winch required.

1.5. Weight and Balance.
    1.5.1. Configuration and necessary equipment changes to conduct special operations missions affect
    the weight and balance of the aircraft. To standardize equipment and the location of equipment, items
    shown in Table 2.1. will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft
    except for maintenance, inspection and when removal is directed by this Air Force Instruction (AFI).
    Equipment listed in Table 2.2. will be added as necessary and entered on DD Form 365-4, Weight and
    Balance Clearance Form F, reference 5, 6, or 7. For simplicity the loadmaster will (when preparing
    the DD Form 365-4 Form F) enter the weight contained in the equipment tables for the applicable con-
AFI11-2MC-130V3_ADDENDA-E 2 JUNE 2008                                                                     5


   figuration. Adjustments will be made when the actual on-board weight of an item varies from data
   shown. DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5.
   1.5.2. When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1. is accomplished at a For-
   ward Operating Location and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and balance authority is
   deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the AFTO Form 781A, Main-
   tenance Discrepancy and Work Document indicating the weight, fuselage station and moment of any
   equipment added or removed. The loadmaster will add or subtract the listed weight and moment from
   the last entry in the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. Annotate the new weight and moment in Block 1 of DD
   365-4. Configuration changes accomplished at home station require a QA update to the DD Form
   365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record. EXCEPTION: Minor equipment changes after
   crew reporting may be annotated on the DD Form 365-4, by the loadmaster.

1.6. Distribution. Commanders are responsible for bringing this publication to the attention of all
affected personnel. At least one copy will be maintained in the unit operations section. It will be readily
accessible to operations and aircrew personnel. Additional distribution will be as follows:
   1.6.1. Staff operations, all levels.
   1.6.2. All levels of aircrew standardization offices.
   1.6.3. Command posts/operations centers.
   1.6.4. Air terminal operations centers.
   1.6.5. Aerial Delivery Support Branch/Aerial Delivery Flight.
   1.6.6. Aircraft maintenance squadrons/units, Dash 21 equipment sections, Quality Assurance sec-
   tions.
   1.6.7. Aircrew Life Support sections.
   1.6.8. One located in the supplemental weight and balance handbook binder on each aircraft.
   1.6.9. One copy to each C-130E/H loadmaster.

1.7. Revisions. All revisions will consist of electronic interim change or new publication. Personnel at all
echelons are encouraged to make recommendations to improve this instruction. Direct proposed changes,
to AFSOC/A3V in accordance with AFI 11-202 Vol 2, General Flight Rules, Attachment 5 and AFI
11-215, Flight Manuals Program,, Attachment 3. Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication.

1.8. Supplements. Subordinate unit supplements to this instruction that change the basic policies, proce-
dures, or formats prescribed herein are prohibited. Exception: Groups may supplement Table 2.2. with
additional items. They may also supplement Chapter 3 with specified configuration modifications to
accommodate theater unique requirements. Forward supplements to HQ AFSOC/A3V for approval.

1.9. Aircrew Life Support Requirements. Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. reflect minimum numbers and the
prescribed locations on the aircraft.

Notes:
1. Minimum equipment required. Units may add more equipment to meet specific mission or theater
requirements. At all times the amount of tiedown equipment required will include enough equipment to
secure the landing gear in an emergency as well as secure all cargo and loose equipment. When
additional equipment is added, QA will update the DD Form 365-3. (See exception in paragraph 1.5. of
this AFI.)
2. Minimum number of ground loading ramps required. More ramps will be added for RAPID
configurations. Generation IV ramps are the only type authorized for RAPID configurations. A full set
of Canary Slides may be used in lieu of ground loading ramps.
3. Minimum life support equipment required IAW AFI 11-301, Aircrew Life Support Program, Volume

4. The number of raft spaces dictates the total number of personnel (crew and passengers) that may be
on the aircraft for over-water missions. In other words, if you have three 20 man rafts installed you can
only have 60 personnel, including crew, on board for over-water missions.
5. All two-gallon emergency water containers will be stored empty. If mission dictates, containers will
be sanitized and filled with water by support personnel. Annotate in 781K emergency water containers
are full. After the mission, sanitize and dry containers then reinstall. When the water containers are
filled the DD Form 365-3 will be updated to reflect the added weight. (See exception in paragraph 1.5.
of this AFI.)

                          CARGO COMPARTMENT CONFIGURATION

3.1. Configuration. This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configurations for the C-130E/H
Aircraft. Although deviations to the basic configuration are authorized to meet special requirements, the
following factors should be considered:
   3.1.1. Side-wall and wheel-well seats should be installed/stowed on all missions unless otherwise
   depicted by this instruction regulation. One-man side-wall seats will not be used unless connected to
   a two-man seat.
   3.1.2. The normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches: However, spacing is as the mission dictates.
   Aircraft without accommodations for 24 inch spacing will be configured in 20 inch spacing.
   3.1.3. For flight, the weight limit on the aircraft ramp is limited to 4,664 pounds of palletized cargo in
   pallet position six, including the weight of pallet and nets, or 4,824 pounds floor loaded cargo (ramp
   intermediate conveyors removed and stowed forward of ramp). See T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading
   Manual, for other restrictions.
   3.1.4. Drawings in this volume are not drawn to scale with respect to actual aircraft locations.
   3.1.5. Safety aisle requirements are depicted in paragraph 4.2. and Figure 4.1.
   3.1.6. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, maintain a 30-inch
   space between cargo and the nearest forward litter, occupied seat or nuclear cargo. When cargo, either
   palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, 30-inch spacing is not required.
   Exception: Always maintain the 30-inch spacing on Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) missions, when
   carrying litters.

                                             REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.

4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following emergency
exits and safety aisles are available.
     4.2.1. At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed.
     4.2.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops. This does
     not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress. Litters and
     seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered as an obstruction.
     4.2.3. When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisle way will be maintained in the wheel
     well (pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits. In
     the wheel well area the aisle way will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the
     cargo and the aircraft and will begin at the cargo floor (Figure 4.1. A). Tiedown equipment (463L
     nets, straps, chains, and devices) shall not normally be considered an obstruction. The aisle way
     should normally be on the left side of the aircraft. If the aisle way is placed on the right side of the air-
     craft, then clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained. The dual rail outboard frame
     provides 8 inches of the 14 inch requirement on the main cargo floor. In the ramp area the aisle way
     will be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the dual rail frame. Access to aft
     latrine facilities requires an 18-inch clear area on the forward right side of the cargo loaded on the
     ramp.
     4.2.4. If safety aisle requirements in 4.2.3. can not be achieved on missions carrying crew only or
     mission essential personnel authorized by operations order/plan or COMAFSOF, then a safety aisle
     will be maintained in the wheel well area to provide the following minimum clearance (Figure 4.1.
     B).
         4.2.4.1. At least 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning no
         higher than 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform.
         4.2.4.2. Or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning
         no higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform.
     4.2.5. During airdrop missions, loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to accomplish
     tactical checklists.
     4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of
     the aircraft. The aircraft commander will be the final authority for determining if safety aisles and/or
     access aft of cargo is adequate. Cargo loads in chapter 6 of T.O.1C-130A-9 are specific and do not
     require a waiver.

                                                 Chapter 5

                                   DD FORM 365-4 INSTRUCTIONS

5.1. Introduction. This chapter provides instructions for computation and completion of DD Form
365-4. The Form F will be computed using simplified moments. The DD Form 365-4 will be computed
manually, or with the approved C-130 Automated Form F (AFF) program. All entries and signatures must
be legible.

5.2. Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the loaded aircraft
will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition. Consideration must
be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency jettisoning. Math, charts contained in
T.O. 1C-130E-5, Basic Weight Checklist and Loading Data, the C-130 AFF program and aircraft load
adjuster (slide rule) are tools which may be used for load planning. When the fuel load is unknown, load
plan for a 20-22 percent of Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC) zero fuel.

5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to forms using simplified moments. Entries on the
form may be either typed, handwritten, or computer entered (See C-130 AFF training guide for detailed
instructions).
     5.3.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number, departure
     and destination station (name or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier), air-
     craft’s home station and pilot's rank and last name.
     5.3.2. Limitations Column. Enter appropriate weight and C/G limits for the planned mission using the
     following criteria: The maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits specified in T.O.1C-130E/
     H -1 or T.O.1C-130E(E)-1, Flight Manual or will not be exceeded. Gross weight may also be limited
     by operating conditions; i.e., obstacle clearance, rate of climb, weather conditions, altitude, runway/
     taxiway bearing capacity, or any other published restrictions. The pilot/flight engineer will inform the
     loadmaster of any gross weight restrictions prior to the mission so an accurate allowable cabin load
     (ACL) may be obtained.
        5.3.2.1. Takeoff ACL. Unless other restrictions are imposed, use 155,000 allowable gross weight
        for C-130E/H aircraft, and subtract the total aircraft weight (Reference 12).
        5.3.2.2. Landing ACL. Unless other landing restrictions are imposed, use 155,000 for C-130E/H
        aircraft, and subtract operating weight plus estimated landing fuel (References 9 and 23).
        5.3.2.3. Limiting Wing Fuel. Compute IAW limiting wing fuel charts in Table 5.1. of this instruc-
        tion or the charts in section V of T.O.1C-130E/H-1, Flight Manual and T.O.1C-130E(E)-1 for
        takeoff and landing. The most restrictive weight will be used.

NOTES:
The limiting wing fuel chart in this instruction is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with indicated air-
speed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual limiting wing fuel charts. When specific mis-
sion requirements exceed the limitations outlined in area "C" of the limiting wing fuel charts, the
loadmaster must compute limitations using the appropriate flight manual limiting wing fuel chart in sec-
tion V of T.O.1C-130E/H-1 and T.O.1C-130E(E)-1.

Enter the allowable gross weight for limiting wing fuel and subtract the operating weight (Reference 9) to
determine limiting wing fuel allowable cabin load (ACL).
       5.3.2.4. Permissible C/G Takeoff and Landing. Compute the forward and aft center of gravity lim-
       itations using the center of gravity table in T.O.1C-130E-5. The permissible Center of Gravity
       (CG) zero fuel weight blocks will be left blank.

5.5. Limiting Wing Fuel. Table 5.1. may be used to determine maximum limiting wing fuel ACL for a
given fuel load when in primary fuel management. Comply with the requirements outlined in paragraph
AFI11-2MC-130V3_ADDENDA-E 2 JUNE 2008                                                                47


5.5.1. when using Table 5.1. Fuel weights are expressed in thousands. For fuel weights between chart
weights, go to nearest fuel weight to determine base weight. Both takeoff and landing conditions must be
calculated. The most restrictive will be placed on the DD-365-4.
   5.5.1. Instructions for primary fuel management. Table 5.1. is based on the recommended areas
   (Areas A, B, and C) of the Weight Limitations Chart (Primary Fuel Management) (Non Air Refueling
   Mission) With Foam In Fuel Tanks. For Operations that do not meet these criteria, use the appropriate
   chart in T.O. 1C-130E/H-1 or T.O. 1C-130E(E)-1Section V, to determine ACL.
