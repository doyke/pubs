PART I

Preface
1. The changing Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) and Air and
Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) environments require vision, preparation, and attention to ensure
people have the right skills and tools to deliver the C4I capabilities and the support required by the war
fighter in meeting the Air Force mission of today and the vision of the future. Declining resources,
expanding diversity of mission, and ever-changing technologies in the Air Force are impacting the
availability of our most valuable resource--people. These factors will continue to exist in the future, making
it essential for the work force to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level
of an Air Force Specialty (AFS). To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the Air Force must place a greater
emphasis on career field training. This Spectrum Operations Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP) is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle training/education
requirements, support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 3D1X4 specialty. The plan
is a "training road map" for the career field. It provides personnel a clear career path to success and
makes career field training identifiable, measurable, and budget defensible.

2. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life cycle education and
training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.
The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts. Management uses both
parts in conjunction with the Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage, and control training within the
career field. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position
qualification training.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty
qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); and Section D indicates resource
constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition
training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes
duties, tasks, TRs to support training, AETC conducted training, wartime course and core tasks and
correspondence course requirements. Section B: contains the Course Objectives List (COL) and training
standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C: identifies
available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package, which may be developed to
support proficiency training; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine
resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E
identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training
required for the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to
identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

3. Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training
for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers. This plan enables the Air Force
to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

Force personnel. AETC also provides pre-commissioning, professional military, and continuing education.
Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM). Representative appointed by the respective HQ USAF Deputy
Chief of Staff or Under Secretariat to ensure that assigned Air Force specialties are trained and utilized to
support Air Force mission requirements.
Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). The official directory for all military enlisted
classification descriptions, codes, and identifiers. Establishes the occupational structure of the Air Force
enlisted force. The occupational structure is flexible to permit enlisted personnel to specialize and develop
their skills and abilities while allowing the Air Force to meet changing mission requirements. Individual
enlisted personnel have a joint responsibility with commanders and supervisors at all levels to fully develop
their abilities consistent with Air Force needs and within the established patterns of specialization.
Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS). A comprehensive task list that describes a particular job
type or duty position. Supervisors use the AFJQS to document task qualification. The tasks on AFJQSs
are common to all persons serving in the described duty position.

Operations and Standards for additional information/requirements.
Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) Code. CEM codes identify all chief master sergeant positions in the
Enlisted Classification Structure. They also identify chief master sergeants who, through extensive
experience and training, have demonstrated managerial ability to plan, direct, coordinate, implement, and
control a wide range of work activity. Some managerial duties and responsibilities that are common to all
chief enlisted managers are: managing and directing personnel resource activities; interpreting and
enforcing policy and applicable directives; establishing control procedures to meet work goals and
standards; recommending or initiating actions to improve functional operation efficiency; planning and
programming work commitments, and schedules; developing plans regarding facilities, supplies, and
equipment procurement and maintenance.
Collaboration. Collaboration is the interaction among two or more individuals encompassing a variety of
behaviors including: communication, information sharing, coordination, cooperation, problem-solving, and
negotiation.
Collaborative Tools. Collaborative tools consist of various web-based technologies including advanced
white boarding, groupware, and facilitation. Collaborative capabilities assist significantly with managing
information throughout its life cycle and enable Air Force members to perform most office-oriented and
operational communication tasks from their desktops.
Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(C4ISR). Integrated systems of doctrine, procedures, organizational structures, personnel, equipment,
facilities, and communications designed to support a commander’s exercise of command and control

other tasks. Tasks may be defined as critical either through AFI, Technical Orders, higher headquarters, or
at any level in the unit.
Data Management. The process of planning, coordinating, sharing, and controlling organizations’ data
resources (AFPD 33-3, Information Management).
Document Management (DM). The process of managing documents through their life cycle; from
inception through creation, review, storage, dissemination, and archival or deletion. Document
management can also be a database system to organize stored documents, or a search mechanism to
quickly find specific documents (AFPD 33-3).
Direct Reporting Unit (DRU). Air Force subdivisions directly subordinate to the CSAF. A DRU performs a
mission that does not fit into any of the MAJCOMs. A DRU has many of the same administrative and
organizational responsibilities as a MAJCOM (Example of a DRU: USAF Academy).
Duty Position Tasks. The tasks assigned to an individual for the position currently held. These include,
at a minimum, all core tasks that correspond to the duty position, and tasks assigned by the supervisor (AFI
36-2201).
Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA). Located at https://etca.randolph.af.mil, the
ETCA contains specific MAJCOM procedures, fund cite instructions, reporting instructions, and listings for
those formal courses the MAJCOMs or FOAs conduct or manage. The ETCA contains courses the Air
Force and reserve forces conduct or administer and serves as a reference for the Air Force, DoD, other
military services, government agencies, and security assistance programs.
Enlisted Specialty Training (EST). A mix of formal training (technical school) and informal training
(on-the-job) to qualify and upgrade airmen in each skill level of a specialty.
Enterprise. The entire range of communications/networking within garrison and tactical realms to include
voice, video, data, imagery, and sensor.
Enterprise Information Management (EIM). Encompasses a set of strategies for organizational
management of all aspects of enterprise data as information assets. The proper models, data architecture,
application architecture, and integration vision enables using the “enterprise information asset” for strategic
analysis, customer-centricity, performance and productivity analytics, and personalization, eventually
providing a means for transitioning from an operational, line-of-business oriented application environment,
to an intelligent, learning, and agile organization.
Expeditionary Aerospace Force (EAF). The EAF concept is how the Air Force will organize, train, equip,
and sustain itself by creating a mindset and cultural state that embraces the unique characteristics of
aerospace power – range, speed, flexibility, precision – to meet the national security challenges of the 21st
Century.
Exportable Training. Additional training via computer assisted, paper text, interactive video, or other
necessary means to supplement training.
Field Operating Agency (FOA). FOAs are subdivisions of the Air Force directly subordinate to a
headquarters US Air Force functional manager. A FOA performs field activities beyond the scope of any of
the MAJCOMs. The activities are specialized or associated with an Air Force-wide mission (Example of a
FOA is the Air Force Weather Agency).
Field Training. Technical, operator, and other training that either a field training detachment or field
training team conducts at operational locations on specific systems and associated direct-support
equipment for maintenance and aircrew personnel.

personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support operational planning and execution.
Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, developing and reviewing policy; developing, managing, and
maintaining Unit Type Codes (UTC); developing criteria for and monitoring readiness reporting; force
posturing; and analysis. At each level of responsibility (Headquarters Air Force, MAJCOM, Air Component,
FOA, DRU, and Unit), the FAM should be the most highly knowledgeable and experienced person within
the functional area and have the widest range of visibility over the functional area readiness and capability
issues (AFI 36-2201).
Functional Manager (FM). An individual assigned collateral responsibility for training, classification,
utilization, and career development of personnel.
Global Combat Support System – Air Force (GCSS-AF). An enterprise infrastructure program
established to develop, integrate, and deploy combat support information capabilities. The mission of
GCSS-AF is to provide timely, accurate, and trusted Agile Combat Support (ACS) information to Joint and
Air Force commanders, their staffs, and ACS personnel at all ranks and echelons with the appropriate level
of security needed to execute the Air Force mission throughout the spectrum of military operations. GCSS-
AF is the means by which ACS functional systems will be modernized and integrated to improve business
processes supported on a single robust network-centric infrastructure. In addition to integrating combat
support applications, GCSS-AF also provides core enterprise services such as a common user
presentation through the AF Portal, Enterprise Information Management (Workflow, Records Management,
Document Management, Knowledge Management, and Collaboration), and an enterprise data warehouse.
Global Command and Control System (GCCS). An automated information system designed to support
deliberate and crisis planning with the use of an integrated set of analytic tools and flexible data transfer
capabilities. GCCS will become the single C4I system to support the warfighter from foxhole to command
post.
Global Information Grid (GIG). The globally interconnected, end-to-end set of information capabilities,
associated processes, and personnel for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating and managing
information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. The GIG includes all owned
and leased communications and computing systems and services, software (including applications), data,
security services, and other associated services necessary to achieve Information Superiority. The GIG
supports all Department of Defense, National Security, and related Intelligence community missions and
functions (strategic, operational, tactical, and business), in war and in peace. The GIG provides
capabilities from all operating locations (bases, posts, camps, stations, facilities, mobile platforms, and
deployed sites). The GIG provides interfaces to coalition, allied, and non-DOD users and systems.
Go/No-Go. The “Go” is the stage at which a trainee has gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience
to perform the tasks without supervision; meets the task standard. “No-Go” is the stage at which the
trainee has not gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience to perform task without supervision; does
not meet task standard.
Individual Training Plan (ITP). Use AF Form 623, On-the-Job Training Record/AF Form 623B, or other
approved records system (e.g., Training Business Area (TBA)). The AF Form 623 reflects past and current
qualifications and is used to determine training requirements. It is intended to be a complete history of past
training and current qualifications. Supervisors will ensure all documentation is accurate and
comprehensive.
Information Life Cycle. Typically characterized as creation or collection, processing, dissemination, use,
storage, protection, and disposition. (DoDD 8000.1, Management of the Department of Defense
Information Enterprise).
Information Management (IM). The planning, budgeting, manipulating, and controlling of information
throughout its life cycle. Joint Publication 3-0 further defines IM as the function of managing an
organization’s information resources by the handling of knowledge acquired by one or many different
individuals and organizations in a way that optimizes access by all who have a share in that knowledge or a
right to that knowledge.




                                                      5

mandatory upgrade training to qualified officers. (AFI 36-2201).
Instructional System Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly (but flexible) process for planning,
developing, implementing, and managing instructional systems. It ensures personnel are taught in a cost
efficient way to become educated on the knowledge, skills, and abilities essential for successful job
performance.
Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). JTRS will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the
warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and
implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology, multiple radio types (e.g.,
handheld, ground-mobile, airborne, maritime, etc.) are now allowed to communicate with one another. The
ultimate goal is to produce a family of interoperable, modular, software-defined radios that operate as
nodes in a network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for mobile and fixed
forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies, joint and coalition partners, and, in time, disaster response
personnel.
Knowledge Based Operations (KBO). KBO is the Air Force approach for managing information and
intellectual capital assets, such as people, processes and tools. Having timely, accurate, and relevant
information is critical to build the Air Force’s information superiority.
Knowledge Management (KM). The handling, directing, governing, or controlling of natural knowledge
processes (acquire/validate, produce, transfer/integrate knowledge) within an organization in order to
achieve the goals and objectives of the organization. KM seeks to make the best use of the knowledge
available to an organization, creating new knowledge, and increasing awareness and understanding in the
process. KM can also be defined as the capturing, organizing, and storing of knowledge and experiences
of individual workers and groups within an organization and making this information available to others in
the organization. (AFPD 33-3)
Knowledge Training. Training used to provide a base of knowledge for task performance. It may also be
used in lieu of task performance when the training capability does not exist. Learning gained through
knowledge rather than hands-on experience (AFI 36-2201).
Major Command (MAJCOM). A MAJCOM represents a major Air Force subdivision having a specific
portion of the Air Force mission. Each MAJCOM is directly subordinate to HQ USAF. MAJCOMs are
interrelated and complementary, providing offensive, defensive, and support elements.
Master Task Listing (MTL). A comprehensive list (100%) of all tasks performed within a work center and
consisting of the current CFETP or AFJQS and locally developed AF Forms 797 (as a minimum). Should
include tasks required for deployment and/or UTC requirements.
Master Training Plan (MTP). Employs a strategy for ensuring the completion of all work center job
requirements by using an MTL, providing milestones for task/CDC completion and prioritizes
deployment/UTC tasks, home station training tasks, upgrade tasks, and qualification tasks.
Occupational Survey Report (OSR). A detailed report showing the results of an occupational survey of
tasks performed within a particular AFSC.
On-the-Job Training (OJT). Hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted to certify personnel in both
upgrade (skill level award) and job qualification (duty position certification) training.
Proficiency Training. Additional training, either in-residence, or exportable advanced training courses, or
on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum
required for upgrade.
Qualification Training. Hands-on, task performance based training designed to qualify airmen in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process and
is designed to provide skills training required to do the job.

to finalize any CFETP changes or enlisted classification directory descriptions.
Specialty Training Standard (STS). An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force specialty in
terms of tasks and knowledge that an airman in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on
the job. Also identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level within an enlisted AFS. It
further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to show which of the overall training
requirements for an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) are taught in formal schools and correspondence
courses.
Standard. An exact value, a physical entity, or an abstract concept established and defined by authority,
custom, or common consent to serve as a reference, model, or rule in measuring quantities or qualities,

and FOA functional managers. The TAG sets training goals and priorities, reviews training programs, and
evaluates emerging training technologies. The group meets, as required, to prioritize training product
development.
Training Business Area (TBA). A web-based training application that provides Air Force warfighters with
global, real-time visibility into qualifications, certifications, and training status of communications
professionals across the AF. TBA supports base, wing, and work center training management activities by
automating business processes and capabilities to eliminate paper-based practices. The system
centralizes management of training task data, provides user access to CFETPs/JQSs, and increases
security through a single AF Portal log on. TBA replaced the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)
as the automated training tool of choice for maintaining automated training for communication and
information personnel.
Training Capability. The capability of a training setting to provide training on specified requirements,
based on the availability of resources.

valid contingency requirement.
Upgrade Training. Training that leads to the award of a higher skill level.
Utilization and Training Pattern. A depiction of the training provided to, and the jobs performed by,
personnel throughout their tenure within a career field or AFS. There are two types of patterns: 1) Current
pattern, which is based on the training provided to incumbents and the jobs to which they have been and
are assigned; and 2) Alternate pattern, which considers proposed changes in manpower, personnel, and
training policies. This is an executive decision meeting following the Specialty Training Requirements
Team meeting.
Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW). A forum of the AFCFM, MAJCOM Functional Managers,
subject matter experts (SME), and AETC training personnel that determines career ladder training
requirements.
Wartime Tasks. Those tasks which must be taught when courses are accelerated during a wartime
environment. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a
streamlined training environment. These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied
to their schoolhouse tasks.
Workflow. A series of steps necessary for the initiation, tracking, and delivery of services or outputs with
the capability to cut across existing or future organizational boundaries. Furthermore, web-based workflow
products allow electronic coordination, staffing, and task management of documents and files. They are
relational to an electronic version of the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and other AF/DoD forms used for
routing/collection of information. Automation provides the capability to suspense and track correspondence
through the workflow process and provides action officers and document originators status on their
packages. Provides users the capabilities to comply with structured electronic workflow processes and the
flexibility to create/develop ad hoc workflow courses of actions. Future use of standardized EIM tools will
enhance usability and eliminate legacy methods.

Section A - General Information
1. Purpose of the CFETP. This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM
Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop,
manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the initial
skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training those individuals in AFSC 3D1X4 should
receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers. Initial skills training is the AFS specific
training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the
                                                   rd
3-skill level. This training is provided by the 333 Training Squadron (TRS) at Keesler AFB, MS.
Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development
Course (CDC) completion, and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It
is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is
formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-
residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to
increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several
purposes, some of which are:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training
program. Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's
career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training
medium.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training
program.

2. Use of the CFETP. The CFETP is maintained by the 3D1XX Air Force Career Field Manager
(AFCFM), SAF/A60D. MAJCOM FMs and AETC review the plan annually to ensure currency and
accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM. Using the list of courses in Part II, they
determine whether duplicate training exists and take steps to eliminate/prevent duplicate efforts. Career
field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training
program is available for each individual in the career ladder.
2.1. AETC training personnel develop/revise formal resident and exportable training based upon
requirements established by the users and documented in the STS. They also develop procurement and
acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training,
2.2. MAJCOM FMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP for mandatory initial skill and
upgrade requirements. They also identify the needed AFJQSs/AFQTPs to document unique upgrade and
continuation training requirements. Requirements are satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract
training, or exportable courseware/courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be
included in this plan.
       st
2.3. 81 TRSS/TSQ Qualification Training Flight (Q-Flight) personnel develop training packages
(AFJQSs/AFQTPs) based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities
assigned by the AFCFM.
2.4. Unit level training managers and supervisors manage and control progression through the career
field by ensuring individuals complete the mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified in this
plan and supplemented by their MAJCOM. The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference for
planning continuation or career enhancement training.
2.5. Submit recommended improvements/corrections to the 333rd TRS/TRR Training Manager.



                                                      9
3. Coordination and Approval of the CFETP. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements. The
AETC training manager initiates an annual review of this document by AETC and MAJCOM functional
managers to ensure the CFETP’s currency and accuracy by using the list of courses in Part II to eliminate
duplicate training.

 PART II

 Section A - Specialty Training Standard
 1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the 3-level class
 beginning 20100105.
 2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:
 2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge,
 and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.
 Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies by skill level, specialty-wide training requirements. NOTE: Core tasks
 are minimum task training requirements for upgrade.
 2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
 training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician
 qualifications, if available. For initial certification or transcribing documentation complete the columns in
 accordance with AFI 36-2201.
 2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to
 be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career
 knowledge provided by the correspondence course. See the Air University Catalog maintained at
 http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/ for current CDC listings.
 2.4. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level
 of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.
 2.5. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623,
 Individual Training Record folder and used according to AFI 36-2201,.
 2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
 (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement
 Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample
 knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate
 for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.
 Individual responsibilities are listed in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing
 System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.
 3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC
 training. A Training Feedback Hotline has been installed for the supervisors' convenience. For a quick
 response to concerns, call our Training Feedback Hotline at DSN 597-4566, fax us at DSN 597-3790, or
 e-mail us at 81trg-tget@keesler.af.mil. Reference this STS and identify the specific area of concern
 (paragraph, training standard element, etc).

NOTE 1: Dashed items in this CTS are not part of the original CTS created at the December 2007 IT
Fundamentals U&TW however, they are the specific objectives taught in the IT Fundamentals course
designed to meet the CTS requirements.
NOTE 2: Unless otherwise stated, students may be allowed two assists from the instructor and still
successfully achieve the proper level of proficiency. An instructor assist is anytime an instructor must
intercede to provide guidance to a student which leads to a satisfactory completion of the objective or to
prevent the student from continuing in a manner that will lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion, safety
violation, or damage to equipment.
NOTE 3: All 3-level tasks will be trained if a wartime surge is ordered.

                                                               Explanations
 *   A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
     task. (Example: b and 1b)
 ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or
    for a subject common to several tasks. This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is
    provided in the course or CDC.
 X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.
 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

*      A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
       task. (Example: b and 1b)
**     A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for
       a subject common to several tasks. This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in
       the course or CDC.
X      This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.
NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.
(-)    When this code is used in the Core Task Column it indicates that the qualification is a local determination.
(5) When this code is used in the Core Task Column it indicates the CFM has mandated this task as a core 5-level requirement. The
    training to satisfy this requirement is either provided through OJT, CBTs, CDCs, or a combination.
(7) When this code is used in the Core Task Column it indicates the CFM has mandated this task as a core 7-level requirement. The
    training to satisfy this requirement is either provided through OJT, CBTs, CDCs, or a combination.

Section B - Course Objective List
4. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge which is
measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a
performance progress check and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and
performance elements using a written test and a progress check.

5. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement
are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is
provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the
behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the
student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially
proficient). The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task.

7. Course Objectives. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Block of Instruction.
Because the communications career field is ever changing, we are providing a website with a "living"
course objective list (COL). As changes are made to the courses they will also be made to the website.
Use the following link to get started and then navigate to the COL by selecting the 81st TRW, 81st TRG
and finally the 333rd TRS to locate the COL.
