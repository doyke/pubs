1.22. Taxi and Towing Distances.
   1.22.1. Do not taxi or tow beyond taxiway hold lines, or within 100 feet of an active runway
   if there are no hold lines, unless previously cleared by air traffic control.
   1.22.2. Do not taxi or tow an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring the clearance between the aircraft and the obstruction.
       1.22.2.1. Locally based aircraft are exempt when fixed taxi routes are marked and the
       obstruction is permanent. See paragraph 1.22.2.1.3 for the definition of a permanent
       obstruction. This exemption only applies to locations where aircraft are taxiing into or out
       of a parking spot. These criteria shall not be applied on taxiways or taxi lanes where
       aircraft do not normally park. Taxi routes must be used by the same model aircraft for
       which they were designed.
           1.22.2.1.1. The exemption and waiver authorities specified in this instruction apply
           only to existing facilities. Do not apply these criteria in the design of new facilities.
           UFC 3-260-1 Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, establishes design criteria
           for new facility construction, including waivers to design criteria.
1.22.2.1.2. NOTE: MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no lower than WG/CC) may waive the
requirement for 25 feet clearance in taxi lanes only, but in no case can this be waived to less than
10 feet between wingtips and any portion of adjacent aircraft (also see paragraph 1.22.3.1.3).
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  15


When the waivered taxi lines require the aircraft to turn, the waiver can only be applied to
aircraft with good visibility of the wingtips from the cockpit that do not require the use of
judgmental oversteering for turns (ex. C-21 or most fighters).
           1.22.2.1.3. NOTE:        Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are
           considered a permanent obstruction for purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2 through 1.22.3,
           provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated by
           permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable
           means. AGE or vehicles parked in these areas must have a parking brake set, chocks,
           or another suitable means to prevent inadvertent movement of the equipment.
           Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is
           parked properly in it’s designated spot and is not moving.
           1.22.2.1.4. CAUTION: When designing and marking parking areas as described in
           paragraphs 1.22.2 and 1.22.3, MAJCOMs and units must take into account the effects
           of wing and tail growth, landing gear geometry, and use of judgmental over-steering
           during turns, as applicable, to insure clearances are maintained during all phases of a
           turn into or out of a parking spot.
           1.22.2.1.5. NOTE: For the purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2 and 1.22.3, locally based
           aircraft include aircraft of the same type operating at another base with the same type
           aircraft, in parking areas specifically designed for that type aircraft. For example, a
           KC-135 from Grand Forks AFB ND operating in the KC-135 parking area at
           McConnell AFB KS or an F-15 from RAF Lakenheath operating in the F-15 parking
           area at Seymour-Johnson AFB NC.
   1.22.3. Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 feet to any obstruction.
   1.22.3. (AMC) Large aircraft (C-5, C-17, KC-10, and KC-135) will not be turned while
   within 25 feet of any obstacle. Scanners (if required by the applicable flight publications),
   taxi signal personnel, and wing walkers will render a stop signal in lieu of a turn signal when
   in their judgment an immediate turn is required to provide the necessary 10-foot clearance.
   Any time the pilot doubts that adequate clearance exists, aircrew members, if applicable, will
   deplane to verify obstruction clearance. C-21 aircraft do not require a signal person at the
   wingtip if the marshaller is in a position at the nose of the aircraft which allows clear
   visibility of the wingtip and obstruction. When Air Force signal personnel are not otherwise
   available, the pilot will use crewmembers not required for taxi operations, including qualified
   maintenance personnel, as signal personnel. All crewmembers and maintenance personnel
   used as signal personnel will be thoroughly briefed on deplaning and signaling procedures.
   This paragraph applies only when aircraft have the capability to safely deplane crewmembers
   with engines running.
       1.22.3.1. This restriction can be waived by the MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no
       lower than WG/CC) under any of the following circumstances:
           1.22.3.1.1. During contingency operations when compliance would restrict the
           mission. A marshaller must be used.
           1.22.3.1.2. When operating from alert, readiness, or protective shelters. A plainly
           visible centerline must be painted along the exit path. A marshaller must be used.

         1.22.3.1.3. Locally based aircraft when operating into and out of parking spots
         specifically designed for those aircraft and the obstruction is permanent. These
         criteria shall not be applied on taxiways or taxi lanes where aircraft do not normally
         park, or when environmental or operational conditions (ice, snow, inoperative
         systems, etc.) may impact the normal turn performance of the aircraft. Taxi routes
         shall be clearly marked. Taxi routes must be used by the same model aircraft for
         which they were designed. See paragraph 1.22.2.1.3 for the definition of a permanent
         obstruction. Parking spots shall be spaced to allow a minimum of 10 feet clearance
         between any portion of adjacent aircraft. A marshaller must be used.
             1.22.3.1.3.1. WARNING: Paragraph 1.22.3 sets out minimum clearances for
             aircraft taxiing into and out of parking spots. These minimums may not be
             appropriate for all types of aircraft, especially large swept wing aircraft with
             limited visibility from the cockpit and/or when judgmental over-steering may be
             required for turning (i.e. C-5, KC-10, KC-135, etc.). When turns are required,
             MAJCOMs will establish appropriate clearance standards for aircraft where
             visibility is limited from the cockpit, judgmental over-steering is required for
             turning, or there is wing or tail growth during turns.

       1.22.3.2. Operating from alert, readiness, or protective shelters. A plainly visible
       centerline must be painted along the exit path. A marshaller must be used.
       1.22.3.3. Operating locally based aircraft from parking spots specifically designed for
       those aircraft. Parking spots shall be spaced to allow a minimum 10‖ clearance between
       any portion of adjacent aircraft and will have clearly marked taxi routes. Support
       equipment required for each spot shall be placed in appropriately designated and marked
       areas. A marshaller must be used.
       1.22.3.4. These clearance criteria can only be assured at US Air Force installations.
   1.22.4. (Added-AMC) When turning a swept wing aircraft, the outside wing and tail may
   grow anywhere from 3 to 24 feet (at speeds upwards of 25 knots). Refer to applicable flight
   manual and AFTTP 3-3 for MDS specific guidance on blind spots, turn radii, wing/tail
   velocities and wing/tail growth.
       1.22.4.1. (Added-AMC) Wing and Tail growth occurs during a turn when the wing
       tip/tail describes an arc greater than the normal wingspan due to the geometry of the
       aircraft and the arrangement of the landing gear. Although the effect is less noticeable at
       moderate curvature of turn, it still serves to erode the perceived wing tip/tail clearance in
       any turn.
       1.22.4.2. (Added-AMC) When feasible, always use the largest turn radius possible and
       remember the wingtips and the horizontal stabilizer move in larger arcs than the aircraft’s
       nose, so monitor these areas of the aircraft carefully for clearance with structures,
       equipment and other aircraft.
1.23. (Added-AMC) Rules for Personnel Engaged in Towing Operations. If doubt exists as
to the qualification of tow team personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to tow
aircraft until qualified personnel can be located. When primary crewmembers are required to
occupy cockpit positions during towing operations by non-AMC personnel at non-AMC Air
Force installations, the aircraft commander will coordinate with the senior maintenance officer or
superintendent to ensure the towing supervisor and crew are fully qualified in accordance with
AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line-Ground Operations And Activities. At non-Air Force
installations, the aircraft commander must have approval from the airfield operations officer or
manager prior to towing. EXCEPTION: Not applicable to PACAF and contractor-maintained
aircraft.

1.24. (Added-AMC) Aircraft Recovery. Aircrews will not attempt to recover an AMC
aircraft from unprepared surface areas that have been entered inadvertently. Normally, aircraft
recovery will be accomplished by ground crews using appropriate equipment. Recovery may be
accomplished by aircrews when it can be determined that the unprepared surface will support the
aircraft; MAJOCOM/A3V is approval authority to recover an aircraft from an unprepared
surface.

Section 2A—Standard Marshalling Signals For The Air Force

2.1. Standard Marshalling Signals. For standard marshalling signals for the Air Force, see
Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. All ground and aircrew personnel must use these signals to direct and
control movement and operation of aircraft on the ground. Refer to Chapter 1 for testing
requirements.
2.2. AF Visual Aid (AFVA) 11-224, Aircraft Marshalling Signals. AFVA 11-224 shows
marshalling signals identical to those in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. Display this visual aid where
maintenance and flight related operations take place. Suitable locations are aircraft maintenance
work areas and flight line buildings frequented by ground and aircrew personnel.

Section 2B—Aircraft Marshallers.

2.3. Aircraft Marshallers. Aircraft marshallers provide hand signals to personnel taxiing or
operating aircraft on the ground.
   2.3.1. Transient alert aircraft marshallers will wear the uniform described in paragraph
   2.3.1.1. Uniform consistency is necessary to ensure flying personnel of one nation can
   readily identify aircraft marshallers of other nations. Individuals directly involved in fueling,
   defueling, and servicing liquid oxygen systems shall not wear the marshaller’s uniform.
   Concurrent Servicing Supervisors are exempted.
       2.3.1.1. The uniform is a sleeveless garment of fluorescent international orange. It covers
       the shoulders and extends to the waist in the front and back. Wear this garment over the
       basic uniform prescribed for transient alert personnel.
       2.3.1.2. The orange garment may be marked with numbers on the front and back, at the
       discretion of the installation commander,
       2.3.1.3. During daylight hours, marshallers may use high visibility paddles. Self-
       illuminating wands are required at night or during restricted visibility.
       2.3.1.3. (AMC) . AMC marshallers may use either high visibility paddles or high
       visibility marshalling sticks/wands during daylight hours.

Section 2C—Visual Marshalling Signals

2.4. USAF Visual Marshalling Signals (Pilot Initiated):
   2.4.1. Pilots will initiate all signals regarding the operation of aircraft systems, for example,
   speed brakes, flaps, etc. The marshaller (crew chief) will repeat the given signal when it is
   safe to operate the aircraft system.
   2.4.2. When marshallers must stay with a moving aircraft, pilots must make sure taxi speeds
   allow the ground marshaller or signal person to keep their proper position.
 20                                                     AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   2.4.3. When giving visual signals, the pilot’s hands must be in clear view of the marshaller.
   Specific signals are:
       2.4.3.1. ―OK.‖ Thumbs up.
       2.4.3.2. Trim Set for Take Off. Pilot forms ―T‖ with hands.
       2.4.3.3. Safety Pin check. Comply with technical order procedures. If the technical order
       does not specify safety pin check procedures, then the pilot must display seat pin before
       requesting removal of chocks. Marshallers must display ground safety pins before
       stowage.
       2.4.3.4. Armament Switches Off, Safe, or Normal Position. This signal is used during
       arming and de-arming aircraft. The pilot must verify that all armament switches are
       turned off and then place hands in clear view of the ground crew.
       2.4.3.5. Pitot Heat Check. The pilot grasps extended forefinger of left hand with right
       hand. The marshaller will give ―OK‖ signal if the system is operating properly.
       2.4.3.6. Nose Gear Steering Check. The pilot, with hands at head level, palms toward
       marshaller, moves hands back and forth simulating movement of rudder pedals. After
       positive acknowledgment from marshaller, the pilot performs the steering check. The
       marshaller will give the ―OK‖ signal if nose gear moves properly.
       2.4.3.7. Probe Check. The pilot raises arm upward and in a position resembling a probe.
       The marshaller will give the ―OK‖ signal if no malfunction is observed.
       2.4.3.8. Clearance to Release Drag Chute. The pilot extends arm outward and down;
       alternately clenches and opens hand. The marshaller will:
          2.4.3.8.1. Respond with an affirmative nod if all is clear to release chute, and
          2.4.3.8.2. Give the ―OK‖ signal when drag chute separates from aircraft.
       2.4.3.9. Clear to Lower Canopy. The pilot pats top of helmet; the marshaller pats top of
       head.
       2.4.3.10. Flight Refueling Door Check. The pilot places hand on top of helmet with palm
       down and fingers forward, then raises and lowers forward portion of hand to simulate
       door opening and closing. The marshaller repeats the signal to indicate clear for safe
       opening or closing; then gives an ―OK‖ signal if operation is proper.
       2.4.3.11. Pilots may use other signals, similar to marshaller’s signals in Figure 2.1 and
       Figure 2.2, as necessary.
          2.4.3.11.1. CAUTION: Do not extend arms or hands outside the cockpit on aircraft
          configured with clamshell-type canopies unless an uplock device has been inserted.
2.5. International Aircraft Marshalling Signals.
   2.5.1. Where possible, signals in this instruction comply with North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement 3117, Air Standardization Coordinating
   Committee Air Standard 44/42A, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) signals. Where there is a conflict in guidance
   between USAF, FAA, ICAO, and NATO documents, the USAF generally follows ICAO
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 21


   guidance wherever feasible. Significant differences in signals are annotated wherever
   possible.
   2.5.2. The marshaller will signal facing the aircraft while standing in one of the following
   positions:
       2.5.2.1. Fixed Wing Aircraft. The marshaller will stand forward of the left wingtip of the
       aircraft and remain in full view of the pilot.
       2.5.2.2. Helicopters. The marshaller will stand in full view of the pilot (the pilot is
       usually on the right side of the helicopter).
   2.5.3. During night operations or restricted visibility, the marshaller will use a pair of same
   color light wands. During surface taxiing or parking, the pilot must stop immediately if one
   or both of the marshaller’s wands fail.

                        AIRPORT MARKINGS, LIGHTS AND SIGNS

Section 3A—Standard Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs.

3.1. Standard Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs. All ground and aircrew personnel
involved with moving aircraft on the ground must be familiar with airport markings, lights and
signs. This is to direct and control movement and operation of aircraft on the ground and reduce
runway incursions. Refer to Chapter 1 for testing requirements.
3.2. Visual Aid for Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs.
   3.2.1. FAA Form 5280-7 shows selected FAA airport markings and signs identical to those
   in Section 3C, Section 3D, and Section 3E. For units based at civilian or joint use airports,
   display this visual aid where maintenance and flight related operations take place. Suitable
   locations are aircraft maintenance work areas and flight line buildings frequented by ground
   and aircrew personnel. This visual aid is available free from the FAA via Error! Hyperlink
   reference not valid.. Select the button ―Runway Safety Awareness Materials‖. Select
   ―Ground Vehicle Guide Placard‖.
   3.2.2. AFVA 11-240 shows selected USAF airport markings and signs identical to those in
   Section 3C, Section 3D, and Section 3E. For units based at USAF installations, display this
   visual aid where maintenance and flight related operations take place. Suitable locations are
   aircraft maintenance work areas and flight line buildings frequented by ground and aircrew
   personnel. This includes vehicles operated on USAF airfields. Reference AFI 13-213,
   Airfield Management, for further flight line driving information.
   3.2.3. Units located at contingency or foreign airfields use the visual aid (FAA or USAF)
   that most clearly depicts the actual markings at the airfield.
3.3. Compliance With Airport Markings, Lights, and Signs. Where possible, airport
markings, lights, and signs shown in this instruction are taken from applicable ICAO NATO, and
FAA airport markings, lights, and signs documents. Not all airfields will have all forms of
markings, lights, and signs described in this chapter. Certain older airfields may be ―grand
fathered‖ under obsolete standards. Additional variations may be required due to unique terrain,
or obstacles. Foreign airfields may not comply with ICAO Standards and Recommended
Practices (SARPS). Installation of a particular system is dependent on airfield design, airfield
jurisdiction, age of the airfield, predominant use, geographic location, and other operational
factors. Flight Information Publications (FLIP) and local directives detail configurations for each
particular airfield. Personnel must be familiar with the specific airport markings, lights, and signs
at a particular airfield prior to operating an aircraft on that airfield. In case of conflict between
ICAO, NATO, FAA, and USAF documents, USAF requirements take precedence at USAF
airfields. Significant differences are annotated to the maximum extent feasible.

Section 3B—Airport Markings

3.4. General.
   3.4.1. For the purpose of this regulation the Airport Pavement Markings have been grouped
   into four areas:
      3.4.1.1. Runway Markings.
      3.4.1.2. Taxiway Markings.
      3.4.1.3. Holding Position Markings.
      3.4.1.4. Other Markings.
   3.4.2. Marking Colors. Most runway markings are white. Arresting System Warning
   Markings are yellow. USAF and some ICAO arrowheads and chevrons in displaced
   threshold areas are yellow. Markings defining the landing area on a heliport are also white,
   except for hospital heliports that use a red ―H‖ on a white cross. Markings for taxiways, areas
   not intended for use by aircraft (closed and hazardous areas), and holding positions (even if
   they are on a runway) are usually yellow.
3.5. Runway Markings.
   3.5.1. Runway Designators. Runway numbers and letters are determined from the approach
   direction. The runway number is the whole number nearest one-tenth the magnetic azimuth
   of the centerline of the runway, measured clockwise from the magnetic north. The letters,
   differentiate between left (L), right (R), or center (C), parallel runways, as applicable:
      3.5.1.1. For two parallel runways ―L‖ ―R.‖
      3.5.1.2. For three parallel runways ―L‖ ―C‖ ―R.‖
   3.5.2. Runway Centerline Marking. The runway centerline identifies the center of the
   runway and consists of a line of uniformly spaced stripes and gaps.
   3.5.3. Runway Side Stripe Marking. Runway side stripes delineate the edges of the runway
   to enhance visual acquisition of the runway environment during transition from instrument to
   visual flight. Side stripes consist of continuous white stripes located on each side of the
   runway.
   3.5.4. Runway Shoulder Markings. Runway shoulder stripes may be used to supplement
   runway side stripes to identify pavement areas contiguous to the runway sides that are not
   intended for use by aircraft. Runway Shoulder stripes are yellow.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  53


Figure 3.1. Runway Shoulder Markings.




   3.5.5. Threshold Bar. FAA Only. A threshold bar delineates the beginning of the runway that
   is available for landing when there is pavement aligned with the runway on the approach side
   of the threshold. The threshold bar is 10 feet wide and is white since it is part of the useable
   runway surface.
   3.5.6. Demarcation Bar. A demarcation bar delineates a runway with a displaced threshold
   from a blast pad, under run, stopway (overrun) or taxiway that precedes the runway.
      3.5.6.1. FAA Only. The demarcation bar is three feet wide and is located on the blast
      pad, stopway or taxiway at the point of intersection with the runway. It is yellow to
      indicate it is not part of the useable runway, except when the area preceding the threshold
      can be used for takeoff, then the demarcation bar will be white.
      3.5.6.2. USAF/ICAO Only. Neither USAF nor ICAO require a demarcation bar for
      contiguous blast pads or overruns. The demarcation bar is only required where
      operational pavement is located on the approach side of the threshold marking, such as
      with a displaced threshold or contiguous taxiway. In those cases, the bar is four feet wide
      and is white because it is located on the runway surface.
   3.5.7. Threshold Markings. These markings are used to show pavement areas aligned with
   the runway that are unusable for landing, takeoff, and/or taxiing.
      3.5.7.1. General Information.
          3.5.7.1.1. Arrowheads highlight the beginning of the useable landing surface.
          3.5.7.1.2. Taxiway markings in a displaced threshold area indicate an area suitable
          for taxi only.
          3.5.7.1.3. Arrows in a displaced threshold area indicate an area suitable for taxi and
          takeoff only.
          3.5.7.1.4. Chevrons in a displaced threshold area indicate an area unsuitable for taxi,
          takeoff, or landing.

     3.5.7.2. Arrows and Arrowheads.
        3.5.7.2.1. FAA Only. Arrows and arrowheads used in a displaced threshold area are
        white since the area is useable for takeoff. Arrowheads used on a taxiway prior to a
        runway threshold are yellow since the area is not useable for takeoff or landing.
        3.5.7.2.2. USAF Only. In permanently displaced thresholds all arrows and
        arrowheads are yellow. The shaft of the arrow will be white. In temporarily displaced
        thresholds the arrowheads could be white or yellow.
        3.5.7.2.3. ICAO Only. Arrows and arrowheads used in a displaced threshold area
        may be white or yellow regardless of whether the displaced threshold area is suitable
        for takeoff.
     3.5.7.3. Chevrons
        3.5.7.3.1. Chevrons are yellow since the area is unusable for taxi, takeoff, or landing.

3.6. Taxiway Markings.
   3.6.1. All taxiways should have centerline markings and runway holding position markings
   whenever they intersect a runway. Taxiway edge markings are present whenever there is a
   need to separate the taxiway from a pavement that is not intended for aircraft use or to
   delineate the edge of the taxiway. Taxiways may also have shoulder markings and holding
   position markings for Instrument Landing System/Microwave Landing System (ILS/MLS)
   critical areas, and taxiway/taxiway intersection markings.
NOTE: The USAF has no requirement to mark taxiway/taxiway intersections at USAF
installations.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 57


Figure 3.4. Taxiway Holding Position Markings.




   3.6.2. Taxiway Centerline. The taxiway centerline is a single continuous yellow line. This
   provides a visual cue to permit taxiing along a designated path. Ideally the aircraft should be
   kept centered over this line during taxi to ensure adequate clearance.
   3.6.3. Taxiway Edge Markings. Taxiway edge markings are used to define the edge of the
   taxiway. They are primarily used when the taxiway edge does not correspond with the edge
   of the pavement. There are two types of markings depending upon whether the aircraft is
   supposed to cross the taxiway edge:
      3.6.3.1. Continuous Markings. These consist of a continuous double yellow line. They
      are used to define the taxiway edge from the shoulder or some other abutting paved
      surface not intended for use by aircraft.
      3.6.3.2. Dashed Markings. These markings are used when there is an operational need to
      define the edge of a taxiway or taxi lane on a paved surface where the adjoining
      pavement to the taxiway edge is intended for use by aircraft. e.g., an apron. Dashed
      taxiway edge markings consist of a broken double yellow line.

Figure 3.5. Taxiway Edge Markings.




      3.6.3.3. Taxiway Shoulder Markings. Taxiways, holding bays, and aprons are sometimes
      provided with paved shoulders to prevent blast and water erosion. Although shoulders
      may have the appearance of full strength pavement they are not intended for use by
      aircraft, and may be unable to support an aircraft. Usually the taxiway edge marking will
      define this area. Where conditions exist such as islands or taxiway curves that may cause
      confusion as to which side of the edge stripe is for use by aircraft, taxiway shoulder
      markings may be used to indicate the pavement is unusable. Taxiway shoulder markings
      are yellow.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  59


Figure 3.6. Taxiway Shoulder Markings.




   3.6.4. Surface Painted Taxiway Direction Signs. Surface painted taxiway direction signs
   have a yellow background with a black inscription, and are provided when it is not possible
   to provide taxiway direction signs at intersections, or when necessary to supplement such
   signs. These markings are located adjacent to the centerline with signs indicating turns to the
   left being on the left side of the taxiway centerline and signs indicating turns to the right
   being on the right side of the centerline.
NOTE: At USAF installations, surface painted taxiway direction signs are yellow block letters
with no background.
   3.6.5. Surface Painted Location Signs. Surface painted location signs have a black
   background with a yellow inscription. When necessary, these markings are used to
   supplement location signs located along side the taxiway and assist the pilot in confirming
   the designation of the taxiway on which the aircraft is located. These markings are located on
   the right side of the centerline.
NOTE: At USAF installations, surface painted location signs are yellow block letters with no
background.

Figure 3.7. Surface Painted Location and Direction Signs.




At USAF installations, surface painted taxiway direction and location signs are yellow block
letters with no background.
   3.6.6. Geographic Position Markings. These markings are located at points along low
   visibility taxi routes designated in the airport’s Surface Movement Guidance Control System
   (SMGCS) plan. They are used to identify the location of taxiing aircraft during low visibility
   operations. Low visibility operations are those that occur when the runway visual range
   (RVR) is below 1200 feet. They are positioned to the left of the taxiway centerline in the
   direction of taxiing. The geographic position marking is a circle comprised of an outer black
   ring contiguous to a white ring with a pink circle in the middle. When installed on asphalt or
   other dark-colored pavements, the white ring and the black ring are reversed, i.e., the white
   ring becomes the outer ring and the black ring becomes the inner ring. It is designated with
   either a number or a number and letter. The number corresponds to the consecutive position
   of the marking on the route.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 61


Figure 3.8. Geographic Position Markings.




3.7. Holding Position Markings.
   3.7.1. Runway Holding Position Markings. For runways these markings indicate where an
   aircraft is supposed to stop. For the FAA, they consist of four yellow lines, two solid and two
   dashed, extending across the width of the taxiway or runway. For the USAF, they may only
   consist of two yellow lines, one solid and one dashed, extending across the width of the
   runway or taxiway. The solid lines are always on the side where the aircraft is to hold. There
   are three locations where runway holding position markings are encountered.
CAUTION: The USAF Runway Holding Position Marking shown below is the same as the
FAA marking for a Non-movement Area Boundary. Personnel must be cognizant of this
difference to avoid a runway incursion.
 62                                                    AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


Figure 3.9. Runway Holding Position Markings.




      3.7.1.1. Taxiways. These markings identify the locations on a taxiway where an aircraft
      is supposed to stop when it does not have clearance to proceed onto the runway. The
      runway holding position markings are shown. When instructed by ATC ―Hold short of
      (runway ―xx‖)‖ the aircrew or ground crew should stop so no part of the aircraft extends
      beyond the holding position marking. When approaching the holding position marking,
      an aircrew or ground crew person should not cross the marking without ATC clearance at
      a controlled airport or without making sure of adequate separation from other aircraft at
      uncontrolled airports. An aircraft exiting a runway is not clear of the runway until all
      parts of the aircraft have crossed the applicable holding position marking.
      3.7.1.2. Runways. These markings are installed on runways only if the runway is
      normally used by air traffic control for ―land, hold short‖ operations or taxiing operations
      and have operational significance only for those two types of operations. A sign with a
      white inscription on a red background is installed adjacent to these holding position
      markings. The holding position markings are placed on runways prior to the intersection
      with another runway, or some designated point.
      3.7.1.3. Runway Approach Areas. These markings are used at some airports where it is
      necessary to hold an aircraft on a taxiway located in the approach or departure area of a
      runway so that the aircraft does not interfere with the operations on that runway. This
      marking is collocated with the runway approach area holding position sign.
   3.7.2. Holding Position Markings for ILS. Holding position markings for ILS/MLS critical
   areas consist of two yellow solid lines spaced two feet apart connected by pairs of solid lines
   extending across the width of the taxiway as shown. A sign with an inscription in white on a
   red background is installed adjacent to these hold position markings. When the ILS critical
   area is being protected, the aircrew or ground crew should stop so no part of the aircraft
   extends beyond the holding position marking. When approaching the holding position
   marking, an aircrew or ground crew person should not cross the marking without ATC
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                               63


   clearance. ILS critical area is not clear until all parts of the aircraft have crossed the
   applicable holding position marking.
NOTE: At USAF bases, additional markings will be present at the holding position. The letters
―INST‖ are painted symmetrically about the centerline of the taxiway just beyond the instrument
hold line so they can be read by an aircraft operator facing the runway.

Figure 3.10. Holding Position Markings for ILS Critical Area.




   3.7.3. Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway Intersections. Holding position
   markings for taxiway/taxiway intersections consist of a single dashed line extending across
   the width of the taxiway. They are installed on taxiways where air traffic control normally
   holds aircraft short of a taxiway intersection. When instructed by ATC ―hold short of
   (taxiway)‖ the aircrew or ground crew should stop so no part of the aircraft extends beyond
   the holding position marking. When the marking is not present the aircrew or ground crew
   should stop the aircraft at a point that provides adequate clearance from an aircraft on the
   intersecting taxiway.
NOTE: The USAF has no requirement to mark taxiway/taxiway intersections at USAF
installations.
 64                                                      AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


Figure 3.11. Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway Intersections.




   3.7.4. Surface Painted Holding Position Signs. Surface painted holding position signs have a
   red background with a white inscription and supplement the signs located at the holding
   position. This type of marking is normally used where the width of the holding position on
   the taxiway is greater than 200 feet. It is located to the left side of the taxiway centerline on
   the holding side and prior to the holding position marking.

Figure 3.12. Surface Painted Holding Position Sign.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                65


3.8. Other Markings.
   3.8.1. Vehicle Roadway Markings. The vehicle roadway markings are used when necessary
   to define a pathway for vehicle operations on or crossing areas that are also intended for
   aircraft. These markings consist of a single or double white solid line to delineate each edge
   of the roadway and dashed or solid yellow or white lines to separate lanes within the edges of
   the roadway. In lieu of the solid lines, zipper markings may be used to delineate the edges of
   the vehicle roadway.

Figure 3.13. Vehicle Roadway Markings.




   3.8.2. Non-movement Area Boundary Markings. These markings delineate the movement
   area, i.e., area under air traffic control. These markings are yellow and located on the
   boundary between the movement and non-movement area. The non-movement area
   boundary markings consist of two yellow lines, one solid and one dashed. The solid line is
   located on the non-movement area side while the dashed yellow line is located on the
   movement area side.
NOTE: There is no requirement for non-movement area boundary markings at USAF
installations.
CAUTION: The USAF Runway Holding Position Marking is the same as the FAA marking for
a Non-movement Area Boundary shown below. Personnel must be cognizant of this difference to
avoid a runway incursion.
 66                                                    AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


Figure 3.14. Non-movement Area Boundary Markings.




   3.8.3. Marking and Lighting of Permanently Closed Runways and Taxiways. For runways
   and taxiways that are permanently closed, the lighting circuits will be disconnected. The
   runway threshold, runway designation, and touchdown markings are obliterated and yellow
   X’s are placed at each end of the runway and at 1,000-foot intervals.

Figure 3.15. Closed Runway or Taxiway Markings.




   3.8.4. Temporarily Closed Runways and Taxiways. To provide a visual indication to pilots
   that a runway is temporarily closed; X’s are placed on the runway only at each end of the
   runway. The X’s are yellow in color.
      3.8.4.1. A raised lighted yellow X may be placed on each runway end in lieu of the
      markings described to indicate the runway is closed.
      3.8.4.2. A visual indication may not be present depending on the reason for the closure,
      duration of the closure, airfield configuration and the existence and the hours of operation
      of an airport traffic control tower. Pilots should check NOTAM’s and the Automated
      Terminal Information System (ATIS) for local runway and taxiway closure information.
      3.8.4.3. Temporarily closed taxiways are usually treated as hazardous areas, in which no
      part of an aircraft may enter, and are blocked with barricades. However, as an alternative
      a yellow X may be installed at each entrance to the taxiway.
   3.8.5. Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopter landing areas can be depicted in one of three
   ways, as shown below. The letter ―H‖ in the markings is oriented to align with the intended
   direction of approach.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 67

Section 3C—Airport Lighting Systems

3.9. Runway Lights
   3.9.1. Runway Edge Lights. Runway edge lights are used to outline the edges of runways
   during periods of darkness or restricted visibility. The runway edge lights are white, except
   on instrument runways yellow (or amber) replaces white on the last 2,000 feet or half the
   runway length, whichever is less, to form a caution zone for landings.
   3.9.2. Runway End Lights. Runway end lights define the end of the operational runway
   surface for aircraft for landing, roll out, or takeoff. They consist of red lights located
   symmetrically about, and perpendicular to, the runway centerline. They are located within 10
   feet of the end of the usable landing surface.
   3.9.3. Runway Threshold Lights. Runway threshold lights define the beginning of the
   operational runway surface for aircraft for landing. The lights emit red light toward the
   runway to indicate the runway end to a departing aircraft and may emit green outward from
   the runway end to indicate the threshold to landing aircraft.
   3.9.4. Runway Centerline Lighting System. Runway centerline lights are installed on some
   precision instrument runways. They are located along the runway centerline and are spaced at
   50-foot intervals. When viewed from the landing threshold, the runway centerline lights are
   white until the last 3,000 feet of the runway. The white lights begin to alternate with red for
   the next 2,000 feet, and for the last 1,000 feet of the runway, all centerline lights are red.
   3.9.5. Touchdown Zone Lights. Touchdown zone lights are installed on some precision
   approach runways. They consist of two rows of transverse light bars disposed symmetrically
   about the runway centerline. The system consists of steady-burning white lights that start 100
   feet beyond the landing threshold and extend to 3,000 feet beyond the landing threshold or to
   the midpoint of the runway, whichever is less.
 68                                                      AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   3.9.6. Stopway Lights (ICAO ONLY). Stopway lights are installed in stopways intended for
   use at night. They are placed in rows as an extension of the line of runway edge lights, with
   an additional line perpendicular to the runway centerline at the end of the stopway. Stopway
   lights are red.
   3.9.7. Taxiway Lead-Off Lights. (FAA and ICAO ONLY). Taxiway lead-off lights extend
   from the runway centerline to a point on an exit taxiway to expedite movement of aircraft
   from the runway. These lights alternate green and yellow (or amber) from the runway
   centerline to the runway holding position or the ILS/MLS critical area, as appropriate.
   3.9.8. Runway Exit Lights. (USAF ONLY). Runway exit lights serve the same function as
   taxiway lead-off lights. At USAF airfields these lights are green.
   3.9.9. Land and Hold Short Lights. Land and hold short lights are used to indicate the hold
   short point on certain runways that are approved for Land and Hold Short Operations
   (LAHSO). Land and hold short lights consist of a row of pulsing white lights installed across
   the runway at the hold short point. Where installed, the lights will be on anytime LAHSO is
   in effect. These lights will be off when LAHSO is not in effect.
3.10. Control of Lighting Systems.
   3.10.1. Operation of approach light systems and runway lighting is controlled by the control
   tower (ATCT). At some locations the Flight Service Station (FSS) may control the lights
   where there is no control tower in operation.
   3.10.2. Pilot’s radio control of lighting is available at selected airports to provide control of
   lights by keying the aircraft’s microphone. Control of lighting systems is often available at
   locations without specified hours for lighting and where there is no control tower or FSS or
   when the tower or FSS is closed (locations with a part-time tower or FSS) or specified hours.
   All lighting systems that are radio controlled at an airport, whether on a single runway or
   multiple runways, operate on the same radio frequency. USAF personnel should not adjust
   the intensity of lights, unless preparing to take off or land, to preclude producing a setting
   undesirable for a pilot attempting to take off or land.
3.11. Taxiway Lights
   3.11.1. FAA
      3.11.1.1. Taxiway Edge Lights. Taxiway edge lights are used to outline the edges of
      taxiways during periods of darkness or restricted visibility. These fixtures emit blue light.
      3.11.1.2. Taxiway Centerline Lights. Taxiway centerline lights are located along the
      taxiway centerline in a straight line on straight portions, on the centerline of curved
      portions, and along designated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron
      areas. Taxiway centerline lights are steady burning and emit green light.
      3.11.1.3. Clearance Bar Lights. Clearance bar lights are installed at holding positions on
      taxiways in order to increase the conspicuity of the holding position in low visibility
      conditions. They may also be installed to indicate the location of an intersecting taxiway
      during periods of darkness. Clearance bars consist of three in-pavement steady-burning
      yellow (or amber) lights.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 69


Figure 3.17. Clearance Bar Lights.




      3.11.1.4. Runway Guard Lights. Runway guard lights are installed at taxiway/runway
      intersections. They are primarily used to enhance the conspicuity of taxiway/runway
      intersections during low visibility conditions, but may be used in all weather conditions.
      Runway guard lights consist of either a pair of elevated flashing yellow (or amber) lights
      installed on either side of the taxiway, or a row of in-pavement yellow (or amber) lights
      installed across the entire taxiway, at the runway holding position marking.

Figure 3.18. Runway Guard Lights.




          3.11.1.4.1. Some airports may have a row of three or five in-pavement yellow (or
          amber) lights installed at taxiway/runway intersections. They should not be confused
          with clearance bar lights described in paragraph 3.11.1.3 Clearance Bar Lights.
      3.11.1.5. Stop Bar Lights. Stop bar lights, when installed, are used to confirm the ATC
      clearance to enter or cross the active runway in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft
      RVR). A stop bar consists of a row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement
      lights installed across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position, and elevated
      steady-burning red lights on each side. A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunction
      with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights that extend from the stop bar toward the
      runway. Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar is turned off and the lead-
      on lights are turned on. The stop bar and lead-on lights are automatically reset by a sensor
      or backup timer.
          3.11.1.5.1. Aircrews and ground crews should never cross a red illuminated stop bar,
          even if an ATC clearance has been given to proceed onto or across the runway.
          3.11.1.5.2. If after crossing a stop bar, the taxiway centerline lead-on lights
          inadvertently extinguish, aircrews and ground crews should hold their position and
          contact ATC for further instructions.

   3.11.2. USAF
      3.11.2.1. Taxiway Edge Lights. Taxiway edge lights are used to outline the edges of
      taxiways during periods of darkness or restricted visibility. These fixtures emit blue light.
      3.11.2.2. Taxiway Centerline Lights. Taxiway centerline lights are located along the
      taxiway centerline in a straight line on straight portions, on the centerline of curved
      portions, and along designated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron
      areas. Taxiway centerline lights are steady burning and emit green light. Where there are
      intersecting taxiways, the lights will be yellow (or amber). When installed in conjunction
      with a holding position, they will be yellow (or amber) facing the holding aircraft.
      Taxiway centerline lights may be installed in lieu of taxiway edge lights.
      3.11.2.3. Taxiway Hold Lights/Stop Bar. Taxiway hold lights are installed at hold
      positions where there is a need to enhance identification. They consist of 3 yellow (or
      amber) lights perpendicular to taxiway centerline (5 lights will be installed if the taxiway
      is unusually wide).
      3.11.2.4. Hold Position Edge Lights (Wig-Wag or Runway Guard Lights). Hold position
      edge lights are installed at taxiway/runway intersections and other areas where hold
      markings, signs, and clearance markings have not been fully effective, or in areas where
      other lights might cause distraction. They consist of a pair of elevated flashing yellow (or
      amber) lights installed on either side of the taxiway.
   3.11.3. ICAO
      3.11.3.1. Taxiway Edge Lights. Taxiway edge lights are used to outline the edges of
      taxiways during periods of darkness or restricted visibility conditions. These fixtures emit
      blue light.
      3.11.3.2. Taxiway Centerline Lights. Taxiway centerline lights are located along the
      taxiway centerline in a straight line on straight portions, on the centerline of curved
      portions, and along designated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron
      areas. Taxiway centerline lights are steady burning and emit green light.
      3.11.3.3. Runway Guard Lights. Runway guard lights are installed at taxiway/runway
      intersections. They are primarily used to enhance the conspicuity of taxiway/runway
      intersections during low visibility conditions, but may be used in all weather conditions.
      Runway guard lights consist of either a pair of elevated flashing yellow (or amber) lights
      installed on either side of the taxiway, or a row of in-pavement yellow (or amber) lights
      installed across the entire taxiway, at the runway holding position marking.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  71


Figure 3.20. Runway Guard Lights.




       3.11.3.4. Stop Bar Lights. Stop bar lights, when installed, are used to confirm the ATC
       clearance to enter or cross the active runway in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft
       RVR). A stop bar consists of a row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement
       lights installed across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position, and elevated
       steady-burning red lights on each side. A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunction
       with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights that extend from the stop bar toward the
       runway. Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar is turned off and the lead-
       on lights are turned on. The stop bar and lead-on lights are automatically reset by a sensor
       or backup timer.
           3.11.3.4.1. Aircrews and ground crews should never cross a red illuminated stop bar,
           even if an ATC clearance has been given to proceed onto or across the runway.
           3.11.3.4.2. If after crossing a stop bar, the taxiway centerline lead-on lights
           inadvertently extinguish, aircrews and ground crews should hold their position and
           contact ATC for further instructions.

Figure 3.21. Stop Bar Lights.




Section 3D—Airport Signs

3.12. General. There are six types of signs installed on airfields: mandatory instruction signs,
location signs, direction signs, destination signs, information signs, and runway distance
remaining signs.
3.13. Mandatory Instruction Signs.
   3.13.1. These signs have a red background with a white inscription and are used to denote:
       3.13.1.1. An entrance to a runway or critical area and;
       3.13.1.2. Areas where an aircraft is prohibited from entering.
   3.13.2. Typical mandatory signs and applications are:
       3.13.2.1. Runway Holding Position Sign. This sign is located at the holding position on
       taxiways that intersect a runway or on runways that intersect other runways. The
       inscription on the sign contains the designation of the intersecting runway. The runway
 72                                                   AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


      numbers on the sign are arranged to correspond to the respective runway threshold. For
      example, ―15-33‖ indicates that the threshold for Runway 15 is to the left and the
      threshold for Runway 33 is to the right.

Figure 3.22. Runway Holding Position Sign.




      3.13.2.2. Runway Holding Position Sign at Beginning of Takeoff Runway. On taxiways
      that intersect the beginning of the takeoff runway, only the designation of the takeoff
      runway may appear on the sign, while all other signs will have the designation of both
      runway directions.

Figure 3.23. Runway Holding Position Sign at Beginning of Takeoff Runway.




      3.13.2.3. Runway Holding Position Sign at Intersection of Two Runways. If the sign is
      located on a taxiway that intersects the intersection of two runways, the designations for
      both runways will be shown on the sign along with arrows showing the approximate
      alignment of each runway. In addition to showing the approximate runway alignment, the
      arrow indicates the direction to the threshold of the runway whose designation is
      immediately next to the arrow.

Figure 3.24. Runway Holding Position Sign at Intersection of Two Runways.




      3.13.2.4. Position of Runway Holding Position Signs. A runway holding position sign on
      a taxiway will be installed adjacent to holding position markings on the taxiway
      pavement. On runways, holding position markings will be located only on the runway
      pavement adjacent to the sign, if the runway is normally used by air traffic control for
      LAHSO operations or as a taxiway.
      3.13.2.5. Runway Approach Area Holding Position Sign. At some airports, it is
      necessary to hold an aircraft on a taxiway located in the approach or departure area for a
      runway so that the aircraft does not interfere with operations on that runway. In these
      situations, a sign with the designation of the approach end of the runway followed by a
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 73


      ―dash‖ (-) and letters ―APCH‖ will be located at the holding position on the taxiway.
      Holding position markings will be located on the taxiway pavement. An example of this
      sign is shown in below. In this example, the sign may protect the approach to Runway 15
      and/or the departure for Runway 33.

Figure 3.25. Runway Approach Area Holding Position Sign.




      3.13.2.6. ILS Critical Area Holding Position Sign. At some airports, when the instrument
      landing system is being used, it is necessary to hold an aircraft on a taxiway at a location
      other than the holding position described above in Holding Position Markings. This
      prevents vehicles and aircraft on the ground from interfering with the ILS signal
      transmitted to an aircraft on final approach. In these situations the holding position sign
      for these operations will have the inscription ―ILS‖ and be located adjacent to the holding
      position marking on the taxiway. At USAF airfields this sign will say ―INST‖.

Figure 3.26. ILS Critical Area Holding Position Sign.




      3.13.2.7. No Entry Sign. This sign prohibits an aircraft from entering an area. Typically,
      this sign would be located on a taxiway intended to be used in only one direction or at the
      intersection of vehicle roadways with runways, taxiways or aprons where the roadway
      may be mistaken as a taxiway or other aircraft movement surface.

Figure 3.27. No Entry Sign.
 74                                                    AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


3.14. Location Signs.
   3.14.1. Location signs are used to identify either a taxiway or runway on which the aircraft is
   located. Other location signs provide a visual cue to aircrews and ground crews to assist them
   in determining when they have exited an area.
      3.14.1.1. Taxiway Location Sign. This sign has a black background with a yellow
      inscription and yellow border. The inscription is the designation of the taxiway on which
      the aircraft is located. These signs are installed along taxiways either by themselves or in
      conjunction with direction signs or runway holding position signs. Taxiways are
      designated using all letters of the alphabet, normally starting with ―A‖.

Figure 3.28. Taxiway Location Sign.




Figure 3.29. Taxiway Location Sign Collocated With Runway Holding Position Sign.




      3.14.1.2. Runway Location Sign. This sign has a black background with a yellow
      inscription and yellow border. The inscription is the designation of the runway on which
      the aircraft is located. These signs are intended to complement the information available
      to aircrews and ground crews through their magnetic compass and typically are installed
      where the proximity of two or more runways to one another could cause pilots to be
      confused as to which runway they are on.

Figure 3.30. Runway Location Sign.




      3.14.1.3. Runway Boundary Sign. This sign has a yellow background with a black
      inscription with a graphic depicting the pavement holding position marking. This sign,
      which faces the runway and is visible to the aircrew or ground crew exiting the runway,
      is located adjacent to the holding position marking on the pavement. The sign is intended
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                   75


       to provide aircrews and ground crews with another visual cue which they can use as a
       guide in deciding when they are ―clear of the runway.‖

Figure 3.31. Runway Boundary Sign.




       3.14.1.4. ILS Critical Area Boundary Sign. This sign has a yellow background with a
       black inscription with a graphic depicting the ILS pavement holding position marking.
       This sign is located adjacent to the ILS holding position marking on the pavement and
       can be seen by aircrews and ground crews leaving the critical area. The sign is intended
       to provide aircrews and ground crews with another visual cue they can use as a guide in
       deciding when they are ―clear of the ILS critical area.‖ Note at USAF airfields this is
       referred to as the ―Instrument Critical Area‖.

Figure 3.32. ILS Critical Area Boundary Sign.




3.15. Direction Signs.
   3.15.1. Direction signs have a yellow background with a black inscription. The inscription
   identifies the designation(s) of the intersecting taxiway(s) leading out of the intersection that
   an aircrew or ground crew would normally be expected to turn onto or hold short of. An
   arrow indicating the direction of the turn accompanies each designation.
       3.15.1.1. Except as noted in 3.14.1.1, each taxiway designation shown on the sign is
       accompanied by only one arrow. When more than one taxiway designation is shown on
       the sign each designation and its associated arrow is separated from the other taxiway
       designations by either a vertical message divider or a taxiway location sign.
          3.15.1.1.1. Direction signs are normally located on the left prior to the intersection.
          When used on a runway to indicate an exit, the sign is located on the same side of the
          runway as the exit.

Figure 3.33. Direction Sign to Indicate Runway Exit.
 76                                                      AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


       3.15.1.2. The taxiway designations and their associated arrows on the sign are arranged
       clockwise starting from the first taxiway on the pilot’s left.
       3.15.1.3. If a location sign is located with the direction signs, it is placed so that the
       designations for all turns to the left will be to the left of the location sign; the
       designations for continuing straight ahead or for all turns to the right would be located to
       the right of the location sign.
       3.15.1.4. When the intersection is comprised of only one crossing taxiway, it is
       permissible to have two arrows associated with the crossing taxiway. In this case, the
       location sign is located to the left of the direction sign.
3.16. Destination Signs
   3.16.1. Destination signs also have a yellow background with a black inscription indicating a
   destination on the airport. These signs always have an arrow showing the direction of the
   taxiing route to that destination. When the arrow on the destination sign indicates a turn, the
   sign is located prior to the intersection.
   3.16.2. Destinations commonly shown on these types of signs include runways, aprons,
   terminals, military areas, civil aviation areas, cargo areas, international areas, and fixed base
   operators. An abbreviation may be used as the inscription on the sign for some of these
   destinations.
       3.16.2.1. When the inscription for two or more destinations having a common taxiing
       route are placed on a sign, the destinations are separated by a ―dot‖ (·) and one arrow.
       When the inscription on a sign contains two or more destinations having different taxiing
       routes, each destination will be accompanied by an arrow and will be separated from the
       other destinations on the sign with a vertical black message divider.

Figure 3.34. Destination Sign for Military Area.

3.17. Information Signs.
   3.17.1. Information signs have a yellow background with a black inscription. They are used
   to provide the pilot with information on such things as areas that cannot be seen from the
   control tower, applicable radio frequencies, and noise abatement procedures. The airport
   operator determines the need, size, and location for these signs.
3.18. Runway Distance Remaining Signs.
   3.18.1. Runway distance remaining signs have a black background with a white numeral
   inscription and may be installed along one or both side(s) of the runway. The number on the
   signs indicates the distance (in thousands of feet) of landing runway remaining. The last sign,
   i.e., the sign with the numeral ―1,‖ will be located at least 950 feet from the runway end.

Section 3E—Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS)

3.19. General Information
   3.19.1. FAA Only. SMGCS is implemented at selected US airports where scheduled air
   carriers are authorized to conduct operations when the visibility is less than 1,200 RVR. A
   SMGCS plan facilitates the safe movement of aircraft and vehicles on the airport by
   establishing more rigorous control procedures and requiring enhanced visual aids. This plan
   helps insure aircraft and vehicles remain in the areas intended for their use.
   3.19.2. ICAO Only. SMGCS is defined as a system that provides guidance to, and control or
   regulation of aircraft in the movement area. The system also provides guidance to, and
   control or regulation of all ground vehicles in the movement area. The term SMGCS is
   applied to the system of aids, facilities, procedures, and regulations and applies during all
   weather conditions.
NOTE:
 Several aerospace companies market surface movement radar and surveillance systems
(hardware) also called SMGCS that may be part of an overall SMGCS plan but should not be
confused with the plan itself.
      3.19.2.1. For ICAO airports, SMGCS is implemented in three stages:
          3.19.2.1.1. Visibility Condition 1. Visibility is sufficient for the pilot to taxi and
          avoid collision with other traffic by visual reference, and for ATC to exercise control
          over all traffic by visual reference.
 78                                                     AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


          3.19.2.1.2. Visibility Condition 2. Visibility is sufficient for the pilot to taxi and
          avoid collision with other traffic by visual reference, but insufficient for ATC to
          exercise control of all traffic by visual reference.
          3.19.2.1.3. Visibility Condition 3. Visibility is less than 400 meters RVR (1200 feet).
          Visibility is insufficient for the pilot to taxi and avoid collision with other traffic by
          visual reference, and also insufficient for ATC to exercise control over traffic by
          visual reference. This is called ―low visibility conditions‖.
   3.19.3. SMGCS procedures do not supersede established policies, procedures, rules or
   guidelines for airports, aircraft or vehicle operators, or air traffic control. Compliance with
   SMGCS procedures and restrictions is not mandatory for USAF personnel. However, to
   enhance the safety of low visibility ground operations, USAF personnel shall follow the
   guidance in the SMGCS plan to the maximum extent possible when conducting low visibility
   operations at an airport with such a plan.
3.20. SMGCS Training.
   3.20.1. When complying with 3.19.3 above, personnel involved in moving aircraft on the
   ground at airports with a SMGCS plan shall receive training prior to conducting low
   visibility operations at that airport. SMGCS training is airport specific.
      3.20.1.1. Training lesson plans will include as a minimum ramp operations, ILS critical
      areas, runway safety areas, obstacle free zones, stop bar lights, runway guard lights,
      taxiway centerline lights, clearance bar lights, runway lead-on and lead-off lights,
      geographic position markings, taxiway and runway hold position markings,
      movement/non-movement area boundary marking, other pavement markings, use of low
      visibility taxi route(s) chart(s), review of local taxi routes and procedures, and taxi
      procedures at turns requiring judgmental over steering.
          3.20.1.1.1. For aircrew personnel, document training completion in ARMS,
          MAJCOM specified training folder or other suitable product. Annotate the airport for
          which training applies.
          3.20.1.1.2. For maintenance personnel, document training completion in AF Form
          623, On The Job Training Record, or other suitable product. Annotate the airport
          for which training applies.
3.21. SMGCS Procedures (FAA).
   3.21.1. SMGCS procedures will be implemented when the RVR is below 1,200 feet.
   Additional procedures will be implemented for RVR below 600 feet.
      3.21.1.1. ATC is responsible to initiate and terminate each phase of SMGCS procedures
      IAW the SMGCS plan for that airport. Implementation and termination will be based on
      meteorological trends of increasing/decreasing RVR values and weather phenomena such
      as patchy fog and pilot reports.
      3.21.1.2. SMGCS procedures initiation/termination will be broadcast on the ATIS.
      3.21.1.3. Specific aircrew SMGCS procedures are in the SMGCS plan for that particular
      airport.
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  79


   3.21.2. When complying with the SMGCS plan, USAF personnel shall use the low visibility
   taxi route(s) chart(s) for that airport.
       3.21.2.1.
NOTE: Low visibility taxi route charts for CONUS airports are available only from Jeppesen.
Comply with AFI 11-202 Volume 3 General Flight Rules for use of commercially produced
publications.
   3.21.3. The following visual aids are required for operations when the RVR is below 1,200
   feet down to and including 600 feet RVR, except where others are specified in the SMGCS
   plan for that airport.
       3.21.3.1. Movement Area.
          3.21.3.1.1. Runway guard lights
          3.21.3.1.2. Taxiway edge or centerline lights
          3.21.3.1.3. Taxiway signs
          3.21.3.1.4. Taxiway hold markings
          3.21.3.1.5. Surface painted direction or location signs
       3.21.3.2. Non-movement Area.
          3.21.3.2.1. No additional visual aids required
   3.21.4. The following visual aids are required for operations when the RVR is below 600
   feet, except where others are specified in the SMGCS plan for that airport.
       3.21.4.1. Movement Area.
          3.21.4.1.1. Stop bar lights
          3.21.4.1.2. Runway guard lights
          3.21.4.1.3. Taxiway centerline lights
          3.21.4.1.4. Clearance bar lights
          3.21.4.1.5. Taxiway hold markings
          3.21.4.1.6. Surface painted direction or location signs
          3.21.4.1.7. Geographic position markings
       3.21.4.2. Non-movement Area.
          3.21.4.2.1. Taxiway centerline lights or taxiing assistance (ex. Follow-me vehicle)
3.22. SMGCS Procedures (ICAO). ICAO SMGCS procedures are not as standardized as
FAA. In general, ICAO SMGCS procedures for Visibility Condition 3 will be implemented
when the RVR is approaching or less than 400 meters (1200 feet). For many airports, this may
also be coincident with, and announced as, category II or III ILS usage.
   3.22.1. Compliance with ICAO SMGCS procedures and restrictions during Visibility
   Condition 3, or any time category II or III ILS are in use, are not mandatory for USAF
   personnel. However, to enhance the safety of low visibility ground operations, USAF
 80                                                      AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   personnel shall follow the guidance in the appropriate FLIP AP volume during Visibility
   Condition 3, or any time category II or III ILS are in use, to the maximum extent possible
   when conducting low visibility operations at these airports.
       3.22.1.1. Implementation and termination will be based on meteorological trends of
       increasing/decreasing RVR values and weather phenomena.
       3.22.1.2. Specific aircrew SMGCS procedures for Visibility Condition 3 (if any) are in
       the appropriate FLIP AP volume.
       3.22.1.3. When complying with the SMGCS plan during Visibility Condition 3, USAF
       personnel shall use the low visibility taxi route(s) chart(s) for that airport (if available).
           3.22.1.3.1.
NOTE: Low visibility taxi route charts for OCONUS locations are not published in DoD FLIP
or by Jeppesen. When planning to operate from an OCONUS airport with a SMGCS plan where
Visibility Condition 3 or ILS Category II or III operations are anticipated, USAF crews must use
any available means to obtain low visibility taxi route charts. This could include consulting the
host nation Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), host nation FLIP, or calling the airport
directly. Comply with AFI 11-202 Volume 3 General Flight Rules for use of host nation
publications.

Section 3F—Aircraft Arresting Devices

3.23. Emergency Arresting Gear. Certain airports are equipped with a means of rapidly
stopping military aircraft on a runway. This equipment, normally referred to as ―Emergency
Arresting Gear‖, generally consists of pendant cables supported over the runway surface by
rubber ―donuts.‖ Although most devices are located in the overrun areas, a few of these arresting
systems have cables stretched over the operational areas near the ends of a runway.
   3.23.1. Arresting cables that cross over a runway require special markings on the runway to
   identify the cable location. These markings consist of 10 feet diameter solid circles painted
   ―identification yellow‖, perpendicular to the runway centerline across the entire runway
   width. Additional details are contained in USAF Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 94-01,
   Standard Airfield Pavement Marking Schemes and AC 150/5220-9, Aircraft Arresting
   Systems for Joint Civil/Military Airports,.
   3.23.2. Aircraft operations on the runway are not restricted by the installation of aircraft
   arresting devices. However, aircraft T.O.’s may restrict operations of a particular mission
   design series (MDS) for taxi, takeoff, and/or landing over a particular type(s) of arresting
   cables.

Terms
Apron (ICAO)—A defined area, on a land aerodrome, intended to accommodate aircraft for
purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance.
Apron/Ramp (USAF/FAA)—A defined area on an airport or heliport intended to accommodate
aircraft for purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or
maintenance.
Blast Pad (FAA/ICAO)—An area prior to the beginning of the landing runway designated by
the airport authorities as being unable to support an airplane during a landing. This area may be
able to support an aircraft during taxi and/or take-off.
ILS Critical Area—A designated area on the airfield in the vicinity of the ILS antennas where
the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft on the ground will interfere with airborne reception of
ILS signals. Aircraft and vehicle access to the Critical Area will be strictly controlled by Air
Traffic Control to ensure integrity of ILS signals whenever the conditions are less than report
ceiling 800 feet and /or visibility less than 2 miles.
Judgmental Over-Steering— When the taxiway centerline does not provide an adequate turn
radius, the pilot may intentionally over-steer the aircraft nose wheel to keep the aircraft’s main
gear within the defined edges of the taxiway.
Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)—Operations which include simultaneous takeoffs
and landings and/or simultaneous landings when a landing aircraft is able and is instructed by the
controller to hold-short of the intersecting runway/taxiway or designated hold-short point. Pilots
are expected to promptly inform the controller if the hold short clearance cannot be accepted.
Low Visibility Operations—Operations conducted at airports when the visibility (RVR) is
below 1200 feet (400 meters). Refers to SMGCS operations.
May—Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
Movement Area (USAF/FAA)—The runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport/heliport
which are utilized for taxiing/hover taxiing, air taxiing, take-off, and landing of aircraft,
exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas. At those airport/heliports with a tower, specific
approval for entry onto the movement area must be obtained from Air Traffic Control.
Movement Area (ICAO)—That part of an airport to be used for the take-off, landing and
taxiing of aircraft, consisting of the maneuvering area and the apron(s).
AFI11-218_AMCSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  85


Night Operations—Operations conducted at airports during periods of darkness as defined by
FAR Part 1 and AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules. The time between the end of
evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American
Air Almanac, converted to local time.
Obstruction (permanent)— Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles parked entirely
within a designated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes
or lines on the ramp or another suitable means. AGE or vehicles parked in these areas must have
a parking brake set, chocks, or another suitable means to prevent inadvertent movement of the
equipment. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is
parked properly in it’s designated spot and is not moving.
Overrun (USAF)—An area beyond the take-off runway designated by the airport authorities as
able to support an airplane during an aborted take-off. The FAA/ICAO term for this is
―stopway‖.
Runway Visual Range (RVR) (ICAO)—The maximum distance in the direction of take-off or
landing at which the runway or the specified lights or markers delineating it can be seen from a
position above a specified point on its centering at a height corresponding to the average eye-
level of pilots at touchdown.
Runway Visual Range (RVR) (USAF/ FAA)—An instrumentally derived value, based on
standard calibrations, that represents the horizontal distance a pilot will see down the runway
from the approach end; it is based on the sighting of either high intensity runway lights or on the
visual contrast of other targets whichever yields the greater visual range. RVR is based on what a
pilot in a moving aircraft should see looking down the runway. RVR is horizontal visual range
not slant visual range. It is based on the measurement of a transmissometer made near the
touchdown point of the instrument runway and is reported in hundreds of feet.
Shall or Will—Instructions or procedures prefaced by ―shall‖ or ―will‖ are mandatory.
Should—Indicates a preferred but non-mandatory method of accomplishment.
Stopway (FAA/ICAO)—An area beyond the take-off runway designated by the airport
authorities as able to support an airplane during an aborted take-off. The USAF term for this is
―overrun‖.
Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS)—Operations implemented at
selected US and foreign airports where scheduled air carriers are authorized to conduct
operations when the visibility is less than 1,200 RVR. A SMGCS plan facilitates the safe
movement of aircraft and vehicles on the airport by establishing more rigorous control
procedures and requiring enhanced visual aids. This plan helps insure aircraft and vehicles
remain in the areas intended for their use.
Taxi Lane— A designated path marked through parking, maintenance or hangar aprons, or on
the perimeter of such aprons to permit the safe ground movement of aircraft operating under
their own power.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This change reflects the addition of AFVA 11-240, Airport Signs and Markings (paragraph 3.2.2,
3.2.3). Changed or revised material is indicated by a star.

3.2.2. AFVA 11-240 shows selected USAF airport markings and signs identical to those in
Section 3C, 3D, and 3E. For units based at USAF installations, display this visual aid where
maintenance and flight related operations take place. Suitable locations are aircraft maintenance
work areas and flight line buildings frequented by ground and aircrew personnel. This includes
vehicles operated on USAF airfields. Reference AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, for further
flight line driving information.

3.2.3. Units located at contingency or foreign airfields use the visual aid (FAA or USAF) that
most clearly depicts the actual markings at the airfield.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2005-1. 1.22.2 and 1.22.3 Text changed to
clarify taxi distances. Figure 3.2. Figure replaced; original was incorrect. 3.21.2. Note added
clarifying sources for low visibility taxi diagrams in the CONUS. 3.22.1.3. Note added
clarifying sources for low visibility taxi diagrams OCONUS. Attachment 1, Abbreviations and
Acronyms. Added terms ―AGE‖ and ―AIP‖ to list. Attachment 1, Terms. Added terms
―judgmental over-steering‖, ―obstruction (permanent)‖ and ―taxi lane‖. A bar ( | ) indicates a
revision from the previous edition.

1.22.2. Do not taxi or tow an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
monitoring the clearance between the aircraft and the obstruction.

1.22.2.1. Locally based aircraft are exempt when fixed taxi routes are marked and the obstruction
is permanent. See paragraph 1.22.2.1.3 for the definition of a permanent obstruction. This
exemption only applies to locations where aircraft are taxiing into or out of a parking spot. These
criteria shall not be applied on taxiways or taxi lanes where aircraft do not normally park. Taxi
routes must be used by the same model aircraft for which they were designed.

1.22.2.1.1. The exemption and waiver authorities specified in this instruction apply only to
existing facilities. Do not apply these criteria in the design of new facilities. UFC 3-260-1
Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, establishes design criteria for new facility
construction, including waivers to design criteria.

1.22.2.1.2. NOTE: MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no lower than WG/CC) may waive the
requirement for 25 feet clearance in taxi lanes only, but in no case can this be waived to less than
10 feet between wingtips and any portion of adjacent aircraft (also see paragraph 1.22.3.1.3.).
When the waivered taxi lines require the aircraft to turn, the waiver can only be applied to
aircraft with good visibility of the wingtips from the cockpit that do not require the use of
judgmental oversteering for turns (ex. C-21 or most fighters).

1.22.2.1.3. NOTE: Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a
permanent obstruction for purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2 through 1.22.3, provided it is parked
entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as
painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means. AGE or vehicles parked in these
areas must have a parking brake set, chocks, or another suitable means to prevent inadvertent
movement of the equipment. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent obstruction,
provided the aircraft is parked properly in it’s designated spot and is not moving.

1.22.2.1.4. CAUTION: When designing and marking parking areas as described in paragraphs
1.22.2 and 1.22.3, MAJCOMs and units must take into account the effects of wing and tail

growth, landing gear geometry, and use of judgmental over-steering during turns, as applicable,
to insure clearances are maintained during all phases of a turn into or out of a parking spot.

1.22.2.1.5. NOTE: For the purposes of paragraphs 1.22.2 and 1.22.3, locally based aircraft
include aircraft of the same type operating at another base with the same type aircraft, in parking
areas specifically designed for that type aircraft. For example, a KC-135 from Grand Forks AFB
ND operating in the KC-135 parking area at McConnell AFB KS or an F-15 from RAF
Lakenheath operating in the F-15 parking area at Seymour-Johnson AFB NC.

1.22.3. Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 feet to any obstruction.

1.22.3.1. This restriction can be waived by the MAJCOM/DO (may be delegated no lower than
WG/CC) under any of the following circumstances:

1.22.3.1.1. During contingency operations when compliance would restrict the mission. A
marshaller must be used.

1.22.3.1.2. When operating from alert, readiness, or protective shelters. A plainly visible
centerline must be painted along the exit path. A marshaller must be used.

1.22.3.1.3. Locally based aircraft when operating into and out of parking spots specifically
designed for those aircraft and the obstruction is permanent. These criteria shall not be applied
on taxiways or taxi lanes where aircraft do not normally park, or when environmental or
operational conditions (ice, snow, inoperative systems, etc.) may impact the normal turn
performance of the aircraft. Taxi routes shall be clearly marked. Taxi routes must be used by the
same model aircraft for which they were designed. See paragraph 1.22.2.1.3. for the definition of
a permanent obstruction. Parking spots shall be spaced to allow a minimum of 10 feet clearance
between any portion of adjacent aircraft. A marshaller must be used.

1.22.3.1.3.1. WARNING: Paragraph 1.22.3 sets out minimum clearances for aircraft taxiing into
and out of parking spots. These minimums may not be appropriate for all types of aircraft,
especially large swept wing aircraft with limited visibility from the cockpit and/or when
judgmental over-steering may be required for turning (i.e. C-5, KC-10, KC-135, etc.). When
turns are required, MAJCOMs will establish appropriate clearance standards for aircraft where
visibility is limited from the cockpit, judgmental over-steering is required for turning, or there is
wing or tail growth during turns.
