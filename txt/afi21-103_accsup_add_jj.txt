SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: An additional note under line number 13 for aircraft external tanks. Additionally,
LARS, SADL, upfront controller, MFCD, targeting pods, countermeasures set and AAR-47
systems were added as new subsystems for consideration with respect to equipment inventory,
status, and utilization reporting. Finally the ECM pod assembly was added as a separate
subsystem for consideration during aircraft status determination as well.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC)
aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
     be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
     another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and
     specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
     code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL)
     across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
     applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft;
     therefore, it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL that are
     applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded
     aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to
     their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report
     status using only the FSL and TNG columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would
     determine and report status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded
     aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual
     aircraft assignment code.
        1.4.1. A-10C unique mission codes are:
CAS—Close Air Support
FAC—Forward Air Control
*TNG—Tactical Training (ONLY for TF-coded aircraft)
*TST—Developmental Test and Evaluation (ONLY for CB-coded aircraft)
