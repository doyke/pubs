       The IG Complaints program IAW AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints, investigates
       possible violations of standards and provides redress or appeals where none already exists.
          • You have the right to file an IG complaint without fear of reprisal; but first, verify the
              facts and give your chain of command a chance to handle the problem.
          • Typically complaints can be best solved by your commander or supervisor. We
              encourage you to talk to your immediate supervisor/First Sergeant/unit
              commander/next level commander (as appropriate) before coming to the IG.
          • If there is already a process in existence to handle your issue we will refer you to the
              appropriate agency to handle your complaint.

       A hotline telephone has been set up for use in reporting fraud, waste and abuse. Call ext. 1180
       and leave a message.

       Stop by or send us a letter. We will be happy to talk with you.
