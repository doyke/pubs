SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change updates the DOP Program for the C-17 aircraft.
1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. The 445th Airlift Wing Vice Commander (445 AW/CV) serves as the DOP Program
   Manager. The DOP Program Manager ensures that a program focusing on prevention,
   investigation, training, and reporting is established.
 2                                                           445AWI21-105 31 AUGUST 2011


     1.2. The Wing DOP Monitor will be from the 445th Maintenance Group Quality Assurance
     (445 MXG/MGQ) Office. The DOP Monitor, appointed by the 445 AW/CV, will be listed in
     the current Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP). The Wing DOP
     Monitor will identify and develop training standards that ensure all maintenance personnel
     who are involved in on-equipment aircraft maintenance receive DOP training. The Wing
     DOP Monitor ensures that Local Checklist (LCL) 445AW 10-9, C-5 Dropped Object
     Prevention Checklist and 445 AW 10-10, C-17 Dropped Object Prevention Checklist are
     reviewed annually. The Wing DOP Monitor will investigate all dropped object incidents and
     make every effort to determine the precise cause to ensure a positive corrective action. Each
     and every material and/or design deficiency either suspected or proven will require that a
     deficiency report be submitted In Accordance With Technical Order (IAW TO) 00-35D-54,
     USAF Materiel Deficiency Reporting, Investigating and Resolution.
2. Dropped Object Awareness and Prevention Committee.
     2.1. The quarterly Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Foreign Object Damage (FOD) and
     Dropped Object (DO) Awareness and Prevention Committee will be attended monthly by the
     wing DOP monitor. This meeting is held in conjunction with the Airfield Operations Board
     (AOB) chaired by the 88th Air Base Wing Vice Commander (88 ABW/CV).
     2.2. All locally reported dropped objects will be included in the monthly MSEP meeting
     chaired by the MXG/CC. Discussion will include status of previous occurrences, corrective
     actions, improvements, recommendations, motivation, and/or suggestions, including
     initiatives and suggestion reviews.
3. Annual Training.
     3.1. Annual DOP Training Aircraft (ACFT) 000650 Course will be required for all on-
     equipment aircraft maintenance personnel.
     3.2. Course completion will require viewing the Dropped Object Prevention video
     (#614467) located in the 445th Maintenance Group Training Office (445 MOF/MXOT).
     3.3. Supervisors will ensure DOP training requirements are documented in the appropriate
     training records and automated Maintenance Information System (GO81).
4. DOP Qualification Training.
     4.1. Commanders will appoint squadron DOP trainers by letter, and forward a copy to the
     445 MXG/MGQ. DOP trainers will be 7-levels that are DOP inspection qualified. Trainers
     will certify that individuals have completed the annual DOP training (ACFT 000650),
     reviewed the applicable DOP PowerPoint presentation on the 445 MXG/MGQ SharePoint
     site, and received adequate On the Job Training (OJT) using the guidance in LCL 445AW
     10-9 or LCL 445AW 10-10 on the applicable weapon system prior to certifying an individual
     as DOP-inspection qualified.
     4.2. Upon completion of the above-mentioned prerequisites the individual will be loaded in
     G081 via AF Form 2426 utilizing course code WPAT 000305 C-17 DOPP Panel Inspection
     or WPAT 000310 C-5 DOPP Panel Inspection, as it applies.
     4.3. The 445 MXG/MGQ may, when deemed necessary, provide wing-wide training to
     ensure an effective DOP Program is maintained.
445AWI21-105 31 AUGUST 2011                                                                   3


5. Investigations and Reporting.
   5.1. Anyone suspecting a dropped object will immediately notify the Production
   Superintendent or if unavailable the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). A discrepancy
   will be entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, by
   the individual discovering the missing object.
   5.2. MOC will notify all parties IAW Check Sheet 3-10, DO, immediately. NOTE: No
   maintenance of any type will be performed or accomplished to repair or replace the dropped
   object until the Wing DOP Monitor performs an investigation. Investigation will attempt to
   determine and identify any material design deficiency/failure, personnel error, or repeat
   trends. The Wing DOP Monitor will initiate referral reports to ensure actions are taken to
   correct trends identified. Aircraft impoundment will be directed by the MXG/CC or
   designated representative as required or warranted, and follow 445 Maintenance Operating
   Instruction (MOI) 21-123, Aircraft Impoundment.
   5.3. Wing DOP Monitor or Quality Assurance Chief will notify the 445th Airlift Wing
   Commander (445 AW/CC), 445th Operations Group Commander (445 OG/CC), MXG/CC
   and 445th Airlift Wing Safety (445 AW/SE).
   5.4. Initial dropped object report will be provided to the AFRC/A4M and 4AF/A4M via
   telephone, e-mail, or message. NOTE: Any dropped object involving casualties, property
   damage, or likely adverse publicity, will be reported IAW AFI 10-206, Operational
   Reporting. Within three duty days after the occurrence a formal report will be accomplished
   utilizing the guideline established IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
   Management. The report will be forwarded to AFRC/A4M and 4AF/A4M. Courtesy copies
   will be forwarded to AW/CC, AW/CV, AW/SE, OG/CC, MXG/CC, Maintenance
   Superintendents, Production Superintendent, and 88 Mission Support Group/Base Supply
   (MSG/LGRS).
6. Inspection Requirements.
   6.1. LCL 445AW 10-9 or LCL 445AW 10-10 will be performed prior to each flight for the
   established “second look” program.
   6.2. Document the AFTO Form 781A using a “Red X” symbol.
   6.3. Individual performing the inspection will document the inspection completion in the
   corrective action block, sign the “inspected by” block, and initial over the symbol. NOTE:
   If exterior panel inspection cannot be accomplished due to weather circumstances or
   operational constraints, then the individual will annotate all areas not performed and reason
   why it could not be performed in the corrective action block of the AFTO Form 781A. If
   maintenance has not been performed recently on the vertical or horizontal stabilizer areas
   you may verify from the ground if the requirements are met IAW LCL 445AW 10-9 or LCL
   445AW 10-10. All inspections will meet Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
   (AFOSH), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and 445 AWI 91-301,
   Fall Protection Program standards for proper fall protection and or fall restraint. The areas
   of performance of the assigned weapon system will dictate protection versus restraint.
4                                                         445AWI21-105 31 AUGUST 2011


    6.4. Special attention must be given to “last minute” (Red Ball) maintenance actions. The
    Production Superintendent/Expediter will ensure that a localized DOP inspection is
    performed and documented in the 781A on the area disturbed during the maintenance action.
    6.5. All Exceptional Release (ER) authorities will ensure that LCL 445AW 10-9 or LCL
    445AW 10-10 has been performed prior to each flight.
