SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. 2.6.9 requires
flights debrief specific aspects of in-flight execution. 2.7.4 clarifies IR/VR and MOA low
altitude chart requirements. 4.2 certification for BRNAV operations 6.3 procedures significantly
changed. Additional guidance included in paragraph 6.3.1.2 concerning Bomb Steer and LAR
checks with weapons during combat operations. 6.3.1.3 provides guidance on weapon
employment restrictions, pre-release checks, target location confirmation, and multiple weapon
deliveries in night or IMC conditions. Guidance on Single WSO Flights added in 7.3 Lift/Wing
Sweep Effects Demonstration and Afterburner/Speed Brake Demonstration no longer restricted
in paragraph 7.5 Night Visual Formation guidance in 7.7.1 Copilot Air Refueling restriction no
longer applicable IAW AFI 11-2B-1V1 in 7.9.5 and has been removed. Low Altitude Limitations
guidance in paragraph 7.10 restricts normal low altitude training to 500 feet AGL, but permits
200 feet AGL TF for approved, formal syllabi or test sorties during Day/VMC conditions. Show
of Force guidance added in 7.10.1.5 OG/CC approval is required in 7.13.2 and 7.13.3 for high
crosswind and steady state wind conditions. OG/CC permitted to authorize aircraft recovery
within maximum flight manual limitations in 7.13.4 Paragraph 7.14.3 requires two primary
attitude modes (INS and GSS) be operational for night and IMC flight. 7.15.5 defines when
aircrew will declare an in-flight emergency. 7.17.4 permits aircrew to open weapon bay doors
with OG/CC approval during contingency operations to check system.. Attachment 2 updates
and separates Briefing Guides into Attachments 2, 3, and 8. New specialized Surface Attack,
Close Air Support / Time Sensitive Targeting / Armed Reconnaissance, and Dissimilar Air
Combat Tactics (DACT) / Intercept mission brief guidance have been included in Attachments
4, 5, and 6. Table A11.1 updates Traffic Pattern and Landing Limitations and Restrictions to
coincide with universal pilot guidance in AFI 11-2B-1V1. The term qualification was changed to
certification throughout where qualification reference did not require AF Form 8/8a
documentation. This instruction incorporates numerous administrative changes and increased
standardization with other Combat Air Forces (CAF) aircraft Mission-Design Series (MDS)
operating procedures.

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Flight Manuals. Aircrew will maintain applicable B-1 Technical Orders (T.O.) IAW AFI
11-215, Except for publications required for flight (e.g. checklists), aircrew are not required to
maintain T.O.s while on Temporary Duty (TDY) or deployed.
2.2. Local Aircrew Aids. Units will develop locally produced aircrew aids and provide an
information copy to HQ ACC/A3TV and Number Air Force (NAF) OPR. As a minimum,
include the following information in sequence:
   2.2.1. Briefing guides (See suggested guides in Attachments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).
   2.2.2. Tabulated takeoff and landing data, including emergency takeoff and landing data.
   2.2.3. Weight and balance data for calculating local aircraft configurations.
   2.2.4. Terrain following (TF) minimum mach tabulated data for in-flight TF check and low
   altitude operations.
   2.2.5. Tabulated charts for Service Ceiling (SC) and Optimum Cruise (OC).
   2.2.6. Divert, alternate, and emergency base information including runway data,
   approximate course/distance/estimated time en route (ETE), coordinates, and fuel required.
   2.2.7. Hung weapons procedures, jettison/bailout areas, and hot brake areas/procedures.
   2.2.8. On Scene Commander Procedures.
   2.2.9. Other information as deemed necessary the units.
2.3. Mission Planning Responsibility. Individual aircrews, unit operations, and intelligence
functions jointly share responsibility for mission planning. The Mission Lead has the final
responsibility for the accuracy of mission planning.
2.4. General Procedures:
   2.4.1. Aircrew will accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission
   accomplishment, to include fuel requirements, chart preparation, and takeoff and landing data
   using any certified computer based mission planning system. Until planning systems are
   certified for fuel computations, mission planners will cross-check fuel calculations for
   accuracy.
   2.4.2. Substitutions. Unit operations supervisors (or higher) may make crew substitutions as
   long as the substitute crewmember is thoroughly briefed and understands all aspects of the
   mission.
   2.4.3. Standards. Aircrews will use the B-1 Mission Standards to the maximum extent
   possible. The B-1 Mission Standards do not replace established T.O.s or flight regulations.
   The OPR for the B-1 Mission Standards is the 77 Weapons School Squadron (WPS).
   Forward recommendations for change to the 77 WPS Director of Operations (DO).

        standards in support of the unit’s mission. The operational commander for the level to
        which the standard applies is the approval authority.
        2.4.3.2. Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation (OGV) functions will review
        all standards for standardization and compliance with AFI 11-series guidance and
        forward a copy to their parent MAJCOM/DRU/FOA.
     2.4.4. B-1 Weapons Attack Guide (WAG). The B-1 WAG is intended to aid aircrews in
     mission planning and for use during flying operations. It does not relieve aircrew from
     compliance with established T.O.s or flight regulations. Aircrew retain the responsibility of
     ensuring information referenced from the B-1 WAG is current, complete, and accurate in
     accordance with applicable sources. The OPR for the B-1 WAG is the 77 WPS. Forward
     recommendations for change to the 77 WPS/DO.
2.5. Fuel Planning.
     2.5.1. Fuel Conservation. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a
     limited commodity and precious resource. Aircrew will consider fuel optimization
     throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Excessive fuel adds to aircraft
     gross weight and increases fuel consumption. Aircrew should employ the following aviation
     fuel optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing
     mission/training accomplishment:
        2.5.1.1. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight routing for
        fuel efficiency.
        2.5.1.2. Delay engine start time when practical.
        2.5.1.3. Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads.
        2.5.1.4. Establish procedures to ensure timely notification                 of    mission
        changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time.
        2.5.1.5. Minimize enroute delays and fly enroute airspeeds appropriate for efficiency.
        2.5.1.6. When cruise legs exceed 1 hour, aircrews should use the Fuel Center of Gravity
        Management System (FCGMS) optimum cruise mode and attempt to fly at or near the
        optimum cruise altitude and angle of attack (AOA) to the maximum extent possible.
        2.5.1.7. Aircrew should implement in-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles
        and power settings for efficient fuel usage.
     2.5.2. Table 2 1. lists approved estimated fuel flows to use when determining fuel
     requirements. Should more detailed fuel planning be required refer to the T.O. 1B-1B-1-1,
     Performance Data.

2.6. Briefing/Debriefing.
   2.6.1. All crewmembers will attend the mission briefing. Mission Leads will use briefing
   guides as a reference for the preparation and presentation of the mission briefing.
   Attachments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 contain suggested briefing guides. Units may use locally
   developed briefing guides in lieu of suggested briefing guides. Mission Leads may brief
   items listed in any logical sequence, but do not need to cover specific items not pertinent to
   the planned mission.
   2.6.2. Mission Leads may brief items adequately covered in Standards as "standard."
   2.6.3. Mission Leads will ensure briefing start time provides adequate time to discuss
   required briefing items depending on complexity of the mission and crew capabilities.
   2.6.4. Mission Leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing which will promote
   safe, effective mission accomplishment. All formation flight briefings will cover flight
   member responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, mission priorities, and sensor management.
   2.6.5. Mission Leads will brief and emphasize obstacle/ground avoidance anytime low
   altitude operations are planned. For low altitude operations over water/featureless terrain,
   emphasize minimum altitudes and spatial disorientation. If low altitude weapon employment
   is planned, emphasize weapon release parameters including planned speed, altitude, fuse
   settings, planned track, weapon interval, fragmentation deconfliction, and time/track
   tolerances. Units will designate an OPR to maintain low altitude and weapon activity data.
   2.6.6. Mission Leads will brief an appropriate alternate mission for each flight if applicable.
   The alternate mission must be less complex than the primary and should parallel the primary
   mission. If not parallel, brief the specific mission elements that are different. Mission Leads
   may modify mission elements/events and brief them airborne as long as flight safety is not
   compromised. The Mission Lead will ensure all flight members acknowledge the changes.
   2.6.7. Pre-takeoff Meeting. Aircrew will accomplish a pre-takeoff meeting prior to stepping
   to the aircraft when they conduct the flight briefing prior to the day of the flight. The Mission
   Lead will ensure all crewmembers are briefed, at a minimum, on current/forecast weather,
   Notices to Airman (NOTAM) and any mission changes.
 10                                                           AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


   2.6.8. Deployed Operations, Exercise, and Mission Plan Fly-Fly Briefings. If all flight
   members attend an initial or mass flight briefing, the Mission Lead on subsequent flights
   need brief only those items that have changed from the previous flight(s).
   2.6.9. Debriefing: The Mission Lead will thoroughly debrief the mission. The Mission Lead
   may use Attachment 8 as a guide. At a minimum, the debriefing will include an evaluation
   of the mission objectives, desired learning objectives, lessons learned, execution errors,
   deconfliction contracts, in-flight execution of flight member responsibilities, mission/tactical
   employment priorities, and sensor management.
2.7. Chart Preparation:
   2.7.1. Planning. Aircrew flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), inside Military Operating
   Areas (MOA), or on Military Training Routes (MTR) in the Continental United States
   (CONUS) will supplement existing mission planning materials (e.g. Chart Update Manual
   (CHUM), Fligth Information Publications (FLIP) AP/1B, etc.) with either:
      2.7.1.1. Mission Planning System (MPS) chart with the following overlay options
      selected: Airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways, MTR, parachute jump and
      Special Use Area (SUA) boundaries.
      2.7.1.2. Sectional aeronautical charts.     Note: Use of sectional aeronautical charts in
      flight is not required.
   2.7.2. Aircrew flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater or host nation
   guidance on mission planning. If no guidance exists, use the best charts or MPS overlay
   options available to accomplish the requirements of paragraph 2.7.4
   2.7.3. Local Area Charts. A local area chart is not required if aircrew in-flight guides include
   jettison areas and divert information and provides sufficient detail of the local area to remain
   in local MOA or other assigned areas.
   2.7.4. Low Altitude Charts. On low altitude training flights, one member of the pilot team,
   the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO) and Defensive Systems Officer (DSO) will carry a
   chart. The chart will be of scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, noise sensitive
   areas, and chart annotations are of sufficient detail to allow individual navigation and safe
   mission accomplishment. Annotate charts with noise sensitive areas, location and dimensions
   of class B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields, and other potential high-density traffic areas
   (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultra light/hang glider/glider sites, etc.) within 5 nautical
   miles (NM) of any planned VFR route or airspace boundary. Applicable airfield approach
   control frequencies in the vicinity of class B, C, and D airspace will be annotated and briefed
   on all such flights. In addition, annotate and brief the intersection of crossing Instrument
   Flight Rules (IFR) Military Training Routes (IR)/ VFR Military Training Routes (VR) (if
   applicable) and any other possible areas of conflict. Review pilot’s and Weapon System
   Officer’s (WSO) low altitude charts for compatibility and accuracy.
      2.7.4.1. VR/IR Charts. Annotate all charts with headings, maximum/minimum route
      structure altitudes, minimum safe altitudes (MSA), and route abort altitude (RAA). If
      MSA changes along the intended route of flight annotate an MSA for each leg of the
      route. If the aircrews uses a single MSA they will clearly annotate it on every page of the
      chart.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                    11


      2.7.4.2. MOA/Restricted/Warning Area Charts. Aircrew using a single MSA will clearly
      annotate it on the chart. Aircrew using multiple MSAs or local MSAs within the
      operating area will ensure all MSAs and associated constructs are clearly defined and
      annotated on the chart.
      2.7.4.3. MSAs and RAAs will be a minimum of 1,000 feet above the highest
      obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within the lateral limits of the route or
      operational area, but in no case less than 5 NM either side of planned route corridor.

                                           Chapter 3

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Air Refueling.
   3.1.1. Air refueling operations are authorized along published or special tracks/anchors. In
   addition, aircrew may conduct en route refueling (i.e. ―random refueling‖) with Air Traffic
   Control (ATC) approval. For information concerning air refueling airspace, rendezvous
   types, and air refueling operations procedures, refer to ATP-56(B), Air-to-Air Refueling;
   Federal Aviation Administration JO 7610.4M, Special Operations; FLIP AP/1B, Military
   Training Routes; and T.O. 1B-1B-1, Flight Manual USAF Series B-1 Aircraft.
   3.1.2. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA):
       3.1.2.1. MARSA between the tanker(s) and the receiver(s) begins when the lead tanker
       aircrew advises ATC they accept MARSA for the formation.
       3.1.2.2. After the lead tanker declares MARSA, ATC assigned course or altitude changes
       prior to the rendezvous completion will automatically terminate MARSA. Once the
       rendezvous is completed, ATC may make heading and altitude assignments with the
       tanker’s concurrence and MARSA will remain in effect.
       3.1.2.3. After rendezvous, receiver(s) will remain within 3 miles of the tanker until
       MARSA is terminated.
   3.1.3. Rendezvous (RV).
       3.1.3.1. RV Delta (Point Parallel Rendezvous). Receiver aircraft shall arrive at the Air
       Refueling Control Point (ARCP) no earlier than the scheduled Air Refueling Control
       Time (ARCT) -5 minutes and depart no later than ARCT +10 minutes. If unable to meet
       timing tolerance, attempt to contact a unit scheduler/duty officer for a new rendezvous
       time. If unable to schedule a new rendezvous time, air refueling is permitted provided all
       aircraft receive ATC clearance.
       3.1.3.2. RV Golf (En Route Rendezvous). Aircraft shall arrive at the Rendezvous Point
       ±5 minutes of the scheduled rendezvous time. If unable to meet timing tolerance, attempt
       to contact a unit scheduler/duty officer for a new rendezvous time. If unable to schedule a
       new rendezvous time, air refueling is permitted provided all aircraft receive ATC
       clearance. Note: Aircrews must be aware arriving outside the –5 / +10 minute window
       for RV Delta or the ±5 minute window for RV Golf may result in a conflict with other
       aircraft scheduled in the refueling airspace. If a conflict arises between two formations,
       the formation within their timing tolerance will take precedence.
3.2. Low Altitude Training. Conduct low altitude training in specifically approved areas.
   3.2.1. Domestic Low Altitude Military Training Routes (MTR). Refer to FLIP AP/1B, for
   airspace restrictions and contact the airspace Point of Contact (POC) through the local
   airspace manager to ensure the most current information is used for planning.
   3.2.2. Route Criteria. Lateral separation is preferred to over-flight of noise complaint areas.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                         13


      3.2.2.1. TF/Visual Contour (VC) minimum altitudes will provide at least 200 feet
      clearance above man-made obstructions within the route corridor or five miles of the
      planned route, but in no case will be lower than the minimum altitude published in FLIP
      AP/1B. Where surface is the published minimum operating altitude in FLIP AP/1B, man-
      made obstructions less than 200 feet above ground level (AGL) were not considered in
      route design.
      3.2.2.2. For routes and other training areas not covered above, aircrew will use set
      clearance planes providing at least 200 feet clearance above man-made obstructions
      within the route corridor/planned routing or, they will avoid the obstruction by at least 2
      miles laterally.
  3.2.3. IR Training Activity:
      3.2.3.1. Scheduling. Comply with the scheduling requirements of the route
      originating/scheduling activity. Confirm entry tolerances with the scheduling agency. If
      the originating/scheduling activity does not provide entry tolerances aircrew will enter
      only at scheduled time ±2½ minutes. If the aircrew cannot make the scheduled entry
      within ±2½ minutes, they may use subsequent primary or alternate entry points/times
      provided the airspace has been scheduled and briefed.
      3.2.3.2. Instrument routes are one-way. While flying an IR do not turn more than 90-
      degrees off of route centerline.
  3.2.4. Hazardous Conditions. Relay any safety hazard (e.g. icing, turbulence, thunderstorms,
  bird concentrations etc.) through a Pilot Weather Report (PIREP) to the controlling agency
  and to any other aircraft operating in the area through flight service.
  3.2.5. Bird Strikes. Comply with Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program
  guidance IAW AFI 91-202, the US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and Air Force
  Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management
  Techniques. Generally, the hour before and after sunrise and sunset presents an increased
  threat of a bird strike, with migration seasons posing a significant hazard at different times.
  Units should check the Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) (http://www.usahas.com),
  contact their base Civil Engineering wildlife expert, or Air Force Safety Center BASH team
  for further information on times of increased bird activity.
  3.2.6. Weather Requirements. Aircrew will attempt to update weather information prior to
  entering training airspace if they anticipate any significant weather changes.
  3.2.7. Altitude Variation. Altitude variation is the difference between indicated pressure
  altitude with a local (QNH) altimeter set and actual (true) altitude above mean sea level
  (MSL). Pilot-to Metro Service (PMSV) can provide forecast altitude variation. In flight,
  aircrew may approximate altitude variation by taking or evaluating an altitude calibration
  (ACAL) and comparing MSL altitude to Offensive Avionics System (OAS) altitude. (For
  example, a 2,420 MSL pressure altimeter reading and a 2,000 ft OAS altitude indicate a -420
  ft altitude variation). Also, if the aircraft radar altimeter indicates less than 600 ft while at the
  MSA/RAA altitude variation is greater than -400 feet.
      3.2.7.1. In an IR route when the altitude variation exceeds -400 feet the MSA/RAA
      altitude no longer provides safe terrain clearance. Aircrews are not restricted during day
 14                                                           AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


      and Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). At night or in Instrument Meteorological
      Conditions (IMC) aircrews may fly TF without using MSA; however, if an aircrew
      requires flight at MSA (due to a flyup or ―mandatory IFR‖ leg) the aircrew will abort the
      route.
      3.2.7.2. In SUA when the altitude variation exceeds -400 feet aircrews may continue low
      altitude operations if they can raise their MSA without exiting the airspace. Aircrews will
      increase their MSA by at least the amount of the altitude variation.
   3.2.8. Low Altitude Navigation. If aircraft position is uncertain in night/IMC, aircrew will
   maintain TF until they can clear the terrain in the direction of flight and then abort the route.
   3.2.9. Combat Altimeter Setting. During day VMC, aircrews may compute, set, and maintain
   computed true altitude in the aircraft pressure altimeters. Enter the training area using the
   latest ATC/ Flight Service Station (FSS) altimeter then compute a combat altimeter setting
   after established at TF or VC altitudes. Reset altimeters using current ATC/FSS information
   before entering IMC and before climbing to MSA/RAA altitude.
   3.2.10. Abort Procedures. Aircrew will use the following guidance when aborting any low
   altitude training area.
      3.2.10.1. VMC Abort Procedures. Maintain safe separation from the terrain and comply
      with VFR altitude restrictions. Squawk applicable (Identification, Friend or Foe/Selective
      Identification Feature (IFF/SIF)) modes and codes and attempt to contact a controlling
      agency. If unable to maintain VMC, comply with the procedures in 3.2.10.2
      3.2.10.2. IMC Abort Procedures. Immediately climb to, or above the computed
      MSA/RAA and maintain the preplanned ground track. If necessary, execute lost
      wingman procedures. If deviations from normal route/area procedures are required, or if
      the MSA/RAA is higher than the vertical limits of the route/area, squawk emergency.
      Contact the appropriate controlling agency and obtain an IFR clearance. If exit from IMC
      is not possible and an IFR clearance cannot be immediately obtained, cruise at the
      appropriate VFR hemispheric altitude until clearance is received.
      3.2.10.3. Individual Aircraft Abort Procedures. If an individual aircraft aborts during low
      altitude training, that aircraft will ensure formation deconfliction and immediately notify
      the flight of intentions.
      3.2.10.4. Multiple Aircraft Abort Procedures. If the entire formation must abort low
      altitude training, all aircraft will immediately establish radio contact while placing
      appropriate radars and air-to-air (A/A) Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) to operate/on.
      The lead aircraft will direct altitude separation, headings, and airspeeds. Establish
      positive radar and/or visual contact before the formation performs any climbing
      maneuver other than to establish immediate altitude separation and maintain a safe terrain
      clearance.
3.3. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Procedures. While both pilots on NVGs is the preferred
employment configuration, there are no restrictions to single pilot NVG operations when
qualification level and/or NVG availability precludes dual pilot NVG operations.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                     15


   3.3.1. During mission planning, aircrew will review lunar illumination and elevation,
   anticipated ground light sources, weather for the planned route of flight, and consider
   weapons/expendable effects for their impact on NVG operations.
   3.3.2. Each crewmember whose duties require the use of NVGs will preflight their
   respective NVGs IAW T.O. 12S10-2AVS9-2, Technical Manual Image Intensifier Set, Night
   Vision Type AN/AVS-9, and, when available, use the Hoffman ANV 20/20 or equivalent
   infinity focusing device. This device is preferred over an eye lane for NVG preflight.
   3.3.3. Do not fly with NVGs unless the cockpit is modified with NVG compatible lighting.
   As a baseline, use the guidance in Air Force Tactics Technique and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-
   3.B-1, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals--B-1, for proper NVG cockpit setup.
3.4. Formation.
   3.4.1. General. Flight/Mission leads will establish, brief, and debrief the contract, roles, and
   responsibilities and execution of each flight member. If any flight member cannot fulfill their
   basic responsibilities, contracts, or other assigned tasks, they will immediately communicate
   that information to the Flight/Mission Lead. Flight/Mission Leads will task element
   leads/wingmen based on their ability to fulfill basic responsibilities and other assigned tasks.
   For additional formation considerations, reference AFTTP 3-3.B-1, and AFTTP 3-1.B-1,
   Tactical Employment—B-1.
      3.4.1.1. Flight/Mission Leads will brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for
      every phase of flight and ensure every flight member understands the plan. All flight
      members are responsible for executing the briefed plan.
      3.4.1.2. Wake Turbulence Awareness. All formation members must understand wake
      turbulence/wingtip vortices hazards associated with flying in formation. AFMAN 11-217
      Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, contains information on the characteristics and
      effects of wake turbulence.
   3.4.2. Authorized B-1 Formations. For additional guidance, refer to AFTTP 3-3.B-1:
      3.4.2.1. Route/Observation. The Route/Observation position is 30 to 70 degrees aft of the
      lead’s or tanker’s 3/9 line with 150 to 1,000 foot aircraft separation.
      3.4.2.2. Fluid. The Fluid position is 30 to 70 degrees aft of leads 3/9 line with 1,000 to
      3,000 foot aircraft separation. The formation envelope is a ―donut‖ around the lead
      aircraft. Aircrew will use Fluid for those situations where they anticipate moderate
      maneuver potential (e.g., holding in a tactical environment, rejoins during departure,
      tactical recoveries, maneuvering around clouds or when striking an area target with near
      simultaneous time-over-targets (TOT)).
      3.4.2.3. Wedge. The Wedge position is 30 to 70 degrees aft of lead's 3/9 line with 3,000
      feet to 3 miles separation. The formation envelope is a ―donut‖ around the lead aircraft.
      3.4.2.4. Trail. The Trail position is aft of the 3/9 line with ½ to 3 NM spacing. Trail
      requires a minimum of 500 foot altitude separation if inside 1 NM. Trail does not require
      altitude separation if aircraft remain separated by at least 1 NM.
16                                                          AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


     3.4.2.5. Stream. The Stream position is flown with 3-9 NM separation. During low
     altitude, aircraft within a flight may fly different altitudes provided formation position is
     maintained. If not flying the briefed altitude inform the formation.
  3.4.3. Ground/Taxi Operations.
     3.4.3.1. When ice, snow, or water is present on taxi surfaces, pilots will increase spacing
     and reduce taxi speeds as appropriate.
     3.4.3.2. Every member of the flight will review and understand the takeoff data. Pilots
     should place particular emphasis on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations
     such as a wet runway, heavy gross weights, and abort procedures for formation flights.
  3.4.4. Takeoff. The minimum takeoff interval from the same runway is 30 seconds or when
  the previous aircraft in the formation is airborne, whichever occurs first. Abort calls are
  mandatory when any formation member aborts the takeoff.
  3.4.5. Departure:
     3.4.5.1. VMC. Close to and maintain the prebriefed formation. No calls are required as
     long as the wingman maintains visual contact.
     3.4.5.2. IMC. All aircraft will follow the Blind procedures in paragraphs 3.4.8.2 until all
     trailing aircraft establish radar and/or visual contact, and called ―Tied‖ or ―Visual‖. After
     that point, no further radio calls are required. If radar and visual contact is subsequently
     lost, resume the Blind procedures.
  3.4.6. Rejoins:
     3.4.6.1. Mission Leads will brief airspeed and configuration.
     3.4.6.2. Mid-Mission Rejoins. A mid-mission rejoin should provide sufficient time
     beyond the planned rendezvous point to affect the rejoin. Prior to the rendezvous lead
     will be directive by specifying altitudes for all aircraft, airspeed, heading, and formation
     position for the wingman (or wingmen) to assume.
     3.4.6.3. During Night/IMC rejoins, wingmen will maintain 1,000 feet of vertical
     separation until rejoined. During Day/VMC rejoins, wingmen will maintain 1,000 feet of
     vertical separation until they establish visual contact.
  3.4.7. Lead/Position Changes. During a lead change the Flight Lead will transfer all
  navigation, lead position, command and control (C2) communications and tactical flight call
  sign to the wingman. During a position change the Flight Lead will transfer only tactical
  navigation and the lead position unless briefed otherwise. The Flight Lead reserves the right
  to maneuver the formation and/or direct a position change back at any time and will provide
  specific guidance during the mission brief or at the time of position change execution for all
  other delegation of duties or responsibilities (radios, profile management, etc.).
     3.4.7.1. Lead/Position Change in IMC. In IMC, lead will initiate a lead/position change
     from a stabilized wings level attitude. Maneuvering aircraft will maintain at least ½ NM
     lateral separation from all other aircraft.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                      17


     3.4.7.2. Lead/Position Change in VMC. Flight leads will not initiate a lead/position
     change, unless the aircraft assuming the lead is in a position from which they can safely
     initiate the lead/position change and maintain visual contact.
     3.4.7.3. All lead changes will ensure a positive transfer of lead authority is
     accomplished.
  3.4.8. Flight-path Deconfliction:
     3.4.8.1. Apply the following rules for flight path deconfliction during maneuvering.
         3.4.8.1.1. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction.
         3.4.8.1.2. Lead becomes responsible for deconfliction when the wingman calls
         "Blind" or maneuvering places lead within the wingman’s "blind cone."
         3.4.8.1.3. Except when maneuvers place the wingman in front of lead, wingmen must
         maneuver relative to the flight lead and maintain visual contact. Normally, wingmen
         should cross above lead when deconfliction is required.
     3.4.8.2. Blind Calls. Use the following procedures when visual and radar contact within
     the formation is lost.
         3.4.8.2.1. When any flight member calls "Blind," the other flight member(s) will
         immediately respond with "Visual,‖ Tied," or "Blind." If ―Blind,‖ flight members will
         also report location and altitude. If the other flight member(s) responds with ‖Visual‖
         or ‖Tied‖ they are responsible for deconfliction until the first crew regains contact
         and calls ―Visual‖ or ―Tied.‖
         3.4.8.2.2. When all flight members are blind the Flight Lead will take action to
         establish and maintain altitude separation, and will call initiating and rolling out of all
         turns, starting any climbs or descents, passing each 5,000 foot altitude increment and
         leveling off. Flight members will maintain altitude separation until visual or radar
         contact is regained.
         3.4.8.2.3. When there is not a timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind" call
         and altitude separation is in doubt, the flight member initiating the ―Blind‖ call will
         call ―Knock-It-Off,‖ maneuver away from the last known position of the other flight
         member(s) and increase vertical spacing. Use Lost Wingman procedures in paragraph
         7.8 if the situation warrants. Refer to AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and
         Procedures, for Knock-It-Off procedures.
  3.4.9. Operations Check (Ops Checks). Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe
  mission accomplishment.
     3.4.9.1. Aircrew will perform Ops Checks:
         3.4.9.1.1. At level-off after takeoff.
         3.4.9.1.2. Prior to each Dissimilar Air Combat Tactics (DACT) engagement or
         intercept.
         3.4.9.1.3. Prior to entering an air-to-surface range and after departing the range.
         3.4.9.1.4. Following air refueling.
18                                                         AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


     3.4.9.2. Aircrew will, at a minimum, check the following items during Ops Checks:
         3.4.9.2.1. Central Air Data Computers (CADC) (AOA indicators within .8 degrees)
         3.4.9.2.2. Hydraulic panel
         3.4.9.2.3. Engine instruments
         3.4.9.2.4. Fuel controls/total fuel
         3.4.9.2.5. Oxygen system
         3.4.9.2.6. Electrical system
         3.4.9.2.7. Cabin altitude
         3.4.9.2.8. Automatic Flight Control System Mode Select Panel
         3.4.9.2.9. Surface Position Indicator (SPI) (stab position)
         3.4.9.2.10. Ejection seat status
         3.4.9.2.11. Nearest emergency airfield.
     3.4.9.3. For formation flights, Mission Leads will initiate ops checks.
  3.4.10. Radio Procedures:
     3.4.10.1. The Flight Lead or Mission Lead will develop and brief a communication plan.
     3.4.10.2. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio normally will be the primary means of
     communication between aircraft. Do not fly formation on training sorties without
     interplane communications capability, except in an emergency. Except for loss of radios,
     all flight members will maintain a common frequency. All capable aircraft should
     monitor the same ATC frequency unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
     3.4.10.3. Unless directed otherwise in operational plans, formation aircraft should use
     individual call signs during rejoins, air refueling operations, after formation breakup and
     during emergency situations.
     3.4.10.4. Use brevity codes and other terminology IAW AFTTP 3-2.5, Multi-Service
     Brevity Codes; AFI 11-214; AFTTP 3-1.B-1. Tactical Employment—B-1; and B-1
     Mission Standards.
     3.4.10.5. No Radio (NORDO) Procedures.
         3.4.10.5.1. During VMC, use the following guidance for mutual support of a
         NORDO aircraft in the formation.
            3.4.10.5.1.1. When the lead aircraft is NORDO, lead will inform the wingmen
            with a wing rock. The wingmen will acknowledge with a wing rock and move to
            the outer limits of Route/inner limits of Fluid. The wingmen will take the lead and
            the NORDO aircraft will move aft to establish Route/Fluid on the new lead.
            3.4.10.5.1.2. When a wingman is NORDO, the wingman will move to the outer
            limits of Route/inner limits of Fluid and give lead a wing rock. Lead will
            acknowledge with a wing rock and terminates maneuvering IAW AFI 11-214.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                 19


         3.4.10.5.2. The recognition of a NORDO situation in IMC may be difficult. Aircraft
         should remain in current formation position using all available means of deconfliction
         including radar, A/A TACAN, and altitude separation to the maximum extent
         possible. On arrival at the destination or divert base the formation should proceed to
         an instrument approach fix (IAF) with the NORDO aircraft in trail stacked down at
         the IAF altitude and the other aircraft 1,000 feet above. At the IAF the NORDO
         aircraft will execute the approach while the other aircraft will remain in holding,
         terminate MARSA with ATC, and coordinate for their own approach.
  3.4.11. Dissimilar Formations. Aircrew will apply normal formation procedures during
  dissimilar formation as applicable while giving special consideration to aircraft performance
  differences. The Flight/Mission Lead will brief flight members on flight responsibilities,
  proper formation position (to ensure adequate wingtip clearance), and aircraft-unique
  requirements for each phase of flight.

                              INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category. The B-1 is approach Category E. Use approach Category D
minimums in an emergency/divert situation where no Category E minimums are published
provided:
   4.1.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
   4.1.2. The aircraft gross weight allows final approach airspeed of 165 Knots Indicated
   Airspeed (KIAS) or less.
   4.1.3. The missed approach segment of the approach, if required, is flown at 255 knots True
   Airspeed (KTAS) or less. Aircrews must realize that at high pressure altitudes and high
   temperatures normal missed approach procedures may allow the aircraft to exceed 255
   KTAS and in turn place the aircraft outside the obstacle clearance guaranteed in the missed
   approach segment. Note: Units may request MAJCOM assistance to have Category E
   minimums published for airfields used on a recurring basis for emergency/divert practice
   approach work.
4.2. Navigation. The B-1 is approved to use internal navigation system (INS)/Doppler Velocity
System mode, with a radar position update at least every 3 hours, for operations in basic area
navigation (RNAV) (BRNAV) airspace or routes. An aircraft that has successfully completed a
precision alignment, may conduct BRNAV operations for a maximum of 7 hours in INS only
mode with no radar updates. The B-1 is not certified to fly RNAV terminal procedures to
include approaches, departures, and arrivals.
4.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Aircrew will not use vision restricting devices to simulate
instrument flight.
4.4. Airborne Instrument Landing Approach (AILA). Aircrew may practice AILAs
provided:
   4.4.1. A published approach procedure, as defined by AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules,
   is used with a designated final approach fix (FAF). This does not restrict accomplishing an
   AILA when cleared for a visual approach from the radar pattern.
   4.4.2. ATC clearance is obtained for the specific approach procedures selected.
   4.4.3. The appropriate ATC facility has been advised that an airborne directed radar
   approach will be flown in conjunction with the requested approach.
   4.4.4. VMC must prevail from the FAF to the missed approach point/decision height.
   Aircrew may only fly AILAs under lower weather conditions during emergency situations
   where no other compatible approach is available.
   4.4.5. The AILA is terminated and pilot navigation will be resumed any time it becomes
   apparent to any crewmember that the aircraft will exceed the parameters established for the
   published procedures.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                21

and range/area procedures when carrying weapons. Units will establish local procedures IAW
Chapter 8 of this instruction for this activity.
6.3. In-flight Procedures.
   6.3.1. Target and Guided Weapon Checks.
       6.3.1.1. Accomplish the Bomb Steer or Launch Acceptability Regions (LAR) check over
       open water or sparsely populated areas to the maximum extent possible.
       6.3.1.2. For combat operations, aircrew may accomplish Bomb Steer or LAR system
       checks with live weapons on board by over flying an en route point designated as a target
       subject to the following restrictions:
           6.3.1.2.1. The check is briefed and meets requirements of local instructions or
           Special Instructions (SPINS).
           6.3.1.2.2. All crewmembers are at their primary duty stations for the check.
           6.3.1.2.3. The OSO verbalizes all switch positions while running the pre-release and
           release checklists and the DSO confirms the switch positions.
           6.3.1.2.4. Modifiable Ballistics Weapons (MBW). The OSO will place the NUC
           LOCK/UNLOCK switch to LOCK and/or the CONV ARM/SAFE switch to SAFE no
           later than 1+20 Time-To-Go (TTG) to release. Pilots will place the pilot NUC switch
           to NORM no later than 1+20 TTG to release if weapons are loaded on a conventional
           rotary launch.
           6.3.1.2.5. Guided Weapons. The CONV ARM/SAFE switch will remain in the SAFE
           position for the LAR check. The OSO NUC LOCK/UNLOCK switch may be
           checked in the UNLOCK position and the pilot NUC switch may be checked in the
           PA & REL or REL position granted the LAR check is accomplished outside the
           weapon LAR and the MSL AUTO/MAN switch is not placed in AUTO.
           6.3.1.2.6. The crew will disable the target once the Bomb Steer or LAR check is
           completed.
           6.3.1.2.7. Store bay doors remain closed throughout the Bomb Steer or LAR check.
   6.3.2. Weapons Employment Training.
       6.3.2.1. Aircrew will release weapons only on designated weapon ranges or approved
       release areas.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                    23


      6.3.2.2. Aircrew will adhere to range restrictions, briefed release criteria, release
      clearance from the range control officer (RCO), and any other applicable employment
      guidance.
      6.3.2.3. Aircrew may accomplish Pre-Release checklist items prior to release when
      carrying weapons, however, the Bomb Release Mode Switch and the Missile Launch
      Mode Switch will both remain in MANUAL until release clearance is received, within
      range boundaries, and the aircrew is ready to release weapons.
      6.3.2.4. Aircrew will confirm the target location using valid on-board/off-board cues
      prior to weapons release to ensure on-range weapon impacts. Examples of available
      means include, but are not limited to radar, targeting pod (TGP), other aircraft sensors,
      map plots, data links, radio communications, talk-ons with joint terminal attack
      controllers (JTAC), RCOs, other aircrew members, etc.
      6.3.2.5. Aircrew may accomplish multiple weapons deliveries at night and/or in IMC if
      range patterns and procedures which ensure positive aircraft separation are established
      and briefed.
6.4. Hung Weapons.
   6.4.1. After an unsuccessful release, contact the RCO for authorization to release or jettison
   hung weapons in a suitable area, if required. Follow RCO instructions and T.O. guidance.
   The original target may be used for hung weapon jettison if coordinated with the RCO.
   6.4.2. If hung weapons are not jettisoned, the crew will accomplish the post release/abort
   checklist and return directly to home station or other suitable landing base, avoiding over-
   flight of populated areas. Air refueling is authorized to ensure safe recovery of the aircraft.
   Note: An In-flight Emergency (IFE) need not be declared for a hung swing arm provided all
   weapons on the rack reflect either a blocked (B), present (P), or not present (X) status on the
   WSO’s [D] page.
6.5. Simulated Weapons Attacks Following Actual Weapon Releases. Conduct simulated
attacks provided:
   6.5.1. No release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction exists.
   6.5.2. Post release/abort checklist is complete.
   6.5.3. Release system is in Full Simulation.

      AIRCREW AND AIRCRAFT OPERATIONAL LIMITS AND RESTRICTIONS

7.1. Scope. This chapter adds aircraft limitations and restrictions to those already specified in
flight manuals and apply to all aircrew.
7.2. New/Modified Aircraft Equipment/Weapons. Aircrew not qualified or certified in the
operation of new or modified aircraft equipment will not operate that equipment on any flight
unless under the supervision of a current and qualified instructor of like specialty unless
otherwise specified by MAJCOM guidance.
7.3. Crew Restrictions.
   7.3.1. Maximum number of individuals authorized in flight is four.
   7.3.2. Aircrew will accomplish seat changes only when the aircraft is at a safe altitude (i.e.,
   MSA during low altitude operations or traffic pattern altitude during transition). Pilots will
   not conduct seat swaps with only two pilots on board the aircraft.
   7.3.3. Single WSO Flights. Flight surgeons, third pilots, incentive flight participants, etc.,
   flying in the DSO position will be briefed on, at a minimum, the following:
       7.3.3.1. Equipment operations (ladder/hatch operation, power latch reset/EMUX control
       interrupt panel, Central Integrated Test System (CITS) monitoring, and aft station
       temperature control).
       7.3.3.2. Safety of flight indicators (flight parameter indicators (FPI) and attitude

         60,000 lbs             Min Fuel over Remote or Island (Alternate required)
7.7. Formation. Aircrews will not conduct or perform any of the formation positions described
in this instruction, or AFI 11-2B-1V1, until completing the appropriate formal training program
unless under the supervision of a qualified instructor.
   7.7.1. Visual Formation. Aircrew will only fly visual formations (Route/Observation, Fluid,
   Wedge, and/or Line Abreast (LAB)) during daylight hours (official sunrise to sunset). B-1
   visual formation with greater than a two ship element requires Operations Group Commander
   (OG/CC) approval.
       7.7.1.1. Equipment:
          7.7.1.1.1. Flight leads will tailor maneuvering for aircraft with degraded Stability
          Enhancement Function (SEF) capability.
          7.7.1.1.2. Both aircraft will maintain the same wing sweep, except during rejoins.
       7.7.1.2. Minimum Weather:
          7.7.1.2.1. Aircrew flying visual formation at or above 5,000 feet AGL will remain
          clear of clouds with at least 2 NM visibility.
          7.7.1.2.2. Aircrew flying visual formation below 5,000 feet AGL will remain in
          VMC with a ceiling no less than 1,500 feet AGL and 5 NM visibility.

          7.7.1.3.1. Aircrew will only fly in the Stream or Wedge position during tactical
          maneuvering below 5,000 feet AGL. Aircrew will not fly the Wedge position below
          500 feet AGL.
          7.7.1.3.2. Aircrew will not initiate or accomplish rejoins below 1,000 feet AGL.
 26                                                            AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


           7.7.1.3.3. Aircrew may fly in the Fluid or Route position below 5,000 feet AGL
           during departures, recoveries, or authorized flyovers.
   7.7.2. Route/Observation. Route/Observation is not a tactical employment formation.
   Aircraft will stabilize at 1,000 feet separation prior to proceeding closer to lead.
   7.7.3. Battle Damage Checks. When circumstances permit, flight leads should direct a battle
   damage check after actual weapon deliveries and/or prior to return to base (RTB). Do not
   perform the check at night or during IMC and fly no closer than Route formation spacing.
7.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. Aircrew will use the following procedures if they cannot
maintain visual contact and assure positive separation when flying visual formation. In any lost
wingman situation, immediate separation of aircraft is essential to maintain safety. Upon losing
visual and radar contact with the leader, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation,
the wingman will simultaneously execute the applicable Lost Wingman procedure. Once a
wingman executes lost wingman procedures, the Flight Lead/Mission Lead must clear the
wingman to rejoin.
   7.8.1. In wings level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition to
   instruments, inform lead, turn 15 degrees away and maintain new heading for 15 seconds,
   then resume course and attempt to acquire lead on radar. Ensure 500 feet altitude separation.
   Return to formation with lead’s permission or, if required, obtain a separate clearance from
   the controlling agency.
   7.8.2. On the outside of the turn (climbing, descending or level), transition to instruments,
   roll wings level, and inform lead. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
   resuming turn and attempt to acquire lead on radar. Ensure 500 feet altitude separation.
   Return to formation with lead’s permission or, if required, obtain a separate clearance from
   the controlling agency.
   7.8.3. On the inside of the turn (climbing, descending or level), transition to instruments to
   maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 10 KIAS to ensure clearance, and inform
   lead. Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed, and acknowledge
   wingman’s call. If lead acknowledges the lost wingman call and confirms lead aircraft is
   wings level, the wingman will, after 15 seconds, roll wings level, establish 500 feet altitude
   separation, turn to lead’s reference heading and attempt to acquire lead on radar. If lead does
   not acknowledge loss of visual contact, maintain established bank angle, establish 500 feet
   altitude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on radar, and with lead’s
   permission reform into trail formation position. If radar contact cannot be reestablished,
   obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency.
   7.8.4. At night, after establishing positive separation, all aircraft should display anti-collision
   and position lights to aid in reestablishing contact.
7.9. Air Refueling Limitations and Restrictions.
   7.9.1. Do not accomplish air refueling during training missions when:
       7.9.1.1. In-flight turbulence is encountered that, in the opinion of any participant, results
       in marginal control of the receiver aircraft while in the refueling envelope.
       7.9.1.2. The tanker or receiver has less than all engines operating (except in an
       emergency).
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                   27


      7.9.1.3. The tanker or receiver is unable to retract the landing gear (except in an
      emergency).
   7.9.2. Disconnect Malfunctions.
      7.9.2.1. Without tanker disconnect capability (including tanker manual operation without
      tanker disconnect capability or receiver emergency override operation) aircrew will air
      refuel only under the following conditions:
          7.9.2.1.1. When necessary to ensure safe recovery of the aircraft. Minimize contacts
          and contact time to that required for safe recovery of the aircraft.
          7.9.2.1.2. When necessary to complete contingency operations, deployment,
          redeployment, or when specifically directed by MAJCOM.
      7.9.2.2. Conduct emergency override (manual boom latching) training with receiver
      instructor pilot (IP) supervision. Brief procedures during mission planning. Coordinate
      receiver pilot and boom operator procedures IAW applicable refueling T.O.s. Receivers
      must demonstrate disconnect capability prior to accomplishing override operations.
   7.9.3. Air Refueling Breakaway Training and Envelope Limits Demonstration.
      7.9.3.1. Do not accomplish breakaway training or demonstrate envelope limits while in
      contact unless the receiver system is in normal and the aircrew has checked tanker
      disconnect capability with the applicable receiver by either a boom operator initiated or a
      boom limit switch disconnect.
      7.9.3.2. For breakaway training, the tanker pilot, boom operator, and the receiver pilot
      must coordinate the maneuver before its actual accomplishment. This coordination must
      include when the maneuver will occur and who will give the command of execution.
   7.9.4. Maximum Air Refueling Altitude. Normal training sorties should conduct air refueling
   at or below the maximum refueling altitudes at 1.3G available.
7.10. Low Altitude Limitations.
   7.10.1. Minimum Altitudes. Low Altitude Training is limited to no lower than 500 feet AGL
   on all training missions with the following exceptions:
      7.10.1.1. Aircrew, under FIC IP, 77 WPS IP, or 337 Test and Evaluation Squadron
      (TES) IP supervision, may fly Terrain Following during day/VMC conditions to 200 feet
      AGL in accordance with MAJCOM approved formal training syllabus, in support of
      approved test missions, or with OG approval.
      7.10.1.2. Test aircrew may conduct low altitude continuation training (CT) consistent
      with unit requirements and IAW current directives. Test aircrew CT minimum altitude
      limitation is the highest of the following: 300 feet AGL day and VMC, 500 feet AGL
      night or IMC, FLIP AP 1/B restrictions, or route clearance plane restrictions.
      7.10.1.3. Minimum altitudes for military training routes in FLIP AP/1B and those
      provided by the local airspace managers at the originating activity will take precedence if
      higher than the altitudes listed above.
      7.10.1.4. Functional Check Flight (FCF) qualified aircrews may fly at 200 feet to
      accomplish required bias checks on terrain following systems during a FCF.
28                                                           AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


     7.10.1.5. A ―Show of Force‖ is not a weapons delivery maneuver and will be flown IAW
     minimum altitude restrictions listed above.
     7.10.1.6. Minimum altitude for use of the targeting pod is no lower than aircrew Low
     Altitude Training (LOWAT) category minimum altitude.
  7.10.2. Minimum weather for TF/VC flight for aircrews not night/IMC TF certified is 1,500
  foot ceiling and 5 mile visibility for training areas or as defined in FLIP AP/1B, Military
  Training Routes for VR routes. TF operation above cloud decks in VMC conditions is not
  restricted.
  7.10.3. Aircrew will not fly visual contour flight at night.
  7.10.4. Night/IMC TF Operations. Only aircrew that are night/IMC TF certified or are
  conducting night/IMC TF checkout IAW AFI 11-2B-1V1, will fly night/IMC TF.
     7.10.4.1. The terrain following system must be fully operational to conduct TF
     operations. Additionally, both pilots will select TER FLW on their Vertical Situational
     Display (VSD) during night or IMC TF operations. One pilot may select BU on their
     VSD while the other pilot is in TER FLW during TF operations in day/VMC conditions.
     7.10.4.2. Pilots will not use first and second detent positions to maintain TF altitudes.
     During night or IMC, pilots will not use first detent other than to increase the set
     clearance plane or to climb to MSA/RAA.
  7.10.5. Do not use Offensive Radar Set (ORS) quiet mode during night/IMC below 5,000
  feet AGL.
  7.10.6. Do not initiate the penetration to low altitude or continue low altitude training if any
  of the following conditions exist:
     7.10.6.1. Any flight control system malfunction denies the pilot a safe margin of control.
     7.10.6.2. Loss of Real Beam Ground Map (RBGM) and High Resolution Ground Map
     (HRGM), during IMC. Aircrew may perform RBGM and HRGM off/out operations
     during VMC only. During night VMC, climb to MSA until radar malfunction is
     corrected.

     The OSO and DSO must each have at least one operable MFD.
     7.10.6.6. Loss of all attitude reference systems (Gyro Stabilization System (GSS) and
     INS). Both aft station attitude indicators must be fully operational for low altitude
     operations during night/IMC.
     7.10.6.7. Loss of all radar altimeter channels. Aircrew may continue low altitude activity
     at MSA.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                       29


7.11. Radar Restrictions. Obtain permission to activate ORS Electronic Protection (EP) modes
through HQ ACC/A3TW on a case-by-case basis. In order to operate the ORS with EP enabled,
the airspace must be clear of Radio Frequency (RF) collection assets. Additionally, the airspace
controlling agency must monitor for unplanned RF collection assets and have procedures to
terminate ORS EP operations if RF collection assets arrive.
7.12. NVG Restrictions.
   7.12.1. Do not use NVGs for low altitude visual contour flight. Do not use NVGs to fly low
   altitude below MSA without the TF system engaged.
   7.12.2. Do not use NVG’s during air refueling contacts or pattern operations. After takeoff
   do not use NVGs until reaching 2,000 feet AGL or MSA, whichever is higher. On arrival
   remove NVGs no later than the final approach fix.
7.13. Takeoff and Landing Limitations.
   7.13.1. Aircrews will not takeoff with a tailwind component in excess of 10 knots on a dry
   runway or 5 knots on a wet runway.
   7.13.2. Takeoff with crosswind components greater than 26 knots requires OG/CC approval.
   7.13.3. Landing with steady state winds in excess of 35 knots requires OG/CC approval and
   will be to a full-stop.
   7.13.4. Reference Table A11.1 for landing pattern limitations and restrictions. If mission
   requirements dictate, the OG/CC may authorize recovery within the maximum flight manual
   limitations.
   7.13.5. Aircrew will not practice no flap/slat full stop landings.
   7.13.6. Aircrew will not practice traffic pattern operations under the following conditions:

       system.
   7.13.7. Aircrew will not perform overhead patterns at night.
   7.13.8. Aircrew will not perform closed patterns unless required for safety of flight.
   7.13.9. SCAS Failure. Normal touch-and-go landings or low approaches are permitted with a
   PITCH AUG 1, ROLL AUG 1, YAW AUG 1, and/or SPOILER 1 caution light illuminated.
   7.13.10. Aircrew will make all landings within the runway touchdown zone (runway
   threshold to 3,000 feet). The optimum B-1 touchdown zone is 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet beyond
   the threshold.
7.14. Navigation Equipment.
   7.14.1. An INS must be operational as the prime navigation model for takeoff on all
   missions except for flight in the local area during day VMC. Missions outside the local area
   requiring INS in-flight alignment may launch with Operations Supervision approval provided
   VMC can be maintained until the INS is aligned.
 30                                                         AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


   7.14.2. Do not takeoff with the GSS inoperative (steady illumination of the GSS caution
   light).
   7.14.3. The two primary attitude modes (INS and GSS) will be operational for night/IMC
   flight.
   7.14.4. Selecting Dead Reckoning (DR) as the prime navigational model for training is not
   considered loss or degradation of the INS.
   7.14.5. Do not take off if the INS and GSS headings differ more than 4 degrees (unless
   staying in the local area under day VMC).
   7.14.6. Both aft station attitude indicators and one flight parameter indicator must be fully
   operational for takeoff.
   7.14.7. ACU Reloads and INS Air Alignments.
      7.14.7.1. Do not practice in-flight ACU reloads or INS coarse air alignments at night or
      in IMC.
      7.14.7.2. During any in-flight ACU reload or INS air alignment, practice or actual,
      maintain straight and level flight to the maximum extent possible and crosscheck VSD
      attitudes with the standby attitude indicator and the aft station attitude indicators.
      7.14.7.3. When the ACU complex and/or all INSs are not fully operational aircrew must
      maintain VMC to the maximum extent possible, regardless of GSS status.
7.15. Emergency Limitations.
   7.15.1. Do not practice in-flight emergency procedures with weapons loaded on the aircraft.
   7.15.2. Do not practice compound emergencies during flight (unless specifically required for
   upgrade training).
   7.15.3. Aircraft Operations with One Engine Inoperative. Aircrew will not takeoff with one
   engine inoperative from start of takeoff roll except during emergency evacuation, with wing
   commander approval or when directed by MAJCOM.
   7.15.4. During an in-flight emergency the most experienced or qualified pilot should make
   the landing. As in all situations the aircraft commander should balance the experience, skill,
   and proficiency of the crewmember flying against the complexity of the event to be flown.
   7.15.5. Aircrews will declare an IFE for any of the following situations:
      7.15.5.1. Any time an Emergency Procedure (EP) checklist states ―land as soon as
      possible.‖
      7.15.5.2. Any situation where aircrews refer to a T.O. 1B-1B-1 Section 3 Landing
      Checklist.
      7.15.5.3. Any planned landing with other than normal wing, flap/slat or gear position, or
      normal braking capability.
      7.15.5.4. In any case where current or foreseeable system failures could make immediate
      ground assistance (e.g., fire, medical, maintenance, supervision) advisable.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                  31


      7.15.5.5. If any doubt exists in the opinion of the aircrew or Supervisor of Flying (SOF)
      about the safety of the aircrew or aircraft’s performance.
7.16. Aircrew and Aircraft Limitations.
   7.16.1. Aircrews will not taxi, takeoff, or land when the measured Runway Condition
   Reading (RCR) is less than 9 without OG/CC approval.
   7.16.2. Structural Limitations. The following restrictions are a result of the Aircraft
   Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) and are imposed to increase the life of the airframe.
   Unnecessary additional weight and overall ―G‖ loading are key factors in reducing the life of
   the aircraft. Aircrew should be aware of the ASIP and realize smoothness in all phases of
   flight reduces unnecessary wear and tear on the aircraft. Unnecessary additional gross weight
   is the single most damaging factor to the aircraft. Units should reduce fuel loads to the
   minimum required to accomplish the mission.
      7.16.2.1. For gross weights between 275,000 and 300,000 pounds, aircrews are limited to
      a maximum of two approaches. This restriction does not apply when aircrews require
      multiple approaches for formal training or when necessary for safety of flight.
      7.16.2.2. Units will plan sortie fuel loads with ASIP and fuel conservation considerations
      in mind. Units and aircrew should request the minimum fuel load required to complete
      the mission and land at or below 230,000 pounds gross weight unless required fuel
      reserves dictate otherwise.
      7.16.2.3. Aircrew should restrict maximum afterburner climb-outs to syllabus training,
      ATC requests, safety of flight, or those climbs required for tactical threat/weapons
      employment.
   7.16.3. In addition to the requirements set forth in AFI 11-202V3, aircrew will not use
   cameras during takeoffs, landings, and any activity below 1,000 feet AGL without OG/CC
   approval.
7.17. Weapon Employment Restrictions.
   7.17.1. Aircrew should withhold weapons when the release will exceed aircraft T.O. limits,
   CG limits, briefed track/timing tolerances, or deconfliction for fragmentation.
   7.17.2. While carrying weapons, do not conduct:
      7.17.2.1. Simulated bomb or missile runs
      7.17.2.2. Unusual maneuvers
      7.17.2.3. Approach to stall
      7.17.2.4. Touch-and-go landings
   7.17.3. Aircrew may accomplish low altitude training and electronic attack (EA) with
   retained weapons provided they do not select or designate targets.
   7.17.4. During training missions, aircrew will not open weapon bay doors during flight with
   weapons on board other than for intentional release or jettison. During contingency
   operations, OG/CC may approve aircrew to open weapon bay doors with weapons on board
 32                                                        AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011


   with the intent of ensuring proper door operation provided the aircrew can confirm they are
   over sparsely populated areas, preferably over water.
7.18. Publications. Aircrew will carry on board for each flight, at a minimum, one full copy of
T.O. 1B-1B-4, Flight Manual Supplement CITS Operator USAF Series B-1 Aircraft, and Section
III of T.O. 1B-1B-1.
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                   33

Terms
Attempted Release—The OAS issues a release pulse in either automatic or manual mode with
all switches correctly positioned.
High Altitude Activity—Same as AFI 11-2B-1 V1, B-1 Aircrew Training. Above 25,000 feet
MSL (For weapons delivery events above 17,000 feet MSL).
Hung Weapon—A live or inert weapon that does not separate from the aircraft following an
attempted release. Note: Weapons not released due to being blocked, a swing arm malfunction or
a "slow switch status following squib fire" are considered retained if the "hung state" is removed
and the fault clears following corrective action by the OSO.
Lead Change—Used during formation when the ML/FL transfers all navigation, lead position,
command and control (C2) communications, and tactical flight call sign to the wingman. The
ML/FL will usually not maneuver the formation or direct a lead change back once a lead change
has occurred. Lead changes are typically used when an emergency or other extenuating
circumstances exist such that the ML/FL can no longer fully control the formation.
Live Weapon—Actual munitions containing a primary explosive charge (MK-82, CBU-87,
etc.).
Low Altitude Activity—Same as AFI 11-2B-1 V1, B-1 Aircrew Training. Below 5,000 feet
AGL.
Medium Altitude Activity—Same as AFI 11-2B-1 V1, B-1 Aircrew Training. From 5,000 feet
AGL to 25,000 feet MSL (For weapons delivery events from 5,000 feet MSL to 17,000 feet
MSL).
Mission Lead—The Mission Lead is the aircrew member responsible for mission
accomplishment. This includes planning, leading, and debriefing the mission. When
circumstances dictate, the Mission Lead does not have to be in the lead aircraft or position during
the flight.
Operating Altitudes—Altitudes for all U.S. military training routes will be published in FLIP
AP/1B, Military Training Routes. TF/VC altitudes will be based on a minimum altitude
published for the route or the clearance plane settings developed by local airspace managers at
the originating activity, whichever is higher.
Position Change—Used during formation to make the wingman the tactical flight lead. The
ML/FL will transfer only tactical navigation and the lead position unless briefed otherwise. The
ML/FL reserves the right to maneuver the formation and/or direct a position change back at any
time and will provide specific guidance during the mission brief or at the time of position change
execution for all other delegation of duties or responsibilities (radios, profile management, etc.).
Position changes usually occurs during training sorties where currencies/training requires it or
when a non-mission aborting system malfunction requires the wingman to lead the formation
while preserving two-ship employment.

Retained Weapon—A weapon still on board the aircraft with no release attempted or after
successfully releasing the intended number of weapons in a partial load. Weapons not released
due to procedural errors are retained. NOTE: Weapons not released due to being blocked, a
swing arm malfunction or a "slow switch status following squib fire" are considered retained if
the "hung state" is removed and the fault clears following corrective action by the OSO.
RNAV (Area Navigation)—A method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on any
desired course within the coverage of station-referenced navigation signals or within the limits of
a self contained system capability, or a combination of these.
Show of Force—A maneuver intended to warn or intimidate an opponent and to demonstrate
capability or will to act if provoked.
Visual Contour Flight—Operation at a predetermined altitude above the ground, following
contours visually with radar altimeter crosscheck.
Weapon—Any live, inert, or training munitions.

      CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                     EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A9.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before these weapons are detonated or dispersed
and then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack. Each air base should publish detailed CBRN
procedures. The following information is for use when base-specific procedures are unknown or
incomplete.
   A9.1.1. Counter-CBRN actions can be grouped into environments. First is where chemical
   or biological agents are dispersed from munitions or sprayed as an aerosol resulting in a
   cloud or rain of minute droplets. The nuclear environment is within range of any direct
   effect from a nuclear detonation. The radiological environment’s hazard is radioactive dust
   that can originate as fallout from a detonation or from dispersal of radioactive material
   without a nuclear detonation -- a dirty bomb. Procedures in all environments except nuclear
   are similar -- use procedures and protective gear to avoid skin contact with or
   inhalation/ingestion of agents or particles.
A9.2. Mission Preparation. Determine the CBRN status at planned launch, recovery and divert
bases. Know the current Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) level for relevant sectors
of the launch airfield. Plan ground ops to minimize the time between leaving shelter and takeoff.
If available, use additional aircrew to perform preflight duties to minimize flight crew exposure.
A9.3. Travel To/From the Aircraft and Aircraft Preflight. Step in the appropriate protective
ensemble and carry other protective gear as required. If possible, travel to and from the aircraft
in an enclosed vehicle to prevent contamination from agents or dust settling from the air. If
travel on foot is unavoidable, choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available
overhead cover (sun shades, buildings, etc.). If the aircraft is contaminated, ensure maintenance
has accomplished spot decontamination and avoid contaminating your person during preflight.
Take steps to avoid bringing contamination into the aircraft on helmet bags, map bags, etc. In a
potential CBRN environment, keep aircraft hatch closed as much as possible when outside
protective shelter. Post-mission, if there is any suspicion of aircrew contamination process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA).
A9.4. Ground Operations during Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent).
   A9.4.1. Before Taxi Out and After Taxi Back. If Alarm Red, or equivalent, occurs while the
   crew is outside the aircraft or in the chocks, shut down and exit the aircraft (if appropriate),
   take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require use of the ground crew mask. A
   hardened facility such as a hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum protection.
   Ensure the safety of supporting ground crew; use hand signals if necessary.
   A9.4.2. Ground Operations Outside the Parking Spot. Maintain contact with SOF, ATC,
   Command Post, etc. to remain aware of ground hazards and command direction. If Alarm
   Red, or equivalent, occurs while on the ground outside the chocks, there are two primary
   options. First is to taxi to an area available along the taxi route that provides increased
AFI11-2B-1V3 7 JANUARY 2011                                                                    65


   protection or dispersion. If protection is not available, the best option may be launch to
   survive contingent on fuel state, proximity to runway, nature of attack, etc. If protection or
   takeoff is not possible, attempt to exit the taxi flow. In extremis, especially with no
   protective mask available, select 100 percent oxygen and consider turning off the
   environmental control system and/or shutting down to avoid bringing agent/dust into the
   aircraft. Leave the aircraft hatch closed and await assistance.
A9.5. Airborne.
   A9.5.1. Contamination. Becoming contaminated by chemical or biological agents while
   airborne is very unlikely. If chemical agent contamination occurred prior to takeoff, flight
   will dissipate the agent to some degree, but will not achieve complete decontamination.
   Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower altitudes are more effective than
   higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured (gear and flaps extended) as long as
   possible to maximize the airflow in and around as many places as possible. There is no
   simple guidance for biological contaminants. If suspected, maintain maximum protective
   posture. If radioactive dust contamination is suspected, take measures to avoid skin contact,
   inhalation, or oral consumption. Seek decontamination assistance after landing
   A9.5.2. During the Mission and RTB. Use command and control agencies to maintain
   awareness of command intent and the status of primary and alternate landing locations. Do
   not attempt to land during Alarm Red, or equivalent, situations unless there is no other
   option. Follow C2 directions and hold or divert. If holding, try to wait until Alarm Red, or
   equivalent, is terminated. When able, obtain updates on airfield status, ground hazards, and
   taxi routing. If landing in Alarm Black, expect a contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
   Droplet settling following a chemical or biological airburst attack can take up to one hour. If
   you believe the aircraft was contaminated before takeoff or while airborne, notify C2.

                          STRANGE FIELD FAMILIARIZATION

A10.1. Use of Guide. The following procedures aid aircrew in their preparation for flights into
strange airfields. This outline is a guide and aircrew should review only the information that is
appropriate to their mission (for example, load bearing capacity need not be reviewed for flights
into airfields with similar aircraft). Reference AFI 11-202V3 for further guidance.
A10.2. General Information. During mission planning, aircrews should review the following
for each base of intended landing.
   A10.2.1. Airfield Qualification and Familiarization Manual (AFQM), where available.
       A10.2.1.1. Review available airfield information at www.jeppensen.com.
       A10.2.1.2. Units can contact their NAF/OV for username and password for website
       access.

   (NOTE 1)

1. Notes:
   1. Go around if not in the designated touchdown zone. Runway length and RCR consideration must
      permit an aborted takeoff using computed landing ground run distance.
   2. Weather required is 1,000 feet/2 miles visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher.
   3. Initiate go around/missed approach no lower than 200 feet HAT.
   4. Takeoff portion and unplanned go around requires symmetrical thrust.
   5. May fly published minimums with an IP.
   6. Full stop landings are authorized to T.O. 1B-1B-1 gross weight limits in an Emergency or Safety
      of Flight situation.
   7. Aircrews will not full stop when the measured RCR is less than 9 without OG/CC approval.
   8. SEF/SIS must be operational to conduct no-flap touch and go training without IP supervision.
   9. If mission requirements dictate, the OG/CC may authorize aircraft recovery within maximum
      flight manual limitations.
   10. Only aircrew under the supervision of an FIC IP (to include FIC IPs in operational units certified
       IAW AFI 11-2B-1V1) may perform FIC Only patterns. Only aircrew under the supervision of an
       FTU IP or an FIC IP may perform FTU/FIC only patterns.
