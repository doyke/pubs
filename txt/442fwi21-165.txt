1. GENERAL: This instruction standardizes scheduling practices and establishes procedures
for accounting of aircraft flying hours for the wing for the assigned A-10C mission design series
aircraft. Minimum topics include standardized flying windows, specific surge rules, quiet hours,
cross country take-offs and returns, minimum turn times, crew ready times, local schedule input
and publishing deadlines.
   1.1. The flying schedule will be published using the local time at Whiteman Air Force Base
   (AFB).
 2                                                             442FWI 21-165 7 AUGUST 2013


     1.2. The normal flying window is from 0930 to 2300.
     1.3. Long duration sorties with a scheduled land time after 2300 requires 442 FW/CC
     approval and will not be scheduled to land after 0200.
     1.4. During Unit Training Assemblies (UTA), the first take-off time should not be scheduled
     earlier than 0900 and last land should not be later than 1400.
     1.5. After night flying the previous day, the first take-off will be scheduled no earlier than
     1000.
     1.6. After a non-UTA weekend, the first take-off will be scheduled no earlier than 1100.
2. Minimum Turn Time.
     2.1. The recovery time between scheduled land and scheduled take-off will be no less than
     2.5 hours.
     2.2. The normal turn pattern will not exceed 10X8. Exceptions will be coordinated at the
     monthly and/or weekly scheduling meetings.
3. Quiet Hours. Quiet hours are established IAW Whiteman AFB Instruction 11-1, WAFB
Wing Scheduling.
4. Cross country missions.
     4.1. Cross-country missions will be printed in the weekly flying schedule. Cross country
     sorties will not be counted in the local schedule for the days not on station.
     4.2. Return sorties will be included in the weekly schedule with estimated take-off and land
     times but will be considered flown as scheduled. To avoid unnecessary deviations, off-
     station/cross-country not returning to Whiteman AFB will not be loaded in the Integrated
     Maintenance Data System (IMDS).
5. Surge rules. Sortie surge operations will be coordinated and approved as part of the
scheduling process. The surge rate will not exceed more than 125% of the War Mission Plan-5
rate.
6. Crew ready aircraft.
     6.1. The Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) expediter/production supervisor will
     notify Maintenance Operations Control (MOC) when aircraft are crew ready and MOC will
     notify the Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
     6.2. The standard crew ready time is 1 hour before scheduled take-off time. Crew show
     times at the aircraft will be 50 minutes before scheduled take off time.
7. Local schedule publishing and input deadlines.
     7.1. In order to de-conflict takeoff and land times, verify proper sortie sequence numbers,
     fuel loads, configuration codes, tail numbers and spares; all weekly schedule inputs are due
     to Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) by close of business on Tuesday.
     7.2. Weekly draft schedule and briefing slides are due to the FW/CC, MXG/CC, OG/CC, no
     later than (NLT) 1200 Thursday.
8. Flying hour accountability.
442FWI 21-165 7 AUGUST 2013                                                                   3


  8.1. Responsibilities.
     8.1.1. The Debriefing Section will be responsible for the completeness of the Air Force
     Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and
     loading the pertinent information into IMDS.
     8.1.2. The 303 FS/Aviation Resource Management (ARM) office is responsible for the
     accuracy of the AFTO Form 781 and auditing such information against the daily IMDS
     report. Once audited, the debriefing section will make changes to IMDS.
  8.2. Procedures.
     8.2.1. Debrief will verify the AFTO Form 781 for completeness and accuracy and will
     document in IMDS. The de-briefer will ensure all blocks on AFTO Form 781 matches
     IMDS. Original AFTO Form 781’s are the responsibility of the pilots and will be turned
     into the ARM office.
     8.2.2. PS&D will post an electronic copy of the Maintenance Scheduling Application
     Tool (MSAT) product or Aircraft Utilization Report (AUR) daily to the mutual folder on
     the local area network (LAN) drive in the 303FS folder and notify both debrief and ARM
     once accomplished. The preferred method will be to use the daily sortie reconciliation
     aspect of MSAT when possible. If not, an AUR will be used. A date/time stamp will be
     provided on the daily reconciliation. If the date time/stamp is after the current flying
     window the daily product will include that days flying hours.
     8.2.3. ARM monitors/Debrief will use the AUR/MSAT product to audit the AFTO Form
     781 for accuracy and completeness. If disparities exist, debrief will coordinate with
     ARM, annotate disparities on the AUR and correct IMDS if required. If an agreement
     cannot be made on the disparity, ARM will coordinate with the Operational Group
     Aerospace Vehicle Utilization Monitor for resolution. Debrief will digitally sign the
     AUR/MSAT product IAW 21-103, and post to the mutual folder on the LAN.
     8.2.4. Signed daily AURs/MSAT products will be maintained by ARM for three months
     IAW AFI 21-103.
     8.2.5. Flying hours will be reconciled every Monday for monthly cumulative
     hours/sorties using the same daily process.
     8.2.6. Debrief will ensure that all hours and sorties are debriefed by the 2nd calendar day
     of the month. PS&D will post the monthly AUR/MSAT product for validation once all
     flying hours and sorties have been debriefed for the previous month.
     8.2.7. Upon closing out the month, the ARM office will forward a signed copy of the
     monthly AUR/MSAT product flying hour verification no later than the 4th calendar day
     of the following month to the Aerospace Vehicle Utilization Manager and PS&D. The
     previous month’s flying hours will be reported and reconciled in IMDS NLT 2400 hours
     on the 4th calendar day of the month.
