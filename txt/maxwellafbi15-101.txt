                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. 42 OSF/AOW, henceforth referred to as Maxwell Weather, is the focal point for all
   weather related issues on Maxwell AFB. Maxwell Weather provides or arranges for routine
   and specialized weather support to the 42d Air Base Wing (ABW) and all tenant
   organizations on Maxell AFB in accordance with this instruction and applicable directives.
   1.1.2. Changes in requirements and support capabilities will be published as changes to this
   instruction. An annual review of this instruction will be conducted by Maxwell Weather.
   Waivers are not authorized.
   1.1.3. According to AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities, an
   Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) will provide resource protection, terminal aerodrome
   forecasts, regional, and operational-level weather products and information, meteorological
   watch (METWATCH), Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), and flight weather briefing support
   for Air Force locations within designated geographic regions. The 26th Operational Weather
   Squadron (OWS) at Barksdale AFB provides this support for Maxwell AFB.
   1.1.4. Maxwell Weather will focus on providing tactical-level weather products and
   information needed for mission execution.
1.2. Maxwell Weather Mission. Maxwell Weather is organized, trained, and equipped to
conduct weather operations in order to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather
information and products to professionally support the 42 ABW and all tenant units on Maxwell
AFB. More specifically, Maxwell Weather will take and disseminate all required surface
weather observations to include all prescribed elements to local customers over the Joint
Environmental Toolkit (JET); collaborate with the 26 OWS in producing and disseminating
weather watches, warnings, and advisories; provide Mission Weather Products (MWP) and flight
weather briefings for local and transient aircrews and conduct MISSIONWATCH for these
forecasts; and act as “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS.
1.3. Assumptions.
   1.3.1. This instruction consolidates weather support capabilities and procedures for
   peacetime operations. It does not cover special or wartime operations. Procedures for
   wartime operations are contained in other applicable documents.
   1.3.2. This instruction constitutes agreements for weather service at the local level;
   therefore, this instruction is published in lieu of Letters of Agreement, Memorandums of
   Agreement (MOA), and Memorandums of Understanding between Maxwell Weather and
   supported organizations.
1.4. Operational Constraints. Maxwell Weather will provide weather information based on
data received from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the 26 OWS and the National
Weather Service (NWS). The extent of Maxwell Weather operational capabilities depends on
the AFWA, 26 OWS, and NWS remaining operational.
 6                                                       MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014


1.5. Shortfalls and Limiting Factors.
     1.5.1. The ability of Maxwell Weather to perform its mission is dependent on the number of
     personnel available and communications outages/failures. During peak hours or severe
     weather conditions, out of office weather briefings may not be possible due to limited
     manning.
     1.5.2. The official point of observation for manual observations is located approximately 20
     feet from the northwest corner of Building 844. The field of view from this location is
     significantly limited due to buildings and trees on base. Specifically, the field of view is
     limited to less than 1/4 mile from 080 – 170 degrees, approximately 1/4 mile from 170 – 230
     degrees, 1/4 mile from 260 – 290 degrees, and 1/4 to 1/2 mile from 300 – 080 degrees. Only
     a small section of the central part of the runway is visible from 230 – 260 degrees. Also,
     high-intensity lights on the flight line significantly limit the ability to accurately determine
     visibility, cloud amounts, and cloud heights at night. The point of observation for automated
     observations is located at the sensor group near the approach end of runway 15. There are no
     limitations at this site.
     1.5.3. Only the approach end of runway 15 has weather sensors. The approach end of
     runway 33 does not; however, data from the 15 end sensors is considered representative for
     non-precision approach landings on the 33 end.
1.6. Maxwell Weather Operating Hours. Weather services are available from 0630 CT to
2200 CT, Monday through Friday and 0930 CT to 1800 CT on weekends. Maxwell Weather
closes on federal holidays, and may close on Air Education and Training Command (AETC)
Family Days. Staff services are available from 0700 CT to 1600 CT, Monday through Friday,
except federal holidays.
1.7. Maxwell Weather Duty Priorities. The Maxwell Weather duty priorities are listed in
Table 1.1., and exist to balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities focus
efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts. Weather
forecasters will use good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially where
there is imminent danger to life and property.

    14     Provide other briefings and forecasts
 NOTE: During JET outages, the forecaster will call local users to pass observations, TAF,
 PIREPs etc, before calling the 26 OWS for longline transmissions.
1.8. Basic Weather Watch. The FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Station is normally
operated in automated mode. When in this mode, it provides a continuous weather watch for the
airfield. When the FMQ-19 is being augmented, the weather forecaster will conduct a Basic
Weather Watch for the airfield.
   1.8.1. Basic Weather Watch (BWW) is a program that has been implemented to establish the
   minimum requirements needed to ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained.
   1.8.2. Because of other weather duties, weather forecasters cannot monitor the weather
   continuously. Due to these other weather duties, weather forecasters may not detect and
   report all weather changes as they occur. As a result, Maxwell Weather will conduct a BWW
   when the FMQ-19 is being augmented.
   1.8.3. During a BWW, weather forecasters will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not
   to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for an
   Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI), when any of the following conditions
   are observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
       1.8.3.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
       1.8.3.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
       1.8.3.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
 8                                                       MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014


        1.8.3.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
        1.8.3.5. Precipitation (any form).
        1.8.3.6. Thunderstorms
        1.8.3.7. Fog or Mist.
        1.8.3.8. All supplemental criteria specified in table 2.1.
        1.8.3.9. During mandatory back-up specified in table 2.1.
        1.8.3.10. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will
        remain alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI
        observation. Weather technicians will also monitor local area observational and forecast
        products as often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of
        responsibility.
1.9. Cooperative Weather Watch.
     1.9.1. To ensure Maxwell Weather disseminates the most accurate surface weather
     observations, the control tower and weather personnel will employ a Cooperative Weather
     Watch.
     1.9.2. Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility different from the prevailing
     surface visibility, reporting of sector visibility, local pilot weather reports (PIREP), and any
     occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be
     critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources. As a minimum, Air
     Traffic Control (ATC) and Maxwell Weather will accomplish the following actions:
        1.9.2.1. ATC will evaluate tower visibility to report changes in tower prevailing
        visibility and sector visibility to Maxwell Weather when tower visibility is less than 4
        statute miles and is different from the surface prevailing visibility and reported sector
        visibility.
        1.9.2.2. Weather forecasters will reevaluate weather conditions whenever a reliable
        source (i.e., ATC, pilots, local law enforcement, etc.) reports weather conditions different
        from the last disseminated observation (e.g., different ceiling height, visibility, present
        weather). Based on reevaluation of the different weather conditions reported, weather
        forecasters will:
            1.9.2.2.1. Generate a special observation (SPECI) if the different conditions warrant
            immediate dissemination.
            1.9.2.2.2. Include the differing conditions in the next required Meteorological
            Aviation Report (METAR) or SPECI observation if the conditions alone do not
            warrant immediate dissemination.
     1.9.3. ATC Personnel Actions. ATC directives (i.e., AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations
     Procedures and Programs; FAA Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control) require certified control
     tower personnel to make tower prevailing and sector visibility observations when the
     prevailing visibility at the usual point of observation, or at the tower level, is less than 4
     miles. Control tower personnel certified to take visibility observations will do the following:
MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014                                                                 9


      1.9.3.1. Notify the weather unit when they observe tower prevailing visibility to decrease
      to less than, or increase to equal or exceed 4 miles.
      1.9.3.2. When the prevailing visibility at the tower or the surface is less than 4 miles,
      report all changes of one or more reportable values to the weather unit.
      1.9.3.3. As required by FAA Order 7110.65, use the lower of either the tower or surface
      visibility as the prevailing visibility for aircraft operations.
      1.9.3.4. Relay all PIREPs to the Maxwell Weather forecaster not later than 5 minutes
      after receipt.
   1.9.4. When in manual observation mode, Maxwell Weather Personnel will:
      1.9.4.1. Notify the tower as soon as possible whenever the prevailing visibility at the
      observation point decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceed 4 miles.
      1.9.4.2. Re-evaluate surface prevailing or sector visibility, as soon as practicable, upon
      initial receipt of a differing control tower value, and upon receipt of subsequent
      reportable changes at the control tower level.
      1.9.4.3. Use control tower values of prevailing or sector visibility as a guide in
      determining the surface visibility when the view of portions of the horizon is obstructed
      by buildings, aircraft, etc. The presence of a surface-based obscuration, uniformly
      distributed to heights above the level of the tower, is sufficient reason to consider the
      weather unit's prevailing visibility to be the same as the control tower level.
1.10. Disseminating Weather Products.
   1.10.1. JET is the primary dissemination system for surface weather observations, terminal
   aerodrome forecasts, weather watches, weather warnings, weather advisories, and pilot
   reports on Maxwell AFB. All agencies on Maxell AFB requiring this data on a consistent
   basis will request a JET user account from Maxwell Weather and monitor JET online when it
   is needed.
   1.10.2. When JET is not working, Maxwell Weather will disseminate products via phone or
   email, using the following priority: Maxwell Tower, Maxwell Command Post (during flying
   operations), airfield management operations, and OTS/OCC.

   2.1.24. Assume responsibilities when Maxwell Weather evacuates. Maxwell Weather will
   relocate to the Alternate Operating Location (AOL) located in bldg. 1050, the operations the
   357th Airlift Squadron. The 26 OWS will assume responsibilities during the interim period
   until Maxwell Weather can resume operations. The phone number at the AOL is 953-4499.
   There are no limitations at this location.
   2.1.25. 26 OWS Interruptions of Service.
      2.1.25.1. Interruptions Less than 72 Hours. When the interruption in weather operations
      at the 26 OWS is expected to be 72 hours or less, responsibility for local TAF, weather
      WWAs, and transient flight briefings will transfer to Maxwell Weather. The 26 OWS
      graphics production/amendment capabilities will be provided by another CONUS OWS.
      2.1.25.2. Interruptions More than 72 Hours. For an outage lasting more than 72 hours,
      the 26 OWS will deploy personnel to AFWA (or another OWS) and reclaim the original
      support provided to Maxwell Weather from a backup location.
2.2. Maxwell Weather. Maxwell Weather will:
   2.2.1. Coordinate requests for briefing support with the 26 OWS on larger operations when
   Maxwell Weather cannot provide exploitation products to Maxwell AFB due to manning
   levels.
   2.2.2. Provide flight weather briefings to Civil Air Patrol members, during normal duty
   hours, performing official Air Force operational duties. Civil Air Patrol members performing
   official flight duties outside of normal operating hours should be advised of remote briefing
   capabilities (i.e., through the 26 OWS). Maxwell Weather will not have personnel on duty
   solely to provide briefings for Civil Air Patrol activities.
   2.2.3. Provide service IAW posted duty priorities for walk-in requests from transient
   aircrews. When transient or staged aircrews request briefing support, Maxwell Weather will:
      2.2.3.1. Provide a briefing or update an existing briefing form as time and resources
      allow. EXCEPTION: Refer flight weather briefing requests for AMC, USAFE, and
      PACAF integrated flight-management (IFM) missions to the appropriate IFM weather
      support agency (e.g. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW, 21 OWS, and 17 OWS respectively).
      Maxwell Weather may provide access to meteorological satellite imagery, take off data,
      and other perishable weather data for IFM crews upon request, but will refer the aircrew
      to their supporting IFM weather organization for weather updates to the actual mission
      package.
      2.2.3.2. If unable to provide a briefing or update an existing briefing, provide contact
      information for the 26 OWS and direct the aircrew to Airfield Operations-provided
      terminals for online access to weather support. Assist aircrew as time permits.
   2.2.4. Relay pertinent information to the 26 OWS concerning changing local conditions that
   significantly diverge from forecasted conditions, especially affecting resource protection or
   the TAF.
MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014                                                               13


  2.2.5. Incorporate the MIRF and RIRF managed by the 26 OWS into qualification and
  continuation training. Maxwell Weather will contribute pertinent METSAT imagery or radar
  signatures that may be of training value to the 26 OWS for consideration for inclusion into
  the MIRF/RIRF.
  2.2.6. Identify local or fine scale influences on weather parameters yielding empirical
  evidence that may support establishment of a rule of thumb (ROT) for Maxwell AFB. These
  will be identified as observed and passed on to the 26 OWS for validation. The Maxwell
  Weather role will not exceed gathering and furnishing of information.
  2.2.7. Conduct seasonal continuation training, at least quarterly, concentrating on
  environmental threats to operations associated with the upcoming season. Training should
  focus on environmental sensitivity thresholds pertinent to DoD full-spectrum operations
  including, but not limited to, supported weapons systems, platforms, mission profiles, and
  ORM processes. Maxwell Weather will leverage seasonal training material from the 26
  OWS.
  2.2.8. To ensure the most current forecast reference materials (FRM) are on file, Maxwell
  Weather will forward newly created or updated documents to the 26 OWS.
  2.2.9. Forward Rules of Thumb (ROTs) to the 26 OWS for validation and documentation of
  forecast effectiveness. ROTs under development will be designated as experimental‖ in local
  procedures and OWS-maintained FRMs until validated.
  2.2.10. Review installation data pages within 90 days of assignment or annually, whichever
  occurs first; to ensure consistency with supported unit requirements. Updated/reviewed
  installation data pages will have the date of review or updated publication date published on
  the document. Maxwell Weather leadership will inform the 26 OWS of any changes that
  occur on the installation to update the installation data page. Any support issue between the
  26 OWS and Maxwell Weather that cannot be resolved at the appropriate subordinate levels
  through the chain of command will be elevated to the functional higher headquarters for
  resolution.
  2.2.11. Provide feedback to the 26 OWS on the accuracy, timeliness and relevance of
  weather products and information. Route reports of unsatisfactory products or services at the
  lowest levels of operations. Forward all unresolved issues to the 26 OWS Operations
  Superintendent and/or Director of Operations through the 26 OWS similar chain of command
  (Operations Superintendent/Director of Operations, etc.).
  2.2.12. Coordinate weather support for their supported organizations during their hours of
  closure far enough in advance with the 26 OWS to ensure proper hand off of support.
  Maxwell Weather will notify the 26 OWS upon closing of operations and verify finalization
  of support arrangements including flight weather briefings.
  2.2.13. Notify the 26 OWS when resuming operations at the beginning of their operational
  duty day. Will use this contact to gain environmental situational awareness of current and
  forecast conditions, discuss any active/imminent resource protection products and receive
  handover of flight briefing responsibility.
  2.2.14. Forward updated changes in documented support to the 26 OWS, as required. If
  these updates drive further changes to Maxwell Weather-26 OWS operations, prior
14                                                  MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014


  coordination between Maxwell Weather-26 OWS leadership is mandatory. Agreed upon
  changes will be documented on the installation data page.
  2.2.15. Notify the 26 OWS Operations Superintendent or regional zone OIC when temporary
  changes to duty hours occur (e.g., Family Day, Goal Day, other closures/extensions). This
  notification will be made no later than 24 hours in advance of the closure to allow the 26
  OWS to reallocate its resources, as required.
  2.2.16. Review the FRM (Forecast Reference Material) for the installation hosted
  electronically by the 26 OWS at least annually. Provide updates (e.g., new airfield weather
  sensors, local mission types) to allow the 26 OWS to update the installation’s electronic
  FRM, as required.
  2.2.17. Notify the 26 OWS when moving to the AOL. Provide the 26 OWS temporary
  telephone numbers and any changes in the weather warning and advisory notification
  procedures.
  2.2.18. Limit analysis efforts to mission-scale effects along mission routes and operating
  areas (e.g. terrain influences) to refine characterization products provided by the 26 OWS.
  Maxwell Weather will not re-characterize the environment at hemispheric or synoptic scales.
     2.2.18.1. Use 26 OWS-issued graphical and alphanumeric analysis and forecast products,
     TAFs, Watches, Warnings (WW), and Forecast Weather Advisories (FWA) in
     developing the MWP, as well as for updating supported unit(s) decision-makers on
     environmental impacts to operations.
     2.2.18.2. Discuss potential changes to characterization products with the 26 OWS when
     significant disagreements exist or the need to amend products or issue warnings that have
     not been issued or amended. The 26 OWS will have final issue authority.
     2.2.18.3. Alert the 26 OWS to developing situations not coded in meteorological reports
     that potentially drive amendments to forecast products from the 26 OWS or impact flight
     safety.
  2.2.19. Ensure operating procedures include timeline requirements (e.g., Air Traffic
  Control/Supervisors of Flying will relay pilot report information to weather not later than 5
  minutes after receipt) and requirements for relaying all PIREPS to the 26 OWS.
  2.2.20. Fully utilize and do not deviate from the tropical cyclone information provided by
  the 26 OWS (i.e., Tropical Cyclone-Threat Analysis Product (TC-TAP)) derived from
  National Hurricane Center products.
  2.2.21. Work with CEX to ensure transport models are configured to automatically pull
  observed or forecast gridded model data when possible. Provide a region-specific model data
  recommendation consistent with the 26 OWS model.
  2.2.22. Upon request from Disaster Preparedness or any other agency, obtain/provide CDMs
  from the 26 OWS.
  2.2.23. Coordinate weather watch and warning criteria, as well as tropical cyclone forecasts,
  to include the Desired Lead Times and notification methods with the 26 OWS.
  2.2.24. Issue weather warnings when imminent weather conditions pose a hazard to life and
  property, and time of onset does not allow collaboration with the 26 OWS. Contact the 26
MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014                                                                15


   OWS as soon as possible after local dissemination to ensure warning information is entered
   into their warning tracking and verification system and that expanded METWATCH is
   assumed by the 26 OWS.
   2.2.25. Coordinate forecast weather advisory requirements with the 26 OWS and document
   the requirement on the installation data page. The desired lead time based upon Maxwell
   AFB requirements and the 26 OWS capability to provide such advance notice.
   2.2.26. Develop procedures to provide appropriate information to the Maxwell Command
   Post IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting (OPREP) and Maxwell AFB policies.
   Maxwell Weather will ensure the 26 OWS and AETC Weather are aware of the reported
   weather event as soon as practical.
   2.2.27. Relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in coded
   meteorological reports to the 26 OWS to assist in characterization operations as part of the
   Eyes Forward function.
   2.2.28. Notify the 26 OWS Operations Floor Production Supervisor of all aircraft mishaps as
   soon as possible after notification of the event. Note: Expedient notification is critical to
   archiving data pertinent to the mishap.
2.3. The 26 OWS and Maxwell Weather together will:
   2.3.1. Ensure the timely issuance of WWAs with supported customers.
   2.3.2. Establish procedures to manage severe weather threats, to include recalling of weather
   personnel.
   2.3.3. The 26 OWS will determine mandatory forecast review criteria of severe weather
   events as required. Maxwell Weather may request reviews for severe weather events that
   negatively influence the effective execution of military operations. The 26 OWS is the
   primary OPR for the formal review, and Maxwell Weather will provide inputs and
   coordination, as required.
   2.3.4. Assist the installation commander and disaster preparedness personnel providing
   technical material and/or developing presentations to educate installation agencies on the

                                          Chapter 3

                                  SERVICES PROVIDED

3.1. Surface Weather Observation.
   3.1.1. All surface weather observations will be disseminated over the Joint Environmental
   Toolkit (JET) and will include the time of the observation, wind direction and speed,
   visibility, present weather, sky condition, temperature in Celsius, dew point in Celsius,
   altimeter setting, and remarks. An instantaneous reading of the Runway Visual Range
   (RVR) will be included when visibility is one mile or less or RVR is 6,000 feet or less.
   Surface observation format is listed in Attachment 5.
   3.1.2. Special observations will be disseminated whenever criteria listed in Attachment 2
   occur.
   3.1.3. FMQ-19 Augmentation. The FMQ-19 will normally be operated in auto mode.
   However, there are times when data from the FMQ-19 will need to be augmented.
   Augmentation is the process of manually adding or editing data in an observation generated
   by the FMQ-19. The two augmentation processes used are supplementing and back-up.
   Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an automated
   observation that is beyond the capabilities of the FMQ-19 to detect and/or report. Back-up is
   the method of manually providing meteorological data and/or dissemination to the FMQ-19
   observation when the primary automated method is not operational or unavailable due to
   sensor and/or communication failure.
      3.1.3.1. Maxwell Weather will use manual observing methods (e.g., prevailing visibility
      reporting, thunderstorm reporting) when supplementing or backing up the FMQ-19. Only
      elements in Table 2.1 will be supplemented. Only the specific observation elements that
      are missing or incorrect due to sensor and/or communication failure will be backed up.
      For example, if the visibility sensor is malfunctioning, only visibility will be backed up.
      All other elements in the observation will be used as reported from the FMQ-19.
      3.1.3.2. Any data used to supplement or back up an observation will have been evaluated
      within 15 minutes of the actual time of the report. Data older than will 15 minutes will
      not be used in an observation.
      3.1.3.3. In order to properly supplement and back up the FMQ-19, the weather forecaster
      on duty will maintain situational awareness of current weather conditions and the FMQ-
      19 observations at all times.
      3.1.3.4. Supplementing. The weather forecaster on duty will supplement observations
      when the airfield is open and the weather conditions in Table 2.1. are observed. Also, the
      forecaster will perform a Basic Weather Watch from the manual observing point of
      observation and be ready to supplement/back-up observations if the conditions in Table
      3.1. are forecast to occur within 1 hour.
      3.1.3.5. Back-up. Except for some automated remarks, back-up refers to the weather
      forecaster providing the same reporting capability as that provided by the FMQ-19. The
      on-duty forecaster will back-up the FMQ-19 if the system/sensor(s) is/are not operational
      or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure. There is no requirement to
 20                                                                      MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014


           back-up the system/sensor when the airfield is closed unless tornadic activity is occurring
           or forecast to occur. Weather technicians will provide back-up information in accordance
           with Table 3.2 Summary of Back-up encoding, and Table 3.3, Summary of Back-up
           Remarks in AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.
           3.1.3.6. When using backup wind and pressure equipment, values will be estimated.

Table 3.1. Mandatory Supplementary/Back-Up Weather Conditions
Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Body of Report

1. Tornado (+FC)

2. Funnel Cloud (FC)

3. Hail (GR) ≥ ½ inch

4. Volcanic Ash (VA)

5. Ice Pellets (PL)

Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Remarks Section

1. Tornadic Activity

2. Snow depth (only during airfield operating hours)

Mandatory Back-Up Weather Conditions

1. Thunderstorms (within 5NM of Maxwell AFB)4

2. Ceiling/Visibility below 1500ft/3 miles4

3. Freezing precipitation, any type5

4. Snow5

5. Freezing fog5

NOTES:

1. The immediate reporting of +FC or FC takes precedent over any other phenomena.

2. The forecaster will log on to the FMQ-19 and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity anytime a weather watch or
warning is issued for tornadoes.

3. Data augmented in an observation must have been evaluated within 15 minutes of the actual time of the report.

4. At times the FMQ-19 automated observations have been unrepresentative when these conditions occur. These
unrepresentative observations have caused mission delays and cancelations when aircraft were doing visual approaches and
assault strip landings. Indicated items will be backed up when flying operations are occurring.

5. Due to a deficiency in the FMQ-19 - incorrectly reporting freezing precipitation during snow or freezing fog events.
MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014                                                                  21


3.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
   3.2.1. TAFs provide meteorological information in a standard text format containing the
   cloud cover, cloud heights, and visibility for general flight rule conditions, as well as wind,
   altimeter, and other weather parameters needed to sustain the landing and takeoff of aircraft.
   3.2.2. 26 OWS issues the official TAF for Maxwell AFB in collaboration with Maxwell
   Weather.
   3.2.3. TAFs will be issued at 0615L and 1415L when the airfield is open, and will be valid
   for a 30 hour period. See Attachment 5 for code breakdown.
   3.2.4. Unless otherwise specified, forecast elements in the main body of the forecast text
   apply to the area within a 5 nautical mile radius of the center of Maxwell airfield complex.
   3.2.5. 26 OWS and Maxwell Weather will ensure forecasts indicate when conditions cross
   specification criteria, are representative of current and expected weather conditions, and
   remain within standard amendment criteria. TAFs will be amended and disseminated
   whenever thresholds in Attachment 3 are crossed and are not reflected in the current TAF.
   Amendments will cover the remaining time in the original 24 hour TAF.
   3.2.6. The following remark will be appended to the 1400L TAF IAW AFMAN 15-124,
   Meteorological Codes: “LAST NO AMDS AFT YYGG NEXT YYGG” where AFT
   YYGG is the day and time (Z) when the airfield is closed and a TAF is no longer required
   and NEXT YYGG is the time when the new TAF is required. For example, “LAST NO
   AMDS AFT 2004 NEXT 2212” means the TAF will not be amended after 04Z on the 20th
   and the next TAF is scheduled for 12Z on the 22nd day of the month.
3.3. 357th Airlift Squadron Mission Weather Product (MWP).
   3.3.1. Maxwell Weather will provide the 357th AS MWP (see Figure 3.1.) for each local
   mission departing and landing at Maxwell AFB. The MWP will be produced keeping
   mission critical thresholds for the 357th AS (see Attachment 6) in mind.
   3.3.2. The 357th AS MWP will be prepared and faxed to or printed on the printer of the 357th
   operations desk no later than 3 ½ hours prior to the first scheduled take off. It will be valid
   for the local flying window for the day, and it will only be prepared when there are local
   missions scheduled for the day.
   3.3.3. The MWP will be amended anytime the criteria in attachment 4 are met.
   Additionally, verbal updates will be given to the 357th AS Duty Officer/NCO whenever
   other changes to the MWP occur, e.g., weather warnings, weather watches, weather
   advisories, enroute hazards, changes to dropzone weather, and alternate airfield conditions.
   Amendments will be disseminated by fax or printed on the 357th AS printer.
   3.3.4. Maxwell Weather will not produce a MWP that crosses operational thresholds without
   first coordinating with the 26 OWS unless it is critical to flying safety or when weather
   conditions are rapidly changing and prior coordination is not possible. MWPs will, unless
   otherwise directed, be provided by Maxwell Weather.
   3.3.5. The MWP will include the following weather information: Maxwell AFB forecast;
   Maxwell AFB watches, warnings, and advisories; enroute weather; forecast for Buzz
   dropzone; solar/lunar data; space weather; and weather for alternate airfields. Buzz dropzone
 22                                                 MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014


   is located 14 miles due west of the Maxwell airfield (32°22’50”N 86°36’05”W elevation 126
   feet).

Figure 3.1. 357 AS MWP Example.




3.4. Flight Weather Briefings.
   3.4.1. Flight weather briefings will be prepared using a DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather
   Briefing. Pilots may request verbal briefings instead of a flight weather briefing form.
   Verbal briefings will be logged on a Maxwell AFB Form 27, Aircrew Briefing Log.
   Information on the DD Form 175-1 can be found in Attachment 8 of AFMAN 15-129, Air
   and Space Weather Operations – Processes and Procedures.
   3.4.2. Maxwell Weather will provide flight weather briefings to aircrews assigned to
   Maxwell AFB, i.e., the 357 AS and CAP-USAF. For Maxwell aircrews that are off-station,
   Maxwell Weather will make arrangements to provide briefings remotely (i.e. via phone, fax,
   web, or email) or arrange with other Air Force weather units or Operational Weather
   Squadrons to provide the crews with weather support.
MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014                                                               23


   3.4.3. Maxwell Weather will provide flight weather briefings to transient aircrews as local
   mission and manning dictate. Transient aircrews will be directed to the 26 OWS when
   Maxwell Weather is unable to provide MWPs due to time constraints.
   3.4.4. 26 OWS will employ a web-based capability to provide remote flight weather
   briefings. Sections of the web page will be dedicated to presenting weather products for
   aircrews in the course of a telephone-based briefing with visual aids designed to enhance
   briefing effectiveness. The web page will also allow aircrews to make on-line, advanced
   requests for briefings.
   3.4.5. To ensure 26 OWS has adequate time to examine the weather conditions and complete
   the required documentation, aircrews will need to request routine briefings at least 2 hours
   prior to brief time. Aircrews are encouraged to request routine briefings via the 26 OWS
   web page. If the web page is not working, briefings can be requested via telephone at DSN
   331-2651 or commercial 318-529-2651 (ONLY if DSN is not available), toll free 1-866-223-
   9328 or via fax at DSN 331-2609. Note: The toll free number above is reserved for aircrews
   at civilian facilities without access to DSN phone communications.
   3.4.6. No-notice and short-notice requests (less than 2-hour notice) for flight weather
   briefings will be accomplished as quickly as possible by 26 OWS depending on the current
   workload, available manpower, and duty priorities. No-notice briefing requests will be
   prioritized behind existing requests unless special circumstances warrant a higher priority
   (e.g., alert, search and rescue, medical evacuation, distinguished visitor.)
   3.4.7. 26 OWS will document routine flight weather briefings using the appropriate briefing
   form (e.g., DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing) or electronic equivalent. The briefing
   form will be forwarded to the aircrew by whatever means is most appropriate and feasible
   (e.g., fax, e-mail, 26 OWS web page).
   3.4.8. 26 OWS will document verbal flight weather briefings using the 26 OWS Verbal
   Flight Weather Briefing Log.
   3.4.9. MISSIONWATCH will be performed for all MWPs and flight weather briefings
   provided by Maxwell Weather. Whenever unforecasted changes occur, or are expected to
   occur, Maxwell Weather will notify the pilot through the 357th AS Duty Officer/NCO, ATC,
   airfield management operations, or the Maxwell Command Post if possible.
3.5. Pilot-to-Metro-Service (PMSV).
   3.5.1. Maxwell Weather provides PMSV radio support during hours of operation using
   frequency 342.3 MHz. There are no known limitations for this radio/frequency.
   3.5.2. PMSV support is not available locally during times when Maxwell Weather is closed.
   However, the 26 OWS provides support by phone patch 24 hours a day/7 days a week at
   DSN 331-2651/2652/2653.
   3.5.3. Information from PMSV contacts will be logged on an Maxwell AFB Form 28, Pilot –
   to-Metro-Service Log. See Figure 3.2 for an example.
 24                                                 MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014


Figure 3.2. Maxwell AFB Form 28, Pilot-to-Metro-Service Log, Example.




   3.5.4. Outage procedures.
       3.5.4.1. If the PMSV is inoperative, the tower (ATC) will be notified and they will
       monitor the frequency, and the radio will be logged out with job control.
       3.5.4.2. For long-term outages (more than 1 hour), a NOTAM will be transmitted with
       information about the outage including the expected length, if known, i.e., “PMSV 342.3
       unavailable until approximately 24/1800Z. Tower monitoring freq 342.3.”
       3.5.4.3. When the equipment becomes operational, the tower will be notified and the
       radio will be logged back in with job control. Also, if a NOTAM was transmitted
       reporting the PMSV as being down, base operations will transmit a NOTAM reporting
       that the PMSV frequency is back in operation.
3.6. Pilot Reports (PIREP).
   3.6.1. Aircrews are highly encouraged to provide PIREPs during PMSV contacts.
   3.6.2. All PIREPS will be disseminated over the JET. See Attachment 5 for format.
   3.6.3. Maxwell Tower will relay all PIREPS they receive to Maxwell Weather within 5
   minutes of receipt.

   Maxwell AFB on an Excel® spreadsheet, post it on their web site, and email it to
   organizations that require it.
   3.13.2. Units may request climatological information for Maxwell AFB and other areas of
   interest.    Data can be compiled for deployments, construction projects, runway
   repair/cleaning, heating and cooling-degree days, and other uses. Requests should be made
   with as much lead-time as possible so Maxwell Weather can compile data or obtain it from
   the 14th Weather Squadron. Maxwell Weather may be consulted on uses and benefits of
   climatological data.
3.14. Major Accident/Natural Disaster/Nuclear Fallout Support. Under normal operating
conditions, Maxwell Weather will assist base agencies responding to major accidents and natural
disasters. During communication outages, equipment outages, personnel shortfalls, and when
Maxwell Weather is evacuated, the level of support may be degraded.
   3.14.1. Major Accident Support. This category includes all aircraft accidents and ground
   mishaps. Weather data and forecasts will be provided to the EOC and other base agencies as
   requested.
   3.14.2. Natural Disasters. Maxwell Weather will provide weather support for natural
   disasters IAW procedures outlined in 42 ABW Plan 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency
   Management Plan (CEMP), and the Quick Reaction Checklists (QRC). Maxwell Weather
   will be the single point of contact for coordinating weather information from the National
   Weather Service and National Hurricane Center.
   3.14.3. Hurricanes.
       3.14.3.1. 26 OWS will use the tracks and wind forecasts from the National Hurricane
       Center (NHC) tropical cyclone bulletins when developing the TAFs, warnings, watches,
       and advisories for Maxwell AFB. No deviation from these official forecast tracks is
       authorized, however, modifications to the local wind forecast may be necessary due to
       terrain effects.
       3.14.3.2. 26 OWS will serve as the liaison between the NHC and Maxwell Weather.
       3.14.3.3. Maxwell Weather will translate the official tropical cyclone forecast and 26
       OWS forecasts into a specific mission forecast for Maxwell AFB.

       3.14.3.4. When tropical cyclones are forecasted to affect the southeastern United States
       or the Gulf Coast, Maxwell Weather will notify the Maxwell Command Post.
       3.14.3.5. If the EOC forms, Maxwell Weather will provide briefings that include, as a
       minimum, the storm's current and forecast positions.
       3.14.3.6. If winds of 50 knots or greater, associated with a hurricane or tropical storm,
       are expected at Maxwell AFB, Maxwell Weather will assist the wing commander in
       determining times to go into Hurricane Conditions (HURCON) and Recovery Phase.
       3.14.3.7. 26 OWS and Maxwell Weather will monitor weather conditions and issue
       watches, warnings, and advisories for other hurricane related hazards if they are
       occurring or expected to occur including tornados, strong winds, thunderstorms and
       lightning, cross winds, and heavy precipitation.

                WEATHER WARNINGS, WATCHES, AND ADVISORIES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. The term meteorological watch (METWATCH) is used to describe the process of
   monitoring observed and forecasted weather conditions and notifying selected agencies when
   pre-established weather conditions occur, or are expected to occur.
   4.1.2. The 26 OWS, in collaboration with Maxwell Weather, will perform METWATCH
   duties for Maxwell AFB.
   4.1.3. Warnings and advisories will be issued as either forecasted or observed. Forecasted
   products will have a valid time. Observed products will be valid from the time issued until
   further notice, i.e., until the phenomena is no longer occurring.
   4.1.4. Normally the 26 OWS will issue all forecasted METWATCH products and Maxwell
   Weather will issue observed METWATCH products when they are open. The 26 OWS will
   issue observed METWATCH products when Maxwell Weather is closed.
   4.1.5. Maxwell Weather may issue or supersede a 26 OWS-issued weather warning, watch,
   or advisory only when imminent weather conditions pose a hazard to life or property and
   prior coordination with the 26 OWS is not practical or communications do not allow. Under
   these conditions, Maxwell Weather will be responsible for local dissemination and contact
   the 26 OWS as soon as possible afterward so they can assume responsibility/accountability.
   4.1.6. Desired lead time is the minimum amount of advanced notice an agency requires in
   order to take specific actions prior to the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
4.2. Definitions
   4.2.1. Weather Watch. A weather watch is a special notice to notify operational
   commanders of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard
   to life or property. Weather Watches indicate a potential for environmental threats and are
   used by operational commanders to make force protection and risk management decisions.
   4.2.2. Weather Warning. A weather warning is a special notice to notify operational
   commanders when an established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to
   life or property is occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise
   information outlining environmental threats and are used by operational commanders to
   make force protection decisions.
   4.2.3. Weather Advisory. A weather advisory is a special product notifying an end user
   when an established environmental condition affecting operations is occurring or is expected
   to occur.
4.3. Responsibilities.
   4.3.1. The 26 OWS will perform the OWS responsibilities stated in AFI 15-128, Air Force
   Weather Roles and Responsibilities, and AFMAN 15-129 V1, Air and Space Weather
   Operations – Characterization, as supplemented. Additionally, the 26 OWS will:
       4.3.1.1. Perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for Maxwell AFB.
MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014                                                                    31


       4.3.1.2. Issue all watches, forecast weather warnings, and forecast weather advisories.
       4.3.1.3. Issue all observed warnings and advisories when Maxwell Weather is closed.
   4.3.2. Maxwell Weather will perform duties IAW AFI 15-129 and the                    contract.
   Additionally, Maxwell Weather will:
       4.3.2.1. Issue all observed warnings and advisories when the airfield is open.
       4.3.2.2. Notify the 26 OWS after issuing, modifying, or canceling all observed warnings
       and advisories for Maxwell AFB.
       4.3.2.3. Convey all weather watches, warnings, and advisories verbatim to base
       customers. No local modification and or supplementation is allowed on 26 OWS issued
       weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
4.4. Disseminating Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories.
   4.4.1. The JET is the primary dissemination system for weather watches, warnings, and
   advisories on Maxwell AFB. All watches, warnings, and advisories will be disseminated via
   the JET. See Attachment 5 for format and examples.
   4.4.2. The 26 OWS will place a courtesy call, normally via the Integrated Weather Warning
   Capability (IWWC), to the Maxwell Command Post whenever they issue a watch, warning,
   or advisory. The command post will disseminate the products to Maxell AFB organizations
   IAW Attachment 7.
   4.4.3. Weather watches, warnings, and advisories will be identified numerically by month
   and sequential number of the product issued. For example, a weather warning number of
   "09-002" indicates the second warning (002) issued for the month of September (09).
   Sequential numbers for watches, warnings, and advisories increment independent of one
   another. The text of a weather watch, warning, or advisory will be worded so that all
   recipients may easily understand it.
   4.4.4. During normal duty hours (0700-1600), Maxwell Weather will send base-wide emails
   to notify personnel of tornado, damaging winds (≥ 50 knots) large hail (≥ ¾ inch), and heavy
   rain watches and warnings to ensure maximum dissemination. Base-wide emails will also be
   sent when these watches and warnings are terminated.
4.5. Weather Watches. Weather watches are issued IAW AFMAN 15-129 V1. 26 OWS will
issue a weather watch for within 5 nm of the center of the Maxwell AFB runway complex to
include within 5 nm of Gunter Annex, except as specified, when the potential for the criteria
defined in Table 4.1 exists.

       member(s) according to the following guidance:
           4.12.2.1.1. During weekday normal duty hours the duty forecaster will implement
           SWAP by notifying the Maxwell Weather manager and/or the SWAP standby
           member in the office or by phone whenever one or more conditions in Table 3.12 are
           met. It is likely that the above personnel are present in the weather office and do not
           need to be recalled/activated.
           4.12.2.1.2. During weekend normal duty hours the duty forecaster will implement
           SWAP by notifying the standby member by phone whenever one or more conditions
           in Table 3.12 are met.
       4.12.2.2. Standby/Recall.
           4.12.2.2.1. During Maxwell Weather non-duty hours, the 26 OWS will notify the
           Maxwell Command Post at DSN 493-7474 of any Watch, Warning, or Advisory
           issued during METWATCH of the Maxell AFB operations area.
           4.12.2.2.2. The weather manager will receive watches, warnings, and advisories by
           email from IWWC.
           4.12.2.2.3. The weather manager and/or the SWAP standby member will analyze
           current atmospheric conditions and discuss the forecast with the 26 OWS
           Forecaster/Regional Weather Supervisor.
           4.12.2.2.4. The SWAP will be activated whenever one or more of the warnings in
           Table 4.12 are issued.

that provides primary Terminal Airdrome Forecasts, Weather Watches and forecasted Warnings
and Advisories. The 26 OWS is the central forecasting facility for South-eastern CONUS
weather operations.
Aircraft Mishap— Term used to denote any event resulting in damage to, or destruction of any
aircraft to include lightning strikes, inadvertent departure from the paved runway or taxiway
surface, aircraft or Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) fires, and forced landings due to in-
flight emergencies.
Amendment (AMD)— Used as a message modifier when transmitting an aerodrome forecast
amendment.
Augmentation— Augmentation is the process of manually adding or editing data in an
observation generated by the FMQ-19 by either supplementing (adding) or back-up (editing).
MAXWELLAFBI15-101 20 MAY 2014                                                                   47


Basic Weather Watch (BWW)— A BWW is normally conducted by Maxwell Weather when
the FMQ-19 is in augmentented or manual mode because they cannot monitor the atmospheric
conditions continuously due to other weather duties. During a BWW, weather forecasters will
recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last
observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI observation.
Climatology— The historical records of weather conditions measured or observed at a specific
location. Some data go back over 100 years, but generally, a 10- to 25-history is more common.
Climatology is useful in planning operations beyond 5 to 7 days. It usually describes the average
(or mean) conditions such as average high and low temperatures and extremes.
Cooperative Weather Watch— Air Traffic Control personnel notify the forecaster of
significant changes from reported conditions, as duty priorities permit.
Desired Lead-time (DLT)— The amount of advance notice a supported agency desires before
the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
Eyes Forward— Maxwell Weather forecasters are the eyes forward for the forecasters in the
Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) and integrate weather radar data, meteorological satellite
imagery, lightning detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems (vertical profilers,
mesonet data, etc.) to create an integrated weather picture and near-term trend forecasts for the
OWS.
Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA)— A weather advisory issued when the customer requires
advance notification of an impending weather condition with sufficient time to allow for
protective actions.
Integrated Weather Warning Capability (IWWC)— Automated system used by the 26 OWS
to automatically disseminate weather watches, warnings, and advisories over the JET, by phone,
and over their web page.
Issue Time— The time when an agency is notified of a watch, warning, or advisory. When
more than one agency is notified, the issue time is the time the last agency is notified. Follow-up
notifications are not considered when determining issue time.
Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)— JET is a web based weather dissemination system.
Products available for users on JET include weather warnings, weather watches, weather
advisories, live sensor data, surface weather observations, and terminal aerodrome forecasts. All
data is site-specific for Maxwell AFB and Gunter Annex. Use of JET requires a username and
password which can be provided by Maxwell Weather.
Lightning Notification System (LNS)— A system of telephonically activated alarm lights to
alert base agencies of lightning warnings.
Limited Weather Observation— The limited weather observation is a surface weather
observation taken by certified non-weather personnel. Units that take limited weather
observations must relay these to Maxwell Weather in support of the Cooperative Weather Watch
program.
Maxwell Weather— The weather facility and or weather personnel located in Bldg 844,
Maxwell AFB AL. Maxwell Weather provides direct operational support at the tactical/base
level.

METAR Observation— Meteorological Aviation Report. A routine, hourly surface weather
observation. It contains a report of wind, visibility, runway visual range, present weather, sky
condition, temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting. In addition, significant remarks are
appended to the METAR observation.
METWATCH— Monitoring aerospace weather for a route, area, or terminal and advising
concerned organizations when phenomena that could affect their operations or pose a hazard to
life or property are occurring or about to occur.
Mission Weather Product (MWP)— Any weather product or group of weather products
generated by Maxwell Weather that is integrated into the military decision making process.
MWPs may be planning or execution products and are not limited to aviation missions.
MISSIONWATCH— The monitoring of aerospace weather for a specific mission (i.e., ground,
air, or space) and informing supported agencies when unforecast mission-limiting phenomena
could impact operations.
Observed Weather Advisory (OWA)— A weather advisory issued when a particular weather
event first occurs and the customer does not require advanced notification of the observed
weather phenomena.
Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)— An organization comprised of management,
technician, and training personnel responsible for providing regional weather support. Their
mission is to produce theater-scale tailored weather forecast products and services to customers
within their area of responsibility.
Pilot Report (PIREP)— A report of in-flight weather provided by an aircrew member.
Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV)— A radio system with dedicated frequency (342.3 MHz) for
contact between airborne pilots and weather facilities.
Severe Weather— Any weather condition that poses a hazard to property or life.
SPECI Observation— An unscheduled observation taken when significant changes in weather
elements meet special criteria. All SPECIs shall be made as soon as possible after the relevant
criteria are observed.
Surface Weather Observation— An evaluation of one or more meteorological elements that
describe the state of the atmosphere at the location where the observation is taken. Observations
are taken in accordance with AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, and disseminated
locally and via longline communications circuits during hours of operation.
Telephone Alert System (TAS)— A system used by the Maxwell Command Post to notify key
agencies of significant events.
Temporary (TEMPO)— Indicates temporary fluctuations in forecast conditions. Conditions
described will last for less than one hour and cover less than half of the designated TEMPO
period.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) – A weather forecast prepared by the 26th Operational
Weather Squadron (OWS) composed of required weather elements for Maxwell AFB airfield
and covers a 24-hour period. Forecast elements in the body of the forecast text refer to the
area within 5 NM of the center of the aerodrome complex. Operationally significant elements

        WEATHER WATCH/WARNING/ADVISORY NOTIFICATION CHAIN

A7.1. Resource Protection Notification Chain. Due to limited staffing and the time-critical
nature of this information, 26 OWS personnel cannot individually notify every agency requiring
weather watches, warnings, and advisories; hence, the application of a notification chain that
exploits installation command and communications channels. Procedures developed to this end
ensure weather personnel do not spend more time communicating than monitoring weather
conditions. All units receiving these weather products must be involved in a continuous program
of evaluation and improvement of the weather dissemination system, including inter-unit
dissemination. Agencies must make certain that weather dissemination procedures ensure those
needing information receive it. Individual commanders of units in need of weather information
are responsible for having their units listed in the notification chain that follows.
