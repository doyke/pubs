This directive establishes the policies that the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) will use to ensure that
the highest standards of practice are applied to all aspects of healthcare rendered to eligible beneficiaries.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This document represents a substantial revision of the previous Medical Operations Policy Directive, and
incorporates key tenets of Population Based Healthcare, Evidence Based Medicine, and Enrollment
Based Resourcing.

1. The AFMS will employ principles of Population Based Healthcare, Evidence Based Medicine, and
Enrollment Based Resourcing to continually optimize mission readiness, customer satisfaction, and pre-
ventive versus interventive health care.
   1.1. The AFMS will continually strive to ensure that its members are mentally and physically fit, so
   they can be persuasive in peace, decisive in war.
   1.2. Graduate Medical Education (GME) will provide the academic foundation for military medical
   education, research, and leadership development.
   1.3. Primary Care Managers (PCMs) will provide appropriate clinical and preventive healthcare to
   enrolled populations and will be supported by the establishment of regional Centers of Excellence
   and/or Specialized Treatment Services.
   1.4. Clinical Performance Improvement activities remain a vital part of these efforts and will be sup-
   ported by the use of objective measurements, such as those employed in the Air Force Performance
   Measurement Tool (AFPMT) and by the results of nationally recognized surveyors, such as the Joint
   Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).

2. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities.
2                                                                     AFPD44-1 1 SEPTEMBER 1999

    2.1. The Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG) establishes all policies concerning medical
    operations.
    2.2. The Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA), as an agent for the HQ USAF/SG, facili-
    tates the execution of policy, procedures, and processes supporting medical operations.
       2.2.1. The Clinical Quality Management Division (AFMOA/SGOC) assists with the formulation
       of plans, policies, and programs for the AFMS.
       2.2.2. Major Command Surgeons enforce this policy, monitor performance, and forward required
       data to HQ USAF/SG. Command Surgeons in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
       accomplish these responsibilities as they pertain to Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel.
       2.2.3. Medical treatment facility (MTF) commanders provide or arrange required health care ser-
       vices for active duty personnel and other eligible beneficiaries. Air Reserve Component medical
       unit commanders do not provide care, but arrange for care as applicable U.S. law and ARC policy
       allow.

3. This directive applies to all personnel who deliver and/or monitor health care services within the
AFMS and/or the ARC.

4. See Attachment 1 for a list of references pertaining to this policy directive.

5. See Attachment 2 for measuring compliance with this policy.

                           MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A2.1. The Clinical Quality Management Division of the Air Force Medical Operations Agency
(AFMOA/SGOC) will evaluate and report four key performance indicators: The number of malpractice
claims filed, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) survey scores,
Health Services Inspection (HSI) scores, and the number of suicides and nonfatal, self-injurious events
occurring among active duty individuals. AFMOA/SGOC routinely reviews malpractice claims as
directed by Department of Defense Directive 6025.14, DoD Participation in the National Practitioner
Data Bank, November 1, 1990. This data is collected via the DD Form 2526, Case Abstract for Malprac-
tice Claims or electronically through the Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System (CCQAS).
AFMOA/SGOC receives JCAHO survey results directly from the JCAHO; results of HSI evaluations are
received from the Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA). Data pertaining to active duty suicides and the
incidence of nonfatal, self-injurious events is obtained from the Suicide Event Surveillance System that is
maintained by the Force Health Protection and Surveillance Branch of Brooks Air Force Base, Texas.
   A2.1.1. As an indicator of the quality of care rendered to eligible beneficiaries, as well as overall cus-
   tomer satisfaction, AFMOA/SGOC will track the number of malpractice claims filed against the Air
   Force Medical Service. Data will be recorded on a quarterly basis and displayed in an aggregate for-
   mat. The goal is a continued downward trend, toward zero claims (Figure A.2.1.).
   A2.1.2. AFMOA/SGOC will also track the percentage of Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities
   (MTFs) which achieve a JCAHO score which meets and/or exceeds the existing national average.
   Data will be reported on a quarterly basis and will distinguish between hospitals and clinics. Achiev-
   ing and/or exceeding a specified JCAHO score will help to ensure that Air Force MTFs achieve and
   maintain a quality standard comparable to civilian facilities. (Figure A.2.2.).
   A2.1.3. AFMOA/SGOC will track the percentage of Air Force MTFs which achieve and/or exceed
   an established Health Services Inspection (HSI) score. The goal is to achieve no less than a Satisfac-
   tory range score with an increasing trend toward 100 percent (Figure A.2.3.).
   A2.1.4. Suicide and nonfatal, self-injurious events negatively impact the overall health and military
   medical readiness of the active duty force. AFMOA/SGOC will track this data on a quarterly basis;
   with a goal of achieving a continuous downward trend toward zero events per quarter (Figure A.2.4.).
