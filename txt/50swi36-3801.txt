Terms
Road Condition Green—Roads are clear. No unusual conditions to vehicle operations exist.
Road Condition Yellow—Indicates conditions of limited visibility (LESS THAN 300’) or slick/
snow—covered roads. Conditions require increased awareness by vehicle operators. Vehicle
headlights will be turned on and all patrols must take necessary driving precautions.
Road Condition Red—Indicates conditions of extremely limited visibility or icy roads with
deep snow. Vehicle movement will be limited to mission-essential only. Vehicle operators will
determine their status; SF is not to stop vehicles. Vehicle speeds will be no faster than
absolutely necessary. All vehicle operators must use headlights and extreme caution.
Road Condition Black—Indicates condition of extreme hazard on roadways. Only emergency
vehicles during emergency and Civil Engineering snow clearing equipment will operate on base
roads. If vehicle movement is necessary, requirements of condition RED will be met.
Closed—Schriever Air Force Base is CLOSED. Military members and Department of Defense
civilians are not permitted to come on or go from the base. Anyone coming on base while closed
will be advised of poor conditions and encouraged not to leave until off-base roads are safe for
travel. All mission essential personnel on base will remain in place until their replacements can
safely make it to the base. Housing residents on base are not permitted to drive on base until all
roads on Schriever AFB are safe for travel and are encouraged to remain on base until off-base
roads are safe for travel. Emergency exceptions should be coordinated with 50 SFS/CSC. All
Schriever events are cancelled until further notice.
Delayed Reporting—Non-mission essential and/or non-emergency essential personnel have an
additional amount of time to report for duty. There will be two types of delayed reporting- time
specific and delay specific. If the delay is time specific, personnel will be directed to report by
the time provided in the delay announcement (i.e. “Report time for non-mission essential
personnel is 0830.”) Plan to arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the specified delayed
reporting time to minimize interference with snow removal operations. If the delay is delay
specific (i.e. “There will be a one-hour delay.”), personnel are given additional time to arrive at
work, but should depart their residences as in a normal duty day.
Early Release—Non-mission essential and non-emergency personnel may depart their work
location at a specified time before the end of the normal duty day. Phased early release of
personnel normally takes place at 30-minute intervals to reduce the congestion of traffic
departing SAFB. See Attachment 3 for order of release.

Mission Essential Only—Only mission essential and/or emergency personnel must report for
duty. Also, mission essential and/or emergency personnel on SAFB at the time of the base
closure must remain until the situation is rectified or their replacement arrives. Supervisors
designate mission essential and/or emergency personnel.

Note 1: Annual leave or leave without pay (earned compensatory time off or credit hours may
be used as appropriate, in lieu of leave) should be charged for absences in excess of the
authorized absence/tardiness, unless management determines, after review of the facts in each
case, that the employee was unavoidably delayed and made every reasonable effort to get to
work but was unable to do so. If you make every reasonable attempt to report to work but are
unable to do so, you may submit a written report to your supervisor for an excused absence.
Your request must be endorsed by your supervisor and elevated to the second level supervisor
for approval. The request must explain the attempts made and the circumstances, which
prevented you from reporting for work. If such request for excused absence is approved, all
pertinent documents must be retained in official files by the supervisor for three years.
Management’s decision is based on conditions developing during nonworking hours which make
it difficult for employees to arrive at work on time. In such a situation, the appropriate
management official or supervisor may excuse short periods of tardiness (usually up to two
hours) without charging leave. Determining factors in this decision include: Distance between
the employee’s residence and place of work; mode of transportation normally used; efforts by the
employee to get to work; and success of other similarly situated employees being able to report
to work.

Note 2: This is a situation in which conditions are not uniform in their effect on the area but
there are areas so seriously affected that employees are prevented from getting to work. Because
of the scattered effect of the situation, a liberal annual leave or leave without pay policy is in
effect.

Note 3: If you are scheduled to be on duty in a telework capacity when the installation is closed,
you are excused from duty (AFI 36-815, IC 2002-01, Paragraph 7.6.3). AFI 36-815 has no
provisions to excuse you from duty when the installation is under delayed reporting or phased
early release due to inclement weather. However, supervisors should consider individual
circumstances and determine if the teleworking employee was prevented from working due to
inclement weather and should be excused from duty.
