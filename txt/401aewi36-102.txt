This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-1. This instruction establishes 401
AEW guidance governing the wing’s recognition program and it applies to personnel assigned to all 401st
Air Expeditionary Wing units. This instruction will be reviewed annually to ensure its currency. Maintain
and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.


1. Purpose. This program is designed to publicly recognize, on a quarterly basis, deployed personnel
who have rendered outstanding service to the wing’s air expeditionary mission.

2. General Purpose:
   2.1. A senior enlisted member selected by 401 AEW/CC will serve as the Wing Recognition Program
   (WRP) Manager and will be responsible for the overall administration of this program.
   2.2. Recognition is given on a quarterly basis or in conjunction with each AEF rotation.
   2.3. Award categories are:
       2.3.1. Airman of the Quarter (Airman Basic through Senior Airman).
       2.3.2. NCO of the Quarter (Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant).
       2.3.3. Senior NCO of the Quarter (Master Sergeant through Senior Master Sergeant).
       2.3.4. Company Grade Officer of the Quarter (Lieutenant through Captain).
   2.4. Individuals will be nominated for the award category corresponding to the grade they have held
   during the majority of the award period.

3. Nomination Requirements:
2                                                                 401AEWI36-102 30 JANUARY 2004


    3.1. HQ staff and subordinate units must submit their nomination packages to the WRP Manager not
    later than 30 days prior to the end of each AEF rotation. (The WRP Manager will notify all units of
    that rotation’s specific suspense date via e-mail.)
    3.2. Each nomination package will consist of the following three (3) items:
       3.2.1. Cover Sheet. Providing general information on the nominee (see Attachment 1.).
       3.2.2. AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award. Use bullet format, 9 lines maximum. Comments
       should emphasize the nominee’s job performance and mission impact. Any inputs in excess of 9
       lines will be deleted by the WRP Manager prior to scoring.
       3.2.3. Digital Picture. A 5” x 7” head and shoulders digital picture of the nominee. (Picture will
       be displayed with all quarterly winners at 401 AEW headquarters, if selected.)

4. Evaluation Procedures:
    4.1. Each unit will be sent a copy of every AF Form 1206 received by the WRP Manager (i.e., 7 units
    x 4 nominees/unit equals a maximum of 28 write-ups.) These copies will be sent out to units within
    one day after the nomination suspense date.
    4.2. For each award category (e.g, Airman, NCO, SNCO, and CGO), units will evaluate the AF
    Forms 1206 received and rank order them. To ensure impartiality, units will not score their own unit’s
    nominees. Units will ensure the evaluation process is equitable and honest. (Note: Use a score of “1”
    for the most qualified, a score of “6” for the least qualified.)
    4.3. For each award category, units will then annotate their overall “1-to-6” scores onto the “401
    AEW Recognition Program Unit Score Sheet,” which is located on the shared drive. (Mark the unit’s
    own nominees, plus any unit not submitting a nominee for a specific category, with “N/A” on this
    score sheet.) Units will e-mail or fax the score sheet back to the WRP Manager within five days of
    receipt of AF Form 1206s (actual suspense date will be set by the WRP Manager).
    4.4. For each award category, the WRP Manager will then transfer each unit’s scores to a master
    spreadsheet, and total the scores. The unit nominee receiving the lowest (i.e. best) score wins the nom-
    ination. In the event of a tie score, 401 AEW/CC will determine the overall winner.

5. Recognition. Winners will be awarded a 401 AEW plaque and letter of appreciation from 401 AEW/
CC, plus any gift certificates or coupon books donated by AAFES. All items will be forwarded to the win-
ner’s home unit if they have already re-deployed.
