                                            Chapter 2

                                 COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The AFSOC C2 system is based on the principles of centralized monitoring and
decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism, which keeps the AFSOC
Commander informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while enabling the wing or group
commander to exercise control over day to day operations.
2.2. Reporting Requirements. AC/mission commanders are responsible to contact an
appropriate command and control agency to ensure proper mission tracking/aircraft movement.
The local C2 agency is the focal point for all mission support activities. The AC or mission
commanders will establish a point of contact with the appropriate C2 agency prior to entering
crew rest and must inform them of any factor that may affect mission accomplishment.
     2.2.1. C2 contact information:
        2.2.1.1. AFSOC Command Center, Hurlburt Fld, FL. Defense Switching Network
        (DSN): 579-2171, Commercial: 800-451-7705 or 850-581-2966.
        2.2.1.2. ANG Operations Center. DSN 858-6001/commercial: 800-443-2985, 301-981-
        6001.
     2.2.2. 193rd Special Operations Wing (SOW) Command Post.               DSN 423-2249/2250
     commercial: 717-948-2249/2250.
2.3. Reporting Procedures. Report guidance is contained in Chapter 8 of this AFI, as well as
Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-3. (Commando Solo) Combat Aircraft
Fundamentals EC-130J.
2.4. Mission Commander. A mission commander will be designated, when necessary, and
should be a field grade officer.
2.5. Designated Non Commissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC). The highest-ranking
enlisted aircrew member is normally designated the NCOIC on the flight orders. Duties
commence when the aircrew reports for duty.
2.6. Mission Clearance Decision. The decision to delay or cancel a mission will be made by
the agency with Operational Control (OPCON), unit commander (or designated representative),
mission commander, or AC. Commanders must state the intent of the mission clearly. Then, the
AC must analyze the risk of the mission. If the risk of the mission is determined to be excessive
for mission accomplishment, the commander will be notified. Attempt to mitigate the risk
through appropriate measures.
     2.6.1. Diverting or re-routing a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON,
     except in an emergency or when required by enroute or terminal weather conditions or
     facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather related divert or reroute, the mission or
     Pilot In Command (PIC) must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
        2.6.1.1. The controlling agency directing the rerouting or diversion is responsible for
        ensuring the aircraft is compatible with departure, enroute, and destination requirement
        and facilities.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                              15


       2.6.1.2. The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitation
       that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
   2.6.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure
   the PIC is provided existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen, and
   appropriate airfield information from the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report
   (ASRR). If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while en route, the controlling agency
   will advise the aircraft commander of other suitable alternates.
   2.6.3. The controlling agency will coordinate with customs and ground service agencies to
   prepare for arrival. The PIC is the final authority on selecting a suitable alternate.
2.7. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Units should publish a comprehensive list of telephone
numbers to assist crews in coordinating mission requirements through appropriate C2 agencies.
2.8. Operational C2 Reporting. Aircrews on AFSOC-controlled missions are responsible for
transmitting these messages via Satellite Communications (SATCOM), High Frequency (HF),
DSN, etc., when transiting stations without an AFSOC (fixed or mobile) presence. Crews on
missions not controlled by AFSOC will report to the appropriate controlling agency. ANG units
will normally report through the Air National Guard Readiness Center for all other missions.
   2.8.1. HF Communications. In flight, HF is the primary means of worldwide C2
   communications. Restrict HF transmissions to operational traffic.
   2.8.2. Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) SATCOM.         UHF SATCOM supplements HF
   communications by providing a worldwide communications capability suitable for classified
   C2 transmissions.
   2.8.3. Stations Without C2 Agencies. Report movement information Actual Time of
   Departure (ATD), Estimated Time of Departure (ETD), Actual Time of Arrival (ATA),
   directly to the controlling C2 agency (as appropriate) as soon as possible, by any means
   available. After takeoff, relay pertinent data to the appropriate C2 agency by any means
   available.
       2.8.3.1. The departure message should include the aircraft call sign, ATD, and other
       applicable information.
       2.8.3.2. The arrival message should contain ATA and any other information the aircrew
       deems necessary to pass to C2 agencies. Other information may include but should not
       be limited to crew rest, maintenance status, refueling, or mission complete.
   2.8.4. Report movement information (departure, arrival, or diversion) and to the appropriate
   C2 agencies via discreet or global HF stations or SATCOM. Provide relay instructions for
   global HF stations to pass reports to appropriate agencies.
   2.8.5. Enroute Reporting. Full time connectivity between EC-130Js and the appropriate
   controlling agency is desired. Adhere to the following procedures:
       2.8.5.1. Continental United States (CONUS). C2 agencies may advise aircrews via the
       controlling Air Traffic Control (ATC) agency to establish contact with C2 agencies when
       communication is needed. Refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) concerning
       global HF station procedures in contacting MAINSAIL.
16                                                    AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


        2.8.5.2. Outside Continental United States (OCONUS). The controlling agency may
        specify increased reporting procedures (if needed) through a communications plan in the
        Operational Plan (OPLAN), OPORD, Fragmentary Order (FRAG), or Mission Directive.
        Aircrews will transmit messages or relay calls through discreet or global HF or UHF
        SATCOM for relay to the controlling C2 agency as specified in the communications plan.
        Maintain listening watch on discreet or US Global HF or UHF SATCOM as specified in
        the communications plan.
     2.8.6. Aircrews transmit a UHF or Very High Frequency (VHF) arrival advisory as soon as
     contact can be established with the destination C2 agency. The following information should
     be furnished: aircraft call sign, mission number, Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA),
     maintenance status, Distinguished Visitor (DV) codes and requirements, passenger and cargo
     status, hazardous cargo and remote parking requirements, additional support and services
     required, fuel requirements.
     2.8.7. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
     transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
2.9. Posse Comitatus. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to cooperate with civilian
law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-10, Format and Content of
Mission Directives incorporates the appropriate directive and provides uniform policies and
procedures to be followed concerning support provided to federal, state, and local civilian law
enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations and restrictions on the use of Air Force
personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law enforcement organizations. Report
all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian law enforcement authorities
through the appropriate C2 channels.

                      CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crew members, or those occupying a primary position
during flight, must be qualified, or in training for qualification, in that crew position. If non-
current, or in training for a particular event, the crewmember must be under the supervision of an
instructor while accomplishing that event (direct supervision for critical phases of flight).
   3.1.1. Basic aircraft qualification (F coded) crewmembers (i.e., FP and FL) may perform
   primary crew duties on any non-contingency sortie (including unilateral training, joint
   training and exercises) when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations, and only
   while under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective
   crew position.
   3.1.2. Basic mission capable (M coded) crewmembers (i.e., MP, MN, and ML) may perform
   primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit
   commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable crewmember to
   perform primary crew duties for specific mission tasking.
   3.1.3. Non-current or Unqualified (U coded) pilots (i.e., UP) may perform crew duties only
   on designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor
   or flight examiner pilot.
   3.1.4. Other Non-current or U-coded crewmembers (i.e., UN, UL, UE, and UK) may
   perform duties in their primary crew position on any sortie when under direct supervision of
   a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position. In this case, the
   student crewmember and the instructor or flight examiner fulfills the requirement for one
   primary position as specified in Table 3.1.
   3.1.5. Senior staff pilots or O-coded pilots (OP) who have completed a Senior Staff
   Familiarization course will occupy the left pilot seat only and be under direct Initial Point
   (IP) supervision. These individuals will log ―OP‖ for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the
   Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document. Refer to paragraph 9.13 for additional restrictions.
   3.1.6. Weapon Systems Officers (WSO) are qualified to occupy either the Flight Systems
   Officer (FSO) or Mission Systems Officer (MSO) position.
3.2. Crew Complement.
   3.2.1. Minimum crew complement will be as specified in the flight manual and Table 3.1.
   The Operations Group commander, or COMAFSOF, is the waiver authority for all crew
   positions. Crew complement cannot be waived below the minimum specified by the flight
   manual.
   3.2.2. Augmented crews are required when a mission cannot be safely completed within a
   basic Flight Duty Period (FDP). In those situations requiring augmentation, the crew must be
   augmented from the start of the duty period.
   3.2.3. Commando Solo and Super J combat training missions will be manned using the basic
   combat mission aircrew complements outlined in Table 3.1.

3.6. Crew Rest. Comply with AFI 11-202V3. MAJCOM/A3 may waive all or any part of crew
rest due to high priority mission tasking or change in unit readiness.
NOTE: Flight crews should be afforded crew rest times in excess of the minimum at enroute
stations, when possible, to give crews the opportunity to overcome the cumulative affects of
fatigue while flying on several consecutive days or transiting several time zones.
     3.6.1. Enroute Crew Rest and Ground Time:
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                           19


       3.6.1.1. A minimum 16-hour ground time between engine shutdown and mission takeoff
       should normally be planned. Extend the ground time if additional post flight duties are
       expected.
       3.6.1.2. Crew rest does not begin until all official duties are complete.
       3.6.1.3. ―Deadhead‖ Time. Reference 11-202V3 for restrictions.
   3.6.2. Crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to recover away from home station
   should be notified 24 hours before reporting for the mission. The first 12 hours are not
   considered crew rest, but are designed to allow crewmembers to resolve personal affairs.
   During these first 12 hours, a crewmember may perform limited non-flying duties.
   3.6.3. Alert Procedures. Reference AFI 11-202V3, AFSOC Sup 1.
   3.6.4. Crew Chiefs/Mission Essential Ground Personnel. The crew chief is responsible to
   the AC. The AC will determine how long the crew chief can safely perform aircraft recovery
   actions. The crew chief must have the opportunity to sleep 8 hours of each 24-hour period.
   See AFI 21-101, Maintenance Management Policy, for detailed guidance.
   3.6.5. Crew rest waivers approved for exercises and contingencies will be published in the
   OPORD/OPLAN or as approved by the MAJCOM/A3.
   3.6.6. Post-Mission Crew Rest. Refer to AFI 11-202V3, AFSOC Sup 1.
3.7. CDT and FDP. CDT includes both military duty and civilian work. CDT begins when an
individual reports for their first duty period (military or civilian). FDP begins when an
individual reports for their first flight related duty. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 for additional
guidance.

                         AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. The objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft for
launch with all equipment operational Fully Mission Capable (FMC). However, under specific
circumstances, some missions can be safely operated without all equipment being operational.
The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the AC. If an AC
accepts an aircraft for a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance
does not commit that AC, or a different AC, to subsequent missions with the same item or
system inoperative. Once an aircraft is not accepted by an AC, no other AC will be directed to
accept that aircraft with the known deficiency.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft prior to takeoff. It is impractical to
prepare a list that would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and
contingent circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding
items. An AC who accepted an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to
subsequent operations with the same degraded equipment. ACs are not committed to operations
with degraded equipment accepted by another AC.
     4.2.1. The AC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
     operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
     operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
     4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
     requirements/directives.
     4.2.3. ACs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
     requirements (revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements).
     4.2.4. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
     aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the AC
     may deviate. Report deviations (without waiver) to OG/CC within 48 hours.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis.
     4.3.1. MAJCOM/A3 (mission execution authority) is the MEL waiver authority. Initiate the
     request with MAJCOM C2 agency.
     4.3.2. The waiver request will include:
        4.3.2.1. Reason for the request.
        4.3.2.2. Individual crew member qualifications.
        4.3.2.3. Mission leg(s) requiring the waiver.
4.4. Technical Assistance Service. The AC may request (at anytime in the decision process)
technical support and additional assistance from their home unit, MAJCOM staff, and
maintenance representatives.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  21


4.5. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that
might be hazardous for continued use if the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station.
Waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3.
   4.5.1. The chief of maintenance, the senior maintenance officer, or the chief of the AFMC
   repair team must first authorize the release.
   4.5.2. After the maintenance release is obtained, contact MAJCOM for flight authorization.
   4.5.3. The maintenance release, MAJCOM approval, and the ACs concurrence are all
   required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified destination.
4.6. Fuel System. The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity
indicators is fuel balance and wing loading. Degraded operation is permissible, however, flight
crews must consider potentially trapped fuel and decreased range should further degradation
occur. The MEL, included in Table 4.12. along with the following paragraphs, provides
guidelines for degraded fuel system operations under most circumstances.
   4.6.1. For other than normal ground refueling/defueling operations and associated guidelines
   in this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main fuel tank with an inoperative
   indicator or its symmetrical tank except the following:
       4.6.1.1. Fuel transfer into a main tank with an inoperative indicator may be accomplished
       during contingency or emergency fuel need situations. All transfers, under these
       conditions, require more than one crewmember to monitor and coordinate the transfer.
       4.6.1.2. A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available. This source
       can be either the internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators or in-flight refueling
       tanker fuel onload data.
   4.6.2. One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative. Two main tank indicators may be
   inoperative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing.
       4.6.2.1. Verify the tank with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank quantity
       using a fuel tank dipstick.
       4.6.2.2. At enroute stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the
       inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank.
       4.6.2.3. Begin cross feed operation when the symmetrically opposite quantity indicator
       has decreased to 1,500 pounds (inboards) and 2,500 pounds (outboards).
       4.6.2.4. Do not perform engine out training.
       4.6.2.5. Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow.
       4.6.2.6. Plan to land with a minimum of 6,000 pounds calculated main tank fuel.
4.7. Navigation Systems. Refer to the navigation systems performance requirements as
outlined in Chapter 11 of this instruction and applicable sections of the Flight Information
Planning document for the route structures and intended areas of operation.
4.8. Soft Panel Operations.
   4.8.1. If a hard panel fails partially or completely, aircrews will revert to soft panel operation
   for the system. Once a soft panel is turned ON due to hard panel failure, it should not be
22                                                    AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     turned OFF, even through the ―Engine Shutdown‖ and ―Before Leaving Aircraft‖ checklists.
     The soft panel retains control of the particular system despite the aircraft being powered
     down.
     4.8.2. Because hard panel failures may be the result of a physical failure or loss of
     communication with the mission computer, an aircraft ―reboot‖ may recover hard panel
     functionality. To determine if hard panel functionality can be regained, the following
     procedures must be followed in sequential order (GROUND OPERATIONS only):
        4.8.2.1. Completely power down aircraft and accomplish the ―Before Leaving Aircraft‖
        checklist.
        4.8.2.2. Depending on the system affected, do not apply bleed air or hydraulics until hard
        panel functionality is determined. Complete all checklist items through the ―Power Up‖
        checklist. Do not proceed past the ―Power Up‖ checklist until it is verified that the hard
        panel has recovered.
        4.8.2.3. To determine if a hard panel has recovered, ensure hard panel and soft panel
        selections/settings are identical. Press the Line Select Key (LSK) to turn the soft panel
        OFF. If a Communications/Navigation/Identification (CNI) ―CHK HARD PNL‖ or a
        referenced hard panel fault Advisory Caution and Warning System (ACAWS) message
        does not appear, press the ―VERIFY OFF‖ LSK. If feasible, check hard panel
        functionality.
        4.8.2.4. If a CNI ―CHK HARD PNL‖ or a referenced hard panel fault ACAWS message
        appears, the hard panel has not recovered. The ―CHK HARD PNL‖ message indicates
        there is a mismatch between the soft panel and hard panel commands to the mission
        computer independent of physical switch positions.
        4.8.2.5. If it is determined that the hard panel has not recovered, at the ACs discretion,
        the mission may continue to a station supporting a repair capability, including en route
        stops. Do not reselect the hard panel.
     4.8.3. After returning to home station, or a repair facility with a hard panel malfunction,
     aircrews will shut down and turn the aircraft over to logistics personnel for appropriate
     maintenance repair actions.
     4.8.4. The availability of soft panels should be considered mission enhancers and may be
     used as suitable systems‘ back up. ACs must consider the impact on crew workload before
     electing to continue without hard panel functionality. Crew coordination is predicated on
     fully functional hard panels. This philosophy should not be unnecessarily compromised by
     continued or unconsidered use of soft panels.
4.9. Authority to Clear a Red X. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for detailed procedures on downgrading a
Red X for One-Time Flight. ACs may only clear a ―Red X‖ in the absence of qualified
maintenance personnel when required for mission accomplishment and he/she has obtained
authorization from the MXG/CC or designated representative. 193 MXG/CC has authorized
pilots and loadmasters to sign off the ―Red X‖ entry for intake/exhaust inspections, engine plugs
and panel security and connecting battery terminals, when away from home station without
further approval.

4.10. Maintenance Identifiers. Use the following maintenance identifiers to effectively
communicate an aircraft's status.
   4.10.1. Mission Essential. An item, system, or subsystem component essential for safe
   aircraft operation or mission completion will be designated Mission Essential (ME) by the
   AC in AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Include a brief
   explanation of the reason for ME status in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. An AC
   accepting an aircraft (one mission or mission segment) without an item or system does not
   commit that AC (or a different AC) to subsequent operations with the same item or system
   inoperative.
   4.10.2. Mission Contributing (MC). Non-ME discrepancies, which may become ME if
   circumstances change, are designated as MC in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block.
   Every effort will be made to clear the MC discrepancies at the earliest opportunity to the
   extent that maintenance skills, ground time, and spare part availability permit. If
   subsequently, in the ACs judgment, mission safety would be compromised by the lack of any
   component, he may re-designate the said component as ME. However, do not delay a
   mission to correct an MC discrepancy.
   4.10.3. Open Item. Any discrepancy not expected to adversely impact the current mission or
   any subsequent mission is not designated MC or ME. These items receive low priority and
   are normally worked at home station. Do not accept an aircraft from factories, modification
   centers, or depots unless all instruments are installed and operative, without the concurrence
   of the 193 MXG/CC.
4.11. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers.
   4.11.1. Installed – Number of components or systems installed.
      4.11.1.1. In some cases, a component can be controlled from either a hard panel or
      from a soft panel. Similarly, some indications can be viewed on either a hard panel
      or a soft panel. Since switch functions (or indications) may be du plicated on each
      of the three Communication/Navigation/Identification Management Unit (CNI-MU)
      displays, the number of switches (or indications) installed may not always be clear.
      To clarify this condition, switches (or indications) are listed as ‗1‘ in t he installed
      column even when they are duplicated on a soft panel.
      4.11.1.2. Although the indications on each pilot‘s Heads Down Displays (HDD) can
      be repeated on more than one HDD, repetitions of data in excess of one per pilot are
      not relevant for flight and are not counted in this MEL. In general, the flight deck is
      designed to provide one set of data for the pilot and one set of data for the copilot
      (in addition to the standby instruments). Thus, for most HDD indications, the
      ―number installed‖ is listed as ―2,‖ one for each pilot.
   4.11.2. Required – The minimum number (quantity) of items required for operation provided
   the conditions specified in the remarks or exception column are met.
      4.11.2.1. Unless otherwise noted, when the item is a switch (or indication) which is
      duplicated on a soft panel, the number required for dispatch may be satisfied by either the
      hard panel switch (or indication) or by the switch (indication) on one of the associated
      soft panels. For HDD indications, the number required is ‗2‘ if both pilots must have an
24                                                      AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


        indication, ‗1‘ if only one pilot must have an indication and ‗0‘ if neither pilot is required
        to have the indication. For essential flight data (heading, altitude, airspeed, attitude and
        when required, navigation data), the pilot‘s and copilot‘s displays must have independent
        sources.
NOTE: Common sense and good judgment must be used by all when determining minimum
equipment requirements, to preclude adverse operational impact or excessive maintenance
support requirements. In those instances where lack of replacement parts or qualified personnel
would cause a mission delay, the aircraft may continue operations as described in the MEL.
     4.11.3. Remarks and Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are contained
     in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight manual and
     other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
4.12. Special Mission Equipment (SME) Failures. The MSO will advise the AC about the
impact that SME failures have upon the specific mission accomplishment. The AC will decide
whether to repair the inoperative SME or perform the mission without the inoperative equipment.

                                             Chapter 5

                            AIRLAND/MISSION PARAMETERS

5.1. Aircraft Maximum Gross Weight Policy. Normally the aircraft gross weight will not
exceed 155,000 pounds for all EC-130 Super J and mission configured Super J aircraft or
164,000 pounds for all EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft. Waiver authority for operations above
those specified and up to 175,000 pounds is the MAJCOM/A3, COMAFSOF, or Commander,
Air Forces. Reference Chapter 9 for additional gross weight limitations associated with aircrew
training.
5.2. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the
flight manual are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures may be added to the
checklists in pencil.
   5.2.1. The Pilot Flying (PF) will initiate all checklists.
   5.2.2. Defensive systems crew coordination checklist items not applicable to the mission,
   training scenario, or profile being flown; need not be challenged nor responded to (e.g.,
   CMDS-"ARMED/SAFE" if Chaff and Flares are not loaded for pilot proficiency training
   flights). As a minimum, verify the systems are in Standby as part of the Power Up checklist.
   5.2.3. Approved Checklist Inserts. Inserts and guides, approved by 193 OG/OGV, may be
   placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in an in-flight guide. All checklist inserts
   must have an OPR and date/version. If any crewmember has recommendations or changes
   they should contact 193 OG/OGV.
   5.2.4. Combat Checklists. Normally, the FSO will read all combat checklists.
   5.2.5. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC)/Engines Running Onload/Offload (ERO)
   Checklists are included in the 193 SOW Sup 1 of this instruction.
5.3. Duty Station.
   5.3.1. All crewmembers will be at their duty stations during all takeoffs, departures, in-flight
   refueling, low level (below Minimum Safe Altitude [MSA]), approaches, and landings.
   During other phases of flight, crewmembers may leave their duty stations to meet
   physiological needs and perform normal crew duties.
   5.3.2. Crewmembers will notify the AC or MSO (as appropriate) prior to departing and upon
   returning to their assigned primary duty station.
5.4. Flight Station Entry. ACs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during takeoff, climb, air refueling, descent, and landing only if seats with seatbelts are
available. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to the flight deck crew
positions regardless of availability. During takeoff and landing, observers will be seated in a seat
approved for use during takeoff and landing with appropriate safety belts and shoulder harnesses
fastened. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to meet the requirements of
AFI 11-202V3, applicable supplement.
54                                                      AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     5.4.1. Hold the number of persons on the flight deck to the minimum commensurate with
     mission requirements.
     5.4.2. For takeoff and landings, limit the number of persons on the EC-130J flight deck to
     six.
5.5. Flight Deck Congestion and Loose Objects.
     5.5.1. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the center pedestal in a position that
     covers or hides from view any switch, light, or gauge. Do not place any item in a location
     which will restrict the power lever movement.
     5.5.2. Place only soft items on the top bunk in the cockpit.
     5.5.3. Do not place any item on the special systems power control panel (aft of the crew
     entrance door).
     5.5.4. When SME will be operated, do not allow items to block any SME air intakes nor
     allow items to be placed unsecured where movement, loading, or unloading of those items
     will possibly damage the equipment.
5.6. Takeoff and Landing Policy. The PIC (designated with the ―A‖ code on the flight
authorization) will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs and landings.
5.7. Use of Outside Observer. When available, use crewmembers to assist in outside clearing
during all taxi operations and in-flight during arrivals and departures.
5.8. Seat Belts. While seated, the pilot and copilot will have seat belts fastened from the
beginning of the Start Engines Checklist until engine shutdown. All other occupants will be
seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoff, landing and when turbulence is encountered
or anticipated, unless crew duties require otherwise.
EXCEPTION: Flight examiners, instructors, crewmembers performing scanner duties, outside
observers during taxi, and loadmasters performing required duties during taxi, takeoffs and
landings; however, they will have a designated seat and required restraint available.

EXCEPTION: Crewmembers may taxi without the shoulder harnesses fastened for
repositioning the aircraft.
5.9. Crew Bunks. When the aft bunk is used for takeoff and landing on the EC-130J (CS), a
crewmember will be on headset. Crew bunks are primarily for use by crewmembers.
5.10. Aircraft Lighting. Comply with Chapter 4 of this AFI, AFI 11-202V3 and applicable
Supplements, and all other applicable T.O.s. Use appropriate lighting to ensure safe and
effective mission accomplishment. Contingency/combat operations may dictate that external
lights are reduced or off and internal lights are limited to the minimum necessary for aircrew
activities. Mitigate the risk of flying with reduced lighting through the use of NVGs, thorough
mission planning, and accurate situational awareness.
5.11. Advisory Calls: The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departures,
arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. The
following advisory calls are mandatory during flight:
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                             55


   5.11.1. ―Thousand to go‖ – Pilot Monitoring (PM) calls when aircraft is 1000‘ from assigned
   altitude (climbs or descents).
   5.11.2. Transition Altitude – PM calls during climbs and descents.
   5.11.3. ―One Hundred Above‖ – PM calls when aircraft is 100‘ from Minimum Descent
   Altitude (MDA) or Decision Height (DH).
   5.11.4. ―Minimums‖ – PM calls on non-precision approaches at the MDA.
   5.11.5. ―Land‖ – PM calls on precision approaches at the DH, if airfield environment is in
   sight.
   5.11.6. ―Go-around‖ – Any crewmember has determined that a safe landing cannot be
   accomplished.
   5.11.7. NVG call-outs are contained in AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo.
   5.11.8. CAT 2 ILS approach call-outs; to be determined.
5.12. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.12.1. Aircraft Interphone.
       5.12.1.1. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical phases of flight.
       5.12.1.2. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and mission
       accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, within 15 minutes of on-station
       and off-station times, and any flight below 10,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) (unless
       final cruise altitude is 10,000 feet MSL or below).
       5.12.1.3. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio
       transmissions. Be aware that bleed over from the interphone system may occur during
       SME broadcast operations.
       5.12.1.4. If the CVR is operating, classified interphone or radio transmissions will be
       recorded. Therefore, ensure at least 30 minutes of power on the aircraft after classified
       conversations.
       5.12.1.5. Non-aircrew members/passengers may monitor the interphone or radio when
       approved by the AC. The AC will brief communications policy to these personnel prior
       to flight.
   5.12.2. Radios. The pilot operating the radios (FSO/Loadmaster (LM) for C2 and/or Air
   Refueling (AR) frequencies) will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update the crew
   when the primary radio changes.
5.13. Wind Limitations. Maximum crosswind limits are in accordance with flight manual
limitations. Pilots remain within the ―recommended‖ or ―caution‖ areas of the crosswind charts
for normal takeoffs and landings. See Chapter 9 for additional training restrictions.
5.14. Maximum Effort Procedures. Maximum effort takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
5.15. Substandard Airfield Operations. Operations to substandard airfields will not be
performed.

5.16. Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements.
     5.16.1. Takeoff. Minimum runway length for a normal take off is critical field length or
     Table 5.1 limitation, whichever is greater.
     5.16.2. Full Stop Landing. Minimum runway length is the corrected landing distance over a
     50 foot obstacle plus the Runway Visual Range (RVR)/visibility correction factor (Table
     5.2) or Table 5.1 limitations, whichever is greater.
     5.16.3. NVG Full Stop Landing. Minimum runway length for a NVG landing is the
     corrected landing distance over a 50 foot obstacle plus 1,000 feet or Table 5.1 limitations,
     whichever is greater.
     5.16.4. Touch and Go landings. Minimum runway length is listed in Table 5.1 for normal
     touch and go landings and NVG touch and go landings.
     5.16.5. Taxiway Width. Minimum runway/taxiway width is listed in Table 5.1

Table 5.1. Minimum Runway/Taxiway Width Requirements.
              Type of Maneuver                                    Runway Length

 Equal to or greater than 40, (3/4)                                          500 Feet
     5.16.6. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) Limitations. Be conservative when dealing with
     unknown conditions. Normally, RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps.
     During periods of reported low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR
     than reported for the runway. Consider the runway surface wet when water on the runway
     causes a reflective glare. Limit EC-130J operations into and out of slush or water covered
     runways to a covering of one inch.
     5.16.7. Crash Fire Rescue (CFR). CFR requirements at non-USAF active flying bases are
     as follows:
        5.16.7.1. Up to four takeoffs and landings within 14 consecutive days may be
        accomplished at a Landing Zone (LZ) or airfield without CFR.
        5.16.7.2. For more frequent operations at an LZ or airfield, refer to AFPAM 32-2004,
        Aircraft Fire Protection for Military Operations Other Than War, to calculate CFR
        requirements.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                57


5.17. Aircraft Taxi Procedures and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria.
   5.17.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet. With wing
   walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet, unless the aircraft is at home station,
   taxiing along locally established taxi lines, which have been measured to ensure a minimum
   of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction.
   5.17.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshalling. The AC should use wing walkers or a crewmember on interphone
   positioned at the paratroop door(s) to act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow
   taxiways.
   5.17.3. After landing and clearing the runway, and with approval of the pilot, the loadmaster
   is authorized to open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp. The ramp will not be lowered
   below 12 inches above horizontal. Equipment, cargo, and passengers must remain secure in
   the cargo compartment.
5.18. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential
for engine FOD. Crews should carefully review airfield layout during mission planning. Be
familiar with taxi routes, turn requirements, and areas for potential FOD. Use low speed ground
idle whenever possible.
5.19. Reverse Taxi:
   5.19.1. The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with the
   loadmaster and marshallers (when available).
   5.19.2. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
   5.19.3. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches above
   horizontal.
   5.19.4. The loadmaster will be on the aircraft ramp in the best position to direct reverse taxi,
   report any hazards, and to provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns,
   distance remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.
   5.19.5. Do not taxi within 25 feet of an obstacle nor stop less than 25 feet from an
   obstruction, even if using a wing walker.
5.20. Arresting Cables. The EC-130J will not takeoff or land on a runway with raised
approach or departure end arresting gear (does not include recessed cables), unless the following
criteria are met:
   5.20.1. Aircraft may begin takeoff roll immediately past the approach end arresting gear,
   provided takeoff data is computed using the actual runway remaining.
   5.20.2. Unless departure end arresting gear is removed, takeoff data will not be computed
   using runway length extending beyond departure end arresting gear/barrier cables.
   5.20.3. Do not land on or prior to approach end arresting cables, and ensure the usable
   runway length beyond the cable meets the minimum runway length requirement for the EC-
   130J.
58                                                       AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     5.20.4. Do not land on a runway with a departure end arresting cable, unless the runway
     length available prior to the cable meets the minimum runway length requirements for the
     EC-130J.
5.21. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Criteria. The mission directive is confirmation that
AFSOC/CC, or COMAFSOF with area jurisdiction, has reviewed the airfields of intended
operation for obstructions and other hazards IAW Air Force and AFSOC directives. The wing or
COMAFSOF will advise crews of known obstructions and other factors that could be hazardous
to airland operations.
5.22. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The PM will operate the landing gear and
flaps. Actuate the landing gear or flaps only after command of the PF. Prior to actuation of the
landing gear or flaps, the PM will acknowledge the command by repeating it.
5.23. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved
usable portion of the runway. The AC will make the decision regarding intersection takeoffs.
Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) computations must be based on the runway remaining at the
point the takeoff is initiated.
5.24. Tactical Flight Operations.
     5.24.1. A functional radar altimeter, set to the appropriate terrain clearance, is required on all
     flights employing tactical altitudes.
     5.24.2. Both HUDs will be operational for tactical training flight operations.
     5.24.3. If the GCAS audio is not heard and the minimum altitude is exceeded, use the word
     "altitude" to relay this information to the pilot flying the aircraft. The PF will take immediate
     action to correct the altitude.
     5.24.4. If combat/contingency mission requirements dictate, mission qualified aircrews may
     plan and fly day or night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) ingress/egress routes at
     tactical altitudes, approved by COMAFSOF.
5.25. Fuel Planning. Minimum landing fuel for the EC-130J is 4,000 lbs.                 Use the fuel
planning procedures in AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo, Attachment 2.
5.26. CS Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) Operations. If VTWA is to be deployed, the crew
will coordinate with the airspace-controlling agency to secure a block altitude. The TWA will
not be deployed overland, except for contingency operations. If TWA are deployed over water,
they will be secured before entering land.
     5.26.1. VTWA Procedures.
        5.26.1.1. The MSO will coordinate VTWA operations with the AC prior to deployment
        of the VTWA.
        5.26.1.2. The VTWA operator will request clearance to retrieve the VTWA.
        5.26.1.3. The MSO will coordinate with the AC prior to retrieving the VTWA.
     5.26.2. VTWA Retrieval. Unaccelerated, straight and level flight is the best platform for
     retrieving the VTWA.
        5.26.2.1. The PF will hand fly the aircraft (autopilot disconnected) or;
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                              59


     5.26.2.2. Fly with autopilot connected. With the autopilot connected, altitude hold may
     be used, however, no flight director lateral modes may be selected.
     5.26.2.3. If a turn is required during retrieval, with the wire between 1.5 and 50 feet, the
     PF must coordinate with the MSO to ensure the VTWA is extended more than 50 feet,
     retrieved to 1.5 feet, or secured before the turn is commenced.
     5.26.2.4. Pilots should ensure the altitude remains stable throughout the retrieval.
  5.26.3. VTWA Extended.
     5.26.3.1. Plan to use 10-15 degrees of bank, however, do not exceed 30 degrees of bank.
     Using minimum bank lessens the probability of VTWA excessive swing.
     5.26.3.2. Do NOT perform turn reversals (an abrupt turn in the opposite direction).
     5.26.3.3. Do NOT unload or G-up the aircraft.
     5.26.3.4. Use only standard rate climb/descent for altitude changes.
  5.26.4. VTWA Excessive Swing Considerations. Unaccelerated, straight and level flight,
  while extending the drogue, is the best means to dampen excessive VTWA swing.
  5.26.5. HTWA Extension/Retrieval. The MSO must notify the AC whenever deploying or
  retrieving the HTWA.
  5.26.6. TWA Guillotine Considerations. During controlled situations, TWA guillotine
  must be the last consideration to resolve TWA problems (such as excessive swing, loss of
  VTWA monitor, or failure to retrieve due to mechanical failures). Consider the following:
     5.26.6.1. Clear. Eliminate possible damage to vessels, aircraft, people, or other objects.
     5.26.6.2. Altitude. Flying at the lowest possible altitude allows better clearing for the
     guillotine.
     5.26.6.3. Airspeed. Fly at the slowest practical airspeed.
     5.26.6.4. Location. Record the location of the aircraft when the VTWA is guillotined.
  5.26.7. VTWA Operations in a Tactical Environment.
     5.26.7.1. The VTWA will not be retrieved during a Fade, Scram, or in anticipation of
     impending tactics maneuver during an actual threat situation. At shorter VTWA lengths
     (less than 50 feet), the reaction time required to guillotine the antenna is significantly
     reduced due to the increased rate of swing at shorter lengths. Increasing the VTWA
     length can significantly increase this reaction time and reduce the possibility of damage
     to the aircraft.
     5.26.7.2. If the VTWA is in and seated under these conditions, it should remain in and
     seated.
     5.26.7.3. During a Fade maneuver, the VTWA may be left at the length required to
     continue broadcast operations, but in no case less than 50 feet. If a fade is initiated and
     the VTWA is less than 50 feet, it will be extended to a minimum of 50 feet upon
     initiation of a Fade in anticipation of a possible threat maneuvers.
60                                                     AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


       5.26.7.4. During a heightened threat situation such as a Scram or other tactics not
       requiring aggressive turns or G loading/unloading, the VTWA should be extended out to
       a minimum of 200 feet if possible. This will significantly increase the time available to
       react in the event an aggressive tactics maneuver is initiated which would necessitate
       guillotining the VTWA.
       5.26.7.5. During any threat situation, where the crew anticipates aggressive maneuvers,
       the AC will initiate the Combat Emergency Egress Checklist. This does not require the
       flight deck crew to immediately guillotine the VTWA and/or HTWA, but rather signals
       the flight deck crew to evaluate the situation and attempt to call for the guillotine in a
       safer and less congesting area if at all possible. Calling the checklist should also alert the
       Trailing Wire position that a guillotine call or initiation of aggressive tactics maneuvers
       that would require guillotining the VTWA and/or HTWA are imminent.
       5.26.7.6. If the trailing wire operator hears an aircrew member call for a threat maneuver
       the VTWA and/or HTWA will be immediately guillotined, if deployed.
       5.26.7.7. If a Hard or Break turn is initiated and the flight deck crew does not call for a
       Guillotine, the trailing wire operator will guillotine the VTWA and/or HTWA, if
       deployed.
5.27. Threat Maneuvers. At the ACs discretion, the use of all aggressive tactics procedures (as
outlined in AFTTP 3-1, Vol 32) are authorized when the crew is in an actual threat situation
which requires immediate action to protect the crew and aircraft.
5.28. Controlled Cockpit Rest. Reference AFI 11-202V3 for restrictions.
5.29. Arrival. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo for guidance.
5.30. Traffic Pattern. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo for guidance.
5.31. Random Approaches. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo for guidance on random
approaches.
5.32. ERCC/ERO. Do not use ERO procedures when explosive cargo is involved unless
authorized by the exercise operation order or contingency Air Tasking Order (ATO). Reference
Chapter 10 of this instruction.

   Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) requires civilian attire, wear conservatively styled civilian
   clothing.
   6.1.2. All aircrew members will have Nomex flight gloves readily available during flight. It
   is recommended that primary crewmembers wear the gloves during engine start, takeoffs and
   landings.
   6.1.3. Crewmembers will remove rings and scarves prior to performing aircrew duties in, or
   around, the aircraft.
   6.1.4. Personnel will have the appropriate items of clothing in their possession when flying
   in Arctic and Antarctic regions.
EXCEPTION: Not applicable to transoceanic flights.
6.2. Personal Requirements and Professional Equipment. Crewmembers will carry or wear
personal and professional equipment as follows:
   6.2.1. All crewmembers will have a headset and operable NVG-compatible flashlight on all
   flights.
   6.2.2. Helmets and Oxygen Masks.
      6.2.2.1. All crewmembers will have a personal helmet and oxygen mask anytime NVGs
      are worn, parachutes are pre-positioned aboard the aircraft, or when operational
      requirements exist.
      6.2.2.2. Protective Headgear. The AC should direct the wearing of flight helmets during
      flight operations where aircraft maneuvering may pose a hazard to crewmembers, not in a
      seat with the seat belt fastened, or secured at an observation window with an approved
      harness.
      6.2.2.3. Quick-Don Oxygen Masks.
          6.2.2.3.1. If parachutes are not pre-positioned aboard the aircraft, and quick-don
          oxygen masks are installed, aircrew members are not required to carry personal
          helmets and oxygen masks unless an operational requirement exists.
          6.2.2.3.2. When quick-don oxygen masks are installed, they will be preflighted (to
          include communications hook up), if they are used as the primary oxygen source. If a
          personal helmet and oxygen mask is the primary oxygen source throughout the flight,
          there is no requirement for the quick-don mask to be preflighted or hooked up.
   6.2.3. Identification Tags. Two are required for all flights and should be worn around the
   neck or carried in the flight suit pocket.
   6.2.4. Corrective Lenses. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 and applicable supplement.
62                                                      AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     6.2.5. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except actual
     combat missions). Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.
     6.2.6. Passport. Review the Foreign Clearance Guide for passport requirements.
     6.2.7. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, pins,
     clips, other hair fasteners, or earrings in, on, or around the aircraft or on the flight line.
EXCEPTION: Crewmembers may wear plain elastic hair fasteners and/or barrettes providing
the fasteners do not interfere with the wearing of headsets or the donning of oxygen equipment
and will be accounted for before and after flight.
     6.2.8. A reflective belt or suitable substitute will be worn on the flight line during hours of
     darkness or periods of reduced visibility, when not in the vicinity of the aircraft.
6.3. Aircraft Tool Kits. A tool kit will be on board the aircraft for all flights.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will ensure the publications
specified in Table 6.1 are current and available on the aircraft for required missions. Only one

6.29. Authenticators and Classified Documents. Obtain and safeguard current authenticators
and other classified materials required for the area being transited. Carry authenticators when
flying into an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), participating in exercises, on overseas
missions, deployments, and when specified in operation plans. The Communications Security
(COMSEC) material required depends on the theater of operation and user. The base COMSEC
custodian has access to the Air Force COMSEC General Publication (AFKAG) 44/AFKAG 14
and can assist in obtaining the material required for the mission.
6.30. Alcoholic Beverages. MAJCOM/A3 may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic beverages
to passengers in-flight.
6.31. AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Review AFTO
Form 781 before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems. The exceptional
release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or
authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If one of these individuals is not
available, the AC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure the USAF Aviation Into-plane
Reimbursement Air Card is on board the aircraft.
6.32. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.32.1. Aircraft Refueling. For normal refueling, two qualified personnel are required.
   Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform refueling duties at austere
   locations, or when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be
   delayed. Crewmembers may augment maintenance refueling teams at enroute stops.
   Crewmembers acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will comply with T.O. 00-
   25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding and refueling job guide.
   Crew chiefs should be scheduled on those missions where a need is anticipated.
   6.32.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent ground operations (simultaneous
   refueling or de-fueling while cargo or maintenance operations are being performed) are
   authorized in accordance with T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
   Grounding/Bonding.
       6.32.2.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
       6.32.2.2. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e., wooden) pallets is
       authorized. Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel
       servicing. When loading vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either
       completely inside the cargo compartment, or outside of the established fuel servicing
       safety zone before fuel servicing lines can be pressurized.
EXCEPTION: Diesel and turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered vehicles can
be on-loaded or off-loaded without having to stop fuel flow.

EXCEPTION: Passengers are prohibited in the cargo compartment during winching.
   6.32.3. The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing (refuel/defueling) operations
   only:
       6.32.3.1. Passengers are not allowed on board unless expressly directed by
       MAJCOM/A3, or in combat. When directed, refueling or defueling with passengers or
       patients on board is authorized only for aeromedical evacuation missions IAW T.O. 00-
68                                                      AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


        25-172. In this case, a qualified crewmember is required to monitor the passenger
        compartment.
        6.32.3.2. Electric and electronic equipment may be left on provided it does not radiate
        energy; but is not turned on or off during refueling.
     6.32.4. Fire Protection. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum
     requirements for fire protection during engine start. If available, position a portable fire
     extinguisher for added fire protection. A fireguard is required for all engine starts, including
     the APU. In the absence of additional ground personnel, the loadmaster or ground controller
     may act as the fireguard.
     6.32.5. Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Run Ups. A mixture of aircrew and maintenance
     personnel will not normally accomplish engine runs. When an aircrew member is required to
     start or run up engines for maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply:
        6.32.5.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and
        preparations for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to:
        Intake/exhaust inspections, access panel security servicing, and AFTO Form 781
        documentation.
        6.32.5.2. Use the pilot and loadmaster checklists. Begin with the ―POWER UP
        CHECKLIST‖ (if required) and complete all appropriate checklists through the
        "BEFORE LEAVING THE AIRPLANE" checklist.
        6.32.5.3. Deviate from the flight crew checklist only when maintenance requires less
        than four engines to be started.
        6.32.5.4. Operate symmetrical engines when power settings above ground idle are
        required.
     6.32.6. Towing. Aircrew members normally will not participate in towing operations. If
     required to occupy cockpit positions during towing operations conducted by personnel not
     familiar with C-130J towing procedures, the AC will coordinate with the senior maintenance
     officer or superintendent to ensure the towing supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-
     USAF installations, the AC must have approval from the airfield operations officer or
     manager prior to towing. The AC will ensure the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on
     their duties and the associated hazards. Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as
     to the qualification of tow team personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to
     tow the aircraft until qualified Air Force personnel can be located. The towing supervisor
     will not be a crewmember.
6.33. Aircrew Dash One Preflight.
     6.33.1. Once completed, the aircraft aircrew preflight inspection is valid for 72 hours
     provided access to the aircraft is controlled or monitored. The use of a boxcar seal is an
     acceptable method of controlling access.
     6.33.2. Preflight inspection followed by sealing of an aircraft may be used to prepare for
     Contingency, Alert, Operational Readiness Exercise (ORE) or Operational Readiness
     Inspection (ORI) mission(s) only.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                69


   6.33.3. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick-turn, a thorough visual
   inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or
   servicing.
   6.33.4. Aircrew preflight inspections are normally done in preparation for flight by the
   assigned aircrew just prior to the mission. Having a partial aircrew, not scheduled to fly,
   accomplish multiple aircraft preflight duty is not an acceptable practice, except to prepare for
   ORE, ORI, or contingencies.
   6.33.5. The following guidelines apply to aircrew assigned to preflight and/or seal aircraft.
   A loadmaster will not preflight more than 4 aircraft in a 12-hour period or perform preflight
   duties for more than 12 hours. Crew rest according to AFI 11-202V3 is required. Aircrews
   performing preflight duties will be afforded 12 hours rest between preflight shifts.
   6.33.6. Unqualified crewmembers may not preflight aircraft except under the supervision of
   an instructor.
6.34. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Documentation. AFE personnel will accomplish a
thorough aircraft preflight inspection prior to each mission. Local training missions only require
a preflight inspection prior to the first flight of the day.
   6.34.1. The AC or designated representative will ensure appropriate serviceable protective
   clothing, aircrew flight and survival equipment is on board the aircraft for the entire mission.
   6.34.2. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, review the
   AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required equipment has
   been certified as installed by AFE, the initial check has been signed by AFE, and
   configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.34.3. Missing Equipment. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will make an
   entry in the AFTO Form 781.
6.35. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
   6.35.1. Oxygen. Before takeoff, oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to
   accomplish the flight planned route from the Equal Time Point (ETP) to the first suitable
   airfield (should oxygen be required) OR a minimum of 5 liters (Super J)/10 liters
   (Commando Solo-with mission crew), whichever is greater.
       6.35.1.1. Since the EC-130J flight deck can accommodate more crewmembers than there
       are oxygen regulators, all EC-130J aircraft will have eight protective breathing devices
       (PBD), or Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) permanently pre-positioned on
       the aircraft.
       6.35.1.2. On missions, carrying passengers, distribute EPOS to each passenger regardless
       of planned flight altitude. EPOS will be distributed and their use demonstrated before
       departure.
       6.35.1.3. Do not remove the loadmasters' emergency equipment (cargo compartment
       quick dons/smoke masks) for use by flight deck crew members.
       6.35.1.4. Aircrew will comply with the oxygen requirements specified in AFI 11-202V3.
70                                                    AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


        6.35.1.5. Crewmembers will have an oxygen mask connected and readily available for
        use from before engine start until engine shutdown. Crewmembers that do not have
        access to the aircraft oxygen system will have an EPOS, or PBD within arm's reach for
        flights above Flight Level (FL) 250.

            security, technical escort teams, etc.
        6.38.4.3.4. If estimated time enroute is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
        preclude timely message receipt at destination, relay ETA and cargo information to
        the base of first intended landing by priority telephone. If available ask the C2
        agency at the departure base to relay this information to base operations at the point
        of first intended landing.
     6.38.4.4. Before engine start. Remove placards, when used, from the aircraft. Give the
     controlling agency parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify the fire
     fighting agency has the hazardous materials information; otherwise, request the following

        parked in areas isolated from non-associated personnel and facilities. When such cargo is
        aboard, the AC is responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly identified to the tower or
        ground control. If the aircraft is not directed to an isolated area, identify the cargo again
        to tower or ground control. When identification is acknowledged, the host is solely
        responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host procedures be questionable,
        submit trip reports or hazard reports as appropriate, to document such occurrences.
        6.38.4.9. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. When missions operate
        on non-military bases, the briefing to the AC will include placarding requirements and, if
        required, placards will be furnished at the on-load base. The shipper and receiver must
        make prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials
        requiring placarding. The shipper and receiver are responsible for cargo identification,
        fire fighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
        6.38.4.10. Unscheduled Landing Due to In-Flight Emergency. Transmit unclassified
        information to the appropriate ATC facility. Include the location of the hazardous cargo
        and the information listed in paragraph 6.38.4.3.3. After landing, contact the appropriate

          6.43.2.2.1. Missions generated in the boundaries of the 48 contiguous states that do
          not plan to penetrate or exit the CONUS ADIZ.
78                                                   AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


            6.43.2.2.2. Non-training peacetime missions where cancellation or return to base for
            Mode 4 failure would seriously degrade effectiveness (i.e., disaster relief, SAR,
            aeromedical evacuation, etc.).
        6.43.2.3. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS
        for overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through
        North America Air Defense Command on UHF frequency 364.2.
        6.43.2.4. Aircraft with an inoperable Mode 4 will continue to the intended destination.
        Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
        maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
        aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable
        airspace control order, ATO, or communications plan.
        6.43.2.5. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate
        the Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Prior to departing
        for any destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local
        COMSEC managers for guidance.
6.44. TOLD Data. Pilots will derive TOLD from the aircraft mission computer. A pilot
crewmember will crosscheck the mission computer TOLD data for accuracy by using the CNI
verification procedures or approved Portable Flight Planning System calculated data. Verify the
data IAW TO 1-C-130J-1-1.
6.45. Departure Briefing. The pilot making the takeoff will brief the crew IAW the flight
manual, and local briefing guides.
6.46. On-Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are normally considered ―on time‖ if the aircraft
is airborne no later than 30 minutes after the scheduled takeoff time.
     6.46.1. Early departures are authorized provided local facilities, down-range facilities,
     aircrew and mission impact are evaluated and no adverse effect will result.
     6.46.2. AR and Mission Requirements. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted as
     necessary to meet the AR rendezvous control time, e.g., Air Refueling Control Time
     (ARCT), Rendezvous Control Time (RZCT) or mission on-station time. Notify scheduling
     and controlling agencies of any deviations affecting the control or on-station time.
6.47. Departure Monitoring. Cockpit crewmembers will back up the PF and report any
deviations from the planned departure. When radar facilities are available, departures will be
radar monitored to the maximum extent possible.
6.48. Flight Progress. Use all available navigational aids to monitor mission computer and
navigation systems performance for maintaining aircraft position and course centerline.
Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability, which degrades centerline
accuracy to the air traffic management/controlling facility.
6.49. ―Due Regard‖ Procedures. When a unit commander authorizes a mission to be flown in
international airspace over the high seas and in-flight operational requirements conflict with
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules and procedures, the aircraft commander
may make the decision to proceed using ―due regard‖ procedures IAW FLIP General Planning.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               79


6.50. In-flight Meals. Pilots should not plan to eat the same menu items from the same vendor.
If unavoidable, they should not eat meals within 90 minutes of each other.
6.51. Communications.
   6.51.1. HF Communications (According to AFR 700-20). Confine message traffic to
   essential operational matters. Attempt to perform an HF radio ground check prior to takeoff
   if the use of HF radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF contact
   before going out of UHF and VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the
   controlling HF station and an alternate means of relay of ATC information in oceanic areas is
   not available, return to the nearest suitable support base.
   6.51.2. General. Accomplish all communications IAW FLIP or as directed by the
   controlling agency. Provide Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) position and
   weather observations when required. If unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt relay
   through the GLOBAL HF stations.
   6.51.3. Other Reports. In-flight harassment or hostile action against EC-130J aircraft.
   Aircraft subjected to harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact
   the nearest USAF air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft
   nationality, type, insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time,
   speed when harassed, and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest
   C2 agency. Also attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
   Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6, Volume V and AFI 10-206,
   Operational Reporting.
6.52. In-Flight Emergency Procedures. Report deviations from directives that may occur as a
result of an emergency in accordance with AFI 11-202V3, applicable supplement. A
CONFERENCE SKYHOOK may be initiated when additional expertise is necessary to cope
with emergencies or other conditions. Communications procedures are as follow:
   6.52.1. Local Area. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate
   frequencies.
   6.52.2. Enroute. When out of UHF or VHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch
   with the nearest or controlling C2 center as appropriate.
   6.52.3. Provide the following information when time permits.
       6.52.3.1. Narrative description of the situation to include actions taken by the crew and
       the intentions of the AC.
       6.52.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
       6.52.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
       6.52.3.4. Position.
       6.52.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
       6.52.3.6. Planned landing base.
6.53. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel may meet the
aircraft.
80                                                       AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


6.54. Continuing Flight with an Engine Loss. A flight may proceed on 3 engines to its
destination if 2-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail both en route and
at the point of intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times. If these
conditions cannot be met, the flight will terminate at the nearest facility (preferably military),
which in the judgment of the AC offers safe and favorable operating conditions.
6.55. Weather Forecasts. IAW AFI 11-202V3, and applicable supplement.
6.56. Descent and Approach. The ―Descent Checklist‖ should be initiated upon receiving
clearance for initial descent. The desired result is to separate the ―Descent Checklist‖ and the
―Before Landing Checklist‖ by approximately 10 minutes to allow for proper cool down of
special mission equipment. The entire crew will monitor the primary interphone once the
―Descent Checklist‖ is initiated.
6.57. Instrument Approach Procedures. Refer to AFI 11-202V3, applicable supplement and
AFMAN 11-217 V1.
6.58. Expendables Check. Refer to 193 SOW Sup 1 to this instruction.
6.59. Hot Refueling. Reserved for future use.
6.60. Engine Shutdown.
     6.60.1. Follow TO 1C-130(E)J-1 guidance for engine shutdown restrictions.
     6.60.2. Except for loadmasters performing crew duties, no passenger or crewmember will
     exit the aircraft until completion of the ―Engine Shutdown‖ checklist.
     6.60.3. The complete AFTO Form 781 will normally be reviewed by the maintenance
     debriefer prior to the aircrew departing the aircraft.
6.61. Classified Equipment and Material-Post Flight.
     6.61.1. Clear classified information stored in navigation systems, and mission computers.
     6.61.2. Clear all transmission security systems, such as secure voice and IFF.
     6.61.3. In an emergency, destroy or damage classified material and equipment prior to crash
     landing or bailout, if possible.
6.62. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious incident, the aircraft
commander should impound the aircraft immediately and contact the AFSOC Command Center
or controlling agency for further instructions.
6.63. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment. At stations without maintenance support, when a
maintenance requirement exists, the AC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the C2
agency, and the MAJCOM Logistics Readiness Center is notified prior to entering crew rest.
     6.63.1. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required maintenance inspections. In
     those instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red
     dash symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, updating current status, and enter a red dash symbol
     and a discrepancy that reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e., preflight,
     thru-flight, basic post-flight) is overdue.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                81


   6.63.2. The AC reviews the AFTO 781, determines those discrepancies considered as
   mission essential and indicates them by entering ―ME‖ in block letters in the lower left hand
   corner of the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. Use ―MC‖ to indicate any discrepancies
   that, if corrected, would substantially contribute to mission accomplishment, but are not
   mission essential.
   6.63.3. Ensure fuel on-loaded or off-loaded during refueling is entered in the AFTO Form
   781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance.
6.64. Intelligence. Debrief intelligence when applicable.
6.65. Crew Debriefing. The AC will conduct a debriefing after each mission. The debriefing
will include all applicable crewmembers so that common problems can be discussed and
resolved. Crewmembers may be excused from the debriefing at the discretion of the AC.
6.66. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the AC will establish a
point of contact with the command post, base operations, or local airport manager, when the
crew is billeted in off-base quarters. The AC will be notified immediately in case of incident or
emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft.
6.67. Border Clearance and Inspections. IAW the FCG.
6.68. Insect and Pest Control. IAW the FCG.
6.69. Hazardous Medical Equipment:
   6.69.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities using AFSOC air evacuation
   services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment are of major
   concern:
       6.69.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference which is
       commonly beyond the limits specified by MILSTD461A and 462, and therefore can
       interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
       6.69.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
       A potential but real hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
       regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.69.2. Nonstandard electronic and oxygen equipment must be listed by manufacturer and
   model number in the current ―Status Report on Medical Material Items Tested and Evaluated
   for use in the USAF Aeromedical Evacuation System, USAFSAM, Brooks AFB, TX.
   6.69.3. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.69.3.1. Para-rescue personnel must inform the AC when nonstandard electronic
       medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
       6.69.3.2. The AC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment
       during the mission.
       6.69.3.3. The AC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communication or
       navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
       6.69.3.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
       the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
82                                                       AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


        additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
        navigational equipment.
     6.69.4. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
        6.69.4.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
        manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
        and lateral axes.
        6.69.4.2. Para-rescue personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment
        to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.
6.70. Hazardous Material Procedures. IAW AFJI 11-204.
6.71. Dropped Object Procedure. If an external object is dropped, the flight crew will notify
the controlling agencies as soon as practical; include routing, altitude, weather, etc. Notify
maintenance at the first military station transited. Record the coordinates where the object was
dropped.
6.72. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting strange airfields or airfields where conditions
may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
     6.72.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
     slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
     contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc.
     6.72.2. Debrief the next C2 agency transited.
6.73. Clearwater Rinse Facility (birdbath) Usage Guidelines.
     6.73.1. Crews should use a clear water rinse facility (birdbath) after every flight in which the
     aircraft is flown over salt water below 1000‘ AGL, including tactical approaches and
     landings. Multiple instrument approaches do not require a clear water rinse, unless, in the
     judgment of the crew, the aircraft was subjected to salt spray. If a birdbath facility is
     unavailable make the following annotation in the AFTO form 781A, " aircraft subjected to
     salt spray, birdbath unavailable." The following guidance will be used to maximize the
     effectiveness of the birdbath and to ensure safe operations.
     6.73.2. Crews will ensure that the radar is off prior to entering the birdbath.
     6.73.3. The APU will remain off with doors closed.
     6.73.4. Set flaps to 100% and extend both landing lights.
     6.73.5. Two engines in normal ground idle, and two in LSGI should be used if aircraft
     weight does not restrict the forward movement through the bath.
     6.73.6. Complete the "AFTER LANDING CHECKLIST" after rinse is completed, run
     engines at normal ground idle for a minimum of two minutes to aid in drying out engine
     nacelles.
     6.73.7. Review local procedures for birdbath operating guidelines. Each birdbath is unique
     in design and function and local procedures such as direction of entry, wing tip clearance
     criteria, noise abatement concerns, etc.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                             83


CAUTION: It is possible to experience some type of overheat indication during or immediately
following the birdbath due to water intrusion in the over heat warning systems. Each crew will
have to analyze the indication and make a judgment as to the emergency action taken.
6.74. Suspected Laser Exposure. If exposed to a laser, the aircraft commander will ensure
appropriate command and control, intelligence, safety, and medical agencies are notified as soon
as possible. Aircrew who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or hostile
sources should report to the Flight Surgeons Office or nearest emergency room where the
individual can be examined by an ophthalmologist immediately upon landing. Reference AFI
11-301 Vol 4 for further guidance.

                                            Chapter 7

                                     AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security, in-flight and on the ground.
Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking. Resistance may vary
from dissuasion to direct physical confrontation, including the use of weapons. Due to the
sensitive nature of antihijacking procedures, crewmembers should reference AFI 13-207,
Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (For Official Use Only [FOUO]) and the FIH for
specific guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or
identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. EC-130J aircraft are Protection Level ―C‖ resources. This security priority
designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located, worldwide. Some aircraft
contain equipment and documents that require protection per DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401,
Information Security Program Management.
7.3. Procedures. The planning agency must ensure that adequate en route force protection is
available. The amount of force protection required will vary, depending on location and ground
time. The AC will receive a threat assessment and force protection capability evaluation briefing
at home station prior to departure and receive updates en route, if required. During both
scheduled and unscheduled landings at non-USAF installations, the AC will assess the force
protection situation and take the following actions, if force protection capability appears
insufficient:
     7.3.1. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-
     up response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF IMT Form
     15, USAF Invoice.
     7.3.2. Aircrew Surveillance. Direct armed personnel to remain with the aircraft and
     maintain surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the aircraft.
     Obtain a means to report suspicious or hostile activity to security forces (e.g., land mobile
     radio, etc.).
     7.3.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or unavailable
     and the crew is not augmented with security forces, the PIC may waive FDP restrictions and
     depart as soon as possible for a destination with adequate force protection. If unable to
     depart the location due to system malfunction, coordinate through home station channels to
     acquire force protection support.
     7.3.4. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the ACs judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
     sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:
        7.3.4.1. Use the aircraft lock.
NOTE: The aircraft will be locked during all off-station missions remaining overnight.
        7.3.4.2. If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that
        will indicate unauthorized entry. For example, tape inside hatch release handles to the
        airframe, so that entry pulls the tape loose. Close and seal the main crew entrance door
        or left troop door using a metal boxcar seal or other controllable device to identify forced
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               85


       entry. Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry. If
       the seals are damaged or have been tampered with, notify the appropriate local
       authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
       7.3.4.3. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
       servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
       will be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
       personnel.
7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors. This paragraph
applies specifically to aircraft transporting DVs Code 4 or above. PICs are responsible for
aircraft security at en route stops.
   7.4.1. DoD Installations. Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
   times. Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the
   installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   7.4.2. Non-DoD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
   arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
   using AF IMT Form 15.
7.5. Arming of Crewmembers. When directed, two loadmasters will carry weapons.
   7.5.1. Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crewmembers will obtain weapons,
   ammunition, lock, and key. Crewmembers must present a current AF Form 523, USAF
   Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crewmembers will be reissued the
   same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crewmember must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crewmember, using AF
   IMT Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the weapon
   on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the
   identity of armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and from
   the Command and Control Center, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew
   activities such as base operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line
   cafeterias, snack bars, etc.
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage In-flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight
   or onload duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check,
   weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight. Crewmembers will rearm before landing.
   Weapons need not be unloaded before being placed in the gun box.
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available,
   normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country
   prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
   7.5.6. Aircraft Without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain overnight
   at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest
   acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military services armories
   US National Guard and Reserve armories, and US civil law enforcement armories. If none
86                                                     AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     of these are available, or the PIC believes weapons security may be compromised,
     crewmembers may secure their weapons in their quarters, but one crewmember must remain
     with the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the ammunition over to the AC.
7.6. General Hijacking Guidance. The hijacking of an AFSOC aircraft could create a serious
international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is most
vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be
dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals
for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been
most successful in saving lives and property. Crews must resist all attempts to hijack their
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple discouragement to direct physical attack with
weapons. Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the
problem.
     7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting
     facility should conduct antihijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the aircraft
     commander is fully satisfied with these inspections. Supporting/supported forces may be
     antihijack-inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew.
     7.6.2. Aeromedical Procedures. Military medical facility commanders are responsible for
     the antihijacking inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by
     civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.
     7.6.3. Contingency and Exercise Movements. During contingencies in support of combat
     operations involving the movement of large numbers of personnel and exercises, the
     supported unit should manifest passengers and perform antihijacking inspections.
     7.6.4. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their
     person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft except special agents and guards of
     the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry
     weapons.
        7.6.4.1. Take every precaution to prevent accidental discharge of weapons.                If
        individuals must clear their weapons, ask them to:
            7.6.4.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
            personnel before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
            7.6.4.1.2. Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedure.
        7.6.4.2. Troops and deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
        aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
        weapons and ammunition on board the aircraft during combat operations. When the
        situation dictates, weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or team
        leader.
7.7. Specific Hijacking Guidance. It is imperative that all crewmembers are familiar with the
ground and in-flight resistance actions, covert communications, and forced penetration of
unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207 and the FIH. In the event of a hijacking,
crewmembers must act immediately and resourcefully, without instruction, in order to counter
the attacker successfully.

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms.              For
assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing, unit, or local flight safety officer.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. Reference AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program. AF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force personnel to
alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt corrective action. A
hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may jeopardize the health and

Program RSC: HAF-SE (AR) 7602.
   8.3.1. The Air Force HATR program provides a means for personnel to report all near
   midair collisions (NMAC) and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. Use information in
   HATR reports only for mishap prevention. AFI 91-202 lists reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. Reporting Procedures:
       8.3.2.1. Anyone aware of a reportable incident files a HATR, RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602.
       8.3.2.2. Report the details on AF Form 651 within 24 hours to the base safety office if
       you are at the Air Force base where the incident occurred. Submit the form to the nearest
       US Air Force Base Safety Office after landing if the incident occurred during flight.
       Base operations may be able to provide assistance. Unit commanders will ensure AF
       Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), is available to aircrew at base
       operations facilities, flying squadron operations offices, in trip kits, and in US Air Force
       air traffic control facilities.
   8.3.2.3. If you have a NMAC, inform the nearest air traffic control agency or flight service
   station and provide the following information:
           8.3.2.3.1. Your identification or call sign.
           8.3.2.3.2. Time and place (name of NAVAID, radial, and distance) of the incident.
           8.3.2.3.3. Altitude or flight level.
           8.3.2.3.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
           8.3.2.3.5. Advise the agency that you intend to file a written Near Midair Collision

        8.3.3.3. No mishap occurred.
        8.3.3.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
NOTE: HATR reports are not privileged information and may be released outside the USAF.
8.4. AF Form 711B, Aircraft Flight Mishap Report.
     8.4.1. Responsibilities. Notify the appropriate authorities of any mishap involving aircraft or
     crew. When notified, AFSOC units will initiate investigative and reporting actions in
     accordance with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reporting, and OPREP-3.
NOTE: Do not attempt to classify a mishap.
8.5. Reports of Violations/Unusual Events or Circumstances. Violations identified in AFI
11-202V3, General Flight Rules, alleged navigation errors (including over-water position errors
exceeding 24 NMs, border and air traffic control violations) will be reported. ACs must keep
appropriate MAJCOM agencies apprised of any unusual events or circumstances impacting their
missions. When in doubt, report such events to the MAJCOM.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants – Aviation Fuels Documentation. Several different
forms are used to record aviation fuels transactions, depending on where the actual refueling
takes place. Basically, these transactions can be broken down into two categories: Refueling at
USAF locations and refueling at other than USAF bases:
     8.6.1. Refueling at USAF Locations. AF Form 1994, Fuels Issue/Defuel Document, is used
     to record the Aviation Fuels Transaction (issue or defuel) at USAF locations.
     8.6.2. Refueling at locations other than USAF bases:
        8.6.2.1. DD Form 1898, AvFuels Into-Plane Sales Slip. This form is used to record the
        aviation fuels transaction (issue or defuel) at other DOD locations (United States Army,
        United States Navy, and United States Marine Corp) and at commercial airports where
        into-plane contracts are in force.
        8.6.2.2. AF Form 315, United States Air Force AvFuels Invoice. This form is used to
        purchase aviation fuels and oils at commercial locations where into-plane contracts are
        not in force. The form is filled in by the AC or his authorized representative and is
        described in AFI 23-206. If the vendor wants to be paid without submitting an invoice,
        the AC retains the original AF Form 315 to return to home station for accounting and
        finance processing. Provide two legible copies of the form to the vendor. If the vendor
        wants to submit an invoice for payment, give the vendor the original AF Form 315 to
        attach to the invoice.
NOTE: Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement Card. The Aircard is a commercial credit card
which allows aircrews to purchase aviation fuel, fuel related supplies, and/or ground services at
commercial airports where no DoD/Canadian into-plane contracts exist. Accepted at over 4200
locations, it is intended to replace the AF Form 315 and AF Form 15 at locations that accept the
Aircard.
8.7. AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice. Used to purchase ground fuels, oils, or
services at non-DoD activities. When completed, log and place inside AF Form 664, Aircraft
Fuels/Ground Servicing Documentation Log.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                             89


   8.7.1. Use the AF Form 15 for vendor services/supplies only if contract vendors are not
   available or the contract vendor will not accept the aircraft identiplate.
   8.7.2. If the vendors require a signature on their form and an AF Form 15 has been used,
   write the statement "AF Form 15 Executed" on the vendor's form.
   8.7.3. Return two copies of the AF Form 15 to the operations officer at home station.
   8.7.4. Purchases at Canadian into-plane locations will be documented using the local
   vendor's invoice. AF Form 15 or 315 will not be accomplished. Hand scribe the information
   from the aircraft identiplate to the vendor's invoice, and complete a separate sheet with the
   information listed on the Aviation Issues to DoD and Non-DoD, Aircraft Refueling Tender
   Sheet. Log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664.
   8.7.5. Purchases at SITCO Agreement locations require presenting the aircraft identiplate.
   The invoice must include the date of transaction, grade of the product, quantity issued or
   defueled, unit of measure, and signature of the Air Force representative. If the vendor also
   requires completion of an AF Form 15 or 315 in addition to their invoice, annotate on the
   vendor's invoice "AF FORMS EXECUTED." Log and place the documentation inside the
   AF Form 664.
   8.7.6. Purchases at non-contract commercial airfields are accomplished using the AF Form
   15 or 315.
   8.7.7. Purchases at foreign military airfields, including Replacement-in-Kind locations, the
   host country forms are used to record the purchase. Information from the aircraft identiplate
   should be hand scribed on the local form. Log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664.
8.8. AF Form 853, Bird Strike Report. Submit this report upon destruction of a winged
creature via aircraft.

                                 NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General Information. All EC-130J Commando Solo and Super J Pilots and FSO will use
flight planning, navigation procedures and forms prescribed by this instruction, as well as
AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo. Any reference to the EC-130J aircraft in this chapter is applicable
to CS, Super J (SJ), and Super J Supported Missions operations unless otherwise specified.
11.2. General Flight Planning Forms/Requirements.
     11.2.1. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is furnished by
     another agency, the aircraft commander will verify the information. Crosscheck the planned
     route of flight against the route entered on the DD Form 175, DD Form 1801, or ICAO flight
     plan. Check RVSM airspace on the United States NOTAM Office website, in applicable
     FLIP Area Planning publications, and FCIFs for restrictions applicable to flight planning.
     Verify the current aircraft communication and navigation equipment configuration and
     ensure flight plan equipment codes are entered in accordance with FLIP.
     11.2.2. Category I Routes to include Required Navigation Performance (RNP) airspace.
     Master Flight Plan (MFP). The AF Form 4138, or an approved Computer Flight Plan (CFP)
     generated facsimile will be used to plan all EC-130J flights that include Category 1 route
     segments of 4 hours or more. The MFP is normally maintained by the PM but should be kept
     readily available to both pilots. The MFP must be retained for a period of 90 days following
     the mission.
     11.2.3. Category II Routes including Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) airspace. Use the AF
     Form 70, AF Form 4138, or a CFP generated facsimile.
     11.2.4. Ensure all required fuel computations are accurate and complete, and confirm the
     ramp fuel load is compatible with mission requirements in accordance with procedures
     outlined in AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo using the AF Form 4138, AF Form 4139, or
     approved CFP fuel analysis procedures, as applicable. Not required for local area flights.
11.3. Computer Flight Planning.
     11.3.1. As with any computer-generated mission-planning product, the AC is always
     responsible for the accuracy of data used in-flight. Computer flight plans will be verified for
     correctness prior to each flight.
     11.3.2. The flight planning computer configuration is approved by 193rd Operations Support
     Flight/Operations Support Flight (Tactics) and the flight planning forms are approved by 193
     OG/OGV.
11.4. Navigation Chart Requirements.
     11.4.1. Category II Routes. Aircraft Digital Map (DIGIMAP) data is sufficient to meet the
     requirements for this paragraph. If aircraft DIGIMAP is unavailable, use applicable charts
     suitable for flight following (JNCA scale or larger). Use a terrain chart (ONC scale or larger)
     depicting all terrain in the terminal area (within 25NM of the airfield).
EXCEPTION: For combat and contingency operations, printed charts are always required.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   97


   11.4.2. For all combat and contingency operations, a minimum of three sets of printed charts
   will be constructed in sufficient detail to meet the needs of the Pilots, FSO, and MSO.
   11.4.3. Category 1 Navigation Requirement. Construct a Master Plotting Chart (MPC). A
   crewmember will plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate chart. This chart
   will be used to plot aircraft position in-flight. If a revised clearance is received in-flight, the
   new points will be plotted on the MPC. The MPC must be retained for a period of 90 days
   following the mission. The MPC will include the following information:
       11.4.3.1. Name and coordinated universal date in the vicinity of departure or coast out
       point.
       11.4.3.2. Chart number(s), and chart edition(s) will be annotated on the front or back of
       all charts.
       11.4.3.3. The flight plan reporting points, centerline course, and portions of ADIZ and
       Flight Information Region boundaries pertinent to the route. Label reporting points with
       proper names or geographical coordinates.
       11.4.3.4. Place the applicable portion of ―No Fly‖ areas on all charts used for missions
       flown in the vicinity of unfriendly territory. Prominently mark warning and restricted
       areas within 25 Nautical Mile (nm) of planned course and 3000 feet of planned altitude
       on the chart (not required if a FLIP en route chart with this information is immediately
       available and used).
       11.4.3.5. Annotate in-flight refueling abort and emergency landing areas along the
       planned route. Consider the following factors when selecting emergency airfields: Type
       aircraft, weather conditions, runway length, runway weight-bearing capacity, runway
       lighting, radio navigational aids, and proximity to planned flight path.
11.5. Navigation/Communication           System         Certifications. The        EC-130J
navigation/communication system is capable of meeting the following Air Traffic Management
(ATM) initiatives and RNP standards.
   11.5.1. BRNAV.
   11.5.2. RNP – 10.
   11.5.3. TCAS – 7.
   11.5.4. VOR-FM Immunity.
   11.5.5. VHF-8.33 kHz spacing.
11.6. Specific Navigation System Certification Information. In addition to the information
contained in the following subparagraphs, also refer to the navigation system performance
requirements located in the Flight Information Planning document to include GP and applicable
area planning sections for the route structures in the intended areas of operation.
   11.6.1. The GPS currently installed in the C-130J navigation suite does not meet FAA
   certification requirements for IFR navigation. However, IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFSOC has
   endorsed the use of the GPS as a mission enhancement aid.
   11.6.2. CAT II routes (not including operations in BRNAV airspace).
98                                                    AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


        11.6.2.1. The EGI or GPS can be used as a controlling solution for en route instrument
        navigation if NAVAIDS are available for monitoring. The NAVAIDs must be
        operational and actively monitored. If deviations are observed, crews should revert to
        navigation via ground based NAVAIDs.
        11.6.2.2. Configure the CNI-MS as follows for basic CAT II routes. Set the INAV
        Position Alert 1 to 1.0 nm and INAV Position Alert 2 to 5.0 nm on the CNI Progress 2/3
        page.
     11.6.3. BRNAV Route.
        11.6.3.1. Airspace where BRNAV applies is considered special qualification airspace.
        Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these
        areas. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5. The EC-130J is approved for
        BRNAV operations when the following conditions are met.
        11.6.3.2. Crews must be especially aware of BRNAV tolerances on flights entering
        BRNAV airspace after long overwater flights, and if required update the navigation
        system prior to BRNAV airspace entry.
        11.6.3.3. For BRNAV operations the aircrew will select Inertial Navigation System
        (INS)/Radar (RAD) or INS-only as the controlling solution and monitor the system
        performance using the offside EGI or INS as an independent navigation source, with the
        following restrictions.
            11.6.3.3.1. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace with no time
            restriction is one fully functional INS/RADIO (INS/RAD) solution with
            AUTOTUNE enabled and selected. The EGI or GPS cannot be used as a controlling
            solution in BRNAV airspace, even when using INS as the sole input source for the
            EGI.
            11.6.3.3.2. Should NAVAIDs become unavailable, either through radio failure or
            denial, the INS-only solution will maintain BRNAV accuracy for 2.6 hours (from the
            time the INSs were commanded to the NAV mode).
        11.6.3.4. Configure the CNI-MS as follows. Set the INAV Position Alert 1 to 1.0 nm
        and INAV Position Alert 2 to 5.0 nm on the CNI Progress 2/3 page.
        11.6.3.5. Aircraft unable to maintain BRNAV tolerances must advise ATC immediately
        and take appropriate coordination actions.
        11.6.3.6. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of BRNAV required
        equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet BRNAV tolerances.
     11.6.4. CAT I Routes (not including operations in RNP airspace). The following
     procedures apply to basic Category I route operations unless more restrictive procedures are
     identified for specific ATM initiatives.
        11.6.4.1. As a minimum, both EGI systems, which includes GPS and INS inputs, are
        required.
        11.6.4.2. On CAT I routes (not including operations in RNP airspace), the EGI or GPS
        may be used as the controlling solution providing the aircrew can monitor its
        performance using the offside INS as an independent navigation source.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                           99


       11.6.4.3. Configure the CNI-MS as follows. Set the INAV Position Alert 1 to 4.0 nm
       and INAV Position Alert 2 to 8.0 nm on the CNI Progress 2/3 page.
   11.6.5. RNP-10 procedures.
       11.6.5.1. RNP-10 certification for the EC-130J is based on raw INS data. The EGI or
       GPS cannot be used as a controlling solution in RNP-10 airspace, even when using INS
       as the sole input source for the EGI.
       11.6.5.2. RNP-10 compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM of actual
       position 95% of the time. EC-130J aircraft are qualified for flight in RNP-10 airspace
       when the following conditions are met:
          11.6.5.2.1. Prior to entering RNP-10 airspace, both INS along with the EGI systems
          must be fully operational.
          11.6.5.2.2. The aircrew will use an INS as the controlling INAV solution and
          monitor the controlling INS performance using the offside INS or EGI as an
          independent navigation source.
          11.6.5.2.3. Configure the CNI-MS as follows. Set the INAV Position Alert 1 to 4.0
          nm and INAV Position Alert 2 to 8.0 nm on the CNI Progress 2/3 page.
          11.6.5.2.4. EC-130J aircraft are limited to a maximum of 10.4 hours of operation in
          RNP-10 airspace without an INS update, beginning when the INS enters the
          navigation mode after a full Gyro-Compass (GC) ground alignment. The GC
          alignment may be initiated either automatically by selecting AUTONAV on the CNI-
          MU Power Up page to initiate an EGI alignment or manually using the INS 1/2
          Alignment functions accessed from the CNI-MU INDEX pages.
          11.6.5.2.5. The clock can be reset for an additional 10.4 hours maximum, following
          an In-Flight Alignment of an INS.
          11.6.5.2.6. Because the GPS receivers in the EGIs do not incorporate Receiver
          Autonomous Integrity Monitoring, if an in-flight alignment is used to reset the 10.4
          hour clock, it may only be conducted on one INS at a time and within coverage of a
          NAVAID. The resulting alignment must provide a position that agrees with the
          position provided by the Radio-NAVAID within 0.3 nm. After verifying the position
          accuracy of the first INS alignment, the second INS may be in-flight aligned.
          Compare its position to the first INS, or to the NAVAID.
       11.6.5.3. Advise ATC when the aircraft does not meet this requirement prior to entering
       RNP-10 airspace and obtain a clearance to return to the nearest maintenance repair
       facility or refile the flight plan via a non-RNP route.
11.7. Back-up hand-held GPS Requirement. A Portable GPS Unit (PGU) is required on all
missions transiting a category 1 route segment of 4 hours or more. The operation of a PGU on
the EC-130J will be in compliance with all guidance as outlined in AFI11-202V3, applicable
supplement.
   11.7.1. Before using a PGU in-flight, aircrew members must receive training.
   11.7.2. Only PGUs certified by the AF for in-flight use will be used.
100                                                    AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


   11.7.3. When unit aircraft deploy, there will be a PGU for each deployed aircraft.
   11.7.4. The use of any PGU is restricted to operation above 10,000 ft AGL only.
   11.7.5. The PGU will not be used as a primary navigation system or to update any aircraft
   navigation system. The PGU is intended for use as only a back-up system while on category
   1 route segments in the event the a primary aircraft navigation system failure, i.e., INU and
   GPS.
   11.7.6. Only PGU navigation functions to include position, ground speed, true or magnetic
   ground track, and course information referenced to manually entered waypoint data will be
   used.
11.8. Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace. For flights in
MNPS airspace in the North Atlantic Region, Pacific Organized Track system, or the Composite
Hawaii/Mainland US Route Systems, the following minimum operable navigation systems are
mandatory:
NOTE: ATC uses the same reporting and investigating criteria for gross navigational errors that
occur below as well as within MNPS airspace.
   11.8.1. Prior to entering MNPS airspace, both EGI navigation systems must be fully
   operational. Advise ATC when the aircraft does not meet this requirement and obtain a
   clearance to return to the nearest maintenance repair facility or re-file the flight plan via non-
   MNPS routes specified in FLIP.
   11.8.2. After entering MNPS airspace, flight may be continued with a minimum of only one
   functional EGI system, which includes both GPS and INS inputs, or two functional INS.
   Advise ATC when the aircraft does not meet this requirement, and expect either a rerouting
   to non-MNPS airspace or a clearance to return to the nearest maintenance repair facility.
   11.8.3. Equipment listed in FLIP is mandatory for compliance with MNPS. Loss of any
   required component before track entry requires returning to a station with maintenance
   capability or refiling via routes specified in FLIP AP/2.
11.9. North Pacific Region (NOPAC). Minimum MNPS airspace. For flights in NOPAC
MNPS airspace comply with the following additional procedures when transiting the
Anchorage/Tokyo Oceanic Control Area /First-Impressions Report; Flight Information Region
on the NOPAC North route. The following minimum operable navigation systems are
mandatory:
   11.9.1. Prior to entering the NOPAC North route, the radar and both EGI navigation systems
   must be fully operational.
   11.9.2. After entering the NOPAC North route:
       11.9.2.1. Aircraft on the NOPAC North route may continue without functional radar, if
       radar is not required for weather avoidance, as long as both EGI systems are fully
       functional to include GPS and INS inputs. If the EGI accuracy cannot be determined,
       either re-file a flight plan on another track (fuel permitting) or return to the nearest
       facility possessing maintenance capability.
       11.9.2.2. Aircraft on the NOPAC North route may continue with only one functional
       EGI system, which includes both GPS and INS input, or two functional INS provided the
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                101


       radar system is fully functional. Verify in-flight that satisfactory RADAR returns are
       available on all ranges, particularly the 80, 160, and 320 nm ranges. If the radar system
       is either marginal or inoperative, fuel permitting, re-file a flight plan to another track or
       return to the nearest facility possessing maintenance capability.
       11.9.2.3. Aircraft that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs 11.9.2.1. or 11.9.2.2.
       will return to the nearest maintenance repair facility.
11.10. North Atlantic Tracks (NAT). When flying over the North Atlantic, crews should
obtain a copy of the NAT valid for their coast out time. Until RVSM certification is complete
the EC-130J is not permitted into the NAT system, but can follow track routings below the NAT
altitude structure.

                                          Chapter 12

                       LOADMASTER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

12.1. General. In addition to the duties established in applicable T.O.s and other directives, the
loadmaster will comply with the procedures and duties in this regulation. The aircraft
commander may assign other duties as necessary. The loadmaster will:
   12.1.1. Coordinate loading and offloading with air terminal operations or the shipping
   agency. Plan loads; handle troops and passengers; supervise loading, tie-down, and
   offloading of cargo, baggage, and mission equipment.
   12.1.2. Remain in the cargo/mission compartment when passengers are onboard, and
   provides in-flight services to passengers.
   12.1.3. Perform spotter duties during flight in high threat environments.
   12.1.4. During all airborne refueling operations, one loadmaster will remain in the cargo
   compartment to perform leak check. When a second loadmaster is available, the second
   loadmaster should be on the flight deck to monitor fuel panel, based on the crew complement
   and training requirements.
   12.1.5. When passengers are carried, a loadmaster will be in the cargo/mission compartment
   for takeoffs and landings. When the passenger load requires two loadmasters, then both
   personnel will remain in the cargo compartment. One will remain forward and one aft for
   takeoffs and landings.
   12.1.6. Perform hot refueling supervisor and panel operator duties during hot refueling
   operations.
12.2. Preflight Duties:
   12.2.1. The loadmaster will normally report to the aircraft after signing in and reviewing all
   applicable mission requirements or as directed by the aircraft commander to begin preflight
   and loading duties.
   12.2.2. EC-130J and unit assigned BAI aircraft do not routinely airlift channel cargo;
   however, if so tasked, contact the applicable air terminal controlling agency, or air
   freight/passenger service to obtain the cargo and passenger breakdown and assist in planning
   of proposed load. Security requirements for ammunition and weapons will be briefed to the
   loadmaster during the initial load briefing at the controlling agency.
       12.2.2.1. EC-130J (CS) will not normally accept airlift channel cargo; however, floor
       loaded cargo may be transported to support AFSOC aircraft. Under no circumstances,
       will an EC-130J (CS) be reconfigured while off station to accommodate cargo airlift.
       12.2.2.2. At stations where aircraft tie-down equipment is exchanged, make every effort
       to ensure that a one-for-one exchange occurs. If this is not possible, the loadmaster will
       inform the aircraft commander of lost or missing equipment and document the loss, refer
       to AFTO 781.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               103


12.3. EC-130J Specific Duties:
   12.3.1. Identify threats directed toward the aircraft and coordinate evasive maneuvers with
   the remainder of the flight crew and spotters.
   12.3.2. Operate defensive equipment and direct evasive maneuvers from visual threat
   engagements.
      12.3.2.1. Configure defensive systems equipment, located in the cargo compartment, as
      directed by the FSO.
      12.3.2.2. Identify the type of anti-aircraft threats and locations for real time intelligence
      gathering relative to the mission and follow-on missions.
   12.3.3. Possess a through knowledge of aircraft systems and component locations. Inform
   the crew of malfunctions and systems affected by battle damage. Assist during in-flight
   emergencies and accomplish recommended corrective actions to isolate malfunctions.
   12.3.4. Possess a thorough knowledge of aircraft performance capabilities to assist pilots
   during mission planning.
   12.3.5. Develop and maintain Evasion Plans of Action as required for mission tasking.
   12.3.6. During airborne refueling operations in a hostile environment, one loadmaster will
   perform forward spotter duties and monitor fuel panel. The other loadmaster will perform
   leak check responsibilities and monitor the cargo compartment.
12.4. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for the aircraft IAW T.O. 1-1B-50,
Weight and Balance, C-130J Concept of Operations Annex C, Addenda A, and this instruction.
   12.4.1. A basic handbook of weight and balance, maintained by the unit possessing the
   aircraft, provides supplemental weight and balance information unique to each aircraft.
      12.4.1.1. This supplemental handbook is in a wear-resistant binder (marked with the
      aircraft model and complete serial number on the cover) need not contain T.O. 1-1B-50 if
      a certified copy of the current (last page) DD Form 365-3, Chart C – Basic Weight and
      Balance Record provides the current basic weight, basic moment, and basic index. The
      binder will include the T.O. 1C-130J-5-2 and sufficient copies of the DD Form 365-4 to
      complete the mission.
      12.4.1.2. The unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for providing appropriate
      agencies with information required to keep the weight and balance documents current and
      accurate.
   12.4.2. Compute weight and balance by using the weight and balance pages available thru
   the CNI MU or Chart E mathematical (moments) method. Prepare DD Form 365-4 IAW
   T.O. 1C-130J-5-2 and Addenda A. Ensure that correct weights are loaded into the CNI-MU
   weight and balance pages (INDEX-WT/BAL) and proper weight is entered on the PERF-
   INIT WT page 1/4.
12.5. Fuel Weight Computation. Fuel weight computations will be accomplished using either
of the procedures outlined below.
104                                                    AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


   12.5.1. To compute fuel weight entered on the DD Form 365-4, read directly from each fuel
   gauge and compute the sum for the total fuel weight. Select the correct limiting wing fuel
   area using the charts in T.O. 1C-130(E)J-1 or Addenda A.
   12.5.2. Fuel may also be computed using unit stan/eval approved standard fuel loading
   tables. Moments may be computed using the constant (0.552) method.
12.6. Cargo/Baggage Airlift. When loading items of cargo or baggage on the ramp, ensure the
latrine area remains clear and ramp egress is available.
12.7. Border Clearance. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture require certain forms for
border clearance. The loadmaster will ensure that required forms are contained in the aircraft
mission kit prior to takeoff. Distribute the forms to the crew and ensure their completion prior to
landing and deliver them to the proper persons at enroute and terminating stations. Also comply
with the requirements of this instruction.
NOTE: Ensure sufficient customs forms are available for each passenger. Forms should be
provided by passenger service personnel prior to departure.
12.8. Operational Forms for Loadmasters. Detailed instructions on the preparation,
distribution, and use of the following forms will be found in the governing regulations (where
noted).
   12.8.1. DD Form 2130-2, C-130 A/B/E/H Load Plan.
   12.8.2. DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
   12.8.3. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest (DOD 4500.32R).
   12.8.4. DD Form 1854, US Customs Accompanied Baggage Declaration.
   12.8.5. CF 6059B, US Customs Declaration.
   12.8.6. CF 7507, General Declaration (Outbound/Inbound).
12.9. Responsibilities of Aircraft Cargo Loading.
   12.9.1. Normally all airfreight, fleet service, and servicing personnel are authorized to
   perform assigned duties in all AFSOC aircraft when escorted by an authorized individual.
   Airfreight personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift, prompt
   completion of cargo documentation, palletizing, and movement of cargo to and from the
   aircraft to meet scheduled departures. They will advise the loadmaster of destination, size,
   weight, and type of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper positioning;
   coordinate traffic activities that may affect loading and offloading; and assign sufficient air
   freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Airfreight personnel are responsible for safe
   positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to and from aircraft cargo ramp or
   auxiliary ground loading ramps. Under supervision of the loadmaster, airfreight personnel
   prepare the aircraft for loading or stowing loading equipment if the aircraft is not to be
   reloaded, tie-down, and physically offload cargo. If cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft
   structure are damaged during loading or offloading, or if loading personnel are injured, the
   loadmaster will notify the AC, command post, or terminal operations officer.
   12.9.2. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each load. A consolidated statement
   (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not available due to
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                 105


   a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a cargo listing or floppy
   disks containing manifest information must accompany the load.
   12.9.3. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight; load planning oversized cargo
   and other cargo, preparation of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-
   Transport/Tactical, operation of aircraft equipment; supervision and direction of loading,
   offloading, tie down, and coordination with loading crew supervisor for checking the cargo
   against manifests. The loadmaster is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of
   the aircraft.
   12.9.4. The loadmaster will brief the AC on any hazardous cargo and cargo jettison
   capability prior to engine start.
   12.9.5. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft loadmaster
   and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it will
   compromise flight safety or does not comply with aircraft T.O.s (i.e., center of gravity out of
   limits), or Air Force/MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these
   reasons, all applicable information, to include a copy of the load plan, will be sent thru unit
   stan/eval channels.
   12.9.6. At locations with no air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities in paragraph 12.9.1. and provides sufficient qualified personnel and material
   handling equipment for loading or off-loading. Loadmaster responsibilities and authority are
   the same as described in paragraphs 12.9.3. through 12.9.5.
   12.9.7. The loadmasters are the on-scene experts for load planning and accepting cargo for
   airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the
   loadmaster to use best judgment, based on training, experience, and knowledge, to determine
   the best and safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise, they should seek
   advice of other personnel (i.e., available loadmasters, squadron, group, wing, or MAJCOM
   Standardization personnel).
   12.9.8. During contingency, and airlift missions, the loadmaster can accept DD Form 2133,
   Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment being offered for air
   shipment. The use of this form, validated by two joint inspection signatures (user and
   transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable portions of the T.O. 1C-130J-9CL-
   1. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous materials.
   This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
12.10. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Maintain emergency exits and safety aisles IAW
C-130J Concept of Operations Annex C, Addenda A (to be published as AFI 11-2EC-130JV3,
Addenda A) and this instruction.
   12.10.1. When passengers are seated in side facing seats, the loadmaster will ensure there is
   sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit passenger leg room.
NOTE: All passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not
obstruct the safety aisle. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle way will be
stowed with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   12.10.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops.
   (This does not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for
106                                                  AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


   egress.) Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered as an
   obstruction.
   12.10.3. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, a 30-
   inch space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward litter, occupied seat.
   When the cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, the 30-inch
   spacing is not required.
EXCEPTION: Maintain 30 inch spacing on Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) missions, when
carrying litters.
12.11. Air Cargo Restraint Criteria. Restrain cargo IAW T.O. 1C-130J-9, Cargo Loading
Manual.
12.12. Passenger Missions. AFSOC aircraft will not normally be tasked to support AMC
passenger missions, nor will passengers be manifested or loaded aboard AFSOC aircraft without
the prior approval of the AC or mission commander.
   12.12.1. Prior to releasing seats on the EC-130 and unit assigned BAI aircraft, ensure
   terminal operations passenger handling personnel are aware that passenger comfort latrine
   facilities are extremely limited and of the possibility of an inflight diversion.
   12.12.2. Space-available passengers will not be transported on EC-130J (CS) or Special
   Mission configured EC-130J (SJ) aircraft without approval by the Wing or Group CC, or
   COMAFSOF.
12.13. Passenger Procedures and Handling. The loadmaster(s) will ensure passengers are
properly manifested on the DD Form 2131. Give one copy of the manifest to the aircraft
commander for filing with the flight plan and retain sufficient copies for border clearance. The
loadmaster will complete anti-hijacking requirements IAW this instruction.
   12.13.1. Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage.
       12.13.1.1. Ensure all classified equipment is covered prior to passenger boarding.
       12.13.1.2. Ensure that classified equipment remains covered during the entire mission
       when passengers are onboard and ensure they are denied access to this equipment.
   12.13.2. The loadmaster is the key figure for good passenger relations. Be aware of the
   doubts and fears, which may arise in the minds of passengers and anticipate their questions
   and actions. There are certain rules that should be observed:
       12.13.2.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
       12.13.2.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
       and criticism of other personnel or organizations.
       12.13.2.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
       willingness to help.
   12.13.3. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often
   determine passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are
   individuals; address them collectively only when making announcements.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               107


  12.13.4. Ensure the auxiliary power unit is shut down before boarding passengers unless
  adequate ear protection is provided. A passenger service representative or crew member will
  assist passengers at the bottom of the steps, and the loadmaster will assist in seating
  passengers. Ensure that only adult, English-speaking passengers are seated next to
  emergency exits. Do not seat mothers with infants, children under 15 years old or physically
  challenged persons in seats adjacent to emergency exits. Make every effort to seat families
  together.
  12.13.5. Passengers may hand-carry Department of Transportation approved infant car seats
  (ICSs). These seats will be secured to a seat using the seat belt. Adults will not hold infant
  seats during any phase of flight.
  12.13.6. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor must
  provide their own approved ICS. If the mission aircraft is equipped with aft facing "airline
  style seats" no further action is required. However, if the aircraft is configured with side
  facing seats crews must ensure that the ICS is adequately secured. The design of the sidewall
  seatbelt makes it difficult to remove enough slack to secure the ICS. Crewmembers may
  need to reroute the seatbelt by crossing the belt, between the sidewall and the seatback
  webbing, routing the belt back through the webbing and through the securing point on the
  ICS. When removing slack from the seatbelt, ensure the buckle remains on one side or the
  other so that it can be easily accessed for release. If, in the opinion of the AC, the ICS cannot
  be adequately secured, the passenger and the car seat will not be transported on that mission.
  12.13.7. Enroute and Post-Flight Passenger Procedures.
     12.13.7.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
     judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
     one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
     concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep on cargo or
     baggage.
     12.13.7.2. Make frequent checks on the following:
         12.13.7.2.1. Cabin temperature.
         12.13.7.2.2. Passengers with small children.
         12.13.7.2.3. Cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
     12.13.7.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment. Passengers
     will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
     12.13.7.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means
     to make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
     12.13.7.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the AC. Use
     good judgment when requesting this authority.
     12.13.7.6. Sponsors must accompany children under 15 at all times during the flight.
     12.13.7.7. When passengers are carried, a loadmaster will be in the cargo compartment
     for all takeoffs and landings. When more than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried
     (except during unit moves or contingencies), two loadmasters will be in the cargo
108                                                  AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


       compartment. Both crew members must remain in the cargo compartment, one forward
       and one aft for takeoffs and landings.
       12.13.7.8. Assist passengers to deplane. If DVs or couriers are aboard, the loadmaster
       will inform the protocol or traffic representative.
12.14. Troop Movements. Most personnel carried aboard AFSOC aircraft are aboard to
perform a specific mission. Every effort should be made to advise them of mission progress and
deviations. The troop commander should be identified prior to boarding.
   12.14.1. Determine if the troop commander has any special requirements prior to departure,
   and advise the aircraft commander of these requirements, if appropriate.
   12.14.2. Determine if specific communications requirements exist and coordinate these
   requirements with the aircraft commander.
   12.14.3. If troops require access to classified equipment during the mission, the requirement
   should be made known to the aircraft commander prior to the mission.
12.15. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. The following procedures will apply to ensure a safe,
efficient loading method for the emergency airlift of personnel from areas faced with enemy
siege, hostile fire, for humanitarian reasons, or when directed by the C2 agency having
operational control.
   12.15.1. Emergency airlift normally will be accomplished without the use of individual seats
   or safety belts. The number of personnel seated on the cargo compartment floor will vary
   depending on individual size. Ambulatory combat floor loading will not be performed on
   non-combat missions.
   12.15.2. General Procedures:
       12.15.2.1. When available, mattresses or other cushioning material may be used for
       seating.
       12.15.2.2. Seat troops, passengers, and ambulatory patients facing forward.
       12.15.2.3. Attach a tie-down strap for each row of personnel to provide forward restraint
       and body stability.
   12.15.3. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL 250.
12.16. Passenger Weapons Handling. Magazines or clips will not be inserted into passenger
weapons since weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the weapon.
This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty. Store all ammunition for passenger‘s
weapons in a centralized location for redistribution after arrival at destination.
12.17. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) on aircraft in conjunction
with the sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DOD-R 4515.13.

                        SPECIAL OPERATIONS AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-56B, Air-to-Air Refueling, provides the basic
guidance for refueling terminology and procedures. This provides expanded guidance for the
receiver.
15.2. Policy. The following policies apply to all air refueling conditions regardless of emission
control or type of rendezvous:
   15.2.1. AR will only be accomplished by an AR qualified pilot, or a pilot in training under
   the supervision of an instructor. Unqualified pilots, undergoing AR training, must inform the
   tanker prior to completing any contacts and receive an acknowledgment.
   15.2.2. Use manual boom latching procedures only during fuel emergencies and contingency
   operations.
NOTE: Manual boom latching procedures are authorized for all AR operations with the KC-
10A if the tanker‘s independent disconnect system is operational.
   15.2.3. During aerial refueling missions, fuel will not be onloaded with an inoperative drain
   pump.
   15.2.4. Do not make any HF radio transmissions or Electronic Counter Measures emissions
   during AR operations.
15.3. Special Operations Procedures:
   15.3.1. Lighting:
       15.3.1.1. Tanker lighting:

           15.3.1.1.3. Under wing illumination lights-bright.
           15.3.1.1.4. All lights will remain bright until the receiver is approaching the pre-
           contact position. At this time, director lights and under wing illumination lights will
           go to the normal refueling position and boom nozzle lights to low. Tail mounted
           flood light may be used in normal operation. All remaining lights will remain off,
           safety permitting.
       15.3.1.2. Receiver Lighting:
           15.3.1.2.1. Slipway lights – bright or as directed.
           15.3.1.2.2. Area lights – bright or as directed.
           15.3.1.2.3. IR rotating beacon/strobes-on or as directed.
           15.3.1.2.4. All other lights will be off, except position lights will be on for training
           missions.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               117


         15.3.1.2.5. All lights will remain bright until the receiver visually acquires the tanker.
         At this time, slipway and area lights will be turned to normal night refueling setting.
         If no ―TALLY HO‖ call is heard and a ―JUDY‖ call is made, rotating beacon will be
         turned off at pre-contact.
  15.3.2. Rendezvous Procedures. Use en route overtaking rendezvous. Both tanker and
  receiver will monitor primary air refueling frequency (secure) 30 minutes prior to the RZCT.
  Limit transmissions to those specified below unless operational requirements dictate
  otherwise.
     15.3.2.1. Tanker:
         15.3.2.1.1. At the entry point, adjust airspeed to 275 Knots Indicated Airspeed
         (KIAS) and ensure external lighting is set.
         15.3.2.1.2. Upon visual contact with the receiver and in a position to complete the
         rendezvous, the tanker boom operator will transmit ―TALLY HO‖ on primary AR
         frequency (secure).
         15.3.2.1.3. If ―JUDY‖ is heard, tanker will slow to AR speed and proceed down
         track. Tanker lead will acknowledge by turning the lower rotating beacon on then off
         (daylight, wing rock). During training and exercises, the tanker will also transmit the
         numeric part of their call sign and altitude (secure). They will switch to plain (non-
         secure) as the receiver approaches pre-contact.
     15.3.2.2. Receiver:
         15.3.2.2.1. At the entry point, the receiver will be at the rendezvous altitude at 215
         KIAS and ensure outside lighting is set. Plan to arrive at the Rendezvous Initial Point
         (RZIP) at the RZCT.
         15.3.2.2.2. Upon hearing the tanker call ―TALLY HO,‖ turn off the IR rotating
         beacon for 10 seconds (daylight, wing rock). During training and exercises, the
         receiver will also transmit the numeric part of their call sign and altitude on primary
         AR frequency (secure). Approaching pre-contact, switch to plain (non-secure).
         15.3.2.2.3. Should the tanker pass the receiver and advance to a position in front of
         the receiver without calling ―TALLY HO,‖ and if the receiver is in position to
         complete the rendezvous, the receiver will transmit ―JUDY‖ on the secure primary
         refueling frequency. The tanker will respond as described in 15.3.2.1.3.
         15.3.2.2.4. The receiver then moves to the pre-contact position and switches to the
         primary refueling frequency (non-secure).
  15.3.3. Control Time Adjustment:
     15.3.3.1. Revised ETA prior to RZIP. If tanker is notified of a revised receiver ETA
     prior to crossing the RZIP, the tanker will adjust timing to arrive at the RZIP at the
     revised RZCT.
     15.3.3.2. Revised ETA after RZIP. If notified after passing the RZIP, the tanker will
     delay at the ARCP or RZIP and adjust timing to make an enroute overtaking rendezvous
     at RZIP based on new RZCT. If the tanker is unable to make the timing at the RZIP they
     will rendezvous at the ARCP using the adjusted ARCT.
118                                                   AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


   15.3.4. Post Strike Rendezvous Procedures. For missions that do not have a firm
   RZCT/ARCT, a control time window will be established. This provides the tanker with a no
   earlier than/No Later Than (NLT) RZCT time for rendezvous. Tankers will arrive at the
   RZIP no later than the earliest possible control time. If there is no receiver, tanker will
   proceed to ARCP and hold using 2-minute legs, left-hand turns. The receiver, when en route
   to AR and NLT 10 minutes from the RZIP, will call the tanker (secure) with the revised
   RZCT. The tanker will adjust orbit to make an enroute overtaking rendezvous at the RZIP at
   the new control time.
   15.3.5. Completion of Refueling:
      15.3.5.1. The tanker will plan to offload the pre-briefed transfer load.
      15.3.5.2. Upon transfer of the planned onload, the receiver will initiate a normal
      disconnect and close the UARRSI door.
      15.3.5.3. If more fuel is required, leave the UARRSI door open and return to the pre-
      contact position.
   15.3.6. Missed Rendezvous. If the rendezvous has not been made as planned, enter a left-
   hand holding pattern at the ARCP and use the following procedures to accomplish the
   rendezvous:
      15.3.6.1. Receiver Procedures for Missed Rendezvous:
          15.3.6.1.1. On arrival at the ARCP, the receiver will enter a left-hand holding
          pattern, adjusting the first pattern so as to arrive back at the ARCP on an 8-minute
          multiple from the ARCT, the ―Rule of Eight.‖ Example: A receiver is on time at the
          RZIP and arrives at the ARCP at the ARCT (0100Z) without hearing ―TALLY HO‖
          (secure) or seeing the tanker. The receiver enters holding, adjusting so as to arrive
          back at the ARCP at the ARCT plus 8 minutes (0108Z, 0116Z, etc.).
          15.3.6.1.2. Maintain 1,000 feet below the refueling altitude.
          15.3.6.1.3. Maintain 215 KIAS until entering holding at the ARCP, then as required.
          15.3.6.1.4. Upon hearing ―TALLY HO‖ (secure), proceed down track and complete
          the rendezvous.
          15.3.6.1.5. If the receiver acquires the tanker and is in a position to complete the
          rendezvous, call ―JUDY‖ (secure) and complete the rendezvous.
      15.3.6.2. Tanker Procedures for Missed Rendezvous:
          15.3.6.2.1. The tanker enters a left-hand holding pattern upon arrival at the ARCP,
          adjusting holding to rendezvous with the receivers based on the rule of eight at the
          ARCP. Rendezvous equipment will not be turned on unless directed by receiver.
          15.3.6.2.2. Maintain refueling altitude.
          15.3.6.2.3. Maintain 275 KIAS.
          15.3.6.2.4. Upon positively identifying the receiver, the tanker will maneuver for
          rendezvous and will call ―TALLY HO‖ (secure) when ready for the receiver. If the
          receiver calls ―JUDY‖ (secure), slow to refueling airspeed and proceed down track.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                           119


15.4. NVG In-Flight Refueling Operations and Limitations. See paragraph 16.9. for
information on NVG low light in-flight refueling rendezvous procedures and limitations.
15.5. Breakaway Procedures:
   15.5.1. Tanker. The tanker will flash the receiver director lights as the primary indication
   for a breakaway. The lower rotating beacon will be turned on as an additional signal. A
   radio call will be used as the last resort. When the tanker is ready to resume refueling the
   lower rotating beacon will be turned off.
   15.5.2. Receiver. Initiate a breakaway when conditions warrant. Resume refueling when
   the tanker is ready.

16.5. NVG Airland Operations General. NVG Airland operations includes NVG ground
operations, NVG takeoff, approach using NVGs, NVG landing and Engine Running Offloads
(EROs) using NVGs.
   16.5.1. Airfield Marking Patterns. All Airfield Marking Patterns are approved IAW AFI
   13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures, provided the crew is thoroughly briefed
   on the lighting/marking patterns to be used.
   16.5.2. Checklist Procedures. Normal checklists will be used for take off, landing and
   touch-and-go landings. The Tactical ERO checklist may be used for engine running
   on/offloads. After using the Tactical ERO checklist, the crew should complete the touch and
   go landing (on the runway) checklist.
   16.5.3. NVG Formation Flight. NVG Formation flight is not authorized.
   16.5.4. Pilot Seating Policy. Pilots may perform NVG takeoffs and NVG landings from
   either seat, when both pilots are NVG Airland qualified.
   16.5.5. Runway Distance Required.
      16.5.5.1. NVG Takeoff. Minimum runway distance required for NVG takeoff is critical
      field length.
      16.5.5.2. NVG Landing. Minimum runway distance required for NVG landing is
      landing distance plus 1000 feet, or IAW with table 5.1 of this regulation, whichever is
      greater.
      16.5.5.3. NVG Touch and go Landings. Minimum runway for flight idle touch-and-go
      NVG landings is 7,000 feet.
   16.5.6. Weather Minimums. Weather will be at or above 300/1 or the lowest minimums
   for a compatible instrument approach.
16.6. Crew Requirements. To perform NVG takeoffs and landings, LM does not need to be
NVG qualified, however, to perform NVG backings or EROs, LM must be NVG qualified.
16.7. NVG Airland Operations SOPs. These SOPs will be used unless, if in the judgment of
the AC, the mission cannot safely be accomplished without deviating from these SOPs. ACs
must be prepared to use their best judgment and Crew Resource Management to address issues
not covered by these SOPs.
   16.7.1. Mission Planning. Thorough mission planning is critical to effective mission
   accomplishment. Mission planning includes the normal preflight planning as well as:
      16.7.1.1. Airfield Coordination.     AC will ensure proper coordination has been
      accomplished with the airfield where NVG Airland ops will occur.
      16.7.1.2. Airfield Study. A pilot will complete a detailed study for obstructions during
      taxi.
      16.7.1.3. Route and Airfield Area Study. FSO, in coordination with the pilots, will
      accomplish a detailed route study and airfield area study.
      16.7.1.4. EC-130J SCA Worksheet. FSO will complete an EC-130J SCA Worksheet.
122                                                  AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010


      16.7.1.5. Calculated Go-Around Timing. FSO will calculate timing from threshold to
      go-around point.
      16.7.1.6. AC Briefing. Conduct the NVG Airland briefing using the appropriate briefing
      guide.
   16.7.2. Taxi Operations. When taxiing on NVGs, extreme caution must be exercised since
   obstacles are hard to see and depth perception is reduced. Use the following procedures to
   ensure obstacle clearance and safe taxi operations:
      16.7.2.1. Use as many NVG equipped scanners as possible.
      16.7.2.2. Reduce taxi speed and monitor closely.
      16.7.2.3. When in doubt, deplane crewmembers to ensure obstacle clearance during taxi.
   16.7.3. NVG Takeoff Procedures.       Conduct NVG takeoffs using normal or instrument
   takeoff procedures.
      16.7.3.1. Both pilots will wear NVGs.
      16.7.3.2. A PFD will be displayed, as a minimum, on HDD #3.
      16.7.3.3. Standard normal takeoff call-outs will be made:
          16.7.3.3.1. PF: ―Setting takeoff power.‖ Called as PM sets takeoff power.
          16.7.3.3.2. PM: ―Takeoff Power set.‖ Called after engine hp reaches takeoff setting.
          16.7.3.3.3. PM: ―70 knots.‖ Called upon reaching 70 knots IAS.
          16.7.3.3.4. PF: ―Pilot/Copilot has the aircraft.‖ Called when PF has the aircraft.
      16.7.3.4. FSO will call ―Clear of terrain‖ upon reaching appropriate altitude.
   16.7.4. NVG Approach/Landing Procedures. FSO will ensure the airfield remains on the
   outer half of the NAV-RADAR display. Both pilots will use the FULL channel of the NAV-
   RADAR display, and MGM mode selected. Use the following mandatory call-outs:
      16.7.4.1. First pilot to visually acquire the runway: ―P/Co-Pilot (CP) has the LZ‖
      16.7.4.2. Second pilot to visually acquire the runway: ―P/CP has the LZ at # o‘clock.‖
      16.7.4.3. Upon reaching 300‘ AGL during NVG approach, the FSO calls: ―300 ft.‖
      16.7.4.4. The FSO will scan the LZ and surrounding area and call either ―LZs Clear‖ or
      specifically identify traffic or obstacles with clock position.‖
      16.7.4.5. Crossing the runway threshold, PM calls ―Hack,‖ and the FSO begins timing
      for go-around timing.
      16.7.4.6. From 50‘ AGL to landing, the FSO calls out ―50, 40, 30, 20, 10‖ while
      referencing the radar altimeter.
   16.7.5. NVG Go-Around. A go-around will be accomplished if:
      16.7.5.1. Sink rate exceeds 1,500 fpm below 100ft AGL (the intent of this limit is to
      prevent excessive sink rate during an NVG landing, which could result in an
      uncontrollable hard landing).
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                              123


      16.7.5.2. PF and PM do not visually acquire the airfield inside of 1 nm from the LZ.
      16.7.5.3. PF will not land within a safe touchdown zone (go-around timing expired).
      16.7.5.4. Any crewmember determines that the LZ is not clear.
      16.7.5.5. Any crewmember calls for a go-around.
16.8. NVG Airland Operations Emergency Procedures. During all NVG takeoffs and
landings, the PM must be prepared to assume aircraft control at all times.
   16.8.1. Suspected NVG Failure. Battery failure is not considered NVG failure. Therefore,
   the first step during suspected NVG failure is to switch to the alternate power source for the
   NVGs. If time and conditions permit, a pilot who experiences NVG failure should switch to
   the spare set of NVGs.
   16.8.2. PF HUD Failure during NVG Takeoff.
      16.8.2.1. Prior to ―GO‖ call: PF may reject or continue the takeoff using the PFD.
      16.8.2.2. After the ―GO‖ call: PF will either transfer aircraft control to PM or continue
      the takeoff using the PFD.
   16.8.3. PF NVG Failure during NVG Takeoff.
      16.8.3.1. Prior to ―GO‖ call: PF may reject the takeoff or transfer aircraft control to PM.
      16.8.3.2. After the ―GO‖ call: PF will either transfer aircraft control to PM or continue
      the takeoff using the PFD.
NOTE: For the following Emergency Procedure‘s, ―DURING LANDING‖ conveys that the
aircraft is within 2 nm of the airfield.
   16.8.4. PF HUD Failure during NVG Landing. PF may continue to the landing, transfer
   aircraft control to PM, or execute a go-around.
   16.8.5. PF NVG Failure during NVG Landing. After confirming actual NVG failure by PF,
   transfer aircraft control to the PM. If PM is not prepared to assume aircraft control or is not
   able to safely transition to flying the aircraft, PF will execute an immediate go-around.
16.9. NVG In-Flight Refueling Operations and Limitations.
   16.9.1. In-flight refueling and rendezvous weather requirements published in applicable in-
   flight refueling directives apply to NVG low light in-flight refueling rendezvous procedures.
   16.9.2. Both pilots will have NVGs available for immediate use. The NVG rendezvous may
   be accomplished with one or both pilots on NVGs until reaching the pre-contact position.
   NVGs will not be used as an in-flight refueling aid by either pilot when cleared in from the
   pre-contact position and/or during contacts.

                                          Chapter 17

          SELF CONTAINED APPROACH PLANNING AND PROCEDURES

17.1. General. The following SCA procedures will be used to plan a SCA and accomplish
airborne directed approaches to conventional airfields for either overt or covert Airland
operations with or without NVGs. Comply with local ATC restrictions and host nation
agreements. An SCA can be accomplished using both the LZ or the Integrated Precision Radar
Approach (IPRA) function of the EC-130J CNI-MS. See AFTTP 3-3.Commando Solo for
specific techniques and procedures for SCAs.
17.2. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) Approved SCA Procedures. The
following SCA procedures are approved for IMC in the EC-130J. These procedures may only be
used in IMC when approved by the MAJCOM/A3. All training SCA procedures must be flown
in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).
   17.2.1. NIMA-published SCA and Airborne Radar Approach (ARA) procedures.
   17.2.2. MAJCOM/A3 approved SCA procedures developed for other (Mission Design
   Series) MDS aircraft and specifically identified as applicable to EC-130J operations.
   17.2.3. SCA procedures developed within the flying unit and planned using parameters and
   restrictions published in approved DOD or FLIP terminal non-precision instrument approach
   procedures (i.e., Line Of Communication (LOC), Terminal Change Notice (TCN), VOR,
   NDB, Area Navigation (RNAV)/GPS).
   17.2.4. IPRA Only.
   17.2.4.1. The controlling solution must be INAV 2 and have FOM 4 or better. Position
   alert 1 and Position alert 2 must be set to 0.03 and 0.05 respectively.
   17.2.4.2. Both Pilots must verify the RPI or LZ coordinates.
   17.2.4.3. No INAV position miscompare/differences ACAWS.
   17.2.4.4.   IPRA limited to 5.4 modified aircraft.
17.3. Weather Minimums:
   17.3.1. For NIMA-published SCA and ARA procedures use published weather minimums or
   300 feet and 1 statue mile, whichever is greater.
   17.3.2. All other SCAs must be conducted in VMC unless HQ MAJCOM/A3 approves IMC
   operations. If approved for IMC operations, weather minimums will be 300‘ and 1 sm or as
   published for the approach, whichever is greater.
   17.3.3. More restrictive minimums may apply when a SCA is flown using NVGs, as
   outlined in Chapter 16.
17.4. SCA Horizontal Profile.
   17.4.1. Only straight-in SCAs with a final approach course within 20 degrees from the
   runway heading are authorized in IMC conditions. There is no offset restriction for SCA
   approaches flown in VMC conditions or when the weather is sufficient to use circling
   approach minimum criteria for maneuvering. Arcing SCAs are not authorized.
AFI11-2EC-130JV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                             125


   17.4.2. The final approach course will be a minimum of 3 nm in length. Extend the final
   course to a minimum of 3 nm for any approach procedure with less than 3 nm from the Final
   Approach Fix to the runway threshold.
   17.4.3. The SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template should be equal to the Final
   Approach Fix (FAF) distance plus 1 nm, but never less than 4 nm.
   17.4.4. Dogleg offset course will be within 90 degrees of the final approach course.
17.5. SCA Altitude Profile.
   17.5.1. When building an SCA from an existing Non-precision approach procedure, the
   glideslope must adhere to all course and altitude constraints from the original published
   procedure. These altitude constraints will be a primary factor in determining the SCA
   glideslope and altitude profile.
   17.5.2. When required for obstacle or terrain clearance, dogleg entry step-down altitudes
   will provide for a minimum of 500 feet clearance above any obstacle or terrain feature within
   3 nm of the planned course to final approach.
17.6. SCA Obstacle Clearance. Use the most current sources for topological, Chart Updating
Manual, point obstruction, and airfield information. Ensure 500 ft obstacle clearance either side
of centerline for the approach and missed approach.
17.7. SCA Missed Approach.
   17.7.1. For NIMA-published SCA and ARA procedures follow the published missed
   approach.
   17.7.2. For MAJCOM approved SCA procedures developed specifically for other MDS
   aircraft and identified as applicable to EC-130J operations follow the published missed
   approach.
   17.7.3. For SCAs planned around the parameters and restrictions published in approved
   DOD or FLIP terminal non-precision instrument approach procedures, use the published
   missed approach procedure.
   17.7.4. The MAP is at zero distance to go with reference to the runway threshold at MDA
   unless otherwise specified on the approach procedure.
17.8. SCA Route Study and Mission Briefing.
   17.8.1. During route study, crews will use all sources available to identify terrain and
   hazards within 10 nm of planned arrival airfield. Use a current chummed chart for this
   portion of route study.
   17.8.2. Determine an Airfield MSA. This altitude will be 500‘ above the highest
   obstacle/terrain feature or one contour interval above the highest depicted basic terrain
   contour plus 400 feet (whichever is higher) within 5 nm radius of the center of the runway.
17.9. General In-Flight SCA procedures.
   17.9.1. The FSO will brief the SCA, using a unit stan/eval approved SCA briefing guide,
   during the enroute cruise or the crew-briefing step of the DESCENT checklist. Additional
   briefing items may be added, as required, for the particular mission.

   17.9.2. The FSO will use all aircraft avionics systems, other than TACAN, VOR, ILS, and
   NDB, to monitor the position of and direct the aircraft.
   17.9.3. Pilots will use all available aircraft systems to monitor the progress of the approach.
   17.9.4. Use ground based radar monitoring where available (IFR and VFR).
   17.9.5. Specific In-flight SCA Procedures. The exact order in which specific items are
   accomplished will be dependent on the approach flown.
      17.9.5.1. The FSO will advise the pilot when positive radar identification of the airfield
      complex is made.
      17.9.5.2. Approaching final course the FSO will announce ―Cleared to Chase‖, at which
      time the pilots will follow INAV course guidance; or the FSO will direct the aircraft by
      headings to maintain the final approach course.
      17.9.5.3. Approximately 3 – 5 nm prior to the planned glideslope intercept point, the
      FSO will initiate the slowdown by stating ―Prepare to Slowdown……Slowdown Now.‖
      17.9.5.4. A ―10 Seconds to Descent‖ warning will be given by the FSO 10 seconds prior
      to intercepting the glide path.
      17.9.5.5. At the planned descent point the FSO will state ―Begin Descent, Glide Slope
      angle, Rate of Descent ‖ to intercept the glideslope.
      17.9.5.6. The FSO will state the distance from touchdown each mile beginning at the
      FAF.
      17.9.5.7. Using radar as the primary navigation reference, the FSO will verify course
      data and provide distance to go and altitude information at least every nautical mile
      during the final approach.
      17.9.5.8. When required, follow Chapter 16 procedures for additional NVG approach
      calls.

safe altitude, which ensures terrain clearance. A single ESA will be established for the entire
route when there are no significant changes in topography. For routes where the terrain does
vary significantly, a separate ESA may be established for route segments with similar terrain or
obstacle elevations.
WARNING:—Operation under VFR clearance in IMC conditions is an emergency procedure
during training/exercise operations, requiring appropriate IFF and radio calls to the area air
traffic control agency.      During contingency/combat missions, the necessity of flying
"communications-out" in IMC must be weighed against terrain clearance capability and
increased mid-air potential.
