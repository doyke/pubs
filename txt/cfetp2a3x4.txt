2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors will use both parts to plan, manage, and control
training.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training decisions, CCAF, and career field path. Section C associates each skill level
with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other). Section D indicates resource
constraints to accomplishing this plan, such as funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E
identifies transition training plans for the career field.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A provides an explanation of AETC course objectives and
trained proficiency levels. Section B identifies available support materials, such as Qualification Training
Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training. Section C identifies a training
course index that supervisors can use to determine if resources are available to support training. Included
here are both mandatory and optional courses. Section D identifies MAJCOM unique training
requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification
needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training
commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. Section E identifies the Specialty Training Standard
(STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course/core task, and Career Development Course (CDC)

SECTION A - GENERAL INFORMATION
1. Purpose: This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Manager
(AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and
trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. This plan
outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2A3X4 should receive to develop and progress throughout
their career. This CFETP identifies initial skill, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency
training. Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air
Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. This training is conducted by
AETC at Sheppard AFB TX. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification
requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill
levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman
in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during, and after, the upgrade training
process. It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job. Advanced
training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training,
either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel
to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several
purposes, including:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.
Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual‟s career.

1.2. Identifies tasks and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individuals career.

1.3. Lists the training courses available in the specialty and identifies sources of training and the training
delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field
training process.
2. Use of the CFETP: This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, Training Detachment
(TD), and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II
of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining the
resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and
proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy these
identified requirements. MAJCOM developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for
inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate other available training resources.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of
courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

2. Skill and Career Progression:
It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an
effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual
receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.

2.2. Apprentice (3-level): Upon completion of initial skills training, a trainee will work with a trainer to
enhance their knowledge and skills. They will utilize the Career Development Courses, Qualification
Training, and available exportable courses for continued advancement. Once task certified, a trainee may
perform the task unsupervised. Apprentices can be considered for appointment as unit trainers.

2.3. Journeyman (5-level): Individuals must complete formal 5-level OJT training. This training
involves completion of the 2A354X CDCs, as well as completion of all identified core task qualification
training and any other required duty position training. Journeymen may be assigned job positions such as
quality assurance and various staff positions. Journeymen will be considered for appointment as unit
trainers after completion of the Air Force Training Course. Individuals will use their CDCs to prepare for
promotion testing. They should also consider continuing their education toward a Community College of
the Air Force (CCAF) degree.

2.4. Craftsman (7-level): Individuals must complete formal 7-level OJT training. This training involves
completion of the 2A374 CDCs, as well as completion of all identified core task qualification training and
any other required duty position training. A 7-level can expect to fill various supervisory and
management positions such as shift leader, element chief, flight/section chief, and task certifier. They can
also be assigned to work in staff positions. Craftsmen should take courses to obtain added knowledge on
management of resources and personnel. Continued academic education through CCAF and higher
degree programs is encouraged. The AFSC shred is removed at the 7-skill level, at which point airframe
qualifications are identified by Special Equipment Identifier (SEI) codes. Shred identifiers and SEI codes
are provided in the ECD

2.5. Superintendent (9-level/CEM): A 9-level can be expected to fill positions such as flight NCOIC,
production supervisor, and various staff NCOIC jobs. Additional training in the areas of budget,
manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.
Individuals promoted to MSgt will complete the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy prior to
assuming the rank of SMSgt. Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career
AFSC are also highly encouraged.

3. Training Decisions:

3.1. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of
training requirements for the Fighter Aircraft Integrated Avionics career field. The spectrum includes a
strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements. The strategy must ensure we
develop affordable training, eliminate duplication, and prevent a fragmented approach to training.
Training decisions were made by the AFCFM, and MAJCOM Functional Managers at the career field
Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) held at Sheppard AFB TX, 18-22 Oct 2010. Additionally,
following the U&TW, the decision was made to replace the 2A3X1 AFSC with the 2A3X4, retaining the
A-10, U-2, and F-15 aircraft and adding the F-16 aircraft to the new career field. Further adjustment were

                                                                            CFETP 2A3X4, 31 January 2012


made at the F-16 U&TW in May 2012. The avionic systems maintenance for the CV-22 has been moved
to the 2A2X1 and 2A2X3 career field subsequent restructure of the 2A5X3 AFSCs.

3.2. Initial Skills: The AFSC re-structure re-aligned the current 3-skill level awarding course by shred-
specific criteria. The A-10/U-2 training will be a separate course from the F-15 course. Shred-specific
changes will necessitate course length changes. The course for the A-shred will be 84 academic days long
and will support the A-10/U-2 training requirements. The, B-shred course will be 91 academic days long
and will support the F-15 training requirements, and C-shop will be 94 academic days long and will
support the F-16 training requirements. Course lengths are approximate pending validation. The revised
F-16 course is expected to be on line March 2013. The A-10 and F-15 courses will incorporate minor
changes into the validation process scheduled for completion in Sep 2012.

3.2.1. The changes in training requirements for the A (A-10) and B (F-15) shreds were primarily a
realignment to aircraft specific tasks. Hands-on training was added for the CAPRE and the Sniper Pods
for both aircraft.

3.2.3. The changes to the F-16 (2A334C shred) initial skills course were mostly minor in scope. Use of
aircraft maintenance forms, 781H, 781K, and AFTO Form 244 were changed from the 1b to 2b task
performance/knowledge level. The AN/ARC 210 radio and Joint Services Electronic Combat Test Set
(JSECTS) were added to the CFTEP line items and taught to the “A” subject knowledge level. The
largest changes were in the Radar Threat Warning and Counter Measures Set systems. All proficiency
levels were removed from the ALR 69 system. This training is covered using the ALR-56M and the
ALQ-213 systems.

3.3. Five-Level Upgrade Training: The 5-level CDCs will be five volumes total. The general portion
of the CDC will consist of two volumes and the aircraft systems portion will consist of 3 volumes.
Upgrade requirements also include completion of core tasks. The AFSC will be shred-less at the 7-level.

3.4. Seven-Level Upgrade Training: Total core tasks for A-10 were revised to 22 for the 7-level. F-15
core tasks were changed to a total of 16 for the 7-level. Completion of the new 2A374 CDC was
incorporated as a 7-level upgrade requirement. The requirement to complete the 2AX7X CDC was
removed. Airmen in upgrade training for 2A374 7-level will be task qualified on all core tasks and
identified work center requirements for their assigned weapons system.

3.5. Continuation Training: The purpose of the continuation training program is to provide additional
training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty
positions. To define and standardize this training, MAJCOMs develop continuation training programs that
ensure individuals in the avionic career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their
career. The training program should identify both mandatory and optional training requirements. After
upgrade to five-level, airmen must complete the FTD Advanced Wiring Class (MMCL Mandate).

                                                                          CFETP 2A3X4, 31 January 2012


PART II

SECTION A—SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

1. Implementation: The STS will be used for technical training provided by Air Education and Training
Command for classes beginning January 2012. The STS is organized in attachments to this document for
“General” training requirements, applicable to all MDS, and individual attachments for each MDS, Pods
and Avionic Principles.

2. Purpose: As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge,
and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. All
task/knowledge taught in the initial skills courses will be taught in the wartime initial skills courses.

2.2. Identifies in column 2 (Core Tasks), by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements. MAJCOM
Functional Managers, commanders, and supervisors may designate additional core tasks as necessary.
When designated, certify these core tasks using normal core task certification procedures. Certification on
all shop/flightline core tasks applicable to at least one Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft assigned
must be completed for skill level upgrade. When a base has multiple MDSs or blocks assigned, trainees
are only required to complete core task training on MDSs or blocks assigned to their unit of
assignment.

2.3. Column 3 provides certification for OJT. It is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician
qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification/completed date.

2.4. Column 4 (Proficiency Codes) show formal training and correspondence course requirements and
shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as result of training on the
task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. When two codes are
used in columns 4A and 4B (e.g. 2b/b), the first code is the established requirement for resident training
on the task/knowledge, and the second code indicates the level of training provided in the course due to
equipment shortages or other resource constraints. See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the
unit-training manager for current CDC listing.


3. Qualitative Requirements: Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level
of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

4. Job Qualification Standard: The STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job
training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.
For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go" means the individual
can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct
procedures. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:




                                                     17
                                                                           CFETP 2A3X4, 31 January 2012


4.1 Documentation. Document and certify completion of training utilizing Training Business Area
(TBA), IAW AFI 36-2201. Automated records and utilizing MIS reflecting this STS is highly
encouraged.

4.1.1. Transcribing from Old CFETP to New CFETP. All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are
replaced by this CFETP; therefore, transcribing of all training records to this CFETP STS is mandatory.
Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.
Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201.

5. Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT). The STS serves as a guide for development of promotion tests
used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). SKTs are developed at the USAF
Occupational Measurement Squadron, by Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career
fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team
members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references
listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program.
WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve.

6. Recommendations: Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to the AETC
training manager at 365 TRS/TRR, 609 9th Ave, Sheppard AFB TX, 76311-2338, DSN 736-7901 or e-
mail james.eubanks@sheppard.af.mil. Reference specific STS paragraphs. For a quick response to
problems, call our customer service information line, DSN 736-2574.


SECTION B – 3-LEVEL COURSE TRAINING

1. Introduction. Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is
measured through the use of an objective. An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she
knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task. Each objective is
comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard that states what is expected of the student for each task.
The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc). The
behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check). The standard is the
level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained (i.e. “with no
more than two instructor assists”). AETC course objectives and associated information are published in
the Plan of Instruction (POI) for each of the courses identified in Section C, below, Training Course
Index.

2. Objective Measurement. Each objective uses letter codes(s) to identify how it is measured. All
objectives using the PC code indicate a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge. W
indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject or task knowledge at the end of
a block of instruction. PC/W indicates a subject or task knowledge progress check and a separate
measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test.

3. Objective Standard. The standard for written examinations is 70%. Standards for performance
objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check checklist.
The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student‟s progress, on each task. Instructor
assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or



                                                     18
                                                                           CFETP 2A3X4, 31 January 2012


part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. Students must satisfactorily complete all
PCs prior to taking the written test.

4. Proficiency Level. Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular
task or knowledge item. Review the course objective list to determine which STS item the objective
supports. Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section A of this CFETP for an explanation of the
proficiency codes. Most task performance is taught to the „2b‟ proficiency level which means the
students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially
proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. For tasks that are
taught to the „3c‟ proficiency level, students can do all parts of the task and only require a spot check on
completed work (competent). The student can also identify why and when a task must be done and why
each step is needed.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a
subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.

Attachment 2 – General Training Requirements
This general training requirements section indicates formal training proficiency levels, OJT training, and core tasks applicable to all the
2A3X4 shreds. The general training requirements section of the CFETP is used to code core competencies of the career field that will be
taught in the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments are to be used in conjunction with the general section to identify work center
requirements and annotate qualifications
  NOTE 1: All 3-level resident course requirements are trained during wartime.
  NOTE 2: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
  NOTE 3: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
  NOTE 4: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B of the General Attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does not
             apply to a procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task in the General Attachment is
             waived.

Attachment 3 – A-10 Training Requirements
This section indicates formal training proficiency levels, OJT training, and core tasks applicable to all the 2A3X4A shred. The general
training requirements section of the CFETP is used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in the apprentice course.
The MDS specific attachments are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to identify work center requirements and
annotate qualification.
  NOTE 1: All 3-level resident course requirements are trained during wartime.
  NOTE 2: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
  NOTE 3: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
  NOTE 4: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B this attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does not apply to a
             procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task is waived.
  NOTE 5: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 4 – F-15 Training Requirements
This section indicates formal training proficiency levels, OJT training, and core tasks applicable to all the 2A3X4B shred.
 NOTE 1: All 3-level resident course requirements are trained during wartime. The general training requirements section of the CFETP is
             used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments
             are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to identify work center requirements and annotate
             qualification.
 NOTE 2: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 3: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 4: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B this attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does not apply to a
             procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task is waived.
 NOTE 5: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 5 – F-16 Training Requirements
This section indicates formal training proficiency levels, OJT training, and core tasks applicable to all the 2A3X4B shred.
 NOTE 1: All 3-level resident course requirements are trained during wartime. The general training requirements section of the CFETP is
             used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments
             are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to identify work center requirements and annotate
             qualification.
 NOTE 2: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 3: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 4: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B this attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does not apply to a
             procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task is waived.
 NOTE 5: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 6 – U-2 Training Requirements
This section indicates formal training proficiency levels, OJT training, and core tasks applicable to avionic technicians assigned to perform
U-2 maintenance.
 NOTE 1: All 3-level resident course requirements are trained during wartime. The general training requirements section of the CFETP is
             used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments
             are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to identify work center requirements and annotate
             qualification.
 NOTE 2: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 3: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 4: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B this attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does not apply to a
             procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task is waived.
 NOTE 5: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 7 – Pod Training Requirements
This section indicates formal training proficiency levels, OJT training, and core tasks applicable to avionic technicians assigned to perform
Pod maintenance.
 NOTE 1: All 3-level resident course requirements are trained during wartime. The general training requirements section of the CFETP is
             used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments
             are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to identify work center requirements and annotate
             qualification.
 NOTE 2: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 3: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 4: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B this attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does not apply to a
             procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task is waived.
 NOTE 5: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN
