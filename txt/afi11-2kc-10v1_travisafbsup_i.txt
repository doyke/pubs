                                             Chapter 1

                                             GENERAL

1.1. Training Objective. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training
United States Air Force KC-10 crewmembers according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew
Training.
1.1. (TRAVIS)This instruction serves as a guide for 60th Operations Group (60 OG) and
349th Operations Group (349 OG) aircrew training processes. All others should use this
supplement for information-only purposes and shall refer to their appropriate supplement for
guidance. The goals of this volume are twofold. First, standardize and consolidate various
procedures and practices for accomplishing training across the 60 and 349 OGs. Second, clarify
or add guidance not addressed in the parent AFI so squadron-level training officers and
supervisors can better manage their training programs.
     1.1.1. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop and maintain a
     high state of mission readiness for immediate and effective employment in exercises,
     peacekeeping operations, contingencies, and war.            Mission readiness and effective
     employment are achieved through the development and mastery of core competencies for
     KC-10 crewmembers. These core competencies include the ability to conduct receiver and
     tanker AAR, tactical ingress, tactical egress, and tanker operations during all phases of flight,
     instrument procedures, mission planning, ground operations, crew management and C4/AOC
     integration.
     1.1.2. Link AFTTP 3-3.KC-10, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—KC-10, requirements into
     mission and continuation training tables while retaining a combat culture, leading edge
     technologies, pushing capabilities while anticipating warfighter needs.
     1.1.3. The secondary objective is to standardize KC-10 training requirements into a single
     document to meet requirements for a basic document in AFI 11-200, Aircrew Training,
     Standardization/Evaluation, and General Operations Structure.
     1.1.4. Throughout this document references are made to training requirements controlled by
     other AFIs and provide guidance derived from those AFIs. The controlling AFI may be
     updated after the publication of this document, so it is necessary to refer to the source
     document AFI for current guidance. If a conflict is identified for a training requirement,
     comply with source document that establishes the training requirement.
1.2. Key Words Explained.
     1.2.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.2.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
     to emphasize.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                  9

   Engineer Flight Boom Operator Flight or through the OST organizational mailbox at
   60OSSOST@us.af.mil. Approved changes will be incorporated into each change or new
   publication release.
   1.3.2. Supplements. This AFI is a basic directive. Each MAJCOM or operational theater
   may supplement this AFI. MAJCOM supplements may be more, but not less restrictive than
   this instruction.
       1.3.2.1. MAJCOMs may set training requirements lower than specified in this instruction
       when the statement ―or as specified in MAJCOM supplement‖ is indicated as applicable
       to that item or event. MAJCOM supplements must be coordinated/approved by
       AMC/A3T and AF/A3O-AT IAW AFPD 11-2, and AFI 11-202 Volume 1, before
       publication. Units will send one copy of local supplement to the parent MAJCOM OPR.
   1.3.3. Local Training Guidance. Units may supplement this instruction and will submit a
   copy of the supplement to the parent MAJCOM OPR after approval by the OG/CC. Air
   National Guard (ANG) is considered a MAJCOM for purposes of this instruction per AFI 11-
   202 Vol 1.
   1.3.3. (TRAVIS) This instruction will be maintained by Aircrew Training (60 OSS/OST).
   Electronic copies can be downloaded from the 60 OG/OGV SharePoint at
   https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/60og/ogv/default.aspx and the AF e-Publishing website at
   http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.
   1.3.4. If a conflict is identified for a training requirement, comply with source document that
   establishes the training requirement.
1.4. Responsibilities. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 outlines responsibilities for aircrew training. See
Chapter 6 for specific responsibilities related to the KC-10 Aircrew Training System (ATS).
   1.4.1. Lead Command. Air Mobility Command (AMC) is designated lead command for the
   KC-10 Mission Design Series (MDS) as specified in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command
   Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, AFPD 11-2, and AFPD 10-21, Air
   Mobility Lead Command Roles and Responsibilities. Lead command is responsible for
   establishing and standardizing aircrew flying training requirements in coordination with user
   commands. AMC/A3 delegates to AMC/A3T the authority to manage all training course
   requirements, training tasks and Aircrew Training Systems (ATS).              AMC/A3T in
   coordination with user commands approves/fields continuation training requirements or
   adjustments, and short-notice specialized local upgrade courses (e.g., FM Immunity).
   AMC/A3T is OPR for this AFI.

     1.4.1.1. Courses. AMC/A3T, in coordination with user commands, approves initial,
     mission certification and continuation training requirements and fields locally taught
     upgrade courses.
     1.4.1.2. Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB). AMC/A3T will host a RTRB
     biennially, or more frequently as required. The RTRB reviews all training programs for
     currency, applicability, compliance and effectiveness. Attendees should include training
     representatives from AMC/A3T/A3V/A3D, USAF Expeditionary Center (USAF
     EC)/WCOX, AFRC, curriculum developers, formal schools, selected unit representatives,
     and aircrew training system (ATS) contractors, as applicable.
     1.4.1.3. Detachment 1, Air Mobility Command Air Operations Squadron (AMCAOS):
        1.4.1.3.1. Aircrew Training Device (ATD) Certification. Det 1 AMCAOS personnel
        will conduct a semi-annual Simulator Certification (SIMCERT) on all ATDs
        according to AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems, FAA AC
        120-40B, Airplane Simulator Qualification, FAA AC 120-45A, Airplane Flight
        Training Device Qualification and, Aerial Refueling Airplane Simulator Qualification
        (ARASQ). SIMCERT includes objective and subjective testing, inventory inspection,
        Quality Assurance Inspection (QAI), and contract compliance evaluation. The
        contractor will run one quarter (1/4) of the Qualification Test Guide (QTG) every
        three months based on actual aircraft data. These tests will annotate Pass or Fail for
        each sub-test prior to semi-annual simulator certification. Det 1 AMCAOS will use
        one simulator period to randomly sample 10% of the QTG. This profile will be stated
        in the notification letter to the contractor.
            1.4.1.3.1.1. Flight Training Device (FTD)Certification. The FTD is tested and
            certified in the same manner as the simulator except where the fidelity of the
            device limits the tests. The standards for these types of devices are derived from
            FAA AC 120-45A.
            1.4.1.3.1.2. SIMCERT. Notify the host unit 45 days in advance of a scheduled
            SIMCERT. A short-notice SIMCERT is available with verbal coordination
            between host unit, Det 1, AMCAOS, AMC/A3TK, ATS contractor, and the ATS
            contract management team. Report SIMCERT results to AMC/A3TK and AFMC
            ASC/WNSPA.
            1.4.1.3.1.3. Monitor training device utilization, availability, and ensure
            equipment malfunctions are corrected through coordination with the ATS
            contractor, when required.
            1.4.1.3.1.4. Det 1 AMCAOS Simulator Testing and Familiarity Training. Det 1
            will coordinate directly with the contractor when testing or familiarity training in
            the simulator is required. The use of the simulator will be on a non-interference
            basis with contractor concurrence and Det 1 AMCAOS/CC approval.
        1.4.1.3.2. ATS Courseware Certification.     KC-10 courseware development,
        revisions, and acceptance are tracked by mutually accepted process between the
        government and the ATS contractor. This process is to review and approve KC-10
        courseware for timely delivery, accuracy, and compliance with the KC-10
        Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Management Plan and USAF courseware
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                              11


         standards. The chief of courseware or appropriate Det 1 courseware representative
         will issue final approval for the government after the training media is ready for
         implementation at the training sites. Contractual acceptance for the government is
         vested in the KC-10 program‘s contracting office located at Wright-Patterson AFB
         (ASC/WNSPA).
            1.4.1.3.2.1. Training Systems Configuration Working Group (TSCWG) will be
            held monthly or as specified by the ATS contract, and attended by Det 1 Simcert
            and Courseware representatives. The status and disposition of each courseware
            effort, whether in-scope, out-of-scope, late, or delayed will be briefed by the ATS
            contractor courseware staff. Det 1 AMCAOS will alert ASC/WNSPA and
            AMC/A3TK of any discrepancies that cannot be resolved through Det 1 and
            contractor agreements.
            1.4.1.3.2.2. Det 1 AMCAOS will schedule Subject Matter Experts (SME) for
            Technical Interchange Meetings (TIM) with the ATS contractor. Det 1
            AMCAOS will also schedule crewmembers (as required by the contractor) to
            assist in courseware development including Individual Tryouts (ITO) and Small
            Group Tryouts (SGTO).
         1.4.1.3.3. Contract Compliance. Det 1 AMCAOS personnel will conduct periodic
         Contract Compliance Evaluations (CCE) for KC-10 ATS-supported sites and report
         results to AMC/A3TK and ATS contract management. Evaluation personnel assess
         ATS contractor performance of aircrew ground training programs to include
         Computer-Based Training (CBT), simulator training, and facilities. The KC-10 ATS
         site and Air Force-Appointed ATS Project Officer (PO) and Quality Assurance
         Representative (QAR) (PO/QAR) will receive 45-day advance notice of the CCE
         (non-interference basis) via notification memo or email. Unit support may include
         the use of an inbrief/outbrief facility, approximately 4-hours CBT time, and access to
         available crewmembers and staff for the purpose of conducting surveys and/or
         soliciting comments. Units should consider the CCE a unit-level feedback tool to
         monitor quality of ATS ground training.
  1.4.2. Training Command. AMC/A3 is responsible for formal school syllabi and is the
  approval authority for any changes in coordination with lead and user commands according
  to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. AMC/A3 designates AMC/A3T to oversee formal school courses
  and syllabi management in coordination with the ATS contractor through AMC/A3TK.
  AMC/A3TF manages the Programmed Flying Training (PFT) process (see paragraph 1.14)
  and determines formal school flying capacity.
     1.4.2.1. Progress Review (PR). See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and associated KC-10 course
     syllabus.   AMC/A3TK will notify Det 1 AMCAOS for ATS follow-on action, if
     required.
     1.4.2.2. AETC maintains a list of formal school courses in the Education and Training
     Course Announcement (ETCA). The site address is: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
  1.4.3. User Commands.
     1.4.3.1. Student Management. MAJCOM training staff will manage their student
     training requirements according to paragraph 1.14.2.2.

     1.4.3.2. Recall Procedures. Requests to recall students from a formal school course must
     be sent from the student‘s unit to AMC/A3T and AFRC/A3T, as applicable. AMC/A3T
     will accomplish all necessary coordination with appropriate agencies. Emergency recall
     during non-duty hours may be coordinated directly with the schoolhouse with notification
     to AMC/A3T on the next duty day.
     1.4.3.3. Training resources. User commands will evaluate training resources (aircraft
     and aircrews) required to accomplish training requirements and identify known shortfalls
     to A3 for resolution. Evaluations will be ongoing and revalidated every semi-annual
     period.
  1.4.4. Wing Commander. WG/CC will ensure unit/local level agencies and facilities support
  aircrew ground training programs. Host and/or co-located units will develop local
  agreements to consolidate aircrew training support base wide.
  1.4.5. Operations Groups.
     1.4.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) will convene a training review panel (TRP) to be
     chaired by the OG/CC or a designated representative. Panel members should include
     representatives from squadron training, formal training unit (FTU), tactics, operations,
     safety and other areas as determined by the commander (i.e. ATS contractors, Host
     Aviation Resource Management (HARM) and Squadron Resource Management
     (SARM)).
     1.4.5.1. (TRAVIS) Sq/CCs, DOs, and DOT representatives should attend along with
     FTU and ATS contractor representatives.
         1.4.5.1.1. TRP Requirements. Convene the TRP semi-annually and maintain
         minutes for a period of two years (commanders may increase this frequency as
         required). Squadrons and detachments not collocated with their OG may conduct
         their own panel or provide representation to the unit's TRP. Panel minutes from non-
         collocated squadron and detachment TRPs will be forwarded to the unit for inclusion
         in the unit's TRP.
         1.4.5.1.1. (TRAVIS) 60 OSS/OSTT orchestrates the 60 OG TRP briefing.
         Attendees include Sq CCs, DOs, DOT personnel, and ATS contractor representatives,
         depending on availability. 60 OSS/OSTT documents TRP findings. The 60 OG/CC
         signs the meeting minutes, which 60 OSS/OSTT maintains in a common location that
         may be accessed by the respective flying squadrons and ATS contractors (i.e., 60
         OSS/OST SharePoint Website). The 349 OG/CC or designated representative
         convenes, chairs, and documents a 349th TRP separately.
         1.4.5.1.2. TRP Format. The TRP should review staff and crewmember management
         actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs.
         Suggested TRP topics include, but are not limited to current and forecast Flying
         Training Levels, (FTL), Upgrade and Continuation Training status, Semi-Annual and
         Annual requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft

1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 4515.13-R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202 Volume 1,
   Aircrew Training.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or
       off-station training missions.
       1.6.1.2. See AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for off-station training flight
       requirements.
       1.6.1.2. (TRAVIS) Detailed instructions on off-station training flight requirements for
       Travis AFB can be found in the 60 and 349 Air Mobility Wing‗s Wing Operations Plan
       (WOP) located on the 60 OSS/OSO SharePoint website (See Attachment 1-Travis of
       this supplement).
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC may approve upgrade, qualification or special qualification/certification training on
   operational missions. See passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2KC-10
   Volume 3, KC-10 Operations Procedures.
       1.6.2.1. Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and
       the crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like
       specialty. In the event the mission changes and the training status may affect the ability
       of the crew to fly the mission, the instructor will ensure coordination between OG/CC
       and 618th AOC (TACC) prior to accepting the mission.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2 for
mission certification training (MCT), and in-unit training. Note: for Phase IA and IB time
limitations of formal KC-10 qualification, upgrade, and requalification courses refer to Table
A3.3. Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to upgrade qualification (or
requalification) will be dedicated to that program on a full-time basis. EXCEPTION:
Supervisory personnel may continue their normal duties as time permits. In-unit training will
begin no later than 45 days (90 days AFRC) after reporting or being attached to a new duty
station or unit.

Table 1.2. In-Unit Training Time Limitations (MCT).

 Includes in-unit training leading to MR status
 following initial, difference, or requalification
 training.
   1.7.1. Training Time. Training time start date is the date when the first significant training
   event (a training event directly contributing to qualification or upgrade, e.g. computer-based
   training (CBT) lesson, part task trainer (PTT), weapon system trainer (WST), flight training
   device (FTD), boom operator trainer (BOT), aircrew system trainer (AST) ground training,
   flight training) or 45 days (90 days AFRC) after being attached or assigned to the unit after
   completion of the formal school, whichever occurs first. Voluntary self-study prior to course
   start date does not count as training time start date. (See paragraph 2.2.2) Training time ends
   with the successful completion of one of the following events: flight evaluation (if required
   as part of the training program), instructor validation of successful program completion
   (―sign-off‖), or squadron commander certification (if required as part of the training
   program).
   1.7.2. For in-unit (not FTU) Phase I and MCT training, Sq/CC may extend training time up
   to 60 days (120 days ARC). No notification to MAJCOM/A3T is required. Extensions
   exceeding 60 days (120 days for AFRC) require MAJCOM/A3T approval. Units will notify
   the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) via the waiver request procedures specified in
   paragraph 1.5.9, before the crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits in Table 1.2.
   Include training difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and
   estimated completion date in the waiver request.
1.8. Training Documentation. Units will use the AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew
Qualification Worksheet as prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, to update aircrew certifications
in ARMS. See Chapter 7 for specific ―Q‖ codes. See Attachment 2 for additional training
documentation requirements.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight examiners as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. Units may use flight examiners as instructors for
qualification, upgrade, and corrective action training. If an examiner is used as a primary
instructor to train an individual, the same examiner should not administer the associated
evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements:
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below).
   1.10.2. Instructor candidates who previously attended a formal instructor school for
   instructor qualification and were qualified instructors in any US Air Force aircraft and who
   meet the minimum flying hour requirements may upgrade in-unit with OG/CC approval.
   Sq/CC will determine training required to complete the instructor upgrade in-unit, including
   evaluations IAW AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 2, KC-10 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   1.10.2. (TRAVIS) 60 AMW Only: Squadrons will notify chain of command how and
   when accomplishing in-unit Instructor qualification. Using the waiver web process or
   standard memorandum format and squadron letterhead, provide a brief description of the
   individual‗s prior qualifications, the date of last qualification and a brief description of the
   duties performed by the individual since qualification was lost. Also provide a detailed
   description of the proposed number and type of training events to be accomplished as well as
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                23


  the required proficiency level for each event (AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training
  Accomplishment Report may be used to fulfill this requirement). Waiver web should be used
  to the max extent possible in submitting these requests. However, if unable to process via
  waiver web create a memorandum for record as described in Table 1.3 (Added-TRAVIS).
  See paragraph 1.4.5.2.1 (Added-TRAVIS) of this supplement concerning the ADSC
  requirements.
  1.10.3. Formal Training Unit (FTU) Instructors. Active duty Operations Support Squadrons
  are provided with staff authorizations (pilot, flight engineer, and boom operator) over and
  above the crew force. Positions are allocated per AMC manpower standard (AMCMS) to
  support initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, and continuation training requirements
  at each KC-10 MOB. Personnel assigned to these positions must be very capable, highly
  experienced both as instructors and KC-10 aircrew members. All FTU instructors must be
  thoroughly familiar with KC-10 course books, training requirements, operational techniques,
  and the contractor training program. Assigned instructors will have an associate degree or
  higher within one year of being assigned to FTU instructor duty.
     1.10.3.1. Faculty Training Course (FTC). The Faculty Training Course is taught at the
     FTU to prepare newly assigned instructors for schoolhouse duties. This course will be
     locally developed and updated as necessary. All instructors conducting initial
     qualification flying training should be graduates of FTC.
  1.10.4. Instructor Supervision Requirements. When performing aircrew duties, the following
  personnel must be under the supervision of an instructor:
     1.10.4.1. All non-current crewmembers. For non-current crewmembers, direct instructor
     supervision is required while performing the non-current event. (See paragraph 4.9 for
     exceptions).
     1.10.4.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training.
     1.10.4.3. Any other personnel designated by the Wing/CC, OG/CC, or Sq/CC.
     1.10.4.4. All unqualified or flying training level (FTL) ―E‖ crewmembers require direct
     instructor supervision during critical phases of flight.
     1.10.4.5. Exceptions to paragraph 1.10.4 Instructor Supervision Requirements:
         1.10.4.5.1. Instructor supervision is not required for pilots certified by the Sq/CC to
         conduct receiver AAR under the supervision of a Sq/CC certified Aircraft
         Commander.
         1.10.4.5.2. Students in upgrade training may fly, on a limited basis, without
         instructor supervision as a crewmember in their previous position provided they are
         current and qualified in that position (i.e. an MF in upgrade to IF may fly
         unsupervised as an MF).
         1.10.4.5.3. During FTU training, two Instructor Aircraft Commander (IAC) students
         (or one PCO student and one IAC student) may sit in the seat together for all events
         in which they are current and qualified.
         1.10.4.5.4. For IAC training, selected aircraft events (F020-Formation, F060-AAR
         Formation, and R080-Tanker AAR, Autopilot-Off) do not require the IAC student to
 24                           AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


          be at a set of controls; the IAC student must demonstrate the ability to instruct to a
          proficient level while the event is being accomplished.
          1.10.4.5.4. (TRAVIS) KC-10 IAC students must be at a set of controls to
          demonstrate the ability to instruct their way through P005-Taxi Exercise.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish the necessary hard copy distribution requirements of
this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews.
   1.12.1. When a crewmember transfers from one unit to another, the gaining unit will review,
   assess and assign the appropriate FTL. During the review, the gaining unit will normally
   honor the losing unit‘s assigned training level. Certified/qualified MR crewmembers
   transferring between units accomplish only unit-specific training and any applicable events in
   which they have lost currency. See paragraphs 3.3.5 and 3.4.2 for additional information in
   regards to transfer of aircrew members.
   1.12.2. For Foreign Military Sales, guest pilot, and/or exchange officers see training
   requirements in AFI 11-401. Initial and/or continuation training requirements are specified
   in the appropriate MOU, OPLAN or agreement and should mirror requirements of this AFI
   to the maximum extent possible.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is duty not including flying
(DNIF) may log ground training events (including simulator) if the member's physical condition
allows it. If the crewmember‘s ability to complete training is in question, consult the flight
surgeon signing the AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special
Operational Duty, placing the crewmember in a DNIF status IAW AFI 48-123, Volume 3,
Medical Examinations and Standards, Flying and Special Operational Duty if the DNIF status
includes ground training limitations.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Program Requirements Document (PRD). According to AFI 11-412, Aircrew
   Management, USAF/A3O-AT projects KC-10 long-range training requirements annually in
   a process called the PRD. Lead and user commands contribute to the PRD, which becomes a
   key long-range planning tool for training requirements.
   1.14.2. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AMC/A3TF is designated to manage the KC-
   10 PFT process in coordination with user commands. The PFT balances available training
   quotas, ATS throughput, schoolhouse capacity and course requirements on a fiscal year
   basis. Annually, units will send projected PFT requirements (RCS: HAF-XOO(AR) 9722) to
   their respective MAJCOM training staff, who in turn, will forward projected requirements to
   the PFT manager at AMC/A3TF.
       1.14.2.1. An annual PFT conference is held to consider training capacity, MAJCOM training
       requests, and pipeline student inputs. Upon validation, AMC/A3TF approves the PFT,
       allocating quotas to each command, who in turn allocate training quotas to each unit.
       1.14.2.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AFPC PFT managers
       use assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into the KC-10
       formal school classes. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made on quota
       management documents. AMC/A3TF will publish the annual PFT quota workbook at:
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                 25


       https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-OP-AM-99-
       15-5-2&Filter=OO-OP-AM-99
1.15. Information Management. AMC/A3T hosts aircrew training information on a military
website. Training event descriptions are maintained on the website, as well as non-ATS training
courses (e.g., GRACC, FM Immunity, ATD status, host nation agreements (HNA), etc). Site is:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AM-94.
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If the training received leads to a
qualification or certification that must be met for the unit‘s mission, comply with syllabus
guidelines. If a crewmember fails to complete a formal course, the formal school will send a
recommendation to the individual‘s gaining unit. The recommendation will state whether he or
she should complete training in-unit, return to the formal school to complete training, or be
referred to the AF personnel system for reassignment.
   1.16.1. Progress Review Board (PRB). If a student fails to progress in accordance with the
   requirements in this volume, the trainee‘s gaining flying unit Sq/CC will conduct a progress
   review. A PRB will be convened to review the trainee‘s records and recommend continuing
   training, re-training, modify training, or a Flight Evaluation Board (FEB). OG/CC will have
   final approval of PRB recommendations. (See AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist
   Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, for FEB and administrative procedures. Note: In
   certain situations, AFI 11-402, Chapters 3 and 4 outline additional information regarding
   removal from training short of the FEB process for initial Career Enlisted Aviator‘s (CEA)
   training.) The ATS contractor will identify students who fail to progress IAW the applicable
   ATS guidance as outlined in Chapter 6.
       1.16.1.1. The make-up of the PRB will be at the Sq/CC‘s discretion, but will include, as
       a minimum, Sq/CC, OST and OGV representatives, and FTU Chief. Phase I ATS and
       Det 1 (or Det 1 designated attendee) will be represented as well.
   1.16.2. Supervised Status/Retraining.        Each unit will determine their process for
   documenting performance that IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2, KC-10 Aircrew Evaluation
   Criteria, has caused a crewmember to be administratively downgraded, failed an evaluation,
   failed to demonstrate proficiency once MR, or similar situation which would put a
   crewmember into a supervised status. This process will include how and where to document
   the crewmember‘s retraining. As a minimum, an AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, is
   opened for the retraining. The crewmember‘s unit should develop a training plan, coordinate
   training resource requirement through OSS/OST, then gain Sq/CC approval. For those
   individuals being trained at the FTU (initial qualification, requalification, and upgrade), FTU
   instructor(s) will coordinate the training plan and gain FTU Chief approval. The AF Form
   4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report documenting the completed training will then be
   given to the unit‘s Stan/Eval section and the crewmember will be rechecked at the Sq/CC‘s
   discretion (exercised through Stan/Eval.)
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviator Skill Levels. CEAs are not tied to AFI 36-2101, Classifying
Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), and skill level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew
qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When AF Form 8,
Certificate of Aircrew Qualification as prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that
crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of
 26                            AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct
from OJT trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in AFSC by use of "K" prefix (aircrew
instructor) and "Q" prefix (standardization and evaluation flight examiner).
1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC's policy
and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in AFI 36-
2201, Volume 1, Air Force Training Program, AFI 36-2107 Active Duty Service Commitments, and
AFI 11-412 Aircrew Management. This policy is mandatory for all AMC units.
   1.18.1. AMC Units: Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
   requirements) will be submitted to the appropriate AMC/A3TF quota manager NLT 30 Sep
   for the following fiscal year. AMC/A3TF will consolidate and crosscheck requests with the
   Pilot Absorption Management System (PAMS) and submit to Air Staff via the annual
   Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual
   Programmed Flying Training (PFT) conference.
       1.18.1.1. Other MAJCOMS:         Submit Formal Aircrew Training requirements to
       appropriate MAJCOM Functional Managers NLT 30 SEP for the following fiscal year.
       The Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
       requirements) will be internally coordinated by MAJCOM Functional managers and
       submitted to Air Staff via the annual GPRD Data Call and finalized at the annual
       Programmed Flying Training (PFT) conference.
   1.18.2. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class
   number to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to class start date (CSD). Please ensure that any
   internal processes are adjusted to meet this timeline. Training quotas not filled 30 days prior
   to CSD will be offered to the next unit on the AMC/A3TF standby list. OSS training offices
   should reconfirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to
   ensure notification of training, active duty service commitments are established, and orders
   issued. Please submit all candidates for training quotas to AMC/A3TF.
       1.18.2.1. All course prerequisites will be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to allow
       for remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an alternate candidate
       for each allocated quota. If the primary candidate becomes unavailable 30 - 45 days prior
       to CSD, notify AMC/A3TF with the alternate's information. If the primary becomes
       unavailable within 30 days of CSD, contact your host MPF formal training section to
       locally substitute the alternate IAW AMCI 36-2204, AMC Formal Training Program -
       provide a copy of the local substitution letter to AMC/A3TF.
       1.18.2.2. Foreign exchange officers cannot be locally substituted (they must also be
       identified when submitted to load against an allocation), send the replacement's full data
       to AMC/A3TF.
       1.18.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Active duty squadrons should provide all class attendee
       names to OSTT a minimum of 60 days prior to class start date. OG/CC waivers, if
       required, will be requested and approved prior to submitting class attendee names or
       requesting classes in order to prevent cancellation. Reserve class attendees are due to
       AFRC through 349 OST a minimum of 60 days prior to class start date.
   1.18.3. When submitting local upgrade (secondary method) requests, use the AMC/A3TF
   web-site: https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/userlogin.cfm.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                              27


     1.18.3.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank,
     name, upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact.
     Inform via e-mail when training is complete. If the training being conducted would
     normally incur an active duty service commitment (ADSC), insure required counseling
     and AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) Acknowledgement Statement
     is completed prior to start of training. Contact your local MPF Formal Training office for
     additional guidance. MILPDS training RIPs will automatically generate ADSC
     requirements.
     1.18.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) See Paragraph 1.4.5.2
  1.18.4. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify
  AMC/A3TF so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified
  candidate from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training,
  etc.), inform AMC/A3TF immediately. Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45
  days prior to CSD.
  1.18.5. All no-shows and late cancellations within 7 days of CSD must be explained.
  Forward an initial report of circumstances to AMC/A3TF quota management office within 24
  hours of CSD. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum of explanation
  from the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred method. Send to:
  AMC.A3T@us.af.mil
  1.18.6. Global Reach Aircraft Commanders Course (GRACC). Active duty units will be
  given priority over AFRC and ANG units due to mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC
  crews established in paragraph 5.3.4.3. Do not submit more than two candidates per wing
  per class without the GRACC scheduler's approval. Submit names NET 45 days and NLT 30
  days prior to CSD. AMC/A3TF will release the class roster 30 days prior to CSD for units to
  confirm the names and make any necessary corrections. Unfilled quotas will be available 14
  days prior to CSD and units will be notified. Cancellations must be received NLT four duty
  days prior to CSD to avoid a no-show. AMC/A3TF will not accept any additions 72 hours/3
  days prior to CSD. Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to CSD to avoid a no-show being
  charged to the unit. Questions regarding GRACC Scheduling can be referred to AMC/A3TF,
  DSN 779-7881.
  1.18.7. AMC/A3TF will maintain a standby list for each course offered. Send requests for
  additional quotas to AMC/A3TF for placement on the standby list. If unit capability is in
  jeopardy, AMC/A3TF will coordinate with Air Staff and AETC to add or reallocate
  additional quotas. AMC/A3TF quota managers will coordinate with the OSS training offices
  exclusively. Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office. This
  policy is to ensure that all offices responsible for quota management are in-synch with each
  other and prevents lost seats. Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the primary
  and alternate point of contact for quota management in the OSS.
  1.18.8. AMC units are prohibited from coordinating quota exchanges with other commands.
  OSS/OST training offices will forward all requests to the AMC quota manager for
  coordination with other commands. Please allow for extended coordination time when
  considering this option.

                          INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 defines initial qualification training. This
chapter specifies minimum training requirements for initial qualification, requalification,
conversion/difference qualification, and senior officer courses. Phase IA training is provided by
the ATS contractor and consists of academic training and various ATDs. Following successful
completion of Phase IA, Phase IB is conducted at the Formal Training Unit (FTU) where aircraft
training is received. MCT training completes all remaining mission ready and qualification /
certification training requirements. The sole method of KC-10 initial qualification is to attend
and complete the appropriate formal training course listed at the ETCA website. The website
address is: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/
2.2. Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification prerequisites
in accordance with Table 6.1, course syllabi, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   2.2.1. First Assignment Instructor Pilots (FAIPs), Operational Support Aircraft (OSA)
   Aircraft Commanders, and Major Weapon Systems (MWS) aircraft commanders meeting
   flying hour requirements in Table 6.1 complete Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification
   (ACIQ) course. Graduates of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and pilots
   not meeting the flying hour requirements will complete Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ)
   course and comply with the Mobility Pilot Development Program (MPD) described in
   paragraph 5.2.
       2.2.1.1. MC-12 volunteers will be scheduled for KC-10 PIQ by the AMC/A3TF Quota
       Management Branch after completion of the MC-12 tour.
   2.2.2. Before starting a formal initial qualification course, the student may begin training
   (e.g. CBT, workbooks, etc.) as permitted by the course syllabi. Voluntary self-study prior to
   course start date does not count as training time start date. See paragraph 1.7.1.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and Chapters 2 and 6 of this publication.
During formal training, aircrews may complete (and receive credit) for Mobility Training and
Ancillary Training events in Table 4.2. See the appropriate formal training course syllabus.
   2.3.1. All events in Table 2.1 may be accomplished at formal school or in-unit during
   mission qualification/certification training. Do not delay graduation from FTU awaiting
   ground training. A Flight Physical, Physiological Training, G002, LL01, LL03 and SS01 are
   prerequisites prior to the first aircraft flight. The FTU will provide the gaining unit with
   documentation indicating completion of items from Table 2.1.
   2.3.2. Completion of initial SERE schools according to AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion,
   Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Operations, and initial aircrew flight equipment
   familiarization (during formal school) will establish the follow-on due dates (based on the
   date first completing the course) for recurring training requirements.

 NOTES:
 1. Required prior to first aircraft flight. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until
 required training is accomplished. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous
 physical, and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                        31


 first. The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual physical
 limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days.
 2. Accomplish SS02 or SS05 if more than 36 months since completion of SS-19, SS20 or
 SS32.
 3. Crewmembers in initial qualification or requalification are required to complete prior to
 flying to destinations OCONUS.
 4. AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. IAW
 AFI 11-202 Volume 1, paragraph 6, refer to reference publications which provide guidance for
 accomplishment of ancillary training requirements.
 5. Accomplish within 30 days of initial assignment or PCS per AFI 11-218, Aircraft
 Operations and Movement on the Ground.
 6. Not required for BAQ, BMC crewmembers (i.e. crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM
 Headquarters, NAF, 618th AOC (TACC), and USAF Expeditionary Center), or Senior Officers.
 7. Required prior to first flight at home station; students attending training at a location other
 than their permanent assigned base require SS01 prior to first flight at the training location as
 well.
 8. To be certified as mission ready the individual is only required to submit the application for
 passport.
 9. Prior MWS Initial VTRAT does not satisfy the requirement of VT01. Prior MWS crew
 members must attend VT01 for the KC-10.
 10. For Flight Engineers and Boom Operators, only the Iridium Phone training portion of G080
 is required.
 11. If assigned Flight Surgeon has completed S-V80-A, log SS20 and not SS19.
2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1; AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1, Chapter 3
and Attachment 3; and published KC-10 course syllabi.
2.5. Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements. When possible, qualified
personnel in other units will provide the initial cadre. In some instances, it will be necessary for
units to form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification
requirements may be waived. The following conditions will apply to the management of initial
cadre aircrew qualification:
   2.5.1. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to begin
   aircrew conversion/differences training. Converting units may request initial cadre waiver of
   primary aircraft inventory (PAI) time requirement. Send waiver request through MAJCOM
   training staff in the format in paragraph 1.5.9. Additionally, include the most recent aircraft
   flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section.
       2.5.1.1. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held,
       e.g. C-130 mission pilot (MP) to KC-10 examiner pilot (EP), unless previously qualified
       at that level in the conversion aircraft, i.e. prior KC-10 EP.
 32                            AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


       2.5.1.2. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors
       and flight examiners by crew qualification.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for
dual qualification in different MDS aircraft. Crewmembers maintaining dual qualification in
different model aircraft will, as a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each
aircraft (N/A for senior officers; see paragraph 2.7).
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Training Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 identifies
senior officer qualification requirements. Senior Officer Course (SOC) graduates will be
assigned FTL E for continuation training purposes, and will not fly unsupervised in a primary
crew position (see paragraph 4.3.1.5).
   2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and with OG/CC approval, senior
   officers (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or
   qualification. The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements
   based on the senior officer‘s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system.
   AMC/A3T or appropriate MAJCOM/A3T will approve the proposed training plan prior to
   execution.
   2.7.1. (TRAVIS) 60 OSS/OST or 349 OSF/OST will determine and coordinate training
   requirements with AMC/A3TK and the squadron which the senior officer is assigned or
   attached to. Documentation of additional training will be kept on file at 60 OSS/OST, 349
   OSF/OST, or squadron DOT (if applicable) in accordance with Attachment 2 (aircrew
   training documentation).
   2.7.2. In order to keep the course length to a minimum, and maximize the students‘ training
   time, a suite of CBT lessons must be viewed prior to attendance at the Senior Officer Course.
   These CBT lessons can be found at https://www.kc10ats.com .Contact AMC/A3TK for
   assistance (DSN 779-2553).
   2.7.3. (Added-TRAVIS) 60 AMW Only: POC for all Travis Senior Officer Courses is 60
   OSS/OSTT.
   2.7.4. (Added-TRAVIS) 349 AMW Only: POC for all Reserve Travis Senior Officer
   Courses is 349 OSF/OST.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log
time in their primary MDS while in training for initial (mission) qualification. See paragraph
3.5.5 for training requirements.
2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of
the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Table 4.4, Note 5 and Table 4.5, Note 3), failure of a periodic or spot evaluation, when down-
graded by the Sq/CC, or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (unless
authorized multiple qualifications). The duration of unqualified time is from the date the aircrew
member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For Active Duty Service
Commitments for aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107. See AFI 11-202 Volume 1 for additional
requalification training limits and requirements.
   2.9.1. Individuals requalifying as KC-10 crewmembers will complete in-unit or formal
   school training (IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1) and accomplish those mission
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                     33


   qualification/certification events from Tables 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, and 4.2 that have expired or
   are overdue.
       2.9.1.1. A thorough review of the individual‘s flying training/history documentation will
       be conducted by appropriate training authority (Sq/DOT for in-unit requalification, or
       FTU if formal school requalification) and items to be accomplished during the
       requalification will be determined. These items will be annotated on the AF 4024 in the
       individual‘s training folder and specified on the in-unit requalification letter if applicable.
   2.9.2. Former KC-10 instructors may accomplish instructor requalification concurrent with
   basic requalification (in-unit or formal course) for their crew position. In all cases of loss of
   qualification exceeding 39 months, all special qualifications and certifications must be re-
   accomplished. If the gaining squadron commander determines that the individual requires
   additional seasoning prior to performing instructor duties, an individual can be certified as an
   aircraft commander (pilots) or basic qualification (flight engineers/boom operators) until the
   squadron commander determines the individual is ready to be certified as an instructor.
   2.9.3. Requalification Training Courses. Unqualified crew members will complete the
   appropriate TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 (longest to shortest) courses outlined below.
       2.9.3.1. Pilot, Flight Engineer, and Boom Operator TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses:
           2.9.3.1.1. Unqualified KC-10 crewmembers (over 8 years) will complete the Initial
           Qualification (PIQ, ACIQ, FIQ, BBQ) formal school flying training course (TX-1)
           and a flight evaluation. An active duty or reserve service commitment is required.
           2.9.3.1.2. Unqualified KC-10 crewmembers (greater than 39 months at the end of a
           non-flying assignment or 51 months at the end of any active flying assignment up to 8
           Years) will complete the Requalification (PRQ, FRQ, BRQ) formal school flying
           training course (TX-2) as appropriate and a flight evaluation. An active duty or
           reserve service commitment is required.
           2.9.3.1.3. Unqualified KC-10 crewmembers (up to 39 months at the end of a non-
           flying assignment or 51 months at the end of any active flying assignment) will
           complete a Sq/CC directed requalification (TX-3) course in-unit and a flight
           evaluation. Note: The Requalification formal school flying training courses in
           2.9.3.1.2 may be substituted for the in-unit training. An active duty or reserve service
           commitment is required if the formal course option is utilized.
              2.9.3.1.3.1. Squadron Commanders may tailor or expand the TX-3 course based
              on individual proficiency and experience. Unqualified pilots will complete
              training in all delinquent items, additional training as directed by the squadron
              commander, and a flight evaluation. The flying unit Sq/CC will determine
              requirements for accomplishment of events from Table 3.2 that are not
              continuation training events, e.g. M260, Fighter Deployment Operations.
2.10. Formal Training Unit (FTU) Guidance. The KC-10 Formal Training Units conduct training
at two schoolhouses located at Travis AFB and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst . Specific course
information is located in Attachment 3 and KC-10 formal course syllabi located at the following

                                             Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum mission ready criteria and training
requirements to be accomplished during mission certification training (MCT). Except where
specifically stated, squadrons may arrange mission sequence or sequence of items as necessary to
use flying training hours effectively and accomplish the unit mission. All crewmembers will
complete initial qualification (Phase IA/IB) and MCT, but are not necessarily required to be
certified in the unit‘s mission before entering special certification (i.e. large formation, formation
lead, etc.) training. Crewmembers in MCT may participate in exercises (see paragraph 1.6.2).
   3.1.1. Mission certification is the primary certification and must be completed prior to
   crewmembers deploying.
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Certification Training. See Table 1.2 and Table A3.3.
During this period crewmembers will complete remaining requirements from Table 2.1, the
ground training requirements in Table 3.1 and flying training requirements in Table 3.2. Upon
successful completion, a crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after review and certification
by Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R&C) Board for all aircraft commanders (AC) and all
instructor candidates according to AFI 11-202V2 AMC Sup.
   3.2.1. Upon completion of all MCT requirements from Tables 3.1 and 3.2, PCO, ACIQ and
   PRQ graduates will be counted as MR pilots for SORTS and TRP purposes and may fly as an
   FPQ on any crew, including operational missions. PCO, ACIQ and PRQ graduates are not
   MPs and may not fly as pilot-in-command until formally certified by the Sq/CC. See
   paragraph 5.2 for additional requirements for Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) pilot
   certification as aircraft commander.
   3.2.2. Crewmembers flying during MCT (who are current and qualified in the aircraft) may
   fly without an instructor of like specialty on CONUS-only sorties. See paragraph 3.3.1 for
   minimum ground training requirements.
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers will accomplish any remaining events
from Table 2.1 that were not previously accomplished while at the FTU and the applicable
events from Table 3.1. Complete all academic ground training events required for mission
certification in the unit operational mission (not applicable for senior officers or staff officers
maintaining BAQ). Training may be accomplished concurrently with other training.
   3.3.1. Local training and CONUS missions may be flown before completing all events,
   provided Aircraft Marshalling Exam (G002), Flight Physical, Physiological Training,
   Aircrew Flight Equipment Familiarization (LL01), Egress Training (LL03) and Local Area
   Survival (SS01) are accomplished.
   3.3.2. Graduates of the formal Pilot Check Out Course need only accomplish ground training
   events in which they have lost currency.
   3.3.3. If required, complete formal course training events not accomplished at formal school.
   3.3.4. The ATS contractor post-graduate questionnaire will be completed by the student
   prior to the individual being declared mission ready.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                    35


    3.3.5. Certified or qualified MR crewmembers transferring between units will require a
    Flight Medicine clearance from the gaining base, Aircraft Ground Marshaling Training and
    Examination (G002), ISOPREP Review (G120), Aircrew Flight Equipment Familiarization
    (LL01), Local Area Survival (SS01), and unit-specific MR training events (and events in
    which they may have lost currency during the change-of-station). See paragraphs 1.12.1 and
    3.4.2 for additional information.
    3.3.6. Ground training events accomplished during MCT establish the crewmembers due
    dates for subsequent continuation training. Completion of Combat SERE Training, Wartime
    Level C (SS20) or Evasion Conduct After Capture (SS19) (FS Only), Water Survival
    Training, Non-Parachuting (SS32), and initial Aircrew Flight Equipment Familiarization
    (during formal school) establishes the due date (based on date of first completed course) for
    recurring Combat SERE Training (SS02), Conduct After Capture (SS03), Water Survival
    Training (SS05), and Aircrew Flight Equipment Training (LL06). Completion of SS20 or
    SS19 (FS only) also establishes the due date for recurring Laws of Armed Conflict (G100).

   requirements will be prorated for all upgrade students (not initial qualification or
   requalification students), through the day prior to the first successful aircraft flight portion of
   their checkride (see Table 4.6). Crewmembers will credit all events accomplished during
   Phase IA, Phase IB and MCT IAW paragraph 4.4.1. Crewmembers pursuing MR status who
   fail to accomplish minimum aircrew requirements (currency and semi-annual) must fly in a
   supervised status when that event is required for a particular flight until the delinquent event
   or currency is corrected.
   3.4.2. After arrival at the duty station following a PCS from the other KC-10 main operating
   base (MOB), crewmembers will receive a local area briefing and supervised local orientation
   flight. The lack of a local briefing and local flight does not preclude the crewmember from
   deploying as MR. Crewmember must accomplish all grounding items prior to the local
   orientation flight. See paragraphs 1.12.1 and 3.3.5 for additional information.
   3.4.2. (TRAVIS) 60 AMW Only: All pilots will fly on a local orientation flight with an
   instructor pilot. The IP will point out local flying area patterns, restrictions, procedures, etc.
   3.4.3. MPD Pilots selected for PCO upgrade certification training must re-accomplish all
   applicable events in Table 3.2, except for N013, N014, P260, P270, P280, and P290, with an
   emphasis on aircraft commander duties and responsibilities prior to certification.

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency and qualification. The unit commander will ensure
crewmembers receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. KC-10 crewmembers are assigned to Mission Ready (MR), Non-Mission
Ready (NMR), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status.
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS),
   operational tasking, and deployments, a MR crewmember is defined as one who is available
   and certified in the squadron‘s mission (completed qualification and mission certification
   training for applicable crew position).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See
   paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in
   required continuation training.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A non-mission ready (NMR) crewmember assigned
   to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618th AOC (TACC), USAF Expeditionary Center,
   Contingency Response Wing (CRW), or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) who has satisfactorily
   completed mission certification training and does not maintain MR status, but maintains
   familiarization in the command or unit‘s operational mission
       4.2.3.1. The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission
       and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days.
       4.2.3.2. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or examiner time for the portion of the
       mission for which they are current and qualified and performing instructor or examiner
       duties. Otherwise, they will log FP, FF or FB time.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the
   requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events
   in the ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables in Chapter 4.
4.3. Flying Training Levels.
   4.3.1. The Sq/CC assigns crewmember Flying Training Levels (FTL) (see paragraph
   1.4.6.5). NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618th AOC
   (TACC), USAF Expeditionary Center, CRW, or a DRU are normally categorized as BMC
   and assigned FTL A or E. FTL A individuals may fly unsupervised on CONUS training
   missions provided they are current and qualified.
       4.3.1.1. FTL A–Highly Experienced Crewmembers (including BAQ Highly Experienced
       Crewmembers pursuing MR status). As a guide, crewmembers having 10 or more years
       of operational flying experience (i.e., MR or NMR MAJCOM headquarters staff and
 40                            AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


       618th AOC (TACC) personnel; FTU instructors; NAF personnel; USAFEC instructors,
       WG/CC, OG/CC, and Sq/CC, operations officers, crewmembers assigned to OG
       evaluation positions, and instructors assigned primarily to staff duties). Sq/CC may
       assign highly experienced MR line crewmembers to FTL A.
       4.3.1.2. FTL B–Experienced MR Crewmember (including BAQ Experienced
       Crewmembers pursuing MR status). As a guide, crewmembers having between 5-10
       years of operational flying experience.
       4.3.1.3. FTL C–MR Crewmember. Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers and
       inexperienced individuals pursuing MR status after initial qualification training to FLT C.
       As a guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational flying experience.
       4.3.1.4. FTL D–No longer used.
       4.3.1.5. FTL E–BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. This training level may include senior
       officers, MAJCOM, NAF, 618th AOC (TACC), CRW, and DRU staff who are not
       maintaining MR or instructor status. FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status and
       crewmembers assigned to this FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. Exception: Units associating FTLs with crew positions may
   change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade. BAQ crewmembers may be placed into a
   different FTL any time after attaining MR status. Prorate events upon changing training levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
can be found in Chapter 7. Unit defined events will be designated ―X‖ events (i.e. X020) and
listed in local supplement. Proration of training information can be found in Table 4.6 and
paragraph 4.8 of this AFI.
4.4. (TRAVIS)60 AMW Only: Local ―X‖ events will be listed and defined within the ―X‖
event letter signed by the OG/CC and maintained by 60 OSS/OST SharePoint website.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Crewmembers may credit events accomplished
   during training, MCT, operational missions, and satisfactory evaluations toward currency
   requirements and establish a subsequent due date. They must be qualified in the events and
   either current or under the supervision of an instructor. Use date of evaluation as the date of
   accomplishment for all flying training currency events that were trained during the formal
   course. Crewmembers may credit G240, G250, and G292 refresher training upon
   satisfactory completion of evaluation of any formal course for the current quarter (use the
   evaluation date as the date of accomplishment). ATS courses are listed in Table 6.2 (see
   paragraph 4.8 for proration). For upgrade students (not initial qualification or requalification
   students), continuation training events accomplished during upgrade training prior to the
   evaluation are credited towards the requirements for the current crew position. Do not log
   training events for the upgrading crew position prior to the evaluation.
   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation , do not log continuation training events items
   graded Q-3 (according to AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 2) until re-qualified.
   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period. For
   G220, flight engineers must accomplish systems refresher material for the missed quarter.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                41


   4.4.4. Instructors and flight examiners may credit 50 percent of their total training
   requirements while instructing or evaluating. Exception: Instructor and Flight Examiner
   pilots may not credit any takeoffs, landings, or receiver air-to-air refueling (rendezvous may
   be credited) flown by another pilot. Instructor and examiner boom operators must
   accomplish all their own contacts.
   4.4.5. Records and Documentation. Units will use AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional
   Training Accomplishment Report prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, to record training
   accomplishments. Course instructors will deliver these forms to the appropriate scheduling
   and training documentation sections within one duty day after the class is taught. Combat
   arms training (G280) will be recorded on AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training
   Data IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Ground Training Events. Completion and tracking of continuation training is the
   responsibility of the individual crewmember. Crewmembers shall actively work with unit
   schedulers and training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as
   described in this chapter.
   4.5.1. (TRAVIS) A consolidated list of ground continuation training events, including local
   requirements and dual credits, is located on the OST SharePoint under Event Description
   Report (EDR). It details each event and how they are accomplished at Travis.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Tables
   4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.
      4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 or noted events of Table 4.3 leads to
      non-mission ready status. See paragraph 4.9 for regaining mission ready status.
      4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
      non-mission ready status but may restrict member from certain missions requiring the
      associated training. Staff crewmembers (i.e. MAJCOM, NAF, 618th AOC (TACC),
      USAF EC, etc.) may accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit
      of attachment. The crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training
      events to their unit of attachment (ARMS office).
      4.5.2.3. Ancillary Training. See paragraph 4.7.
      4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 72-hours) may
      accomplish ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission
      accomplishment. Specify requirements and or restriction in MAJCOM supplement and
      local supplement.
      4.5.2.4. (TRAVIS) Crewmembers will coordinate any applicable ground training
      through their Aircraft Commander and unit chain of command (or C2 agency if away
      from home station).
      4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3.
      4.5.2.6. All training events will be recorded in ARMS.
          4.5.2.6.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
          consolidated under one ARMS entry.
 42                            AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


           4.5.2.6.2. Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry.
           4.5.2.6.3. Input all one-time events and events required for Permanent Change-of-
           Station (PCS) in the ARMS database. Do not maintain these events on the
           crewmembers' currency reports.
           4.5.2.6.4. (Added-TRAVIS) 60 AMW Only: In order to alleviate confusion and
           meet the intent of AFI33-201V2, paragraph 5, all boom operators and flight
           engineers will attend G080, Communications Procedures, in its entirety to earn credit
           for Iridium phone training.

NOTES:
1. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished. Flight
physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on
the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or
individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days.
2. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.9.3.
3. CONUS sorties not requiring this event may be accomplished while non-current for this event (see para
4.9.3.1).
4. Should be accomplished during G292 for boom operators.
5. Physiological Training expires 5 years after the last day of the month in which previously accomplished.
6. Not required for BAQ, BMC crewmembers (i.e. crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM Headquarters,
NAF, 618th AOC (TACC), and USAF Expeditionary Center), or Senior Officers unless specified in this AFI
or AOR SPINS.
7. Frequency is semi-annual for MAJCOM, NAF, and AFMC Boom Operators.
8. Pilots on active flying status must complete the IRC every fourth quarter after completion IAW AFMAN
11-210, Instrument Refresher Program (IRP) and AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
9. OG/CCs may specify an alternate frequency for Tactics training, but not less than ―Annual.‖
10. Flight Physical, Physiological Training, and Flight Records Review are all tracked on the top of each
crewmember‘s Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore, there is no longer a need to assign and track
these training events in the training module of ARMS.
11. AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. IAW AFI 11-
202 Volume 1, paragraph 6, refer to reference publications which provide guidance for accomplishment of
ancillary training requirements.
12. Iridium Phone portion of G080 is only required for Flight Engineers and Boom Operators.

NOTES:
1. Mandatory grounding item.
2. Flight Surgeons without an aviation unit mobility requirement (e.g. non-operational staff or leadership
role in Aerospace Medicine, and Flight Surgeons undergoing training in the USAF Residency in
Aerospace Medicine) do not need to accomplish this training.
3. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.9.
4. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or change in MDS.
5. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the 455th day or as
indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may vary to address
waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will
exceed 455 days.
6. AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. IAW AFI 11-
202 Volume 1, Paragraph 6, refer to AF/A3O-AT reference publications for current ancillary training
frequencies. See event description in Chapter 7 for additional information.
7. S-V80-A establishes an initial training completion date for SS02, SS03, and SS20. S-V88-AL
establishes an initial training completion date for SS02, SS03, and SS19.
8. Flight surgeons must fly at least 50 percent of their annual minimum requirements in primary unit
aircraft unless deployed away from their primary unit for more than 90 days.
9. Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one sortie per single
calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual and annual sortie requirements.
10. A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight duration or
one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in AFI 11-401.
11. See para 4.5.3.5

       4.5.3. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 list standardized
       flying continuation training requirements. See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
          4.5.3.1. ATD Credit for Training Requirements. Flight events creditable in the ATDs
          are listed in Tables 4.4 and 4.5. For ARMS tracking, simulator events will be logged
          with an ―S‖ prefixed task ID in ARMS. All simulator accomplishments must be
          documented and tracked in ARMS.
          4.5.3.2. As a minimum, Senior Officers and all other crewmembers maintaining BMC or
          BAQ status in the KC-10 will maintain FTL E requirements. Senior Officers on MR
          status will comply with Table 4.4. FTL E crewmembers must always fly with an
          instructor of like specialty. This requirement also applies to additional aircraft an
          individual may be qualified in (see multiple qualifications). See AFI 11-2KC10V3, AFI
          11-202, V1, and AFI 11-401 for additional restrictions when flying with passengers.
          4.5.3.3. Continuation Training Flying. Each MAJCOM provides flying hours to each
          wing as training, test, and ferry hours or operations and maintenance (O&M) hours. The
          hours, based on FTL C, are designed to provide all crew positions with sufficient hours to
          accomplish all continuation flying training requirements.
          4.5.3.4. Mission profile and refresher simulators will be flown in the same manner as the
          aircraft, to include the wear and use of professional gear (headsets, helmets, etc.).
               4.5.3.4.1. Simulator sorties will be scheduled as ground events in GDSS (if able) and
               sortie cancellation authority will reside with the OG/CC (or designated
               representative).
               4.5.3.4.2. Pre-requisites for simulator training must be completed prior to the sim
               start time or the training will be cancelled. AFRC members should accomplish CBTs
               prior to sims, but the sortie will not be cancelled if this is not accomplished.
          4.5.3.5. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply
          with the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Flight surgeons require
          one sortie in any qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 table for
          flying continuation-training requirements. See paragraph 4.9.1.2.3 for regaining mission
          ready status.

4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Flight surgeons require one sortie
in any qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 table for flying continuation
training requirements. Flight surgeons that are fully qualified in their primary unit aircraft, can
fly as a crewmember on any USAF aircraft provided they receive the required basic egress
training from a qualified crewmember for that aircraft. See Table 4.3 for flight surgeon ground
continuation training requirements.
    4.6.1. Any flight surgeon logging time in this MDS as a secondary airframe, or any AMC-
    assigned flight surgeon logging time in any DoD or foreign military aircraft in which they are
    granted authorization to fly by the local unit, must be on Aeronautical Orders assigning ASC
    8A status and be current in their periodic flight physical and physiological training. The AC
    or their designated crewmember must also give FS a briefing on oxygen equipment and
    egress procedures prior to flight. Note: Initial Qualification requirements (in Chapters 2 and
    3) only apply to the Flight Surgeon's primary aircraft.
        4.6.1.1. For contingency/AOR missions, Flight Surgeons must also be current in the
        following events (in their primary aircraft): SS02, SS03, SS19 (S-V88-AL) or SS20 (S-
        V80-A) and G120. Note: Other AOR requirements not listed in this AFI also will be
        completed IAW AMC OPORD.
4.7. Ancillary Training. Ancillary Training is guidance or instruction that contributes to
mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI
11-2KC-10 Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events.
In accordance with AFI 11-202 Volume 1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these
events unless an approved waiver has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger
representative to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements.
4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements
for crewmembers not available for flying duties. See Para 3.4.1 for proration of students. In
addition, prorate training for non-availability due to contingency alerts and contingency flying
TDYs when the contingency precludes training for certain mission events. This authority must
 52                           AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same crewmember for consecutive semi-
annual training periods.
   4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: number of months available
   times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down
   to the nearest whole number (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5), but not less than 1 unless the individual
   was available for less than 15 days during the SA period.
       4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.6 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
       absence is at least 15 cumulative days. For contingency alerts and contingency flying
       TDYs non-consecutive periods of non-availability can be combined for proration
       purposes.
       4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
       to a unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
       accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
       available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
       available) during the training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for
       CONUS and 14-days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment
       of the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments
       from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
   4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.        If
   requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they 1) fail to
maintain flying currencies from Tables 4.4 and 4.5, 2) fail to complete semi-annual flying
continuation training requirements from Tables 4.4 and 4.5, or 3) fail to complete ground
continuation training requirements from Table 4.1 or Table 4.3. for Flight Surgeons. The
following guidance applies:
4.9. (TRAVIS)Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Squadrons will notify 60
OSS/OST or 349 OSF/OST (via e-mail attachment or hardcopy) at least semiannually annotating
any semi-annual events which were not accomplished during the training period. This
notification will serve to maintain continuity of NMR crewmembers when the ARMS tables roll
to the new training period and prevent consecutive waivers. 60 OG use 60 OSS/OST format and
squadron letterhead. Specify the number and type of events that were not completed and also
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                53


specify if the squadron intends to pursue a waiver for the items or require training to regain
mission-ready (MR) status. The squadron will maintain the master copy of each letter and
annotate in pen the date each event is completed and the date the individual is returned to MR
status. OST will provide a central share point location for scanned copies of these letters to
facilitate cross flow of information and MR status between flying squadrons.
   4.9.1. Failure to Maintain Flying Currency (Tables 4.4 and 4.5)
   4.9.1. (TRAVIS) Aircrew members filling deployment requirements to KC-10 flying units
   should remain current throughout the duration of their deployment. See Paragraph 1.5.8
   (TRAVIS) For waivers while deployed.
       4.9.1.1. Flight Training Currency. Flight currency is associated with those events
       denoted in the flying continuation training tables by a specific period of time (monthly,
       quarterly, semi-annual, or annually) within which an event must be accomplished. A
       currency event must be accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to
       maintain the currency.
       4.9.1.2. Loss of Currency. Place individuals non-current in one or more currency events
       in supervised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions
       requiring that event. Crewmembers are ―non-current‖ the following calendar day after
       event currency expires (i.e. a crewmember, who accomplished a monthly currency event
       on 5 September, becomes non-current on 1 November).
          4.9.1.2.1. For all non-current events, place individuals in supervised training status
          for that event and declare them NMR in unit missions requiring the event. The
          crewmember cannot deploy and may not fly unsupervised OCONUS until currency is
          regained. Loss of currency prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised
          in-flight duties in the non-current event(s). EXAMPLE: If the individual is non-
          current for tanker air refueling, the individual may fly unsupervised on CONUS
          sorties which are not scheduled for and do not accomplish tanker air refueling.
          4.9.1.2.2. A Pilot non-current in Takeoff (P010 or P020), Landings (P190),
          Approaches (P070), or Refresher WST (G250) will not fly unsupervised on any
          sortie. A Pilot non-current in Formation (F020) may regain currency under the
          supervision of an IP in another aircraft of the formation if instructor manning
          prevents direct IP supervision. The optimum position for the IP is the last aircraft so
          they may monitor all aircraft of the formation.
          4.9.1.2.3. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM
          Command Surgeon of Flight Surgeons exceeding 60-days between sorties (AMC
          units send notification to AMC/SGP and local MDG/CC). Flight surgeons that
          exceed 60 days between sorties require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems
          conducted by a member of the flight crew designated by the Aircraft Commander
          (AC) prior to the flight to regain flying currency.
              4.9.1.2.3.1. The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the
              AMC/SGP memo or other approved form (e.g., AF 1522, locally generated
              form/memo, etc.). Note: documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable. The
              Flight surgeon must submit this documentation to the local Squadron/Host
              Aviation Resource Manager (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or upon return
54                           AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


            to home station if the flight is in conjunction with a TDY. The HARM or SARM
            will place the documentation in the flight surgeon‘s training folder.
            4.9.1.2.3.2. Failure to complete and document required training before the flight
            will result in the loss of ability to log primary flight surgeon time.
     4.9.1.3. Regaining Currency.
         4.9.1.3.1. Loss of Currency up to 6-Months. Crewmembers maintain their current
         training level and no training folder is required. Crewmember must demonstrate
         proficiency in the aircraft or WST (as appropriate) in all delinquent items while under
         supervision of an Air Force instructor (or ATS contract instructor when Table 4.4 or
         4.5 permits regaining currency in the ATD).
         4.9.1.3.2. Loss of Currency exceeding 6-Months.             Crewmember is declared
         Unqualified for a loss of currency for events specified in Table 4.4, Note 5 and Table
         4.5, Note 3. The crewmember will complete Sq/CC directed requalification training
         (and evaluation, if required) according to AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 2. For all other
         currency events, regain currency by demonstrating proficiency in the aircraft or WST
         to the satisfaction of an Air Force instructor (or ATS contract instructor when Tables
         4.4 or 4.5 permits regaining currency in the ATD) in all delinquent items.
            4.9.1.3.2.1. Flight Surgeons that exceed 6-months between sorties require
            completion of LL03, Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat, with a
            certified aircrew instructor prior to the next flight.
  4.9.2. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events (Tables 4.4 and 4.5).
     4.9.2.1. The Sq/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each semi-annual training
     period. For individuals who fail to accomplish training requirements, the Sq/CC will
     place individuals in supervised training status for the event(s) and declare them NMR in
     those unit missions requiring the event(s), or request an OG/CC Waiver for the
     requirement (paragraph 1.5.8).
         4.9.2.1.1. If OG/CC waiver is not accomplished, place individuals who have failed
         to complete semi-annual flying training events in supervised status for the event(s)
         (crewmember flies with an instructor of like specialty) until SQ/CC directed re-
         training is accomplished. The crewmember cannot deploy or fly unsupervised until
         Sq/CC directed re-training is accomplished. Failure to complete semi-annual flying
         training events prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight
         duties in those events. This includes aircrew members in MCT training assigned a
         FTL C upon completion of their evaluation.
         4.9.2.1.2. A Pilot who failed to complete Formation (F020) continuation training
         events may regain MR status under the supervision of an IP in another aircraft of the
         formation if instructor manning prevents direct IP supervision. The optimum position
         for the IP is the last aircraft so they may monitor all aircraft of the formation.
  4.9.3. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events (Table 4.1 or Table 4.3 for Flight
  Surgeons).
     4.9.3.1. Individuals who fail to complete ground training requirements are declared
     NMR. The crewmember cannot deploy or fly unsupervised until currency is regained
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                 55


      (Exception: Noncurrent crewmembers may fly unsupervised on local, routine, and
      CONUS missions according to Table 4.1 on sorties not requiring the ground training
      event.).
          4.9.3.1.1. An individual NMR for failure to complete Hazardous Cargo Training
          (G182) may fly unsupervised on local training missions only with Sq/CC approval
          until training is completed.
      4.9.3.2. Waivers for Ground Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive
      ground continuation training events identified by Note 2 of Table 4.1 or Table 4.3 for
      Flight Surgeons. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the individual
      crewmember‘s experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on a
      crewmember‘s availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the
      waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This
      waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade
      mission accomplishment.
   4.9.4. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
4.10. Requirements Before PCS Or TDY By Members On Active Flying Status. See AFI
11-202, Volume 1.
4.11. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
4.12. Requirements While In Inactive Flying Status. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
4.13. Retraining. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies retraining restrictions before separation,
retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status.
4.14. Aircrew Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force Units. See
AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
4.15. Training Period. Continuation training program is based on static 6-month period, for
example: 1 January - 30 June or 1 July - 31 December.

    5.1.1. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for minimum prerequisites for entry into
    upgrade programs.
    5.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Identification for Upgrade.             Squadrons should ensure that
    individuals identified for upgrade training have the ability, experience, and prerequisites for
    the next level of qualification. If class candidates do not meet flying hour minimums the
    flying squadron will initiate an electronic waiver web request through OST and OG/CC.
    Squadrons should use the Squadron TRP as the venue to identify aircrew members for
    upgrade. Training managers should provide recommendations for upgrade, as well as
    support for those recommendations, to the Sq/CC or DO at the STRP. All those identified
    for upgrade will be entered for record in the STRP minutes.
        5.1.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) OSTT will supervise the formal training class schedule. All
        class types and dates will be provided to the flying squadrons two weeks after the initial
        Programmed Flying Training (PFT) is received from AMC. Squadrons should provide
        all class attendee names to OSTT a minimum of 60 days prior to class start date. OG/CC
        waivers, if required, will be requested and approved prior to submitting class attendee
        names or requesting classes in order to prevent cancellation.

NOTES:
1. Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a military
pilot including UPT ―student‖ and ―other‖ time (but does not include time in another aircrew specialty).
Simulator time is creditable to meet TFT requirement.
2. Minimum of 100 KC-10 hours PAA required (does not include ―other‖, Phase IB, or simulator time)
before R&C to perform AC duties.

3. For MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e. KC-135, C-17, etc.), MPD Phase II guide is not
required. Pilots with dissimilar background (i.e. OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc), accomplish MPD Phase II
guide in-unit
5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). Mobility Pilot Development is the development
program leading to Aircraft Commander certification. The MPD program flows from Pilot
Initial Qualification (PIQ) or Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) formal training
courses through continuation training to upgrade selection and culminates in certification as an
Aircraft Commander. MPD continuation training is divided into three phases: MPD Phase I
(V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified
and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 2. MPD pilots are
not Aircraft Commanders. See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1.
5.2. (TRAVIS)Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). 60 AMW Only: Prior to starting the
PCO program, candidates should complete all applicable special qualifications and certifications
outlined in the basic instruction and this supplement. If all applicable special qualifications and
certifications have not been accomplished prior to the beginning of upgrade it will be left to the
discretion of the squadron commander if the individual will commence the program or delay to
complete the remaining training. Any special qualification or certification incomplete prior to
starting PCO should be completed during MCT prior to AC certification.
   5.2.1. The success of this program depends on MPD pilots being mentored and provided
   with development opportunities. The upgrade training timeline to Aircraft Commander is
   based on performance and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, should be tailored to match an
   individual‘s capabilities and experience level.
5.3. MPD Continuation Training thru Aircraft Commander Upgrade.
   5.3.1. Documentation. Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as
   V280 and V281 respectively; GRACC is documented in ARMS as V282. Document the
   completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and Sq/CC certification.
   5.3.2. Training Guides. MPD Phase I & II guides are available for download on the
   AMC/A3T CoP. Guides should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities.
   5.3.3. MPD Phase I (V280). After completion of the PIQ course, pilots enter MPD Phase I
   of continuation training. This first phase consists of completing the MPD Phase I guide,
   which focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication, checklist discipline,
   systems knowledge, and basic mission planning. A Phase I MPD should not have additional
   squadron duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commander, yet they should observe
   and learn from their aircrew leadership.
       5.3.3.1. During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the
       right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP. Phase I MPD pilots will
       train in the right seat during refresher WSTs and may occupy the left or right seats for
       proficiency WSTs (and available proficiency time at the end of a refresher WST). Phase
       I MPD pilots will complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180 days (365 days for ARC)
       after becoming mission ready.
       5.3.3.2. In order to advance beyond MPD Phase I, the Phase I MPD pilot must be at least
       6 months from the training start date (as defined in 1.7.1), have a minimum of 200 PAA
58                           AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


     (aircraft) hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide. Once these requirements
     are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for MPD Phase II via the STRP. (Note:
     MPD pilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI may continue under
     the previous GRACC workbook for up to 6 months beyond the release date of this AFI at
     Sq/CC discretion, but will comply with all other requirements in this paragraph). For
     FAIP/OSA or non-mobility weapon system pilots transitioning to MAF aircraft,
     completion of V280 is not required; however, V281 and V282 are required.
     5.3.3.3. Receiver A/R training for MPD pilots may be accomplished anytime with an IP
     (as long as passengers are not on-board). MPD pilots may be entered into a certification
     program IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 1, paragraph 5.6.7. MPD pilots should be
     certified in Q583, MPD Receiver Air-to-Air Refueling, prior to entering PCO. This
     refueling may be accomplished in either seat.
  5.3.4. MPD Phase II (V281). This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide,
  which focuses on the core tasks of flying skills, mission situational awareness, and crew
  management required for Aircraft Commander certification.
     5.3.4.1. Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats
     in the aircraft with an AC or above. Good judgment and Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy. As Phase II MPD
     pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management
     skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP.
     5.3.4.1. (TRAVIS) 60 AMW Only: MPD Phase II pilots may operate the aircraft from
     the left seat during all phases of flight while under direct supervision of an IP or an AC
     that has at least 150 hours since AC certification.
     5.3.4.2. MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification. Phase II
     MPD pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD
     Phase II guide. Based upon performance, experience, and requisite flight hours, Phase II
     MPD pilots will be identified for upgrade by squadron leadership via the STRP. MPD
     pilots require a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready
     certification and prior to entry into Aircraft Commander upgrade (N/A for MAF
     crossflow, FAIP/OSA, or non- mobility weapon system pilots).
     5.3.4.3. AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC (V282). This event provides an in-depth
     look at selected AMC and 618 AOC (TACC) operations as well as an opportunity to
     interact with command senior staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by Aircraft
     Commander candidates after completing V281, but before beginning formal Aircraft
     Commander upgrade training (ACU or PCO). GRACC is mandatory for AMC pilots and
     highly encouraged for PACAF, USAFE, AFRC, and ANG mobility forces pilots
     upgrading to Aircraft Commander. GRACC is transferable between all mobility weapon
     systems. For AMC pilots, V282 will be completed prior to Aircraft Commander
     certification. If unable to complete V282 prior to certification, units may schedule
     attendance up to 90 days after certification; beyond 90 days requires OG/CC approval.
     See paragraph 1.18.6 for scheduling details. Additional information is available via
     ETCA: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.

     5.3.4.3. (TRAVIS) AMC Orientation Tour (V282). Unit Training Shops shall
     coordinate and schedule individuals for V282, the AMC Orientation tour, through 60
     OSS/OSTT. This course should be reserved for Aircraft Commander Candidates within
     three months of formal Aircraft Commander upgrade training.
  5.3.5. MPD Phase III. Aircraft Commander Upgrade (ACU) or Pilot Checkout (PCO).
  After the Sq/CC determines (via the STRP) an upgrade training start date, training time
  begins and the upgrade candidate will begin applicable ACU or PCO training events, as
  required (see Table 1.2 and Table A.3.3 for training time limitations). Prior to starting
  training, the training office will open and maintain an AF Form 4022 until the upgrade
  candidate is certified as an Aircraft Commander. Units using multiple folders to document a
  pilots training progress may combine those into a single training folder at the unit‘s
  discretion. Training guides are authorized.
  5.3.5. (TRAVIS) Phase IB training folders will be opened and maintained by the FTU until
  the MPD student graduates and formally in-processes into the gaining squadron. At that time
  the gaining squadron will review the Phase IB folder in accordance with Paragraph A2.1.2
  of AFI 11-2KC-10 V1. This folder will then be used to document MPD Phase III Mission
  Certification Training (MCT). Once MCT complete, close the folder per Paragraph A2.2.9
     5.3.5.1. Current and qualified Aircraft Commander candidates accomplishing MPD
     Phase III training events require IP supervision during non-critical phases of flight and
     direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight (see course syllabi for exceptions).
     Two Aircraft Commander candidates may sit in the left and right seats under IP
     supervision in the simulator, as required.
     5.3.5.2. The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements
     prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board:
         5.3.5.2.1. The preferred method for completing Aircraft Commander upgrade
         training is by completion of the Pilot Check Out (PCO) Course conducted by the
         contractor followed by flightline training conducted by the Formal Training Unit
         (FTU). Contractor training covers emergency procedures, tactics, and Aircraft
         Commander duties. FTU training completes air-to-air refueling training. Units retain
         the option to conduct in-unit Aircraft Commander upgrades without waiver for highly
         qualified and experienced pilots.
         5.3.5.2.2. Aircraft Commander candidates must be current in applicable Mission
         Certification Training events listed in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 prior to certification.
  5.3.6. Evaluation and Certification: Prior to certification the upgrade candidate must
  demonstrate aircraft commander proficiency during an Aircraft Commander flight
  evaluation, to include receiver air-to-air refueling, IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2. ACU or
  PCO culminates with a Sq/CC‘s R&C Board recommendation.
  5.3.7. Aircrew Designation Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes. For
  standardization, use the codes from Table 5.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes the status
  for a MPD pilot who completed formal training with evaluation (graduate). During Phase IB
  training, pilots will log ―UP‖ time.).

NOTES:
Enlisted aircrew qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When AF Form 8
is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, the crewmember is qualified to perform duties
assigned for the crewmember qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight
examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct from OJT trainer or certifier designation and are
reflected in AFSC by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix (aircrew standardization and
flight examiner).
1. Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a military
pilot including UPT ―student‖ and ―other‖ time (but does not include time in another aircrew specialty).
Simulator time is creditable to meet TFT requirement.
2. Instructor Flight Engineer candidates with total flying hours logged from other than the Flight
Engineer crew position (i.e. Boom Operator, Loadmaster) require 2000 Total flying hours and 750
hours as a KC-10 Flight Engineer prior to consideration for upgrade.
3. Instructor Boom Operator candidates with total flying hours logged from other than the Boom
Operator crew position (i.e. Flight Engineer, Loadmaster) require 2000 Total flying hours and 750
hours as a KC-10 Boom Operator prior to consideration for upgrade.

5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience,
judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge. For specific instructor
upgrade prerequisites, see Table 5.3.
5.4. (TRAVIS)Aircrew Instructor Program. Reference Paragraph 1.10.2 (TRAVIS) of this
supplement for guidance on in-unit instructor upgrade. 60 AMW Only: Prior to starting the IP
upgrade process, candidates should complete all applicable special qualifications and

will be left to the discretion of the squadron commander if the individual will commence the
program or delay to complete the remaining training.
    5.4.1. Instructor candidates, who are current and qualified in the aircraft, previously attended
    a formal instructor school for instructor qualification, were qualified instructors in any US
    Air Force aircraft, and who meet the minimum flying hour requirements may upgrade in-unit
    with OG/CC approval. MAJCOM waiver is not required. Sq/CC will determine training
    required to complete the instructor upgrade in-unit, including evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2KC-

5.5. Flight Examiner Certification. Flight examiner prerequisites are in Table 5.4.
    5.5.1. Sq/CC will recommend instructors for flight examiner certification. Instructors
    identified for certification as flight examiners must possess satisfactory knowledge of
    training and evaluation policies and procedures and the ability to administer evaluations
    according to applicable publications. Flight examiner candidates should:
        5.5.1.1. Observe qualified examiners conducting a cross-section of evaluations, to
        include techniques used to evaluate aircraft systems and flight directive knowledge.
        5.5.1.2. Receive a briefing on command policies and interpretations of AFI 11-202,
        Volume 1, AFI 11-202, Volume 2, AFI 11-2KC-10, Volumes 1 and 2, and MAJCOM
        supplements.
5.6. Special Qualifications and Certifications: Certain KC-10 aircrew qualifications and
certifications are one-time events trained after completion of formal qualification. Special
qualifications and certifications may require an evaluation or an AF Form 4324 update. These
programs are usually taught at the unit level by Air Force instructors of like specialty.
5.6. (TRAVIS)Special Qualifications and Certifications. 60 AMW Only: The 60 OG/CC has
supplemented the training programs required by the basic instruction and has reserved the right to
determine the requirements to be met prior to certifications. The following certification programs

                          AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. The KC-10 ATS is a civilian contractor-provided aircrew training system.
The ATS contractor provides academic and simulator training. The Air Force conducts all flight
training and administers all evaluations. The ATS contract guarantees trained students meet
government standards. Formal ATS courses are listed in Table 6.2 and non-formal ATS courses
are listed in Table 6.3.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

 NOTES:
 1. There are two tracks available for instructor upgrade. Track I is for students that have never been
 Air Force flight instructors (the longer course that includes extra academics) and Track II is for all
 others. For Instructor Courses that include the three-day Academic Instructor Course (AIC) portion.
 If the student is a previously qualified instructor they need not accomplish this training and will start
 three days later.
 2. KC-10 FRQ requires pilot class KC-10 PRQ to be scheduled at the same time.
 3. See paragraph 2.7 for additional requirements.
 4. While planned for one student, this course can accommodate two students by doubling the
 number of BOT periods required.
 5. Squadron to which the Senior Officer is attached will provide an appropriate pilot ‗seat filler‘ to
 complement their SOC student.
 6. Course is designed for one ACIQ, one PIQ and one FIQ student or two PIQ students and one FIQ
 student.

 NOTES:
 1. This course is archived for future reference/use and are not updated nor maintained by the ATS
 contractor. They can be updated for use following AMC/A3TK notification to the contractor.
 2. This training is Computer Based training.
 3. CRM training is developed in accordance with AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
 Training Program. Training is included in the requisite Initial Qualification, Instructor Qualification,
 and Refresher courses.
 4. Course designed to teach KC-10 qualified instructors and evaluators to operate devices (WST and
 FTDs for IPs/IFEs, BOT for IBOs).

6.5. Lesson Objectives. Contractor-developed lesson objectives are based on requirements in
this instruction.
   6.5.1. The training contractor will provide KC-10 aircrew members with ground-based
   training required to meet objectives for initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, senior
   staff, differences, and continuation training.
   6.5.2. General. Recurring academic and ATD training is designed to ensure that prescribed
   subject material is presented in a realistic manner on a programmed basis. Instruction will be
   provided by instructors trained and employed by the training contractor and through course
   materials developed by the training contractor.
        6.5.2.1. Objective. Ensure all aircrews maintain proficiency required to safely operate
        the aircraft and effectively perform the assigned mission. Crewmembers will utilize
        training devices to enhance training areas that ATDs are particularity well suited to
        accomplish (e.g., wind shear and microburst training, low visibility approaches, systems
        knowledge, emergency and abnormal procedures, etc.).
   6.5.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM) training. The KC-10 ATS incorporates CRM
   principles during all phases of training including initial and continuation training to meet
   requirements of AFI 11-290. Instructors use AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria
   Training/Evaluation as prescribed in AFI 11-290, for CRM skills training.

6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. If a student's training progress is unsatisfactory the
contractor will notify their squadron commander. Following a review of the student's record the
government (Sq/CC, OSS/OST, Det 1, PO/QAR) will determine whether to continue or
terminate training.
   6.6.1. The contractor will provide written feedback to the student‘s gaining unit commander
   or training office for students who display substandard performance.
   6.6.2. Remediation Procedures. ATS contractor and PO/QAR must receive prompt
   notification of failed flight evaluations culminating an ATS course. Local procedures must
   ensure notification is completed within 24 hours of failure for local evaluations and within 24
   hours after return to home station for off-station evaluations. Remediation subsequent to a
   failed flight evaluation may be the ATS contractor‘s responsibility, Air Force‘s
   responsibility, or a joint responsibility, depending on the nature of failure. In every case,
   close coordination is required to achieve maximum trainee progress. Direct contact with
   appropriate ATS instructor supervisor is encouraged.
       6.6.2.1. Remediation Scheduling:
           6.6.2.1.1. When a trainee is required to return for remediation regarding deficient
           areas, the trainee‘s unit, appropriate wing or group training office, and ATS training
           manager will coordinate training start and completion dates.
           6.6.2.1.2. The ATS contractor will contact the trainee‘s squadron commander if a
           trainee is identified, during ATS contractor‘s instruction, to need remediation or
           additional training. If the ATS contractor determines no further amount of
           remediation or additional instruction will result in the individual attaining required
           proficiency level the contractor will expeditiously inform trainee‘s squadron
           commander verbally and follow-up in writing. As a minimum, the Air Force ATS
           PO/QAR will receive a courtesy copy of this documentation. Following a review of
           the student's record the government (Sq/CC, OSS/OST, Det 1 AMCAOS, and
           PO/QAR) will determine whether to continue or terminate training.
6.7. Courseware Changes. Changes to ATS courseware may be proposed by any KC-10
crewmember. Complete recommended change on ATS contractor‘s change proposal form and
submit to the local PO/QAR. Change proposals will be sent through wing or group training and
ATS PO/QAR offices to Det 1 AMCAOS. The Det 1 AMCAOS will coordinate with the ATS
contractor and the originator and will provide feedback to reflect action taken. Change proposal
forms are available from ATS contractor site manager at each site.
6.8. Scheduling:
   6.8.1. AMC/A3T Responsibilities:
       6.8.1.1. Submit the following fiscal year‘s student training requirements to the contractor
       no later than 31 January of the current year.
       6.8.1.2. Publish and distribute the next fiscal year‘s annual programmed flying training
       (PFT) schedule no later than 1 June of the current year.
       6.8.1.3. Coordinate changes to the current PFT with the KC-10 program management
       team and the contractor and distribute those changes.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                 79


  6.8.2. Contractor Responsibilities: (These reports are exempt from Office of Management
  and Budget review in accordance with Public Law 96-511, The Paperwork Reduction Act of
  1980, as amended, Title 44, United States Code, Chapter 35.).
     6.8.2.1. Develop and submit the following year‘s PFT to AMC/A3TF no later than 15
     Apr of the current year.
         6.8.2.1.1. Notify AMC/A3TF and A3TK prior to 15 Apr of the current year for
         resolution if yearly PFT request received by the contractor exceeds contracted PFT
         baselines from either the overall PFT numbers requested or due to contractor
         limitations.
     6.8.2.2. Provide units with a quarterly pilot, FE, and BO refresher and Additional
     Training Time (ATT) schedule no later than 45 days prior to the start of the following
     quarter. The contractor will fill any vacancies in each quarter‘s draft WST and BOT
     schedule with ATT periods. The goal is to ensure the squadrons have the opportunity to
     use 100% of available WST time as long as the contracted ATT throughput is not
     exceeded. This means the contractor should not leave an available period unscheduled in
     the draft schedule due to lack of instructor availability. The training facility manager and
     all local KC-10 squadrons will establish mutually agreeable scheduling procedures.
  6.8.3. OG/CC OPR (AFRC/A3TA) Responsibilities:
     6.8.3.1. No later than the last week in November of each year, provide AMC/A3TF with
     estimated training requirements (initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, senior
     staff, ATD refreshers, engine run, and additional simulator training time) of their units for
     the next fiscal year.
     6.8.3.2. Coordinate with AMC/A3TF when additional training slots are required.
     Additional requirements for training slots will be thoroughly justified.
     6.8.3.3. Provide Wing Formal Training with either a form letter or an annotated class
     roster indicating the date and names of crewmembers completing their evaluation.
     6.8.3.4. (Added-TRAVIS) The ATS contractor should provide 60 OSS/OSTT the
     quarterly ATS schedule 45 days prior to the start of the quarter. OSTT will allocate flight
     continuation training courses equitably for both active duty and reserve units, based on
     fiscal year through-put requirements. Squadrons will ensure requests are submitted 60
     days prior to the start of the quarter. The ATS schedule should be published on the 60
     OSS/OST SharePoint website.
  6.8.4. Unit Responsibilities:
     6.8.4.1. No later than the last week in October of each year, provide OG/CC
     (AFRC/A3TA for AFRC units) with the estimated training requirements (initial
     qualification, requalification, upgrade, ATD refreshers, and additional simulator training
     time) of their units for the next fiscal year.
     6.8.4.2. When filling initial, requalification, and upgrade course allocations, ensure
     allocation RIPs are sent to the unit MPF with the minimum: course, class number, grade,
     name, and SSN of the individual scheduled for training. Crewmembers are to be
     reminded to receive an ADSC briefing by MPF prior to attending training (N/A AFRC).
80                           AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


     When training involves TDY, it is unit funded. In this case, units must provide fundcite
     to the applicable MPF.
     6.8.4.3. No later than 45 days prior to the class start date, units must inform AMC/A3TF
     ( AFRC/DPTF for AFRC units) and MPF or DPMPC with class number, name, and a
     SSN of personnel attending.
        6.8.4.3.1. AMC/A3TF will forward this information to contractor site managers at
        the beginning of every month. The contractor site manager will compare the
        AMC/A3TF list to the PFT to ensure every course on the AMC/A3TF list has the
        same number of students as the PFT. On the first day of class, the contractor will also
        ensure only the students designated on the AMC/A3TF list are trained. If no student
        or the wrong student attends the class, the contractor will coordinate with the unit and
        AMC/A3TF to correct the problem.
     6.8.4.4. Thirty (30) days prior to the start of a new quarter, all units must notify
     AMC/A3TF of all allocations they do not plan to use during that quarter.
     6.8.4.5. AMC/A3TF makes unused allocations available to other units. Normally, AMC
     allocated slots remain AMC slots until relinquished by AMC/A3TF. Conversely, AFRC
     slots remain AFRC slots until relinquished by AFRC/A3TA.
     6.8.4.6. Units desiring to trade quotas may do so without AMC headquarters‘ approval;
     however, they must inform AMC/A3TF and all appropriate agencies and units.
     6.8.4.7. Requests for additional training quotas will be submitted directly to AMC/A3TF
     with information copies to OG/CC and AFRC/A3TA (if applicable). AMC/A3TF will
     take required action and inform applicable command formal training (DPPET-AMC and
     DPTF-AFRC) of any new authorized classes.
     6.8.4.8. Coordinate aircrew refresher and additional training time scheduling
     requirements with the applicable training facility. The unit will work with the training
     facility manager to establish mutually agreeable and effective scheduling procedures. As
     a minimum, in accordance with the contract, the contractor will provide next quarter‘s
     schedule to the units 45 days prior to the start of the quarter. Units will designate which
     unit will use each training period and cancel any training that is not needed. Units will
     then return the schedule with squadron assignment no later than 20 days prior to the start
     of the quarter. Each active duty and AFRC associate unit will coordinate closely when
     scheduling ATD training. Training slots that cannot be filled by one unit must be offered
     to other units in a timely manner. Training slots should not go unfilled unless absolutely
     unavoidable.
     6.8.4.9. Ensure the training contractor is kept apprised of scheduling changes or training
     requirements. The contractor should be provided as much advance notice as practical.
     6.8.4.10. When practical, the contractor will schedule one ATT per week per active duty
     squadron. These ATTs will be scheduled so they may be used for crewmember
     evaluations on the third consecutive day following a two-day refresher. Intent is to move
     active duty simulator evaluations out of quarterly refresher periods and into ATT
     simulator periods.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                               81


      6.8.4.11. When practical, squadrons will use these ATT periods to schedule active duty
      recurring simulator evaluations. If practical, try to schedule more than one evaluation
      during the same ATT, i.e. a pilot and flight engineer who are both in their eligibility
      window. Units should also strive to maintain crew integrity throughout the 3-day period.
      6.8.4.12. Squadron Schedulers will notify the contractor training administrator with the
      names of the students for refresher ATD periods. The squadron scheduler may replace
      individuals to meet mission requirements. If the squadron cannot fill the training session
      with a full crew, the contractor must be notified of the cancellation by 1600 Local, the
      work day prior to the scheduled training. When the squadron does not fill the scheduled
      training session and does not notify the contractor administrator of a cancellation, this
      constitutes a "no-show." No-shows are submitted to AMC on the contractor monthly
      throughput report. Det 1 AMCAOS will notify squadron Director of Operations of any
      "no-shows" incurred by the squadron.
   6.8.5. Simulator Tours: See paragraph 6.13.
6.9. Administration:
   6.9.1. ATS Feedback.
      6.9.1.1. Air Force-appointed ATS PO/QARs are primary focal points and the liaison
      agency between the Air Force and the ATS contractor. PO/QARs are the only Air Force
      personnel empowered to evaluate any component of contract compliance. These
      individuals are entrusted with quality assurance, are the only appropriate office (unit-
      level) to direct contractor to perform or stop work via the Administrative Contracting
      Officer's (ACO) or Procurement Contracting Officer's (PCO) direction, and are
      accountable for these actions. Each wing or group commander will establish ATS
      PO/QARs positions and enforce directives, requirements, and procedures established by
      DoD and MAJCOM directives and publications. ATS PO/QARs must maintain a current
      copy of the ATS contract(s), designated quality assurance regulations and directives, and
      quality assurance procedures.
      6.9.1.2. Operational Evaluation. The ATS contractor is required to evaluate the ATS
      program (both formal and non formal) and its graduates‘ on-the-job performance. The
      objective of this ongoing ―operational evaluation‖ is to assure the ATS produces qualified
      graduates. The contractor‘s system will ensure a steady flow of information to maintain
      quality, effectiveness, and currency in the ATS. Revisions to the ATS will be based on
      this information.
      6.9.1.3. Feedback includes inputs from graduates, flight commanders (or designated
      representatives), and examiners. Analysis of actual performance (Air Force evaluation)
      and trainee critique data help to determine if graduates‘ on-the-job performance meets
      MTL and established performance standards. The importance of this on-the-job
      performance feedback from graduates, flight commanders, and examiners cannot be
      overemphasized. This data is vital to establishing a database to identify trends and
      support revisions to the ATS.
   6.9.2. ATS Data Collection. Internal and external data will be collected, reported, and
   corrective actions taken according to approved operation evaluation plan.

6.10. Training Implementation/Student Expectation:
   6.10.1. Crew Member Preparation. The crew member is responsible for adequate
   preparation prior to reporting for each ATD mission. This includes a review of the mission
   profiles, pre-course study material, all associated normal, abnormal, and emergency
   procedures, and applicable aircraft systems. The FE CBT systems review will be
   accomplished during the quarter for those systems topics.
   6.10.2. Mission Pre-Briefing. Prior to each ATD mission, the instructor will brief crew
   members on mission objectives, specific training items to be accomplished, scheduled
   systems and performance training, crew resource management, and any additional area of
   emphasis. The briefing should include data and information necessary to complete the
   mission, special procedures, and aircraft systems. The information presented in the briefing
   should correlate to the tasks to be reinforced in the training device. It should include any
   changes or adjustments to pre-positioned data and a review of the overall mission and
   coordination of individual crewmember responsibilities. Prior to executing the scheduled
   training event, a designated crewmember should conduct a mission briefing covering AFI 11-
   2KC-10 Volume 3 briefing items.
   6.10.3. Mission Debrief. Following ATD missions, all aspects of the mission will be
   discussed. Emphasis will be placed on all observed weak areas. The crew is required to enter
   maintenance discrepancies in the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document prescribed by T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policy and Procedures and debrief the maintenance technician.
6.11. Browsing Training Products. KC-10 crewmembers and engine-run personnel are
encouraged to browse any and all lessons, guides, and material within the ATS. This is
particularly appropriate to those crewmembers preparing to enter upgrade courses. Use the
following guidelines:
   6.11.1. Browser time is on a space-available basis.
   6.11.2. Coordinate browser requests with the local ATS site manager.
   6.11.3. Trainees are not to be scheduled to browse lessons for remediation. Remediation
   will be scheduled by coordinating with the ATS contractor. Browsing a lesson does not
   enable the trainee to take the end-of-lesson test. Trainees in remediation will be enrolled in
   lessons for review in order to take the end-of-lesson test and keep a permanent record of the
   remediation.
6.12. Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors.
   6.12.1. ATS Contractor Personnel Flight Operations. ATS Training Instructors observe in-
   flight operations according to AFI 11-401 and the KC-10 ATS contract. Flights will be
   accomplished according to the terms and conditions of a current government contract. ATS
   contract instructors who observe local missions (defined as training missions originating and
   returning to home station) may observe the mission in Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)
   status. ATS contract instructors are authorized (at the Aircraft Commander's discretion) to
   occupy the flight deck during any phase of flight. As MEPs, ATS contract instructors may
   observe all portions of KC-10 training missions to include tactical maneuvers, receiver air-to-
   air refueling, tanker air-to-air refueling, touch-and-go landings, and full stop taxi back
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                   83


   landings. ATS contract instructors are not authorized access to flight controls nor shall they
   occupy a primary crew position. Units detail local requirements in a supplement to this AFI.
      6.12.1.1. The ATS contractor shall identify, publish and update (as appropriate) a list of
      ATS training instructors who plan to fly aboard KC-10 aircraft on observation missions.
      Personal factors such as life insurance restrictions may dictate the instructor‘s status. The
      contractor‘s list will clearly indicate the status for each instructor. Maintain the list with
      AMC/A3TK. Coordinate requests to observe in-flight training requirements with the
      appropriate OG/CC or equivalent.
      6.12.1.2. The ATS contractor will provide written procedures for their instructor
      personnel outlining their compliance with the current KC-10 ATS contract. Included in
      these procedures are requirements to provide updated instructor lists of authorized
      personnel for flights, instructor requirements prior to flight and during flight, compliance
      with USAF safety procedures, and ATS contractor responsibility to return individuals to
      home station by commercial means at their expense if required.
      6.12.1.3. ATS contractor instructors are required to fly a minimum of one time per year
      subject to OG/CC concurrence and the ATS contract.
6.13. ATS Facility Tours.
   6.13.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for KC-10 ATS facility tours with
   the contractor as soon as possible, but at least 24 hours in advance to ensure the tour will not
   impact simulator maintenance or training. Training will not be affected to meet a tour time
   and tours requiring whole periods or a significant part of simulator periods will typically not
   be supported. The fifteen-minute break during each WST is the most opportune time to
   accomplish an orientation without adversely affecting training.
   6.13.2. Facility tours may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. Air
   Force option time may be used at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-
   available basis and will not displace scheduled training events.
   6.13.3. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
   conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.
   The contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.
6.14. Aircrew Evaluation:
   6.14.1. General. The decision of the Air Force examiner as to the ability of the aircrew
   member to meet qualification levels as set forth in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, shall be final and
   will not be subject to question by the contractor. An AF Form 8 will be completed for all
   initial and recurring simulator evaluations. Less than qualified performance will be
   documented as Qualification Level 3.
      6.14.1.1. Initial Qualification Evaluations. Prior to commencing Phase IB flight training
      in the KC-10, each crew member will be administered an evaluation (Q-005 or Q-006 as
      appropriate) in the applicable ATD; evaluation will be used to evaluate the effectiveness
      of contractor training as well as the capabilities and proficiency of the student. Each
      initial qualification (IQ) training device evaluation shall be conducted using either
      contractor-developed (and Air Force approved) mission scenarios or local unit
      standardization-evaluation (Stan/Eval) developed scenarios (Exception: BO evaluations
 84                            AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


       will be conducted using contractor-developed (Air Force-approved) scenarios). For unit-
       developed profiles, the examiner must coordinate with the contractor a minimum one day
       prior to the evaluation and ensure it is compatible with ATD software. In the event of an
       unqualified rating (ATD or in-flight), a Qualification Level 3 AF Form 8 is issued to
       document the unqualified performance and the contractor is responsible for all retraining
       (ground-based) in those phases and sub-phases determined to be under the direct control
       of the contractor. A joint contractor and Air Force review board consisting of crew
       specialty representatives from Group level training, FTU (if an in-flight evaluation),
       Group and/or Squadron Stan/Eval and appropriate contractor personnel will review the
       aircrew member‘s performance and determine those phases of the ground based courses
       that require additional training to meet qualification levels.
       6.14.1.2. Recurring Evaluations. Recurring ATD evaluations will be given using either
       contractor-developed refresher profiles, evaluation profiles, or Air Force examiner
       provided profiles. Exception: BO evaluations will be conducted using contractor
       developed (Air Force approved) scenarios. For unit-developed profiles, the examiner
       must coordinate with the contractor a minimum one day prior to the evaluation and
       ensure it is compatible with ATD software. In the event of an evaluation failure (in-flight
       or ATD), the appropriate ATD should be used to the maximum extent possible for
       retraining and rechecks. Usually, additional training and rechecks will be accomplished
       during a unit‘s scheduled ATT periods. In all cases, the unit must coordinate with the
       training contractor for ATD or instructor availability. In some cases, it may be necessary
       to cancel or reschedule training to accomplish the desired corrective actions.
6.15. (Added-TRAVIS) Persons desiring official (non-military) tours or simulator
orientation rides will contact 60 AMW Public Affairs, at least 2 weeks in advance for an
aircraft tour and 30 days in advance for a simulator. Specify simulator or KC-10 aircraft.
Other required information includes date and time desired, as well as number of people
attending. 60/349 AMW/PA will forward required info to 60/349 OSS/OST for coordination.
KC-10 simulator time is generally not available for this purpose; however, efforts will be made
to meet desires. 60/349 OG/CD approval or higher is required to override scheduled training. If
available, 60/349 OSS/OST will coordinate for a pilot and Flight Safety will provide a simulator
operator for required official tours. Family member visits and tours will be coordinated through
OST at least 1 week in advance. All escort requirements will be the crew member‗s
responsibility. Tours scheduled through PA should be coordinated 30 days prior to allow for
appropriate forecasting of WST utilization. All unofficial visits (those not having 60/349
OG/CD or higher approval) within the facility, to include family tours, needs to be coordinated
with and approved by the PO/QAR. (Note: contract requirements will limit the contractor to
providing facility access to official visitors only. All other access must be authorized by the
PO/QAR.) Visitor approval will be based on compliance with contract requirements and other
procedures agreed upon by the ATS contractor, 60 OSS/OSTT and the PO/QAR.

   7.9.20. G231–Initial CRM. Introduces AMC common core subjects (according to AFI 11-
   290), as supplemented. If initial CRM is not accomplished at the formal school, it must be
   accomplished within 1 year of reporting to home station. Aircraft and crew-specific CRM
   training conducted according to AFI 11-290, as supplemented, provides new crew members
   with training on how to successfully use all crew members to resolve problem situations.
   Taught by ATS contractor using building block approach. G231 training will consist of 1-
   day workshop. Part of Phase IA training for all initial qualification crew members regardless
   of previous weapons system experience. Initial CRM is not required for requalification or
   upgrade courses. G231 satisfies G230 and G240. OPR is AMC/A3T.
   7.9.21. G232–Instructor/Evaluator CRM. Training emphasizes the instructor‘s role by
   reinforcing CRM concepts during pre-briefs, WST missions, and post mission critiques. A
   one-time event taught by contractor during instructor upgrade.

   simulator training (MOST) conducted according to AFI 11-290, as supplemented. Provides
   hands-on application of classroom-presented CRM refresher concepts through CRM WST
   training, addressing human factors issues in a realistic mission scenario. Training in the
   WST with a full crew complement, addressing human factors issues in a realistic mission
   scenario, is desired. As a minimum two pilots must be present. G230 is a pre-requisite for
   G240 and is accomplished as part of the pre-briefs before the G240-CRM WSTs. OPR is
   AMC/A3T.
       7.9.22.1. Additional Information: The recommended minimum crew size for this
       course is an aircraft commander, MPD pilot, flight engineer and boom operator. If
       MAJCOMs authorize less than the recommended crew complement to attend refresher
       training, the affected units will ensure that the ATS contractor is able to support the
       missing crewmembers. Although crew training is more effective with FE and BO
       present, FE and BO need not be present for crew to receive credit. For Pilots and Flight
       Engineers, G240 is accomplished as one of the required quarterly refreshers missions and
       will be dual logged with G250.
7.9.23. G250–Refresher WST. Specific training accomplished must be annotated on a MAR,
(See Chapter 4 for training events that can be accomplished or logged in ATDs). Contractor-
administered simulator refresher courses (KC-10 PFREF) of instruction for aircraft commanders,
pilots, and FEs. Consists of two WST periods per quarter (each period consist of: 2.0 hours pre-
brief, 4.0 hour WST period, and 1.0 hour de-brief) emphasizing crew coordination, normal,
abnormal, emergency procedures, aircraft performance, as well as aircraft systems. Det 1-

approved quarterly refresher profiles will include, as a minimum, the abnormal and emergency
procedures listed in 7.9.23.1 and 7.9.23.2 below. Det 1 may substitute/delete single items on the
list once per year to accommodate emphasis items or for accomplishing abnormal/emergency
procedures requiring additional time. One WST period may be utilized for recurring simulator
evaluation. Evaluation will consist of complete instrument evaluation (aircraft commander and
pilot) and applicable portions of a qualification evaluation. Recurring simulator evaluations
should be administered to two pilots and one FE as much as possible. This will minimize
number of evaluation periods required as well as minimize negative impacts on refresher
training.

       7.10.5.7. Additional Information: See AFI 11-301 Volume 1 and applicable MAJCOM
       guidance.
7.11. Mission-Specific (M) Events.
   7.11.1. M010–Proficiency Sortie. Provides crewmembers specific guidance on items that
   should be accomplished during local training sorties that will emphasize core skills. See
   requirements listed below by crew position.
       7.11.1.1. Pilots: As a minimum, a pilot proficiency sortie will consist of the following:
          7.11.1.1.1. Three instrument approaches
          7.11.1.1.2. Missed approach
          7.11.1.1.3. VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting)
          7.11.1.1.4. In addition, the following should be accomplished when available and
          applicable:
          7.11.1.1.5. Circling approach
          7.11.1.1.6. Holding pattern or procedure turn (to include entry) Notes: 1. If flown
          in the aircraft, once the exercise commences, it should not be disrupted for any other
          type of training. A minimum of 1.5 flying hours (1 hour for ARC) should be
          scheduled for this event. Must be accomplished with an IP (formal school instructors
          are exempt from the IP requirement). IPs should accomplish their M010
          requirements with another IP on board the aircraft. 2. If accomplished in the WST,
          the M010 event does not require any specific time requirements as long as the
          requirements listed above are met. Pilots should focus on instrument proficiency with
          all engines/systems operating. This event is not intended to be logged while handling
          multiple aircraft malfunctions. If an M010 is accomplished in the WST, the students
          must be under the supervision of an IP or an ATS contractor pilot instructor.       3.
          Because holding is incorporated into the quarterly refresher simulator profile, M010
          time need not be spent on holding unless further training is necessary.         4. If
          circumstances prevent completion on one sortie (aircraft or WST), credit may be
          taken after a second IP-supervised sortie, provided the combined activity fulfills the
          intent of this paragraph. 5. Instructors should tailor each M010 to the individual
          pilot's needs.
       7.11.1.2. Flight engineers: To credit a proficiency sortie, flight engineers must
       complete a full preflight inspection, perform the required pre-departure activities, and
       applicable panel duties and checklists for the type mission flown. Half of the semiannual
       requirements may be credited by performing a through-flight inspection versus a
       complete preflight inspection, provided all other duties associated with a proficiency
       sortie are accomplished. Flight Engineers should also complete manual TOLD.
       Exception: AFRC flight engineers may credit a sortie for missions flown where a
       preflight inspection was not possible (e.g., ERCC,), and a preflight inspection was
       accomplished at another time. When a preflight is accomplished (not associated with or
       after flight), log a preflight event P361. When required, combine the preflight and
       through-flight proficiency sortie events by logging an M013. Logging a combined M013
       will dual credit to M010 and update the monthly proficiency sortie currency requirement.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                               103


     7.11.1.3. Boom operators: For MBs, must be accomplished under IB supervision. For
     IBs, should be accomplished under IB supervision. Complete pre-flight through engine
     shutdown checklist items and an AAR contact or cargo load operations. The intent of
     this event is to review and reinforce all boom operator responsibilities while under
     instructor supervision. Note: If circumstances prevent completion on one sortie, credit
     may be taken after a subsequent IB supervised sortie, provided the combined activity
     fulfills the intent of this event.
  7.11.2. M013–Flight Engineer Proficiency Sortie, Combined (ARC Only). See M010
  flight engineer requirement.
  7.11.3. M020–Unit Specific Training Sortie (UST). Unit defined sortie to accomplish
  mission specific training events. The following is a suggested listing of events that can be
  used on an M020: any individual training event (approaches, landings, ARs); exercise
  training (RED FLAG, MAPLE FLAG); US Navy or Marine Corps drogue training; practice
  mobility training; night formations; large formations; night receivers and refueling; special
  mission tasking; special operations tasking; tactical navigation training; composite exercises;
  corrective training or identified weaknesses.
  7.11.4. M030–Oceanic Sortie. To ensure crews are proficient in oceanic procedures and to
  familiarize crewmembers with evolving ATC and 618th AOC (TACC) procedures necessary
  for worldwide mobility taskings. Sortie includes primary aircrew logging primary,
  secondary, instructor, or evaluator time outside the 48 contiguous states of the CONUS
  associated with a procedural oceanic crossing as well as a review of oceanic procedures and
  overseas (non-FAA) airspace regulations. Airspace considerations (MNPS, RNAV/RNP,
  AP1/2/3/4, etc.) for the intended route of flight will also be covered as well as a review of
  associated documents (to include but not limited to the MNPSA Manual, a sample NAT
  Track Message, North American Routes, and the North Atlantic European Routing System).
  Crewmembers must also review oceanic re-routing procedures. Discussions must emphasize
  critical CRM activities associated with a re-route, with a focus on updating the master
  oceanic log, the oceanic plotting chart and the FMS. OPR: MAJCOM/AMC/A3T.
     7.11.4.1. OG/CC may elect to substitute a CONUS sortie, coupled with an extensive
     review of oceanic navigation procedures, for the procedural oceanic obligation when
     aircraft requirements or crewmember availability is insufficient for accomplishing the
     oceanic sortie requirement. Consecutive CONUS sortie substitutions are not permitted.
     7.11.4.2. OG/CC at OCONUS units may allow accomplishment of an off station sortie
     which includes a takeoff (P020) or landing (P190) at a location other than home
     station. In all cases aircrew members are still required to review airspace and oceanic
     crossing procedures.
     7.11.4.3. Crewmembers performing instructor or evaluator duties may log M030
     provided appropriate airspace and oceanic procedures are instructed/evaluated during the
     sortie.
     7.11.4.4. Training Aids: G160–Overwater Navigation Procedures training located on the
     AMC/A3T CoP (see paragraph 1.15).

                       AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides standardized guidelines on proper
training documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder,
AF Form 4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training
Accomplishment Report, and AF Form 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, and aircrew
training guides. For electronic copies, digital signatures are authorized using "//signed//" plus
the individual's name. These forms are prescribed in AFI 11-2C-5 Volume 1, C-5 Aircrew
Training. Units may use the Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS) or
other AMC/A3T approved electronic gradebook in lieu of the hard-copy requirements described
in this regulation. Units must maintain all referenced documentation (training, reviews, waivers,
etc.) within the database when an electronic option is used.
   A2.1.1. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4022 ) for Table 6.2 formal training (either at
   formal school or in-unit), mission qualification/certification, special qualification or
   certification training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification,
   requalification training (either at formal school or in-unit), or for any corrective action or
   additional training.
       A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
       corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
       examiner who evaluated the aircrew member‘s performance will enter comments
       pertinent to the training deficiency on AF Form 4023 or the training guide. Use the
       existing training folder for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
       A2.1.1.2. At the unit‘s discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more
       than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF
       Form 4022; e.g., a tanker pilot upgrading to AC may have his or her upgrade, mission
       qualification/certification, and formation lead training combined in one folder.
   A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee‘s
   gaining unit. Squadron commanders will review formal school training records and enter
   appropriate comments on the training guide progress record or AF Form 4023.
   A2.1.3. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily
   accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder
   at any time. Electronic versions must be password protected to ensure data integrity.
   A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder prior to all training periods.
   Those areas not previously accomplished or those in which crew members require additional
   training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period.
   A2.1.5. Upon completion of training, complete and place an AF Form 4025 in the
   individual‘s training folder. Place a copy of the AF Form 4025 in the individual‘s FEF only
   if directed by the guidance implementing the associated training. Squadrons will retain all
   AF Forms 4022 for 1 year then return them to the crew member. Do not insert AF Forms
   4022, AF Forms 4023, AF Forms 4024, or training guide into FEFs. Document in ARMS
   per applicable event and paragraph 1.8.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                  153


   A2.1.6. Training Guides, AF Forms (4023, 4024, 4025), and/or unit overprints may be used
   for all KC-10 continuation and formal training. The current AMC/A3TK approved formal
   school training guides are available on the A3TK CoP web page:
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=AM-OP-00-
   13-3&Filter=AM-OP-00-13.
   A2.1.7. For purposes of training documentation, classroom-only training conducted at the
   unit should be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be
   considered all training conducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or
   aircrew training device (Exception: WST/BOT G events). All G series ground training
   referenced in this AFI will be referenced as (GT).
   A2.1.8. AF 4324, blocks 1 – 5 and 11 – 13, will be used to document any new aircrew
   certification and award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers and associated training
   profiles. Specifically, block 11 will contain the following minimum information: Q code
   (i.e. QXXX), Certification Name (i.e. Phoenix Banner), and date of certification. AF Forms
   1522s may be used in lieu of AF Forms 4324 to document new aircrew certifications that
   require award of specific ARMS Q code identifiers that do not require assignment of
   associated training profiles. Forward completed form to the unit SARMS section for
   processing. Once updated and signed, the letter of X's becomes the source document for
   certifications.
A2.2. Instructions for AF Form 4022. This form is a folder constructed of hard stock paper.
The inside covers have tables for documenting training. AF Forms 4023, 4024, 4025, and
additional information (waivers, memorandums, etc.) will be attached through the centered holes
of the folder. Training guides will be placed inside the folder. The form is available through
unit publications distribution offices or the AMC Command Publication Distribution Center.
Units may organize the 4022 to fit their needs provided all necessary documentation is included
in this folder. This includes the use of tabs and/or dividers when multiple certifications or phases
of training are included in one training folder (i.e. MPD folder with Phase I, Phase II, various
certifications, continuation training, PCO, Aircraft Commander MCT training). Comply with the
following when documenting aircrew training on the form. Note: Formal school instructors
using ATS courseware are not required to complete the following sections of the AF Form 4022:
ground training summary, written evaluations, performance evaluation summary, and flying
training summary if this information is tracked by other means and sent to the gaining unit with
AF Form 4022.

A2.4. Instructions for the AF Form 4024. This form tracks, for each sortie, individual event
and task accomplishment and grades. Units will overprint event and task listings, total number
of repetitions required, and the required proficiency level (RPL) for each event and task.
Maintain AF Forms 4024 on the right side of AF Form 4022.      Note: Training guides may be
used to document training instead of the AF Form 4024. The AF Form 4024 may be used for
ATS and formal school courses.
   A2.4.1. Name. Self-explanatory.
   A2.4.2. Crew Position. Self-explanatory.
   A2.4.3. Course or Phase of Training. Enter the AFCAT 36-2223 formal course identifier,
   e.g., KC10P. For special mission certification, enter the type and identify the method of
   training, e.g. WST training, flying training, etc.
   A2.4.4. Sortie. Enter sortie number e.g., S-1, S-2, FTD-1, etc.
   A2.4.5. Date.
   A2.4.6. Training Event and Task Listing. Reflects the tasks and subtasks in the training
   program that require specific student performance or knowledge proficiency standards.
   A2.4.7. Number Accomplished. Reflects the number of times an event was accomplished on
   that sortie.
   A2.4.8. Grade. Enter a ―B,‖ ―F,‖ ―P,‖ ―S,‖ or ―U‖ as appropriate.
       A2.4.8.1. ―1‖–Item must be accomplished once by the crew member, but does not
       require proficiency.
       A2.4.8.2. "B"–Briefing item only.
       A2.4.8.3. "F"–Familiarization item; proficiency is not required. The operations group
       commander or equivalent operations function will determine whether "F" items are
       completed by briefing, demonstration, observation, or actual accomplishment.
       A2.4.8.4. "P"–Proficient; crew member has achieved the required proficiency level.
       A2.4.8.5. "S"–Satisfactory; crew member has not achieved the required proficiency level
       but progress is satisfactory.
       A2.4.8.6. "U"–Unsatisfactory; crew member was previously proficient, but has regressed
       or progress is unsatisfactory. Note: Events preceded by an (*) are trained to proficiency
       by the contractor in the appropriate ATD during phase 1A; however proficiency in the
       ATD may in some cases not equate to full aircraft proficiency due to differences in the
       real-world flight environment. For this reason a student may be graded ―S‖ until full
       aircraft proficiency is demonstrated in phase 1B for an event graded ―*P‖ in the ATD.
       An ―S‖ grade denotes satisfactory progression and does not require contractor
       notification. However, once a crew member has received ―P‖ for an event (in phases 1A,
       1B or II), the only subsequent grade allowed is either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Likewise, multiple
       consecutive ―S‖ grades may indicate lack of progression and warrant a ―U‖. Any event
       graded ―U‖ must have an associated remark on AF Form 4023.
   A2.4.9. Total Number Required. Indicates the total repetitions of an event or task required
   by the course syllabus.

   A2.4.10. Total Number Accomplished.            Total of the number of repetitions actually
   accomplished.
   A2.4.11. Required Proficiency Level (RPL). RPL for the specific event and task. Each
   event and task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level
   the crew member must achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a
   knowledge standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The
   standards for specific events are either listed in the applicable master task list (MTL) and
   evaluation standards document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in this volume.
   For the KC-10, all events will have an RPL of "3" for performance and "C" for knowledge (if
   knowledge standards are used in addition to performance standards). KC-10 units may use
   ―P‖ to signify the RPL has been attained. Performance and knowledge standards follow:

       A2.4.11.1. Regression. Once a crewmember has received ―P‖ for an event, the only
       subsequent grade allowed for that event is either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Regression occurs when a
       maneuver is graded ―U‖ after having achieved ―P‖ in the same task. Regression from a
       ―P‖ to a ―U‖ requires an explanation in the student‘s training folder. The overall grade is
       at the instructor‘s discretion. For regression, the student will re-obtain proficiency prior
       to the end of the block of training in order to be recommended for an evaluation (when
       applicable) or certification (when applicable).
A2.5. Instructions for the AF Form 4025.
   A2.5.1. When a training folder is closed a single summary/closeout report (Form 4025) will
   be completed detailing the individual's strengths, weaknesses, overall performance, and other
   pertinent information.

   contractor is unable to provide them. TGs will be developed in accordance with AFI 36-
   2201, Air Force Training Program. Coordinate TG development through appropriate
   MAJCOM with an info copy sent to AMC/A3T.
   A2.6.2. Initiating TGs. Training and resource management personnel in each unit will
   initiate a TG on crew-members prior to their entering any phase of qualification training.
   These TGs will be inserted in AF Form 4022 and may be used in lieu of AF Forms 4023 or
   4024.
   A2.6.3. Use of TGs. Specific instructions for annotating training are included in each TG.
   TGs will be placed in an AF Form 4022.
       A2.6.3.1. Active status TGs will be carried by the student during all training and
       operational missions and made available to the instructor for review and annotation. The
       student will review the TG and initial the training progress record prior to the next
       training period.
       A2.6.3.2. Complete the training progress record portion of the TG in sufficient detail to
       specify areas of training accomplished, areas needing improvement, recommended
       specific study areas for the trainee, and recommended training for the next training

       upgrade, the instructor will recommend an evaluation and state: "Recommend evaluation
160                            AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012


      for (crew position)" on the training progress record. Trainees will not be recommended
      for an evaluation if a TG required event is incomplete or requires corrective action.
      A2.6.3.3. On missions without an instructor or examiner, the senior qualified counterpart
      (e.g. AC for pilots, etc.) will accomplish required training for those areas not requiring an
      instructor. Annotate applicable training information in the TG.
      A2.6.3.4. When an initial qualification flight evaluation is not successfully completed
      and additional training is required, the flight commander will annotate deficient areas on
      reproduced pages of the appropriate TG and training progress record. This mini-TG will
      be placed in the AF Form 4022 and used to document completion of additional training.
      A2.6.3.5. At the conclusion of training, when all requirements of the TG are met, fill-out
      an AF Form 4025 in accordance with this volume. Maintain completed TG and
      associated AF Form 4025 in a training folder according to paragraph A2.1.5.

                      FORMAL TRAINING UNIT (FTU) GUIDANCE

A3.1. General Requirements. Qualification training for KC-10 crew members consists of
Phases IA and IB requirements. Phase IA is administered by the training contractor and Phase
IB is administered by US Air Force instructors. Phase IA training is contractor-developed and
Air Force-approved. The objective of Phase IA training is to minimize aircraft flying training
within simulation and human factor constraints. Phase IB training validates transfer of training
from Phase IA; however, Phase IB training is driven primarily by training aircrews to
proficiency in receiver AAR, formation and various types of approaches, and landings as well as
experience in the differences of the real-world flight environment. Phase IB training
requirements and events are conducted under AMC/A3 approved syllabi. All Phase IB training
for most, if not all, students will be accomplished at the appropriate AMC FTU. Current syllabi
can be found at the following KC-10 CoP and contain event/grading guidance
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/docmain.asp?Filter=AM-OP-00-13.
   A3.1.1. Instructor Requirements. All flight training conducted under this attachment must
   be supervised by a qualified instructor of like specialty. Crew members undergoing initial
   qualification training will be under "direct instructor supervision" during critical phases of
   flight. Exceptions: The requirement for "direct instructor supervision" during tanker AAR
   is not required for initial qualification students after demonstrating proficiency in tanker
   autopilot-off AAR {R080} and recommendation for ―supervised AAR‖ by an instructor
   pilot. During initial qualification training, once the student demonstrates the ability to taxi
   the aircraft safely (no sooner than after sortie 1), they may be certified by their instructor to
   taxi without direct instructor supervision.
       A3.1.1.1. Two KC-10 IAC students or one PCO and one KC-10 IAC student may sit in
       the seats together for all events in which they are current and qualified.
   A3.1.2. The training and upgrade folder of individuals undergoing training under this
   attachment must be reviewed by the instructor prior to each mission briefing for each sortie.
   Areas that were previously identified unsatisfactory or unsafe must be reviewed and
   corrective measures discussed in detail with the student. In coordination with the FTU chief,
   the instructor will ensure that the training contractor is apprised of less than satisfactory
   activity of a student undergoing Phase IB training. If appropriate, additional academic and
   ATD training may be coordinated and scheduled with the training contractor.
   A3.1.3. All pilots will be dual seat qualified. Dual-seat qualified ACs must be capable of
   accomplishing AC duties from the left seat and pilot duties from the right (i.e. no
   requirement to be right-seat qualified in receiver AAR).
   A3.1.4. Prior to commencing Phase IB flight training in the KC-10 each crew member, with
   the exception of SSF students, will be administered an evaluation (Q-005 or Q-006 as
   appropriate) in the applicable ATD. This evaluation will be used to assess the effectiveness
   of contractor training as well as the capabilities and proficiency of the student.
A3.2. Initial Qualification Training. Conducted at the appropriate contract training facility
and Air Force unit. Training is designed to qualify aircrew members in specific crew positions
of the KC-10 aircraft. Initial qualification training requirements are found in the appropriate
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                163


syllabi. Specific course prerequisite, entry qualifications, and other requirements are listed in
Table 6.1.
   A3.2.1. KC-10 ACIQ–Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (PTX-1): Qualifies prior
   MWS, FAIP, and OSA Aircraft Commanders as a KC-10 Aircraft Commander.
   A3.2.2. KC-10 PIQ–Pilot Initial Qualification: Qualifies an SUPT graduate to operate the
   KC-10 from both seats but does not result in an Aircraft Commander certifiable pilot. The
   pilot will be Aircraft Commander certified in unit or via PCO per Chapter 5.
   A3.2.3. KC-10 FBP – Flight Engineer Basic Prequalification Course: Provides required
   training for Senior Airman and above with no prior MWS experience to successfully
   complete KC-10 FIQ follow on. Requires BFE (Lackland AFB) prerequisite.
   A3.2.4. KC-10 FIQ – Flight Engineer Initial Qualification: Qualifies prior fixed wing MWS
   Flight Engineer Senior Airman and above as KC-10 Flight Engineer. Experience
   requirement is at least three years as a performance engineer (fixed wing). Also qualifies
   KC-10 FBP graduates (see paragraph A3.2.3) as KC-10 Flight Engineer.
   A3.2.5. KC-10 BBQ – Boom Operator (Basic) Initial Qualification: Qualifies enlisted
   member as KC-10 Boom Operator. Requires BBO (CEA CoE) prerequisite.
   A3.2.6. KC-10 SSF – Senior Staff Officer Familiarization Course: The contractor-
   administered Senior Staff Officer Familiarization Course consists of three days of academic
   and simulator training followed by one aircraft flight. It is intended for familiarization only
   and does not lead to qualification in the aircraft. Senior Staff Officers who complete this
   course cannot log FP time nor be at a set of controls with passengers on the aircraft. Senior
   staff-level personnel who previously accomplished a formal KC-10 pilot training course that
   resulted in a Form 8 qualification (i.e., KC-10 SOC, KC-10 PCO, KC-10 IAC, etc.) receive
   credit for the KC-10 SSF course. Regardless of the venue of KC-10 SSF course credit, KC-
   10 SSF course credit expires 39 months from the date of the member's last KC-10 aircraft
   flight.
   A3.2.7. KC-10 SOC – Senior Officer Course: The Senior Officer Course consists of pre-
   course CBTs, 5 days of contractor administered academic and simulator training, and a
   maximum of four flights with Air Force instructors. This training is the minimum required to
   attain basic qualification in the aircraft with instructor supervision.
       A3.2.7.1. School Quotas for Senior Officer courses are controlled by AMC/A3TF.
       These courses are scheduled according to need in cooperation with the ATS contractor.
       Training throughput requirements may affect availability of these courses. Requests for
       training should be forwarded to AMC/A3TF/K (AFRC users contact AFRC/A3TA).
       AMC/A3TF will work in conjunction with AMC/A1A and AFRC/A1T to finalize course
       approvals and schedules. These requests must be submitted a minimum of 45 days prior
       to requested start date. AMC/A3 will be final authority should a disagreement arise
       regarding eligibility.
A3.3. Aircraft Commander Upgrade. Individuals may upgrade to aircraft commander via the
formal Pilot Check Out (PCO) courseor in-unit. The preferred method for aircraft commander
upgrade is PCO.

A3.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. Courses are designed to teach selected crew members
fundamentals and concepts of instructing.
   A3.4.1. Pre-course materials will be provided by the contractor to the unit no later than 35
   days prior to course start date. The package will contain a road map of the course,
   supplemental materials, pre-course reading assignments, and a course workbook. Squadron
   Training Units should request pre-course materials from the site contractor.
   A3.4.2. Specific course prerequisites, entry qualifications, and other requirements are listed
   in Table 5.3. All instructor candidates will be trained to a level of proficiency that will
   ensure their ability to instruct and supervise student activity. Successful completion of
   ground and flight requirements, including completing an AFI 11-202, Volume 2, as
   supplemented, evaluation, qualifies the individual to be placed in instructor status.
       A3.4.2.1. KC-10 IAC – Instructor Aircraft Commander Course: Qualifies current and
       qualified KC-10 AC as a KC-10 IP.
       A3.4.2.2. KC-10 FIC – Flight Engineer Instructor Course: Qualifies current and qualified
       KC-10 FE as a KC-10 IF.
       A3.4.2.3. KC-10 BIC – Boom instructor Course: Qualifies current and qualified KC-10
       MB as a KC-10 IB.
A3.5. Formal Training Unit. The flying phase of training is accomplished at the Formal
Training Unit (FTU). Although a considerable amount of time is spent mission planning for
sorties, due to the dynamic nature of the tanker mission, instructors are given great flexibility in
accomplishing activity during sorties. Therefore the syllabi provide a recommended number of
sorties, but training is complete once proficiency is gained in all the required areas.
   A3.5.1. In order to ensure continuity of training, limit the number of different flight
   instructors to a maximum of four for students undergoing qualification, requalification, or
   upgrade training (not applicable for all AFRC training and active duty initial cargo
   qualification). Squadron commanders may waive the four-instructor limit on a case-by-case
   basis. The flying squadron commander, operations officer, Det 1 AMCAOS personnel, and
   FTU Chiefs (Pilot, FE, and BO) do not count against the four-instructor rule. A copy of the
   waiver (including waiver justification) will be filed in the AF Form 4022. Additionally, each
   student will have one instructor who will monitor the student‘s progress throughout their
   training. This primary instructor will be designated, in writing, and will personally ensure
   the student is proficient in all required areas and is ready for evaluation if required.
A3.6. Failure to Complete Formal Training. Refer to the appropriate course syllabus for
guidance. The formal school will send a recommendation to the individual‘s unit on whether he
or she should complete training in-unit (which requires a waiver), be eliminated, or return to the
formal school for training.
   A3.6.1. Phase IA. An individual may be removed from Phase IA training if identified by
   the training contractor as incapable of successfully completing a course of instruction. A
   joint Air Force and contractor review of the identified student‘s record will be conducted and
   a joint recommendation made as to termination or continuation. The training contractor will
   notify the applicable squadron commander and Det 1 AMCAOS to determine the appropriate
   course of action.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_TRAVISAFBSUP_I 19 DECEMBER 2012                                                165


      A3.6.1.1. Det 1 AMCAOS will:
          A3.6.1.1.1. Review training records to ensure the training provided was within
          contract requirements and guidelines.
          A3.6.1.1.2. Review required procedures and assist local units in taking appropriate
          action to ensure that aircrew members who cannot meet training proficiency
          standards are eliminated from training. See AFI 11-402.
      A3.6.1.2. The squadron commander will:
          A3.6.1.2.1. Chair Air Force and contractor review of the identified student‘s record.
          A3.6.1.2.2. Request the contractor to provide additional training if appropriate.
          A3.6.1.2.3. If the student is to be eliminated from training, notify AMC/A3TK and
          AFRC/A3T (AFRC disqualification or suspension from aviation service), via
          message with information to the appropriate NAF/A3T if applicable.
   A3.6.2. Phases IB and MCT. If an individual is unable or unwilling to complete any phase
   of training, the determination of the appropriate administrative action rests with the squadron
   commander. (See AFI 11-402 for flight evaluation board [FEB] or administrative
   procedures.)
