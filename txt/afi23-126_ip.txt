                                             Chapter 2

         INSTRUCTIONS, PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MWD
                    PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT

2.1. Requisitioning MWDs. Requisitions for MWDs are independent of student training
quotas. These requisitions are maintained on a backlog listing by the 341 TRS and are filled on
an authorization-based, equitable distribution basis, with placement priority determined by the
priority listing described in paragraph 1.1.3.6.
     2.1.1. Requests for initial or increase in existing MWD authorization(s) will be forwarded to
         the Chairman, JSMWDC through the DOD MWD Program Manager stating where (by
     installation/fleet command) each new authorization will be applied. Service MWD program
     managers will validate the request against manpower authorizations. Funded manpower
     position(s) or billet(s) must be in place 90 days after the date the requisition is submitted. If
     the request cannot be validated or does not meet manpower criteria, new authorization
     increases will not be recognized and requisition(s) will not be entered. It is the responsibility
     of the Service MWD program manager to validate all authorization increases using these
     criteria. A memorandum, signed by the first O-6 or civilian equivalent in the Service MWD
     program manager’s chain of command, stating all requirements of this paragraph have been
     met, must accompany each request for authorization increase.
     2.1.2. In cases of requests for replacement of MWDs who have died, been adopted or whose
     life expectancy is less than one year, requests will include a death certificate, adoption
     paperwork or a letter from a veterinarian confirming the MWD is not expected to live beyond
     one year. The letter from the veterinarian must include the name of the MWD, tattoo and
     whelp date. MWDs will be used as long as they are physically and temperamentally fit.
     MWDs will not be identified as excess to requirements on the basis of age alone.
     2.1.3. All requisitions for MWDs must be sent in Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue
     Procedures (MILSTRIP) format. Major/fleet commands must submit requisitions through
     respective Service MWD program managers for validation.
     2.1.4. The using major/fleet command should order the type of MWD needed and
     authorized. Requisitions sent to the 341 TRS through the Standard Base Supply System
     (SBSS) will be canceled by the SBSS. Requisitions for MWDs may be mailed to the 341
     TRS/TTL, 1239 Knight Street, Lackland AFB TX 78236-5631, e-mailed electronically to
     MWDInventoryMgt@us.af.mil, or submitted in the Working Dog Management System
     (WDMS) using the following guidance.
        2.1.4.1. Air Force units requesting MWDs will submit an AF Form 601, Equipment
        Action Request, to their supporting Equipment Accountability Element (EAE) at the
        Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS). Include a requisition number on the bottom portion
        of the form (cc 36-49). The AF Form 601 will flow from the ELO to the Command
        Equipment Management Office (CEMO) for review. The CEMO will then provide the
        AF Form 601 to the MAJCOM/A7S for validation. If approved, MAJCOM/A7S will
        forward the AF Form 601 to the USAF MWD Program Manager for final approval. The
        USAF MWD Program Manager will forward the approved AF Form 601 to the 341
AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 7

          2.1.4.2.6. Brief explanation of mission change or reason for MWD order and
          appropriate documentation (death certificate, letter from Veterinarian, adoption
          paperwork, Service validation letter, etc.).
          2.1.4.2.7. Major Command MWD Program Manager (Army, Navy or Marine Corps)
          endorsement.
       2.1.4.3. US Army: Submit all requisitions through HQ DA (DAPM-MPO), 400 Army
       Pentagon, Washington DC 20310-0400, to US Army Soldier Biological Chemical
       Command, IMMC, Soldier Systems Team, ATTN: AMSSC-I-SSA-L, 700 Robbins
       Avenue, PO Box 57997, Philadelphia PA 19111-7997.
       2.1.4.4. US Navy: Submit all requisitions to Navy Expeditionary Combat Command,
       MWD Program Manager, Code N3-AT, 1575 Gator Boulevard, Ste 150, Norfolk VA
       23521-3024.
       2.1.4.5. US Marine Corps: Submit all requisitions to Commandant of the Marine Corps,
       Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, (PS), (Attn: MWD Program Manager), 3000 Marine
       Corps Pentagon, Washington DC 20350-3000.
2.2. Shipping/Transportation of MWDs. MWDs are shipped according to DTR 4500.9-R,
Part I; Passenger Movement; Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II, Cargo Movement and
AMCI Policy 24-101, Vol. 11, Cargo and Mail, also applies. All MWD transportation to
Lackland AFB must be coordinated with the 341 TRS Logistics Flight Freight Rate Specialist at
(MWDTransportation@us.af.mil).
   2.2.1. MWDs shipped Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) from or to
   Lackland AFB TX will be escorted by a qualified MWD handler. Escorts may be students
   who have successfully completed training. If an escort from Lackland AFB is not available,
   the appropriate Service MWD program manager will be notified and will be responsible for
   providing a qualified escort (at requesting Service’s expense) within 15 days of notification
   that an MWD is available. When possible, military aircraft will be used to ship MWDs to or
   from locations outside of the lower 48 states.
       2.2.1.1. Escort must make contact with carrier prior to any movement for current policy
       and/or restrictions for transportation of MWD.
 8                                                          AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011


     2.2.2. MWDs shipped within CONUS may be shipped by commercial air without an escort;
     however, situations may dictate an escort is required at the discretion of the 341 TRS (i.e.,
     live animal embargo due to weather, etc.). If an escort is needed, the escort must make
     contact with carrier prior to any movement for current policy and/or restrictions for
     transportation of MWD. Within CONUS, MWDs may be shipped as excess baggage, when
     escorted, or as commercial airfreight, when a handler is not available. Handler escorts will
     have sufficient funds to defray the cost of excess baggage using Controlled Spending
     Account. Included with all initially trained MWDs shipped against requisitions will be
     applicable DD Form 1834, Military Working Dog Service Record, and AF Form 2110A,
     Health Record.
     2.2.3. MWD shipments must be closely monitored by all personnel involved to ensure
     compliance with rules and regulations of carriers governing classifications and tariffs. Proper
     humane standards must be maintained at all times.
     2.2.4. All 341 TRS shipping crates, food pans and water pans must be returned to the 341
     TRS within 10 workdays after receipt of the MWD. Return empty crates by means of surface
     transportation or military air only. The gaining organization is responsible for shipping costs.
     Units in Europe can return crates to Gradlyn Kennels (GK) Air Freight staging for the next
     341 TRS procurement trip. However, to avoid shipping crates from other than CONUS or
     European locations such as Korea, the responsible person transporting the dog can bring their
     own crate with them to avoid having to return an empty crate.
     2.2.5. Shipper will pay freight costs for MWD when shipped as freight. When MWD travels
     with handler, MWD will be ticketed as Excess Baggage and charged to the traveler’s fund
     cite using Controlled Spending Accounts or Individually Billed Accounts.
2.3. Procuring MWDs. The 341 TRS is the only agency authorized to procure and distribute
MWDs for use by DOD components or other agencies participating in the DOD MWD Program.
Pre-screened dogs who meet qualification standards are obtained through procurement
(MWDProcurement@us.af.mil) or donation to the 341 TRS from United States and foreign
country sources.
     2.3.1. DOD components may be requested to support the 341 TRS by providing temporary
     kenneling facilities, veterinary and logistics support for MWD acquisition campaigns.
     2.3.2. Military veterinarians are responsible for performing physical examinations on all
     prospective MWDs to determine if they are medically suitable for the DOD MWD Program.
     2.3.3. When a dog is accepted as Government property, it will be assigned a tattoo number,
     which is placed on the underside of the left ear. Tattoo numbers will not be issued, changed
     or reassigned by any Service/Agency other than the 341 TRS.
2.4. Contractor Provided Working Dog Support. The use of contractor owned support
working dogs or dog teams will be restricted to those situations in which the DOD MWD
pipeline is unable to meet operational demands and such use is deemed essential for mission
accomplishment in terms of numbers of dogs and duration of use. Such use of contractor support
must be requested and coordinated in advance by the AFSFC DOD MWD Program Management
Branch (SFOD) and the Veterinarian Corps, through the requester’s Service MWD Program
Manager.
AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                    9


   2.4.1. Contract coordination will be conducted by a panel consisting of DOD Program
   Manager office, 341 TRS Operations/Logistics personnel and Holland Veterinary Hospital.
   This panel will review all aspects of proposed contract, and the DOD Program Manager will
   provide comments to the contracting agency within seven work days.
       2.4.1.1. If the 341 TRS cannot meet the Service requirement and contractor support is
       utilized, the requester will coordinate with the regional veterinary command or similar
       organizational commander to determine if DOD veterinary support is authorized and
       available. If such support is available, ensure the contract includes provisions stipulating
       the contractor will fully reimburse the government for all costs associated with provision
       of veterinary care. If DOD veterinary support is not available, the contract will stipulate
       the contractor is to be solely responsible for veterinary care and availability of its dogs.
       2.4.1.2. Animals provided by contractor normally are not eligible for military veterinary
       services. The exception to this pertains to contractor animals supporting a contingency in
       a theater of operations where military veterinary assets are already available.
          2.4.1.2.1. Emergency veterinary procedures required to prevent undue suffering or to
          save the life or limb of contractor animals may be provided by military veterinarians,
          on a reimbursable basis, as time and resources permit, before referral of such cases to
          a civilian practitioner for follow-up care.
          2.4.1.2.2. If applicable, and included in the provisions of the contract, non-
          emergency veterinary services may be provided to contractor animals in the theater of
          operations, on a reimbursable and space available basis, within the capabilities of the
          deployed veterinary unit.
          2.4.1.2.3. Payment for civilian veterinary medical care (emergency and non-
          emergency) of contractor animals in the theater of operations remains the
          responsibility of the contractor.
   2.4.2. Contract statement of work will require dogs or dog teams to be certified at the
   frequency and task performance standards as established by the using Service component
   directive for DOD MWDs.
       2.4.2.1. Although contractor provided working dogs must meet or exceed established
       Service component performance standards for MWDs, they will only be classified as or
       referred to as MWDs when procured/owned by the DOD.
       2.4.2.2. When the DOD owns the contractor trained MWDs and they are deemed excess
       per operational user standards, they are processed for adoption per attachments in this
       instruction.
2.5. Accountability. The 341 TRS assumes accountability for all dogs accepted as
Government-owned DOD MWD Program dogs. The 341 TRS Inventory Manager maintains
accountable records on all classifications of MWDs by a National Stock Number (NSN).
Accountability transfers from the 341 TRS to the gaining installation/fleet command upon
receipt of the MWD. Service MWD program managers may redistribute their MWDs within
their installations/fleet commands with notification to the 341 TRS. Redistribution to another
Service requires Service MWD program manager’s approval and notification of redistribution to
 10                                                     AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011


the 341 TRS. Written notification to the 341 TRS Inventory Manager, 1239 Knight Street,
Lackland AFB TX 78236-5151, must be made within 15 days after transfer.
   2.5.1. MWDs will be distributed from the 341 TRS to the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air
   Force and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at no cost to the gaining
   Service/Agency.
   2.5.2. Operational costs such as food, medical, transportation and other expenses related to
   the kenneling and welfare of dogs are considered common Service costs. When a shipment
   requires an escort/handler, the receiving Service must provide funding for the MWD
   shipment and the escort. Travel orders must include authorization for the traveler to escort
   military working dogs as excess baggage. Dogs supplied to other Federal or governmental
   agencies will be shipped on a reimbursable basis according to agreements between supplying
   and receiving activities.
   2.5.3. Adopted, Transferred or Deceased dogs will be removed from accountable records of
   the owning installation/fleet command according to appropriate materiel management
   directives. Within 15 days of adoption, transfer or death (includes euthanasia), the MWD’s
   original service record, DD Form 1834 (unit must have the final disposition and date boxes
   annotated), must be mailed to the 341 TRS/DOL Central Repository, 1239 Knight Street,
   Lackland AFB TX 78236-5151 for retention. In the event of death, a copy of the Death
   Certificate of Military Dogs may be faxed or emailed to the 341 TRS/DOL Central
   Repository, 1239 Knight Street, Lackland AFB TX 78236-5151 for retention. In the case of
   an adoption or transfer, a copy of the ―Covenant not to Sue with Indemnity Agreement‖
   (Attachment 7, Adoptions, and Attachment 8, Law Enforcement) and a copy of the adoption
   application (Attachment 9) must be faxed or emailed to the 341 TRS for retention by the
   adoption/disposition coordinator, MWD.Disposition@us.af.mil. (Refer to AFI 48-131, AR

       2.7.2.10. Semtex (SSD only)
2.8. Reporting of Worldwide Assets. WDMS is the accepted DOD program management
system for MWDs at all units. DOD components will maintain accurate data in WDMS and
report worldwide assets semiannually to the AFSFC/SFOD, with an information copy to
341 TRS/DOL, as of 31 December (to arrive by the 25th day of January) and 30 June (to arrive
by the 25th day of July). Reports will be reviewed and consolidated by the Service MWD
program manager before being sent electronically to AFSFC/SFOD. At a minimum, reports will
include entries reflecting major command/claimant, installation, fleet, type and number of
MWDs authorized and assigned, deployment category for each assigned MWD, number of
MWD gains and losses by type and number of serviceable kennel runs. Submit report every
six months (or more often if directed) in the proper format using AF Form 324, Military Working
Dog Program Status Report (USAF only). Service MWD program managers, other than USAF,
may use any suitable format provided all required data is included.
2.9. Redistribution and Reporting of an Overage of Trained MWDs. Only the 341 TRS will
authorize return of an MWD to the 341 TRS. Trained MWDs over and above the requirements of
a unit will be reported to the appropriate MAJCOM/ACOM/Fleet Cmd. MAJCOM/ACOM/Fleet
Cmd will determine if there is a need for the MWD within that command. If the MWD is an
overage to the command, it will be reported to the appropriate Service MWD program manager
for possible redistribution within that Service. If the Service MWD program manager determines
 12                                                         AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011


the MWD is an overage, a report will be sent to the 341 TRS requesting assistance in
redistributing the MWD to another Service/Agency.
   2.9.1. The overage report must be in letter format and contain the following information:
       2.9.1.1. Reason MWD declared overage (such as unit deactivation, reduced
       authorization, etc.) to include a statement that no requirement exists (include
       endorsements declaring the MWD excess to the MAJCOM/ACOM/Fleet Cmd and
       Service MWD Program Manager).
       2.9.1.2. Name, tattoo number and NSN.
       2.9.1.3. Age and length of service.
       2.9.1.4. Statement regarding MWD temperament and certification status.
   2.9.2. If the MWD is approved for return to the 341 TRS, the MWD will be dropped from
   owning unit/activity’s account upon acceptance at the 341 TRS. If instructions authorize
   redistribution direct to another DOD Component, accountability will be dropped by the
   shipping unit/activity and assumed by the gaining unit/activity on transfer of the MWD.
   Additionally, the transfer will be indicated in the accountability documents referred to in para
   2.5.
   2.9.3. When an MWD is approved for return to the 341 TRS, shipments will be made using
   the losing Service’s fund site. When an MWD is approved for transfer (either within the
   Service or to another Service), shipments will be made using the gaining unit/agency's funds
   cite.
2.10. MWDs that fail to Certify/Re-certify. If the MWD is unfit or unable to continue duties
in regard to training or fails re-certification, and concentrated retraining fails to correct the
situation within 30 days, the circumstances surrounding the situation will be documented and
will include the following documentation:
   2.10.1. Apparent cause of failure.
   2.10.2. A statement from the attending veterinarian to determine if the MWD’s physical
   condition has a bearing on the failure. DD Form 1829, Record of Military Working Dog
   Physical Examination, will be used along with other supporting documents to summarize the
   medical condition.
   2.10.3. A summary statement of retraining efforts.
   2.10.4. Complete copies of all training and utilization records for the MWD’s evaluation
   period, as well as any validation paperwork.
   2.10.5. A video (DVR or DVD format) documenting the MWD training problems that have
   resulted in certification failures, i.e., failure to attack, release, walking an odor or failure to
   respond to odor. Video must include live audio and show handler actions during trials. Video
   should highlight the following:
       2.10.5.1. Training shortfalls.
       2.10.5.2. Specific abnormal behavior examples.
       2.10.5.3. All phases of aggression.
AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   13


       2.10.5.4. Confidence course.
       2.10.5.5. On and off leash obedience.
       2.10.5.6. Detection skills.
   2.10.6. Send this documentation package to the 341 TRS/DORQ, 1320 Truemper Street,
   Suite 2, Lackland AFB TX 78236-5151.
   2.10.7. After review of the documentation, the 341 TRS will advise the unit to take one of
   three actions: Continue retraining efforts, decertify the MWD or retain at the unit.
   2.10.8. If an MWD fails to pass initial patrol standards or detection validations as outlined in
   Service program directives within the first 120 days of the dog’s assignment to the unit, the
   unit will submit the documentation described in paragraphs 2.10.1.-2.10.5. above to the 341
   TRS for action under paragraph 2.10.7. above.
2.11. Euthanasia. On the authority of the Accountable Unit Commander (AUC) or designated
representative, MWDs may be euthanized after consultation with the attending military
veterinarian. With the exception of medical conditions that warrant emergent euthanasia,
attending military veterinarians must consult with military specialists at the DOD MWD
Veterinary Service (DOD MWD VS), Lackland AFB TX. When an MWD is experiencing undue
suffering with a poor prognosis for return to duty, the attending veterinarian is authorized to
euthanize the MWD without prior consultation with DOD MWD VS personnel. Euthanasia must
be in accordance with acceptable standards as outlined in the American Veterinary Medical
Association’s Council on Euthanasia. Anytime an MWD is euthanized, the attending veterinarian
must complete and submit DD Form 1743, Death Certificate of Military Dog, listing the reason
for euthanasia, to the DOD MWD VS and provide a copy of this form to the unit commander to
allow requisition of a replacement MWD.
   2.11.1. An MWD may be euthanized under the following circumstances:
       2.11.1.1. To terminate suffering caused by disease, injury or permanent physical
       disability.
       2.11.1.2. To prevent the spread of contagious disease.
       2.11.1.3. When unable to perform as the result of an incurable disease or physical
       disability.
       2.11.1.4. When behavioral disorders are diagnosed that are not responsive to humane
       training therapy designed to return the MWD to normal use.
   2.11.2. When other conditions exist which may warrant euthanasia, such as viciousness or
   behavioral instability, the unit and the attending veterinarian must consult with the DOD
   MWD VS before euthanasia is authorized.
2.12. Disposition of Trained, Failure to Certify and Medically Eliminated MWDs. Military
working dogs must be deemed excess to the needs of the DOD, by the 341 TRS, before they are
disposed of by any DOD component or participating federal agency through sale, adoption,
transfer to Law Enforcement or euthanasia. The disposition process established by the 341 TRS
is governed by the requirements of Title 10 USC Ch 153 Section 2583. Once an owning agency
has determined their dog can no longer meet mission requirements, the agency may begin the
disposition process. The owning agency will contact the 341 TRS Adoption/Disposition
 14                                                       AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011


Coordinator (MWD.Disposition@us.af.mil) to identify their dog as a possible candidate for
elimination from the MWD program and to initiate the disposition process. No MWD procured
for utilization in the DOD MWD Program will be disposed of by transfer to any agency (i.e.,
medical, research and development (R&D) or clinical investigation) for the purpose of invasive
research or training that would potentially compromise the health of the animal.
   2.12.1. To initiate disposition of an MWD, the AUC, should submit a package to the 341
   TRS Adoption/Disposition coordinator. Air Force packages will be submitted through
   MAJCOM MWD Program Manager with an information copy provided to Service MWD
   Program Manager. Army packages will be submitted through ACOM/ASCC/DRU, with an
   information copy provided to the Service MWD Program Manager. Navy and Marine Corps
   packages will be submitted through the chain of command to the Service MWD Program
   Manager.
       2.12.1.1. All disposition packages will contain the following:
          2.12.1.1.1. Kennel Master (KM) recommendation usually signed by the AUC, letter
          must identify a medical problem or the cause of failure and a summary of retraining
          efforts.
          2.12.1.1.2. MAJCOM recommendation for USAF units, Service MWD Program
          Manager Letter for Army, Navy and Marine Corps units.
          2.12.1.1.3. Bite muzzle video (for dogs that have received Patrol Training).
          2.12.1.1.4. Bite muzzle test assessment form (for dogs that have received Patrol
          Training).
          2.12.1.1.5. MWD Adoption Suitability Checklist (AUC must indicate if dog was
          deemed suitable or not suitable for adoption).
          2.12.1.1.6. Training records (only if a training issue exists and will consist of training
          records from start of training issue to present or if unit recommends return to 341
          TRS as a training aid).
          2.12.1.1.7. Veterinarian letter to AUC (must describe the dog’s physical condition as
          it relates to performance failure and medical eligibility for adoption).
          2.12.1.1.8. Consultation/Referral Form from Veterinarian.
          2.12.1.1.9. DD Form 2619, Master Problem List.
          2.12.1.1.10. DD Form 1829, Record of Military Working Dog Physical Examination,
          rendered within 30 days of the report and containing a complete synopsis of the
          medical history.
          2.12.1.1.11. Relevant SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care.
          2.12.1.1.12. Relevant SF 519-B, Radiologic Consultation Request/Report.
       2.12.1.2. Any change to required supporting items or documents will be enumerated on
       the        341 TRS web site, www.lackland.af.mil/units/341stmwd, or published
       Disposition and Adoption Procedures Guidelines.
AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                            15


  2.12.2. Following the review of the package, the 341 TRS Disposition Review Board will
  provide a recommendation. If the MWD is deemed excess to the needs of the DOD, this
  written recommendation will be forwarded to the MAJCOM/ACOM/Navy/Marine Corps
  Service Program Manager.
     2.12.2.1. The Disposition Review Board may take the following actions:
        2.12.2.1.1. MWD declared excess to the DOD.
        2.12.2.1.2. Direct MWD stay on duty at present location.
        2.12.2.1.3. Direct return of MWD to Lackland AFB for use in training. The unit will
        coordinate transportation arrangements with the 341 TRS inventory manager and
        freight rate specialist.
  2.12.3. When an MWD is declared excess or unsuitable for DOD use by 341 TRS and
  deemed by the AUC as suitable for adoption, the MWD may be disposed of by:
     2.12.3.1. Transfer to a Law Enforcement Agency or other Government agencies.
     2.12.3.2. Adoption by a former handler or other persons capable of humanely caring for
     the dog.
        2.12.3.2.1. The appropriate ―Covenant not to Sue with Indemnity Agreement‖ in
        Attachments 7 and 8 will be completed for both an (adoption, private citizen) and a
        (transfer, Law Enforcement/Government agency).
     2.12.3.3. All MWDs will be neutered or spayed by the Veterinary Corps Officer (VCO),
     prior to adoption.
     2.12.3.4. Adoptions/transfers will take place at the kennels where the MWD is declared
     excess and the DOD will not incur transportation costs for adoptions.
  2.12.4. Humane euthanasia by VCO supporting the AUC when not disposed of under above
  methods.
     2.12.4.1. MWDs that are considered too aggressive for adoption should be considered
     for transfer to Law Enforcement agencies.
     2.12.4.2. The bite muzzle evaluation and video must be mailed to the 341 TRS for
     evaluation by Behavioral Medicine if the MWD is deemed suitable for adoption by the
     AUC prior to the final decision to adopt. Any MWD that has received Patrol Training
     must receive a bite muzzle evaluation. AUCs will consider the recommendations from
     341 TRS/SGV prior to adoption decisions. The only exceptions to the bite muzzle
     evaluation will be:
  2.12.5. The MWD is a danger to itself and/or others (these records will have a Behavior
  Consult in them with a "DO NOT ADOPT" statement, concurring with the VCO's decision to
  humanely euthanize the MWD).
     2.12.5.1. Completing the Video would severely compromise the MWD's welfare (severe
     injury/disease/pain; these records also will contain a Behavior Consult supporting this
     decision and providing a working prognosis if the MWD is otherwise adoptable).
 16                                                       AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011


2.13. Local Training of Qualified Patrol MWDs. With MAJCOM/ACOM/Fleet Cmd
approval, field units may locally train single purpose detector dogs that have received training by
the     341 TRS in explosives or drugs as patrol/detector dogs. Field units may also locally train
detector only MWDs as Patrol/Detector dogs. Units will contact the 341 TRS/DORQ for training
protocol prior to initiating training. Once local training is completed, the MWD must be initially
certified. Initial certification requirements are stricter than each Service’s installation
certifications. The 341 TRS/DORQ must certify locally trained explosive detector dogs as well
as patrol dogs as described above. The requesting unit pays for associated TDY expenses unless
other arrangements are made with 341 TRS. The requirement for 341 TRS to certify the MWD
may be waived by the Commander, 341 TRS, on a case-by-case basis. Request the waiver from
the 341 TRS/DORQ. The request must include copies of training records and full justification for
the waiver such as the local qualifying authority was assigned previously to the 341 TRS.
   2.13.1. An E-6 or above, knowledgeable of the MWD program and a graduate of the
   Military Working Dog Trainer/Kennel Master Course (formally known as the Military
   Working Dog Trainer/Supervisor Course), may qualify locally trained drug detector dogs
   (DDDs).
   2.13.2. After qualifying a patrol dog (PD) locally as a patrol/drug detector dog (P/DDD), the
   unit must request the award of a new National Stock Number (NSN) via letter to the parent
   command. The parent command will forward the letter to 341 TRS/DORQ. Include training
   records and qualifying documentation.
2.14. Inquiries Concerning Procurement. Persons offering dogs for sale or donation to the
Government should contact 341 TRS/DOLMP, 1239 Knight Street, Lackland AFB TX 78236-
5151, DSN 473-5895, or toll free 1-800-531-1066 or via MWDProcurement@us.af.mil.
2.15. Deployment Categories and Deployment Medical Procedures for MWDs. MWDs are
frequently deployed to austere environments with high operational tempos and limited veterinary
care. Consequently, it is important that all VCOs and KMs continually evaluate and prepare
MWDs in a consistent manner to meet medical readiness requirements. This ensures the MWD
arrives fit for duty.
   2.15.1. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 40-905/SECNAVINST 6401.1B/AFI 48-131 and AR
   40-3, it is the joint responsibility of the VCO and the KM to meet no less than quarterly to
   discuss the medical condition, training proficiency and physical fitness status of each MWD.
   VCOs advise and support KMs and MWD unit commanders on MWD medical issues
   affecting readiness and fitness for duty.
   2.15.2. MWDs will be assigned a deployment category as defined herein by the attending
   VCO in consultation with the KM. This deployment categorization serves as a valuable
   management tool to define current medical readiness for each MWD, and is intended for use
   by KMs, unit commanders and Service MWD Program Managers to apportion MWD assets
   based upon medical readiness and fitness for duty. Only the attending VCO assigns the
   deployment category. VCOs must ensure that the medical deployment categories of all
   MWDs are updated at least monthly, at every routine exam or sick call, or any time a medical
   condition develops that warrants a change in the deployment category. VCOs must also
   ensure this information is concurrently documented in the Health Record (HR), updated in
   the MWD database and provided to the KM and MWD unit commander.
AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                             17


  2.15.3. Deployment categories for MWDs are as follows:
     2.15.3.1. CATEGORY 1, Unrestricted Deployment.
         2.15.3.1.1. Medically fit for any contingency or exercise.
         2.15.3.1.2. No limiting or compromising factors (lack of stamina, etc.).
         2.15.3.1.3. No existing or recurring medical problems that limit performance.
         Chronic or minor medical problems may exist or be under treatment but do not limit
         performance. Medications or special diets are not considered limiting factors unless

18                                                     AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011


     2.15.4.1. Generally, MWDs must be in CATEGORY 1 status to be eligible for
     deployment OCONUS or outside their home theater of operation. For all MWD
     deployments, however, the final deployment authority resides with the MWD unit
     commander.
     2.15.4.2. VCOs will refer to deployment medical intelligence assets before deployment
     to determine any specific medical requirements. This information must be conveyed to
     the KM, MWD handler and unit commander to ensure widest dissemination of this
     critical information.
     2.15.4.3. All MWDs must have a physical examination and evaluation prior to
     deployment in order to confirm fitness for duty and to issue a health certificate.
     2.15.4.4. A Deployment Health Record (DHR) must accompany the MWD whenever it
     deploys from its home station. At the time of MWD return to home station, all new forms
     and data must be transferred into the permanent HR.
     2.15.4.5. VCOs must send an adequate supply of all chronic and prophylactic
     medications, such as heartworm and ectoparasite preventives, to last through the duration
     of anticipated deployment.
     2.15.4.6. Vector-borne infections are a major concern for MWDs in most deployed areas
     of operation. Aggressive vector control efforts are required. All MWDs must receive a
     monthly oral heartworm preventive combined with an intestinal parasite preventive and
     monthly broad-spectrum topical non-permethrin non-organophosphate acaracide or
     acaracide with insect growth regulator. These items will be provided by the attending
     VCO.
        2.15.4.6.1. Routine prophylaxis should be supplemented with amitraz collars and/or
        daily non-permethrin, non-organophosphate acaracide (such as fipronil spray), if
        necessary, when an MWD deploys to an area with high risk of tick-borne illness (e.g.,
        Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, the Balkans). All MWDs deployed to these areas are
        to be treated with low dose doxycycline        (6 mg/kg/d) (preferred) or tetracycline
        (6.6 mg/kg/day), as an additional prophylaxis against rickettsia and babesia infection.
        2.15.4.6.2. Routine prophylaxis should be supplemented with a four percent
        deltamethrin collar when an MWD deploys to an area with endemic or epidemic
        leishmaniasis and sand fly infestation (e.g., the Mediterranean basin, Southwest
        Asia).
     2.15.4.7. The VCO will issue a health certificate not more than 10 days prior to
     shipment.
     2.15.4.8. The attending VCO will instruct the MWD handler on general dog care and any
     special instructions necessary for the geographic region to include the following:
        2.15.4.8.1. Feed only the standard diet to MWDs, and only the prescribed diet to
        other MWDs as directed by the attending VCO. Ensure proper storage of MWD diet,
        with particular attention to rodent control and protection from contamination.
        2.15.4.8.2. Use only potable water for MWD.
AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                19


        2.15.4.8.3. Administer heartworm preventive and external parasite preventive
        monthly. Administer oral doxycycline or tetracycline with food and water as directed
        by the attending VCO. Remove medicated collars when the MWD is not under direct
        physical control in order to reduce risk of accidental ingestion and intoxication.
        2.15.4.8.4. Examine MWDs for external parasites daily and report any infestation to
        the KM.
        2.15.4.8.5. Employ heat and cold prevention measures, as appropriate, and
        emergency first aid treatment for heat exhaustion or hypothermia.
  2.15.5. MWD medical procedures during deployment are as follows:
     2.15.5.1. MWD handlers and KMs will watch individual dogs for behavior and health
     problems, and report problems to their supporting veterinary personnel.
     2.15.5.2. MWD handlers, KMs and theater Program Managers must establish reliable
     communications with veterinary assets in theater as soon as possible to coordinate
     veterinary support, medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) and emergency care policies and
     procedures.
     2.15.5.3. Because of the potential adverse effect on an MWD, use of non-approved items
     such as: cooling vests, pad covers, booties, ballistics vests, goggles and so forth, should
     be discussed with the KM and theater veterinary personnel before use.
  2.15.6. MWD medical procedures during redeployment are as follows:
     2.15.6.1. Because of the potential of introduction of foreign animal diseases, as well as
     the health of the MWD, the following actions will take place within 72 hours of arrival of
     an MWD returning from OCONUS missions:
        2.15.6.1.1. A physical examination and evaluation including submission of clinically
        appropriate lab tests, update of permanent HR and nutrition (diet and weight)
        information.
        2.15.6.1.2. Treat the MWD for any external parasites and internal parasites.
        2.15.6.1.3. The MWD will be separated from other MWDs as much as possible for
        14 days. The dog may continue to work during this time provided it does not show
        any signs of illness.
        2.15.6.1.4. Collect and submit post-deployment blood samples.
        2.15.6.1.5. MWDs returning to the United States from any region of the world where
        screwworm exists (e.g., Central and South America, Cuba, Southwest Asia) should be
        accompanied by a certificate signed by the VCO or a full-time salaried veterinary
        official of the exporting region stating that the dog was inspected within five days
        preceding shipment to the US and was found to be either free of screwworm or was
        found to be infested with screwworm and was held in quarantine and treated until free
        prior to leaving the region of export. These dogs must be re-examined at five days
        and 14 days after arrival at home station.

1. Military Working Dog (MWD) (Name/Tattoo number) is a (age, sex, breed, training
classification) dog that (synopsis of problem and what has been done to try to correct the
problem).
Example: This MWD has been medically reclassified from CAT II to Cat IV. It can no longer
effectively and consistently perform its patrol duties due to its irreversible medical condition [see
enclosed veterinarian memorandums for specific medical problems and diagnosis]. Along with
it not being fit to accomplish its patrol dog task, its detection abilities are diminishing as well.
This MWD still has the desired behavior to perform both functions, but due to deteriorating
health, its body can no longer keep up with the physical demands of our mission. It is our
opinion as well as our servicing veterinary officer that continued training and utilization of this
animal will only accelerate its medical condition to the point where it will be subjected to
unnecessary pain and suffering.
2. This MWD’s temperament is (provide a recommendation: usefulness as a training aid at the
341 TRS, suitable for adoption, euthanasia, etc.).
3. Request this MWD be declared excess to the DOD (or returned to Lackland AFB for use as a
training aid). For additional information, please contact (kennel master’s name, phone, email
address).

   PROTOCOL FOR BITE MUZZLE TESTING OF PATROL-TRAINED MWDS AS
                 POTENTIAL ADOPTION CANDIDATES

Purpose:


This protocol is designed to safely assess the interest of an MWD to attack on command a human
training decoy both with and without a bite sleeve and/or suit. Use these procedures to assess the
relative interest of the MWD in the decoy and training equipment, both when the decoy is
stationary and when the decoy threatens the dog or its handler. Use this protocol as an
assessment tool only and always under veterinary direction and appropriate training supervision.
Do not use these procedures repeatedly for training or other purposes. The results of the test
have value only when combined with other information in providing an assessment of an
MWD’s suitability for adoption.


Procedures:


Perform this protocol with the MWD on-leash and in a controlled area. Instruct all participants
on procedures with an emphasis on safety. Before the test is accomplished, ensure the following
is available:


1. Subject dog on a 360 leash
2. Person other than its usual handler (wearing civilian clothing)
3. One or two properly trained decoys wearing civilian clothing
4. One or more bite sleeves
5. Bite suit
6. Training supervisor and/or kennel master
7. Bite muzzle, appropriately sized
8. Video recorder and operator
9. Bite muzzle test evaluation sheet


Brief all participants on procedures with an emphasis on safety. Fit the MWD snuggly with the
bite muzzle and ensure that it cannot be pulled off the dog. The dog will wear the bite muzzle
throughout the test. Terminate the test immediately if the dog removes or partially removes the
muzzle, or if it appears overly tired or distressed.


TEST 1:
AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                    29


a. Set up the first test with a single decoy without sleeve or bite suit approximately 20 feet from
   the dog and handler. During this test, the dog will be on a slack 360 leash for safety
   purposes.
b. The decoy will approach the dog and handler. During this exchange, the handler will not
   provide the dog with any commands or direction. The handler may use the leash to control
   the dog for safety purposes.
c. At approximately 10 feet, the decoy will simulate an argument with the handler. After
   approximately 1 minute of animated argument, the decoy will approach and make contact
   with the handler, pushing, shoving, and grabbing at the handler’s sleeves and collar (but not
   knocking the handler down or striking the handler). The decoy will continue the simulated
   verbal and physical assault for approximately 1 minute. Rate the dog’s response to the decoy
   using the scale below.
d. The decoy will next turn attention to the dog and verbally assault and threaten (but not strike)
   the dog with hands, arms and feet. Rate the dog’s response to the decoy using the scale
   below.


Take a 5 to 10 minute break, and then return to the test area.


TEST 2:
a. A decoy wearing a bite sleeve and/or bite suit will begin the test at approximately 10 feet
   from the handler and the properly muzzled dog.
b. The handler will command the dog to attack. Rate the dog’s behavior for approximately 1
   minute using the scale below.
c. The handler will recover the MWD to a heel position.


Take a 5 to 10 minute break, and then return to the test area.


TEST 3:
a. Repeat Test 2 procedures but without the bite wrap and/or suit.
b. Leave the equipment on the ground approximately 10 feet to the side of the decoy.


SCORING THE TESTS:
Assign a score for ―Attack,‖ ―Contact Length,‖ ―Contact Behaviors‖ and ―Attempted Bite
Locations‖ for the dog’s performance for each of the three tests as well as a score for
―Protective‖ behaviors for Test 1 only (use Bite Muzzle Test Assessment Form Attachment 5).


Example:
 30                                                        AFI23-126_IP 13 DECEMBER 2011

Test 3 – A: 3, C: 3, B: 2, 3, L: 1, 2, 3



Attack:
1. Dog did not attack the decoy
2. Dog began attack, but broke off attack before contact
3. Dog hesitated during attack, but contacted decoy
4. Dog attacked immediately
5. Other (describe)


Contact Length:
