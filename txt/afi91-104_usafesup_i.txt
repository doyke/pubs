SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change (IC) adds new language in the introductory paragraph, specifically the
second sentence, to make this publication consistent with AFPD 13-5, Nuclear Enterprise. This
IC also adds AFPD 13-5 in the reference section of Attachment 1.

(USAFE) This document is substantially revised. This supplement provides information for the
USAFE nuclear surety tamper control program management.
1. Requirements and Procedures.
     1.1. Tamper Control Program. The Two-Person Concept is central to nuclear surety tamper
     control measures in the Air Force. It is designed to make sure that a lone individual cannot
     perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure on a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon
     system, or certified critical component.
        1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) This program also applies to controlled components and
        associated Communications Security (COMSEC) of the Weapons Storage and Security
        System (WS3) as specified in USAFE Instruction 33-201, Operational Doctrine for
AFI91-104_USAFESUP_I 22 MARCH 2012                                                              3


       Safeguarding and Control of Weapons Storage and Security System (WS3), and Technical
       Order (TO) 11N-50-1003, Console Group OJ-619/FSQ143(V) and Monitor-Indicator
       Group OD-203/FSQ-143(V) Weapons Storage and Security System AN/FSQ-143(V), and
       TO 11N-50-1004, Processor, Vault Control Group OL-398/FSQ-143(V) Weapons
       Storage and Security System AN/FSQ-143(V).
   1.2. Concept Enforcement. Each organization with a mission or function involving nuclear
   weapons, nuclear weapon systems, or certified critical components:
       1.2.1. Identifies no-lone zones (where at least two authorized persons must be present
       during any operation or task).
       1.2.2. Enforces the Two-Person Concept.
       1.2.3. Develops procedures to limit entry to authorized persons who meet the
       requirements of paragraph 1.3.
   1.3. Team Requirements. (Refer to paragraph 1.6.1 for criteria on foreign nationals.) A Two-
   Person Concept team consists of at least two individuals who:
       1.3.1. Are certified under the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), as specified in DoDR
       5210.42_AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program.
       1.3.2. Know the nuclear surety requirements of the task they perform.
       1.3.3. Can promptly detect an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure.
       1.3.4. Have successfully completed nuclear surety training according to AFI 91-101.
       1.3.5. Are designated to perform the required task.
   1.4. Violations to Report. Declare a Two-Person Concept violation when a lone individual in
   a no-lone zone has the opportunity to tamper with or damage a nuclear weapon, nuclear
   weapon system, or certified critical component. Report any violations according to AFI 91-
   204, Safety Investigation and Reports.
NOTE: A momentary breach of the no-lone zone is not a violation if no individual had the
opportunity to perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure. In performing certain tasks,
team members may lose sight of each other or be far apart. One team member may be briefly out
of sight to perform a specific task if it is unsafe or physically impossible to maintain constant
observation.

       1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Single file entry and exit by a two-person control (TPC) team
       into an exclusion area is permissible (e.g., into or out of the personnel access door of a
       Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS)/Hardened Aircraft Shelter (HAS).
       1.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Report Details. Refer to USAFEI 33-201 if a known or
       suspected TPC violation occurs with WS3 components or related COMSEC material;
       these components and COMSEC materials are not to be used in an operational WS3
       system until they are recertified using TOs 11N-50-1003 and 11N-50-1004 inspection
       procedures or replaced when re-certification procedures do not exist.
   1.5. Authorized Deviations. You may deviate from the Two-Person Concept when:
 4                                                 AFI91-104_USAFESUP_I 22 MARCH 2012


        1.5.1. The nuclear weapon system safety rules specifically authorize a deviation.
        1.5.2. An emergency presents an immediate threat to the safety of personnel or the
        security of a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component.
        War plan exercises are not considered emergencies.
     1.6. Additional Conditions:
        1.6.1. Non-US Personnel. Per AFI 91-112, Safety Rules For US/NATO Strike Fighters,
        for US custodial units at allied installations, foreign nationals may be part of a Two-
        Person Concept, and host nations will implement equivalent personnel reliability
        programs.
            1.6.1.1. (Added-USAFE) A properly constituted TPC team will have at least one
            United States (U.S.) team member. The U.S. team member may be interim-certified
            under the U.S. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) when paired with a non-U.S.
            person certified under the host nation's equivalent PRP. Non-U.S. personnel may be
            part of the TPC team at an open WS3 vault. Non-U.S. personnel will not be part of a
            TPC team in possession of WS3 Key or Code material or perform WS3 vault
            maintenance.
        1.6.2. Entry Control Personnel. The Two-Person Concept applies to individuals who
        control entry into a no-lone zone. Entry controllers may not form a Two-Person Concept
        team with personnel inside the no-lone zone.
        1.6.3. Couriers. Couriers ensure that the host installation meets Two-Person Concept
        requirements and no-lone zones are delineated around nuclear logistics aircraft.
        1.6.4. PRP Interim-Certified Personnel Restrictions. Two interim-certified individuals
        may not form a Two-Person Concept team. Also, an interim-certified member may not
        pilot a single-seat aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons.
        1.6.5. Nonqualified Personnel. An individual who does not qualify as a member of a
        Two-Person Concept team may enter a no-lone zone to perform a specific task only if
        escorted by a Two-Person Concept team. Escorts should be capable of detecting incorrect
        acts or unauthorized procedures. Escort procedures will be accomplished in accordance
        with the applicable directive(s) governing the nuclear weapon system or critical
        component defining the no-lone zone.
2. Tamper Detection Program.
     2.1. Sealing Requirements. Certain items must be sealed because either:
        2.1.1. Air Force nuclear weapon system safety rules require it, or,
        2.1.2. In the case of some certified critical components, seals protect their certification
        status while in storage or during transportation, as specified in AFI 91-105, Critical
        Components.
     2.2. Sealing Methods. Authorized sealing methods include:
        2.2.1. Safety Wiring and Sealing. Two types of seals are authorized using this method.
        The first method is seals composed of a malleable material are installed with a crimping
        device and controlled die in order to form an impressed distinctive mark or unique
AFI91-104_USAFESUP_I 22 MARCH 2012                                                                   5


       identifier. The second method is seals are applied with self-locking, non-reversible
       feature with a singularly unique serial number/alpha, color control system. Both types of
       seals are used with safety wire connected to certain switches, covers, handles, or levers.
       Breakage or alteration of the wire or seal provides evidence/detection of possible
       unauthorized acts, access or tampering. Use this method only in no-lone zones.
       2.2.2. Tamper Detection Indicators (TDI). In this method, an approved TDI is placed so
       it will indicate if someone has activated, or had access to the interior of a certified critical
       component. Once the TDI is installed, evidence of tampering is visible to the naked eye
       or can be detected through the use of special equipment.
           2.2.2.1. Tamper Detection Indicators and other authorized sealing methods proposed
           for use in nuclear weapons systems will be properly certified prior to use according to
           AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE) oversees the Air Force Nuclear Surety Tamper
   Control and Detection Programs. Acting for AF/SE, the Chief of the Weapons Safety
   Division manages the programs and certifies the design safety features of sealing methods
   proposed for use in nuclear weapon systems according to AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear
   Safety Certification Program.
   3.2. Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group (NWSSG) recommends sealing requirements in
   operational nuclear weapon systems and proposes specific nuclear weapon system safety
   rules, if necessary. See AFI 91-102.
   3.3. Major Commands:
       3.3.1. Develop and publish Field publications, as needed, to implement and enforce the
       Air Force Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs throughout their
       commands. Follow guidance in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, to
       develop and publish Field publications.
       3.3.2. Develop and distribute procedures for sealing, where appropriate. At a minimum,
       the procedural publication will:
           3.3.2.1. State when and by whom seals can be applied and removed.
           3.3.2.1. (USAFE) Requirements for Units Supporting Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA)
           are:
               3.3.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) U.S. Main Operating Bases (MOB). Only certified
               weapons loading personnel are authorized to apply and/or remove seals when
               flying operations are directed. Document each application of seals in an “INFO
               NOTE” on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
               Document, by recording the locally determined load crew identifier (not to
               include the unique impression), signature of the load crew chief, and the date and
               time of seal application. Upon removal of seals, enter the date, time, load crew
               identifier in the corrected action block and signature of the load crew chief in the
               corrected by block in the AFTO Form 781A.
               3.3.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS). The U.S.
6                                          AFI91-104_USAFESUP_I 22 MARCH 2012


       load monitor element will maintain a current list of non-U.S. personnel designated
       by the non-U.S. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) strike unit
       commander or designated representatives who are authorized to apply and remove
       seals. The U.S. load monitor element ensures only authorized personnel apply
       and remove seals when flying operations are directed. The U.S. load monitor
       ensures documentation of each application of seals is documented in the aircraft
       maintenance AFTO Form 781A or equivalent Host Nation form by recording the
       locally determined load crew identifier (not to include the unique impression),
       signature of the load crew chief, and the date and time of seal application. Upon
       removal of seals the U.S. load monitor ensures the date, time, load crew identifier
       (not to include the unique impression) is documented as removed in the aircraft
       maintenance AFTO Form 781A or equivalent Host Nation form.
    3.3.2.2. Establish controls for the handling, receipt, storage, issue, inventory, and
    disposal of TDIs (including all residue), controlled dies and self-locking, non-
    reversible seals (example: roto-seals).
    3.3.2.2. (USAFE) Requirements for Units Supporting DCA are:
       3.3.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Develop local written procedures detailing handling,
       receipt, storage, issue, inventory and disposal of operational dies and self-locking
       seals. Ensure local written procedures address the following:
           3.3.2.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Operational dies and self-locking seals are
           controlled and accountable at all times. Conduct inventories each time the
           dies or self-locking seals are accessed. Conduct inventories and inspections
           for serviceability on a monthly basis. All issues, receipts, inventories and
           inspections will be documented and documentation will be maintained for two
           years. The commander will designate in writing personnel authorized access
           to dies or self locking seals for issue and receipt as well as conducting
           inventories and inspections. Personnel designated for access to dies or self
           locking seals will not be authorized to install seals. Procedures will detail die
           replacement actions in the event a die becomes damaged or unserviceable, or
           if positive control of die or self locking seals are lost.
           3.3.2.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Dies will be marked with a unique impression
           and a load crew identifier, e.g., “AB1,” “AB2,” “1A” or “2A.” The unique
           impression and load crew identifier markings impressed by the die may be on
           the same or opposite side of the seal. Self-locking seals will be marked with a
           unique identifier and a load crew identifier or serial number. Additional dies
           or self locking seals may be procured prior to need or assignment to load
           crews. Procedures will include how the unique impression on malleable seal
           or self locking seals will be rendered indistinguishable after a seal is removed
           or die or self locking seal is damaged or unserviceable.
           3.3.2.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) One set of dies or sufficient quantities of self
           locking seals are available for each assigned load crew. Ensure one crimper
           (Part # GGG-S-735 or equivalent) is available for each assigned load crew.
           Do not use consolidated tool kits (CTK) for control or storage of operational
           dies or self-locking seals.
AFI91-104_USAFESUP_I 22 MARCH 2012                                                            7


               3.3.2.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Ensure applicable personnel, to include
               aircrew, load crews, load monitors, and other personnel required to check
               seals, are taught to recognize seal specific characteristics through briefings or
               as part of training sessions. Documentation as a specific training item is not
               required. For malleable seals, these characteristics are the locally developed
               unique impression and load crew identifier. For self-locking seals, these
               characteristics are the unit unique identifier and serial number or crew
               identifier. Whenever dies or self-locking seals are changed, the Maintenance
               Group Commander or Host Nation functional equivalent will provide prompt
               written notification to all concerned parties with knowledge of the codes.
               Mark and treat this notification “For Official Use Only.” This notification is
               performed by the Maintenance Group Commander, not the Operations Group
               Commander.
               3.3.2.2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) MUNSS. The non-U.S. NATO DCA unit
               controls receipt, storage, issue and disposal of dies and seals. Additionally,
                 3.3.2.2.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) The U.S. load monitor element must
                 ensure that non-U.S. NATO DCA units maintain a viable seal program.
                 3.3.2.2.1.5.2. (Added-USAFE) The U.S. load monitor section will assess
                 the host nation seal and die program monthly by conducting an inventory
                 and serviceability inspection as well as reviewing issue and receipt
                 paperwork. These assessments may be performed in conjunction with the
                 host nation’s monthly inventory/serviceability inspection.
        3.3.2.3. Direct that TDIs, controlled dies and self-locking, non-reversible seals are
        stored and accounted for by individuals not responsible for their installation.
        3.3.2.3. (USAFE) Store TDIs, controlled dies and self-locking, non-reversible seals
        in a secured storage container with access limited to issuing authorities.
        3.3.2.4. Direct personnel to comply with the following steps for malleable seals only:
           3.3.2.4.1. Place a distinctive marking (determined locally) on malleable seals
           using a crimping device and die.
           3.3.2.4.2. Be sure to destroy any distinctive markings on malleable seals after you
           remove them.
        3.3.2.5. Direct personnel to verify seal integrity immediately following installation.
        Note: For aircraft only, verify seals before and after any task or operation performed
        in the immediate area of the seal. Do not verify aircraft seals before an operation or
        task during alert crew member exercises or actual responses, but do verify the seals
        after the exercise or alert.
           3.3.2.5.1. (Added-USAFE) The immediate area is considered anywhere within
           the cockpit(s). Ensure both seals are checked, forward and aft, in two seat aircraft.
           3.3.2.5.2. (Added-USAFE) MUNSS. When upload is complete and the U.S.
           load monitor has verified seal integrity, they will inform the entry controller that
           the load is complete and provide the entry controller with the code of the seal
           applied on the aircraft. The seal checker, together with the aircraft commander,

       will verify seal integrity. Following download, the U.S. load monitor will verify
       removed malleable seals have been rendered unserviceable or used roto-seals are
       turned-in for destruction IAW locally developed regulations.
    3.3.2.6. Require periodic inspections of seals on nuclear weapon-loaded aircraft,
    missile systems, and certified critical components in storage or transport.
    3.3.2.7. Require that only Two-Person Concept teams install seals and verify they
    remain intact.
    3.3.2.8. Direct training of maintenance personnel, aircrews, missile combat crews,
    and other involved personnel to recognize distinctive marking or serial numbers of
    the seals.
    3.3.2.9. Prescribe a course of action when an installed seal is found broken or shows
    evidence of tampering. At a minimum:
       3.3.2.9.1. Investigate the event and send a mishap report according to AFMAN
       91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports.
       3.3.2.9.2. Establish procedures to maintain control of the system until situation is
       resolved.
       3.3.2.9.3. Check the integrity of the weapon system and reseal if integrity is
       assured.
       3.3.2.9.4. Prescribe a course of action when a seal is accidentally broken during
       authorized operations.
       3.3.2.9.5. Ensure training seals can be easily distinguished from, and are not used
       as, operational seals.
       3.3.2.9.6. (Added-USAFE) All DCA Units. For the situations indicated, follow
       these procedures.
           3.3.2.9.6.1. (Added-USAFE) When an installed seal is accidentally broken
           during authorized operations and all circumstances are witnessed by an
           authorized TPC team, replacement of seal is authorized by personnel
           authorized to install seals. Reporting of this circumstance outside of local unit
           requirements is not required. When an installed seal is accidentally broken
           during authorized operations and an authorized TPC team does not witness all
           circumstances, the reliability of the weapons system will be deemed
           questionable until determined otherwise. Reporting outside of the unit will be
           based on known circumstances of the breakage and any findings during
           recertification actions.
           3.3.2.9.6.2. (Added-USAFE) When an installed seal is found broken and
           circumstances of breaking are unknown, or the seal shows evidence of
           tampering, maintain control of the system and perform the following:
             3.3.2.9.6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Investigate the event and submit
             appropriate AVOID AMBER or AVOID RED report according to ACO
             Directive 80-6/EUCOM Instruction 6801.01, Nuclear Surety Management
             for the WS3. Additionally, when it has been determined that a tamper

                   3.3.2.9.6.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Perform weapon systems inspection and
                   Nuclear System Functional checks according to technical orders when
                   authorized or required by applicable weapons system safety rules.
                   3.3.2.9.6.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Perform a weapon status check according
                   to procedures in United States European Command Emergency Action
